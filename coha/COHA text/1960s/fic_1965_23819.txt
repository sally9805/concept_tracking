The Escape Artist A story by David Wagoner n the corridor outside the newspaper office he checked his empty pockets for the last time , tried brushing the wrinkles out of his sport coat , took ten deep breaths , and after running in place for a few seconds till the blood pulsed under his brain like a river under a canoe , he walked in fast . His reflection trailed him for a moment in the plate glass  --  the long profile he had hopes for , the sharp chin and nose he was going to cut down with a Vandyke as soon as he could make it grow ? and he went right to the first desk , in the flesh , himself included , not a daydream or a diagram . He felt only part of the stomach-fluttering , knee-twitching hesitation he 'd been afraid of during the months since he 'd known he was finally going to get himself out of the sticks and into the big city , into his Doom and Destiny  --  the grand words went up like balloons in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , after all the rehearsals . The middle-aged woman behind the desk kept on licking a stack of envelopes . She said , " Yes ? " with a bad taste in her mouth . He looked beyond her at the rows of desks where men bustled back and forth , where telephones , typewriters , and a clacking bank of teletype machines kept up a steady racket . " I 'd like to see the city editor . " He could feel the energy pulsing up from his shoes . It was like standing on a massage machine in a dime store . " Is it about a job ? " " No , I 've got a story for him . " She acted bored . " What about , sonny ? " " I 'll tell him . " She hesitated , then shrugged , got up , and began shuffling down one of the aisles toward the busiest-looking desk of all  --  three telephones , four kinds of in-and-out baskets , a sheaf of clippings , a nest of paper towels soaking up spilled coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padded swivel chair , interlocked fingers supporting the back of his neck . The woman spoke inaudibly for a moment , and the thin man motioned him nearer with his chin . " What you got ? " Waiting till the woman had gone , he took a deep breath and pressed it down against his diaphragm . He felt light in the head and light on 103 his feet . He was traveling light , and he was on his own . It was about time . He said , " I 'd like to issue a formal challenge to the police department : I 'll let them lock me up in any combination of their regular restraints , as long as they 're in good working order , and lock me in any solitary cell without a guard , and I 'll set myself free within an hour without damaging any city property . And I 'll submit to a complete search before and after . " " What 's your name ? " The thin man 's eyes were lazy and cynical . " Danny Masters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The thin man 's long face grew longer . " Through what , a phase ? " You heard what I said . I meant it . " " Kid , what 've you been reading , some old pulp magazines ? " " Do you want the story , sir ? There 's another paper in town . " The man laughed twice , high in his nose . " Can you really pick a lock ? " " I 'll repeat the challenge if you did n't hear it . " Taking one foot off the desk , the thin man let his chair straighten up . " You sound like your own lawyer . Come on , what you been reading ? " Danny turned to go . " Now wait a minute . " The man was out of his chair and sitting on a corner of the desk , smiling . " How old are you ? " " Seventeen in the fall . " " And fifteen last spring . " The man began swinging his leg . His eyes were going around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not if I can help it . " " Ever done anything like this before ? " " I can open any handcuff or any lock or get out of any rope-tie . " " What you need is a little self-confidence , kid . " The man was signaling to somebody across the room . " Who taught you all that ? " " It runs in the family , and ? What difference does it make ? Try me . " " I mean , I have n't heard of an escape artist since before flagpole sitters . " The man was lookDavid Wagoner 's novel , " The Escape Artist " ? from which he adapted this story  --  will be published by Farrar , Straus and Giroux on May tenth . This year , Mr. Wagoner , on a Ford Foundation Fellowship , is playwright-in-residence at the Seattle Repertory Theater .

After an argument , they stopped and spoke to a sour-looking man who 'd been typing ; then all three of them came toward him . He stood still and kept his hands down . The city editor was saying , " What difference does it make , damn it ? It 's a good story either way . " He sat on his own desk . " This is Danny Masters . " The old man looked suspicious . " How you feeling , son ? " " I 'm fine , thank you . " " Got a little blood on your nose . You in good health ? " Danny fished out his handkerchief . " My nose bleeds sometimes . " " Who 're your parents , son ? " " I do n't have any .

" Was this your own idea ? Anybody put you up to it ? " " All my own . " The old man shrugged at the city editor . " There 's probably some way we can get sued . " He turned to the sour-faced man who had a pencil behind one ear and a crooked necktie . " What do you think , Sam ? " " Is he advertising something ? " Danny said , " No . " The old man pursed his lips . " They might make you look pretty funny . " " I do n't think so . " Looking steadily at him , the old man said , " And you 'd actually go through with it ? You would n't  --  oh , chicken out ? " " No . " The city editor put his hand on the nearest phone . " I can call Fritz and ask . Give them something to do on a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty good story . ' Police Turn Down Teenage Challenger . ' " After another pause the old man said , " Now do n't get in too much of a rush . " He looked Danny over , then gave a grudging half-smile . " See that green filing cabinet over in the corner ? It 's locked . Let 's see what you can do with it . " Danny looked at their amused faces , at several 104 THE ESCAPE ARTIST others nearby , at a kid his own age gawking from beside the water cooler . He picked up a thin metal ruler from the city editor 's desk and started walking , and if people left enough keys to the city lying around like that , he would n't even have to use his own . Sitting sideways in the front seat , tht reporter said , " How 'd you happen to take this up instead of something else ? " " What 's so strange about it ? " Danny sat deeper in the back seat as the car changed lanes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk . He needed to grope ahead to make sure he had everything figured out right , but his forehead felt stuffed full of other people 's language . " Most young guys want something secuee . Respectable . " " I 'm respectable . " " Sure . " The reporter held his pad of copy paper against the top of the front seat . " Who would you say influenced you most to get into this racket ? " " I knew a locksmith . " " He taught you things , huh ? He still got a license ? " " He 's dead . " " You sure you were n't just practicing case you caught a severe case of reform maybe ? " Danny looked out the window . The reporter said , " Ever tried to bust out of anything before ? " " Yes . " " How 'd it make you feel ? " " Like I wanted to get loose . " He hesitated , seeing the reporter taking notes , but went on anyway . " Then I felt free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , your friends tie you up and like that ? " " Sometimes . " The reporter was keeping a straight face . " You know , the police use real handcuffs and complicated stuff like Cicero corsets . It is n't like getting tied up in an alley or picking Grandma 's dresser drawer . I mean , they are n't using Mickey Mouse locks in the jail anymore . How did you feel the times you could n't get loose ? " " It has n't happened yet . I 'll tell you when it happens . " The reporter glanced at the photographer . " We 've got a live one . " " Uh-huh . " The reporter said , " Every cowboy movie , the crooks hog-tie the good guy and in five minutes he 's loose , so what 's so hard about it ? The crooks walk in and out of jail like it was the men 's john . " " If it 's so easy and boring , how come people are paying to watch ? Because it 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . " So enjoy me . I 'm a good story . " The reporter chuckled flatly , once . " Got anything against cops ? " " They 're always saying No . I like people who say Yes . " Squinting at him as the car turned , the reporter said , " How would you say an escape artist is different from just plain folks , kid ? " " They just dream about it , but he does it . " The photographer said , " What I 'd like to do is pull a disappearing act out of this goddamn silly job . Can you show me how , kid ? " " Yes . " He felt his attention sliding backward into himself like a bolt going into a strike . The policemen crisscrossing importantly from door to door and around corners on both sides of the booking counter seemed in unnaturally sharp focus , outlined so definitely against the cement and plaster they were like targets in a shooting gallery . And no matter how many times Danny blinked , the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter said , " Okay , wait a minute . " He talked to one of the desk sergeants , crowding a man in a ripped undershirt out of the way . People were in trouble all around him : a man in an old sweater sitting on a bench with his head in his hands , dripping blood onto the floor from somewhere on his face ; a kid just out of his teens in black pegged pants standing white-faced with his shoulder against the wall while a policeman smiled at him ; a groggy-looking man with a hump of white bandage plastered over one ear like a seashell . Everybody had broken something or other , a nose , a window , a law , and now they were being shoved into cells to wait for a judge to decide what thing of theirs he could break to get back at them . A Negro with a greasy shopping bag in his lap stared straight ahead , his eyes popping as if he 'd already been hanged . Danny felt his own life locked inside him , keeping as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to break anybody else open and clean out the insides . That was why getting away was important , getting out , getting loose , because they had to make you hold still long enough so they could creek you . The reporter came back and said , " All right , 110 THE ESCAPE ARTIST Fritz is coming but we 're not supposed to make a fuss . No pictures except when he says so . " Checking the battery case on his belt , the photographer said , " Like hell . " " How you doing , kid ? " Danny nodded at the reporter without looking at him , and that was why they were always trying to pin you down to one room , the smaller the better , because they could find you then . could leave you and come back and still find you as if you were a piece of furniture or something in a zoo . A rough-looking , sad-faced man in a rumpled suit came toward them out of one of the side offices and listened to the reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " First of all , is it just a gag ? " The reporter and the photographer answered at the same time , and after a short pause the man said , " Danny Masters . Masters ? ' He seemed to think for a moment , then shook his head . Danny simply waited for them to put him in whatever they considered the worst place . You had to expect a certain amount of confusion . Especially when you were causing it yourself . Fritz nudged him . " So you 're going to make us look sick by busting out of our toy jail here ? Well , we could use a little more bad publicity . " He looked sourly at the photographer . " Do n't blame me , Fritz . I do n't pick my assign-ments . " Touching the reporter on the shoulder , Fritz said , " Ordinarily you know what I 'd tell you to do with an idea like this one ? " " It was n't my baby either , and you must 've said Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I could earn a favor . " And now , apparently , everybody was supposed to go down the hallway because that 's where Fritz was leading the reporter . Instead , Danny paused to look at the tinted photos of policemen killed on duty since the ' twenties , all with level mouths , full faces , and small dark eyes staring into the lens as if into a peephole at somebody fouling up the works , The photographer took his arm . " Let 's get organized . Stall around , and the mayor 'll come downstairs and have his face in it . " The others were waiting at the turn in the corridor , beyond the row of shut office doors on one side and the single small door with a button next to it on the other , and there at the bend the hard part began , the place where they could keep him if he was n't who he thought he was . The floor was absolutely clean , no stains , no cracks , nochips in the wall . He wiped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sign saying No Guns In Jail hung over a row of dead-latched cubicles the size of safety-deposit boxes , and Fritz was locking his pistol in one of them . Beyond him a heavyset turnkey with close-cropped gray hair was holding open the door in the wall of upright bars that separated the cellblock from the station , and Danny had his first glance at the kind of lock he 'd have to handle . He went right on seeing it even after he quit looking at it . Fritz said , " Your boy acts like he was stuffed . What 's the matter ? " The reporter shrugged . " I just work here . " " Maybe I should give him a saliva test . " Fritz smiled and his jowls creased once on each side of his mouth . Then he went past the turnkey , nodding at him , and said , " Come on in . " The reporter followed . As Danny passed through the door he touched the downward-hooked locking dog with his forefinger as if telling it something , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking toward him when he looked back , and the door latched behind them both with a firm collision of iron . The corridor was fifty feet long with two pairs of left-and-right side aisles . Each of the barred cell doors was concave so a man standing in the bulge could see every part of the cell . The locks were the same make as the one on the outer door , the turnkey was carrying only two keys on the ring at his belt , and everything looked possible as long as they did n't get worried about him . The reporter said , " How about the drunk tank ? " " What 's the matter , do n't you like this kid ? " Fritz squeezed Danny 's arm till it hurt . " Want him to lose his virtue ? " The lock cases on some of the cells were painted red , and they stopped at one to look in at three men sitting at a table eating out of plastic bowls . Fritz said , " Hi , sport . " One man held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hi . " " Hello , Captain . " The man had an Ozark twang . " Sir . " Danny kept from meeting the eyes of the men gawking at him from both sides , in every doorway . A man who looked like an Indian wearing blue-and-white striped coveralls came wheeling a covered dinner wagon around a corner and stopped with a clatter when he saw them . The turnkey said , " Go on . " Eyes lowered , the Indian pushed the wagon past them toward the outer door . The smell of stew floated behind . Fritz glanced at the photographer . " Want some ? You can be a one-man delegation from the Amalgamated Judges of Horseflesh . " " No thanks . " The rest of the smells were antiseptic , and the concrete floor had a sheen on it that re-fleeted the caged ceiling lights . Everything , in-eluding the bars and the horizontal spacers across them , was painted a pale green like a schoolroom , and Danny knew it was time to be younger , even scared , Fritz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle than the sides ? By the time a citizen gets back this far , kid , he 's usually in so much trouble , all he can do is shuffle . " He headed into the first side aisle on the left . Danny said , " Looks like a very strong place . " He let a slight quaver get into it . " Very well constructed . " Fritz smiled over his shoulder . " Like it ? " " How many inside at the porter had his pad out , " I do n't know , Sully ? " The turnkey , who " Twenty-eight , sir . " " We try to keep them close together . " Fritz motioned back at the main corridor . " Easier to keep clean . The kid can have a nice quiet place to himself . " He stepped around a waste can with a push broom upside down in it and swung open a cell door with a red lock case . " Want to try this for size ? " The tension in his stomach let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might have taken him all night . It was smaller than any of the others he 'd seen  --  a single iron bunk , a washbowl with push buttons instead of external fixtures , a seat-less john  --  and the ceiling was a foot lower than the others , a single steel plate with two ventilator grids cut directly into it . The photographer said , " Ca n't we use a different one ? I 'll have a hard time keeping the john out of the shots . " Before they could change their minds , Danny stepped inside and bent as if to sit on the bunk . In a harsh voice Fritz said , " Out , a story by David Wagoner kid . " When Danny hesitated , he said , " Out here . We 'll have to take a little look at you before you set up shop . " He came out again and stood still while Fritz got behind him and peeled off the sport coat , fumbling through the pockets before handing it to the turnkey . The flashgun went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny boy ? " Fritz said , " Keep going , kid . I hope you wear a good class of underwear so our friend here wo n't have to airbrush his prints too much . " The reporter said , " I thought you were n't worried , Fritz . What the hell are you going to do , X-ray him ? " " You can say for publication I 'm a brave , confident cop , but I do n't throw myself in the lake just to get a laugh . " Danny took off his shirt and handed it over , seeing his bare chest quiver once like a horse 's flank . His mind was going faster now . He did n't let it show in his face , but he could feel the speed in his fingers . Fritz said , " Shoes . " " He 'll catch cold . " The reporter sounded as if he halfway meant it . " Get your story and shut up . " Danny slipped out of them without stooping , and Fritz shoved them toward the turnkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the push broom , and now he put the shoes at a neat 45-degree angle at the foot of the waste can . The photographer backed down the corridor and the flashgun went off again . Fritz said , " Pants . " Danny let them fall to his ankles and stepped out , shifting sideways far enough to get another look at the outside of the lock . The reporter circled and tried to catch his eye . " Nervous ? Any reactions ? Like to repeat the challenge for the benefit of posterity ? " " You already took it down . " " Yeah , but I did n't get to see Fritz 's face while you were saying it . " Fritz said , " Well at least he came prepared far a little fun : no wallet , no T.D. , no keys , no money . Are n't you guys going to pay him something for earning his Junior Horse 's Ass Merit Badge right . out . in front of you like this ? " " He 's just natural-born show 112 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbling on his pad . " Anything for a little free space . " The flashgun went off again , and Fritz said , Now I 'm going to have to ask you to drop your shorts , kid , like it or not . You do n't have to cough , I just do n't want to miss anything obvious like adhesive tape because if you start sawing away at our nice bars here , it can get expensive . " He kept his eyes straight ahead while he lowered his shorts , feeling his face redden . The flashgun did n't go off . All right , you can keep them on . Turn around . " He pulled up the shorts and faced Fritz . " Open your mouth . Stick out your tongue , Lift it . Show me your teeth . " He did as he was told . The reporter said , " When was the last time you had a jailbreak ? " Ignoring him , Fritz said , " Okay , now the socks . " He waited , then said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny balanced on one foot at a time . The turnkey put the socks inside the shoes , and Fritz said , " In . " " Wait a minute . " The photographer did n't sound quite as bored . " Do n't you have an Oregon boot or some leg-irons or some goddamn chains or something ? If I have to shoot it this way , he looks like he 's on latrine duty in scout camp . " " Leg-irons ? What do you think this is , Russia ? " " At least some handcuffs then , for godsake . " Fritz reached toward his left hip under his coat , then stopped and held out his hand to the turnkey . " Give me yours , Sully . " When the man hesitated , Fritz said , " Well , I do n't want mine scratched up either . " He glanced at Danny who was waiting inside the doorway . " Kid , if you hack these up on the bunk or so much as nick them , you 'll be scrubbing out the drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the pair of glistening Pratt handcuffs go ratcheting into place around his wrists . " Any other hot ideas ? " Fritz looked around . " You want him strung upside down ? " The flashgun went off twice , and then the turnkey was swinging the door shut . It latched with a deep clank . The flat , oval-handled brass bit key went into the lock , turned once , then turned again . Fritz said , " This is what 's called a felon 's cell , double-locked like an old maid 's back door . " " Look noble , kid . " The photographer was crouching near the floor . " You want to gnash your teeth , Fritz ? " " No thanks . " The flashgun went off , and the reporter came over to lean against the bars . " Only one hour ? " Danny nodded . " I 'm just trying to figure out how many cups of coffee we can manage . " Fritz said , " If you want more time , it 's okay by me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it . Let him have two or three lessons . " Trying to look sheepish , Danny said , " One hour . " Then Fritz was helping herd the others down the corridor ; joking through the back talk , but he stopped at the mouth and let the turnkey take the newspapermen out of sight toward the entrance to the block . anny waited at the right edge of the cell door where he could see as far as possible , making no moves . After a moment the turnkey came back into the side corridor alone , spoke briefly to Fritz , then followed him to Danny 's cell again , unlocking it with a double clockwise turn . Fritz said , " Thanks , Sully . Can you see me ? " " No , sir . " " That 's the spirit . " The turnkey went toward the main corridor . Grabbing hold of the central swivel between handcuffs , Fritz pulled Danny through the door . He spoke in a low voice . " Sorry to interrupt your valuable time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His bare feet slid from the cold steel floor of the cell to the equally cold concrete , and gooseflesh traveled up his legs and arms like a shock . Fritz tugged him toward the dead end of the corridor and stopped at the last closed solid cell door on the right . He pushed the cover back from the safety-glass judas window and yanked Danny toward it . " Take a good look . " A young man was sitting on the floor of the otherwise empty padded cell , resting his back against one of the bulging vertical humps of green-painted canvas and looking straight at the window . He had two black eyes , like a burglar wearing a mask in a cartoon , and he had on socks , shorts , and a bloody white shirt . When he smiled , the inside of his mouth looked redder than his lips . In his ear Fritz whispered , " This is an old friend of mine . He tried to bust out of an interrogation room , and unfortunately for him he thought he 'd hit somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things I do n't like in this job , but I do n't mind taking care of characters like this . I want to impress something on your mind , kid . I do n't quite know what you think you 're doing , but I want to show you a bad example just in case . In an hour the boys will take some more pictures of you bawling in your cell with a snotty nose , and they 'll write down your deathless observations on the subject of bragging , and then they 'll forget about you . After that , it wo n't matter what color your eyes are or how many teeth you 've got . " He paused . " You listening ? " " What 's this man charged with ? " Fritz smiled . " Booze , as a rule . And do n't waste my time . I 'm giving you facts . Lot of sick boys around town , and they all wind up here , kid . " The man in the cell got up off the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show his pink teeth . He was talking rapidly , inaudibly . Fritz said . " And they all wind up talking to themselves . What 's your hometown ? " Danny shut his mouth . The window cover fell back into place , cutting off the prisoner in the middle of a series of slow , silent four-letter words . Fritz said , " It 's Iron City , is n't it . " After a few seconds , Danny realized his eyes had n't stayed still enough.a story by David Wagoner 113 " What was your old man 's name ? " " I never had an old man . " He was cold , and he could see his clothes hung over the push broom like a scarecrow , And they liked to make you uncomfortable too ; it was all part of their pleasure to take away any chance you had to be dignified . Like the time in the locker room being painted with Merthiolate or the time the laundry fell off his bike on the playground and everybody danced with it . " Masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him . " Danny kept his eyes on the open door of his cell , waiting for the pressure on the handcuffs to steer him toward it . Fritz hauled him a few steps , then stopped again . " Was Harry Masters your old man ? I remember it was ? " he pushed Danny 's chin aside to look at his profile . " I think I 'll take a run through the files . " He led him the rest of the way to the cell , palmed him inside , then shut the door and looked at Danny through the bars . " You 've got more than one funny idea in your head , do n't you , kid . Country boys get hungry and they start trying to speed everything up . Your pockets get to starving and you start seeing double at the crotch , and the first thing you know , you have to catch up and get ahead and stay ahead and make sure everybody sees you doing it . Then you have to start showing everybody they 're just around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and I 'm telling you he got pushed back so hard it knocked the wind out of him . Permanently . He was behind the times too , kid . He gut to thinking he was a gangster , only there was n't any gang . I 'm not sure what the hell you think you are , but maybe well find out later . " He beckoned down the corridor . " You would n't be thinking about hurting anybody , would you ? " Danny kept his eyes on the wall , and the turnkey came and double-locked the door again . Fritz said , " They did n't shoot him back in here , you know . He got as far as the outside hall , which is pretty good for a country boy at that . " The turnkey said , " They 're raising hell out there ' cause we 're not letting him alone Like he said . I told them I ? " " All right , all right . " The two men started along the corridor , and Fritz looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something real , kid , remember there 's no reporters around for miles . Everybody takes their time over things . " Then they were finally going ! they turned the corner and did n't come back . He waited an against his stomach . The wagon was past the mouth , the Indian was slouched behind it , the turnkey was on the far side facing the bearded man . Danny went to his knees against the warm stainless steel flank of the wagon . The Indian jerked his head in surprise but did n't change expression , and the turnkey said , " I 'll tell you what the word is : quiet . " " What the hell , Sully , it 's after hours upstairs . The mayor and all the big shots are out drinking a little dinner . They ai n't nobody to bother . " " Bothers me. sport . " " Well , you 're a no-account old cop , so what 's the difference ? " A gangling , tired-looking man was leaning against the bars of a cell only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then glanced away embarrassed . He was n't used to having this many people know what he was doing . Being alone was almost as important as knowing how . He looked ahead at the main entrance and the empty hall beyond it . No telling how long it would stay empty . The turnkey said , " Come again ? " Breaking into a loud twang , the bearded man chanted . " You 're a no-account cop , and I 'll sing what I please . If you do n't like ? " A key turned in a lock , and from around the edge of one rubber-rimmed wheel Danny saw the cell door swinging open and feet shuffling in it . The bearded man sang , " If you do n't like my music you can ? " He stopped with a deep grunt . The turnkey said , " All right . " There was a brief scuffle , the feet rearranged themselves , and the door clanged shut again . " You want to do it nice , or you just want to wake up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The bearded man sounded subdued . The feet started to go deeper along the corridor . and Dar ? moved to the front corner of the wagon . He ducked and raised one elbow when he felt the hand touch his back , but it was the Indian motioning him to hold still , the straight blue-black hair hanging down in a cowlick almost over one eye . The bearded man and the turnkey were wrangling and moving further away . The Indian nudged him , and Danny went to the front of the wagon . his cheek against the warm metal . It bumped him like a signal , and when he looked back , using the legs of the Indian 's coveralls as a shield , the corridor was empty . The voices were coming out of the side aisle he 'd just come from , but he did n't wait to worry . He ran for the main entrance.a story by David .

He only needed a little time now , but the eyes of one old man standing in the last cell door on the left stopped him . He had a red face and a mismatched blue suit . Danny 's socks skidded on the concrete as he stopped . He whispered . " Do you want out ? Do you want to come with me ? " The red-faced man looked at the short fat man next to him , looked back into the empty cell , then looked at Danny again . " Who. me ? " " What 're you in for ? " Danny glanced back along the corridor : the turnkey was still out of w sight , and the Indian coming toward him with the wagon . " For living . " " Do you want out or do n't you ? " Not daring to waste any more time , he knelt at the main lock , which was the same type as the others but keyed differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shim momentarily . The red-faced man whispered , " I 'm in on a D and 1 ) , son , I do n't want any trouble , I 'm getting out tomorrow . " Danny began to hunt for the break in the last pin . The Indian was wheeling the wagon close , turning it to block him from sight . The turnkey would have to come running in order to stop him now because he was going , he was going and knew how to go , where , when , and how far , and he was right on top of the process each step of the way , he was the man with the power , and the word kid was n't fitting him anymore . that key would n't even go into the lock . The follower split the last pin , and he started to turn the plug with the tongue of one handcuff . From up the corridor the turnkey said , " What 're you waiting there for ? " The Indian said , " Who ? " " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to . " The Indian 's voice was deep , sullen , and stupid-sounding . He came around on Danny 's side of the wagon and leaned on it . " Who did n't want to what , for chrissakes ? " Danny hit the side of the wagon three loud blows with the handcuffs down near one of the Indian 's feet , and the man jerked with surprise , looking down . The turnkey shouted , " You kick any more city property , Redskin , I 'll ? " In a loud hollow high voice like some kind of hound dog , a man 120 THE ESCAPE ARTIST started singing in the distance , using the same tune the bearded man had used but even further off-key . Danny put on his shoes and got ready . Joining in , the bearded man 's deeper voice came out of the side aisle , and it was impossible to understand either one of them . The Indian said , " Now . " D anny unlatched the door , held it open politely , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducked through , squeezed it shut , then ratcheted the handcuffs tight from the last bar in the door to the first bar past the jamb , shoved the follower into the keyways of the cuffs , and broke off a fragment in each . He took five quick steps to the turn in the corridor and , while peeking around it down the long hall to the brighter area of the booking counter . which was nearly deserted , he listened to the growing commotion behind him . It was n't loud yet , but some kind of alarm was liable to gn off at any second . Standing erect , he stamped the clean place on the floor once , and there was n't going to be any shooting , nobody floundering around on the shiny disinfected concrete trying to spit blood as fast as it was coming , because there was another way if you could learn it , teach your hands how to do things for themselves , including things nobody else could do or even think of . so in spite of the fact that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out how to congratulate yourself , pat yourself on the back , give yourself a break , and forgive yourself for being wrong . He began walking purposefully to the small door with the button beside it , not caring who happened to glance his way from the booking area because Fritz had made this a piece of private enterprise . Nobody else had any reason to worry about a " kid , " and using the six-inch alcove of the door as much as possible , he could stay out of sight of the men behind the counter . The ones in front of it would n't holler at him . And it was no use trying any of the side rooms because the windows were bound to have protective screens bolted over them . The door was locked . of course . and he flattened himself in the slight alcove , unlatched his right shoe-sole while the alarm bell went off in the cell block , and took out the flat playing-cardsized picking gun . He put its thin arm into the keyway , used one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger . On the seventh snap , the plug turned in the core , and he was inside somewhere-or-other in the dark with the door shut behind him in time to breathe twice before he heard the feet passing in a hurry toward the cells . The reporter was asking muffled questions and sounded happy . He felt around the yard-square area in front of the elevator , found but did n't use a light switch , then slid the brass cage door far enough aside to let himself in . All elevators made some racket , and after finding the control panel he waited a moment to let things develop in the cell block  --  the turnkey trying to open his own handcuffs , maybe , or Fritz trying to find which of the cells Danny was hiding in , or the man with the black eyes getting ready to pose for pictures and answer funny questions , and everybody having a good time except Fritz . He flipped the snap switch below the buttons and turned on the overhead light long enough to punch number two . The cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and he could feel the cage growing longer from corner to opposite corner in the dark , disappearing up the magician 's sleeve , but the canary was n't going to get killed or even rumpled if he could help it . The only problem would be dodging a watchman or floor mopper in some distant wing of the building while he chose a window with enough shrubbery under it . From here on , whatever he did would never have been done before , not in the whole history of fathers . liarper 's Magazine , May 1965
