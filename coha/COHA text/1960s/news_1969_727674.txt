txt The Federal Communications Commission declared today that national television coverage of the Democratic National Convention of 1968 in Chicago had given a " reasonable opportunity for presentation of contrasting viewpoints " on controversial issues there . The agency thus cleared the three national networks on the general issue of " fairness , " or offering time to both sides on such questions as the war in Vietnam and the civil disturbances in the convention city . Quality Not Judged The commission withheld judgment , however , as to whether the networks had distorted some news at Chicago by filming " staged " incidents . It said it was continuing its investigation in this area and asked for more details from the broadcasters . In a letter to the three networks , the commission emphasized that its decision on the fairness question did not involve any judgment of the quality of convention coverage or any assessment of whether television had presented " the // truth " on various events it showed . The commissioners said they considered the " truth " about news events important but that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency would be " inconsistent with our concept of a free press . " " The Government would then be determining what is the ' truth ' in each news situation ? what actually occurred and ' whether the licensee deviated too substantially from that " truth , " the F.C.C. declared . " We do not sit as a review body of the ' truth ' concerning news events . " Rumor-Spreading Rejected Following this principle , it rejected complaints such as those that the networks spent too much time on the convention floor at the expense of the rostrum or helped " spread rumors " that a movement was under way to draft Senator Edward M. Kennedy for the Presidential nomination . Oil the issue of fairness , the commission concluded from evidence submitted by the networks that they had presented evidence of provocation of the police by demonstrators and had given Mayor Richard J. Daley an opportunity to state the case for the Chicago police force . The commission said it was still investigating four alleged examples of " staged " incidents . These involved : QA " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to National Guard troops and shouted " Do n't hit me ! " when a filming crew gave her a cue . gA . fire set by " what appeared to be a ripwsman " into which he put a " Welcome to Chicago " sign , which cameramen then photographed as it burned . 41lA camera crew that apparently asked a young man in Grant Park to hold a bandage to his head while they shot film , although he had no visible injury . qFilming in Lincoln Park of a young man lying on the ground , being aided by girls in " white medical smocks ; " he later got up and talked to the crew without apparent injury . The last two episodes allegedly involved crews of the Columbia Broadcasting System , so identified by , witnesses . No network was identified in the commission 's description of the first two . In its letter , the agency required all three networks to submit detailed reports of the four allegedly " staged " episodes by March 30 . Both the National ' Broadcasting System and Columbia Broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission of the agency 's requiring them to produce these " comments " in response to charges of unfairness . Complaints Questioned The C.B.S . reply said the network was " particularly concerned when the complaints to which comment is especially invited are complaints that a licensee has given insufficient attention to views of statements of Government officials or has displayed bias against the policies of the national Government . " In making a similar protest , N.B.C . declared : " Few specters can be more frightening to a person concerned with the vitality of a free press than the vision a television cameraman turning his camera to one aspect of a public event rather than another because of concern that a Government agency might want him to do so , or for fear of Government sanction if he did not . " The commission called these " puzzling assertions , " adding : " We have made clear , in decision after decision , the right of broadcasters to be as outspoken as they wish , and that allowance must be made for honest mistakes on their part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
