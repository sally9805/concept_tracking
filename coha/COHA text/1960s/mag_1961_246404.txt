All week , the reports from U.S. intelligence sources were ominous . East-West tensions had reached the snapping point . The Soviet Union was mobilizing . An air strike against the U.S. and Canada was imminent . Then , on Saturday morning , came confirmation from North American Air Defense Command radar-loaded aircraft patrolling the Pacific near Midway : enemy planes were U.S.-bound . <P> These reports were phony . They had been planted as an elaborate preparatory touch to the biggest air-defense exercise in history-Sky Shield II . When Sky Shield II actually started last weekend , all commercial and private flying over the U.S. and Canada ceased for twelve hours , from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m . C.S.T. , and some 2,100 commercial flights were canceled . <P> Yet North American skies were far from empty . Aloft were 1,800 NORAD fighter planes , from long-ranging F-101s to speedy new F-106s on some 6,000 intercept sorties . On the radarscopes of distant destroyers and aircraft , of early-warning stations from the Canadian Arctic and Alaska to towers planted deep in Atlantic waters , appeared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 Strategic Air Command B-478 , B-528 and refueling tankers , along with Vulcan bombers of Britain 's Royal Air Force . Many of these planes were homebound from foreign bases ; others had slipped from their North American stations to turn around over the Pacific and Atlantic and simulate an enemy strike . <P> Some droned 30,000 ft. above Eastern population centers on fake bomb runs . Some roared in just 500 ft. above coastal waters . All radiated spurious electronic signals to confuse defense radar . In Colorado Springs , NORAD 's commander , General Laurence S. Kuter , 56 , sat in front of a giant battle screen in a windowless building , directing the simulated interceptor action that was taking place over 14 million square miles . <P> The obvious difference between Sky Shield II and the real thing was that no bombs exploded , no antiaircraft missiles were launched , no guns were fired . But there was another difference ; it would take days and weeks of study to assess the effectiveness of NORAD 's response to the make-believe attack . If that attack had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be all too apparent all too soon .
