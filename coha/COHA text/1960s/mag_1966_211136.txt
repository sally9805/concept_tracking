Ever since 1949 , when X rays from the sun were first detected , astronomers have been probing the skies for other X-ray sources outside the solar system . Their search was not rewarded until 1962 , when more sensitive instruments picked up the first X-ray emissions from outside the solar system . But until this year , only one additional visible object had been definitely identified as an X-ray producer : the familiar Crab Nebula. * Though their relatively crude instruments sensed X rays from about two dozen other vaguely defined areas of the sky , astronomers have been un able to tell which , if any , of the known celestial bodies were producing them . Now X-ray astronomy seems to be coming of age . The strongest X-ray source has been located and identified as a visible object , a previously photographed but seemingly insignificant blue star in the constellation Scorpio . <P> In order to pinpoint the source of the mysterious Scorpio X rays , a group of scientists led by Physicist Riccardo Giacconi , of Cambridge 's American Science &; Engineering , Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth-well above the atmospheric blanket that X rays can not penetrate . <P> In the rocket 's nose was a complex instrument package designed by Physicist Herbert Gursky and containing a sensitive X-ray scanner and a small camera pointed at Scorpio for 55 sec. of the brief ballistic flight . By measuring the changing intensity of X rays detected by the scanner and coordinating the scanner with the camera , Giacconi 's group was able to locate Scorpio 's X-ray source about 1,000 times as accurately as any previous studies . They also determined the angular size of the radiating object itself , and concluded that the X-ray source would probably appear as a bluish , starlike object of the 13th magnitude ( visible with a 6-in. telescope ) . <P> Infant Star . Armed with this information , observers at the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory and California 's Mount Palomar Observatory focused their large telescopes on the proper position in the sky . Immediately they spotted their quarry : a blue , starlike object with a magnitude of 12.6 . " It was really Giacconi 's show all the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Identification was terribly easy after he provided the precise location . " <P> The newly identified object , designated ScoX-1 by astronomers , is in the Milky Way Galaxy ; it is between 300 and 3,000 light-years from the earth , and could be about 100 million miles in diameter . Though it has some of the spectral characteristics of a nova , a star that suddenly flares up , the X-ray-emitting envelope of gas surrounding it is apparently not expanding . This leads Giacconi to speculate that ScoX-1 may be a cloud of gas condensing into an infant star , or an existing stellar system surrounded by a gas cloud . " Or , " he says , " we may be looking at an entirely new type of celestial object .
