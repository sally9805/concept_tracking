hot soapy water are poured to the concrete floor . To avoid getting wet I jump to the wooden platform behind the empty serving trays of the main counter . Someone laughs . To the left of me the three doors of a dishwasher clang open and the hot steam billows out . The tray filled with purified pieces of tin is pulled out with a long metal hook and slammed along a wet tin table . Other hands catch the tray and quickly pick out and stack the cups and spoons and then carry the tray around the washer and give it to a third pair of hands which fills it up again . Walking out the kitchen 's back door I pass other pairs of hands slowly peeling the hundreds of potatoes for tomorrow 's meals . These are the vegetable-like men sitting on their wooden boxes , peeling vegetables as they have done for years . Their faces are as empty of feeling as their hands . Fat , yellow , and disgusting with leaking eyes and mouths and noses . I could kick them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue peeling peeling peeling . In the shower across from our room I take off my clothes , turn on the water , and wait for it to get warm . I now feel a part of the hospital and not just a lowly inmate . I work in the kitchen . My new job has given me more courage than I usually have . I step out to the tiled floor in front of the sinks and mirrors . I can stand the stink of food on me a little longer . In back of me a toilet flushes . So what . I have nothing to fear . Let himp21see me . To the right of me a blurred figure passes the open door . So what . I look in one of the mirrors . The boy in the reflection is pink , dirty , a little skinny , younger than anything in the world . Stupid brown hair hangs just above blue eyes with lashes that are too long . The shoulders are bony , the arms long , too long I think and damnit there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , always has been . The belly is beautifulcompared with the fat wrinkled gut one usually sees in a shower room . The dark hair just recently noticed surrounds a dick that must surely be the smallest in the world . It shamefullypeers between two long and I have to admit , beloved legs . Beneath them of course , which I ca n't see in the mirror , are those two ugly things : feet . I do n't look at them . I turn around and glance over my shoulder like a ballerina at the backside of the one I love . Nothing wrong there . Nicely formed . I turn my head up a little . My hand brushes my hair over one eye so that I look in the mirror like a naked pretty girl . Suddenly a clothed one does appear in the doorway . It is nurse Jenkins . Timmy , what the hell are you doing . I run back to the shower and scrub . Once out of the shower I dress again in the dirty clothes and walk barefoot to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways and then zoom across the hall to our room and close the door . The light is off . Out of the sudden darkness the moans of my only friend are not stopped by the pillow I knowp22he holds over his face . I undress quietly and dump the clothes to the floor rather than bring on the squeaks our wardrobe makes when being opened . Without opening a drawer to look for clean underwear I climb naked between the cold sheets and warm covers and wish to God he 'd stop moaning . After a while I hear the clicks of the hall lights going out . The left-over light beneath the door is now as black as everything else . A minute later , maybe two or three , the light of the moon filters through the blinds and I begin to see everything in blurred lumps . I hear the jangle of keys down the hall , the footsteps of a prowlingattendant , the far scream of a woman who hears something she should n't . I play with myself , thinking of some long-ago fifth-grade girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn over on my side and try to go to sleep . I 'm used to the moans by now of course , but I think of how lucky I am to work in the kitchen . I think of that for a while and then I feel a slight draft on my back . I roll over on the cold spot . I play with myself again thinking of that fifth grader 's bare knees hanging from an iron bar , her dress almost touching the ground upside down , her panties of whatever the hell color they were . Would n't you think I 'd remember a thing like that . Her pink belly button that looked like one of the eyes on her doll . Her smooth " turn " as she called it . They way she fell to the ground and accused me of looking at her . Why of course I did . The way she did it again but trying vainly this time to cover dirty knees that I did n't want to see anyway.  |p23The  way she disappeared all of a sudden through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cobwebbedwindow as I was beginning to walk home filled all ready with memory treasures , and put her lips to the glass for me to come , oh so coldly close to . The way she ... . Please stop moaning , Chuck . Please . I get out of bed . Damn it 's getting cold . I kneel down by his bed . I put my hand on his chest . Chuck , is there anything I can do . No , no , yes , get me a glass of water , he says . I get up and find his glass and open the door and peek out into the darkness . Damn it 's cold . I run to the bathroom . Two men are in the shadows at the far end by the shower . One is kneeling by the other . I go to the first sink and run the water . I feel their eyes on me . The courage of my new job is long gone . I fill the glass and get out of there fast . I cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks . I kneel down again . Chuck , I say . Is there anything else I can do for you . My head hurts , Timmy . It hurts so much . Please go back to bed . I 'll try not to keep you awake . Oh Chuck , Chuck , I say . And there it ends . What does one say when there is nothing to say . How can I tell him that he does n't bother me even though he does . Oh God , how can I. . . My sheets seem even colder than they were before . I wake up in the morning and look at the feet of my friendp24Chuck . Beyond them is a covered body and beyond that is a head with wide-awake . . . . I get out of bed and take a disinfectedT shirt and pair of shorts from the top drawer of the dresser and a pair of gray-and-white institution socks from the second drawer which is his . I put them on in a hurry and run across the hall to wait in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb into the blue dungarees and green shirt I 've been wearing for the past month . Chuck is sitting up . Good morning , Timmy , he says . Good morning , Chuck . How do you feel today . My head hurts a little but not too much . Maybe I 'm getting better . I sure hope so , I say going to the window . Is it still raining , he says . No . The sun is shining and it 's a beautiful day , I say . I turn to watch as he throws off the covers and puts his feet on the floor and I 'm glad he can do it without help . I hope we do n't have cereal and prunes again , I say , handinghim his clothes from the dresser . Well , at least there 's a lot of it . I was in a place once where we only got coffee and raisin bread in the morning . That 's not much worse than here , I say . Yes it is . You should be happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever someone actually found a raisin we 'd put it into a jar we had hidden in a hole in the wall . What for , I say.  |p25That  jar was also filled with all the cough medicine and hair tonic and orange peels we could beg or steal from the other inmates . In time it would sort of ferment and once a month we 'd take it out and three or four of us would get high . It must have tasted terrible , I say . And it never did help my headaches either . We go outside and join the breakfast line . The sun is warm and the white ducks are floating and feeding far from any of their bridges . I wonder why they 're so brave today , I think to myself . I wish I could be a little braver about things . How did you feel when you came here the first day , Chuck says as we follow the others to building L and the main dining room . When they first told me I was coming to a hospital I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything because I knew what they really meant . I remember they did n't say goodbye and I remember the car ride a little , especially the bars , but almost nothing else . It was at night when they put me in that big room with all those nuts that I started to get scared . But I 'm glad I did n't scream or anything or else they might not have put me in with you . They would 've locked you away in one of those violent wards , he says , pointing to building K. They always watch us closely that first week to see where we belong . After that they forget all about us . I sure wish they 'd remember long enough to send me back home , I say . P26They will , he says . But I 've only seen a doctor once in the month I 've been here , I say . He gave me some ink-blot tests and asked me some silly questions and told me I had my own social worker who I could see any time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hear it . I remember again the ink blots . That one there is two mice , I once said . And what are they doing , the doctor said . They 're staring at each other . They hate each other . They want to kill each other . But why , Timmy . Why do they hate each other . Because they know each other . Because they 're friends . They 're married . But why do they hate each other if they 're so close . That big blot in between , I said . That 's their son . So what did the social worker tell you , Chuck asks again . Nothing , I say . The doctor never told me who she was or where I could find her . He just wished me good luck and said goodbye . Timmy , Chuck says as we go up the steps to the dining room . What , I say . Timmy , he says again as we pick up our trays and go past the serving tables to get our cereal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head is starting to hurt bad again.  |p27I  'm sorry , I say . So now I 'm alone again , I think to myself . He talks to me so seldom . Before we come to the end of the table I see the same server who hired me for kitchen duty yesterday . I smile at him and he looks at me as if I were crazy . Why were n't you here to help set up the breakfast carts , he says . I 'm sorry , no one told me , I say . I want you here an hour before every meal and not just supper . Yes sir , I say . How would you like to help deliver the food carts to some of the buildings , he says . Would I , oh boy , I think to myself . How much does it pay , I say . It does n't pay anything , he says . It gives you something to do . Great , I say . When do I start . He slops me an extra several spoonfuls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him as if he were crazy . Come an hour early for lunch , he says . Thank you , I say , and go to the next guy who gives me two bowls of prunes instead of the usual one . My second day on the job and I 'm promoted already , I tell Chuck as soon as we 've found a table . He smiles and says , can I have some of those prunes.  |p28An  hour before lunch I throw the last of my bread to the white ducks and go to the kitchen . On the large stove blackened by thousands of meals there are cauldrons of boiling soup , stew , more prunes I think , potatoes , coffee , and other things which smell funny . With a long ladle I dip into the stew and fill the deepest containers of each of five carts , cover them tight , and roll them to another server who slops the rest of the meal into the other containers . We line each ready cart at the door that leads to the tunnel which leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men to show the way I push my cart down the steep ramp to the tunnel . We rumble past the entrance to the alcoholic ward , past the Sweet Shoppe , under what I think is the main gate , past the ramp to my own building , and along a narrow stretch of tunnelto the entrance of building H.Halfway up the ramp the cart stops . Some soup splashes to the cement . It 's too steep for me . The man helps me push it up the rest of the way . This is your building , huh kid , he says . No , I say . Mine was back there . Well this is where you kids stay ai n't it , he says . Yes , I say . This is where we stay . It 's the boys ' building where the twelve- to eighteen-yearoldsstay . I wish now I 'd never taken this stupid job . I hope no one sees me . But that 's silly . I 've come here to feed them haven'tp29I . Of course they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this over with fast . You 're lucky , the man says as we come to a room filled with ping-pong tables , bats , baseballs , gloves , stacks of comic books , and even an art easel with lots of paper and chalk and in one corner there 's a long black telescope that stands on three legs and stares out of a window which , imagine that , it does n't even have bars or iron mesh or anything . You 're lucky you work in the kitchen and do n't have to stay inside for a whole week , he says . Are you one of the brats who broke all those windows in the girls ' building . No , I say . I 'm not one of them . We come to a bathroom and I look in . There are doors on the toilets and the ceiling is not protected by a wire basket . We come to the office and stop . Two kids my age are inside sitting on stuffed chairs with their feet on the desk as they listen to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gray suit comes out and takes us down a newly painted hallway . The two boys follow . Okay , he yells . Lunch time . Hurry up . The two boys stand by the cart and stare at me . All around us thick wooden doors with jagged cavities where locks should be are opened by the other punished boys and as they line up for me to serve I look in one room . There is a double bunk with a mattress and sheets and a pile of neatly folded covers at the foot of only the bottom one . The light blue walls are lined with the cutout pictures of girls , sport cars , the latest Grumman jets , and a carefully framed page-length ad for a bottle of gin . Onep30homemade table with a chair by the barless window has on it a tin-foil ashtray , three empty soda bottles , and a stack of books , real books . C'm on , let 's go kid . Start dishing the shit out , one pimpled teenager says , thrusting his tray in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some dopey in back of him shouts . Hey look at the kid who 's too good to live with us , a third says . Hey stupid , shouts a fourth . What are you in for . Did you diddle your mother . All those damn boys laugh . Every single one . I feel more embarrassed than I can ever remember . All right , their attendant says . Knock it off . That 's enough . C'm on you two , he says to us . Let 's get these punks fed so 's I can get back to my wife . Everyone laughs again , even the man I 'm with . But I do n't . I feel my head turning as red as one of those beet-like things I 'm serving . I 'm so scared and ashamed my mind dulls . I stare at the stuff I 'm slopping out to each boy but I do n't think of anything at all except that I wish they would stop staring at me . Only when I 'm taking the empty cart down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me says , I thought you said you lived with them , how come you do n't , you do n't seem to me to be more than thirteen or fourteen , how come huh , do my thoughts come back and I 'm surprised I do n't cry . In the kitchen I serve two slices of bread to everybody on the line and wash a few carts and then eat . Later , back in myp31own building Chuck asks me how it went . I tell him it went fine . I delivered to the kids in building H. Why are n't you there instead of here . I do n't know , I say . But I 'm glad I 'm not . Why in the world would you rather be here with a sick guy like me than over there with kids your own age , he says . Because I do n't like school , I say . Oh , he says . That makes sense . Because I do n't like baseball and comic books , I think to myself . BecauseI do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopes and toilets with doors on them . Because . . . . and then I think a tear or two may be coming and although I 've seen him cry many times he has never seen or even heard me cry and to keep it that way I casually run like hell to the shower and bawl . An hour before supper I am in the kitchen again . I tell the boss , please sir , I ca n't go to building H any more . I 've had a fight with one of the boys there and I 'm afraid if I see him again I might dump a whole ladle of hot soup on his head . He looks at me in the way he would look at a pot that had n't yet boiled and says , that would be a waste of the state 's money . But you do n't have to worry . Tonight you 're going to the girls ' building . Now get to filling up those carts with pudding . Use the square container in the middle and try not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes sir . Thankyou sir . I go over to the stove . If it 's almost impossible to eat one bowl of this smelly stuff , how can I ladle out hundreds . But Ip32do , because as the guy said , it gives me something to do . The tunnel to the girls ' building is a long one . Since they have their own yard to play and walk around in and since it 's been a long time since I 've seen a pretty face I look forward with each step to being surrounded by dozens . After many other entrances have been passed their locked door is finally reached and unlocked by a fat and smelly matron dressed in white . Through the door which is carefully locked behind us and up a steep ramp and along a hallway that stares with thick portholeddoors we push our sloshing machine until a voice like the crack of a whip winds around our feet and hands and makes us stop . Stay right there you two . Now , a growing din of giggles adds to her second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ea  --  ting  --  time , she yells . Doors fly open and pajama-wearing girls of all ages , colors , and sizes flow out in a giggling tidal wave to engulf the space before our cart in three straight lines as if they were the members of a fast dancing act . The lead girls , seeing me , stop their chatter and stare for a few seconds before the third command sounds . Shut up  --  Eat . The girls quickly get their trays and one by one they pass by and take my servings of chopped hot dogs and boiled potatoesand then the man 's pudding and cookies and half-pints of milk or maybe a cup of coffee instead please.  |p33The  first girl looks at the hot dogs I give her and says , oh dear , they 're cut up again . The one behind her who is almost as ugly as the first , points her chewed finger at me and says , do n't worry honey , who needs them when we can have him . I do n't get the joke but several others laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matron behind me . Three more girls prance up . They ca n't be more than ten or eleven years old . Their white pajamas are much too big for them . They look like rabbits that have been snowed upon all winter . I try to give them an extra half-pint of milk . A grip of steel on my arm from behind changes my mind . One winks at me anyway . I wink back . The sixth girl walks to the cart , her swollen belly pushing the cart 's handle into my own . She wears brown pajamas with ragged cuffs and looks like the pregnant bitch the kids on my block used to throw rocks at . She grunts as she passes me . The seventh girl is fat and dumpy . She smells even worse than the food I give her . After her come more and more and more , some are smelly , some perfumed , some are black or big or skinny , smiling , terrified , pregnant , lovely , or slow . All are here and wished they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pink and blessed by little red roses . She has dark yellow hair which is fixed with a rubber band in a pony tail that hangs around and down one shoulder . She has blue eyes which stare at me as if she 'd never seen a boy before . She has other things too but I do n't know what they are . She touches my fingers when I put some pota/toes on her tray and she pulls back and smiles an apology , and unlike most of the others I see that she has pink lips and cheeks like a boy 's . As she passes her blue slippers make scuffing sounds on the tile . The next girl is pretty too but a few years older than either of us . She touches one of her hands hard between my legs and says , the girl you were staring at was Cindy . My name is Janice and I hope you 'll come back when the matron is n't here so we can get together . Yes , I whisper and then that lovely girl follows Cindy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of the slop to the last more in love with life than ever before . Neither of the two adults had seen anything as adults never do . In the tunnel again , pushing our empty carts , the man says , some of those girls were pretty ugly were n't they . Yes , I say . Some were . In the kitchen I fill a cavity on the serving table to hand out bread to the line of stragglers . Chuck is among the last . His face looks almost as white as the extra slices I hand him . Thankyou , Timmy , he says to someone behind me . An hour or so later I finish my meal and go back to my building and take a long shower . Our room is already dark and Chuck is in bed . Thank God he 's not moaning tonight . Ip35quietly close the door , put my clothes on the floor , brush off my feet , and climb into bed . Our window is not quite dark yet and outside our door the lights are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't know and do n't want to know are still walking around and chattering about home or tobacco or baseball scores or the injustice of it all or other important things . Someone screams from a nearby building but the men keep chattering . There 's another scream from a farther building , and at first I think , that 's an owl in response to the first , but then I remember where I am and that the two ca n't reach each other and thank heavens they ca n't . Strange , how I ca n't tell if they 're men owls or women owls . If I thought for a second it was that pretty girl in the pink pajamas I would jump up and put on my clothes and run to her building and knock down that big hunk of matron and steal her keys and rush to her room and say , I 'm here , I love you , do n't worry . Or something like that . But no , I guess I would n't . Because I 'm not that brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not really here anyway . I do n't know where I am . That poor girl . I wonder what 's wrong with her . I wonder what 's wrong with me . And I wonder why things are like they are . With pain and unhappiness and all that . I guess if some did n't hurt then others would n't feel good . P36My stay becomes worse as the weeks slip into the past . Chuck does n't sleep any more so neither do I. Even if I fall asleep duringa meal either his moans wake me or else his asking for some of that there egg I 'm not eating does , and when I jump he asks me what 's wrong and I say , nothing , and push my tray over and go back to work . Everybody is complaining about the food . It 's becoming even nastier because someone wants to save money for more shock machines , newer straitjackets , and other better things . At least that 's what they tell me . In the back hallway of the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes , beans , and other things all morning long . Last week we were supposed to get an electric bean snipper and also a newer and bigger potato peeler to replace the rumblingrusty one we have . We did n't get either because someone decided that it 's good for the vegetables to have something to do . I 'm sure they think so too . My stay becomes worse because Chuck does n't let me sleep , because the food is so bad , because there 's never anything to do between meals , because even though I 've almost forgotten home I want even more to go back . Because I 'm so bored and lonely and unhappy and surrounded by disinfectant that sometimes I just do n't want to live any more . Even though Chuck 's pain is worse I can no longer use it as an excuse for beingP37happy . Even though he almost never complains I 'm bored with his pain and I 'm bored with him . At fourteen I feel closer to death than I did at twelve . During that summer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an aunt . After four months of hate I was adopted by people . I hated them too at first , then loved them for a while until like all the others before them they decided I did n't belong . The one time I saw the doctor he called me a shuttlebug . Time does n't heal . It opens old wounds and starts new ones . Each one took a hand , a foot , or a piece of one year and forgot to give it back . The real hard thing is they never say goodbye , not ever ; they just go . But there are nice things too , then and now . The fat woman who once smothered me in the perfume of her breasts . Some man who used to kiss my goodnight cheek and say I 'd stay forever . An older daughter of one family , I do n't remember their names , who yelled at me many times , fed me once from a tray when I was sick with the measles or the mumps , saw me once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of now , I do like some of the excitement of all these people running around like nuts . I like the way the shadow on the red wall of building F turns to gray and creeps to the tree that shadows third base in the ball field and then turns the whole world black . I like the way the whirls of wind play with the sand of the empty field . I like the way the leaves float as if held by spider webs , and sometimes they are . I like the way the sky becomes white and then gray and then wet . Ip38like the way the rain sprinkles me as if to prepare me for the shower that will come if I do n't go inside . I like the thoughts that float in and out even before I can think of them ; like all the plans that people use to change the world , they end as soon as they begin . I like little things like pocket dust , white duck feathers , or any others I can find , flying things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting things , my body , my hands , my face but not my ears , my wavy brown hair , my nose a little , the way my eyes see circles of light in the darkness if I roll them fast enough , and the downfloatinglines and half-circles they see on a blue sky . I do n't like my feet very much . I do n't like the noise and the smell and the tension of bathroomsand bedrooms and cleaning closets . I do n't like the hairy morning legs of the old men who shuffle past not knowingwhere they 're going , or the attendants not caring if they know or not . Some of them seem dead and others secure . It was only once I really wished for death . It was during that car ride . That was also the only time I felt strangely secure as if the bars that kept me from the drivers were there for my protection in the way a dream lets a mind go crazy when no one can see or in the way that waking up protects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived it was quite horrible . After a time the shock went away . Oh Lord , I 'm so bored . They make me work harder and for longer hours and I 'm very much bored with that too . I know I could quit any time I want but then I would n't have anythingp39to do at all . It seems to me I 've been bored all my life . It seems that ever since I was born my life has been grinding to a boring halt and now is the time to wait for death . What is death anywaybut having nothing to do and no one to talk to . No one likes me except Chuck and he almost never talks to me . But then no one ever did . There 're not many robins on the lawn . Some day I 'll see one and I 'll know that he 's the last one and like every year I 'll say to myself , I 'm just like you , nobody wants me to come with them either . Sometimes I think that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to break the boredom and I see dead people who are still alive I stop feeling sorry for myself . I do n't welcome these breaks but neither do I run and hide from them as I would 've when I first arrived . Once I delivered to one of the violent wards in building K.Usually I deliver to the dead people who are dead in the quiet smelly alphabet buildings of E , F , and G. On these wards the dummies , the vegetables , and the disturbed exist on rows of benches for years just staring across the cement floor to other benches of other humans who stare back . Sometimes I think that this is the way we want them . Sitting , rotting , not causing any trouble , out of the way , nice simple nuts who do n't eat too much and who dirty only the rubber sheets that are easily washed . They do n't cost much either , Chuck told me . Only pennies for the electricity of shock , and the lobotomies are alwayspaid for by visiting medical students who go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking it funny itp40had n't . Many times in my life I 've heard of such dead people and I 've thought they were very funny . I guess even war or murderor an earthquake is funny when you 're not involved . But when you are involved ; when the only thing real is a food cart , a half-wit server , two attendants who are only different from their patients because they are cleaner , younger , and more alive , when you 're so close to the unreal things that they becomeright , when you 're so close to them that the shit on their fingers comes off on yours when they take away the dented cup , when they stand , these weak slobbering bastards with their shaved heads and sunken unshaved cheeks and wet hairy noses that touch pointy chins , when you smell a talcum-powder baby smell and you ask yourself , what caused me not to be like this or my teachers in school or the people who put me here , when rows of gray-suited things stand and line up in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know how to do , when they sit again and dig in with fingers and get it all over the place as if it were n't something to eat at all but instead a pile of sand in a playpen or a formula for an atom bomb or just some gook that somehow has for the moment gotten in the way of life and made them think . . . . it is not funny . Do I hate them . Yes I do . Do I feel sorry for them . Not really . They 've escaped . Sometimes I think this is the way we want them . Except for the stink and the wet babbling I do n't mind them too much . But once I delivered to one of the violent wards in K building and never will again . Two days ago I went with my usual stupid companion with a breakfast cart that con/tained all the leavings the other wards had n't used . We rumbledthrough the tunnel for a long time before stopping at the locked gate of an elevator . We waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food got cold . Finally someone answered our constant ringing of the bell by coming down in the elevator and unlocking the gate so we could push through and into the car . The trip up was slow and so shaky that some soup splashed to the floor several times . When I looked up at the attendant who was operating the control handle he smiled at me and as if to show off , pulled the handle back and forth so that the poor car shuddered to a stop , shook to a start , stopped started and finally at the fourth floor gave up gladly . Sloshing through the soupy floor we passed the grinning attendant and entered a thick wire cage . Even before the attendant had locked the elevatordoor and unlocked the cage I saw and heard and smelled all around me a nightmare . Another attendant , an old stoopedoverman , got up from a desk and welcomed us into a room that seemed much too small somehow to contain the desk and chair , the table with the piles of magazines and the expensivelookingblue radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where three naked men stood with their heads slightly bent because of the sharp wires above them . I was pushed toward the first cage and told to feed him . I did . The thing I fed seemed even more bald and barefoot all over than the others . His ears and nose were so tiny they almost were n't there . His forehead was all wrinkled up . His eyes stared out of deep shadows and his mouth frowned from another . His facep42looked like the underside of a clenched fist that had a thumb missing . He grunted and took the bowl and poured it slowly on his face with one hand using the other to scoop off the drippingsfrom chest and stomach and legs . As soon as it went in it seemed to come back out . At the back of his heels a brown puddle appeared . He licked at his chest and arms and grunted a few times and then he did the craziest thing of all . He looked right at me and said , thankyou . I went to the next cage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing here was old and skinny . He seemed to be made out of a pile of wrinkled sticks . He was sitting on three of them . Two were his feet and the third was a dark red mass of flesh somewhat like the behind of a baboon I had once seen in a zoo . He did n't take his bowl but instead began to scoot all over the cement floor on that red mass pushing and pulling with his feet and hands and squealing with laughter at each turn . Echoes in different voices cried and giggled from far behind the closed door that waited next to the third cage . Do n't worry about him , the grinning attendant said . Sometimesif he runs around enough his ass begins to look like a peeled tomato . We went to the third cage . The old attendant poked me in the ribs and said , what do you think of this mess . I stared at the hairy shit-covered animal who had his hands waiting on the metal shelf and he stared back as if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p43Hey  kid , hey , I 'm talking to you , the old attendant said . I looked at him and he was getting red in the face from anger because I had n't answered . My lips started to move but nothing could come out . Something inside me seemed to say that there was n't anything to say but I could still think though just barely and I thought , my God , I did n't want this . How could anybody . And still my lips moved and his face got redder and redder . Hey , hey , he said in a loud voice . Now , Pete , the grinning younger one said . Forget about it . Let 's get these gentlemen fed so 's we can go back to our game . Yeah , yeah , the old one said . The server with me laughed . The " fist " laughed and punched his head on the bars . The baboon raced around his cage twice as fast . The shit-covered animal put a hand on his head and began to make spitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the old attendant unlockedthe door I followed him and the other two men and the cart I was pushing into a long hallway . At each wooden door we paused only long enough to fill a bowl and place it on the metal shelf making sure at first that the little door that opened to the shelf was closed so that whatever was behind it could n't snatch a hand or throw a bowl back . We 'll open them later , the younger attendant said . We always do it one by one because the noise is so great.  |p44My  lips moved again but still nothing came out . The old attendant found one of the little doors open , peeked inside cautiously , and then angrily slammed it closed . You know that hairy one back there , the younger attendantsaid . I nodded as I filled another bowl and put it on a shelf . He 's a real funny one , he continued . You know how everythingtoday is in spray cans . You know , like fly killer , whipped cream , deodorants , things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People sure have it easy today do n't they . Well , he thinks he 's a spray can . Every time he gets to worrying about something which is most of the time , he puts one finger on top of his head and starts spitting on the other patients like a spray can . That 's why he 's locked up instead of in a room . I nodded . We gave to and passed by the last of the small doors . We were now at the end of the hall and in front of the big double door that led to the main room of the ward . There was a long green bench on one side of the door . On it five men wearing gray shirts and socks sat with their backs against the cold-lookingwall . At this end of the hall and all around the sitting men the wall was special . Every inch from the floor to the ceiling , from the frame of the door to an empty bulletin board , had been crayoned with red , green , and blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been on the ward . There were tiny marks , long sweeping arcs , red portraits of suffering Jesusesp45on blue wobbly crosses , fat and skinny studies of green nudes and cocks , boxes finished and unfinished , lines that went over and over until the crayon must have broken , five-sided , sixsided , and eleven-sided stars , cats and dogs , one unicorn , boxes , lines , smudges , erasures , fuck-your-mothers , scribbles , boxes , dates , scribbles , vast blue-colored fields with red suns , houses , trees , flowers , birds with big beaks , a smaller unicorn as if the drawer had stopped believing in the first , more scribbles and boxes , more smudges , and one clean spot near the ceiling that no one had tried to erase or draw over where someone had carefullydrawn in large blue letters the word WHY . One of the men on the bench was painting a picture in the air with his hands . One was so fat his belly looked like a balloonwith the blowing button pushed in so far that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go flying to the ceiling . Anotherhad his head between his bony knees . He was spitting drop after drop into a small lake on the floor as if he were wondering how much it would take to drown . The other two were young , a little older than me I think . One of them was staring into space as if he were watching all the angels of heaven melting through the wall . The other thought himself a bird with a broken wing . We gave a bowl apiece to the lucky ones on the bench and put all the rest of the bowls in a line on the floor for the noisy ones behind the doors . While helping with the bowls I looked again at the faces of the men on the bench . They were empty . Even the eyes of the happy boy were like ponds where fishp46ca n't live because of the lack of things fish live on . I left their faces to look at the more interesting brown or red puffy bulges between their legs . Unlike their faces these ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or too small to be serious . I looked at the fat guy and remembered an old rabbit that must have done it too often . He was all shriveled up like two dried-out and stepped-on peaches . I hated myself for looking at them like that but I just could n't help it . After having finished with the last bowl of food we were given last night 's empty dirty bowls and we stacked them on the cart and walked back to the elevator where I tried not to look at the three caged men . Who is kept in this ward , I asked the man with me without thinking . I never thought about it before , he said as we waited at the elevator gate . But I guess it 's one of the violent wards . I looked past the cages and down the hall to where we had put the food . The younger attendant was uncurling a thick fire hose . The old bastard was unlocking and opening the doors . Three half-naked hopeful men appeared in the doorway . The wheel turned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think by the sounds , and washed them together with any of their debris toward wherever the attendants had decided they were to eat . Which are the violent , I said to the man with me . He did n't answer . I guess he did n't hear . What the hell did it matter.  |p47He  blinks . I blink . The air blowing in our window is chilly . Good morning , Chuck . Good morning . How do you feel today , I say . No answer . I quietly get out of bed and go over to his . His mouth is open to let in and out the sobs of pain . I squat on the floor and touch his shoulder . Is there anything I can get you , I say as I 've said before dozens of times . No , he whispers . My damn head feels as if it were going to explode and no one cares . I do n't say anything because there is n't anything to say . The only thing I think of is I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violent ward . I do n't have anyone else to tell . It 's very unfair . Who the hell cares where I 've been or what I think anyway . I 'm not going to breakfast , he says . Tell the nurse I need a doctor . Okay , Chuck . You just stay quiet and I 'll get dressed and get the nurse . Hurry , he says . Do n't you worry , I say as I pull the dungarees over my shorts and try to remember where I threw my shirt . Hurry , he whispers again as I put on the second shoe and run out the door and across the hall to pee.  |p48What  's your hurry , some silly man in gray pajamas asks me as he moves three over to stand next to me at the urinal . Damn , I wish it would come out faster , I think to myself , trying to ignore him . You got a real nice one , he says moving closer . Splash , splash , I move two away and look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I 'm done I run out the door wishing he 'd follow me so I could report him to a nurse . But there are n't any nurses or attendants in the dayroom or in the office either and besides he is n't following me anyway . It 's very cold in the dayroom because some nut has left the front doors open but the clean air is blowing away the stink of disinfectantand the sun is shining and the grass is green and I want so much to forget that violent ward and all the naked creeps in the world so I run out to the steps and down the steps to the sidewalk and the lawn and the stream and quack quack you stupid normal ducks do n't swim away I wo n't hurt you I could n't hurt anybody because the sun is shining and I 'll tell my boss I 'll never go to another ward of dead dead or alive dead because I 'm alive alive and I 'm glad I am.  |p49Good  morning boss . He looks at me as if I were crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tables , he says . Yes sir , but I ca n't deliver to building K any more because my doctor thinks I 'm too young . Then you stay here and clean out the ice box real good , he says . Yes sir , I say . But when can I ever go back to the girls ' ward . The carts for them whores always go out before you come in and besides you 're too young for that too . Just clean out that ice box real good . Yes sir . I fill up all the metal salt shakers and carry them on a tray to each table and put them next to the tin bowls of sugar and the tin-foil ashtrays . When I 'm half done I hear the carts starting to rumble into the tunnel . I work faster my fingers shaking . More carts go out . But I ca n't , I think to myself . I just ca n't . I run from table to table . I hear the last of the carts being set up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put my last five salt shakerson one table and run to the kitchen . That 's enough bread , I hear the boss tell two servers . Butp50you might as well put the rest of the stew in . And what they do n't eat the pigs will . Three carts for E go out and then two for G. The four for K follow them down the ramp and into the tunnel . When my boss is n't looking I join the last two . Well hello , my stupid server friend says . You coming too . Yes , I say . He gives me the job of pushing as I knew he would . The other server turns around to see what is stopping the parade and some hot gravy splashes on his hand but he does n't seem to mind that either . We go down the tunnel to that elevator gate where we delivered last time . The first two carts stop there and the servers ring the bell but we continue on past and go down a section of tunnel I did n't know was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet and in some places there are bulges and cracks which split the wall from top to bottom . In these cracks mosses grow and noisy crickets hide . The wirecoveredlight bulbs are dimmer here than in any other part of the tunnel and the floor is littered with plaster bits and dirt . I have to be careful not to hit a bump that would send the gravy on my hand because unlike the other server I would yell and the way the cement ceiling is warped by age and weight it might get angry like an avalanche and bury us in all those nuts who live above . At the final of three long turns we come to a rusty gate and ring a bell . After a few moments in which I almost started to go back to clean the ice box a door opens and a huge ugly attend/ant turns on a light and unlocks the gate . We go through a short hallway and into a dayroom which is unlike any dayroom I 've ever seen before . The green tile floor is polished like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One is hung with dozens of large dark Goya paintings . Another is completely covered with pictures of heavily muscled body builders . The air is perfumed like a lady 's bedroom and the tiny attendant who gets up from a white marble desk and glides over to us sounds just like a lady when he says , come this way boys . We follow him to a big double wooden door which is locked with three heavy-looking wooden bars resting in thick arms of black iron . The funny thing is that both the bars and the arms are bolted to the doors and also to the walls and I ca n't figure out how they open . The big attendant comes over without a word and helps us to fill the bowls and line them neatly on the floor while the little one watches holding a mop . When we 've filled all the bowls the little one takes the end of the mop and bangs on a metal slat in the middle of one door . It slides open in squeaky jumps . First there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in it . Then there is a sound behind the door to prove me wrong . It 's only a scratch on the door at first and then a rub . Then something hits it and begins to pound and there 's a shout from farther away and now lots of shouts and the sounds of fast footsteps and things hitting and pounding at the door so loud that I jump back but when I see my server friend clean/ing his nails over the bowls and the little attendant smiling at me with his head tilted and the big attendant and the other server putting bowl after bowl through the slat where they quickly disappear and when I look to the floor and see gravy flowing from the crack at the bottom of the doors I get closer and try to look inside but I ca n't see anything because of the darkness and all the arms putting bowls up and now my ears are beginning to hurt with the sound with the sound and these are not the sounds of the mad people I am so used to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids once poured gasoline on and lit these are the sounds are the sounds of a thousand burning cats and I get closer and push away the arm of the big attendant and he laughs and he laughs and for a brief century I look through the slat and there are men and I think women and naked things with fur that screech and crawl and I think I know how long forever is forever is it 's a mirror it 's a mirror in front of a mirror in front of a mirror and for the first time I think I may go mad and have to join them and a cold fear gets inside my furry body and I ca n't move and I 'm grabbed by the big attendant and pushed into a purple Goya corner where I stand and watch as the others put bowl after bowl after bowl after bowl . A quiet week has passed . I ca n't remember a single night that I have n't fallen asleep while listening to the moans of Chuck or a single morning I 've woke up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not used to the nightmares I now have which are much worse than the thing that caused them . This however , is a happier morning than usual . My boss has promised me a visit to the girls ' building to cheer me up . Will the girl in pink still be there , I wonder . I sure hope so . I put things on the cart which should n't be there like a couple of bananas , three oranges , and as many extra half-pints of milk as I can steal from the ice box . At the end of the long trip the door to the girls ' building is unlocked by the same fat matron . Stupid and I go up the ramp and enter the hallway . As before she orders us to stop and yells : Ea  --  Ting  --  Time . Again the doors fly open and the pajama-wearing girls flow into the hallway in front of our cart , rubbing the sleep from their eyes and yawning . There are more coloreds in this group . One is quite pretty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says . One of the boy nuts is with us . Several laugh . They all line up , chattering and giggling and pointing at me and I love it . Shut up  --  Eat , the matron bellows . One by one they file past to pick up their trays so I can slop on the cereal and give one half-pint of milk apiece and then they go to the other server and get the cold buttered toast and cut-up sausages . I do n't see either of my two friends at first but I do see two of the three rabbits . Hi mister , one says . Hi , I say and give her an extra half-pint of milk and a banana.  |p54I  serve four more girls . The fifth is my Cindy . She still wears the tight pink pajamas with the red roses and she still has the same long pony tail pinched at her lovely head by a rubber band . I stare and smile my best smile and she smiles back . I give her an extra half-pint and she thanks me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her before she goes but she goes too fast . I turn around so that at least my eyes can follow her and I see her turn around to glance at me again and I also see the matron screwing up her fat face because some girl is sobbing at the end of the hall by the tunnel door . I serve two more girls and then the sobs turn into a long screech . Something that was made of glass breaks . The matron rushes toward the sound . All the girls begin to scream or laugh and most of them follow . One of the rabbits runs to me and grabs my leg and begins to cry . I do n't know what to do . The girl named Janice solves my problem by coming out of nowhere and grabbing the child by the arms and pushing her away . Go away now honey . Everything 's all right , she tells her . This is the way I planned it , she says to me , taking me by the hand and pulling me into a room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pink frills and lace curtains and a soft cleanliness I 'm not used to . She presses her body against mine and breathing heavily she touches every inch of my face with her tongue and lips and goes to my ear and down to my neck and her hands feel be/tween my legs on both sides . Suddenly she pushes away because the rabbit is standing in the doorway her big eyes staring . Cindy is standing next to her . You are n't supposed to be here , Janice says . The rabbit starts to cry again . Oh all right then , little one , Janice says . You stay at the door and tell me when the bitch is coming back and do n't you look in here once , do you hear . The rabbit nods and turns around . Come here , Cindy , quickly quickly , Janice says taking her hand and pulling her over to us . What 's your name pretty boy , she asks me . Timmy , I think , I say . What a ridiculous name for a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cindy and she says she likes you . Cindy my friend , this is Timmy I think , she says pushing her against a dresser making a glass fall off and break . Have you ever seen a naked girl before , Janice says . No , I say . Watch this then , she says going to Cindy and ripping open the top of her pajamas and folding them over the shoulders of the frightened girl who does n't even flinch . The buttons fall to the floor . Her pink breasts are tiny and wet with perspiration . Her whole body is breathing in and out , even faster than mine . And this , Janice says turning her around and pulling down her bottoms . No , I say quietly . And this , she says turning her around again and grabbing her hard between the legs and then grabbingme and shoving me against Cindy who is now beginning to cry . Go ahead and fuck , Janice yells at me . Come on now we do n't have much time left , she yells louder . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at something I 'd never seen before . Damn , Janice says and grabs me by the waist and unzips my fly . Damn , she says again when she ca n't find the opening in my shorts . The bitch is coming , the rabbit whispers from the doorway without turning around . Get out of here you bastard , Janice says while pushing me to the door . But first button up your damn pants . Today is the best day so far . Good morning , Chuck , how do you feel . Good morning , Timmy , I feel pretty good today , and how do you feel . Magnificent , I say . I hop out of bed and run to pee . I look in the bathroom mirror . Even my ears do n't stick out too much . Good morning , nurse Jenkins , I say . Good morning , Timmy , she says , surprised . It 's a lovely day . Yes it is , I say . I dress and walk outside . The air is cool and fresh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges . The wing of one goes up to allow the yellow beak to go under and scratch . Then it sees something better beneath the water and dives . Good morning ducks . Quack quack , they say . A green dragonfly flies by to do whatever green dragonfliesdo . The trees are turning color fast . Orange and yellow and red . Good morning , I say to the vegetables by the back door of the kitchen . They grin and peel.  |p57Good  morning , I say to the men in the kitchen . Good morning , my boss says . Can I go to the girls ' building again this morning , I ask him . Why , you got a girlfriend there or something , he says . Yes , I say . She 's very pretty and she ... . They 've already been served , he says . You leave them whores alone . They 're no good for a young boy like you . Yes I know , I say . But I ... . Fill up those carts over there , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the ice box . Okay , I say . Maybe at lunch time , I think to myself . Or maybe at supper I 'll see her again . An hour of hard work goes by but I do n't mind . An attendant flunky comes in . Is a kid named Timmy here , he calls out . Here I am , I say . Report to your doctor at once , he says . Why , I did n't do anything , I say . Just do it , he says and leaves . My God , what does the doctor want . Did he find out about what happened yesterday . I hope I 'm not in trouble . I hope the girls are n't either . I go to his office in the alcoholic ward and knock on his door . Come in , he says . Good morning doctor , I smile , hoping to disarm him.  |p58Good  morning , Timmy , he says . He 's smiling too . That 's a good sign . Sit down , Tim , I have some wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going home today , Timmy . You 've passed all the tests . Your foster parents have agreed to take you back with them providing you behave yourself . I sit and stare . I said you 're going home , Timmy , is n't that wonderful . Yes , I say . It is . It really is . They 're coming to pick you up at three this afternoon . Are they sending the car with bars , I think to myself . So you get your suitcase packed and wait in your room , hesays . Good luck . I hope never to see you again . Oh Lord , Lord . My numbed body floats into the sun and across the lawn . A fat woman glances up laughing . A dog barks . A school bell rings . What did he say . What did he say . I 'm actually going home . I feel myself running as fast as I can up the steps , down the hall , into our room . Chuck is still asleep . Chuck , wake up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move . I begin to shake him . Chuck , c'm on , wake up . I 'm going home , I 'm going home . His arm is like ice . I touch his forehead . It 's like ice too.  |p59Chuck  , my God , I was going home , I really was . I let my fingers drop from his forehead to his mouth all wet with blood and spit . I look away from my only friend and up to the yellow ceiling . I take away my fingers and put them to my own mouth . A scream from miles away hits my ears like an explosive . I awake . I try to open my eyes but ca n't . Damp sheets are all around me . My right hand as always goes to the warmth betweenmy legs . It is hot there and wet , much more than usual . I feel the end of a sheet half-touching my lips . The breath that returns to my nose is not pleasant . Are my teeth decaying . No , that ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am just too weak . My right arm moves to the familiar wall . There is a pain at my shoulder . The wall feels different somehow . There are holes where bumps should be . One crack is now crossed by three . My finger explores . One goes up a ways , then down a ways , then to the right , dropping into a hole of falling plaster . No , that 's not right . It should n't do that . My left hand moves to feel the familiar air . It is stopped by the sheets . That does n't make sense . Who could 've tucked them in . Chuck never did that before . I get a little scared . I try top60open my eyes . They are stuck tight by that gluey white stuff I always have when I get sick with fever . But I do n't feel sick , I just feel weak . I do n't understand it . I ca n't be sick because then I 'd be at home . I 'm not at home because our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling asleep . I begin to dream of someone screaming but I do n't worry because Cindy is with me . I awake . My sheets are soaking wet . I feel very weak . The first thing I hear is the echo of an old scream and then a strange quiet . My hands struggle to find my eyes . I rub them hard and they come apart . The first thing I see is the wireprotectedlight bulb sprouting like an inflamed wart from a ceiling of gray and white patches . Far below that I see the door with the porthole a few feet from the foot of the bed and I see the walls on both sides that are a darker green . I turn my head up on the pillow and see an upside-down barred and screened window with a dusty radiator below it that is making noises . I begin slowly to remember and I know I am locked away in a different room in a different building . I pull the wet sheets from their tucked place and away from me and try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if I 'm asleep . My head begins to tingle . I hear someone screaming and someone else crying . I shake my head and it all goes away and I begin to see again . Gray pajamas hang all over me . They hide my hands and feet . I roll them up and try to stand . The blackness comes againp61but not so bad this time . I walk to the door and look out the hole . There is another door with a hole just across from me . Someone in that room is moaning . The hall is empty . There is no other noise . I walk to the radiator . Ouch , it 's hot . I try to look out the window . It is hard because the wire mesh beyond the bars is covered with green paint and dust . But there are some holes in the screen and through it I can see a green lawn . There is also a stream down there . A white duck floats on it . I remember everything now . Chuck is dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home . I go back to the bed . The sheets are still too wet so I get on the brown blanket and pull some of it over me and go to sleep . I wake up some time later to a jangle of keys , my lock turning , my door opening . A skinny , white-coated attendant walks in . He is balancing a tray in one hand , a bunch of comic books and a ring of keys in the other . How do you feel now , kid , he says . Okay , I say . He carefully puts the tray on my bed by my feet , and says , here 's your lunch and I brought you some of my funny books . I stare at him . My name is Henry , he says , handing me the books . I take them and stare at him . Everyone calls me Skinny but I do n't like that name , hep62says , bending down and reaching under my bed to bring out a round porcelain tub . This is your toilet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say . Do you have to go now , he says . No , I say . He waits a few seconds , staring at me to make me feel bad . He succeeds . If you need me for anything , knock on your door . My office is just down the hall , he says , then leaves , locking the door behind him . I hear his footsteps getting farther away . I hear a faint voice saying , he does n't belong here you know . I hear my new friend saying , You leave him alone , Charlie . He 's all right where he is . When his doctor calls , you give the phone to me . There is more being said but the one in the room across from me begins to holler so I do n't hear it . The stuff in the tray is the same I 've served many times to the vegetables and the violent . There is stew and brown peach slices and cold coffee in a dented cup that has a handle missing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt sitting all alone in the middle of one compartment . The stew has slopped into it and it is brown and soggy . I do n't eat anything . I put the tray on the floor and get up to move the blanket and top sheet to the foot of the bed so the sheets can dry out . Both sheets are yellow in some places . The bottom one has some little holes and one big one . Out of the big one a white bug isp63crawling . I go to the door to make sure no one is looking and cry . I awake . The spots of light that come from the sun have moved from the top of one wall to the bottom . I hear someone screaming . I hear footsteps , the jangle of keys . I wrap the brown blanket around me and wait . A key sounds in the lock , the door opens , the same attendantcomes in carrying another tray and another bunch of comics . Hello , Timmy , I 'm here again , he says . I stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my feet . He hands me the comics and says , here , I brought you some more . He sees the full tray on the floor . Why , you have n't eaten a thing , he says . Oh you poor boy , are n't you hungry . I do n't say anything . You have to eat you know , so that you 'll get better . He 's said that to hundreds of others , I think to myself . He sits on the bed by my left arm . He puts one hand on my forehead . Your head 's still quite warm , he says . He puts his other hand on my stomach as if to see if it was still there . And you 're so skinny . You really have to eat . Do you want me to feed you . No , I say , wishing he 'd take away his hands . Now sit up in bed , he says . With my back against the iron bedstead I sit up , beingp64careful to keep myself surrounded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray in my lap . Poor little Timmy , he says . Now you eat everything on this tray and I 'll be back to take it away later . I pick up a spoon and play with a baked potato . He looks back to the tray on the floor . He now sees the thrown comics . He gets up , taking the ones he had just given me and the ones on the floor and leaves without a word , locking the door behind him . By the time the sun had reached the other wall and was beginning to fade on an upward journey , he came back . I had turned the mattress over so there would n't be so many holes showing , and had again tried to dry out the sheets and maybe kill anything that might be on them by putting them on the hot radiator . I was sitting on the floor wondering how I could wash myself or comb my hair without a sink and mirror . What are you sitting on the floor for , he says . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet , I say . And there 're bugs in the mattress . He looks at the half-empty tray on the floor beside me . Well , he says . At least you 've eaten something . I 'll tell you what , Timmy . If you promise to be a good boy I 'll get you a better mattress and some clean sheets . I promise.  |p65Of  course you do , he says . Now come over here . Sit here by me . I go to the bed and sit down . I can do other things for you , Timmy , he says , putting his hand on my knee . I can get you out of here real fast and over to that boys ' ward . Can you , I say . Yes , he says . I can tell your doctor that you 've gotten over your little breakdown and that you 've forgotten about your dead friend , and I can even recommend to him that you be sent home . To Chuck , I say . No , to your doctor , silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe him . He puts his arm around me and hugs me close . Now you do what I say and I 'll make things around here very pleasant for you . Yes , I say . He kisses me on the cheek . He 's the crazy one , I think to myself , wishing he 'd leave . His hand goes up and down my side . What 's he looking for . Where is my comb , I say to him . I 'll get you one later , he says , putting his hand in my hair . Can I get a mirror too . Yes , yes , he says , pushing on my head . Can I take a shower.  |p66Yes  , yes , he says in a different voice . My head comes back like a spring and I 'm glad he 's decided not to push it any farther down . You wait here a few minutes , he says . I 'll see if the showers are empty . He kisses me again and picks up the tray , winks at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far down the hall . There is an argument between my new friend and someone else a few doors away . I hear footsteps , my lock turns again , the door opens . My friend has a mattress under his arm . It looks even worse than the one I have . He throws it on the floor . A swirl of dust rises . I 'll take the old one out later , he says . C'm on , your shower is ready . The hall is one I 'd never seen before . It is dirtier than most . It smells of bodies and of wet plaster . The usual disinfectant smell is gone . I wonder if that 's good or bad . Rows of rooms are passed . Some have faces at the holes , some do n't . Some make noises , some do n't . Three doors before the office and four before a dayroom filled with men dressed in gray uniforms we reach and go into the toilet and shower room . The shower is as naked as the men who go under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no walls around it.  |p67He  sits on the edge of one of the sinks and says , there 's some soap in the dish and that towel over there on the window ledge is yours . Oh , and here , he says digging into his pocket . Here 's a comb for you . I take the comb , thank him , and search for a pocket to put it in . Go ahead , get undressed , he says . I already tested the water for you . It should be just right . No , I think to myself . But I stink so bad , what else can I do . I take my pajamas off and move under the water . I feel his eyes on me all the time . I wish this hot water could wash my brain , I think to myself . It feels so good but I wish it could hide me . Back in the room he sits with me on the bed again . You must feel better now , he says . YesIdo , Isay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub . Again he tries to push my head down . Again , like a spring , I refuse . He opens my pajama shirt and begins to lick my stomach and I feel even dirtier than before I had the shower . He unties the string on my pajama pants and begins to pull them down . I 've had enough , I think to myself . No , I say and push his hands away and cover up . He gets mad and I wish I 'd never said anything . You dirty queer , he says . You crazy sick bastard , he shouts in my ear beforegetting up and opening the door . P68I suppose so , I think to myself as he locks the door and walks down the hallway . Anyway I have the mattress and the comb . Every morning when the sun is in crack seven the breakfastcomes . By crack fifteen the lunch is in and out . By number thirty-two and the disappearing time the supper tray is taken . At this lovely moment of the day I get to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into a toilet bowl . The men in the dayroom wait for me to do this each evening and when they see me coming some become silent and some laugh . Sometimes the big attendant brings my meals and sometimes the skinny one does . The big guy never says anything . He always seems to be thinking about something else . But the skinny one , he always thinks of me . He does n't say much but his hands almost never leave my body except when there are others around . I do n't let him do much but he sure loves to try . They do n't let me shower any more and I do n't ask them to . My feet are turning black . I stink all over . My hair is becomingso long that it is always falling in my eyes . But I guess there 's not much to see anyway . After supper when the lights go away I leave the top of my bed and climb between the sheets and try to sleep . There 's almost as much noise at night as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the day , between the meals , I get very lonely . I tryp69to talk to the guy across from me but all he wants to do is moan and scream . The few times he does come to his hole he laughs and that is even worse . Between those meals I sleep a little or walk around or watch the ducks on the stream through the holes in the screen or play my games . I have many games . Every morning before breakfast the men around me leave their rooms and go to the dayroom . Every evening after supper they return . Once in a while they peer in at me with sad or grinning faces but they very seldom say anything . I wonder if they wonder why I ca n't walk with them . My game is this : I can see into their minds and I can tell how they see me . I am not a scared fourteen-year-old in dirty pajamas . I am a crazy Russian scientist with the strength of ten men and a mind so brilliant that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men on the ward into taking over the building , the hospital , the town beyond , and beyond that who knows , maybe the world . I am the only one in the whole stupid world who knows that certain small amounts of saltpeter , lemon juice , wall scrapings , teeth fillings , and potato peels when mixed together at a certain temperature and thrown at the correct angle will blow a wall to pieces and if a certain mold that is usually found in stew is added , the name of which I dare not even think to myself , the bomb would be powerful enough to destroyevery living thing in a radius of sixty-three miles . ( My home is sixty miles away . Their only friends live three miles from them . They would n't escape by visiting . ) I of course would not be harmed because I am also the only living beingp70who knows that the surest protection from a blast is a peesoddenmattress . I have many games . One of my two blankets is fairly new and sheds like a summer dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brown fluff and separate them into piles of various sizes . One big pile goes to the head of the bed by the pillow and another goes to the foot . I line several smaller piles on the shores of the side by the wall . Each pile is a country . Each country has its own pile of exportable goods sitting in a warehouse by a pier that stands at the end of an ocean of blankets . The bigger the pile the bigger and more important that country must be . To survive , all these countries must trade with each other . The fluff that is the most tradable is the wettestor the cleanest or the softest . The most expensive of all is the rare kind that has red threads . It takes two very soft ones and one wet one to gain one with red threads and even then the loser of the red-threaded one is being cheated . These trades are very important to the life of the countries . Guns are barteredfor sausages and sewing needles for moth balls . The needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are sometimes problems . Maybe the balls of a moth are too small or maybe the needles have eyes where the points should be or maybe those guns , that were given with lifetime guarantees , killed off half the army during training by backfiringbecause of the barrels being stuffed with rotten peanut butter gotten from last month 's trade . Little things like thisp71spell instant war . Merchant ships are quickly refitted with guns . Newer models with guns already in place are bought from friendly nations who scrape the walls to find the plaster pieces to sell . The enemy ships sail forth and meet in the middle . Both fleets are destroyed . The two countries must rearm again . This time they are more careful . Hit-and-run raids take the place of battles . The admiralties of both nations are at first pleased at the slow rate of death of their own ships and men . But soon they begin to realize that the enemy 's death rate is also slow . War is not enough , they shout . Hit-and-run is not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know peace for a thousand years . All the fluff is now used to build more ships with guns . The blanket ocean becomes a sea of death and danger for all nations and they in turn join sides and all trade is stopped and millions of people starve and marshmallow factories shut down and spies get locked up in dirty pajamas and the sea is littered with the corpses of broken plaster and soon there are so many graveyardsin the sea that the ships could n't trade again even if they wanted to for fear of being sunk by some half-submerged hulk they had sunk some years ago when the war was really fun and soon the land becomes a dessert and the people eat each other and get sad diseases and then one man speaks out against cruelty and chamber tubs and out-of-work shipbuilders and for peace and friendship and for unlocking the doors of jails and for reopening the marshmallow factory and he is n't evenp72the Pope or President or anything like that , he 's only a little boy , but before any of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush all the nations to the floor as the lights are now going out and it 's time for bed . It is morning again . The men are walking by my door . 01-le face looks through the hole and then another . I look away . Several more pass . I feel another face at the door looking at me and I hear something drop to the floor . I wait till they 're all past and I get up , first rolling my pajama sleeves and cuffs where they 've fallen in the night , and go to the door . On the floor there are two cigarettes and three wooden matches . I look out my porthole to see if there 's anyone around . I pick up my presents and try to smoke one . This is about my fourth cigarette in my whole life so at first I cough a little , but soon it becomes rather nice and I clip the end of it as I 've seen others do so many times . I hide it under the radiator to save it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He puts it on the bed as always and begins to press me into the corner by the radiator . I 'm glad it 's not on . He holds me by the arms and tries to kiss my neck . He puts one hand on my crotch andp73hurts me bad . I begin to fight him and he stops . He almost seems happy . Timmy , he says . Let me fool around with you for a little and I 'll let you out in the dayroom from now on . Please let me out , please , I think to myself . No , I say . He raises his hand high in the air and brings it down hard on my head . I fall to the floor and punch at his leg . He leaves , saying , you will , you will . I eat my breakfast hoping the pain in my stomach will go away fast . I smoke the half of the cigarette and save the other for lunch . At lunch he comes in again , bringing another tray . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . He looks at me strangely and leaves , banging my door closed . I eat and smoke the last cigarette . At the usual time of the thirty-second crack , he comes in with the supper tray . Your doctor called me today to ask me how you were doing , he says . I told him you refused to cooperate with us in any way . I stare at him . How would you like a nice hot shower and some funny books , he says . P74Yes . Then let me pull down your pants , he says . Let me .. . No . He picks up the two empty trays and leaves . I hear the men going back to their rooms . I wait for more cigarettes but none come . The only face that looks through the hole whistles at me and then moves on with the others . The lights go out in my room and then in the hallway . I wait for the attendant to get my tray and to let me empty my tub . He does n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to usel , it real bad . It stinks so much and I stink so much and I never knew people could stink so bad and I wish he 'd let me empty it and I 'm so lonely I want to die . Please God kill me . There are no more shadows to watch and no more games to play , at least for now . I walk back and forth from the door to the radiator . I look out the window but the ducks have alreadyhid themselves under a bridge I ca n't see . All the world is black except for one porthole which shows on one of its rounded edges the pale light of a far-away office . It is now time for short prayers and long thoughts of Cindy . It will then be time for sleep . At crack seven the breakfast tray comes in the door . It sure stinks in here , the attendant says . Can I empty my tub please , I ask . P75Here 's your breakfast , he says before picking up last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go so bad I can hardly stand it . Back and forth I walk between the door and radiator wondering if I should knock . I must n't think about it . At lunch time I 'll demand to be let out and I will be . I must n't think about it . I lie on the bed and stare at the ceiling . My pajamas are wet from the seepage of my arms , legs , and stomach . I rememberin school where they taught us of cesspools and how they worked . What did we care . The only other word I remember from school is osmosis . Where one thing changes floats becomesanother . Trying not to think of osmosis I build on the ceiling large castles with open doors and wide windows . The cracks become roads . One lone roach walks on one road . Would you like to visit my castle , I say to him . Sure , why not , he says to me . Keep on the same road , I say . Turn left at the highway where the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep on going till you come to my door . Okay , he says . Do n't bother to knock , I say . The door 's always open . I wo n't , thankyou , he says . And when you get there , I say , there 's all the good food you could ever hope to eat . Thankyou , he says . But , I say , there 's no bathroom so be careful you do n't eat too much . I never heard of such a thing , he says . Why is there no bathroom . Because I want to turn you into a stink bug , I say . Oh , he says . I understand . I thought you would , I say.  |p76By  crack fourteen and a half he comes in with the lunch tray and puts it on the bed . I do n't feel so good , I say to him . Why , what 's wrong . I have a stomach-ache , I say . And I have to use the tub but it 's too full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says and leaves . By crack twenty-eight I feel terribly sick . My head hurts , my stomach seems about to explode . I 've wet my pajamas several times both front and back and for several hours I 've done nothing but walk back and forth between the door and the radiator . Somewhere between thirty-one and blackness he comes in again with the supper tray , looks at me in disgust , takes the other full one out and leaves , laughing all the way down the hall . A few minutes later it is time for the men to go back to their rooms . A face I 'd never seen before appears at the hole . A whole pack of cigarettes along with a pack of matches drops to the floor . Thankyou , I hear myself say . The face goes away . Thank God , I think to myself . This will give me something to do until he comes back and lets me go to the bathroom . But he does n't come . The lights go out . I hear someonep77banging his head on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasts longer than I 'd ever heard a scream last before . I put my fourth cigarette out and hide the pack along with the matches beneath the radiator . I walk to the door again and again . The pain in my stomach is growing . I knock on the door . I bang on the door with both hands . Okay , I yell , I 'm ready . Please let me out . I have to go awful bad . Across from me the man at his hole screeches with laughter . Two more down the hall begin to laugh . Someone screams . I go to the radiator , getting as close to the window as possible and let my pants fall . I let go and the steam shoots upward smothering me in a stink of pleasure . The front of my knees burn against the hot metal . I feel the back of them becoming brown and ugly . I feel as though one half of my body had left the other . Later , after a rest on the bed I clean up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the tub . Then I pull the sheets and covers around me and wish to God I was dead . Morning comes . Someone knocks on the door . The same attendant opens it , bringing in the breakfast and putting it by my feet . I turn over and keep my head covered so I do n't have to look at him . He pulls all the sheets and covers off me to the floor and sits down , rubbing the back of my neck . Okay , he asks.  |p78Okay  , I say . Starting at my neck and going down my back he cleans every inch of me like a cat . After the feet are finished he turns me over and does the same from the top of my head to the bottoms of those same black feet . I did n't realize I had so many places on my body . An hour or so later , two sheets , one blanket and another pajama bottom come in and the tub and almost every other dirty thing goes out . Without a word he closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take out my cigarettes . They are yellow and wet and falling apart and stinking of piss . I put them under the bed and eat breakfast . Just before lunch someone unlocks my door and walks away . I am sitting on my bed building a town with the cracks on the wall when I hear it . I get up and push on the door . It opens . I look back to my town . For a few seconds I hate to leave it . But I do and walk out to the hallway and down to the office . Both attendants are sitting inside reading comics . The skinny one looks up and sees me . I do n't know if I should run back to the room or not . Go ahead , he says . You can go to the dayroom . You 've earned it . The big attendant looks up at him in a funny way then goes back to his comic . Without thanking either one I go to the doorway of the dayroom and look in at all the gray-suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all those people , I think to myself . The big attendant comes in back of me . Go ahead in boy , there 's a tray over there by the window for you . Then he goes back to the office . The men have heard his voice . They see me standing in bare feet with big raggedy pajamas and smelling so bad I swear they know what I 've done . I want so badly to go back to my room but I know I ca n't . Some of those men stare at me . I do n't mind the ones who laugh but I do mind the several who begin to cry and especially the fat one who starts a scream but is hit on the head with a spoon before he can finish . No , I think to myself , no . One man from a far window table stands up and comes toward me . He is a big man with a uniform that is too small for him . He reaches out his left hand . He 's left-handed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up . I back away . He sees that I 'm frightened and drops his hand . Do n't be scared kid , he says . I wo n't hurt you . I 'm the one who gave you the cigarettes . Your tray is on my table . C'm on , it 's getting cold . That big man , that damn big man is actually talking to me as if I were human , I think to myself . He 's sitting down . He 's asking me to join him just like at a restaurant . How wonderful . How unbelievably wonderful . Maybe I wo n't have to be lonely any more . I sit down . I can feel the other men going back to their eating . The five at the table stare at me . I feel like a movie featurethat 's about to start . My name 's Joe , the big man says . Ip80look up at his face . It is wide and gentle and as unsure of me as I am of him . My thoughts come fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second thing is to talk , the third is to kiss him , the fourth , I do n't know , maybe scream or something like all the others seem to love doing when they do n't understand . I do n't do any of those things . I just stare . My name 's Joe , he says again , this time trying to smile . Someone to the left of him giggles . Shut up , Joe says , not unkindly . The other shuts . What 's your name , Joe says . Timmy , I say . Hello , Timmy . Welcome to the dayroom , he says , being the first one in all history to lower his eyes to make me feel better . Hello , I say . Hello hello hello , I think to myself , and begin to eat . At the end of eating two men collect all the trays and pile them on a cart by the door that goes , I guess , to an elevator and to the tunnel and back to the kitchen . A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a white uniform stands by him . That 's the man who hired me for the kitchen job , I think to myself . Hello , I say to him , being happy anyway but being especiallyhappy at seeing a familiar face . He glances at me in the same way I 've seen him glance at men who crawl on the floor and eat shit . The young boy withp81him pushes some guy out of the way who was standing in the doorway asking for more food . I never did that . The big attendant comes out of his office and hands wet rags to everybody . He gives one to Joe who is even bigger and he gives one to me . You got to help clean up them tables , he says to me . Okay , I say , and begin to clean . After he 's gone back to the office Joe comes over to me . You do n't look quite so frightened now , he says . No , I say , before the big attendant slams the office door and makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . He wo n't hurt you . I 'm not , I say . He used to be a patient in this ward , Joe says . Five years ago when there were n't enough men to do this ugly work he volunteered . He was better than any of us so the doctor chose him . Since then I 've watched him getting worse year by year . You were here when he left , I say , after we had thrown our rags onto a pile and had gone back to our chairs . Yes , Joe says with his hands on the table playing with a piece of string . But he never leaves . The skinny one is the only one paid by the state . He 's the only one who ever gets to touch the keys and the only one who ever leaves here outside of the little colored man who comes on Sundays . Oh , I say . Why are you here with us , Joe says , looking down at me.  |p82I  was in reception when a friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went a little crazy . We all do that sometimes , Joe says . But why are you in the hospital in the first place . Because my adopted parents did n't want me any more . Oh , Joe says . They never wanted me either but until I killed one of them they had to keep me . Oh , I say . I help the other men move the five tables to one end of the room and all the chairs to the other end . Why do we have to do this , I say to Joe . It gives us something to do . What do we do next , I say . Just sit around and talk and wait for the next meal , he says . Then we move the chairs and tables back . You do n't do anything else all day , I say . There 's nothing else to do . For a long time I sit with Joe on one of the tables , even though we 're not supposed to , and talk , mostly about the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel is still there . I begin to feel very sorry for him . But it feels good to talk . It 's been such a long time since anyone has wanted to listen . It also feels good to be able to break one small rule . Before the food cart comes up again we move all the chairs and tables back . During supper Joe introduces me to his fourp83friends . The one called Gig , the one who giggled when I sat down to lunch , is tiny like a mouse . His eyes never stay still . The big tough-looking guy sitting next to him is Johnny . He seems ready to spring in an instant at anyone else 's command . Across from them and to my right there is Dew . He is small and pretty and looks like a girl . I can see every vein in his arms . The one next to him is Kirk . He is the oldest . He is almost the ugliest man I have ever seen . His nose takes up most of his face . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like a face . Hi , I say . Hi , each one says . What do you think of our little place , Kirk says . I do n't like it , I say . In reception I could go all over the grounds . I sure wish I could leave . They all stare at me as if I 'd said the worst thing in the world . I 'd better watch what I say , I think to myself . Ha , do n't we all , says Johnny . What 's it like out there , says Dew . Where , in the town , I say . No , he says . On the grounds . Do they still have the Sweet Shoppe by the main gate . It 's not by the main gate , I say . It 's underground , in the tunnel . The others laugh . Oh dear , says Dew . It has been a long time has n't it.  |p84In  my room , after the door is locked and the lights have gone away , I think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder why I almost never any more think of home . I think of the things that people do to others . I think of the bug I once put in a bottle with a spider . I think of the way the web crisscrossed between the glass and stopped the bug from going anywhere . I think of the way that big beautiful spider killed it and used the dead strength to spin more webs to catch more bugs which I refused to drop in . Say to the blackbirdsyou 're sorry , I once told my dog Snicky . Say to the rabbit you wo n't scare him any more . Say to the berry bush you peed on , I wo n't do that no more . But why , he said back to me . That 's all I know how to do . I go to sleep . In the morning all our doors are unlocked . My room , as far as I know , is the only one to be honored by one skinny attendantwho says , I saw you with Joe last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to keep your freedom stay away from him now lie back on the bed and let me undress you . No , no , I think to myself . In the dayroom Joe has a wonderful present for me , a pair of slippers . Thankyou Joe , I say . Thankyou very much . At the breakfast table which is also our everything-else table , Joe has another present for me . Gig , he says to the manp85on his left who is gobbling up peaches , Gig , if you do n't want any of those peaches why do n't you give them to Timmy . No thanks , I say . I 've had enough . No , no , here , says the one called Gig . You can have them all , he says going around the table to dump them on my tray . Now sit down Gig , Joe says . He sits . I stare at them both . That 's lesson number one , two , three , and four , Joe says . We do n't have much but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from going any crazier than we already are . Gig is my second-in-command and is as sick as they come and then some . He and everyone else in here does as I say because I 'm boss . Yes sir , I say . Any and all four of them would kill at the snap of my fingers , Joe says . Kirk is the newest of us . He came two years ago . He 's in here because he 's so ugly that women used to scream when he walked down the street . That kind of gets to a guy after a while . Why do n't you tell him how ugly he is . Kirk stares at me . No , I say , becoming frightened . It 's just as well , Joe says . Because if you did he would kill you before any of us could stop him . That 's lesson number five . Never talk about another person 's problems . I 'm the only one who can do that . Yes sir , I say . After breakfast and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others and sit on top of a table . Out of one eye 's corner I can see the skinny attendant watching us . I hope he does n't come over . I hope he does n't say anything to me later . You 're looking scared again , Joe says . That 's because I am I guess , I say . I 'm sorry about those five lessons , Joe says . I wanted you to learn them fast and in the easiest way possible . That 's the way all lessons should be learned . Not like this , he says , putting his hands in the air and looking around at the walls . This way takes too damn much time . Yes sir , I say . But now you have nothing to worry about , he says smiling at me . As long as I 'm here anyway , and I do n't think I 'll be goingdowntown tonight , or tomorrow night either . Thankyou Joe , I say . I hope , as long as you 're here , we can spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting his hand on my shoulder . I hope we can too , Joe . As long as I 'm here . You notice how the others never talk when someone else is talking . That 's because they 're saving it for later . They have all the time in the world to help fill in any conversation gaps . I do n't want you to ever do that with me or with anyone else either . Because when you start doing that there is no hope . I wo n't , I say . You do n't belong here with us , he says . I know , I say.  |p87I  wish you did , he says . I 'd like to keep you here with us forever . I 'd like to make you second-in-command or even first . I 'd like to be able to have the reasons for doing anything in the world for you except getting you into the world that I ca n't go to . Why , I whisper . Because you are everything I 'd forgotten about . You are what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you around only for a little while . You are all the things that mad people can never have again . I say nothing . I do n't understand . His hands are big but his fingers are gigantic . He puts one of them to my eye and it does n't hurt a bit . He moves it down my nose and stops it at my lips . You wo n't ever say anything against me , he says . I shake my head no , afraid to speak . He moves his finger down my chin and in the curve of my neck to the bone of my chest . He takes it away . You should n't be wearing those dirty pajamas , he says . They 're all I have , I say . I 'll get you some better things to wear , he says . And when are you going to take a shower . They wo n't let me . Who wo n't , he says . The skinny attendant . You go in there right now , he says . And you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he has.  |p88More  what . Never mind . That 's just a mad saying . You go take that shower . I 'll stand up for you . Are you going to watch or anything , I say . He seems surprised . What do you mean , he says . If you want me to I guess I could . That 's what the attendant likes to do . Oh , so that 's it , Joe says . I thought it was something like that . No , I wo n't watch if you do n't want me to . Why not , I say . Because I 'm in enough trouble with God just being here . Later , in my room , feeling clean and wonderful , with the memory of just one dirty look from the attendant as I was going out of the shower , I thank God for some people . As always things change . In the morning the skinny attendantunlocks and comes in my door . Give me those covers , he says . What are you holding them for . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says . I want to see my doctor , I say . Oh you do , do you , he says , ripping the sheet and cover from my hands and throwing them to the floor . And what would you tell him , you sick stupid little boy , he says , hitting me in the face with his hand . Do n't , you bastard , I yell . And what would you tell him , he says , hitting my head with hisp89fists . I 'll tell him what you do , I yell back at him . I 'll tell Joe what you do , I throw in for good measure . He takes hold of my feet and yanks me to the floor where I land hard on my back . I try to grab his leg but it begins to kick at my head . Again and again his heel pounds my head and when the blackness comes he stops . He picks me up and pushes me out of the room . I may be a little hard on my queer patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way as the others but they 're so disgusting , he says , kicking me in the legs and shouting after me , you 'll never get out of here much less tell any stupid doctor anything if you keep on acting in that disgusting way . And if you say anything to that other one I 'll lock you two in the cellar together and swallow the key and I wo n't shit it out till I die . I go into the dayroom of staring and frightened men . I 'll get even with him , I think to myself . I 'll get even with him good . Suddenly , before I can leave the crowd of babblers to look for Joe , my sight goes away , my head becomes dark , I get the old feeling again but in a different way . I am with a cousin again from many years ago . He always used to beat me . I see again the useless boredom of life as we then saw it move after move after move . The dayroom becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the math of chance is played become the squares . I have my defenses too . There by the window of supposed sanity the white kingp90sits on his wooden throne flanked by the feminine , flunky queen Dew , the ugly bishop Kirk , the quick knight Johnny , the far-away but still second most powerful Gig the rook . Surrounding me , attacking me , the pawns of both sides stare , attack , and run away from the lowest of all pawns , me . Hello , Timmy , Joe says in a sad voice . I think I know what happened . Sit down here with us . The king has spoken . White king 's bishop 's pawn moves to bishop one . He beat you did n't he , says Kirk , his hideous face inches from mine . The bishop has spoken . His church has been attacked . White king 's bishop 's pawn moves to bishop two . That bastard 's been after you for a long time , has n't he , says Johnny , his nostrils flaring red , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry is pressed into service . White king 's bishop 's pawn moves to bishop three . He 's always been after me too , says Dew , primping up hishair . Ever since that first day three years ago . The queen feels threatened . Protect her , protect her . White king 's bishop 's pawn moves to bishop four . The rook giggles . His small but shining towers shake . The foundations of the white are angry . White king 's bishop 's pawn moves to bishop five . Someone stands before me . Charlie 's coming , he says . Someone screams.  |p91I  move vertically to king six . One black pawn falls and runs away . Charlie comes . He stands before us , one half the black army . What 's going on here , he says . He 's advancing . Cut him off knight , cut him off . But no , one of our fat pawns attacks instead . He was fighting with Skinny , he says . The Charlie army , of course , pushes him easily away . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God bless him , is now getting up , attacking . It 's okay , Charlie , he says . The trouble 's over . Go back to your funny books . Okay , Joe , the black Charlie army says . I just do n't want no trouble . He retreats , he retreats . I 'm winning . The blackness moves back , disappears . Other pawns fill the vacuum , boldly waiting , hovering . You do n't look so well , Timmy , says my good king who I love . Your head is turning purple . I 'm all right king . We 've lost and won a battle , I say before the darkness comes on like crazy . I awake in an ocean of sheets . I can feel every drop on my body magnifying the king sitting beside me . Timmy , he says . How do you feel now . What happened , I say.  |p92You  passed out , Joe says . I was talking to you and you fell right on the floor . I tried to tell them to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were the boss on this ward , I say . I am , Timmy . But if I went too far I would n't be any longer . They 'd break me like they broke Gig . He was sort of like you when he first came in only older and farther on the way . But I promise you one thing . I 'll never let you down as I did him . They 'll never lay a hand on you again . Thankyou , Joe , I say and go back to sleep . Lunch is brought to me by servants of course . So is supper . The good king stops in now and then with his queen and bishop . My room becomes a sort of open house and I love it . It seems as though the black army has cowered in an office of shame . They do n't surrender completely because in the emptinessbetween God and King there are too many who do n't believe in either . Since I believe in both that naturally makes me the low pawn to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too hard . I 'll go back to sleep . The pawn awakes . The game begins again . The key hittingmy door lock sounds like a cannon shot . Someone hesitatesbehind it , walks to the next and unlocks it , and to the next and the next . It 's a good thing he walked away , I think to myself , dropping the broken piece of bedspring . For a second I think of picking it up again and giving the roachesp93something to eat besides dust but then I think of how I 'm more afraid of roaches than of life and also I think of the revenge I want so bad . My mind and eyes open all the way . I begin to see things clearly . The damp sheets that suffocate my body are thrown off . I look to the wall . Below crack six the dirty gray of the town has become a city with smokestacks that tell the sun it 's no longer needed . A river without ducks divides the city as I without shame plan to divide the ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door , move down the hallway to the bathroom where I wash in a sink and comb my hair in the metal mirror . I go to the dayroom . The chairs and tables are already set up for breakfast . Someone has mopped and waxed and buffed the floor tiles and they gleam under the light of the wired ceiling bulbs and becauseof the little sunlight that filters through the barred and wired windows some of the tiles look cleaner than others . In back of me some locked-up nut screams because he ca n't play today . To the right of me six gray pawns of unknownloyalty chatter , stare , and chatter . To the left of me a fat one begins a scream but is punched in the stomach by a smiler . Other tables to the right and the left contain smilers , laughers , criers , talkers , gods , pawns , things who wait . One god stands up . I am He , he shouts . So am I , you bastard , I think to myself . Someone next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him laughs , frowns , moves away , moves back . The god sits down and reconsiders . A table away and one nut further to the king one man 's mouth pours out a wash of words that end with his wrinkled face looking like the grate of an overflowing sewer . The man next to him does what no man should ever do to another and his face too becomes wet and ugly . Two walls to the king and where they meet he and his army sit , silent , hating , wanting to be nothing else but silent and hating . Around them , their backs to an unbreakable wall , the obviouslycrazy sit , while as always the more normal of them , the ones who can see and hear , watch the leader 's table , watch and wait . The walls their backs touch are the kind of gray , like their faces , that water only adds to . The dark white ceiling hangs above them like the gloom they would feel even if it was n't there . Someone screams from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is stopped . It 's nice to have friends . I go over to my table . The five are happy to see me . Sit down , Tim , Joe says . Things are going to be better from now on . Yes sir , I think to myself . Things certainly are , yes sir . Are you feeling better now , Dew says , after I 've sat down , his veined hand on my pajama sleeve . Thankyou , yes , I say.  |p95We  're standing behind you , the Johnny knight says in the one word type of sentence that only a white knight should use . But do n't get too close , I think to myself . We wo n't let him hurt you again , the ugly bishop says . You 're one of us now . The rook giggles . The king says something but before I can hear I think to myself , the more I learn the more I know that I do n't want to learn any more . You do n't have to be bothered by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told Charlie that you 're important . He may be sicker but he 's bigger and smarter than Skinny . From now on until you leave there wo n't be any problems . Thankyou , Joe , I say . Thankyou , king , I think to myself . But more 's to be done . Your kingdom still is threatened as is your pretty queen , your silly church , the crazy walls of your rook . The walls open a little . Yes , yes , says Gig . No one can hurt any of us . The walls open a little . The food cart clangs in , its cereal and coffee and whatever else sneaking through the metal tops and spoiling the cleanness of the chessboard . Change places with him , Gig , Joe says . Gig gets up . I get up . We change chairs . The arm of the king goes around me . You sit by me from now on , he says . I now make you second-in-command until you go . The rook giggles . The lowest pawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steamy covers of several pans of slop . Table by table the men get up and pass to get their trays and have them filled and sit again . Our table , unlike a king 's , is last . The king leads , his peoplefollow , the lowest of all pawns gets on his tray the last of the slop , and also the only smile to be given from the boy helper . The biggest of all the fuck-you smiles is returned and at the table every bit of cereal , prunes , and bread is eaten . You 're looking much better , Joe says . In a couple of days your head will lose that purple color . Thankyou , I say , and drink the last of the coffee I 've always hated . You 'll be better soon as we all will and he 'll never touch you again without his legs and arms being broken , the ugly bishop says , spitting into his prunes . The lowest pawn of all glows from the light of his loyal army . The king becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie comes in with his wet rags and hands them out to both sides . This is his most important duty of the day and he is as solemn as if he were handing out weapons . We all stack our trays on the cart and clean our tables . Skinny comes in with keys jangling like broken kettledrums . He unlocks the main door and any food carrying tourists are deported.  |p97We  clear the board of tables and chairs . The black pawns , the smilers , criers , laughers , screamers , go to the chair section . The white army with a few quiet pawns go to the table side of the board . Charlie commands somebody to collect the rags and wash them in the bathroom and goes back , I guess to his comics . Skinny waits for a while in the doorway to glare at all the men breaking his rules by sitting on and under the tables . He starts to say something but does n't and goes back to the office to answera phone call . The board is set . I begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say to everyone . We wait for lunch , he says . Would n't it be nice if we had a radio , I say . Yes I suppose so , Joe says . Oh , that would be nice , Dew says , fixing his hair where some pawn had messed it with a kiss . I have n't heard any music or news since the old one broke down a few months ago , Kirk says . Every ward in the hospital has a new one , I say , trying not to stare at the bishop 's face . Is that so , says Johnny . I do n't know why we ca n't have one . I never thought about it , says Joe . But Timmy 's right . We should have one . The next time I see my doctor I 'll ask him about that , says Kirk.  |p98When  was the last time , I say . Six months ago , I think , says Kirk . I guess he does n't like to look at me . Mine loves to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more than just look but he has n't called me for a long time either . The others laugh . We should all see our doctors more often , I say . Yes we should , Joe says . But I guess they 're overworked . We sit and wait and talk and wait . Skinny comes out . He tells one of our pawns to scrub the bathroom . He stares at me in hatred . Joe stares back at him for me . Skinny again starts to say something but Kirk 's stare makes him decide not to and he goes away . The one in the locked room screams . One of the black pawns begins to babble about some god that had long ago forgottenhim . The fat pawn who likes to scream bangs his head against the wall . This gives him a reason for screaming . No one looks at him except me and one other pawn who laughs , hits him in the face , and begins to babble about another god who laughs and hates almost as much as he . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to talk of them so often , I think to myself . Maybe it 's because their gods never talk of them . Better to pray to the walls . Since the attendants never listen , the walls seem to be the only logical authority . And most of all they 're always there . And they never close in , these god-walls . They stay the same which is worse . They keep us inp99darkness to hide us from other gods . The sun coming through the bars of a window goes to full strength yet the lights are kept on because of the darkness . Cruel and jealous gods , I think to myself , going to the one window that 's partly open . I have but One and I sure wish He 'd talk to me a little more often . Far beyond the bars and the green-painted wire screening I see a green lawn and a building and in back of it a dirt baseballfield where two kids are playing a different kind of game . Beyond them is a water pipe where three old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmly dressed . I did n't realize it was so cold out . Beyond them is a neat orchard of fruit trees with leaves that are turning yellow and red . Beyond that I ca n't see but I think there is a road and a town and real people doing real things . Maybe not . Maybe the orchard spreads around the world and ends behind me . Maybe this hospital is the only place where people sit and wait . But I do n't really care . The world for me is now one skinny attendant and how I can hurt him . I go back to the tables . Do you know , I say to Joe and Dew with several pawns overhearing , that most wards have ping-pong tables and card games going and chess and checkerboards . Do you know that some even have television sets . Lunch comes . Pieces of carrots float in a container of green soup . Black and white potato slices compare worm wounds with cucumber bits . I had this awful operation , one ' tater saysp100to a cuke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cuts into me as if he could n't care less . Oh but look at my scar , says the cuke . They kept it and threw the rest away . It should n't happen to a turnip , says the ' tater . Unwashed wagon with brown liquid jumping away from the meat and running back to apologize . Sickly looking grass salad with milky dressingbeing cheered up by cold coffee . Thick slices of crumbling bread stacked next to dented tin bowls of brown peaches and wrinkled prunes . Jangling spoons with hard crusted memories of morning 's meal . My friend the kitchen man who serves me with the same enthusiasm as the others . The boy with him who picks his pimples over the peaches . After eating we clean up , sit , and talk . Do any of the wards have women attendants or nurses on them , Johnny says to me . Most do , I say . I would n't like that , Dew says . Do they ever wash you or feed you like they once done me in another place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us funny . He knows I 'm about to lie and does n't know why but he says nothingso I go ahead . Yes , I say . If you do n't want to do it yourself you just ask . And some wards really have television , Kirk says . Yes , I say . The lucky ones do . Supper comes . Dead hamburger , tear-sogged toast , white onion layers , Bible-black prunes . After eating we clean up , sit , and talk . Are any of the women pretty , Johnny says . Do they ever walk around with the men . Yes , I say . Even some crazy ones are free . And not just on the grounds either . And do they ever hold hands , says Gig , the two of his rubbing together , lis/tening . Yes , I say . Especially in the tunnel and in the Sweet Shoppe . Are there other pretty ones like you out there , says Dew , his eyelashes fluttering like wings over dead eyes . The others take the question as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between some and others . Yes , I say . The boys and the girls walk around free . Did they really put you here because a friend of yours died , says Kirk . Yes , I say . I got very scared . Friends of mine die a little each day , Kirk says . I still scare them more than they scare me . Did you love your friend , Dew says . Yes , I say . In the way my dog loved me when I was punished for something I did n't do . Then you did n't sleep with him , Dew says . I look at Dew and I start to say , of course not . But instead I say , my dog slept with me , and then I lie , and I would 've with him if he 'd asked . But he did n't so I did n't . They all look at me , especially Joe , in the same curious way they would look at the sickest of our ward saying somethingnormal or the most normal of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe laughs . The others along with a few pawns follow him and every head in the room turns to stare or laugh at the normal ones acting crazy . I slept with my dog once , Gig says . But my father got jealous and threw us both out . We all laugh again even though we 've heard it before . Our laughter is echoed by any others who are n't busy cryingor thinking of a new scream . The echo lasts long after we 've started the next joke . In bed with the covers over my eyes I think of Cindy.  |p102When  her small naked body begins to blur in my mind , and she changes into a hag or a naked old man , I forget the real world and pray . When you 're the lowest pawn of all there is nothing to do but this and go to sleep so I do . In the morning the keys walk down the hall saying hello to every door . When they come to mine I wait holding the piece of bedspring but nothing happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the others . Oh no , I think to myself . He 's going to leave me locked in today and maybe from now on . My door opens . Joe walks in . Good morning , Timmy , he says . I 've fixed your lock with paper so it wo n't open unless I jiggle it with a piece of wire . And the laundry just came in . Here 's the smallest pants and shirt I could find , he says , throwing a gray uniform on my bed . Before you try them on why do n't you take a shower . I 'll stand guard to make sure no one bothers you . Thankyou very much , Joe , I say , taking the shirt and smelling its disinfected cleanness . And if they 're too big for you I 'll try to find you some smaller ones.  |p103Thankyou  , Joe , I say while getting up and going to the shower , my clean uniform under my arm . The pawn advances , clean and fresh with hair combed carefully and spit-shined slippers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . At our breakfast there is more talk than usual . Mostly about how Joe has outwitted Skinny and maybe we should fix all the locks like that , and why do n't we have the good things that other wards have . Would n't it be nice to have real mirrors instead of those metal things , I say . And would n't it be nice if we could go outsideonce in a while . Kirk and Dew say that they would n't like either change but Joe and Johnny say that things could be a little better than they are . Gig says nothing but his eyes move to the window and for a second I think I see something in his face that deservesto go outside but that look soon passes and his eyes dull again almost as much as the brain behind them . The food cart comes . I eat the watery cereal and say to Joe that in the main dining room I had all the sugar I could use and why ca n't we . He says nothing . I can tell he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little happier about it . That same fat nut at the far table screams . For some reason everyone in the room looks at him . He feels all the eyes and lowers his voice little by little until it ends in a squeak.  |p104The  wetter near him wets his pants again but does n't laugh . One god begins his usual speech but there is n't much emotion in it , mostly I guess because no one hits him . Someonelaughs , then stops . Another spits on the floor , the worst crime of all . The one who 's locked in screams because he 's hungry for food or maybe for something else . A tray at one table falls to the floor . The usual chatter of the tables slows , picks up , slows again . The fat one screams . Charlie comes out . He pulls the chair out from under the dropper and he falls to the floor , begging not to be hit . Charlie kicks him in the face . I 've never seen him do that before , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , Charlie , he says . Joe , you do n't run this ward , Charlie says , giving the man another kick . Well neither do you , my king says . And neither does Skinny . The doctors run this ward whether we ever get to see them or not , so you just stop and go get your rags . Charlie starts to come over but does n't . The dropper returnsto his chair where he sits crying and smiling at the same time . The rest of the ward sits quietly watching . Now you pick up that tray or I 'll lock you in your room , Charlie says . The man shakes his head no . Skinny comes out . What 's the problem now , he says . Charlie tells him . They pick the man up by the shoulders and drag him into the hall.  |p105Do  n't you beat him , my king shouts after them . Yeah , the bishop says . He already got kicked , is n't that enough , the knight says . He did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him alone . The rook and all the pawns stare . Skinny stops and stares back at us while Charlie takes the man down the hall to his room . You people had better quiet down , the black king says . Or else there 's going to be trouble . I 'll lock every one of you in your rooms for a week . The brave knight starts to get up but the hand of my king stops him . Skinny goes into the office . The ward becomes quiet for a while and then the chatter resumes . The time is n't yet right , I think to myself . After the usual eternity , lunch bangs through the main doors which are relocked again by Skinny . Dew , my lovely queen , goes to the cart for his tray before he 's supposed to . You just sit down and await your turn like everybody else , the black king says . What 's the difference , Dew says . Whether I 'm first or last or in between , it 's all the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the same thing day in and day out for a few thousand days . Why do n't you mind your own business anyway . P106The black king stares . What does a king say to a queen of another power . My queen gets his tray from the bottom of the cart . The rest of the ward lines up in back of him . My king and my army line up in back of them . The boy server takes off all of the covers and the little steam that 's left rises and disappears in the air . At first he does n't want to serve such a troublemaker but the kitchen man with him says it 's okay . Dew gets his tray filled with lunch and sits down , winking at me . I look at Skinny and he is looking at everyone else , daring them to say anything . My queen has won a battle , I think to myself . I bet it 's the first one in a long time . After the cart is gone and after we 've cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table places , I say to Johnny , would n't a game of cards or ping-pong be nice about now and do n't you think we deserve better meals . Joe looks at me in a funny way and I do n't think he likes me any more but it does n't matter now . There are a few comic books on our ward lent by Charlie that float among the few lucky readers . There 's one about a fox and a crow , there 's one about a rabbit named Jennifer , there are two and a half graveyard mysteries where the dead are always rising up at the command of an evil scientist to terrorizethe living . All these comics are old and torn and spottedP107by gravy and prune spit and the sweat of hundreds of fingers . The half of one mystery had long ago become a carefully guarded pile of cards with everything penciled out except the faces of the dead and Heart 3 , Spade 8 , Club 5 , and so on penciledin any space that was left . I asked for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give it to me so I told Johnny . I carefully ripped three pages apart and made with big and smaller rolled-up pieces some men of chess using light-colored ones for white and dark for black . I ripped out the back cover that advertised Christmas cards , sell one box for $3.98 and keep a dollar , and drew with my thumbnail , until I found a pencil , the sixty-four squares . Joe already knew how to play chess , how could a king not . Dew knew the moves , Johnny knew the names of the men . Gig had once known the game but had forgotten it along with everything else . For several hours I played with Joe , always letting him win , and tried to teach the others the names , the strategy , the reason for playing . No one wins except kings , I think to myself after showing Johnny the L-shaped move of the knight and losing it to a dead paper queen . And the king only gets a minute 's rest until both armies are standing again facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a god 's finger . And how does this game differ from anything else , I think while killing a pawn and being killed by a bishop . Another game is mated by the black . How excited everyone is at this new thing . Even the lowest pawns come over andp108crowd around to stare over the shoulders of my friends as other pawns move and kill and are killed for the glory of nobody except a minor god winning nothing but a move from boredom . A new game is set up . A black pawn advances . A screamer sighs . One of my white ones move . A black knight jumps . Johnny shrugs . More pawns come over to us and I feel an emptiness in back of the babbling watchers that I ca n't see . I feel that now , finally , the board is more or less set . More men on the paper are moved , killed , replaced . Skinny comes in , stands somewhere among us and watches as I skillfully lose a wall of protecting pawns . Joe 's queen moves three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dew asks a question . No , I say . The king can only move one at a time . The two queens are the only ones who can go in any direction . Why , he says . Because even though the queen is the most important only the death of the king matters . Why , he says . Because since everyone works to protect the king he is the only sane one . Oh , Dew says as I take another black pawn . That 's a silly game , with bits of paper , Skinny says . Yes , I say , looking up at him . But even if we had a real set I bet you could n't beat Joe . Joe moves another pawn threatening my queen as Skinny puts an arm around Dew , as several pawns stare with open mouths , wide eyes , spit dribbling down their chins . Kirk stands next to them . His eyes tell that he does n't care about this public handling of his queen but his face shows as muchp109hatred as if this were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose a pawn and take a bishop and listen as Skinny says , that 's a silly game and after supper I want every piece of it thrown on the rag pile . He walks away and all the pawns get closer to me . I lose a play I 'd planned but it does n't matter . I have n't played this in years , Joe says . Why do n't we carve some soap or something to get better pieces . Skinny would only take them away , I say . No he wo n't , Joe says , his eyes leaving the board for the first time . No , Kirk says . I 'd break his legs . That 's right , Dew says . And I 'd watch and laugh . He ai n't going to take nothing away , Gig says . Johnny presses his fingers against his knuckles and because of two missing fingers they crack eight times which is exactly the number of moves a knight can make . My madness has made me clever , I think to myself as my king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without looking around I can hear some pawns moving away . They must be even blacker than the two Negro nuts who stay . And even among those who stay some are shaking their heads and muttering . But they do n't really matter . What pawns ever do . The fat one is starting to scream . Go ahead fatty . You deserve it . You have n't had so much tension since one of the gods dropped his bowl of hot soup down your pants . But he does n't scream . He 's changed his empty mind because one of the politicians is now outshouting everyone with a speech about diapers and how if everyone had them the world would n't be so shitty.  |p110Su|p|per  bangs in , is slopped on trays , is swallowed , is collectedby hungry porcelain gods who roar and gurgle with wet thanks but would throw up if a nice apple were fed them . Lips and fingers after years of being shown how are dipped under cold faucets and wiped with toilet paper . Noses are blown in that same harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the paper is thrown to the floor where a cigarette-paid flunky scoops them up , examines each one carefully , and puts them into the cardboard barrel by the radiator . After the last flushing and the last mopping and during the washing of the rags , all the inmates quiet and surround the table on which Joe and I have agreed to play the championshipof all the paper championship games . One piece is missing even before we begin . No matter . Dew , I say . Please hand me a piece of that toilet paper . Thankyou . This is a white pawn , I say , rolling it up , putting it in the cavity between the pawns on my side and wiping my fingers on my pants . You move first , Joe says . I move . He moves . I move . Charlie comes in . Joe moves . I move . Skinny joins us . Joe moves . I move . Skinny looks angry but so does Kirk so who cares . Joe moves . I move . Some pawn hiccups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get my queen past his defense but take a fourth so as to put her in the line of his . A pawn to my left laughs half under his breath without knowing why . A pawn in back of me grips my forbidden chair . Joe looks backp111to the paper , concentrates for long minutes . I do n't get this game , Charlie says , his large empty face hanging over Dew 's shoulder . Shut up , Skinny says . I told you people I wanted those papers in the rags . Go away , Joe says , without looking up , taking another stupid move . You give me those papers , Skinny shouts , moving his hands toward our game . No , Johnny says , grabbing one of the thin arms of the black king . Skinny pulls away saying all the dirty words he can think of and goes to his office before Johnny can grab again . Some of the pawns leave the game . The ones who stay chatter and shake their heads . Shut up , Gig says . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join his king . I move . Joe moves . My king is in danger . All eyes stare at one Christmas-cardad with penciled squares as if it were the only battle in the world . It is not the only battle in the world , I think to myself . Every one of us has our own . The only defeat is not to fight . I remember a spider in a bottle . I defend with a pawn . The one in back of me breathes prune stink down my neck . I remember how it killed the bugs not because it was bigger but because it was smarter and faster . My pawn is taken . As I planned my defense is broken and dying . And also I remember it killed because it was cornered by a buzzing intruder that was pulling my house apart and I remember the mother voice screaming at me and breaking my jar on a rock and hitting me and cookingchicken and bread to make stuffing and all the bugs at the table eating goodbye to me but never saying so and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I stuffed myself on a chicken friend but it did n't help because sick or not I still had to go to a granma who did n't want me and ... . Checkmate . I lost . All the pawns roar with happy laughter . Checkmate , Joe says again as if not believing his first words . I 'm still the winning king . Yes , Joe , I say . But of what . The paper board is folded around the pieces . Someone 's spare sock swallows tomorrow 's fun and is hid under a radiator . As if it were a tossed pool rock all the pawns ripple away and begin their madness that was for a while forgotten . That was a good game , Joe says . I must learn how to play it , Dew says . Me too , Johnny says . I 'll teach you both , I say . As long as Skinny does n't stop us . Do n't worry about him , says Gig . He knows his place . I 'll be right back , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office without looking in . The bathroom is empty which is the way I like it . The shower faucet is dripping . The drops hold meetings on the cement and after every fifth one is introduced they decide to trickle down the drain . One of the toilets is running . A cockroach falls six thousand feet from the ceiling , gets up , and begins the climb again . I unzip , pee , zip , start to leave . Skinny is in the doorway . I stop and stare . He stares back . I feel more alone with him than Ip113ever felt in the room alone . I 'm scareder than I 've ever been before . You 're making trouble on my ward , he says . If you do n't stop I 'll fix you good . I 'll make it so you 'll never get out of here . I feel like that bug in the bottle . I begin to feel sweat in the way that bug must have felt the cold wet web . I never realized it before but Skinny has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a spider on a spider . He walks toward me slowly . For a few seconds I feel like using my defense feeling again where my eyes and mind blur , my mouth screams , my hands hit anything close , but then I think , what good would it do . I 'd only be locked up again and eaten every morning by the spider king and the only defense then would be to die and I do n't want to do that . So I stand and wait and hope that the quick mouth of Tim will find a way out . For once it does n't . Do n't try to con me you sick little punk , he says , hitting me in the face . I 'm going to lock you in your room forever , he says , punching me again and again until I fall to the floor . I feel like begging but I do n't , I feel like fighting but I ca n't . He starts to kick me and all I can do is hope he stops . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I taste a pouring of blood . It 's then I decide to use my only defense but before I can a voice shouts from the doorway , forever forever forever . Towering somewhere above me and over my kicker 's head , a small hand owned by Gig the rook grabs into the hair of the black king and holds him away from my pain and looks atP114him in the way a bug must look at a dying spider . Slam , against the wall , knocking down the cockroach the spider king goes , tries to get up , decides to pass out instead . My dear rook goes over to him to show him what feet feel like and I 'm sorry he ca n't feel them . I go into the hallway , trying to think , using my arm to tell the blood to stop but it does n't listen . Gig followsme . I bump into Charlie . Hey , what 's going on here , where 's Skinny , he says . He stuck his head in a toilet , I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . I try to think of an answer but before I can my dear rook takes the second half of the black army and ruins it against a wall in the same way the pocket of a white shirt gets ruined by an overheated red pen . I run into the dayroom . One step beyond the doorway I see and feel and hear my eyes and ears bleeding with all the revolt against boredom I 'd worked for . Screams of vengeance and mercy and something to do , laughing and crying red blurs like headless roaches , chairs flying , table legs breaking heads of gods , politicians , pissers , laughers , screamers , shitters , losers . Joe comes up to protect me . Before he can ask what happened , a chair hits his head and I laugh . I laugh again while moving against a wall as I see the bishop putting his fingers into the hitter 's eyes so deep he ca n't get them out . I laugh again when Johnny hits the fat screamer as hard as he can but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh again when some queen is caught by three black pawns who get even with years of unwanted ruling by pushing and pulling the bloody ends of chair pieces in and out of his face . I laugh again when thep115smell of burnt flesh reaches nostrils that have smelled worse . I laugh again when something hits my back but I stop when the pain doubles me to the floor . When I look up trying not to scream I see Joe 's bloody face looking down at me , begging me to get up , putting keys in my hand , saying , now you see why we 're locked up here . You do n't belong here with us . You 're a good boy . You get the hell out of here and go over to the boys ' ward where you belong but do n't say I sent you . I unlock and go out the main door and lock it again and cry myself down the hall until the pain in my back hurts so bad I have to sit down on the cold tile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Its outstretched wings and red head make it look for a second like a Jap zero in a movie . It swoops to gobble a tiny pair of white powdery wings and turns in a graceful arc to try to catch another . The mate of the eaten felt only the rush of the wind which blew it beneath the limb of a tree . The bird lands on the limb to look for the lost meal and then farts . The butterfly screams . One million years to chip away the uselessness from the first ax and less than one eight-hundredth of that time to begin the end of everything . One soggy split second to be born and fourteen years ... mommy and daddy , school and Sundayp116school , aunts and uncles and granmas and foster parents and hundreds of friends and girl friends and . . . the screaming and the screaming and the pounding and the stink of dozens and maybe millions of caged animals . Well you can just take back your fourteen years I do n't want them any more I have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they want me to be so that 's what I 'll be . . . . A schoolyard in winter . The little puddles of ice crackle when I walk on them . There 's a playground ahead with swings and slides and a little wooden merry-go-round . Two little girls are holding onto its rails for dear life and squealing with laughter as some big kid runs with the merry-go-round making it go faster , faster . I stand and wait a while and soon the big kid gets tired and goes away . When the spinning has slowed enough one of the girls says goodbye to the other and hops off and follows . The girl who 's left is very pretty . Her legs are bare but she wears a heavy coat . She sits with her eyes closed as if she were pretending to be on a fast jet rather than a slowing down merry-go-round or as if she were praying . I look around to make sure that we 're alone and then go over to her . The spinning slows to a stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get her second leg over I grab at the rail a few feet away and begin to push . Within seconds I 'm running as fast as I can taking her and the whole world with me straddling the rail and yelling to please stop she has to go home please please . After six or seven times around I have to stop to catch my breath . Around and around she flies past with her hair blowing in the wind and herp117eyes closed and her teeth clenched and her hands turning white on the rail . Long seconds circle by . Little by little the merry-go-round slows down enough for her to try to get off . But she 's so dizzy she does n't know which way to go . I go over to help her but she 's mad at me and yells at me to keep away and she gets her other leg over the rail but is still too dizzy to jump down so I try to help her again but she slaps at me and I get mad and grab both her ankles above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head hits the rail and she screams and falls to the dirt and I pull on her ankles and lift her high in the air her feet over my head and she keeps screamingand I hold her legs far apart and her coat and dress fall over the butterfly face and I make a wish and pull as hard as I can and there 's a loud crack at the crotch beneath her panties . A door closes . They did n't say goodbye , they never do . Well at least he 's stopped moaning anyway , a man 's voice says . When he wakes up he 'll be all right . But how in the world could he have stayed on that terrible ward for a whole month without anyone knowing about it , a woman 's voice says . Doctor Glucken knew about him being there , the man says . But that attendant , the one who died in the fire during the riot , he added twenty years to the kid 's age each time he made out a report and that senile old Glucken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own age now , the woman says . He 'll soon forget.  |p118Footste|ps  down a hall . Who 's she talking about . Glucken or me . If all the Gluckens in the world were dead there 'd be about six people left . Fucken Glucken . What else did they say . Skinny died . Oh no , my God no , that ca n't be ... . I 'm three . I 'm in a toy store with mommy where she 's trying to get a job . I want a dolly , mommy , I say . Boys do n't play with dolls , she says . You want to be called a sissy . I scream so loud that everyone stops to look , even people out on the street , and when I see them looking I stop and mommy hits me and I start again . I hate hate hate hate and she does n't particularly like me much either . I 'm ten . It 's Sunday morning and granma is on her favorite subject . You are the laziest boy I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shined your shoes or brushed your pants yet like I told you and your room 's a mess no wonder no one likes you or wants to play with you now get in there and clean up your room and shine your shoes and brush your pants and get a smaller knot in that tie you 've been taught a thousand times that 's not the way to tie a tie if you do n't have enough sense to get any friends you could at least try to get God to like youp119though I do n't know how He could ever like such a lazy boy now do n't back-talk to me and hurry up it 's getting late . I do all those silly things except the tie because I just ca n't remember how it goes . I sneak out which is n't easy and on the way to Sunday school I think about how much I hate granma and just about everybody else too . I make sure my fly is closed and squirm on the seat while listening to the teacher tell us of the goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by obey obey obeying and being good good good . What does she know about being good , the old bag . She never has a good word for anybody except Jesus yet expectsus to love everybody and obey her and be good little boys and girls . The meek shall inherit the earth , she says . I caught her crying one day just before classes and laughed right in her wet face . I often dream about that laugh . That laugh was a little thing really , a cruel and revengeful thing , but like a little piece of soap it got together in my memorywith lots of other little things and in spite of my going from house to house like a salesman who could n't sell anything it gradually cleansed me of hating or being cruel back . Of course it made me different and no one likes anyone who 's different but I guess I did want God to like me after all . I 'm twelve and my tie is perfectly tied . The Firebird is beingplayed at the wrong speed on Patrick Manley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because his mother is n't home . Patrick Manley is very stupid . Usually we sit aroundp120arguing about who is the loneliest and unhappiest but not today . We sit and stare at this new toy with its strange music going through our heads and bodies as if it were a hot day and we were sitting in a cold pool drinking cold lemonade . It is beautiful to share something with somebody even if it is only with stupid Patrick Manley . It 's a cheap machine quite unlike the doctor 's . There is only one red button . Do n't know what it 's for . . . . like a huge bonfire . . . . two circles of brown halfnakedgypsies dancing around it . . . . the night is blue and happy . . . . the air is electric . . . . he takes down his pants and I take down my pants . . . . and his stupid mother walks in . The next day I hit him in the mouth and he cried and I was sorry . A week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another aunt who did n't want me either so she drove me to another granma who was too old so a third aunt took me in for a while and then I was adopted and then ... . I never really had hundreds of friends and girl friends in fact I did n't have any and it was really me on that merry-goround . . . . A schoolyard in winter . The little puddles of ice crackle when I walk on them . There 's a playground ahead with swings and slides and a little wooden merry-go-round . I love that merry-go-round . Especially when there 's some little kids on it and they ask me to push it for them . They always ask the big kids to push them but when they ask me I pretend that I 'm the only one and that they do so because I 'm the biggest and the fastest . Two girls from the second or third grade are on itp121now . I go over and they ask me to push them and I do and when I 've got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it . The two girls laugh and squeal with pleasure and I laugh too . Around and around we go and if I close my eyes I can pretend I 'm a bird or a jet or a spaceship or I can pretend that nothing 's real and I do n't exist . Around and around we go and when I open my eyes there is in a split second of each time around a blurred vision of two big seventh graders in front of me . It 's one of the punks from the sixth grade , one says . And he 's bothering the little kids , the other one says . The two girls giggle . Let 's teach him a lesson , one says . Yeah , the other one says . We do n't like bullies around here . I was n't doing anything , I say on one of the trips around . But they do n't listen . They start to push and we go faster and faster . The two little girls are in the middle where the speed is slow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get so frightened I begin to yell , please please I have to go home , but they run with me as fast as they can and then stand back to catch their breath and watch . After many times around it begins to slow and I think about jumping off but I 'm so dizzy I ca n't tell how fast the ground is going or how much it 'll hurt if I hit it . Finally it slows almost to a stop and I get ready to jump down but one of the big kids puts his arms around me and his hands on the rail in back of me so I ca n't get off and says , give me a kiss sweetie , and the other kid laughs and I try to push the arms away so I can get off and go home but he gets mad and grabs my ankles and I fall backwardand hit my head on the rail and scream and fall to thep122dirt and when I try to get up the other kid comes over to help the first and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are swinging in the air and I 'm screaming and they begin to pull on my legs and the pain is so great I begin to think I 'm being split apart but I scream so loud they decide not to but to drop me instead and run away and as I 'm all huddled up on the ground I see one of the little girls running after them but the other one coming over to me and kneeling beside me to help and I grab at her and tear a button off her coat and she begins to cry and she too runs away and in spite of the pain I 'm sorry I made her cry . The meek shall inherit little pieces of soap that barely makes them not to want to crack the crotch of another except in dreams . The meek shall inherit the job of a salesman selling nothing . The meek shall inherit merry-go-rounds and car rides and enough shit , pain , and loneliness until it comes out of their ears . The meek shall inherit no memories of laughter unless it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and no memories of friends unless they die and no memories of girl friends except for those who let their pink pajamas fall to their ankles in a nut house and no memories of what she looked like because although she too was too meek to try and stop the machineit happened too fast . The meek shall inherit the wrath of the machine and the animal stink and screaming of the mindlessit caused and bars and bricks and wire screening .... and a yellow bird that flies out of the fucking sun.  |p123I  know what I 'll do . I 'll stop all thoughts and movements and become a vegetable , a blob , a big hunk of nothing , a zero , a rotting , stinking , unknowing , uncaring piece of flesh and hair . . . starting right now I 'll never again be . It did n't work did it . Nothing ever does . Ddiiaarryyyyyy  --  44 Rebmeced  --  Blue **25;10740;TOOLONG they gather when Glucken lets them now and then in doorway to stare at blue nut . . . . that 's meee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue pawn 's nurse gave meee when the blue cloud is n't in my mind and when it is and I ca n't I 'll make up songs and write them down later when most of the blue has gone awayyyyy . The blue cloud is slowly changing to gold because of those silly lights they always put up at night . Damnit , now I 'll have to change the first page . It 's so hard to write anything because my back hurts so much from where somebody hit me and I ca n't sit up . Mister Hood is my new attendant . He 's very nice . He only comes in to bring my meals and change my tub . How are you this morning , lazybones , he says . Are you feeling any better . Yes , I say.  |p124Here  let me help you up a little , he says , pulling on my pillow and lifting me up . Thankyou , I say . Want me to feed you , he always says . No thankyou , I say . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap , we never did find those keys you let yourself out with . Did you throw them out of a window . I must look awful scared after he says this because he steps back and says , do n't you worry about it , Timmy . You just rest now . You can tell me whenever you want to . You know , we are all very grateful to you for locking that door behind you . It would have been a terrible thing if those men had gotten out . . I stare at him . He leaves . That 's all there is to it . He does n't even try to ... . D D t A R R Y Y-Ced.5-My back hurts bad but Mister Hood says that 's a good sign but I wonder what if it broke in half would we have a party . The blue is lighter but still very pretty and I 'm beginning to see some furniture but I ca n't think of any songs . Sorry . I put my pad away because the blue cloud is suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and it 's so beautiful . There is a drop of water somewhere . Maybe it 's falling down a blade of grass or maybe it 's rising on the end of my prick , I do n't know . It does n't matter where it is . The important thing is that by looking at it with my special eyes I can see all thep125truth and beauty that everyone has always tried to hide from me . The blurred mystery of all time dissolves into a clear precisepicture . There is in that drop a small universe where a trillion trilliongalaxies swirl in black skies with all their suns and moons and planets trailing like dust . In every drop of water it is the same , even in the drops that fall down the blades of grass on those planets or rise on the pricks of the people on those planets . Like a mirror in front of a mirror it never ends unless someone steps on the blade , drops the mirror , or buttons up . Our own universe is merely a drop to some unsuspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger . In all things , wood , hair , iron , lies , anger , there are others and others and others and in each there are people who think they 're alone . Deeper into truth with all my mind forgetting I fall upwardin the blue cloud of God and I hear again the Firebird and the bonfires are real and the machine is burning and the enemies of the machine are sucking out my back pain and spitting it out in tiny golden drops where the lovers of the machine and the causers and the makers of the machine are doomed to dwell in hell forever and now the meek is inheriting and that teacher was right and the reason she cried was because she doubted for a second and oh Lord I 've cried but I 've never doubted and I thank Thee it 's so beautiful and I never want to come out and look birds of every color ever thought of except yellow are rainingup and down and all the naked girls and some boys too are dancing and inviting me to dance with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer and I feel so wonderful to inherit His presence and there He is now all golden blue dazzlingly so and full of love and lovely . . . . but no .... it ca n't be . . . . it 's only that stupid Patrick Manley . Please God , wherever You are , I want to go back . Please . Please . I must , I must .... Owww my back hurts so much . DIARY y  --  December 8  --  boys ' building  --  Mister Hood says I went into a coma for two days . I wonder if a coma is the same as a comma . My back hurts a lot and my head feels funny and I wish they 'd give me a toothbrush because I 'm getting one heck of a toothache . Welcome back to reality . I 'll end my diary for today now because I do n't think reality is as nice as the other . I may be in reality but I 'm not well yet . I know this becauseMister Hood does n't let me leave the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door but did n't watch . I also know I 'm not well yet because of the blurs that stand in the doorway and speak to me and laugh and get mad when I do n't answer . There are dozens of different blurs or maybe there 's just one who 's very talented . Some are fat . Some are skinny . Some are pimply faced nose pickers and others are clearly a part of the machine . Most just open my door and stare for a while and then close it and walk away . Some ask me stupid questions such as , why were you on a violentward and what was it like , or , what makes you so special , or , why do n't you get out of bed and play a game of ping-pongp127with me , or , hey crazy boy how come they promoted you to us , or , you sure talked enough in your sleep a couple of nights ago why do n't you ever want to talk to any of us do you think you 're too good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me yesterday do you ever get any visitors , or , why do n't they let you come to the dining room with the rest of us and boy your pot sure stinks . Supper comes and goes . My window blackens . My door opens . I expect another kid with more silly questions . Instead , a blur of an arm without a body sticks through . Another blur appears and pours something over the arm and lights a match . The black hair burns in a blue flame and goes out . Both laugh and disappear . Another blur in a white sheet jumps in the doorway and cackles like an old woman . A mattress flops against the doorway and covers it and I become scared but it goes away and I squint my eyes and three blurred faces stare out of the darkness making faces and noises and it 's then I realize I 'm not dreaming again but that the boys are putting on a show for me in the only way they know how and I become happier than I 've ever been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a naked butt sticking out on one side and lots of laughter . It goes and is replaced by more blurred faces on both sides and even a couple on the floor . All the faces make faces and laugh and giggle and shout and for the first time in a long time I sit up and laugh and they seem pleased . From down the hall Mister Hood ends the fun by yellingp128lights out time for bed come on you guys let 's hit the sack . My door closes and everyone in the hall scrambles for their rooms and the lights go out and there 's chattering for a while and a flushing of toilets but soon all noise ends except my excitedbreathing . Imagine that . I actually have friends here . I 'm not alone any more . Now there is only the pale bathroom light shining through the porthole in my door . I begin to fall asleep while listening to the far-off screams of others in other buildings . I fall sleep listening to noises in the hall and then I wake up when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stand staring . One lights a match and again a blue flame erupts on an arm but this time the whole world lights up and when it goes out I ca n't see a thing . I feel the bed by my feet sink a little as someone sits down . Hello , Timmy . My name is Darrell , the sitter says . Slowly the blackness goes away and I see him . He is about seventeen and is good-looking in the way of an ancient Roman officer in a history book . He has shiny black hair and the kind of chiseled face that demands to be looked at . And this arm-burning nut here is Big Jim , he says . He 's the leader of a little club we have here called the Mafia . I 'm second-in-command . There 's a few rules I think you should know about if you want to stay healthy . Rules , I say . Yeah , the standing one says . There 's lots of rules you got to learn to stay healthy.  |p129Big  Jim looks older and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that book . He reminds me of the machine brute who is always outsmarted by us Romans but never defeated because he 's too big and too many . Can I join the club , I say . That 'll come later , Darrell says . First you got to know the rules . Okay , I say . Number one is that you have to do anything and everything the club tells you . Okay , I say . Number two is that you must never squeal on anyone for doing anything , under penalty of death . Okay , I say , half-believing him because I believe he believes it . Number three . You must get out of bed as soon as you can , like tomorrow , because if you want to join our club you 'll have to go through an initiation period and we ca n't wait forever . Okay . He smiles and puts a hand on my leg . Suddenly I like him very much . You know , he says , we do n't let crazy boys in our club . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're crazy like the rest of them you better tell us now and if you lie and we find out later we 'll carry you to the ball field and strip you naked and beat you black and blue and leave you there.  |p130I  'm not , I say , and then wish I 'd had a longer time to think about it . You was in building K was n't you , Big Jim says . Yes , I say . But I was only there for one month and I was sent by mistake . Darrell 's hand tightens on my leg . I 've already warned you not to lie , he says . But I 'm not lying , I say . A friend of mine died in building B and I sort of had a nervous breakdown so they sent me to K and then there was a riot so they sent me here . Why were you brought here in the first place , Darrell says , and I 'm glad his strong fingers are now rubbing instead of squeezing . My adopted parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phony doctor to have me committed , I say , remembering for the first time in a long time that I have n't really been here all my life . I 'm in because I 'm crazy , Darrell says . But I 'm smart crazy like a mixed-up fox . This building and the girls ' building and the three in back of us where the little kids stay is different from the rest because we also have the label of an observation centeron us . Did you know that . No , I say . Do you know what it means . I 'm not sure , I say . It means we 're still young enough to be observed . The ones in the other buildings are never seen . You 're lucky youp131got out in time and over to us before you became one of them . Yes I am , I say . I 'm in here because my mother stuck a salad knife in my father 's throat while we were all sitting at the table eating spaghetti . When he fell in his plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a movie . When they locked her up they decided to put me away too for a while . It was a good movie actually but they did n't seem to want to hear about it . Tell him about me , Big Jim says . Would you like to hear what our chief nut did to get in here , Darrell says . Yes , I say , thinking that maybe they like me and oh God I hope they do . He 's an S and M , Darrell says . Do you know what that means . No , I say . It means that above all he 's a sadist and a masochist . Just for the record he 's also a paranoiac schizophrenic and manic depressive . Besides that he 's nuts . He likes to torture young boys and he likes to be tortured . Unfortunately his only masochisticpleasure is in pouring lighter fluid on his arms and lighting it . Even the hair seems to enjoy it because it always grows back in a few days . But the sadistic side of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about , Big Jim says . I 'm merely telling our new friend that your S is more than your M. It 's true is n't it . P132Huh , yeah I guess so , Big Jim says . See , I told you , Darrell says . What did he do , I say , not knowing what the big words meant . For years he was the terror of his grade school , Darrell says . The biggest kind of bully . He would beat up the kids and the teachers and even the other bullies . But no one ever complaineduntil one day he took this young kid to his cellar and made him go down on him . When the kid had finished and had started throwing up all over the place our big brave chief decided that he too wanted a little taste . But fortunately for us and unfortunately for the poor kid Big Jim decided in his little mind that he wanted more than just dick . He beat the kid senseless and then began to eat him . Unfortunately the kid woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Big Jim 's mother heard the scream and came down the steps and then ran up again to call the cops . At least that 's the way he told me . Yeah , Big Jim says . See I told you , Darrell says . Why is he the leader , I say . Why not , Darrell says . Somebody 's got to be . And besides he 's the roughest boy on our ward and probably in the whole place . That 's right , Big Jim says . See I told you , Darrell says . And he can beat me up but because he 's also the stupidest I can always talk him out of it so IP133do n't worry . I can beat anybody else on the ward and Corky , he 's a junky and third-in-command , he can beat anyone under him and Barney , he 's one of our two niggers , he 's fourth and can beat the rest and it goes on and on all the way down the line to some little punk named Muriel . What I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house is like a chicken coop . Every chicken can and has the right to peck all the ones under him . This is the theory of our Mafia and in fact that of the outside and we must n't stray too far from the outside because it 's the ones who live there who observe us . Do you get me so far . Yes , I say , not being sure . But what about the attendants . We have three , Darrell says . Mister Hood is big and stupid and does what we say . Jake is an old drunk who comes only on Saturdays . He 's scared to death of us . The third is a young colored guy who hates us but ca n't do anything about us becausewe once caught him in the john with one of the punks and he 's afraid we 'll tell a doctor and that the doctor might put him in with us . And I 'd sure like that , Big Jim says . I 'd take him to the ball field and strip him buck naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his S side again , Darrell says . It gets real complicatedwhen he finds someone he likes . I hope you never find out what he enjoys doing best . I sit and stare at the smiling Roman and know he 's being friendly but at the same time I realize I do n't know anything at all and never did . I look at Big Jim and he looks like a Hun or maybe the devil or maybe the machine , the machine thatp134sent me here , the machine that sends everybody somewhere , the machine that kills the living and eats the dead and crushes the bones to blue dust . I look at Darrell and he is beautiful in the porthole light of the bathroom . His greased hair and white teeth shine in the pale light and I love him because he 's beautifuland because he 's been so kind to explain things to me and also because he makes fun of the machine and I know he 's goingto be my best friend . I look again to the Hun machine and standing there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like granma or like the king of China and I do n't feel well . So would you like to join our club , Darrell says . Yes , I say . And you swear you 're not crazy . Yes , I say . Yes , yes my beloved Darrell with your hand rubbing my leg . Yes , yes . Can you fight , he says . Yes , I lie in a brave voice . You 'll soon have a chance to prove it , Big Jim says . No , I say . What , Darrell says in a surprised voice . I ca n't fight the machine , the machine , I say , getting scared , my head moving back and forth . Darrell gets up to go . You lied to us , he says , still smiling . No , no , I say . He is crazy after all , Darrell says to Big Jim as they go out the door without saying goodbye.  |p135No  , no . Everything is so confusing . It 's morning . I wake suddenly and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet and a scream of a far waker and I think for a minute that maybe it 's me going down the pipe but then I realize that life is more than wishes . In slow slow stages my mind grows strong . A bit of sunlight on a wall . A desk I 've never seen before . A bunk above me I did n't know was there . Each slow stage is announced by the beat of a powerful drum . BOOM BOOM BOOM . With each waking stage a monstrousidea forms more and more into the hot white mass caused by the dripping wax of a candle going out . BOOM splush BOOM splush BOOM splush . FFsssssssss . The heart beat grows soft . Ca n't even hear it . Hear a bird though , and a scream . The candle 's out and I do n't have any matches . The cold hard white mass of knowing for damn sure I 'm not crazy and that I ca n't easily become crazy is there again and is something that may drive me batty . Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Hood is yelling . Lots of noise in the hall . Doors slamming open . Bedspringsspringing . Curses . Coughs . Curses . Toilets flushing . Bare feet running . My door opens . Good morning , Timmy , Mister Hood says . Good morning , I say . Oh come on now , be cheerful . It 's a beautiful sunny dayp136out . How would you like to go with the rest of the boys to breakfast this morning . Yes , I say . Hey , Mister Hood , a boy behind him yells . Yes , he says , turning around . I do n't have any socks , the boy says , and there are n't any in the closet and my underwear is full of holes , when are we going to get some more . Just a minute , Frank . I 'll be right with you . And , Timmy , you get dressed , I 've decided that from now on you can have as much freedom as the rest of the boys . Yes sir , I say , and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue dungarees and green shirt which someone must have washed , though not good enough to get the blood out , and the black-and-white socks and the gray prison-type jacket someone has left on the desk . I put everything on as I 'm supposed to and zip the jacket as far up as I can and stand in the middle of my little room listening to the bedlam in the hall that I 'd really never heard before . Bang , boom , crash , shit and goddamn , c'm on you guys let 's get with it let 's go , slam , flush , bang , the screech of a water pipe that 's turned off too fast , a toilet that wo n't shut up . It 's as if I 'm hearing things I can only rememberfrom dreams . I open my door and go out to the empty hall . I go down the hall slowly not believing at first that I 'm awake and alone and walking around like everyone else and that I 'm actually going outside . With some effort I open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face like ten arms burning and I close my eyes and close the door and go back to my room and sit on the bed . Minutes pass with only the sound of that running toilet and the brush of the wind on my window . I go to the window . My building has made a big shadow on the grass and the shadow is comforting even though I know it will slowly shorten and then jump to the other side . I look at all the buildingsand wonder which one is Cindy 's . I decide I have to go out but not when . I know I 'm well now but I also know that things do n't happen to people without leaving a little something to remindthem that if it happened once it could happen again . I open my door and go down the hall again . Should I jump in all at once or just stick my toes in . I open the main door and jump in all at once . It takes getting used to but when I do it 's warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess they 're all too busy eating . The stream is still there and one of the white ducks sees me and swims under a bridge because I guess it 's forgotten me but that 's okay , maybe I 'll get some bread and they 'll remember . I go into the dining room and get a tray and a server slops on some yellow and gray eggs and another gives buttered toast and a dented bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee . This one is the same one who hired me before . I look at him wishing he 'd remember me but then I remember I saw him several times in K building and he never said anything . I pick up a spoon from the spoon tray and start to leave and he says , hey boy , howp138would you like a job cleaning tables and working in the kitchen . How much does it pay , I say . It does n't pay anything , he says . It gives you something to do . No , I say , and go to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sit down and look around for the first time . Half the dining room is filled with boys and alcoholics chattering to each other and bumming cigarettes and getting ready to leave . At one big table Darrell and Big Jim and two colored guys and two other white guys are sitting and staring at me . I put my hands in my lap and stare at my tray . Out of one eye 's corner I see two other boys getting up and starting to come over . Hey you two , sit down , no one talks to him , I hear Big jim say . They sit . Some boys leave . Others stay to stare . Powdered eggs , powdered milk , some day there 'll be powderedpeople , I think to myself , staring at my tray . I eat the eggs and think of roast turkey and I drink the bitter coffee and think of a milk shake and when I get a drop of cereal on the table I wipe off the gluey spot before it hardens as if I were at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . I have my freedom now and most of my sanity , how does anyone ever know about that , and I have clean clothes and I have a diary and if I thought about it enough maybe I could think of some other things but I do n't have anyone to talk to and if I had that I 'd give up the other things . I look up . Big Jim is talking to me . Hey you , crazy boy , P139punk , queer , creep . I look back to the eggs again . Big Jim had his finger up and I think , how brilliant of him . Beautiful Darrell just sat and smiled . Some of the boys are still laughing but not all . The machine as always has destroyed the inheritors. n z A R Y  --  December 10  --  I do n't like myself much any more . I guess I never really did . I only pretended to so that I could have at least one friend . I finally joined the club . Each time I meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have questions . This morning I felt great . It was my second morning of freedom and I was twice as used to the taunts of Big Jim and others of the Mafia . On my way to breakfast and lunch I said hello to the white ducks and I think they remembered me because they quacked hello back . The meals were better if just as lonely . The walks back were cold because of the dining room being overheated but the blackened trees against the sky were pretty . This evening as I write this I feel great . I 've cleaned my room and made my bed again . I played a ping-pong game with Darrell and even though he would n't talk to me just being close to him was nice . Mister Hood told me it was okay to use one of my blankets to make a tent of my bed as long as I promise to take it down when the doctors come around for inspection . In return I told him I hid the keys under a radiator and he thanked me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dime in the shower room . I feel great . But between the time of morning and afternoon it was different . I spent sev/eral hours thinking of all the ways I could kill myself . I have questions . Does Joe remember what I did . Does he forgive me . Does God . Who am I. How do I change once I find out and how do I get out of here and who is God and why does n't He do what He 's supposed to . I just heard over the hall radio that hordes of bugle-blowing yellow men in pajamas are running up a hill to attack us . Why , and who are us , and who are the crazy ones . And it 's dark out , how can they see . I have questions . My body disturbs me . I 'm too skinny and my arms and legs are too long . My feet stink . My ears stick out . My teeth hurt . This morning I woke up thinking of Cindy 's body and I felt wonderful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheet became wet . I wish I knew how to do that again . What is it all about . Last night I passed an open door and saw Barney the colored boy naked and lying on top of some white boy like a purple bee in a yellow flower . I sort of know what they were doing but I do n't really know why or why they did n't close the door . I have questions . Why did Chuck die and why did I then care so much but care so little now . Why does no one like me and why do I think so different from others . I have questions too big to write . How can I know who I am or what I am or where I am if no one cares enough to tell me and I do n't care enough to ask . I put my diary and pencil between my mattress and spring and go to the locked barless window . Outside the leaves are falling like dying butterflies and the lawn does n't need to be mowed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and the almost bare/foot trees prove more than anything else that things do n't die , they just sleep . But what about Chuck . And why are Joe and the others dying so slowly . And when will my turn come to rot . I look in the mirror but all I see is myself . How many hairs are there . What lies beyond the skin . What is hair . Are fingernailsthe same as hair . How can a bone grow or break . Or a stick or a star . What the hell is going on and why is there no one to tell me . Oh well . I 'll find out everything some day . The thing that hurts the most is that everybody else already seems to know all there is to know . And the attendants and doctors must think so too because there is n't any school here . And even though I 'm never included in any of the kids ' conversations I overhear enough to know that no one ever asks questions . They give answers when none are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who can swear the dirtiest . But they never ask questions . I go to the window . The shadow of my building has jumped to the afternoon side . Beyond the ball field there 's an orchard . I wonder why trees always undress for the cold . Should n't it be the other way around . It must be nice to know everything or at least to pretend to which is almost the same thing . It must be very nice to not to want to ask why things are or when will they be a different way . It must be very very nice to be with the others whether right or wrong and have them teach me to know without knowing and not care . There must be harder things in the world than to leave ap142room and enter a hall but when I do , and close my door behind me , I ca n't think of any . Hi , one kid says as I pass him . Hi , I say . Another nods and I nod back . Two others stare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pet hamsters or something . I wish I had . Even harder than getting in the hall is the job of opening the door to the dayroom but I do it . I 've been in this room once before , that time I delivered here when they were being punished for breaking some windows in the girls ' building . But things have changed since then . All the thick windows have been cracked over and over . The entrance to the tunnel is blocked by a table and some chairs as if they never expected to be punished again . Darrell is playing ping-pong with another kid at a table in the center of the room . Most of the rest of the kids on the ward are here sitting at the walls , playing cards or talking or watching the game . The Mafia is sitting alone under a knotted fire hose . Everyone stops to look at me except Darrell and his ping-pong partner and I wish I had n't come in . Well look who 's here , miss cutie pie violent ward , Big Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . I stare at the ball . Pockety pockety pockety pock . Back and forth , back and forth , smiling Darrell , beautiful Darrell . The ball has a dent in it.  |p143Hey  punk I hear you suck dick , Barney one of the colored Mafia says . Everyone laughs except Darrell and his ping-pong partner . I can tell it has a dent because sometimes Darrell hits it to the right and it goes to the left . This of course is very confusing to the other player . Pockety pockety pockety pick pockety . His name is Timothy , Corky the third-in-command says in a girlish voice . Hello , Timothy darling , he screeches as everyone laughs . Pockey pockety back and forth tap on the net pockety smack pockety . Aw leave him alone , Harmon the other colored Mafia says in a low voice . Faster faster moving moving . Hey miss cutie pie violent ward , Big Jim says . Barney called you a punk . That means you have to fight him . From left to right faster and faster back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits and hits and smiles at the sweat of the other pockety pock black hair white teeth hit and wait and hit harder slam a high one caught served back pockety pockety faster faster to the left and Darrell 's there to the right and Darrell 's there back and forth farther from the table faster faster Roman god slamming catching backing away tapping catching slamming dancing from side to side all watchingsudden battle except Barney who says , hey Tim Tim baby I 'm gon na bust your fucking head unless you get right on over here right now and suck my black dick.  |p144Pockety  pockety sweat and fear of being hurt or killed or even worse of being proven a punk pockety pockety please God please pockety pockety pick slam , the ball goes to the windowsthe paddle of god Darrell flies across the table hitting Barneynigger in foot , owwww , he yells , everyone jumps up , you son-of-a-bitch you almost killed me , Barney nigger says . Darrell stands smiling . I open the door and walk out and then run to my room . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and look at the wall as if I could see in the green plaster the insanity needed for the moment . I know I wo n't go insane and I know that even if I did they would n't put me in another violent ward but I also know that I do n't know either for a fact . Some things are hard for some people and some things are easy . Rather than face a boy in combat I would do anything , even deliver to K again or even stay there for a while again as long as it was n't too long a while . Losing is n't bad and getting hurt means nothing but doing either in front of other kids is the worst thing in the world . There 's a knock on my door . I wait and there 's another one . I look to the porthole and I see Darrell 's face . Come in , I say . Darrell comes in and closes the door and leans against the wall . You 've got courage or else you would n't have stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . You do n't know how to fight do you , he says . No . I 'd like to teach you . Why . Someone taught me . Who . Does n't matter who , he says . I beat him so bad on the final lesson he had to learn all over again . You did , I say . You got lots to learn . How 'd you like a teacher . Yes . We all hate Barney , you know . And he 's out to get you because he says you looked at him bad a couple of times . But I did n't , I say . Of course you did n't . But that does n't matter . He 's out to get you anyway . I could beat him easy but that would n't prove anything . But if a new kid like you knocked him down or made him yell he 'd have to leave the club and you could take his place . But I do n't want to . But , Timmy , he says , sitting on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter what you want and it wo n't until you 're big enough to make it . Right now you have to obey our rules . And the first rule is that you have to obey me above all . What do you want me to do . P146I 've been here for two and a half months . I only had two fights but they were good ones . Both helped to make me numbertwo in the Mafia . I have about two weeks to go and then my doctor and social worker will declare me sane and get me a job on the outside because I do n't have any parents . Before I go I want to take on Big Jim and break his arms so that he 'll never be leader again of anything . I also want you to take on Barney and close his mouth and then I 'll kick him out of the club and you 'll take his place . But I do n't want to , I say . Does n't matter what you want . I need your help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want both to fall together , so there it is , there is n't any argument . But I ca n't fight , I say . Of course you can . Everybody can . Especially after a few of my lessons . Are you ready for lesson number one . Yes , I guess so . He stands up with his legs apart , his right foot in front of his left , his hands up . Boxers stand like this , he says . They move back and forth on the balls of their feet and dance like this with their shoulders moving in and out . Yes , I say . And they hold their hands like this , he says , putting his left fist in front of his nose and his right in front of his left . And they jab like this , he says , jabbing , moving back and forth , his shoulders moving in and out.  |p147And  they lead with their right until they find an opening and then hit with their left and then their right again , he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing from side to side , his feet dancing . Yes , I say . Now the important thing to remember is that you ca n't hurt anyone with just a fist or an arm . You have to punch with your shoulder and when you find an opening you have to let go with your whole body , being careful not to lose your balance , he says , throwing wild punches with his whole body . I understand , I say . No you do n't , he says , stopping his dance and sitting on the bed again . I want you to hit me in the shoulder with all your might . I do and he laughs . Now give me your shoulder , he says . I do and close my eyes and his painful punch shakes every bone in my body . I make a face and rub my shoulder . Now you 're ready for lesson number two , he says . Numbertwo is that you must forget all I just said . You 'll never be a boxer because you 're too skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one boxes except in the ring anyway and there are n't any rings around here . But if you fight the way Barneyand everybody else fights and if you do it to them before they do it to you , you wo n't have anything to worry about . I do n't understand , I say . Give me your hand , he says.  |p148I  do and he shows me how to pull the fingers apart so that they hurt so much I almost beg him to stop . Stand up , he says . I do and he shows me how a finger can go in an eye and how a fist or palm can go under a nose and drive the bone into the head and how an elbow or the flat of a hand can go into a throat and how a knee can go into a crotch and how a foot can destroy a shin and how to trip using one leg and a fast push and how to stomp on the fallen and how to pick him up with two fingers under his ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck take him by the hair pull his head down knee him in the face and stomp him again . I 'm glad when the lesson ends because every muscle in my body has been hit , pushed , or prodded by my strange teacher and I ache all over . We sit on the bed again and Darrell says , always remember , Timmy , that when you hit somebody with any part of your body always pretend that that part is a piece of steel and never think of what you 're hitting . What do you mean , I say . I mean that you should always think of the back of what you 're hitting because that thought will help your hand or foot to get there . If you knee somebody in the face think of the back of his head and if you elbow him in the back think of his belly button . And even more important than that never hit anybody with your body when there 's something lying on the groundp149that you can pick up like a rock or a stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget that one surprise attack is worth all the muscles and training in the world . And do n't worry about any spectators calling you a dirty fighter because they 'd do it themselves if they had the chance and because you can always do the same to them later . Wide-eyed and rubbing my crotch where he squeezed it and my arm where he twisted it I say , knowledge is a painful thing is n't it . He laughs and says that he did n't feel a thing and that now I know how to handle myself and that he 'll give me another lesson tonight after supper and another one tomorrow after the initiation . What initiation , I say . They 're going to initiate you tomorrow to see if you deserve to live but do n't worry because I wo n't let them hurt you . And do n't worry about Barney either , I wo n't let you fight him until I 'm absolutely sure you can win . But what if I 'm not sure , I say . Does n't matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be ready . And at the same time that you 're using what I taught you on Barney I 'm going to take on Big Jim . I stare at him and he smiles and helps me rub the leg muscle where he kicked me before . He may be crazy but he 's also magnificent . Just when I think he 's going to rub me all over andp150would n't that be nice , someone in the hall yells that it 's time for supper and Darrell gets up and leaves without saying goodbye . I wait for a while and when the hall is empty I follow . After supper and in my room I remember Darrell sitting in friendship with Big Jim and the rest of the Mafia as if nothinghe 'd said was real , as if nothing anywhere were real . Some of the kids wanted to talk to me I think but as before the Mafia stopped them , this time saying that until I passed all the initiationtests and fought Barney I was n't even human . Barney called me names and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the shakes and I wanted to look at Darrell but I was afraid to . I look in my mirror and I look human but the mirror is so dirty it makes my face look dirty . Would n't it be funny if the mirror were really clean . My hair is so long I look like a girl . I 'll have to ask Darrell or Mister Hood where the barber shop is . All the time I 've been here and I 've never known . I hope it 's free . There 's a knock on my door and Darrell comes in . It 's a good thing you do n't get mad easily but I guess you ca n't afford to , he says , hopping up to sit on my desk . Why do they hate me , I say . They do n't , he says . Barney hates everybody because he hates himself and Big Jim just wants somebody to get stomped and he does n't much care who . You 're the easiest target of bothp151because you 're new and afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a second when you beat Barney . They will , I say . Yes , he says . Even if you lose you 'll at least gain their respect . In this business it 's always best to get into a fight with the first one who bothers you and on the first day if possible , then the others will leave you alone . What do you mean , in this business . I 'll tell you what I mean . Not all the twenty or so kids in here are crazy , you know . Big Jim is and maybe four or five others . Barney is filled with hate , Corky is a junkie , Frank never talks to anyone , Harmon , that 's our other nigger , he thinks he 's white . He 's the nicest guy in the whole place but he 's so prejudiced we do n't let him walk around alone because whenever he sees another nigger he 'll go right up and sock him . Then he hates Barney too , I say . Yes , and I 'm counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the fight . I 've already told him and he agrees . Is n't there any other way , I say . No , he says . You see , Timmy , most of the rest of the kids here are just confused , lonely , or afraid . They 've been in orphanages , homes , and observation centers all their lives and will continue to be until they 're old enough for jail or until they crack completely and have to spend forever in a K buildingsomewhere . That 's their business . Some people are plumbers and some are presidents . The ones in here are the professionally rejected . No one wants them and never will . There is n't anyp152other way for you because like me you are one of the very few who has hope . And if you do n't start fighting now you 'll lose that hope and end up like the others . Hey , what are you crying about . I 'm not , I say , sniffling . Okay have it your way , you 're not then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on the bed . You know , he says , with his arm on my shoulder , I want us to be good friends but you 're going to have to pay for my friendship . How , I say . First , never cry . Okay , I say . Second , lesson number three is about to start so get up and pay attention . I stand up . My problem is I just do n't give a fuck about anything . At least that 's what my doctor says . But when I see someone crying I begin to wonder . Have you ever been to the nursery in the little kids ' building . No , I say . They 've got rows and rows of cribs there filled with tomorrow'snuts . When they grow up and they 're old enough to know that no one wants them they 'll steal or rape or go batty and be locked up again and again like us . You looked like one of the babies just then when you cried . I worked there for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p153and  I used to think if I could only teach them to fight at such an early age they 'd have nothing to worry about . Maybe they 'd have more , I say . Maybe , but at least they 'd have a minimum of getting beat up by others . At least they 'd have respect . Maybe , I say . I tried to rape one of the nurses there so I got fired but that 's another story . Are you ready now for lesson three . Yes , I say . A fast hour of teaching goes by . The funny thing is that he does n't hurt me this time like he did before . Even funnier is the fact that I 'm learning whether I want to or not . You learn quick , he says . And you have good reflexes . Maybe you can take him tomorrow . No , I say . Maybe next week . Maybe whenever I tell you , he says . Now scratch your head with your left hand as a feint and jab your fingers into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend it back hard . See , I go to my knees . Now if you wanted to you could knee me in the face but please do n't . And if someone grabs you from behinduse your elbow in his stomach , turn around , and go for his apple . Beautiful , Timmy . But think of steel . Stiffen your fingers and your whole arm and think of steel . And if you 're close enough the best thing in the world is to knee him in the balls . And if you ca n't knee him there , grab him there , you can alwayswash your hands later . You 'll have plenty of time be-P154cause he 'll still be on the ground when you come back to step on his head . Hey , Darrell , what are you doing in there , a voice calls from my porthole . Shut up and go away , Darrell says , and stuffs a magazine in the hole so nobody can see in . And if he gets you on the ground with a leg lock around your neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on the ass . But I do n't think I want to demonstrate that one . You 're kidding , I say . Not a bit , he says . But of course you have no business beingon the ground in the first place . And the best guy to fight is a blind one so try to pick up some dirt or sand and throw a handful in his eyes and then let him have it before he can get it out . I may even give you a little invention of mine to carry around . What 's that , I say . A little toilet-paper sack filled with pepper . Oh , I say . And clothes are very important . If you can grab the end of his jacket and pull it over his head so that he ca n't see then you can trip him and drop hard with your knee going into his stomach and it 'll be all over . I see , I say wishing I did n't . Lights out , come on you guys let 's hit the sack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , Timmy , and do n't worry about a thing , he says . I take his hand and say goodnight and he smiles and leaves . The lights go out . The noise dies . I fall asleep wishing I were someplace else or someone else but knowing that since I am here and I am me I 'm lucky to have a friend like Darrell . I dream all night of Roman gladiators . Morning . Coughing and sneezing and cursing and flushing and banging and running . Sunlight and chattering and fright and screaming . Upanatem , time to get up , come on , let 's go , Mister Hood is yelling . I dress and wait hoping Darrell might come in . When he does n't I wait until the hall is quiet and then leave and walk along the stream planning not to go to breakfast this morning and maybe not to lunch either . But when I see the ducks I remember that I 'm not one and that since sooner or later I 'll have to face the things people do I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids look up when I go in and get my tray and sit far from the rest but no one says anything . The Mafia , sitting at their usual table , knows I 'm here but does n't seem to care.  |p156They  are looking at girlie magazines and drawing in them the appropriate words and symbols as they always do and not one looks up or says anything . Maybe they 've thought up a new game or someone new to torture . Maybe everything 's all right now . Maybe Mister Hood or somebody has told them to leave me alone , I 'm sick or I 'm shy or I 'm really a good kid or something . Three kids get up and carry their trays to the serving table where they scrape and pound all garbage into the garbage barreland stack the trays on the tray pile and carefully put the bowls , cups , and spoons into a deep metal tray which when full will be carried to and pushed into a washer by the men working in the kitchen . Two more get up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last four get up and leave to join the others wishing , I think , they could stay . Now the dining room is empty except for the Mafia and they pocket their magazines and carry their trays to the serving table where they throw them all into the garbage barrel and leave without even looking at me . I sit back in my chair and close my eyes and think of Cindy and think of how happy I am that they 've forgotten me . When I open them I see Barney standing in the door . We 're ready if you are , punk , he says and then goes . I get up and carry my tray to the table and feed the garbage barrel and stack the tray and cup and spoon as slowly as I can and for a while I pretend it did n't happen.  |p157When  I 'm done I open the door pretending not to notice the food turning into fear in my stomach but as I go down the steps my legs seem to want only to listen to my stomach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day is cloudy and cold in more ways than one and rounding a building corner as if in ambush the coldest of black and white hearts walk toward me followed by the rest of the Mafia . The six surround me . You got to be initiated , Big Jim says . We 're gon na give you a few tests , punk , Barney says . And if you do n't pass them we 're gon na send you back to that crazy ward you came from . You got to be initiated , Big Jim says again as if he likes the sound of the only big word he knows . We do n't like wise guys around here , Corky the junkie says , pushing me hard in the shoulder . What 's he got to do first , Frank says . First he 's got to take down his pants , Barney says . Frank , you go get a stick . Frank goes to get a stick . No , Darrell says . We did that last time . Let 's think of something different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim says . Barney glares at Darrell.  |p158Let  's walk around for a while until we think of something we 've never done before , Darrell says . Yeah , Big Jim says . Frank comes back with a stick . C'm on , let 's beat him , Corky says . Yeah , Big Jim says . I said we 're going to do something else this time , Darrell says . C'm on , let 's walk around . Yeah , Big Jim says . Barney and Corky glare at Darrell . Frank puts his stick in his pocket . Harmon takes it out with his black hands and throws it away . Frank shrugs and Barney glares at Harmon who glares back and as we walk on the grass by the stream everyone becomes quiet and serious and I do n't know whether to hate Darrell for getting me into this or love him for getting me out . I know , Frank says . Let 's make him steal some candy for us from the Sweet Shoppe . No , everybody else says . How about making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Harmon says with Barney glaring at him in hatred . How come you hate your own kind , Corky says . I do n't hate my own kind , I just hate them niggers , Harmonsays with everyone laughing except Barney . How about making him kill one of them white ducks , Corky says.  |p159Aw  no , Frank says . I like ducks . Yeah , let 's do that , Big Jim says . Yeah , Barney says . And he has to pull out all the feathers first . Wait , I got a better idea , Darrell says . Thankyou , thankyou , I think to myself . Let 's go over to the alleys behind the buildings and do what we did before with Corky , Darrell says . Yeah , Corky says . That 's a good idea . Beautiful , Barney says . But this time he 's got to fuck her or else it 's no good . Yeah , he 's got to fuck her this time , Frank says . Yeah , Big Jim says . What you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as we go over the lawn toward the alleys . We 're going to find a crazy woman either in the tunnel or walking around all alone in an alley . We 'll pick her out for you because we 've done this several times before . She has to be a real nut , the kind who is so crazy she wo n't remember what happened two minutes later . You 're going to put one hand over her mouth so she do n't scream and knock her down and then you 're going to lift up her dress and put one of your fingers up her snatch . But he has to fuck her this time , Corky says . Yeah , Barney says . No he does n't , Darrell says . None of the others had to exceptme and I did it because I wanted to . Yeah , Big Jim says.  |p160And  do n't fake it like one kid did , punk , Barney says . Because when you come back we 're going to sniff your fingers , Big Jim says . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corky says . You should see what we did to that kid who faked it , Barneysays . We almost killed him , Frank says . We went too far that day , Harmon says . We never go far enough , Barney says . Yeah , Big Jim says . But I ca n't do that , I say . If you fake it I 'm going to beat hell out of you , Big Jim says . And if you do n't even try we 're all going to beat hell out of you , Barney says . What if someone sees me , I say , knowing I ca n't do it and wondering how far I can run before they catch me . Nobody will see you , Darrell says . It 's too cold for doctors or nurses to be out and nobody else cares . And if you actually do have the balls to fuck her you get to be leader of our club for as long as you 're here , Corky says as the others solemnly nod their approval . That 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim got to be boss and that 's how I got to be second-in-command . They really do take me for an idiot , I think to myself . And maybe I am . Okay , I say , hoping to get it over with fast , hopingp161even more we wo n't find anyone and they 'll let me go until tomorrow and maybe even forget about it . We walk for a while looking into alleys and talking about how maybe Frank should be initiated over again with me because when he did it he only used a stick and it had so much blood on it that no one wanted to sniff it so there was n't any real proof . Frank laughs and says okay but my friend Darrell says no it is n't any fun when one is willing and I have to do it alone and I begin to wonder what kind of friend I have . Other people are walking on the lawn mostly by themselves . Most of the women are ugly old bags as usual and nowherenear an alley . One comes close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is opening and closing like a fish and no words are coming out . Let 's follow her and when she comes close enough to an alley we 'll pull her in and the punk can go to work , Barney says . No , Corky says . We do n't want Timmy to get syphilis of the fingers . Everyone laughs in a quiet way except Frank who gets hysterical and has to be hit in the back by Darrell . On the side of the alcoholic building we find the right one . She 's an obvious nut and old but not too old , about twenty or thirty . She had once been pleasant-looking if not pretty but now her craziness is making " the dumb broad " as Darrell calls her , look hideous . Go on up , someone says.  |p162Darrell  , I say as if to plead for my life . Go on , he says . You have to . The others wait far behind me . I walk toward her and follow about ten feet away . I hope to heaven she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people or even into the field but no , she walks into the alley that separates the alcoholic building from another and I have to follow . I look over my shoulder and see the boys standing at the back entrance . At first I hope the broad will run when she sees me but when I see the high fence at the front of the alley I realize that I am just as trapped as she is . Once she turns around when I bump into a garbage can but does n't see me . But I see her and the fault in her mind has pulled the corners of her mouth down into a permanent frown that her eyes do n't seem to agree with . The darks of them are happily polished like a wax floor but the whites are filthy . She turns around again and continues and I follow , getting closer . The back of her is more frightening than the front because it 's more real . She wears a light blue skirt unlike the dark gray ones most women wear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the way anyone would on the street of a town . In my mind I run up to her and cover her mouth with my left hand , pushing her against the noisy garbage cans with my right . I climb on top of her and get under her skirt and do what I have to do , whatever that is , and with her screams in my ears I get up and run back to the boys and their acceptance . Excuse me miss , I say . I have to talk to you.  |p163Without  turning around she walks to a half-lidded garbage can and stops to look down at the clean half with its carefully scrubbed tin , the dirty half with its potato peels , coffee grounds , old clothes with catsup . Are there really human bodies in there . You are garbage , I am garbage , I think to myself . The ones in back of us are garbage , I say out loud . She turns around . What , she says . I move a step backward . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel are n't you , she says , her white hands going to her face . I have to do something with you to get into the club , I say moving a step forward and wishing I were dead . Praise be , she says . I 've been waiting a long time . Just let me touch you , I say . I wo n't hurt you . Come to me Lord , I 've waited , I 've waited . I go to her and cover her mouth with my left hand as I planned but she kisses it . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I say as I help her gently to the garbage-strewnground between two cans . I 'm sorry , I say as I lift up her skirt and get between her legs . I 'm sorry , I say into her smiling face as I reach under her pants and put my finger into where I think it should be put . It goes in and I 'm so surprisedI jump up and try to get away but she grabs me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say . But I have to go now . Let me go please . I do n't know what else to say so we struggle for a while and finally I manage to get up and run a few feet to another can . I stop to look around and she is stillp164lying there with her skirt up and her legs apart and a smile beneath her waxed eyes . I 'm sorry , I say . You see there 's this club and I had to .. . Praise be . I waited so long ... . Goodbye , I say . I hope to see you again . I. . . . And then I run back to the boys with that finger waving proudly in the air . They all laugh and slap at my back and a couple of them take a sniff at my finger and yell with loud approval . I feel wonderfully accepted . What did she say to you , Corky asks . She thought I was an angel from heaven , I say . Everyone laughs and I feel great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Frank asks . It was wet and gushy , I say , laughing along with the rest . You 're in the club now , Harmon says . You 're one of us . That 's right , Darrell says . Welcome to the Mafia . No he is n't , Barney says . I had to do a lot more than that . Make him do something else . Yeah , Big Jim says . Let 's walk around and find something else . He 's already passed the main test , Darrell says to Barney . When he passes the next he takes your place . What are you talking about , Barney yells . I 'm already inthe fucking club . What do you mean he takes my place . That 's what I said boy , Darrell says . You want to do something about it.  |p165They  stand facing each other . Barney 's chocolate face darkens . I can see he 's ready to fight but the sight of Big Jim standing by Darrell 's side makes him move back . That 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he passes the next test you got to go to the bottom of the line . Yeah , Harmon says . Okay , Barney says . You win . Let 's see what the punk can do next . We all leave the alley entrance and walk into the ball field with Barney trailing . I keep wondering what that poor woman is doing but soon I forget and begin to worry about what I 'll have to do next . Halfway across the field and past the baseball diamond and two arguments from the stream about white ducks we stop because of a black shape running toward us and then plopping in the hard dirt to put its head on its paws and wag its tail as if to say , hi there , I 'm playing games too . I feel now that I 'm accepted and can do no wrong . I 'm the first to see the dog and also the first to call to him . He comes running and I 'm so happy to be among friends and to have a dog running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . It 's a pupper dog . C'mere pupper dog , c'mere do n't be afraid , we wo n't hurt you . A few yards from us the dog stops to plop again on the dirt and prick up its ears and hold its head to one side as if to say , I 'll play with you if you wo n't hurt me but first you must promise.  |p166I  sneak closer and give him all the promises in the world but stop when I hear Barney laughing . He has to catch that dog and kill it , Barney is saying . You are a sick one are n't you , Harmon says . Wait , Big Jim says , before they begin to tangle . A Mafia member has spoken . So be it , Darrell says . No , I say . Yeah , Big Jim says . You have to catch it . And kill it , Barney says . Aw no , Frank says . He just has to catch it and fling it around by its tail , Corky says . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has to catch the mutt and kill it . Yes , Darrell says . But how . I know where there 's a rope to hang it . Over there by the water pipe , Barney says , pointing to the pipe several yards from where the dog is now sniffing at some dirty ice . He can do something else , Frank says . Yes I 'll do something else , I say . Yes , Darrell says to Barney . But after all , this is a court . Once he catches it he 'll get into the club and then he can join us to decide the animal 's fate . Do n't you agree . Barney does n't but the others do . I go toward the dog calling him and hoping he 'll run away . He does n't . He must be very hungry for he comes right up top167me . I let him sniff my hand to make sure he wo n't bite and then pat his head and rub his back . He 's quite friendly and after making friends with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my back so the others ca n't see I hit him as hard as I can on the head . But all he does is back away , whiningand licking his lips . When I whisper , get the hell out of here , he comes back to me and licks my face . I get ready to hit him again but suddenly they are all in back of me and Corky is pushing me away and Barney is grabbing at the dog and lifting him up . Corky takes the rope from Barney and ties a knot around the dog 's neck . Aw no , Frank says . Shut up , Barney says and takes the rope back and throws the dog away and begins to run with the rope dragging the dog behind him . You bastards , I say and try to follow but Big Jim grabs me and laughs as Barney winds the rope in his hands so the dog is close enough to swing and then with the dog slowly leaving the ground he begins to swing it around and around faster and faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Big Jim but he catches me and knocks me down and I see Barney stopping his swing and letting the dog bounce over the ground to a stop and then I see Barney and Corky throwing their end of the rope over the naked . limb of one of the fruit trees and it 's then I realize we 're close to the orchard and I think to myself this is n't the fruit God planned on and I leavep168the arms of Big Jim and begin to jump at the rope that holds the dog , his paws waving in the air as if he were paddling in a pool , and I miss two times but on the third jump I grab the rope and knock Corky down and Darrell is yelling at me , now Timmy now , and Barney knocks me down and the dog falls and Big Jim is laughing and Frank is crying and Harmon and Darrell are looking at each other and I 'm yelling , goddamn you all , and Darrell again yells , now Timmy now , and I get up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and Darrellagain yells , now Timmy now , and I barely duck Barney 's swinging foot and get up and run past him to the dog and untie his neck and he runs away even faster than I wanted him to and Barney hits me again as hard as he can but this time when I go down I see at the same time one human blackness pounding another and Barney falls to the feet of a swinging Harmon and Big Jim and Corky are yelling and Frank is still crying and Darrell is just standing there . When I look up again Darrell is all alone and kneeling besideme with his hand exploring one of the bumps on my head . It was all set , he says . It was perfect . Harmon was behind you and I was ready to take on Big Jim . It was beautiful . Why did you fuck it up by letting the dog free . I stare up and still love him . Lying on the bed which Darrell helped me to reach I listen to the noise of the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if what happened really happened or was it just an/other dream of the past and how long will the past continue and what kind of a diary or teacher can change a time or a personif indeed this is a time and I am a person . Reality is a funny thing . There are no defenses against it except madness . I would love so much to be able to escape into the world of the people this place was built for but it just is n't that easy . I hurt all over and my crotch is wet and Barney hates me even more than he did before and I wish life were simpler . The dog got away at least . I 'll bet he 'll think twice the next time someone calls him . I bet I will too , but then I always did . D I A R Y  --  December 13  --  Yesterday I did n't go to lunch or supper . I do n't think I was missed . Last night Darrell came in and touched me a lot so I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night about how I 'll win the next fight and how he 'll beat Big Jim and then everything will be all right and about his seeing his doctor soon and then going home and when I get out he 'd like to take care of me like a big brother . I told him it sounded great but since there was n't anyone to take me out I might never get out and he said that in two months he 'd be eighteen and could legally adopt me if I wanted . Oh well . But this morning as I walked to breakfast I thought about his silly idea and the more I thought about it the more I wanted it to happen . But he did n't speak to me at breakfast , I do n't know why , and Barney stared at me in hatred and no one talked but everybody looked and I ate the cereal but could n't drink from the cup of milk because it kept splashing allp170over the place . It 's funny that that is one thing one should never admit . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly frightened but never scared . It 's a law no boy can break without being a complete creep . I was scared with that doctor and in the car that brought me here and with Skinny and during that riot and I could n't admit it then either but because I was with adults I could at least fold my arms and be quiet and if a tear did fall I could lick it away without shame . I knew that an adult would n't kill me or tell others I was scared and I knew his callingme a punk or a queer or a sick bastard would n't make me one even though they should know , being adults . But when another kid attacks , tears are useless and so is shrinking back because the more I cry the more they do n't have to . My fear now is like it was at school when I had to fight a kid with others looking on and no wise adult to keep one of us from dyingor even worse from being the laughed-at coward for days afterward until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During it , Darrell was called to his doctor . Now I feel completely alone . I wish he 'd hurry back . I clean my tray and stack it and walk out . My diary is waiting for me under my mattress and I look forward to opening it again and adding more nonsense and I do n't want to think about anything else . My walk to it is colder than the black potatoes and the trees that surround us look foolish with their naked arms knockingagainst the white worried sky , saying please please let me last through it with a little more dignity.  |p171The  grass looks dead and I suppose it is and if a white feather floats on the cold stream I do n't see it . A bug flies in the air . How silly it is . Does n't it know it has to be dead for things to go on . The wind blows cold against my face . Where is that first snow , I ask myself so as not to really see the bunches of boys ahead of me and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask again , looking up at the sky , feeling it and them coming closer , feeling a flake or was it only a breath of wind , feeling and also smelling the hot-potato-and-mustard breath of Big Jim . You got more initiations to come , punk , he says grabbing my jacket collar , pulling it above my head . Your punk friends Darrell and Harmon are n't here to protectyou this time , Barney says as he kicks my leg . If you want to join our club you 'll have to prove yourself worthy , Corky says as he grabs my arms and holds them behind me . I do n't want to , I think to myself . But I am worthy . I am , I am . Someone hits me hard in the shoulder as if to test his strength . I look around and Frank looks disappointed . Not knowing what else to do I smile . Someone else grabs my hair and the pain almost makes me yell but I promise myself I wo n't , they 'll respect that . Another punches me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and rips it . I 'm now being pushed and pulled into the middle of a moving , howling mob . The next thing I thinkp172of is so silly . I 'll tell my diary on you , I almost say . Instead I say in a friendly voice , where 's Darrell . The only answer is the shouts and punches of the club and all the other kids moving tight against me , forcing me to walk across the lawn . Everyone is yelling and laughing at me and the closest of them are pounding at me as if I were a locked door and my mouth opens to spit blood because it hurts most when they hit my face . I ca n't see a thing because of the tears and because I have to keep my head ducked low because some teeth are badly gone as it is and I 'd sure hate to lose any front ones . When I feel the hard dirt of the ball field under my shoes I hear them move away a bit to aim their blows better but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight back because even though my arms are loose they hurt too much and I ca n't see anyway . Just once I do kick out with a foot and hit somebody and as if I 'd done a terrible thing they all pack tight against me again and yelling like a football team we all run over the field . At what I think must be the beginning of the orchard we stop and they move away again and I think maybe they 'll go away now and leave me alone . I rub my eyes and look around and they 're all laughing as if they want me to be a good sport and join them in a joke . Beneath the laughter someone begins a chant . Pupper dog . Pupper dog . Someone picks it up and then another . Pupper dog , pupperp173dog . Now they are all chanting , pupper dog , pupper dog , pupper dog . I try to find enough courage to join them but a sharp pain in my hair stops me . Somebody 's hand forces me to look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black branch with a blacker body swinging on a rope and the spit on my face hides my tears and I think it 's going to snow and rather than join this world of killers and makers of killers I would do anythingeven go crazy because the crazy do n't have to love or hate or feel anything or worry about what they 've said and it took such a long time to get even with Skinny who is only one personso how do I get even with the whole world shouting pupper dog without going crazy but maybe I am already because the people around me mean nothing all that has meaning is gone only the black arms above me have kept even a little bit and the sky today wo n't let them in but the inside of the fat fur now held by the arms has been let in I 'm sure of that surer even than of the fact that I am screaming alone in a cold empty field . D I A R y  --  December 16  --  It 's easy to bounce back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days now I 've stayed mostly in bed . When I do go out no one bothers me . Unlike the time I found Chuck no one important heard my screams . I scared the boys real good and in spite of lots of black and blue marks , a puffed eye , and a missing back tooth that was ready to come out anyway , I feel okay . My jacket and shirt were torn to shreds but Mister Hood gave me a much nicer jacket andp174two new shirts without asking any questions . I heard him yellingat Big Jim but beyond that , nothing . I do n't like Mister Hood any more either . Some new kid came in and now the Mafia is busy initiating him but only by making him do silly things like throwing rocks at nurses or pulling up bushes . Oh well . At least they leave me alone now . I made a long list on how dirty I could be the next time I had to fight Barney but he seems to have forgotten all about me . Darrell came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could hear the others trying to talk to him but he would n't say anything back . He came in to me once and said , hello I 'm sorry for what happenedmy doctor gave me bad news goodbye I 'll see you later . The news must have been bad because he sure looked funny . I 've started making lists in my diary again for the first time since fifth grade . Lists and plans and agendas on how , not just to be better but perfect . There 's not many books around but I think I 've cornered the market . I 'm the only one with a library on my desk . I list them and all the others I can think of that Ishould read . Understanding Biology , The Power of Positive Thinking , Robinson Crusoe , A Closer Study of Freud , How to Make Money in the Stock Market , things like that . I makelong lists on things I should n't do and things I should . I list the number of push-ups and sit-ups I must do every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults along with the few good things to be made better . While doing all this I think of and make lists of movie stars and athletes and school/teachers . And whenever I think I may be carrying things to extremes I remember an Aunt Harriet who was perfect in every way and who kept her house and garden so clean that not a chair or leaf was ever out of place . I always thought it funny that there were never any insects among all those flowers and I thought it funny that every morning she would put a new and neatly folded paper under the cuckoo clock . The memory of her helps to keep a kind of balance to things . I 'm doing now what I did all through the fourth and fifth grades . I did n't use so much code then as I do now . I 'd get pretty mad now but I did n't then when Patrick Manley stole my pages from my desk when I was n't looking and read them to the class with me just sitting there and the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get mad then because it hurt too much . It 's funny . In all the school years with all those teachers I never once saw one leave for the bathroom except for that time . We used to think they had bottles behind and under those big desks , both the men and the women , and we always tried our best to catch them at it but never did . Even though our teacher 's leaving was the first time in our short memories not one kid thought or talked about it later . Their dumb little heads were too full of my careful plans on how to be better . The numberof daily push-ups I must do , how I should act with Dorothy who was the girl in the desk in front of me , how I should change my personality by tomorrow , how I should n't cheat any more during tests , how I should n't ever rob from my aunt 's change purse any more and how I must never again lookp176through the keyhole while she 's changing her dress . There were lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a long time after . I think that 's when it first started . People had always gotten rid of me as soon as possible but now they had a reason . That 's when I started to be different and no one likes one who is different . I seldom talked to anyone exceptGod . Home after home after home and now here but memories never stay at home , they always tag along and grow even worse than what they once were . List after list after plan is written mostly in code but the class-reading of that one is never erased and neither is the reason for having made them in the first place . Prayer on knees and hopes and dreams and writing and rewriting a list or plan has never gotten me an ounce of what I want but how can I stop now . I do n't know what kind of a world it would be if I did n't have to write in code . Today , tonight , and tomorrow may not be worth finding out and yet what else is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I died how would I know for sure . The lonely days go on and on and on . Darrell plays ping-pong with me once in a while and sometimes even smiles at me but almost never talks . I do n't care about the others not talking butp177I wish he would . In spite of what he let them do to me I still like him a lot . I sleep and eat and clean my room and make more lists and think a lot . Sometimes I feel good and sometimes I do n't . Life is easier now but just as confusing . Sometimes when I 'm not feeling quite the same and the loneliness is a little too much and things are different and I am different and sanity seems a little further away than it should , I throw my arms about and my head goes to the left and to the right and if I 'm not careful I connect quite hard with the wall or with the radiator or with the bedposts and it hurts so damn awful bad . These actions last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the dining room someone would ask , where did you get that bump on your head and I would say that I fell down . Then of course they would go away to chatter to someone else about something else and I wish I could join them . Sanity now sometimes takes its leave in strange ways . Once , to escape the cold , I went for a walk in the tunnel and saw a woman coming toward me . At a distance of about six feet she suddenly plopped down on the cement and lifted her skirt in the air with both hands and began to sway . The day had been a pleasant one for me and I felt quite good . I saw right away that this was a very sick person and I knew I should either go past her as quickly as possible or else turn around . I did n't do either . I just stood there , fascinated . She looked like a hooded cobra swaying from side to side . I got the old feeling again but in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slowly ap/proached like some crazy mongoose in a tunnel . My eyes grew large and I bared my teeth . My head followed hers from left to right and back again . She began to moan and move her head faster faster . I walked closer with my head following hers at such a rate that there seemed to be several of them and I becameterrified . But at the same time I longed to destroy them all yet wanted to savor each moment before the fight . I felt the spit flow down my chin . I heard the fast drums behind me . I got close enough to smell the cheap perfume and taste with my lips and teeth the salt of death . Then the drums became footstepsand someone behind me was yelling and the woman was getting up . She smiled as she passed me . I continued on to the Sweet Shoppe . Afterward I would think of such things and would work them out to my own advantage . I would either say that it had n't happened at all or that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they keep those nuts behind bars . Nighttime in an insane asylum . Black windows through which screams travel on the wind to die in my room . Lights going out in the hall . Lights already dimmed and damned by fused wires , blown circuits , nonpayment of bills , going out in many an ugly head in many a darkening building . I hear a childish yell . It is n't mine or from my building . It 's from one of the three white wooden ones in back of mine where the very young stay , the insane ones and the ones nobody wants whichp179is almost the same thing . Young lights go out there , after cookies and milk . Nighttime . Black windows . The roar of the wind competing with the screams , making the branches in the orchard in back of the ball field and the woods in back of the orchard rub together with painful squeakings when old sores reopen . Nighttime . Most of the boys sleep but the Mafia holds one of their nightly meetings to discuss with subdued laughter their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door which makes me jump and if it was n't for the sheets I would 've fallen out of bed . I do n't say anything , hoping whoever it is will go away but Darrell comes in anyway and sits by my feet . We stare at each other in the darkness for a long time . When he speaks I jump again . I 'm sorry about the bad time they gave you . So am I , I say . I 'd like to make it up to you , he says putting a hand on my foot and rubbing with a finger . How . Not here , he says . Not in this place . But where then , I say , glad that he 's here but wishing he 'd go because he sounds so funny . I like you , Timmy . I really do . And I 'm really sorry about what happened . I tried to tell the others I wanted you in the club but they would n't agree to it . I ca n't do anything aboutP180that but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand on you and they listened . That 's why no one 's bothered you in the past few days . Where have you been , I say . I went to court to testify against my mother for killing my father . After what I said they gave her life but they also decided I should be given further tests over the next fucking three months to see if I 'm fit to walk among the normals . But why did you say anything against her , I say . He says nothing . The wind beats against our window . A kid down the hall laughs . The meeting of the Mafia is breaking up to go to bed . The buzzing of smaller more personal meetings is heard from several rooms . Darrell 's hand begins to tremble above my toes . I can barely see his eyes shining in the door light . His hand moves down my foot to my leg and for a moment I almost think him human . I 'm running away in the morning , he says . I think that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm wrong tell me now so I can find someone else . Yes , I say . Yes , yes , yes . I have thirty dollars saved up . I figure we can go through the orchard and woods to the road and catch a bus to some place , to any place as long as it 's a long way from here . Yes . I wo n't tell you where we 're going now but I have some friends there who can help us out with rooms and food andP181maybe even get us jobs . If you 're in with me I want you to tell me now . Yes . And you wo n't back out at the last minute . No , Darrell , I wo n't . I promise . And we 'll be together for a long time . And whatever happens , good or bad , will happen to both of us . Yes , yes . I look again and there 's a squeeze on my leg and a noise in the darkness to tell me that I might have been dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand on that spot and there is no one there but that spot is warm with the chance of leaving and going home or at least getting the fuck away from myself at least for a while . Blackness now in me too and I fall fall into a dream , a most wonderful dream in which somebody likes me because I am the best there is to be and in this dream I throw away the lists and diaries and laugh at those who still make them . . . . Nothing ever did make any sense . Why should now be different . In the morning Darrell knocks on my door and comes in to watch as I dress . We go to breakfast together and nobody bothers to talk to us . After breakfast we go back to our building and pack in small bundles the things we 're going to take . When does a dream end . When it 's over . No . There 's no ending to a wish or to a nightmare because if either ended then there would n't be anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its end and there would n't be a running like a dumb animal past the white wood buildings , past tree after tree of naked winter orchard , over irrigation ditches and mounds of hard earth and dead logs , past iron bars and red bricks and toward who the hell cares . There would n't be the painful whipping of cold wind and branches on our faces and above all there would n't be his laughter when we 're so tired we just have to fall down in a pile of sweet-smelling leaves and laugh together and touch each other and be real friends . With faces uplifted and tears streaming down because of the joy and the cold I see as he sees the sun beyond the black arms , the promise of new leaves and a warmer sun and freedom for us together , above all together , as we go to a town and get a room and maybe a job and begin a planning that needs no diaries or lists . Timmy , he says . We 're out and we never have to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , he says . And everything will be peaches and cream from now on . We 'll have it made . We 'll go to a town and start new lives . We 'll get jobs and no one will ever again tell us what to do or when to eat or when to go to bed or what clubs to join or anything . I know , I say laughing . And there 'll be movies to see and girls to meet and . . . . And beer , he says . All we can drink . I have a friend who 'll buy for us . We 'll celebrate every night and never be sober for more than a few minutes.  |p183We  fall on each other , laughing and rolling in the leaves . We laugh and roll around in the leaves for a long time as if delaying the truth , as if our hands were n't really pawing each other in the way a deer would paw a mound of earth hoping beyond hope there 's something there but knowing there is n't . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he still wants me and we lie there for a while looking at each other , knowing we 've run away but not knowing who with . But there is n't any time to find out because it 's too cold so we get up and run farther into the woods . Soon we hear the noises of the town and run even faster . We reach the road and sit again to catch our breath . Across the road there is a gas station with cars pulling in and out . Two empty lots from it there is a house and then an empty corn field and then a large brown barn . Let 's go over to that barn so we can get warm , Darrell says . But the center of town ca n't be far away , I say . Should n't we go there and catch a bus as soon as possible before anyone finds us missing . I know , Darrell says . But it 's awfully cold . Let 's go to that barn first and talk about what we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees to the opposite side of the barn and when there are n't any cars in sight we jump the ditch and run across the street . At the barn we kick a window open and climb through . The smell of cows and hay is warming and pleasant . The cows do n't seem to mind us at all as we get comfortable inp184one of their stacks of food . Darrell puts his arm around me and begins to tell me of all the wonderful things we 're going to do once we get started . New York and Chicago , he says . San Francisco and New Orleans . Lots of booze and excitement and nothing can separatethe two of us if we play it cool . Yeah , I say . And I 'll never have to get yelled at by another aunt or foster parent . You 'll never have to get yelled at by anybody , he says . You stick with me and we 'll make oodles of money . I know how to make loads of it without lifting a finger . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least not around here , I add after seeing the disapproval in his face . We 're not going to steal , Timmy boy . We 're going to sell and only to the right people , the lovely thing that makes us men . What do you mean , I say . That was one of the many reasons I was in that joint , he says . Why there 're millions of queers in the world who would pay a mint to suck you off . Oh , I say and remember Skinny who never paid a thing exceptmaybe by dying . I do n't think I could do that , I say . Of course you can . It 's easy after the first couple of times . I 've been doing it for almost five years and it never hurt me none.  |p185Okay  , I say . But should n't we be going . Wait a minute , he says pulling on my arm . Let 's talk for a while first . We have time . They do n't care about us . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . I never understoodwhy those guys did n't like you . I did n't either , I say . I wanted them ... . They 're all scum , he says . The whole bunch of them ought to be shot . Why are you in here anyway . I told you before . My foster parents did n't want me any more ... . They 're nothing but a bunch of creeps and I told them that all the time . You know , I 'm in here for many reasons . One of them is that I 'm a perfectionist . I 'm the kind of guy who has to have everything perfect or I start busting heads . I always liked things perfect , I say . Everything going smoothly , a place for everything and ... . The Nazis were like that you know . Boy those were the days . I was born too late and in the wrong country . They were perfectionists too . They did n't have any mental hospitals there . They just shot them , clean and simple . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't . They 'd recognize leadership when they saw it . They 'd need me . Yes , I say . They 'd need you to head the line and show the others where to go . Those were the days . Boy , I would 've had a ball . I 'd haveP186a skull and crossbones in my hat , a black Luger at my belt ... . I think we should be going . There might not be too many buses in this small town . Wait another five minutes , he says . I like you very much , Timmy , and I want us to be together for a long time to come . I do too , I say as he puts his hand on my crotch and rubs hard like Skinny used to only this time I do n't mind . I do n't mind either when he gets real close and undoes my belt and licks my ear and kisses me on the lips and closes over me like night and helps me do again what I did with the sheets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakes up and discovers us and begins to bark . Let 's get out of here , Darrell says , wiping his mouth and running to the window . Wait , I say and jump up after him , zipping my pants and trying to redo my belt at the same time I 'm going out the window . We run down the street . After three blocks we slow down and I finally find the right hole for the buckle . Breathing hard we walk farther into the town . The houses we pass are mostly big wooden ones with wide porches and unfriendly looking doors . Each house has a wide lawn protected by bushes or iron fences . A swoosh of a car makes us jump . So does some little kid banging a front door and running down the steps hollering for Susan to hurry up , her bike 's waiting . Each house seems to have one or more bikes lying down or standing or propped up against the house , waiting . EvenP187Hilda Krantze 's music school has a girl 's red one waiting outsidewhile someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog be hung and if you like me enough to do what you just did why were you so mean to me at first . You know , Darrell says . I once had a little sister . She slept in my bed because our parents were too poor and too stupid and too drunk most of the time to afford any better than a tworoomhouse . They slept in the other room . But each night before they fell asleep they would drink for a while , fight for a while , and fuck for a while . There was n't any door to separate the rooms so we watched and waited each night for them to finish and then although we did n't have anything to drink we had all the other things and we used them to imitate our parents . Each morning four tired , battered , fucked-out people would wake and begin the terrible business of going to school or to work or to a bar . I do n't know what they had but me and my sister , at least we had each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she was dead . It did n't matter much to either of the three of us . A year later father was lying in the spaghetti and it did n't matter . That dog did n't matter either . It was n't my fault if his time had come . Who cares anyway . Another car swooshes by . There 's a stop light ahead and several stores . We must be nearing the main streets of the town . We walk faster , trying to keep warm . And what about me , I say . Do n't I matter.  |p188We  're going to get out of this creepy state , Darrell says . We 're going to get jobs and settle down for a while and make some money and then we 're going to travel all over the country . We 're on one of the main streets now . There 're lots of stores and cars and so many normal people walking around that it seems like a dream . Let 's find out where there 's a bus , I say . Let 's ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a small candy store . And there 's a phone in there . I 'll call my friend and tell him where and when he can meet us . We go through the door and up to the counter . Darrell buys a pack of cigarettes and whispers to me , go ahead , ask him . I gather all my courage and put up my hand to get the fat little guy 's attention , but when he says , yes kid what can I do for you , I just stand there forgetting what I was going to say . While I 'm stuttering the door opens and I turn around and there is Doctor Glucken standing in the middle of the store with his mouth open . Let 's get out of here , Darrell says , going to the door . I followhim to the street and we run wishing old Glucken would stop yelling for us to stop . We run for about five blocks until finally we have to stop . We lean against the window of a grocery store to catch our breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see the cop car pulling over to the curb in front of us . One of the cops rolls down his window and says , hey you two , get the fuck in this car . I guess someone does care after all.  |p189Lying  on the cold grass with my face close to the battleground I watch the friendly green soldiers marching back and forth in the quiet war . From somewhere else a garbage truck grinds , someone screams , someone shouts , a door slams , here comes Darrell . Now that I know him better I 'm glad we were caught but I have a feeling he could n't care less either way . Doctor Glucken cared . In a note he sent to us he said that we embarrassed both him and the hospital and if we ever ran away again he 'd have us put in jail . All the kids laughed when we showed it around and some even talked to me for a while . Darrell 's taken our punishment for running away lightly . I think if they 'd strung him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of him piece by piece until only his thumbs were left swinging on two ropes , he still would n't care , he 'd still be neither happy nor unhappy about anything . The image makes me laugh until I realize that in such a world such things are faintly possible . Do I like him , yes I do . Do I care if he dies tomorrow , no I do n't because he does n't care himself . Good morning , Darrell , I say getting up . Good morning . I 'm glad I 'm going back to the kitchen again , I say . It 's great fun delivering the food carts . I hope we 'll get a chance to go to the girls ' building together , do n't you.  |p190Sure  , he says . Why not . We mop the floors and wash a wall and clean some carts and help to cook a pot of cereal . When the watery cereal has reached a boil Darrell is told to watch so it does n't waste itselfon the stove . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . I rub even harder than I used to becausenow I 'm working with a friend . I 'm proud of the way I make it shine even though I know no one will notice . Most of all I wish Darrell would look up and say something but I know he wo n't . Halfway up the pipe that blows the stink to the outside my rag becomes greasy and I look down from my ladder to ask for another one . I see Darrell pick up a gray strand of mop from the floor and drop it into the cereal . At first I 'm horrified but since he 's my friend my second thought is , I hope no one 's seen him . I look over to the boss and he is staring at Darrell . I think , oh boy , now he 's in for it . But no , the man goes back to breakingegg after egg into a bubbly cauldron of peppers , eggs , and shells . I finish the pipe and throw the rag away and put the ladder back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now beginning to file past the servers . Since I 've lately found out that the easiestway , and maybe the only way , of gaining a friend in this hospital is to be on the serving line so as to give a bigger portion to a favorite I ask the boss but he says no.  |p191You  and your friend start filling up them containers with eggs and cereal , he says . Shall we mix it together , I say . No , he says . Put the eggs in the flat containers of each cart and fill up the deepest containers of each cart with cereal . I was only kidding , I say . He looks at me as if I were crazy . Darrell and I fill up all the carts with the help of the same stupid man who used to go on trips with me before Chuck died . I ask him if he 's been to building K lately and he says , where 's that . I start to tell him where it 's at and why did n't he say hello to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him where he can go . But I stop when I see him taking a little bite out of each bread slice before stacking them on the carts as if he were a poison taster for a royal court . Darrell laughs and I keep looking for that mop strand and thinking , would n't it be wonderfulif I could deliver to Joe 's ward and see the king and queen and all the others again . As each cart is filled the servers take them down the ramp to the tunnel . When only two carts are left the three of us are told to take them to the hospital ward in building F. In a way I 'm relieved that it 's not K because like in a terrible dream my friendship with Joe is over as is the friendship with the kind of madness that sent me there and also the revenging madness that got me out . I do n't really look forward to delivering any/where , except maybe to the girls ' building , but I very much look forward to the look on Darrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horror that I 've seen on this job . Going down the tunnel in back of the other two I pick up the lid that covers the cereal as quietly as possible with one hand and push and guide the cart with the other . I look into the gray and white liquid but I do n't see the mop strand and since I do n't want to embarrass anybody especially myself I put the lid back on and continue . We go up a ramp and into a building I 'd never been to before . Two noisily unlocked doors , one fat nurse who giggles at us , two key-laden attendants and one who I guess is n't trusted with keys , and a lot of hospital stink later we come to a dormitory . Bed after bed on both sides of a forever hall is filled with the sad ugliness of mad minds that have the double misfortune of being dead in dying bodies . We go to each bed and ladle out the same diet to each . I did n't have to come here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in front of one old man , his sheets hiding everything but his head , and we are fascinated by each other , he staring at whatever he sees in me , I staring at the wrinkled , sore-filled face , the yellow-white hair , the two teeth . But then , as I leave him to go to another bed , I look to him again and , fascinated still , he is staring at the same empty air . Bed after bed of bodies containing nothing but broken ,  |p193|pus-filled  , bedbug-feeding pieces of human memory that eat and dirty the linen and eat again and dirty the linen again and stare and laugh and cry and do n't know . Bed after bed of things made of rotting flesh to be fed and now my nose and eyes are trying to convince my stomach it 's time to throw up and I look at Darrell and he has that same damn machine-look about him as if he were a waiter at Howard Johnson 's and I look at the man with us and I 'm about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't because the creature in the bed in front of me is laughing behind his bandages and grabbing at my arm and I need all my strength for pulling away and keepingmy own sanity and not for asking questions that would n't be answered anyway and one of the attendants comes over and pries the dirty fingers from my arm saying , now now pukeface , hands are only for eating and wiping and not for touchingpretty little boys , and I look again to the stone face of my friend and I want to scream , for God 's sake , Darrell , have you no pity , no anger , no smiles ; have you nothing inside you at all . I throw up just a little bit after the attendant is gone and I 'm quite ashamed but as soon as it hits the floor a patient hops out of bed to clean it up with a pair of shorts as if the whole thing were expected and quite the normal thing to do . Down on his knees the poor old man scrubs with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as if hoping for another . But I hold my breath so I wo n't do it again and he smiles at me in such a normal way and I 'm so grateful for his human actions that Ip194help him up and after he 's carefully put the shorts back under his bed and climbed between his sheets I give him an extra bowl of cereal . Going down the tunnel again I realize I never did find that mop strand . I guess somebody ate it . In the kitchen we clean up some carts and mop the floor . When we 're done Darrell sits down to eat and I drink a little milk and then we go out to the lawn . The lawn is still green and the air is cold and clear and there 's a little ice on the edges of the stream and look , Darrell , a snowflake and there 's another and another and I say , it 's the first snow of the winter . I hope it snows so much we need skis to go to the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then maybe we wo n't have to work . Sure , I think to myself . I wanted you to enjoy our job togetherbut you do n't . I wanted someone to explain to me about the things in the beds and the things in the violent wards and why some people do n't care about them but you do n't either . I wanted someone to like the first snow even if he hated all the others and to tell me the difference between the first and the last but there is n't anyone . But I guess a life of disappointment is n't hurt by one sentence or by one more day and neither is a friendship . Especially when one has only one life and one friend . A flake hits the water and is seen by a duck who thinks it is a good thing and he too is fooled and he laughs at himselfP195and swims back under the bridge to his family . More snow falls , the flakes get bigger , and the air becomes filled with the clean beauty of something different but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did . Let 's go to that old building they 're tearing down in back of the ball field , I say . Someone told me there are real chains on the walls and that there 's a dungeon beneath it where they used to keep the inmates . Okay , he says . There 's nothing else to do . We walk across the lawn that is now becoming white . We pass our building and walk over the ball field . The jagged shell in front of us that the summer workmen had left looks like a gray penciled drawing against the white falling sky . The red frames and bricks of the main doorway had not yet been hit by the hammers . The untouched blackness of the opening at first stops us but once we peer inside and discover the light pouring through broken bricks we decide that there are no demons or ghosts inside to harm us . C'm on , I say . Let 's explore . We go inside and I 'm happy to be the leader even though I know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our eyes to see anything so at first we just stand inside in quiet darkness hoping the bricks will let more light through . It does , floating down on the dancing dust our shoes have thrown . Beneathus is a dirt floor and around us are brick walls that will crumble soon even if the workmen never come back . We go through a door to another room and it is the same . Ancient dust and brick and a ceiling of rotten wood that separates usp196from the second and third floors which are probably the same also . We go through another door . The room before us takes a long time to see . Even though Darrell does n't tell me I know we are playing a game to see which of us can see whatever is in the room first . Because he must win at all costs , because he 's strained his eyes to see , and because I let him , he wins . Just another four walls , he says . I do n't think we better go any farther . Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We go over to see and stumble in the soft stuff that is piled all around the large room . Darrell picks up a handful . It 's hops , he says . It 's bags and bags of hops and some of them have been broken . Now is n't that something . What in the world are hops , I say . He looks at me as if I were a fool and says , why that 's the main ingredient in beer you fool . Oh , I say . Have you ever tasted beer . Before I can confess he tells me of the greatness of beer and how they must 've once made their own to give to the inmatesin place of coffee and milk and how we too can make some as soon as we can steal some malt and yeast and water and salt from the kitchen . His eyes light up and I see from them and I hear from his voice that some things do interest him beside running away and my body , and I become very happy and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me get sick on so that I would n't turn out to be a drunkard.  |p197We  carefully gather a few of what he considers to be the best of the brown brittle leaves and we put them in a corner to wait until we 've got the rest of the recipe . When we 're done he falls down on the main pile of ripped burlap and spilled leaves and pulls me down beside him . We 're still going to get out of here together , he says . Yes . And I still like you more than anyone else in the world , he says . I know . Whispering so low I ca n't hear him he rubs his hand hard all over my body and finally decides to rest it on my belt . I close my eyes and I feel my buckle loosen and my zipper go down and then everything else and I feel his mouth closing over me like he did in the barn and . . . . from the blackness of the doorway an even darker shadow speaks . Hello you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared that it might be a ghost or even worse , an attendant . I turn around and fix my pants . What the heck you doing in there , it says . Darrell sighs in relief . It 's only a little boy , he says . What do you mean , only a little boy , the shadow in the door says indignantly . Darrell laughs . My heart begins to quiet . What were you doing in here anyway , the boy says . Darrell stops laughing . Go away kid , he says . We do n't need you here.  |p198No  , the boy says and at first I do n't know to which he 's agreed to . I have as much right here as you , he says . And besides , I saw what you were doing . I said go away , get out of here , Darrell says , his voice rising . No , the boy says in a sure , quiet voice . There 's more to this building than just three rooms you know . Would you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think you would , the boy says . No one ever does want to . Darrell moves forward . He does n't look angry but I can sense he is . If you do n't go away I 'm going to bash your head , he says . And that 's a promise . I never believed in promises , the boy says , his voice absent of fear . Before Darrell can go further I reach out and touch his shoulder . C'm on , I say . Let him stay until he gets bored and goes . He ca n't do us any harm . Darrell sighs and sits down again staring at the door . The boy enters our darkness . I 'm not afraid of you or anybody else , he says pointing at Darrell who is now lying back on the hops with his eyes closed . Do n't you know who he is , I say not knowing what else to say . Sure , the boy says . He 's one of the leaders of the Mafia from the big kids ' building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm the fastest runner you ever saw . P199Shuffling closer he walks toward us . The first thing I noticeis he has no laces on shoes that make flopping sounds with each step . A dusty beam of light hits him in the face . He has a child 's baby-fat face , neither pretty nor ugly and all eyes . The kind of face no one sees unless it is staring right at you . His small body is wrapped in a heavy sweater that goes almost to his knees . He walks like a fat little puppet to the strings of a proud master . He 's about ten or eleven years old and even though I wish he were n't here I like him . Darrell gets up and says , let 's go . When we get the stuff we 'll come back . What stuff , the boy asks . It 's none of your business , Darrell says . I saw what you were doing , the boy says . Without saying anything we both move toward him and he quickly backs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once out of the building and blinking in the snowy sunlight we look around for the boy but he 's gone . We forget about him and walk in the snow to our building while planninghow to make the beer and getting good and drunk . Lunch comes and goes with us only cleaning up the kitchen and not going on any trips and I 'm not a bit disappointedand neither is Darrell but for a different reason . He seems to have forgotten the boy and what the boy had interruptedand only talks of beer and of running away again some day , this time for good . As I 've done before I try to tellp200him about Cindy and the other girls but he does n't seem to want to hear . I try to tell him about the violent wards in buildingK but he says I made them up , that life is bad enough withoutmaking things up . I tell him that maybe we 'll get a chance to deliver to K and then he can see for himself and he says that maybe we 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soup . I tell him that would n't be very nice and he says , why not , and I tell him that I think the women 's building has their own kitchen but I do n't think he hears me because he 's too busy looking for a milk bottle and some yeast . While I scrub the incoming carts and carry their dirty containers to the sinks so the colored container washer can wash them I hope to hell the bottle is to be for the beer and not to be broken for soup . But I now know that with him anything is possible and that I 'll have to watch him closely from now on . I also know that even though he is my best and only friend I do n't like him so much any more . Between the time of lunch and supper I find I like him even less but need him more . We sit and talk for a long while on the top bunk of my bed with our backs against the wall . He does most of the talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he hated his father , how we 're going to make some beer and run away and start new lives . I say things he does n't hear such as I do n't think we should do again what we did before and what 's a slut and what does the Mafia think about us being friends and . . . . I realize he only hears what he wants to and even then he usually disagrees with it . Once ,
