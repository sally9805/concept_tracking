The 500 tractors Fidel Castro demanded as ransom for 1,200 imprisoned Cuban survivors of the Bay of Pigs invasion were ready , and the Tractors-for-Freedom Committee , headed by Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt . Walter Reuther and Dr. Milton Eisenhower , was prepared to deliver them to the Cuban dictator in lots of 100 . The committee still had no visible funds to pay for the tractors , but hoped to find them in 25,000 unopened letters . If and when Castro agreed to the deal , the committee would open the letters . But in order to pay the $16 million tab , each letter would have to contain a donation of $640 . <P> Even as the envelopes piled up . so did the furor over the Kennedy-backed deal . Richard Nixon denounced the trade-which , he warned , could be completed only " at the cost of increasing the power of the tyrant . " Mississippi 's Representative John Bell Williams introduced a bill that would make the proposed swap a federal offense , punishable by $5,000 fine , three years in prison . Wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I have been sick to my stomach with shame . " <P> But there were still many who supported the plan on humanitarian grounds . The committee reported a sudden surge of 10,000 letters ( and presumed donations ) after an emotional appeal by TV 's Jack Paar , who was a onetime ardent admirer of Castro 's . Fund-raising drives were under way in eleven Latin American countries , and the New York Times 's Tad Szulc reported an " ever-so-rare spectacle of Latin American public opinion being aroused against Premier Fidel Castro and in favor of the United States . ' ' <P> In the hubbub of conflicting opinions , only one voice was silent . Fidel Castro , who has never been known to shrink from public speech , had not been heard from for two weeks . The frustrated committee finally sent an ultimatum to Havana , gave Castro until midweek to accept its offer or call the whole thing off .
