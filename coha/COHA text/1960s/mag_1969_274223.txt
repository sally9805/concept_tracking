For the third time in little more than three months , a coup d ' tat shook the Arab world last week . Hard on the upheavals in the Sudan and South Yemen , leftist army officers in Libya seized the oil-rich kingdom of King Idris and proclaimed " the Libyan Arab Republic " with the Nasser-style slogan , " Freedom , Unity , Socialism . " <P> The coup in Libya ( see following story ) reduced the number of reigning Arab monarchs to three , and only one of them seems reasonably secure-Morocco 's King Hassan II . Jordan 's Hussein is under pressure from Palestinian commandos , who use his territory as a base , and from Israeli retaliation . Saudi Arabia 's King Feisal forestalled a coup by young air force officers only six weeks ago . Since then , he reportedly jailed hundreds of plotters and condemned 30 to death by beheading . <P> More significant than the relentless shrinkage in royal regimes is the fact that the shift in Libya gives the 14-nation Arab League a leftist majority for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conservative states-or , as the leftists put it , between the " free Arabs " and the " kept Arabs . " Now there are eight left-leaning states ( Egypt , Iraq , Syria , Algeria , Sudan , the two Yemens and Libya ) , and six conservative governments that accept Western support and admit Western influence ( the three kingdoms , plus Lebanon , Kuwait and Tunisia ) . <P> Though the League now has a clear-cut majority , it is no nearer to unity as a result . While the tanks were rolling in Libya , an Arab summit of sorts was assembling in Cairo under the leadership of President Nasser . Algeria 's President Houari Boumedienne described the main subject of discussion as " the battle of destiny " - the campaign against Israel . The secret talks were aimed at finding ways of better coordinating operations of the units from eight Arab armies that are arrayed ( or rather disarrayed ) along Israel 's frontiers . <P> Even so , only four other countries saw fit to send representatives . Jordan 's Hussein was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atassi . Iraq sent only a Deputy Premier because of its quarrel with Syria over the true interpretation of Baathist socialism , but Sudan sent its new ruler , Major General Jaafar Nimeiry . The oil-soaked Kuwaitis , Saudis and Libyans , who already donate $378 million a year to war-damaged Egypt and Jordan , stayed away , lest they be touched for even bigger donations . Sure enough , the leaders at the mini-summit made a blunt demand for more money , declaring that " present economic aid is considered less than what is needed . "
