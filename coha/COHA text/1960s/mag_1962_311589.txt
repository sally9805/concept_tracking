It was enough to give a motorcycle cop ulcers . On the slick asphalt pavement , the cut-down , exhaust-blatting hot rods stood poised for takeoff . Hunched over steering wheels , leather-masked drivers squinted through their goggles as the crowd shouted : " Stripe it , Chevy ! " " Twist him off ! " At the signal , the cars roared away-but not to the wail of a police siren . In Pomona , Calif. , last week , the country 's foremost hot-rodders were holding their Winternational Drag Racing championships before 39,000 cheering auto buffs . <P> Strip Off the Bumpers . Drag racing , that dangerous pastime of speed-happy youngsters , has grown up a bit in the last few years . Most of the Pomona fans were still teenagers , easily identified by their headgear-fezzes. derbies , top hats , brightly chromed World War II helmets - and far-out chatter : " Man , look at that screamer . Like that 's sudden iron . " * But the 300 drivers who competed for the coveted title of ' ' Top Eliminator " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoom through traffic and terrorize motorists . A few were professional racers ; the majority were serious , mechanically inclined young men who belong to the National Hot Rod Association and test their creations in a relatively sane manner . They pay scrupulous attention to traffic laws ( a ticket may mean suspension from their hot-rod club ) , restrict their racing to " drag strips " - the runways of abandoned airports , blocked-off roads , or isolated tracks . <P> The Pomona cars were masterpieces of mechanical ingenuity . Most had once been stock Detroit or foreign coups , roadsters , and sedans . But no auto dealer would recognize them now . They all mounted mammoth , supercharged power plants-a 650-h.p . Chrysler engine in a 1932 Ford ( standard h.p. : 60 ) , a 545-h.p . Chevrolet engine in a Volkswagen ( standard h.p. : 45 ) . Front-engine cars had their engines moved back on the frames to increase traction ; useless headlights , bumpers , fenders , fans and fan belts were removed to lighten weight . Gear and axle ratios were changed for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cut down to lower the center of gravity . Such rebuilding is costly ( $1,500 to $10,000 ) , but the results are spectacular : speeds up to 175 m.p.h. ; quarter-mile sprints in less than 9 sec . <P> And a Parachute Too . At Pomona , the National Association 's top hot-rodders raced against each other and against a clock . Two by two , in a series of elimination heats , they " herded " their cars over a straight quarter-mile run , tested both acceleration and top speed as they were clocked through the same sort of electronic trap that cops use to nab speeders . Fastest of all were the Class AA dragsters , driven by such seasoned campaigners as 28-year-old Pete Robinson , an auto-parts manufacturer from Atlanta , who is the current U.S. champion . Stripped to the bare essentials-a naked steel frame , a bucket seat , racing tires , a " go pedal , " and sometimes a drag parachute for braking-the " Double A-ers " are such specialized machines that they can not even get started without a push . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
