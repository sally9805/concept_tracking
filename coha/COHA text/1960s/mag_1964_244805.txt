The heavyweights are everybody 's heroes , with their tomato-red Cadillacs and gold-lam sport coats , their 18-in. biceps and sledgehammer fists . When they fight , the whole world watches . So what happens ? One punch , and it 's goodbye Charley , let 's do this again next year . It does n't even seem to matter where the punch lands : Cassius Clay taps Sonny Listen on the arm , and Sonny takes the pipe sitting on his stool . <P> Humbug . For old-fashioned prizefighting , nothing beats the welterweights . Take Emile Griffith and Luis Rodriguez , both 146 Ibs. , soaking wet . Griffith , a soft-spoken Virgin Islander , makes ladies ' hats ; Rodriguez , a Cuban refugee , sings Yiddish songs in nightclubs . But when they meet in the ring , as they did for the fourth time in Las Vegas last week , anything goes . <P> Rarely have two fighters been so evenly matched . Twice before , they had traded the welterweight title on controversial decisions , one of them split ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . But they insisted that things were going to be different this time . " I am the matador , " boasted Challenger Rodriguez , 26 , " and I will kill the black bull . " That brought accusations of race-raking , to which Rodriguez retorted : " I should call him maybe the blue bull ? " Champion Griffith , 25 , shrugged it off : " I 'll knock him out in five . " <P> <P> Both should have known better . For 15 frantic rounds , Griffith and Rodriguez pummeled , wrestled , gouged and butted each other-amid bloodcurdling screams from Griffith 's mother , who was sitting at ringside . In the third round , Referee Harry Krause penalized Rodriguez for punching below the belt , and Rodriguez ' manager , Angelo Dundee , chased Krause clear across the ring . " What are you doing , Harry ? " he yelled . " Remember the other guy is fouling , too ! " How could he forget ? In the clinches , Griffith raked Rodriguez ' face with the laces of his glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . Three times the two fighters kept slugging after the bell . <P> Referee Krause scored it 69-67 for Griffith ; Judge David Zenoff had it 71-70 Rodriguez ; Judge John Romero 70-68 Griffith . By the narrowest of split decisions , Griffith had kept his crown . Said Luis : " If I ca n't win this title back , I 'll just have to win the middleweight championship instead . "
