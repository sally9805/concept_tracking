DECEMBER 20 , 1969 News From Toyland by Stanford N. Sesser There are going to be some quite unexpected surprises under the Christmas tree for thousands of unsuspecting children . Toys that heat and bake , talk and teach , rattle and whir are also going to burn , cut , maim , electrocute . Parents who assumed their children were protected by some sort of safety code will discover that safety depends solely on the good will of the manufacturer . Take the Empire Little Lady Oven ( $9.95 ) . This child 's stove , which plugs in and cooks by heating coils just like mommy 's stove , reaches a ternperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit on the sides , Sao degrees on top and 66o degrees inside the oven , according to tests by Consumer Reports . By contrast , most kitchen ranges wo n't get hotter than i8o degrees on the non-cooking surfaces . After a little search , the lucky parent might find a warning on the Little Lady Oven ? underneath the stove , punched into the recessed metal bottom in hard7to-read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause burns . " Some parents might shy away from a child 's stove but few are going to think twice about buying " New , Improved Baby 's Delight , " a 49 cent rattle that makes chime-like noises . The rattle , in pink and blue colors , pictures baby contentedly sucking his thumb . Peel away this paper picture and you have a cardboard cylinder enclosing the rattle mechanism . Peel or smash open the cardboard and you find underneath seven sharp and rusty exposed metal spikes fastened securely to the rattle 's base . An estimated 350,000 of these chime rattles will be sold in the United States this year at Woolworth 's and other stores . Surprisingly , the rattle really is " new and improved . " On the previous model , the spikes could penetrate the outer covering simply by pushing the rattle against a wall . Toys like this ? and there are dozens of examples ? are n't going to make parents who find out about them very happy with the degree of free enterprise allotted to the toy industry by Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the National Commission on Product Safety held hearings on hazardous toys . The logical solution is of course a government agency that would test and clear toys in an operation similar to that of the Food and Drug Administration . The idea of the government protecting the consumer in that clear-cut a manner is apparently still too radical a concept however , and last spring Congress went to work on the next best thing : a bill proposed by the Product Safety Commission giving the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare broad powers to yank hazardous toys off the market . Then the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc. spun into action . The position of the toy makers on the controversy was clearly stated in the Product Safety Commission hearings by Richard J. Manuell , child safety consultant for the National Safety Council , which claims to work with the industry in developing safe toys . Mr. Manuell declared that " a child has to experience some minor injuries , some minor experiences of trauma in order to learn . " Aaron Locker , counsel for the Toy Manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost tempted to remark that if we wanted to be completely safe , maybe we should stay in bed . " The Toy Manufacturers hired some powerful voices to weaken the proposed Congressional bill , and their lobbying paid off . Under the Product Safety Commission 's proposals , the HEW Secretary could have banned from sale such items as toy stoves which present an inherent risk rather than a hazard-producing defect . Under the final bill , according to the Toy Manufacturers ' Mr. Locker , the Secretary is powerless to act " if the toy is properly labeled and the alleged hazard is required by the function of the toy . " Consumers Union , the non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports , sums up what is wrong with the bill . " The great shortcoming of the act , " says a CU spokesman , " is that products that maim , burn or cripple children can still find their way onto the market . A cynic might say that the manufacturer who is n't particularly concerned can carry out research on children instead of in his laboratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toy Safety Act of 1969 to final passage . " We found there were no problems shown which necessitated enactment of the bill , " says Mr. Locker . " But we welcomed legislation which formally prohibited hazards in toys . We recognized the wave of consumerism we 're in . " The minimal amount of protection provided by the bill wo n't be felt this Christmas in any case . The measure , signed by President Nixon last month , does n't take effect until January . Meanwhile , widely available toys include the following : Mirro Miniature Electric Corn Popper : Several thousand will be sold in the United States this year despite a finding in late 1968 by Consumer Reports that the toy poses a dangerous shock hazard . If the popper is cleaned with a sponge or a damp cloth , as it 's supposed to be , the magazine 's testers found that water could enter the unit and make it live . In addition , after 22 minutes the corn popper reached a temperature of 50o degrees inside , 35o degrees on the side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirro Aluminum Co. , the Wisconsin-based manufacturer , says the product was approved by Underwriters ' Laboratories , an independent testing organization . The company also points out that the toy 's instruction booklet warns : " Caution : do not leave a popper that is plugged in unattended . Overheating can result in a fire hazard . In cleaning , never immerse popper in water as this can damage heating unit . " " A child from 7 to 12 would have a lot of fun with this , " says Frank Prescott , a Mirro vice president . ? Etch-a-Sketch : This is one of the most popular toys in the nation , with 20 million sold in the last decade . Made by Ohio Art Co. , Bryan , Ohio , it consists of a glass sheet in an open box , with a layer of aluminum powder covering the underside of the glass . By turning two knobs , a child can move a stylus which scrapes away the powder and makes visible lines . Many parents who buy the toy assume the sheet is made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips and falls on Etch-a-Sketch . The DECEMBER 20 , 1969 Product Safety Commission has in its files eight complaints by parents whose children were cut by the glass , some severely . And a Minneapolis lawyer who did research on the toy charges that the gray powder leaves a permanent tatoo when it gets into the cuts . Po- Rapco Metal Casting Set ( Rapco Inc. , Chicago ) : Basically a cooking stove designed to melt lead , which can then be poured into molds , it reaches the incredible temperatures of Soo degrees on the cooking surface and boo degrees on the sides . Nowhere is this men- tioned , on the box or in the instruction booklet . The only warning is : " Be sure to wear gloves and handle figures with pliers or other tool . " Manufacturers seem to delight in playing games with their warnings . One widely sold toy stove , called " Magic Cool Oven " ( Argo Industries Corp. , New York ) , boasts in large letters on the package , " Outside Safe for Little Fingers to Touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oven is the warning : " Caution , contact with hands inside of oven or inside 0f cooling chamber may cause burns . " Then , . on the back of the stove , punched sideways into the copper-colored metal , is a further warning : " Remove plug before cleaning . Do not , immerse in water . Clean with damp cloth only . " The child who assumes the name " Magic Cool " means that the oven wo n't heat up is in trouble . 1110- Last year a product was widely advertised on television called " Super-Dough with Super-Glo " ( Hassenfeld Bros . Inc. , Providence , R.I. ) , a glob of plastic impregnated with a chemical that glows in the dark . The package illustrated little children with gobs of Super-Dough stuck to their foreheads , cheeks and chins.13 The instruction booklet warned , " Never , never put superdough into or over your eyes , ears , nose or mouth . PP- Dangerous dolls : A walk through the doll department of any toy store will disclose any number of dolls with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? pins that can easily be pulled out by a baby . If that does n't pose enough of a hazard , sometimes the eyes of a doll or stuffed animal are attached to the end of a pin , which is then pushed into the head . The US Public Health Service estimates that 700,000 children a year are injured in accidents involving toys . While toy executives vocally insist the number of injuries actually caused by hazardous ' toys is tiny and insignificant , the toy industry has steadfastly refused to compile accident figures . Nor will the toy industry say how much is spent on safety . A year ago the Product Safety Commission got a promise from the Toy Manufacturers ' Mr. Locker that he would supply safety figures for the association 's 300 members . Now Mr. Locker says , " We 've been frankly unable to compile them . " In the face of this wall of silence on the safety issue , a parent wondering how to select safe toys has a real problem . A good start is to avoid anything that plugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges . Dolls and stuffed animals have to literally be , pulled apart on the shelves in a search for pins and spikes ? the retailer wo n't do it himself . " We ca n't take every toy and break it apart , " says Charles W. Veysey , president of FAO Schwarz . " We carry 12,000 different items . There are between 150,000 and 200,000 toys on the market to choose from . We have to rely on the manufacturer 's integrity . "
