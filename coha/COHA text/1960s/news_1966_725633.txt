txt Letters to the Editor of The Times Letters to the Editor of The Times Racism Charge in Vote for Surrogate Refuted To the Editor : As abominable as racial or religious prejudice is , to accuse someone falsely of being guilty of either is worse . In the recent campaign for surrogate of New York County the leader of Tammany Hall asserted that Senator Robert F. Kennedy 's sole reason for supporting Justice Samuel J. Silverman was to oust the leader because he is a Negro . The refutation of racism the Harlem voters gave to the Tammany leader and others who attempted to mislead them on this specious issue in order to gain political advantage for themselves was one of the most wholesome ' things that occurred in the election . Justice Arthur Klein , who was supported by the leader of Tammany Hall , the promulgator of the racist charge , received only a three-to-two majority in Harlem . It was feared by some of Judge Silverman 's supporters that because the Tammany Hall leader had raised the false issue of race , Justice Klein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one . The truth is , some political observers believe , if a stronger campaign had been waged in Harlem for Justice Samuel Silverman , he would have carried it . The employment of racism in an election at any time , but especially when it is nonexistent , is a dangerous thing , It can only stir up discord and leave scars for years to come . The leader of Tammany Hall and his close ally , Dr. Kenneth Clark , did their best to put over on the public this canard . That , they failed is a tribute to the intelligence of the Negro voters . Struggle for Advantage Unfortunately , while such civil rights leaders as the Rev. Martin Luther King are fighting for integration and abjuring the concept of " black power , " some Negro politicians , in order to maintain their own peanut political kingdoms , are continuing to fight for Jim Crow . They assume that a segregated Negro vote will give them security and enable them to use it to their own advantage whenever the occasion would arise . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be segregated residentially , he is not when he enters the polling booth to cast his vote . He has invariably voted against boSsism and for political liberalism and change just as the rest of the electorate in the city has done . In the history of American politics , whites have voted for Negroes against white candidates , and Negroes have voted for whites against Negro candidates . As long as this continues , America , including the Negro Americans , stands to ? gain . Let us hope that in New ' York no politician , regardless of his race , will be able successfully to play one group of voters against another , as is done in some sections of the South . EARL BROWN New-York , July 5 , 1966 The writer was formerly Deputy President of the Borough of Manhattan . ? Income Guarantee To the Editor : A committee appointed by Congress " to study the Federal system of public welfare " has just recommended ( Times June 30 ) that a minimum income of $3,200 be guaranteed each family of four in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in appropriations by the several states . This project , according to Dr : Fedele Fauri , chairman of the committee , would raise Federal welfare expenditures from $4 to $9 billion yearly . One disquieting feature in this report is its apparent indifference to inflationary threats resulting from the addition of $5-billion to present governmental costs . When any government controls the money supply as much as ours does , it becomes much easier to turn the spigot on in favor of welfare projects than to turn it off . The knell of republican forms of government and the rise of fascist dictatorships have not uncommonly followed when the practice of increasing handouts became politically irreversible . Publication of this news item by The Times on its obituaryypage may therefore prove unconsciously prophetic . FRANK LIST Brewster , Mass. , July 4 , 1966 Legislators ' Raise , Medicaid Cut Assailed To the Editor : The Times of July 6 carried , in the same story , two items that point up a classic example of fiscal hypocrisy which spotlighted the glaring double standard our state legislators employ when dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature boosted its salaries by 50 per cent while amending the Medicaid law to require families earning $4,500 or less to pay part of their medical expenses before receiving state help . I have no objection to the raises , particularly since the State Legislatures ' sessions have become regularly extended . But to vote for these increases and then , in effect , vote to snatch $80 from the pockets of families who take home between $4,500 and $6,000 a year in the next , borders on the incredible . New York State took a giant step toward a form of national health insurance when the Medicaid bill became law . It is now only a ' matter of time before the United States catches up with the rest of the Western world and enacts legislation that will enable all our people to receive adequate medical care . It is unfortunate that the Legislature knuckled under to the medical lobby to take this step backward under such shabby circumstances . DAN GREENBERG Westbury , N. Y. , July 6 , 1966 ? France 's Bomb To the Editor : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news media that members of SANE and Ban the Bomb have been picketing at the United Nations and French Embassies around the world , protesting France 's recent hydrogen bomb explosion . These organizations have always been eager to protest any United States action . Why this strange silence in regard to France ? HELEN R. SPRINGBORN Bronxville , N. ' Y. , July 7 , 1966 ? Briton Protests War To the Editor : A recent , program on B.B.C. TV in which we saw victims , legless , shattered and bereaved , has brought home to even the most insensitive , unthinking viewer in my country the utter vileness and wickedness of this " undeclared " war . The spectacle of the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world devastating human beings and the countryside of another country in order to preserve " freedom " for those people and freedom from the possibility of Communism for itself is one of the greatest hypocrisy . Have you no confidence in the American way of life ? There can be no person of any decency who can agree with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent person can agree with our Government 's condonation of this war . We can only hope that the world is not set alight by this lunacy . VERA DELF Yoxford , Suffolk , Eng . June 29 , 1966 Navy Yard 's Use for Industry Hailed To the Editor : It is welcome news that the city plans to acquire the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a site for new industry . It could be relatively easy to allocate all of the Navy Yard land to eager tenants . But the problem is not how quickly to dispose ! of the land , but how to do it creatively from the standpoint of helping the city 's economy . In the selection of tenants , it seems to me that preference should be given to those industries which : Make high capital investments for equipment ; Pay high wages , and , if possible , have a high value added by manufacture ; Are nonseasonal and none cyclical and are primarily related to the normal  --  not mililary  --  economy ; Are not solely dependent on sales to New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faintain substantial THESE STARS DISTRACT They are playing chamber music in the courtyard , But my eyes are drawn up . wards , above the walls Of thick stone , above the fountain upon a grotto , To the vast rectangle of starlit sky beyond ; Measured against infinity such slender notes Are like the lonely call of a blackbird across snow . My ears hear but my mind listens to the silence Of the stars ; how familiar they are , yet how remote , More unattainable than , veined peaks that thrust glistening Through untrodden snow , yet more desirable to restless Men and up there now a manmade star is moving ; Slowly crossing the rectangle from west to east . Unbound again Prometheus is probing the sky , To snatch what secrets , incur what new anguish ? You would have delighted in it , Leonardo , But others will die like your flying boy bef ore Men walk on Mars and Venus and if they do Will they still be men in . the image of Adam ? ROSEMARY JOSEPH white-collar establishments ? as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brewing , construction and public utilities , much of the city 's bluecollar , employment , is in lowcapitalization , low-wage , small , marginal , industries . Unless this situation can be changed , there is little likelihood of improvement either in the city 's tax base or in the condition of mass poverty from which we suffer . High capital investment will , by reducing the ratio of direct labor cost , enable New York to compete with other centers. , Efficient production creates , employment opportunities in ' the companies and in the general economy . Once industry makes a high capital investment in its production facilities , it can take full advantage of New York 's attractions as a market . It can also benefit from the printing , packaging , advertising , engineering , legal , financial , entertainment ; education and research services and snbcontracting facilities uniquely available in . New ' York and at the same time encourage their growth . To Recapture Industries New York has lost strong companies and . replaced Went ' with marginal companies paying low wages . This process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change can be expected . Business lead= ership has heard too much about high wages ( untrue ) , high taxes , impenetrable traffic , featherbedding , petty harrassment by public employes . Yet there are numerous industries , which , properly apprised of the true breadth of the opportunity , might make meaningful capital investments at the former Navy Yard . I have in mind especially the metalworking industries , including machine tools , automotive , marine , earth moving and construction equipment , office machinery and equipment and components and equipment for nuclear applications . The location might also be an attractive one for manufac- ! turers of heavy electrical and chemical . apparatus . Not to be overlooked is the possibility of attracting a major printing facility . Chicago has a Donnelley . Why not New York ? New Yorkers are excited by the prospect of a great waterfront industrial center in Brooklyn . Let us hope those in charge can meet the challenge . I. D. ROBBINS New York , July .7 , 1966 ? Rochester 's Fare To the Editor : May I correct an erroneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William M. ' Setek Jr . of Manlius , N. Y. Mr. Setek stated that people in Rochester pay between 25 and . 40 cents for public transportation . The fact is that we ? have an adult token rate of 19 cents , the lowest fare in any major city in New York State , as well as . a 25-cent cash fare , WILLIAM A.
