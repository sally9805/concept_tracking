A CAB AT THE DOOR by V.S. Pritchett. 244 pages . Random House . $5.95 . <P> <P> Still another totally recalled English boyhood ? One more sensitive child of privilege weaning himself from old Nanny and stumbling gamely onto the fields of Eton ? Not at all . V.S. ( for Victor Sawdon ) Pritchett 's brilliantly belligerent account of his first 20 years is about as far as a memoir can get from the usual look-back-in-languor . <P> Heretofore , Pritchett 's eminence has derived from his travel articles and books , his suavely ironic short stories and his book reviews ( mostly for Britain 's New Statesman ) , which make him a rival of Edmund Wilson as the best literary critic in the English language . Now an angry old man of 67 , Pritchett vents some of the redbrick ferocity of early Osborne or Amis-though with more elegance-as he writes of the genteel poverty and violent lower-middle-class life that he survived . <P> Marriage for young Victor 's parents was a lifelong state of war in which the children were hostages . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeky cockney girl . " Temperamentally they were even farther apart . Father was an optimist , a dandy " walking in and out of jobs with the bumptiousness of a god . " By the time Victor was twelve , the cab at the door had moved the Pritchetts 18 times . While Mother wept , Father filled those cabs with his bland bass voice . <P> <P> Oh , dry those tears <P> Oh , calm those fears <P> Life will be brighter tomorrow . <P> Sadistic Touch . Singing extroverts make popular parents . Victor loved his " cocksparrow " father once , and laconically concedes , " He charmed . " But he delivers his prevailing opinion with icy finality " I hated my father . " So deeply , in fact , that he had to hate what his father loved : " big men " ( that is , those with money ) , nice " Things " ( Father ended up in the " art needlework " business ) , and Christian Science . <P> Hating Father did not mean loving Mother . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close but unloving family . What they had instead of love was intensity . Thus Grandfather Pritchett , a minister , " looked like a sergeant major who did not drink . " He beat his carpets and his sons with " a genial sadistic touch . " Pritchett concludes that his own father was partly playing the pass-on-the-pain game . ( Authors who have suffered Pritchett 's critical thrashings may believe the same of him . ) <P> Room at the Top . One day , sitting in a tree reading Moliere , young Pritchett made his spiritual getaway when a voice announced to him : " You are a skeptic . " At 16 , he happily went to work as an office boy in the leather trade . Here he adopted a surrogate father named Hobbs , who was cynical , glamorously debauched , and gauntly full of death . After four years , he went to live in Paris , and eventually moved into a writing career via journalism . Could any young man more convincingly escape a family trap ? Yet just as they obsessed each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
