 |p493  I RECKON it 's just across this bay and around the next mountain ! " shouted Nance , clutching the soggy chart in one hand and the rigging with the other , while the Cristoden jumped and bounced . And how far 's that , please ? " " Quarter of an inch on this chart ! " she yelled against the wind . But what a quarter of an inch ! The wind howled and the rain drove and the sea , fretful and breaking , was throwing the little ship all over the place . Great sprays drove over us all , gathered by the wheel . No sooner had we crossed that bay than another bay and yet another mountain came into gloomy view , and the rain swept down in torrents . Our fat ex-Dutch botter , a sort of yacht built on barge lines , was bucking like a bad-  |p494  tempered bronco as she staggered along the uncomfortable and salty way , pounding and punishing herself and us . But she could take it , and what did we care ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Isle of Skye . It was the famous Skye Week in Skye , the last week in May , and we would soon be in . Quarter of an inch , indeed ! It took us three hours , spray in the face , spray in the ears , salt in the eyes . North About by Scottish Shores We were bound on the most wonderful cruise offering anywhere in the northern European world ? Clyde to Clyde north about , around beautiful old Scotland by her lochs and her canals and her glorious isles ( map , pages 496-7 ) . Our ship was a chartered Dutchman , a stout , seaworthy , and comfortable vessel with a strong diesel down below and sails enough to drive her along very nicely with anything like a favorable wind . She had been a fisherman in the North Sea once , but now she had three good cabins and a nice saloon below , a reasonable galley ? even a bath . She was the ideal means of seeing Scotland from the sea . With her , we could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our own accommodation when we got there .  |p495  Both Nance and I had seen something of Scotland in the war . We were married at Fort William . Our first son was born in Glasgow . Now we could revisit old haunts , and please ourselves ? we could go anywhere . We had found our Dutch Cristoden in North Wales and sailed up to Clydeside earlier in the year . Our crew were Mayflower veterans Ike Marsh and Graham Nunn ? Ike who 'd been boatswain of the 17th-century copy and was now 60 years old , and Graham Nunn , aged 19 , who had been the choice , of British Boys ' Clubs as one of the two ship 's boys. * From time to time we called in other  |p498  good mariners to assist , for , though small enough by big-ship standards , the broadbeamed Dutch butter handled best with a crew of four or five . Bob Sisson , staff photographer of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , met us in the Clyde . Godfrey Wicksteed , ex-mate of the Mayflower and an old hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared from his duties at a teachers training college in Leeds . For the rest , the crew were our family ? Christopher , aged 16 , Katherine , 14 , and Peter , 11 . They could come only in vacations from their schools . Burnt Islands Burn No More With such a crew in such a ship , our passage was a happy romp ? from off Helensburgh in the Firth of Clyde , past Holy Loch with its laid-up merchant ships ( where someday Polaris-missile submarines may moor ) , past picturesque spots with names like Dunoon and Innellan and Rothesay , and on up the Kyles of Bute to the narrows there by the Burnt Islands , where there was said to be a vitrified fort . What is a " vitrified fort " ? I did n't know . Who burned the Burnt Islands ? And what , for that matter , are " kyles , " and what is " Bute " ? We sought answers to all such questions , and had the time to find them . Kyles , it seems , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for the Burnt Isles and their fort , we landed by dinghy and found nothing there ? no slightest trace of any fort , only rough rocks at the sea 's edge and the low land covered with soft and springy long grass , very wet , with sea gulls ' nests everywhere and the disturbed gulls shrieking over us . Vitrified forts , we found , are for archeologists with patience and tools to dig for them , and the islets had last been burned some centuries before -- in 1685 , to be precise , when the Earl of Argyll 's garrison blew up the place , alarmed at the near approach of some ships of King James . We anchored for a night in Loch Riddon.  |p499  a quietly beautiful arm of the sea stretching northward from the kyles , one among many of the pleasant and protected sea lochs which make cruising in Scotland 's waters so interesting . Then we sailed on down the western strait , and later put the anchor down off a ruined small castle near Lochranza , on the Island of Arran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are so many good places in these sheltered straits and long sea arms called lochs . ( A lake is also a loch , and so is a bay sometimes . ) If the wind blowing  |p500  freshly in makes one anchorage untenable , there is always somewhere else to go for shelter ? so long as you can see . Mists and rain can be blinding and stay that way for weeks , even when the calendar has arrived at the period known officially as summer . We were lucky . It rained , of course , but it was often the soft and gentle rain , so common in those Scottish lochs , that touches the water with swift , soft circles and is so light the brief perfection of these circles is its only evidence , for it can not be felt on face or hair . A night 's rest at Lochranza , and so on again we sped toward the north , sailing with a favoring wind and the big hotter gliding silently and upright , quiet as a Boeing 707 in the stratosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Western Islands . But first we went up Loch Fyne ( famous for its herring once ) as far as Inveraray , and then back to pretty Ardrishaig for passage of the Crinan Canal . That nine-mile stretch of climbing and descending waters , some 30 feet wide and 10 deep , shifts small vessels by 15 locks from the waters of Loch Fyne to Loch Crinan on the Sound of Jura . It takes four hours , if they hustle . We did n't . Charging Lock Gates Full Tilt A special type of little coaster called a " puffer " has been developed for these canals of Scotland . Its upright boiler puffs like a noisy , panting dog . We sailed past one at Ardrishaig , a wall-sided , bargelike little thing with engine , boiler , and bridge jammed into minimal space at one end , mast and winch at the other , and the cargo hold taking up maximum space between ( page 508 ) . The puffer puffed past , flat out at five knots , bound light toward the Clyde . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff was a new kind of navigation to me ( pages 494 and 498 ) . I find that the water spilling out sets up a current which I must use full power to stem , despite my caution , and charge at the fragile lock gates with alarming speed . No worries , though : The Dutchman is in part designed for such canals . She handles beautifully and brings up short , inches from the waterfall over the lock gates . I quickly accept the offer of the services of an old lock man , Alec McCallum , aged 70 , to help us through . We use a sunny day very pleasantly charging through the canal , climbing up one set of locks and down another , pushing open heavy wooden lock gates , opening and closing sluices . charging at steel bridges which always open in time but sometimes just , being swung laboriously by hand at the last moment .  |p501  Everywhere the scene is marvelous ? away to the north the jagged mountains of the Highlands , and in the west the sea and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queer round hill where Scotland 's early kings were crowned , says Alec McCallum , the lock keeper . Here and there are the ruins of castles , blending perfectly with the wild background , mellowed clusters of harsh old rock crowning strategic hills . We smelled the bottom more than once and sheered very close to the banks all too frequently . But we passed out of the sea loch bound into the Sound of Jura and by the Gulf of Corryvreckan toward Iona with the unanimous reflection that if this was Scots canal cruising , we were for it . Our next stop was the fabled isle of Iona with its restored Abbey Church and tombs of ancient Scottish kings ( pages 502-3 ) . Macbeth and Duncan , Scotsmen say , lie there beneath moss-grown effigies in stone . The KODACHROME ? NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY whirlpools of Corryvreckan are quiet as we sail past , and the mountains of Mull are a blue and beautiful wonderland to the north . At Iona the work of restoration on the abbey is all but completed . We found technicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . Visitors flocked there by excursion steamer ( above ) , and many pilgrims came , for this lovely small island ? it is only a few square miles ? saw the birth of Christianity in western Scotland . Few Crofters Still Farm Rocky Coll From minute , fascinating Iona , we could see the islands of Tiree and Coll . That learned but pessimistic work published by the Admiralty called the West Coast of Scotland Pilot advised that anchorage off Arinagour at Coll should not be attempted without " local knowledge . " We had no local knowledge for any of these islands , beyond what we acquired as we went along .  |p502  " Do n't go in , " said Nance , cautious as always . " I 've got the Clyde Cruising Club sketch plans , " I said , referring to a folio of excellent small charts acquired in Glasgow . " We draw less than six feet . It 's clear , and the sun 's behind us . Here we go ! " Coll was the sort of place we liked , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite its loss of population in recent years and the decline of its fishing and its agriculture . It is low and small and off the beaten track . Here we met a cheerful Scot , hospitable as all his kind , named Guy Jardine , who kept the local pub , ran a croft , and owned one of the very few vehicles on the island . Mr. Jardine had been a rancher in central Africa for 30 years and retired to Coll to settle down . We gathered from him that Coll 's population was down to 150 souls , and that the island 's two castles , one old and the other new , were alike abandoned .  |p504  We visited these castles with our new friend and his little red truck , driving over rough roads and rougher fields . We bumped along to a wide , gently shelving beach where the cattle stood at the water 's edge . ( To them , it was a warm day . ) Facing the bay-loch here were the two castles , the one a medieval stronghold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly out of place ( right ) . The last laird to live there died in 1939 , we were told ; his heirs , faced with colossal upkeep costs , simply shut up the castle . " Some of the library is still there , and a bit of furniture , " said our guide . " It 's all just going to ruin . " Gold Seekers Undermine Old Walls We visited the so-called " white house , " where Dr. Johnson and the note-taking Boswell once had stayed . It was a black and roofless ruin , its walls split to the foundations ( below ) . A local story tells of gold having once been cached there , and seekers after the treasure , digging with more energy than care , had undermined everything . We called upon an islander , a quiet old man 504  |p506  known as Soldier , whose last soldiering had been in the Boer War . Soldier , aged 80 or thereabouts , sat at his peat fire with Morag , his cheerful wife of like age , while we yarned awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frisky-tailed and energetic , to grab a quick meal from their mothers . Ducks quacked , hens clucked , and the little burn bubbled endlessly over its numerous rocks . The thatched roof was held down by a string of large stones garlanded round it , pendent from an arrangement of wire netting like a woman 's hair net . " Have n't been in town for fifteen years , " chuckled old Soldier , meaning Arinagour ( two churches , one street , two stores ) . " That he has n't , " smiled Morag . " This will do for us ! " The big kettle sang upon the hob , and the neat little cottage reeked with the pleasant smoke of slow-  |p507  burning peat . We liked Coll , with its lonely beaches , its almost Mediterranean sea and sky , its peaceful solitude . " But do n't come back in a winter gale ! " was the parting advice of Mr. Jardine . We had heard of the islanders of Tiree , Coll 's nearest neighbor , whose gait is supposedly recognizable anywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often fighting to stay upright against the wild westerly gales . But no wild westerly blew as we sailed quietly on toward Skye on a lovely May morning . We sailed at 3 a.m. , already light in those high latitudes , and wandered northward . All the Inner and many of the Outer Hebrides shone peacefully upon the tranquil sea , and the mountains of Mull and Lorne stood gloriously to the eastward . With a nice favoring breeze we made six knots , and the sea sang softly beneath the broad blue bows . Into the Sound of Sleat we came sailing , and on through the Kyle of Lochalsh . Steering was so arduous , for the moment , there was scarce time to admire the wonder of our surroundings ? upon the one hand , southern Skye , hill upon hill , rolling away toward the 3,000-foot Cuillins ; upon the other , half the Highlands of Scotland , with the blue arms of mountain-sided lochs stretching deep into the beautiful valleys , where sunshine and shadow painted wondrous patterns . For a while the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet and jumping pound of it , staggering along the uncomfortable , ancient , salty way until we reached some shelter . I wondered how the Vikings had managed with their vessels in these waters . They had ruled here for centuries , dominating all these islands , and their burial places are still to be seen back among the hills . Pipes Skirl a Welcome to Skye And so we came to Portree , principal and best-sheltered haven in Skye , and anchored near the pier . A water carnival was in progress as part of Skye Week , and a fast outboard towing a shivering water-ski expert set up a jumping wash as it crisscrossed the harbor . Banners flew everywhere . Bagpipes skirled romantically . Welcome to Skye !  |p509  Skye is the second largest island in Scotland , measuring some 50 miles from north to south and as much as 25 miles across . We had come primarily to attend the famous MacLeod Day at Dunvegan Castle ; so , hiring a car , we hurried off toward Loch Dunvegan . The coastal road climbed mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow way through scenery of stirring beauty . The sun shone and the peat cutters were about . Once we passed a family doing its wash at a mountain stream . They had set up a large copper , such as whalemen used to use , to boil sheets . The stream rinsed and the keen , clear air dried the washed clothes , spread out upon the heather and the grass . Against a background of distant mountain and near-by loch , Dunvegan Castle stands solid , dominating , upon a sheer wall of rock . A castle has stood at that spot for more than a thousand years , and this stronghold of the Clan MacLeod has been lived in by the same family for at least 700 of them . From the battlements the wild music of the Scottish pipes had roused the countryside to arms , to victory , to rejoicings or lamentations . Now the music of the pipes floated down again , welcoming the returning MacLeods to the ancient headquarters of their clan . MacLeods streamed past us , the manner of their garb proclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand ( next page ) .  |p512  The chief of Clan MacLeod stood smiling on the parapet before the castle . Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod . aged over 80. is a Dame of the Order of the British Empire and 28th chief of MacLeod . Her world travels helped to make this MacLeod Day such an international occasion . Clan Gathers From Around the World " We hold MacLeod Day so we can all get to know each other better , " said Dame Flora , taking a moment off from welcoming the hundreds of guests and visitors . It is a grand opportunity for MacLeods from all over the world to exchange greetings . " The clan spirit is strong and growing even stronger , though the real significance of the clan system has been gone from Scotland since the failure of Bonnie Prince Charlie to restore the Stuarts to the throne of Britain in 1745-46 . After that hopeless rising of the clans against the Hanoverians of England . the wearing of the kilt and the carrying of weapons were alike prohibited . It was the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clansmen and the substitution of sheep ? when shipload after shipload of Highlanders sailed for the United States , for Nova Scotia ( where descendants still speak the Gaelic and wear the kilt on occasion ) , for Australia and New Zealand .  |p513  We went to a place called Boreraig at the Atlantic end of Loch Dunvegan , where the MacCrimmons , historic pipers to the chiefs MacLeod , for 300 years held a famous pipg college . Dame Flora made the journey m her castle by boat , with a piper deafenall hands in the bows , a wild and moving sound somehow right for those parts . The finer points of all this piping were explained to us by Seton Gordon , well-known Highland naturalist and writer and himself a noted judge of the bagpipes ( page 510 ) . We found Seton , like other thoughtful Highlanders , much concerned with the problem of depopulation . Skye 's permanent population , he said , was three thousand down since the last census of more than eight thousand . For many young people can not find employment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a complete answer . What the Highlands and islands need are people ? permanent residents . " They are closing our Boreraig school for the lack of children to attend it , " said a local lady , somewhat sorrowfully , but added brightly that a baby was born there last week ! They need more than one baby to get that school to open again . North to the Outer Hebrides It had been my plan to sail around Skye and among the small islands , and then to make for Oban and Loch Linnhe and so into the Caledonian Canal . That way would bring us to Loch Ness where we had , I hoped , a date with the famous monster reputed to live there . But now here we were on Skye , and the wind set in southwest , with forecast of fresh westerlies to follow . Why not sail over the Minch to the romantic Isle of Lewis , and roam for a while among the Outer Hebrides ( map , page 496 ) . So we used that favoring wind and sailed forthwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northbound from Skye toward the Isle of Lewis . The Vikings had sailed this way . The Picts and Scots had sailed here in flimsy craft , and the Irish in their curraghs . Where they could go , Old Hands , Their Average Age 68 , Man a Drifter in the Minch Drifters earned their name by shutting off power and gliding with the current over herring grounds . They trail milelong nets . Radium was built in 1904. when that element 's discovery was still news . The author , who met her crew at Stornoway . fished with them for a night . Recently Radium was sold to a navigation school in Aberdeen to teach recruits . " We are all finished with the sea , " says her owner . William James Campbell , " and our lifelong time at the fishing . " Fresh winds . racing tides , and uneven bottom make sailing hazardous in the Minch. a tricky strait between Scotland and the Outer Hebrides .  |p514  surely also could we , with a well-found and able vessel . Our destination was Stornoway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibility was poor . A thousand sea gulls , all fat and sleek , circled to meet us . In the harbor at the head of the inlet we could see all sorts of fishing vessels . Radium Nightly Nets Herring At Stornoway we met a wonderful old fishing ship called the Radium , from Findochty on the Moray Firth . The Radium looked a hundred years old , and her crew was a remarkable group of old boys , every one of them a pensioner . We berthed near this vessel and became friendly with the crew , whose average age was 68 , and the youngest 65 . There was a lot of very bad weather while we were at Stornoway , but always the little old Radium made her nightly runs to sea to fish the wild Minch and bring back herring . She was a drifter , I learned , a fisherman 78 feet long that caught fish by the simple means of paying out a mile or so of nets and then lying to the lee end of them , drifting , while the shoals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in when dawn came . It seemed simple , but the trick was to put the net out where the fish were .  |p516  I made a trip out with the old boys . " Our ship was built in ' 04 , " owner William James Campbell told me . " She was a sailing ship first , what we call a wherry . But we put an engine into her in 1910 . Have to keep up with the times , you know . Ca n't call a ship the Radium and not be modern . " Campbell had been with her for 52 of her 55 years , and had owned her since 1914 . But he did n't skipper her . He left that to young John Smith . aged 67 , who had been in the ship only 30 years . Old-timers Fish Without Gadgets We sailed early one evening , going out quietly to sea as the day fishermen were coming in . We went well out in the Minch . I was invited into the wheelhouse and squeezed myself in , with some difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather elderly compass swinging above the helmsman 's head , and the smallest possible hatchway that led down to the dark depths where the ancient engine was noisily at work . Abaft that , in the pointed gem , was a bit of a cabin with some shelves for bunks , a small cooking stove , a table and two benches , and little else . On deck a large lifeboat was stowed aft . It had a look of some permanency , as if it was not moved very often . There was one small mast carrying a bit of a gaff-and-boom mizzen. to which the ship would lie through the night while the nets were out . I looked in vain for modern instruments . " Got none , " said Campbell . " Do n't hold with all these gadgets . " Skipper Smith explained that they went out on bearings . When certain hills and headlands bore in certain directions , and the weather was right and the state of the moon and tide ,  |p517  and all that sort of natural thing , why they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as anywhere else , and shot their nets in a businesslike and orderly manner . That was that . There were several other drifters , very much more modern , hurrying here and there , and we could listen to them chattering on their radios while their electronic fish loops and so forth pinged and the screens gave off dashes of blue light , and showed no fish whatever . I noticed that all these modern fellows fetched up close by the Radium and shot their nets there , as near as they could to the same ground . Our 55 nets , each 60 yards long and about 20 feet deep , were all carried in the hold . The work of getting the long line of nets joined ap and properly into the water went on for quite a while , but that crew of old men worked as a splendid team ( page 512 ) . Heavy work bothered them not at all , nor did the motion of the vessel , nor the fact that her bulwarks were only about a foot high . A slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little chance in the sea . But they did not slip . None ever had . " We work here with the Lord , " said another Campbell , a septuagenarian with a son master in a liner , and he smiled toward the heaving Minch as if he were a man who knew peace . Tea to Sterilize the Tonsils Toward midnight , when the nets were all out the way that they should be and the little vessel lay more or less quietly under her smoky rag of a mizzen , the old boys trooped down below . Two kept the deck , one in the  |p518  wheelhouse ( whence controls of what looked like old bicycle chain led down to the engine ) , and one on deck . The others gathered round the little cabin table and helped themselves to crackers and large hunks of cheese , the lot washed down with plenty of extremely strongtea ? the sort of tea that sterilizes the tonsils and leaves dark tannic stains on pots and mugs . They quaffed it like water . At the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 My Soul , and Forget Not All His Benefits . " It looked as if it had been up there since 1904 , beneath a rack of smoke-stained and very elderly charts , and I learned that indeed it had . For an hour or two , old gray heads nodded around the table , and strong tobacco fumes won a battle with the fuggy air . There was plenty of fresh air outside for those who wanted it . They gave me an hour or so in one of the shelflike bunks ? cupboard would be a better word . The headroom was all of 15 inches , and the bunkboards were not 22 inches wide . To raise one 's head was to bang a beam , and the timbers of the Radium were hard . At dawn we hauled . It was dawning by 3 a.m. , and the hauling of those joined-up nets went on for hours ? hours and hours and hours . It was soon evident that there were few fish . Here and there a herring flapped feebly , but there were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacefully to her nets while the capstan groaned and the long rope was hove in around it , bringing the nets . I helped a little . It was tough , cold work . " You know , " said William James Campbell to me , paying no attention to the paucity of fish , " there 's many a one sleeping ashore just now has never seen the wonder of the sunrise . We 're fortunate men , we are . " " Fortunate ? What about no fish ? " I asked . " That 's fishing , " said he . " Always hoping . A couple of boxes tonight , and fifty last night . As for that , if there 's not good fishing in this Minch , there 's none on this side of Scotland , anywhere . We take it as it comes . " Nobody got on fish that night . The herring just were n't there . I was tired as a hunting dog when I got back , but the wonderful old boys were as fresh as larks . They cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing into their bunks , and they would be away again in the early evening ? five nights a week , but never Sundays . Causeway Links the Outer Hebrides On the island of North Uist we met engineers busily joining two islands of the Outer Hebrides into one , at least to the extent of connecting them by causeway . Such a connection had been made between South  |p519  Uist and Benbecula early in the second World War . Now another was almost ready to carry traffic from North Uist to the other end of Benbecula , thus joining these three islands. * Engineer MacDonald , of Inverness , told us the new causeway would be open soon . You could ford across at low tide now , walking or with a Jeep . North Uist was an attractive island , much of it carpeted with little wild flowers , golden or white . It was for sale , the whole 70,000 acres of it , lochs and all , with its fishing , deer coverts , and everything . You had to buy the whole island . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to anchor in or off Loch Uskavagh on Benbecula for an hour or so to launch *Isobel Wylie Hutchison wrote of roaming " From Barra to Butt in the Hebrides " in the October , 1954 , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC . Nance in her folding canoe , so that she could sail over to Skye in the track of Flora MacDonald . Here that young heroine had rowed Prince Charlie to a hiding place on Skye , tradition said , with the redcoats hotfoot after him . But more reliable history books said she recruited five stout Highlanders to do the rowing , and dressed the prince as her maid . As we approached the loch , the wind got up and the sea looked gray and horribly cold . Flora might have been grateful for the fog , but Nance was n't . Anyway , she was cooking the dinner . So , with a doff of the sou'wester to brave Flora and her Highlanders , we sailed on to Loch Boisdale , to anchor off yet another place where Prince Charlie had hidden ( page 515 ) . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the prince had been a hunted fugitive for many months . He must  |p520  have slept in almost as many spots as George Washington , but he slept a lot rougher . As we anchored off Calvay Castle , a wobbly rocket scarred the Hebridean sky , for South Uist has been developed into a rocket range . We saw this range distantly and were pleased to notice that it also grazed some cows . The cows are driven off when a rocket is fired . American Macneil Rebuilds a Castle At Castlebay on Barra we met The Macneil , Macneil of Barra , chief of the clan , to find him an unusual chief indeed . Robert Macneil of Barra is a Michigan-born American , a former architect practicing in Washington and New York . Now , with his wife Elizabeth , he has a summer home at Kisimul Castle at Barra and a winter home in Vermont . Officially recognized in 1915 as hereditary chief of his clan , The Macneil acquired the estates more than 20 years ago . Seagirt on all sides , set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the old home of his ancestors appealed to the American . Its restoration would involve a real rebuilding , for the castle was a ruin and many of its stones had been carried off years before for ballast in local fishing smacks . But Kisimul had long been the stronghold of the Macneils of Barra , though the family had moved to a more convenient home ashore in 1759 and had lost their estates less than a century later . The present chief bought the castle in 1937 . Under the guidance ' of the Ancient Monuments Board , he began its restoration the same year . The British Govern-  |p521  ment gave its stamp of approval by an award of 9,000 pounds . By June of 1959 the work had so far advanced that The Macneil and his wife could move in . His flag was raised , and it blew proudly in the breeze as we landed by the ancient gates ( pages 516-7 ) . The Macneil himself , kilted and bonneted , welcomed us . His castle is a splendid example of the stronghold type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five-story tower , rapidly approaching the state it was in two centuries ago . Not even a freshly painted sign indicating a telephone-cable crossing could give it a modern look . Barra is a fascinating island , with its beach of cockleshells that is its airport at low tide . We had been told of this unique airport where the manageress put up a wind sock on a broom handle to guide the airplanes in . But we found that Katherine Macpherson had been provided with a permanent wind  |p522  sock , though she still had to test the surface of the beach with her fire truck half an hour before her airplane landed . At Barra , too , we attended a local ceilidh , pronounced " cayley. " a social gathering where the islanders follow one another singing songs and giving recitations in Gaelic . It was a grand show in the village hall . Children and women sang strange songs . handed down through generations . Calum Johnston played the pipes and played them bravely , and Father MacMasters ( I remembered him from my naval days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a TV antenna in all Barra , and there was no electric power , either . Here were people who could amuse themselves in their own ways , by their own efforts .  |p524  We sailed by Mingulay and headed eastward to look at the Small Isles ? Canna , Rhum , Eigg , and Muck , none very large but all very mountainous . In good visibility you can see them all at once . At Canna we spent the Fourth of July with John Lorne Campbell , the laird . and Margaret Shaw Campbell . his American wife . The harbor was beautiful but almost deserted . The one local school had long been closed for the lack of children to attend it . Ponies and Deer Roam Rhum From Canna it is an hour or two 's sail to the island curiously called Rhum , or Rum , where little birds flit along the bushes and come asking for crumbs , utterly fearless , and a thousand red deer run loose on the hills . We made a trip across a rough road to the far side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly in the hills . The entire island , privately owned until 1957 , now is maintained by Britain 's Nature Conservancy as a wildlife reserve . Rhum 'S population once was 400 , but these departed in the 1820 's : today the island has a bare two dozen inhabitants . I could not get into Eigg . The anchorage there is badly exposed in southwesterly winds , and I dared not go lest we be driven ashore . So I beat past the Point of Ardnamurchan and into the Sound of Mull to call at Tobermory . Here were Highland Games in progress on part of the golf course outside the picturesque town . A band of pipers from the Glasgow police force came to pipe for the games , and lusty Highlanders and islanders flung ham-  |p525  mers , tossed small telegraph poles called cabers , blew pipes , ran races , threw halfhundredweights of iron over crossbars ten feet high , and generally had a wonderful time ( pages 522-3 ) . These cabers are the whole trunks of young trees , trimmed roughly , about twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found I could just about lift one end . It took Ike , Graham , and myself to lift the whole thing . Toss it ? It would be simpler to toss a steer . " It 's all in the balance , laddie , " said a whiskered onlooker . At Tobermory lie the remains of a galleon of the Spanish Armada . There have been many searches made for it , all unsuccessful . I noticed when we anchored that  |p526  the soundings were a couple of fathoms deeper than the chart showed . " They dredged the top ten feet away looking for that galleon last summer , " Mr. Alexander Allan told me , " and they found nothing conclusive . " Graham went down in his skin-diving outfit to look . He found only dark water and mud . In Mr. Allan 's family were some Spanish coins , brought up locally  |p527  from an old ship . He showed them to us , but I saw no glint of gold in them . Mull is a glorious place , beautiful in its own right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lochs ? places like Loch Sunart and Loch Aline , across the Sound of Mull ? and a dozen more lovely lochs of its own . Here and there among the trees and hills were the shells of abandoned castles , and many a headland down the sound carried its grim ruins from the " good old days , " when every laird and chieftain , and householder , too , had to fight for what he had ? light , and fight hard . We sailed past these places , and I thought of wartime days when so many Atlan voys had passed this way . Nance v tioned at Oban then with a branch Royal Air Force known as Coastal Co Now she wanted to have a look at Obx ( page 508 ) , so we anchored off a where once the flying boats had been out for maintenance . Now it was all a junk heap , a piece of war jetsam tha as if it had been bombed . Our anchor up some wartime wreckage .

To leeward of us , as we sailed on north into the almost landbound upper loch , Ben Nevis , highest mountain in Britain , raised its great gaunt head , for once in clear and rainless sight . Here we came on in a welter of foam through the Corran Narrows , where the tide raced and the surface waters showed their torment over the foul rocks too close below . Tide rip met tide rip , all down the dark loch , and not for the first time in these waters tried to take our stout Cristoden for a plaything and hurl her around . Sometimes Nance and Ike had difficulty holding her on course . This was the way to Glen Mor and the Caledonian Canal , that rift right through the heart of the Highlands . A geologic fault and series of long lochs helped man to cut a way through for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Great Glen " near Fort William , we were in the canal . It was a splendid cruising ground , and we stayed there two weeks . The Caledonian is a gentleman 's canal , big enough to take ships 160 feet long . Its canal links Loch Linnhe and the Moray Firth with the three narrow inland lochs of Lochy , Oich , and Ness . No stretch lies much higher than 100 feet above the sea . James Watt first surveyed it in 1773 . Thomas Telford built it between 1804 and 1822 . About a mile from the canal 's entrance , a set of eight locks raises ships some seventy feet quickly ? a real stairway of locks called Neptune 's Staircase . Cattle Graze in the Great Glen As we mounted lock after lock , taking all morning in the leisurely process ( for everything was done by hand ) , we were treated to glorious views ? old Inverlochy Castle by the River Lochy , Ben Nevis and all its associate hills ( page 525 ) , and new Inverlochy Castle , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobbs is an unusual Highlander . Born in England , he spent much of his life in western Canada , and now near his seventieth year , he has organized a cattle ranch in the Great Glen , where much of the land had gone almost to ruin with bracken and lack of care . It takes courage and considerable capital to restore such land , and Mr. Hobbs had been on the job for more than ten years . Lush green fields in which the sleek cattle ran , large cattle shelters , well-fenced and well-cared-for pasturage in all directions were evidence of his good work . We found him full of plans for the further development of the Great Glen . A good road now passes up the glen , often close to the canal . We saw a constant stream of cars , many hauling trailers , and there were t numerous caravan camps in farmers ' fields . Instead of warring Highlanders , now there were holidaymakers everywhere . Lair of the Loch Ness Monster Since Loch Ness lay on our route , I was resolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever might be found in those deep and very dark waters . We found Loch Ness a remarkable loch , deep ( more than 700 feet ) , 20 miles long , a freshwater-filled crack in the mountains , and we stayed there many days . Sometimes the weather was clear and the loch mirrored its noble rim of protecting hills ; more often rain or mist or wind made it easy to believe in monsters human or marine , for the dark heaviness of the Highland mountains then weighs upon the spirit , and black waters of the windtossed loch might hide anything . " It is a fey place , " Nance said . So I sailed the loch up and down , and across and across again , skirting the steep-to sides . I concentrated on the waters off Drumnadrochit , where the monster ? or something ? had been most frequently reported . On a point here were the well-preserved ruins of Urquhart Castle , once a great stronghold of the Clan Grant . Loch Ness is more than 100 feet deep close beside the castle walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fair haven for any monster . A busload of tourists had reported sight of the monster very recently . Where was he now ? I cruised and beat about the loch exhaustively , closing the headlands by Castle Urquhart as near to as I dared ( page 526 ) . Once we saw a long patch of curiously rippling black water , some upsurge from the rocky depths so far below . At a quick glance it might have been the wake of something large and bulky and long , swimming near the surface . I sailed over to this curious patch of rippling water , to find it nothing but thatI stayed there awhile , hove to . No monster . The wakelike patch gradually disappeared and did not form again . ( Continued on page 535 )  |p535  On another day the appearance of some-hing odd proved , on sailing over , to be five . rds , alighted in line upon the water . When e eye strains in so eerie and romantic a place , is easy to see significance in anything . By night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside a crumbling jetty there which once had been used for pleasure steamers but now fell apart at the touch . Near-by residents believed in the monster . " I saw him the other day , " Mrs. J. A. Menzies told us in the parlor of her pleasant green timbered home . " He 's nothing new . My grandfather saw him too . Only the national publicity and all the fuss are new . They started in 1933 , and we could do without them . " He was " like a big eel , " she said , and he showed himself close under the castle , just across the bay from her house . Mrs. Menzies was a quiet Scotswoman and , like her kind , not given to idle rumor . And she was far from alone in her firm belief in the monster . " There is something here , " she said , " something in the loch , very odd indeed . "  |p538  This certainly seemed the general view locally , and also in Inverness . After Mrs. Menzies ' report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay and its adjacent waters . I had a lookout posted also ashore in the high keep of the castle , for you could see well from there . The summer wind blew softly all that day , and now and then the sun shone briefly through the clouds , touching the heather-clad hills to a warm loveliness of soft purple and quiet browns . But still we could find no sign of any monster . Then suddenly , close in beside the castle where the chart showed 80 feet , we struck something ! The centerboard grated , as it slipped over ? not a grating as on rocks , but a gentler , softer noise . The ship shivered slightly , held in her stride a moment . Something was there , where nothing could be ! We were very close in . But we 'd been there before on a dozen cross-loch runs , and the water was deep . What was this now ? Mate Wicksteed was over the side in a moment . We fell off a little from the land to be on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . It seemed undamaged . We let it swiftly down again . Wicksteed swam our length below , coming up quickly for breath and going down again and again . There was no sign of anything ? no monster , no whale , no rock . We tacked , and sailed again over the place . This time we touched nothing . We saw nothing , either . No irate monster , his back dented by a steel center plate , broke the surface to glare at us or perhaps to rush upon us . What had we touched ? There was a depth of 80 feet just there . We will never know . Does a Monster Really Exist ? Yet there are blurred photographs of some odd beast disporting himself in Loch Ness waters . At Inverness , when we were passing through the last Caledonian Canal locks on our way to the sea , we met Mrs. Constance Whyte , 11M.B. , B.S. , who has made an objective study of the evidence for the monster . Mrs. Whyte is wife of the manager of the canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , with more than the usual facilities for studying the district and its records . In a book which she titled More Than a Legend , * she has assembled quite a convincing *Published by Hamish Hamilton , London , 1957.  |p539  case . Here the few authentic photographs ( not very clear ) are printed , and the local evidence is marshaled and sifted . Mrs. Whyte has dealt with nothing but fact , and her book is a sober work , quietly written and impressive . Both Mr. and Mrs. Whyte , like many other intelligent citizens , believe that some strange denizen of the deep lives in Loch Ness . " Reports of a monster of some sort , his wake seen when swimming , his splash when writhing on the surface , and the fantastic way he sinks vertically , are too persistent for the whole thing to be a concoction or a feat of the imagination , " said Mrs. Whyte . " These reports are n't from sensation seekers but from local people , who often mention them with considerable reluctance . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ness monster , and what it is . Meantime we are left wondering just what our centerboard did touch in the deep and mysterious waters off Castle Urquhart . Where Scottish Boys Learn Sea Skills From Inverness , pleasant Paris of the north , " capital of the Highlands " as that fair city is often called , we sailed along that great bulge of Scotland which includes the shires of Nairn , Moray , Banff , and Aberdeen . This is the North Sea side of Scotland , and the 60 miles of the Caledonian Canal had shortened our route there by hundreds of miles . Moray Firth is studded with ports small and large , once considerable trading centers but now mainly used for fishing , and we visited all we could . At Burghead , where the Outward Bound Trust runs a Scots sea school , we spent an absorbing couple of days and went inland a way to see the famous school of Gordonstoun , where Wicksteed had once been science and sailing master , with Prince Philip among the pupils . At Lossiemouth near by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air with Navy jets . By Buckle , Cullen , Banff . Macduff we sped ? all fishing towns , romantic , colorful , full of interest . I wished that I could spend days in each . but we were bound south toward Edinburgh and festival time , and had no days to spare . Aberdeen , city of granite and great shipyards , proved a surprise with its beaches , outdoor dancing , and indoor swimming pool , the best in Britain . Here we searched for the berth where the Thermopylae was built almost a hundred years ago , most glorious of the  |p540  sleek Scottish clippers . But the shipyard now was covered with ways for huge steel liners . tankers , ore carriers , and the like , and no one remembered exactly where the clipper ways had been . Aberdeen is a great fishing port too : the Fish docks there were a busy sight any morning ( page 52S ) .

" Best fishing port in Britain , captain ! " yelled a smiling Aberdonian in my ear . Anyone May Golf at St. Andrews At St. Andrews ( where we traveled in a fast new diesel train from Dundee ) , our seagoing children admired the donkeys and minute ponies on the beach beyond the Royal and Ancient Golf Club , while large men swung industriously at small white balls ( page 532 ) . " Aye , anyone may play here , " said an elderly official in a shelter in front of the clubhouse , " but you 've got to book . " I had n't booked , could n't play anyway . There was a putting green close by , not part of the holy course , and here the children tried out their lack of skill among kilted little boys and girls whose prowess was astonishing . Then Edinburgh , in festival time ! Pageantry , massed bands , the best massed pipers in the world and the best military tattoo , theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions of art , the famous Murrayfield Highland Games ? all this , and Edinburgh 's unique charm , warm hospitality , and wonderful hinterland too : what a prospect ! We attended the games , saw the tattoo three times , watched a hundred pipers march stirringly along Princes Street , attended unusual Scots theater where splendid companies performed medieval and modern plays , sometimes on a stage placed amid the very audience ( pages 536-7 ) . We saw the ballet , masterpieces of Czech art , the Abraham Lincoln exhibition , international film shows . We rubbed shoulders with people from the ends of the earth , all gathered together for the famed International Festival , and were glad , at the end of each long , busy day , of the haven of our ship in the port of Granton near by . Edinburgh at any time is a splendid city . At festival time , toward summer 's end , it is unique . Sec " Playing 3,000 Golf Courses in Fourteen Lands , " by Ralph A.

It was silted up in part , friends said and largely neglected . " Forty miles , forty locks , and forty bridges : said the pessimists , " and you 'll probably hay , to work half of them yourselves , if not the lot . You 'll be lucky to get through . " In fact this last canal was a pleasure . Itook two busy days ? long days of openinc and closing lock gates and bridges , swingin round sharp corners , dodging obstruction ,  |p541  king the early autumn leaves off trees . In e stretches the water was a bit noisome , but there were lovely stretches of countryside where farmers were harvesting , and we passed some pretty towns .

The log said we had sailed two and a half thousand miles in twenty colorful weeks . We felt that now we really had seen something of wonderful Scotland . " That was a trip , that was !
