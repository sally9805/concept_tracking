Can Broadway 's biggest director renounce " Show Biz " for " Art " ? In his new post he will have every chance to do so ? with dizzying power to help rescue or bury the American theatre . FsLIAKAZAN , as director of the repertory company of New York 's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts , has been given a chance to do something important in the American theatre . As an actor and director , Kazan has survived thirty years in the jungle of show business . On Broadway since 1937 , he has directed two plays by Arthur Miller ( All My Sons and Death of a Salesman ) , four plays by Tennessee Williams ( A Streetcar Named Desire , Camino Real , Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , and Sweet Bird of Youth ) , and fifteen other plays and musical comedies . In addition , since 194-4 , Ile has directed sixteen movies , including On the Waterfront and Baby Doll . At the new Vivian Beaumont . Theatre opening in the Center in 1964 , he will command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a n d equal to the best in Europe . He will have nearly four times as much working space-1100 square feet of stage area ? as there is in any playhouse on Broadway , plus uniquely automated technical facilities . He will be able to rehearse plays for as many as thirty weeks , ten times the average Broadway rehearsal period . ( Kazan rehearsed the cast of J.B. a few years back ' for exactly nineteen goddamn days . " ) At the end of his fiscal year he wo n't be required to balance his considerable budget , let alone earn a profit for angels . If he shows a loss on ticket sales , the deficit will be made up by patrons such as Mrs. Vivian Beaumont Allen who gave $3 million toward construction of the theatre . Mostimportant , Kazan will have a choice of plays , players , and methods of production limited by his own aims and not much else . He must make certain decisions with Robert Whitehead , his codirector whose functions are largely administrative . He must also satisfy Laurance Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center . But these men are inclined now to defer to Kazan in artistic matters . " I'ns going to work for Lincoln Center , " Kazan says , " as long as I can do what I want to do . When 1 ca n't do that , I 'll quit . " So , for all practical purposes , he is quite free to create the repertory company in his own image . Along corrupt , commercial old Broadway , something has always been going wrong with the American theatre . Either audiences are becoming insensitive , critics more dastardly , unions more intransigent , performers more repetitious , playwrights soft on their earnings , or directors , producers , and property owners hungrier for a hit . Where Broadway people have gathered . one has eternally heard fanciful talk of an ideal theatre . Every profession , of course , has its dream ? in journalism it 's " let 's start a magazine " ? but in the theatre the dream has had singular intensity for the simple reason that so much has been wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been defined as a theatre where a group of players cocdd work continuously , free from box-office pressures , to put on the great plays of the past as well as the best new work being written . Beyond this , the dream theatre has always had some significant collective attitude toward the contemporary world which it would express through its art . The Provincetown Players , founded in 1915 , and the Group Theatre of the ' thirties were attempts in this direction , 67 but eventually they floundered without sufficient funds to support them . In Europe , the dream has been realized to varying degrees in state-subsidized theatres : France 's Theatre Nationale Populaire , Germany 's Berliner Ensemble , and England 's Old Vie ( soon to he part of a National Theatre ) . And since 1958 in America , plans for Lincoln Ccnter 's theatre have evolved precisely with a view to forming an ideal repertory company . Robert Whitehead considers the appointment of Kazan as evidence of the group 's vision : - We wanted a living theatre aimed at a more civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we felt Kazan would give us this . " RELAXED AS A LIVE WIRE N 0 T long ago , Kazan spent some days and evenings with inc talking about the Lincoln Center and other aspects of his career . He is a short , congenial , ambiguous man with unrulyto-wild black hair ( now graying ) , eyes too close , nose too much , and a taste in wearing apparel that ranges from wrinkled tweeds to sweat shirts . He complains that strangers often mistake him for a taxi driver . He has a sinewy quality and an intense way of expressing himself that often make him seem to be one of nature 's own forces . You suspect that he is aware of his own superintensity hut , at age fifty-two , is still a little in awe of it . His surface manner is informal , tending toward raffishness . The knot of his tie customarily hangs an inch or two below his collar button . Invariably , he is the first person in a room to remove his jacket , slip out of his shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokes big cigars . calls males as well as females baby , and swears just about all the time , using all the words in any company . All this gives a strong impression of aged-in-the-wood nonconformity . On the other hand , privately , he is extremely neat and well organized . Ten minutes after Kazan moves into a hotel room , his suitcase is emptied , his clothes are put away , and his toilet articles are regimented in the medicine chest . Even when he is not actively engaged in a production , his days are carefully ( and usually completely ) scheduled : recently , it was 8:30 to 9:30 A.M. at the psychiatrist 's , a full morning of appointments , a light lunch at his desk , and a four-hour stint on the script of his new film , America , America . Then , too , he meticulously collects the opening-night reviews , telegrams , letters , memos , souvenirs , and news clips that touch on his professional life and has them pasted into thick scrapbooks , now numbering eighteen volumes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to write a book . Kazan is aware that he is expected to create something new and significant in the theatre at Lincoln Center . He , no less than other show people , has shared the dream . " I am ready , " he says , " for work in something that is more the way I think the theatre should be . The theatre is a collective art and in the back of my heart I 've always hoped to have this kind of theatre . I believe people value good theatre . They recognize it and flock to it when it happens . " Having said ( in a public statement issued last year ) that he would never again direct a play on Broadway , he obviously feels that an extension of the Broadway stage at Lincoln Center would hardly be worth the effort . He passionately predicts that he will do better things at Lincoln Center than he has ever done before . He says he has been frustrated by " disgusting " commercialism on Broadway ( and in Hollywood , of course ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make something popular . " Now , he promises , he is going to get " the best actors , directors , and writers and make this a living art center for the theatre . . . We 're going to have about forty actors and actresses and they 'll have a chance to play many roles .... We 're not going to ask them to work for nothing , but for a living wage ? what a fine actor wants is to have pride in and respect for what he does and he 'll have that in the repertory company . " Kazan has many plans for the repertory , but few are operational now . One problem has been that the theatre itself has been delayed in construction . Another has been Kazan 's involvement with America , America , which he is filming this stammer in Greece and Turkey . Kazan and Whitehead have recently assembled a company of inexperienced players who will back up the professionals ; this fall , they are scheduled to begin acting classes . Kazan and Whitehead have also been looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays with the repertory company a year in advance of the opening at Lincoln Center . The professional actors themselves , however , have not been assembled . Conversations have been held with certain performers Thomas B. Morgan , who was formerly an editor of " Look " and of " Esquire , " has written scores of magazine articles , including many on the theatre . His film script on Albert Schweitzer won an Academy Award , and he has recently completed a novel . 68 ELIA KAZAN 'S EXPECTATIONS but none ( as I write ) have been signed to contracts . Some are expected to be " graduates " of Actors Studio , the Method acting school with which Kazan has been identified . Recently Kazan severed his official connection with the Studio . " I felt I could n't wear two hats , " he says . " Between the Center and the Studio , I would have been competing with myself . " About two weeks later the Studio abruptly announced that it was planning to produce plays starring Studio people . Kazan remains confident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants , but a decided coolness now exists between Kazan and the old bunch . Finally , he may not " want " many of them . Kazan has also been discussing plays with playwrights . Arthur Miller 's new play , Kazan says , may be the first offering , going into rehearsal about a year from now , At the same time , a " classic " play ( something Greek , a Shakespeare , or an Ibsen , perhaps ) will he rehearsed and will open a fcw days after the Miller play . Six or seven weeks later , the company will present a third work , either a new comedy by S. N. Behrman or a work by a " new " American writer . Presumably , essayist-novelist James Baldwin is working now on a play for Kazan . The first year 's repertory will be rounded out some ten weeks later by a Eugene O'Neill drama . During any given week , then , the company will be presenting two or three different plays . The first two will be Kazan productions ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Thereafter , Kazan will direct one or more a year as other directors are invited in to work with the company . Meanwhile , in a supplementary 299-scat auditorium , a different type of theatre will be presented at the Center . " Here our writers and directors will have an opportunity to try things that are far out , " Kazan says of the smaller theatre . " They will he given an opportunity to say what they must say about living here and now in America . It will be a place where they can have the right to fail ! " A RIGHT TO FAIL B U T surely saying what " must " be said and its corollary , the right to fail , must turn out to be part of the larger theatre 's essential purpose , too , or it can not amount to anything . At least for the present , however , Kazan apparently draws a distinction between criteria for the work to be done in the big 1,100-seat Vivian Beaumont Theatre , where his own directing efforts will be concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional , " the other " unconventional " plays . It is as though he would combine Broadway and off-Broadway under a single , but segregated , roof without remedying ! he defects of either . He seems to have thought much more about creating a theatre to which people " flock " than about what might or should he presented to them . For instance , long before he had read Arthur Miller 's play or had any idea what it was about , he had made up his mind that he wanted it for the repertory company 's opening show . Also , he has signed up a play by S. N. Behrman , who seems a strange choice , given the pioneering ambitions of the Center . While Kazan has taken himself out of Broadway , it appears that Broadway has not yet been taken out of Kazan ? all this raising some doubt as to whether Kazan 's " recognizable stamp " will actually realize the Center 's full potential . Among the assets Kazan will bring to Lincoln Center is his characteristic directorial technique . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saturated essence of a type . " As a former actor , he has the actor 's anxiety to connect with the audience at all times , to grip the viewer at every moment so that the people on the stage are never left hanging or ignored . His work , therefore , seems supercharged . " When Kazan directs , " Arthur Miller explains , " he wants to dramatize the metaphor in every human action . There is always the overt action and something tinder the surface . You kill a man , but in what attitude ? In anger ? Or as though you were praying to him ? A good deal of the time , Kazan finds the inner metaphor and that is why his best work has tremendous depth . Now , other directors also try for this , but with Kazan it is in the forefront of his mind . If he finds nothing below the surface , his work tends to get clouded or seems overloaded . He is always on a quest for metaphors . That is his art " Beyond technique , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre . The director of plays and films is expected to form a brotherhood with a writer , a fatherhood with a company of players and craftsmen , and an alliance with producers , bankers , lawyers , and bookkeepers . He must form a family that takes him away from his own family . He must be the leader of a safari , the foreman of a construction gang , chancellor of the exchequer , and a counselor on emotional problems . " You 're expected to do this , " Kazan says , " and still keep yourself soft inside to do the creative work , " Kazan has been able to do these things , pull a production together , convince a writer he ought to tighten up his script , and somehow get the best ? or very nearly the best ? out of performers . No writer working with Kazan gets his play on without revisions . And none to whom I have talked ( Miller , Williams , Robert Anderson , and others ) have admitted that they are sorry about any changes inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them work appears to be exaggerated ; at least , no writer has admitted that Kazan ever did any rewriting of him . ) Arthur Miller made substantial revisions in Death of a Salesman , adjusting his script to the staging conceived by Kazan and Jo Mielziner , the set designer . When Archibald MacLeish 's opened in Washington , a friend called Kazan from New York and learned that the local ( Thies were sure that the play would never reach Broadway . Kazan , however , was unperturbed . He said , the friend recalls , " MacLeish is working . " Williams rewrote the third act of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to suit Kazan , who was then belabored by the drama critic , Kenneth Tynan , because the play seemed to him to be " an edifice tilted . like a giant architectural folly . " Williams , however , takes Kazan 's side . " Kazan 's suggestions resulted in making the play more affirmative , " Williams says . " He has a much more sanguine attitude toward life than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my taste , but I am fallible . Basically , the play was there with either third act and Kazan simply staged it more brilliantly than anyone else . " Tynan , after seeing the same play in London , directed by Peter Hall and offering the last act as originally written by Williams , still insisted : " I prefer the author 's third act to the modified version approved by Mr. Kazan , " but even Tynan " missed , more than I would ever have thought possible , the galvanic inspiration of Mr. Kazan 's direction . " THE PLAYWRIGHT 'S BUDDY K AZAN could not guide his playwrights if lie were not able to get along with them as well as he does . Kazan respects writers ( and until he started writing the screenplay for his new film , he even seemed to envy them ) . Furthermore , he has had a considerable range of contemporary plays and scenarios from which to choose , and has turned down the offerings of many , including Lillian Hellman , Paddy Chayefsky , and Williams . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and rejected both . He bypassed Luther . Thus writers assume thatwhen Kazan selects a script , he believes in it as much as they do . From here on , it seems , Kazan gets what he wants through a combination of chemistry , sympathy , and mutual regard . " Most directors are nervous , " Williams says . " Whenever I feel I am making a director nervous , I slink away . But Kazan is different . He makes you feel he wants you around . " On balance then , writers at least seem to feel that Kazan is an able script editor . Rini one ca n't help wondering how a play can say " what must be said " if it is to be radically altered for the sake of theatrical effectiveness . What will happen to the content of significant plays after many long weeks of rehearsal at the Center ? Kazan 's way with writers is matched by his influence with performers . Again , it is Kazan 's ability to inspire the feeling that he believes in the other person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazan was a founder of the Actors Studio , the drama school led by Lee Strasberg and dedicated to the Stanislayskv method by which an actor uses his imagination and sense of reality to " become " the character he must portray . Here , actors and actresses have been trained and exercised like Kentucky thoroughbreds and many have gone into Kazan productions . ( Oddly enough , Marlon Brando and James Dean , two of Kazan 's faster horses , were not Studio products ; the former attended about a dozen times and the latter just twice . ) Studio membership , however , has been no guarantee of a job with Kazan . He lets nothing , not even friendship or the performer 's needs , influence his casting selections . " Besides being in the Studio , " Eli Wallach recalls , " I had known Kazan for fifteen years before I worked with him . He 's a toughie . Ile knows what he wants and that 's all that counts . " Kazan also hates to use stars . He avoids them whenever possible , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stars , " he says . " It always helps to have an unknown . The unknown has n't got an investment in himself , he is n't goods for himself , his value to himself is n't diminished when people see him in something that does n't make him look like a hero , and he is n't protecting his face . He 's not an actor , he 's just a person . Marlon Brando has never been as good again as he was in Streetcar . It is n't the bloom that comes off the well-known star ? it 's the humanity . " Such is Kazan 's ruthlessness in casting , that his choices feel they could n't he in Kazan 's play unless he believed in them . They are then ready for rehearsals . During the rehearsal period , as Kazan leads his people toward his goal , he invariably establishes 72 ELIA KAZAN 'S EXPECTATIONS a honeymoon relationship with them . Actors work hard for Kazan because few directors work harder for actors . He is willing to absorb more than his share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he usually develops a somatic disturbance , such as a brief illness or a sudden need for new eyeglasses , soon after the work begins . The ordered tumult that characterizes a typical Kazan rehearsal quickly wins the performers ' respect . His industrious preparations for each day 's work ( " It 's like he sleeps in the theatre , " one actor said to me ) reassure them that the master is in control . Actors are most afraid of making fools of themselves and Kazan gives confidence that he wo n't let this happen . In return , although Kazan is frankly devious and known to use any technique that will work , including mild torture , to get a performance , the actors let Kazan fool them . They may fear and resent him , but they also worship him , and so far they have willingly worked with him . " He sloshed me with attention and charm , " Geraldine Page says , recalling the rehearsals for her role as the faded movie queen in Sweet Bird of Youth . " He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug up old screen magazines showing poses of old Hollywood beauties and left them around to inspire me . Meanwhile , he was using talk-therapy on Paul Newman , who was co-starring . Paul was nervous about acting on the Broadway stage . And Kazan kept telling him ' Do n't be nervous . ' And the more Kazan talked to him , the more anxious Paul became . He started worrying that maybe he really needed all the help he was getting from Kazan . The result was that Kazan made Paul so nervous that he gave Kazan the kind of nervous characterization he wanted for the play . " FROM RAGS TO RAVES F 0 R Lincoln Center , Kazan 's single-minded- ness , his personal magnetism , and his professional know-how can be invaluable . These qualities , however , are largely procedural . The real questions about Kazan and Lincoln Center must concern his creative purposes . " I have a great belief , " Kazan says , " that just below the surface there is a great gap between what we profess and what we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I want to show it up . " And one can gather some notion of what he means from his own life experience . Kazan 's is a familiar American success story ? the ironic kind . Born in 1909 in Kadi-kcu , a poverty-stricken suburb of Istanbul , lie was oneof eight Kazanjoglou children . The family belonged to a community of Greeks who had been victimized for generations by the Turks . At age five , Kazan was brought to Ellis Island wearing an identification tag . The memory of once having been unidentifiable except for a tag still aggravates him . In Manhattan , he went to public school and attended the Greek Orthodox church . Then , as his father 's rug business began to prosper , he moved with the family to New Rochelle , a suburb of New York which even then could hardly have been more different from Kali-ken . Being Greek and looking Jewish , however , Kazan did find that Turks and Americans could share the same prejudices . Growing up , he was an outsider who wanted in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Rochelle , Kazan was sent to a Roman Catholic church . He remembers his first confession : " I kept trying to think up some sin I 'd committed , but I was lily white . I had n't robbed anybody and I had n't told any lies . So , I made up something ? I said I 'd disobeyed my mother . " He found it impossible to fib about disobeying his father . In spite of psychoanalysis , Kazan has a grudging memory of the man . " He used to tell me , ' Go shine your shoes . Go get a haircut . ' He was always concerned about how I looked , " says Kazan , who has made it a rule in his adult life to dress carelessly . " And when I said I wanted to be an actor , he would n't believe it . He said , Go look in the mirror . ' " Kazan recalls that he had one great teacher in high school and has not forgotten what made her seem great to him : " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go into any kind of business for a career and Anna B. Shanks taught me that it was all right to be different from my father . " At Williams College , Kazan was too small for varsity football , so he played quarterback on the nonfraternity touch team . With pride , he remembers that " we were all the freaks , the Negroes , the Jews , Greeks , and outsiders ... and one year we had a hell of a team and beat all the fraternity-house boys . " Kazan directed the rest of his considerable steam into studying English ( he graduated with honors ) , waiting on tables , and joining as many extracurricular campus clubs as he could . He maintained a pace that was , according to a former roommate , " almost threatening . " Because he was so busy , he was given the nickname . " Gadget , " which has been shortened to " Gadge . " Already , it seems , he felt an out-sized compulsion to get ahead . Yet , he had no particular career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed by Potemkin and other Russian films . He had worshiped Eisenstein . Coining of age in the Depression and with the vague idea that he might like to make it as a film director , he decided to go to Yale Drama School . Here he met Molly Thacher , a fellow student , who became his wife and the mother of his four children . But he did not accomplish much in the way of theatrical efforts and left before completing the full course of study . In 1932 , he joined the Group Theatre , a repertory company with strong political impulses , as an assistant stage manager . Three years later , he was " discovered " as an actor in their production of Waiting for Lefty by Clifford Odets . In subsequent performances , especially as Fuselli , the gangster , in Odets ' Golden Boy , he was highly praised . Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times declared that Kazan was one of the most exciting actors in America . " He appeared in two movies , type-cast as a gangster and touted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone on as an actor , but by 1941 he had directed several plays , including two for the Group Theatre , and he had made up his mind that his future lay . in directing . The next year , he was hired to direct Thornton Wilder 's The Skin of Our Teeth . Since , at age thirty-three , he had little to lose , he was willing to tackle the Wilder play , a highly dubious property beforeopening night , and the formidable , preselected cast , including Fredric March , Florence Eldridge , and Tallulah Bankhead . The play was a hit , running for 359 performances , and Kazan became one of the most sought-after directors in America . For the next twenty years , he was a " success " ? pursued by the powerful and highly paid , " Yes , we 've got show business in America and not a theatre or film art . " Kazan says , reflecting on his career . " By luck , once in a while , something comes through this mess made by freaks , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time ? my flops have simply been my failures . I think of Shakespeare . He wrote five good plays and five pretty good plays . . ? . No man is a machine . You can say this about me , though : I 've always clone the scripts I wanted with the actors I wanted the way I wanted . That 's the way I 've played the game and I 'm proud of it . " In the early days of glory as a director , Kazan tackled one play after another in rapid succession , and made a picture a year for Twentieth Century-Fox . He approached theatre and films as an actor might approach them ? he had work to do rather than a particular idea to express . Out of his next four plays and two movies , Arthur Miller 's Al ! My Sons was the only one of any significance . The play was inferior to Eugene O'Neill 's The Iceman . Cometh , which was staged in the same season , but the Kazan-Miller combination carried off most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazan and Miller , they became best friends . And , as it turned out , Tennessee Williams enjoyed the production of AU My Sons so much that he decided to offer A Streetcar Named Desire to Kazan . In 1948 , Streetcar opened and Kazan 's press notices were as ecstatic as Williams ' . Newspaper critics proclaimed the dawn of the age of the director " in which the director of stage plays would receive the kind of billing that formerly had been reserved for playwrights . And many , when they referred to Kazan 's Streetcar , really meant that it was his . Yet , Kazan remained essentially the actor who had become a director . The year of Streetcar , for example , was the year in which Kazan won an Academy Award in Hollywood for directing Gentlemen 's Agreement . The film was about as far from Williams ' tragedy of frustration as one could imagine . Its apparent point was that anti-Semitic prejudice can not survive exposure . But Moss Hart , who had written the screenplay from the novel by Laura Hobson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S EXPECTATIONS Wryly , he told of the lesson a stagehand had learned from it : " From now on , Mr. Hart , I 'm going to be good to the Jewish people because you can never tell when they might turn out to be gentiles . " Kazan himself now feels that the picture was glib . The same kind of variations in Kazan 's work occurred the following year when he was represented on Broadway by Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman and in the Fox theatres by Pinky , a superficial little film on miscegenation . But if , as Kazan claims , these were really the scripts he wanted to direct , what went wrong ? By concentrating on movies for several years after Death of a Salesman , Kazan improved his technique in that medium , but he himself was still not satisfied with the results . Then , after studio executives cut 25 minutes from Viva , Zapata ! without asking his approval , he thought he knew what the trouble was : " Once and for all , I learned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the big voice in making artistic decisions . " So he set up his own production company , Newtown Productions , Inc. , with offices in New York , and determined to make films for himself . He seemed to have every Box Office Poison ? LONDON , May 8 : Writer-director John Ainsworth has planed into Britain , to make Shakespeare 's " Othello " as a motion picture , a flop when filmed some years ago by Orson Wellies . Ainsworth , who for the last seven years has been directing in Hollywood , latterly on the Warner Bros ' video series " Maverick , " is sure he can turn the Shakespearean trick . Star of his $1-million-plus project , is to be Laurence Harvey who will take on an Arabic look for the role of Othello .

May 9 , 1962chance for success although he would still have to depend upon the banks involved in the motion-picture industry for financial support ? and upon the established Hollywood distribution facilities to get his Newtown pictures before the public . Yet , even before he had launched his first film , he almost lost everything . POLITICAL PURGATIVES W H A T nearly ended Kazan 's career was the fart that , back in the Group Theatre days , he had been a Communist . For eighteen months in the early ' thirties , he had been a member of a cell with several other friends in the troupe . He had joined for the usual 1930s reasons ? the party was then an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cell members plotted to control the artistic policies of the Group . Nothing came of the plotting , times changed , and by January 1952 one member of the cell was dead and most of the others had long since quit the Communist party . In that month , Kazan was summoned to Washington to testify before an executive session of the subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities looking into Communist infiltration of the Hollywood motion-picture industry . The position of the movie industry had become so hardened that anyone who for any reason withheld any information from " The Committee " could have no future in Hollywood . The situation on Broadway was equally menacing . And , further , the committee 's procedure had also hardened : the ex-Communist could only absolve himself by publicly naming everyone he had known in the Communist party , whether or not the names were already on the public record . " The ritual , " as Murray Kempton has said , " was more important than any revelation . " At first Kazan withheld some names and gave others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , no matter where they stood on the conflicting principles involved . " Four months went by , " Molly Kazan recalls , " and Gadge was in a pressure cooker . He had to take stock of himself and decide what he believed in . We could have lived . We could have gone to England and he could have worked there . But this was a kind of political psychoanalysis for him . it was the best thing that ever happened to him . He had always been such a fair-haired boy . " Kazan voluntarily reappeared before the subcommittee in April and gave the rest of the names . In his testimony , he stated that after long and careful deliberation , he had decided that secrecy could serve only the Communists , and that the American people needed the facts to deal effectively with the Communists . " I hated a lot of the company I was testifying in , " he now says , " but I also hated the Communists . " His performance , however , disappointed many of his former friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We disagreed , " Kazan says , " on what was the right and just thing for me to do about the committee . " Kazan and Miller had been together almost daily when Miller had written Death of a Salesman . They had been best buddies . Now , their plans for staging The Crucible , Miller 's play attacking witch hunting , were abruptly canceled . They would hardly speak to one another in the next nine years . Perhaps the most poignant thing about Kazan 's later films and plays is that none of them were written by Arthur Miller , a loss to both men . Recently , however , the friendship has been restored , as Kazan says , " on a new basis . " After the hearings , Kazan made his best , and perhaps his most deeply Felt film . On the Waterfront . Since the movie makes the point that to inform is morally right , many critics see in it Kazan 's personal justification for his Washington testimony . Through the ' fifties , Kazan divided his efforts between plays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Baby Doll , whose ambiguous story line seemed more Kazan than Williams . Kazan was on the verge of becoming something more than an interesting film-maker . Thereafter , however , he tended to overload and overcook his stories , passing through such notable non-successes as A Face in the Crowd and Wild River , and culminating in last year 's Splendor in the Grass . Written by ' William Inge under Kazan 's close supervision , the latter film struck many critics as vulgar and foolish and grossed over $5 million . THE DIRECTOR WHO DID N'T DARE K AZ AN has never been able to make films with the imagination and insight of a Bergman , a Fellini , or a Truffaut . He has missed the new era in filmmaking , the flowering of intensely personal directors who write their own scenarios and say only what they have to say . He may make his voice heard yet , however , depending on the outcome of America , America , the first Kazan film to be made from a Kazan screenplay . " I have always given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " but now I am going to make people feel what I feel . " On Broadway during the past decade , Kazan has not ventured far from nor gained on A Streetcar Named Desire and Death of a Salesman . Besides Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , he made hits out of a weak Williams play , Sweet Bird of Youth , and Robert Anderson 's mawkish Tea and Sympathy . With the exception of LB. , he did not test himself on any play with an unfamiliar theme . He shunned all but the contemporary Broadway theatre . He did not direct any Ibsen , Shakespeare , or O'Neill plays , nor any by the Greeks . Indeed he has shown little interest in the classical repertory which should he a part of a purposeful theatre ; nor has he clone more than acquaint himself with the disciplined styles of acting these plays require . He has in fact confined himself to the realistic dramas which have predominated in the commercial American theatre since the ' thirties . And these , of course , are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dramatic tradition available to the Lincoln Center company . Finally he was not tempted by the new wave of angry , mystical , or absurd playwrights . " It is unthinkable , " Tennessee Williams says , " that Kazan would direct a Waiting for Godot . " He found the command to succeed at the box office onerous but , for himself , unavoidable , and he lived with it rather than turn to off-Broadway , experimental , or even university theatre , " I 've been making my living doing the things I most want to do , " Kazan says . " I 'm what I am . I can think of no other way to be . " What hope is there , then , for the Lincoln Center project ? In 1958 in The New York Times Magazine , Kazan selected ten plays for a theoretical repertory company . They were all plays by familiar twentieth-century American playwrights ? Miller , Williams , Odets , O'Neill , Inge . One hopes that Kazan 's actual selection will show more variety and daring . Kazan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of artistic and commercial values hardly calculated to rescue the American theatre from the one on Broadway . Once Kazan even told a reporter that he equated " good plays with successful plays , " to which Harold Clurman , the drama critic and director , replied , " If this is taken literally , we are preparing for the burial of the theatre as an institution of significant expression . " Yet , it would be unsportsmanlike to put down Kazan as he begins his new venture . Presidents of the United States are not the only ones who grow and change in their jobs . One just has to wait and see .
