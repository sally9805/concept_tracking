Few Canadian parliamentary issues have generated more heat and less light than the fight over a national flag . In May , Liberal Prime Minister Lester Pearson unfurled his choice for a flag - three red maple leaves on a white ground , bounded by two blue bars . And for the next six weeks , Canada 's House of Commons argued about it in a nerve-frazzling filibuster led by Tory Opposition Leader John Diefenbaker . At last Diefenbaker wryly allowed as how the debate was going nowhere . So why not submit the issue to a 15-man committee whose " unanimous decision " would be binding ? Since the Liberal minority government was not strong enough to do anything else , Pearson reluctantly agreed . <P> Last week , after 45 meetings spent studying some 1,200 designs , the com mittee submitted its choice to Parliament : a red maple leaf on a white field with heavy red bars on either side . <P> As expected , the vote was not unanimous - therefore not binding . Yet it offered Pearson the first real hope in weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give his fractious country a sense of nationhood and unity . <P> Pearson 's new source of hope springs from a sudden weakening in Diefenbaker 's Conservative leadership . Diefenbaker has long argued that Conservatives would never accept a flag that left out the Union Jack as a symbol of Canada 's historic ties to Great Britain . <P> He expected that the five Conservatives on the flag committee would vote accordingly . Four did - but not Quebec 's Thogne Ricard , and the final committee vote was 10-4 ( the chairman would vote only in case of a tie ) . Further more , all ten Quebec Conservatives in the House of Commons appear fed up with Diefenbaker 's obstructionist tac tics at a time when pressing legislation is awaiting Parliamentary action . After hearing the committee report , they cau cused and announced that they will go their own way , supporting the com mittee flag . <P> If Pearson can marshal a few more Conservative votes and get around another Diefenbaker filibuster , he may yet have his national flag - without calling for a vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
