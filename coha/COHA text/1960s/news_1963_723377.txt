txt President Kennedy attended a funeral mass today for his infant son , Patrick Bouvier Kennedy , who died early yesterday morning . In a small chapel in the residence of Richard Cardinal Cushing at Brookline , Mass. , the mass sounded a joyous , optimistic note within the Roman Catholic belief that an innocent baptized child enters immediately into heaven upon death . The celebrant , Cardinal Cushing , was clad in the traditional white vestments for the Missa de Angelis , or Mass of the Angels . Twelve other members of the Kennedy family attended the mass . Only two persons outside the family attended . They // were Cardinal Spellman , Archbishop of New York , and Judge Francis X. Morrissey of Boston : Judge Morrissey had made the funeral arrangements .

Walsh of Washington , who was the obstetrician when the baby was delivered by Caesarean section Wednesday , stayed with Mrs. Kennedy while the President flew to Brookline , a Boston suburb , by helicopter . Her physical condition was described as " excellent " by Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary . He said her over-all condition was " satislfactory . " There was no word on when she would leave the hospital for either the Kennedy summer home here or for the home of her mother , Mrs. Hugh D. Auchincloss , at Newport , R. I. Mrs. Kennedy has been sitting up in bed but not walking , Mr. Salinger said . The Kennedy children , Caroline , nearly 6 years old , and John Jr. , 2 , remained at the leased summer house that Mr. Kennedy had been staying in on Squaw Island . Mr. Salinger I declined to comment on whether the children had been told of their brother 's death . 4 Helicopters Used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cod to be with Mrs. Kennedy for a day or two in the middle of next week , possibly Tuesday or Wednesday , go back to Washington and come to the Cape again next weekend . Three Marine helicopters carried the President and members of his family to Boston today . A fourth carried only four newsmen in contrast to the large contingent that had trailed the President back and forth between Cape Cod and the children 's Hospital Medical Center in Boston during the week . The ' infant died in a highpressure oxygen chamber at the medical center , the victim of a lung disease . The helicopters today landed on the grass playing field of St. John 's Seminary , the Boston archdiocese school for secular priests , in Brookline where the President was born . Five ' black limousines carried the Presidential party to Cardinal Cushing 's residence at the corner of Commonwealth Avenue and Lake Street , almost on the Boston city line .

The final prayer after the Mass of the Angels gives the mourners reassurance with these words : " Almighty and most loving God , for no merits of their own , as soon as they leave this world , You give eterlasting life to all little children reborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have given it today to the soul of this little child . " The Mass of the Angels contrasts markedly with the solemn requiem mass for adults with its mournful funeral phrasing . The celebrant wears white as a symbol that the child is sinless because he died before reaching the age of reason , 7 years , and therefore is free of sin and welcomed into ' the company of angels . The President 's privacy as he buried his son contrasted sharply with his week-long vigil as medical science " fired all the guns we had to fire , " in the words of one Boston doctor , to ' save the infant 's life . In Boston , clusters of people lined the street corners and the entrance to the hospital during the week to applaud and cheer the President as he traveled back and forth between Cape Cod , a downtown hotel and the Children 's Medical Center . Flashguns went off in his face as many nhotogranhers. ineluding amateurs , recorded his comings and goings . His autograph was sought on all sides , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hospital staff members , technicians and nurses sought to gain a glimpse of the President in what amounts to his home town . Before the baby 's condition ' worsened to the stage where the signs were ominous , the President often smiled slightly and nodded to the crowds or gave a small wave . But by Friday , he did not seem to notice the crowds even though he had to walk a corridor lined with people to reach the hospital 's entrance . It was at the hospital entrance that the cheering was most noticeable . Yet this picture changed , too , after the baby died at 4:04 A.M. yesterday . Shortly after 9 A.M. , as the President left the hospital to fly back to his wife after an all-night vigil , there was no crowd at the hospital . Only Boston police were on hand . It was then and then only that , in public at least ; the President was alone with his sorrow .                   @ @
