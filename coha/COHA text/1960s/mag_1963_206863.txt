Citizens of the Dominican Republic do not have much practice in free elections-the last one was in 1924 , under the watchful eye of occupying U.S. Marines . Then came the era of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. and for 31 years the small Caribbean country that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti was the demesne of the dictator , his relatives and his cronies . Last week , 19 months after Trujillo 's assassination , Dominicans got another try at democracy . In calm and free elections , more than 1,000,000 voters went quietly to the polls to choose a constitutional president to lead their country for the next four years . <P> Plans for Reform . He is Juan Bosch . 53 , a novelist , journalist and longstanding political friend of such charter members of the Latin American " democratic left ' ' as Puerto Rico 's Governor Luis Munoz Marin and Venezuela 's President Romulo Betancourt . Like Munoz Marin , Bosch has great plans for reforming and developing his island country . Like Betancourt , he spent much of his life in exile plotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The largely self-educated Bosch left the Dominican Republic in 1937 , disgusted with Trujillo after " The Benefactor " personally ordered the massacre of 15,000 Haitian squatters . With Cuba as a headquarters , Bosch organized his political party , traveled widely throughout Latin America as an unofficial emissary of the anti-Communist left . <P> Hounded out of Cuba in 1958 by Dictator Fulgencio Batista , Bosch did not return when Dictator Castro took power . " I do n't say I knew he was a Communist . " says Bosch . " But I felt he was not a democrat . I was afraid of what might happen . " <P> Man of the People . After Trujillo was assassinated , Bosch went home , not to promote a revolution , but to run for President . He turned his Dominican Revolutionary Party into a peasants ' and workers ' party , proclaimed himself the candidate of the havenots , promised to distribute 16-acre farm plots among 70,000 rural families , first using former Trujillo holdings , then buying land with money from an agrarian reform tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was his habit of resigning his candidacy when things did not go right , in a manner reminiscent of Brazil 's unstable ex-President Janio Quadros . A week before election , Bosch furiously withdrew when a minor Roman Catholic priest said that some of his old writings had a Marxist ring . Bosch confronted the priest in a TV debate , got him to withdraw the charge and used the incident to advantage . <P> On election day he got 648,000 votes for a 2-to-1 margin over his more conservative opponent , Viriato Fiallo . Bosch 's party also won firm command of the legislature , and a clear mandate to put its promised reforms into action . Eight days after the great election there was a clash between troops and members of a weird religious cult in the back country that left at least 23 dead . But that had little to do with politics .
