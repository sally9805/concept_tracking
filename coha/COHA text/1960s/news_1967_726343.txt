txt It rained this week in southern Florida but the plight of the parched Everglades is unchanged . It would take weeks of rain to relieve the worst drought in 25 years . Everglades National Park , comprising 7 percent of the total Everglades area , is suffering most . Water diversions have drained much of the park 's water table . Only normal rainfall has provided survival for plants and animals . Good rain in 1966 eased the drought of 1965 . And helpful waters were released by the huge Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District . Since the early 1960 's , the park has been cut off from its normal flow of water from the north by the flood control district . The district has impounded the park 's water source in Lake Okeechobee and three " conservation areas " from which water has been released to the park only sporadically and only after much public pressure . District engineers say the water has been so carefully guarded because of unusually low water levels both in the lake and the conservation areas . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its muckland soil has slowly been drying out . The 1966 reprieve ? heavy rains plus Hurricane Alma ? brought abundant new water . The marine organisms in the Everglades began to revive . Survival seemed possible until a permanent plan for sufficient water could be worked out with the flood district and the United States Army Corps of Engineers . But this year , the drought has returned not only to devastate the park but thousands of acres of south Florida ranchland . Unless controlled water is released , say some warnings from the area , the famed park may not survive .
