COMMON MARKET <P> ( See Cover ) <P> For nine centuries , since William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings , the English Channel has stood as the " moat defensive ' ' between Britain and her foes , between the " blessed plot " and the " envy of less happier lands . " Today , Paris-London jets pass over the Channel tides in three minutes ; nuclear missiles would blast across in as many seconds . The balance of envy has changed . Increasingly prosperous Britons , who swarm across to the Continent by the thousands each summer , return with European notions of comfort , elegance and efficiency that have breached England 's insularity more surely than any invader . <P> But if the Channel is no longer a moat , it is more than a memory . In the missile age , as in the Middle Ages , it is still the demarcation line of British sovereignty , the symbol of differences in law and language , attitudes and institutions that have historically separated Englishmen from Europeans-and mingled their blood on countless European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are always willing to die for foreigners-but not to live with them . " <P> This month , some 400 years since Britain was driven from her last French possession , the island nation approaches the climax of a historic effort to vault the Channel and bind her fortunes indissolubly to those of the new , united , booming Western Europe . This decision will deeply affect Britain 's relations with 724 million Commonwealth citizens . Britons who want to remember the sails of Drake and Raleigh , and the balance sheets that once followed the flag around the world , are being asked to turn their backs on what little remains of the Empire and to abandon ( or so many believe ) yesterday 's wide horizons for a nearby , still suspect coast . And yet , to an extent unforeseeable only a few years ago , the decision to join Europe 's Common Market may also be a new adventure for Britain and restore British prestige and power . The outcome will influence the future of Europe and of the entire free world . <P> Unite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest on a grey October day in Paris last year . Behind the closed doors of a high-ceilinged conference room in the Quai d'Orsay , Britain 's Lord Privy Seal , Edward Richard George Heath , formally notified ministers of the six Common Market nations that his government had reached " a great decision , a turning point in our history . " In a deep , resonant voice , Heath declared : " We desire to become full , wholehearted and active members of the European Community in its widest sense , and to go forward with you in the building of a new Europe . " Gravely , he added : " Europe must unite or perish . We are convinced that our destiny is intimately linked with yours . " <P> Never before had a British government committed itself so emphatically to economic and political union with Europe . For centuries , Britain had practiced what Disraeli elegantly called " abstention " from Europe , except when a drastic upset in the Continental balance of power made it necessary to intervene .
