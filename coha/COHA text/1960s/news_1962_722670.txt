txt One of the biggest credit items in Uncle Sam 's international account books is about to shrink ? pei haps drastically . The Item consists of exports of aircraft , missiles and their electronic innards . Last year , at $1.2 billion , they topped foreign sales of every other U.S. product line except industrial machinery This year they started off even better , from January through April aerospace exports . at $507 million . zoomed 30% ahead of the 1961 period . Now , however , this huge market faces a triple threat : Big jet airliners , a near-U S monopoly to date , are in world-wide oversupply ; Foreign competition is tightening in the market for short-range jets and small utility aircraft , and is beginning to appear even in the big-jet field ; Foreign nations are stepping up production of military planes under U.S. licenses  --  a process that returns far fewer dollars to U.S. firms than outright sale of these craft . Lockheed , Douglas See Drop The results already are marked . Though the industry as a whole may still match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , a number of big U.S. aerospace companies expect their foreign sales to drop this year despite the fast start . Lockheed Aircraft Corp . expects its 1962 export sales to drop to $225 million this year . from $244.5 million last year ; Douglas Aircraft Co. fears its foreign sales will tumble to $90 million from $156 million in 1961 . In 1963 these troubles are expected to get much worse . The industry has " very little sold for that year , " says W. Jerome Kane , chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association 's export committee and a Boeing Co. vice president . Boeing , he says . " wo n't make more than half the deliveries in 1963 that we will in 1962 . " Longer-range prospects also are in doubt . Industry strategy for an export comeback con , dentrates on developing models for the next " generation " of transport planes and missiles , persuading European countries to use U.S.-made vehicles in space research shots , and arming NATO military forces with U.S. missiles . Some of the projects show promise ; NATO already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fired from NATO jet fighters . Supersonic Transport Race But in developing supersonic jet transports for the air travel of the 1970s , U.S. firms must race a team project of British Aircraft Corp and Sud Aviation of France . At the recent Farnborough , England , air show , this team displayed a dart-shaped model of a plane that would carry 100 passengers at 2.2 times the speed of sound . or about 1.450 miles an hour Who 's leading in this race is unclear . The British-French group , once expected to have a plane ready for airline service as early as 1968 , has now postponed its target date to sometime after 1970 ? about in line with the U.S. schedule . And engineers wrangle as to whether the U.S. steel or the British-French aluminum design is better . Nevertheless , Sir George Edwards . managing director of British Aircraft , still claims " we are already three years ahead of the U.S. in design and preparation . " All this could be ominous news for aerospace stockholders . Exports last year ! accounted for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . A drop in these sales , say industry sources , ca n't help but hold down profits . The threatened decline is of concern to the Government , too . Last year 's aerospace exports , running more than $1 billion above aerospace imports of about $152 million , helped mightily to hold the deficit in the U.S. balance of payments to $2.5 billion . The balance-of-payments deficit is the excess of total U.S. payments to foreigners over total receipts from foreign sources ; it is one of the nation 's leading problems because it puts dollars into the hands of foreign countries , which can use them to buy from the U.S. the gold to which the value of the dollar is tied . In big jets , the decline apparently has already started  --  mostly because enough of these $6 million craft now are flying to provide all the service the world 's air travelers need . Foreign airlines flew the North Atlantic , the richest international air travel market , with almost half their seats empty in the first half of 1962. according to the International Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales for Douglas . says an airline must fill 60% of its seats before it can consider buying new planes . - Though shipments of big jets accounted for a large part of the sharp use in U.S. aerospace exports varly this year , Harry Carter , Boeing 's manager of market research , figm es commercial jet shipments to foreigners for all 1962 will drop to $306.5 million , from $334.8 million in 1961 . He expects a sharper drop to $249 million in 1963 . " We 're finished with sales of big jets in quantity , " says Boeing Vice President Kane . With the big-jet market saturated , aerospace , executives say , foreign demand is switching to " compact " jets  --  medium and short-range craft priced at about $2.5 million to $3.9 million each . And in this market , U.S. planes are being outsold by the French Caravelle and two new British models , British Aircraft 's BAC 111 and Hawker Siddeley 's DH 121 Trident . Airlines around the world have ordered a total of 63 of these foreign planes for delivery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those years only 12 of its Boeing 727 model , a plane with three aft-mounted engines that can carry 114 passengers 1.500 miles nonstop . Douglas has not even decided whether to build a compact jet ; it has designed one resembling the twin-jet BAC 111 but , unsure of the foreign market , is waiting to build up a backlog of U.S. orders before putting it into production . Foreign competition does n't stop there , either . The Aerospace Industries Association estimates exports of small , utility aircraft will drop about 10% this year , to $27 million ; that 's largely because of competition from such planes as the British Airdale and Terrier , which haul two to three passengers ' at 125 to 150 miles an hour . De Haytiland. the British concern , unveiled a trim little nine-place executive jet at the Farnborpugh air show . And on the big-jet front , British Aircraft has sold 66 ' of Its ** coating $6 million to $7 mil- lion each , to give U S companies come unaccustomed competition in that market . Licensing Deals ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in military aerospace expo , ts . U S. companies are well aware that , while they make a 2% , profit on selling a $1 million military plane or component to a foreign nation , they get only half that much in royalties when the foreign country makes the same product under license . " But if we do n't do it this way ( use licensing agreements the customer will buy the equipment fiom someone else , either from another American firm or a foreign maker , " says one aerospace official . In any case , licensing agreements have become increasingly common The way in which Lockheed sold West Germany , Holland , Belgium . Italy . Canada and Japan on using a total of 1,800 of its F-104 Starfighters is typical . Each country agreed to buy a few F-104s built in Lockheed 's Burbank , Calif. , shops Lockheed in turn licensed them to turn out the rest in facilities that the purchasing countries have been building while taking delivery of the first few planes from the U.S. Result : While Starfighter deliveries helped push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliveries are certain to decline as Lockheed nears the end of the 100-plane U.S. production run called for by the agreements . Some U.S. executives think at least a few of these export difficulties may begin to ease , relatively soon . For all his pessimism on 1962 and 1963 prospects , Mr. Carter , the Boeing market researcher , thinks U.S commercial jet sales in 1964 will rise to about $403 million . He looks for reorders from airlines presently using big U.S.-made jets , rising sales of the new " compact " jets and good sales of jet cargo planes . But other executives foresee much more trouble selling even the hottest U.S. plans to - foreign countries in competition with the new planes the foreigners themselves are building . " In England , for example , " says one industry spokesman , " the aircraft manufacturing industry is partly nationalized and the airlines are totally nationalized . They 're subject to a lot of pressure to buy their own country 's equipment . "                @ @ @ @ @
