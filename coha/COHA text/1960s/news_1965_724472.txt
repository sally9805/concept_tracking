txt Washington , Jan. ** joint congressional committee on atomic energy today sharply accused the navy of slipshod , dangerous practices in the nonnue/ear aspects of the submarine building program . Basing its findings on the Thresher submarine disaster that claimed 129 lives , the committee warned that drastic management and personnel changes are necessary to insure increased safety of thousands of submariners and higher performance for their ships . The navy said that as a result of the disaster it has set in motion a whole new set of safety procedures , changed operating methods , and spared no expense or effort to avoid a repetition of the sinking in its underseas fleet . 20 Major Changes There have been about 20 major changes , many of which may be made public next week by the committee . Its hearings were held in June and July , 1963 . " It is extremely =fortunate , " said the foreword of the committee report , signed by Sen. John 0 . Pastore R. Li , the chairman , " that this tragedy had to occur to bring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee is favorably impressed , however , with the scope of the navy 's planned program to improve the quality and safety of new submarines and those already in the fleet . " Cause Not Known The committee disclosed for the first time examples of sloppy workmanship , excessive burocracy , cost-cutting practices that actually resulted in additional expenses , and poor design and planning work In the program costing billions of dollars . The congressmen found practices , conditions , and standards in the Thresher " were short of these required to insure ' safe operation . " The precise cause of the sinking 200 miles Off Boston on April 10 , 1963 , never has been determined . " The committee said the Thresher was built basically to two different sets of standards stringent requirements for the nuclear power plant and far less regard for the rest of the ship . Rep. Chet Holifield D. , Cal. said the double standard was akin to placing a buggy wheel on an automobile . " Of particular note , " the report said , " is that the technical specification requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far More strict for the nuclear power plant than for the rest of the ship . " Effect in War " " It is also obvious that while nuclear power was revolutionizing the submarine as a weapons system during the last 10 years , the more conventional aspects of the submarine and its safety devices were not keeping pace with the more stringent performance requirements of greater endurance , higher speed , and deeper submergence . . . . " One change the navy has Made is not to send its subs to great depths . Officers say this has not hurt the peace time operation , but would have an effect in war . The committee noted that in the nuclear power system of the Thresher there was a continuity of technical manageInent because Vice Adm . Hyman G. Rickover has been in 6. harge since its inception . But it said that in the nonnuclear Parts of the submarine " there were so many changes of personnel in responsible positions involved in the design and construction of the ship that fixing responsibility is impossible . " Navy Offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present military technical management concepts whereby competent individuals will be assigned technical responsibility for time periods commensurate with the time required to complete a technical project without adverse effect on their promotion opportunities , the high standards of efficiency and safety required will not be attained , " the committee said . The navy said it feels these objections are being met and overcome by extending tours of duty to four and six years for senior officers . More officers , too , are now anxious to get into the program than there were in the early days of the nuclear program . Submarine morale , the navy says , is very high and there is no recruitment problem by comparison with the rest of the fleet . The navy never released full details of its board of inquiry 's 1,700-page report , partly on the ground it might hint morale . The inquiry report also includes much classified information , items such as diving depths and speed . This type of information was censored out of the congressional report . Calls for Review Testimony of Rickover disclosed that he viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy of design , construction , and inspection that has been permitted in our naval shipbuilding programs . " He said , " I think it is important that we reevaluate our present practices where , in the desire to make advancements , we may have forsaken the fundamentals of good engineerthe ability to replace water in t " nkc with air so it can rise quickly to the surface ? was small . The navy said changes are being made there , too . On another occasion , Rickover. said , he found officers lacking in data on how they were going to conduct a dive . To remedy the situation , Rickover said , " I consider that the most important step to be taken by the navy is to eliminate transient technical management . " Changes in Officers Rickover said there is such a changeover in the top brass that it was impossible to fix blame except to say , " the navy is responsible . " He cited the case of the Thresher . During the five to six years ! compassed in the design and construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built . There also were three different production officers , five different planning officers , and three design superintendents . In addition , the bureau of ships had two chiefs ; six or more heads of the design division ; and three heads of the submarine desk . Rear Adm . C. A. Cur t z e , deputy chief of the bureau of ships , said he agreed with his boss , Rear Adm . William A. Brockett , that " we moved too fast and too far in areas of offensive and defensive capabilities . Submarine safety did not keep pace . " The first attack nuc le a rpowered submarine , the Nautilus , completed its trials in 1955 . Sea trials for the first Polaris missile ship , the George Washington , were completed in 1959 . Altho on station in ' the Atlantic for some time , the first missile sub , the Daniel Boone , did n't go on patrol in the Pacific until late last year . 91 Are Authorized There are now 29 submarines with 16 Polaris missiles apiece in commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two and three months at a time as a part of the nation 's missile deterrent . They cost about 114 million dollars apiece , compared with about 66 million apiece for the attack subs which number 21 ? with 51 planned . The building program for the attack submarines has been considerably slowed by the new construction requirements . Additional funds are being spent on overhauls of existing ships .

Slated to Be Closed The Thresher was overhauled in the Portsmouth , N. H. , nav3 yard , now slated to be closed just before its fatal dive . Mad navy said the closing is not con meted with the tragedy . Rick over said an inspection indi cated that the Thresher weal to sea with several hundred substandard welds in piping much of which is exposed extreme pressures . The admiral also said it ap peered that gadgetry in Om nonnuclear areas of the sub marines should probably be re examined , and challenged the necessity of so much automate% equipment . A few changes havl been made in this area .
