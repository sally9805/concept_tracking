Russians are buggy about bugs . They hide listening devices in mattresses , un der flowerpots , behind wallpaper . Three years ago , they even bugged the eagle 's beak in the Great Seal of the U.S. that hung in the American embassy in Mos cow . It is all part of the espionage game , and looking for hidden mikes is considered high good sport by Americans in Russia . <P> But last week came word of a new Soviet bug - a really non-cricket one . <P> A U.S. military attache met a diplomatic source in a Moscow bar , ordered a martini , then engaged his companion in deep conversation . The waiter brought the drinks ordered - including an extra martini , which he set on a nearby fireplace mantle . The attache finished his first drink in a few minutes , but then he could n't locate the waiter to order an other . Thirstily , he picked up the marti ni from the mantle , took a sip , then bit into the olive - ouch . <P> That was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its " toothpick " was really an antenna . The attache was appalled - not so much at the device itself , but at its location : " If the damned thing can work under gin , " he gasped , " it can work anywhere . "
