( See Cover ) <P> Nothing except the Mint can make money without advertising . <P> - Thomas Babington Macaulay <P> " Madison Avenue , " the all-purpose handle for the advertising business , is a street named Desire that starts in Manhattan and wends into every household in the land . Americans are seeing more advertisements now-an average of 1,600 per person per day-and whether they are enjoying them less is a matter of argument . But the inescapable fact is that the pleas and promises of Madison Avenue dance before the eyes of the ordinary American whenever he reads , rides , watches television , strolls down the street or strikes a match . The $12 billion that U.S. business will spend on advertising this year exceeds the gross national products of Austria and Norway combined . <P> Behind this vast expenditure lies one truth that both critics and practitioners of advertising agree upon : advertising is an aggressively creative force that makes music at the cash registers by stimulating the public 's desire to acquire goods . This is an overriding consideration for the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce more than it consumes and when nothing would help the economy more than a surge in consumer spending . As the U.S. economy grows in size and complexity and the cost of labor increases , advertising is an indispensable substitute for the personal salesmanship of times past . The genial clerk who used to sell undecided customers with the assurance that " my own family uses it " is steadily giving way to the self-service shopping cart . Today , advertising is the magnet that draws customers into the nation 's supermarkets and department stores , and the prime mover of human inventiveness . Emerson notwithstanding , a man has small inspiration to build a better mousetrap unless he can mass-produce it and shout to the world about it . <P> The use of advertising as the strongest force in moving goods is a uniquely American contribution to economic life-and like most things American , constantly in flux . Born as a big business with the rise of national magazines around the turn of the century , advertising has changed bewilderingly since then , and today is changing faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is destined to become even more omnipresent : in dollar volume , advertising in the U.S. has doubled since 1950 , is expected to double again in the decade to come . And as it grows bigger and more complicated , it is also becoming costlier . The average U.S. business now spends $1 on advertising for every $70 in sales , v. $1 for every $100 in 1947 . <P> As advertising becomes more pervasive , so does debate about it . Never before have admen been so concerned about the future of their business or so nervous over charges that Madison Avenue is somehow corrupting the standards of Main Street .
