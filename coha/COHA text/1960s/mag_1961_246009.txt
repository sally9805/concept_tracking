Seven months ago , when Turkey 's Strongman General Cemal Gursel ordered the leaders of the deposed regime of Adnan Menderes to stand trial , expectation was that their cases would be wrapped up expeditiously , the junta 's revolt against the Menderes government vindicated neatly , and Menderes &; Co. put out of the way conveniently . But by last week , the i sth trial on Yassiada Island ended inconclusively , the 16th , 17th , 18th and 19th trials were under way , the 1,000th witness took the stand to give testimony , and the Turks were frankly tired of the whole thing . <P> From the outset , the Yassiada trials went badly . Early prosecution charges that old ex-President Celal Bayar , 77 , , sold a state-owned Afghan hound for personal gain did not stand up . An accusation that ex-Premier Menderes had arranged for the murder of his illegitimate child proved false ; Menderes admitted readily that he had fathered the child in an illicit affair with an opera singer , but proved he had nothing to do with its death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Menderes threatened ex-President ( and Republican Party leader ) Ismet Inonu with assassination could not be substantiated . <P> <P> What had the trials proved ? Among other things , that : <P> Adnan Menderes misused $1,148,487 in secret state funds for private purposes - personal income tax . hotel bills , etc . <P> Democratic Party leaders actively fomented the disastrous 1955 anti-Greek riots in Istanbul , in which 4,000 Greek-owned stores were sacked and burned , three Greeks killed . But all that the prosecution could prove against Menderes personally was that he had ordered up a vigorous but nonviolent demonstration against the local Greeks as a protest against Greek demands in Cyprus . Against proud and unbending ex-President Bayar , nothing at all was proved . <P> Menderes and other top Democrats ordered harassment of opposition Republican Party politicians . Item : a crowd of Democratic Party followers was ordered by Menderes to demonstrate against Inonu in May 1959 , overzealously pelted Inonu 's car with stones and beat on it with sticks . Item : on Menderes ' order , the army harassed Inonu on a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours , turned him away from a village he was attempting to visit . Item : Democratic Party goons in the Anatolian towns of Canakkale and Geyikli bullied , attacked and injured Republican politicians , though not provably at Menderes ' orders . <P> Top Democrats were responsible for the mob-wrecking of the anti-Menderes newspaper , Demokrat Izmir . ( Menderes ' direct complicity was not proved ; yet the state prosecutor demanded the death penalty for him . ) <P> Istanbul Democratic leaders were responsible for financial hanky-panky while expropriating choice Istanbul real estate under a Menderes scheme to modernize the ancient city . Faithful Democratic Party supporters were handsomely compensated for their expropriated properties , while Republicans were shortchanged . Still to be proved : that Menderes was personally culpable.
