Three major stories in this week 's TIME deal with one aspect or another of the overriding issue of the day-how the U.S. should deal with international Communism . <P> <P> FOR the ESSAY , which is a refresher course on Communism for old as well as young , the editors undertook to determine the present state of the movement , its strengths and weaknesses , its fractured divisions and mischievous diversions , in every area of the world . Searching queries went out to 21 key points on the Communist compass . The question we wanted to answer was : Do Communist subversion , infiltration , and desire for control of legitimate nationalist movements remain realities ? The essentially affirmative answer is set forth in detail in the ESSAY . <P> <P> PRESIDENT JOHNSON made the week 's big news , and he also made it clear that he had no doubts as to the Communist goals in Southeast Asia . The cover story in THE NATION takes him through the most eventful week of his presidency-one of the more remarkable weeks in the history of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's narrative . It offers a considered assessment of the President 's role as Commander in Chief of a nation at de facto war , as a get-things-done domestic leader , and as the boss of his Administration . Beyond this , it presents a sensitive reading on how the people of the country feel about President Johnson and his leadership . For this part of the story , TIME reporters across the country interviewed men and women in all pursuits-businessmen , laborers , farmers , professional men , housewives-not merely polling them , but testing mood and sentiment as well . <P> <P> THE third story shows Communism very much in action . <P> Since February , when the President ordered air strikes north of the 17th parallel , TIME 'S five regular correspondents in the area have filed some 446,000 words to New York . When Viet Nam became a bigger war last week , the editors decided to make a new general assessment of the U.S. military position and strategy . All week , over our new highspeed circuit from Saigon , the cables chattered in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the story of U.S. servicemen digging in in enclaves whose odd names may soon be familiar to all Americans . Status &; Strategy in THE WORLD is a scorecard of the war to date .
