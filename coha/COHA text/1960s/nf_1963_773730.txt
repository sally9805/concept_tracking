' After having been reconstituted in 1791 the order of Avouds was suppressed in 1794.2 Bands Bands for legal , official , ecclesiastical , and academical use appeared in the mid-seventeenth century.3 All men of law , members of corporations including universities , court-functionaries , and churchwardens wore a variety of bands which differed from the bands of priests in being very long and reaching down right over the chest . This kind was made of cambric or linen , whereas the ecclesiastical bands were of black gauze with the white hem showing on the outside and were much shorter . The bands in both cases were a development of the seventeenth-century lay collar.4 Mourning for Men of Law Until the Revolution all men of law wore as a sign of mourning a long thin piece of plain black stuff divided into two unequal pieces and resting on the shoulder .

By the middle of the eighteenth century two forms were favoured by men of law and officials . One was the cauliflower ' wig , formal in shape with rows of side curls , one long curl running the length of the lower edge of the wig , the wig falling behind in a long bob.2 Such a one was worn by the famous financier and statesman A. R. J. Turgot ( 1727 ? 81 ) as a sign of his official standing as Intendant of Limoges . ' The second , which was called the newly-grow-ing ' wig , was shorter , had many side curls , and fell behind in one thick queue , the queue having three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end.4 By 1783 advocates in general wore grey wigs with one side curl and a thick queue , ' or three long thin queues. ? In the provinces as in Paris the magistracy , such as mayors , echevins , and consuls , all wore wigs of these types . In the municipal accounts for Bayonne in 1786 we read : 36 livres for the dressing of the town council 's wigs . ' ' The younger generation of advocates in the 178o 's began , however , to give up wigs , and to wear their own hair tied behind in a queue.8 III . 1790 TO THE END OF THE CENTURY In 1790 the dress of advocates was abolished as also that of the members of the Tribunal de Cassation , but tribunal judges , as they were now called , were given a // special dress , a black cloak of cloth or silk with facings of the same material and colour , with a ribbon falling in front like a sling of the colours of the tricouleur . From this hung a medal engraved with the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in front and sur-mounted by black plumes . The costume of Commissaires du Roi ( equivalent to advocates of royal courts before 1790 ) was similar except that they had a gold button in front of the cap ; Greffiers had the same dress , but their cap was without plumes . ' Except for medallions suspended from tricouleur ribbons , tricouleur sashes , and tricouleur plumes in some instances ( e.g. the cloth medallion of Justices of the Peace , a new order created in 1791 ) there was no other legal dress for four years . In 1795 the Committee of Public Instruction proposed a dress for members of the Legislative Assembly to consist of a blue coat , white breeches , and a short scarlet cloak . This was unpopular and was never really adopted , Henri Gregoire with reason saying that only a long robe was suitable to that or any other Assembly 's dignity.2 In the same year the Directory on coming to power asked the well-known painter J.-L . David ( 1748 ? 1825 ) to draw up a system of dress for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fur-nished by the Minister of the Interior to Citizen Grasset Saint-Sauveur , who in 1796 brought out a book containing coloured plates of David 's designs with a commentary . Several editions , varying in quality , appeared in England during the year . From them we learn that the judiciary , a body which was placed under the Minister of Justice , wore such a type of classically inspired dress as was worn by the // Council of the Five Hundred and the Ancients , the two legislative assemblies . The dress of members of the High Court of Justice consisted of a long white woollen tunic edged with the tricouleur in lines , a white cloak , similarly edged , falling below the knees at the front and the back , on the left side caught up on the shoulder with a button , on the right open from a little way above the elbow , a white sash with tricouleur tassels , a round white bonnet , red silk showing through the slashings surrounding it , and black boots in imitation of Roman caligae ( Pl. gc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same style of dress , but their tunics and bonnets were light blue , their sashes red , and their cloaks white . This court judged the ac-cusations brought by the legislative body either against its own members , or against those of the Directory . ' There was only one Tribunal de Cassation under the Directory . Its function was to judge of appeals against the decisions of the other tribunals . The dress of its members consisted of a light-blue tunic edged with red , a round light-blue bonnet , a red sash , and a white cloak edged with the tricouleur . The Commissaries of the Directory had the same functions as the Crown lawyers , whose office was finally formally abolished in 1792 . They wore a completely black dress consisting of a long coat with large lapels and large turned-back cuffs , a long waistcoat , tights , and a sash . In addition they wore a round black beaver hat with the brim fastened up on one side with a button and cord , from which rose black feathers.z Then there was the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Correctional Justice.3 All wore a black manteau a petit collet ( cloak-gown ) fastened // by a lace at the neck and reaching as far as the knee , a black breeches suit , and a tall black hat with the brim turned up in front and surmounted by black feathers . Round the neck was a silk cord of various blends of the tricouleur , from which hung a metal symbol , varying accord-ing to the tribunal to which the wearer belonged . Thus for the civil tribunal it consisted of a silver medallion , with the design engraved on it of an eye , hanging from a white ribbon with a red border and a blue border ; for the criminal tribunal a miniature bundle of rods with an axe in metal suspended from a red ribbon with a blue bor-der and a white border ; and for the Tribunal of Correc-tional Justice a bundle of rods without an axe in metal suspended from a blue ribbon with a white border and a red one . Justices of the Peace wore a black breeches suit and wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ribbon with very narrow borders , one blue and one red . They had also a wand of office , a long white stick with an ivory head on which was engraved a black eye . ' Municipal officers had no particular distinction of dress except that they wore a tricouleur scarf ' , which was worn slung from the right shoulder to the left thigh . The scarf of the President of Administrations had gold tassels on the end of it . All presidents wore a round hat , the brim not turned up at all , with a small tricouleur band and tricouleur feathers , but only the President of Administrations had gold tassels on the band.2 Under the Consulate ( 1799 ) the magistrature of France was again reorganized . Bonaparte reconstituted the Bar , created the Court of Appeal from the general magistracy , and made the Court of Cassation the supreme tribunal . // In i800 , after some hesitation ? for he realized with what distaste a revival of the old legal dress , in itself associated with the monarchy , might be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prescribed for all except Greffiers , consisted of a short flap-collared manteau a petit collet , black and of silk , a long lawn cravat , and a three-cornered black hat . The turned-up sides of this hat were held in position each by black velvet knots , and round the whole cap ran a velvet ribbon with one black silk button laid upon it . The ridiculous plumes were removed . ' Thus all magistrates were given this black dress , but presidents , vice-presidents , and judges of the Tribunal of Cassation had their cloaks faced with purple silk , while they were otherwise distinguished by having pieces of gold braid on each of the three sides of their three-cornered hats and a line of gold running round the edges . In 18o 1 these officers and other chief magistrates were given a dress to be worn out of court consisting of a black manteau a petit collet embroidered with gold on the facings , the collar , and the three-cornered hat , but in 1803 this dress was simplified.2 // 1 . ENGLAND ( a ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence seems to be pro-vided by a seal affixed to a document of the time of Henry II , an original grant of land to the canons of Osulveston , Leics. , made by a judge , Robert Grimbald . On the seal Grimbald appears dressed in a simple tunica . ' There is no documentary evidence until 1292 when Edward I ordered the Keeper of the Great Wardrobe to make over to justices of the King 's Bench , Justices of the Common Pleas , and Barons of the Exchequer various materials of lighter weight for their robes for summer wear and of heavier weight for those to be worn during the winter : To each of them for their summer vestments ( or Robes ) for the present year , half a short cloth , and one piece of fine linen silk ; and for the winter season another half of a Cloth colour Curt , with a Hood , and three pieces of Fur of white Budge . And for the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lord , half a Cloth colour Curt , with a Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with seven tires of Minever , and two Furs of silk . ' // We can see from this description how far the dress of judges had in the course of one hundred years come to assume a particular character . Throughout the fourteenth century evidence increases . Thus in a Close Roll of 1347 Edward III commanded the Keeper of the Great Wardrobe to furnish William Scot and other justices with cloth , silk , budge , and miniver accord-ing to the season . ' As yet there seems to have been no distinction between the dress of chief and other justices.2 In the following year Sir William de Thorpe , Chief Justice of the King 's Bench , Sir William Basset , and Sir Roger de Bankwell , his fellow justices in the same court , were also allowed materials and furs for their winter robes.3 From further Wardrobe Accounts , such as those of 1361 , 1384 , and 1388 , we see that judges ' robes were by no means confined to certain colours , though green cloth was particularly favoured for the robes of the puisnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used green taffeta for their summer robes.4 We read of a Cote and Mantle of green Tartarin streked with gold ' and a hood of russet cloth ' .5 The summer robes of justices of the King 's Bench and of the Common Pleas which were given to them in 1388 as livery of the king , are described as for the two Chief justices 10 ells of green Cloth long , and 24 ells of green Taffata ; and each of the rest io ells of green Cloth long ' .6 Other colours came to be employed in the following century . In 1444 John Fray , Chief Baron of the Exchequer , was to have // a dress of violet in grain ' for winter wear and green cloth ' for summer . The colour still varied according to the whim of the king , but even before this the cut of the dress was becoming formalized ' although for a long time still influenced by lay fashion . A good example of the character of the winter dress of a judge of about 1350 is to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacobus , described as a judge . It consists of a scarlet hood with a flat liripipe of the same colour hanging down behind , and over it a roll of miniver round the neck . Over a closed , tight-sleeved tunica the judge wears a pink-violet armelausa . He is bare-headed ( Pl . IOA ) .2 In another illuminated manuscript of the same period , a different volume of Jacobus 's Omne Bonum , 3 are further examples of the dress of judges . In the miniature on folio 50 verso a seated judge wears a royal blue sleeveless tabard with the side slits decorated with buttons , and a shoulder piece ' with an opening down the front . Through this opening can be seen the low round neck of the red super-tunica . On each side of the opening in the shoulder piece ' is a white decoration , the two halves when fastened together forming a cross , similar to the gammadia on the early Christian tunica.4 The judge has a bright red pileus with a stalk ' apex edged round the crown with miniver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same manuscript in folio 52 . Here he wears a pink pileus with a stalk ' apex furred with miniver round the bottom , and over a scarlet supertunica which sweeps the ground he has a shorter royal blue sleeved tabard cut low at the neck . His shoulder piece ' is of the same character , similarly PLATE 1OB // decorated with gammadia . The use of gammadia was a passing fashion . Although as early as this a certain kind of dress , con-sidered as befitting justices , seems to have been recognized , it must not be assumed that it had gained universal acceptance . For example , a judge , Sir Richard Wil-loughby ( d. ? 1362 ) , appears on his tomb at Willoughby-in-the-Wolds , Notts. , simply wearing a houppelande , a purely lay courtly dress . ' It was the armelausa which came to be especially associated with judges . Originally the dress of nobles in France ( manteau ) , it was no doubt presented to judges as part of their livery by kings , who regarded judges as nobles in virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobles themselves . The armelausa was a loose mantle fastened on the right shoulder : Sed iusticiarius factus . . . clamide induc-tur , firmata super humerum eius dexterum ' .2 It was open on the right side and closed on the left.3 We may trace its origin as far back as the lorum , a mantle of similar shape worn by consuls of the late Western Roman and early Byzantine Empire in their diptychs.4 It is to be seen worn by late Roman emperors and also Byzantine emperors when a facing bust is depicted on a gold solidus as a robe of state ; and it no doubt owed its origin to the convenience it gave to the wearer by freeing the right arm from a cumbrous robe when the right side was held back by a fibula . A description of it in Byzantine times will suffice to show how it historically descended to the // Middle Ages . When on the occasion of the visit of the East Roman emperor Manuel Comnenus ( 1143 ? 8o ) to Antioch , then the capital of the Frankish crusader kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that his long mantle was held back on the right side by a buckle at the shoulder to leave his arm free . ' In the Western world in the Middle Ages it was known as a mantle , and was worn not only by nobles but by certain eccle-siastics and by other persons of high standing . In the will of St. Everard of Friuli is mentioned mantellum unum de auro paratum , cum fibula aurea ' . z In the fifteenth century monumental brasses and effigies become important . A brass of Sir John Cassy , Chief Baron of the Exchequer ( d. 1400 ) in Deerhurst Church , Glos. , shows him wearing mantle , roller ' hood and coif , 3 while Sir William Gascoigne , a judge who died in 1419 , appears on his tomb at Harewood , Yorks. , W.R. , wearing a close-sleeved supertunica and a shoulder piece ' , with his hood on his head and its liripipe hanging forward over his left shoulder.4 It was in this century that the dress of judges definitely became fixed as the pileus or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its miniver hood , fitting close to the neck , a short flat liripipe hanging down behind , and a long supertunica with close sleeves . Some-times a sleeveless tabard was worn as the outer garment . The supertunica was ankle-length and was usually girded . At this time the broad black silk stole was first worn . The armelausa was used on formal occasions . ' Armelausa ( capa ) and supertunica ( vestimentum ) are mentioned as items in the will ( 1403 ) of John de Scarle , Lord Chancellor 1399-1401.6 // Good examples of the armelausa on brasses are to be found in those of Sir John Juyn , Chief Justice of the King 's Bench ( 1439 , St. Mary Redcliffe , Bristol ) , ' of Judge Cottesmore ( 1439 , Brightwell Baldwyn , Oxon. ) , 2 and of Sir Thomas Urswyk ( 1479 , Dagenham , Essex ) , Baron of the Exchequer.3 Brasses of this period which show the judge 's dress of skull-cap , supertunica , shoulder piece ' , hood , and armelausa appear at Watford , Herts. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As was the case in later times the coif was always worn by judges in common with serjeants-at-law , ' but the skull-cap or some other head-dress such as the pileus in nearly every example covers it completely . In the brass , however , of the judge Sir Peter Arderne ( 1467 ) at Lattan , Essex , he wears a coif without anything over it.6 Not only did robes of judges during the fifteenth century assume the general shape which they have possessed ever since , but scarlet became the almost universally adopted colour for their full dress during the second half of Henry VI 's reign , displacing green in favour. ? Sir Thomas Littleton ( d. 1481 ) appeared in scarlet in the now lost windows in the chapel of St. Leonard , Frankley , Worcs. and in Halesowen Church , Worcs. , as the portrait by C. Janssen at the Inner Temple , London , a picture founded on the portrait in these windows , proves . The adoption of this royal colour at last gave the dress of judges a necessary uniformity . A stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gives us much information about the dress of // judges at this period ( Pl. toB ) . Three judges , one of them William Haward , Chief Justice of England , the other two being ordinary judges , all wearing coifs , kneel on green cushions . They all wear a closed scarlet supertunica , edged and probably lined with miniver , and with blue facings down the front . They all wear a scarlet shoulder piece ' with a roller ' miniver hood , the shoulder piece ' being edged with miniver at the bottom . Alone of the three the chief justice wears an armelausa , scarlet and furred with miniver . ' But the finest piece of evidence which we possess for fifteenth-century English legal dress is to be found in the four splendid illuminations on the four surviving folios of a law treatise executed during the last years of Henry VI 's reign . Originally at Whaddon Hall , Bucks. , these folios came into the possession of the Inner Temple in 1894 . The four illuminations depict the Courts of Chancery ( Pl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Common Pleas , and the Exchequer ( frontispiece ) . In the first , two judges in scarlet sleeveless tabards lined and trimmed with miniver have scarlet shoulder pieces ' and miniver roller ' hoods . One of them , bare-headed and tonsured , is perhaps the Master of the Rolls , while the other , who wears a brown pileus , is the chancellor . On each side of the Master of the Rolls and the chancellor are two Masters in Chancery , both of whom wear a mustard-coloured sleeved supertunica.2 The illumination of the Court of the King 's Bench shows five presiding judges , all of whom wear a coif and a closed scarlet supertunica with fairly narrow sleeves trimmed and lined with miniver , a miniver roller ' hood , // and a shoulder piece ' . Over this appears the armelausa . ' The judges of the Court of Common Pleas wear the same dress as those of the King 's Bench.2 In the illumination of the Court of the Exchequer ' ( frontispiece ) the Lord High Treasurer presides in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bench , with this exception , that he wears a large scarlet turban ' head-dress . This head-dress was simply a lay fashion , and was worn in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries generally throughout Europe by any persons of importance to suggest dignity , just as in later times a full-bottomed wig was used . It was in fact a form of large bourrelet worn on the head , and was originally a Venetian mode . The turban ' fashion did not last beyond the fifteenth century.4 In this last of the Whaddon illumina-tions ( Frontispiece ) , the dress of the four Barons of the Ex-chequer , who sit with the Lord High Treasurer , consists of a mustard-coloured supertunica and armelausa , and a mustard-coloured turban ' . Two of them hold their tur-bans ' in their hands . To summarize the dress of judges in the fifteenth century , we find that chief and presiding judges wore a scarlet sleeveless tabard or sleeved supertunica , with an armelausa on the most solemn occasions , and a hood and shoulder piece ' , all these garments being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of course only be seen when the sleeveless tabard is worn ) was worn a subtunica , scarlet also . Inferior judges or other secondary judicial // officers wore dress of a mustard colour consisting of the same component parts as that which constituted the dress of the superior judges except that the supertunica was always worn , but the sleeveless tabard never . As to head-dress , one may generalize by saying that all actual judges had by the middle of the fifteenth century taken to coif and skull-cap , ' but other officers of the Crown not specifically judges wore such lay fashions as the turban ' head-dress . Thus by the close of this century nearly all the characteristics of the judge 's dress of today had come into being . It seems probable that the slit edged with fur on the front of a judge 's robe of today was introduced in the third quarter of the fifteenth century . It is not , as many have supposed , derived from the cappa clausa , for judges did not wear this form of outer garment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we study the brass of Sir Richard Byngham , Justice of the King 's Bench ( 1476 ) , at Middleton , Warwicks . His supertunica , which he wears under an armelausa , has a partial opening down the front , and it is this which is perpetuated in the slit on the breast of the present-day robe.2 In the sixteenth century the features of the dress re-mained the same as in the previous century3 except in two particulars , the first being the development of the hood to a great size , and the second the introduction of the pileus quadratus which was worn over skull-cap and coif.4 This large miniver hood was still joined to the scarlet cloth shoulder piece ' as the roller ' hood with its small flat liripipe had been . It now depended behind like a great // bag of miniver , and the scarlet liripipe , increased in breadth and length , hung down from it . It also increased in size in front during the century , keeping pace with the development of the academical hood which also descended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position at the front appears in a brass of 1563.1 About 1529 the black cornered cap ( pileus quadra-tus ) appeared , for it is worn by Rudhall on the tomb referred to on p. 54 , n. 3.2 This is the first example of it . It was limp and was made of either cloth or velvet.3 Two water-colours in the album of Lucas de Heere ( ? I575 ) provide good full-length figures of judges wearing this dress together with a stole hanging over both shoulders. ? It was about a quarter of a century before its use became generally accepted by judges . It is worn over skull-cap and coif by judge Sir Robert Brudenell ( d. 1531 ) on his tomb at Deene , Northants. , but as late as 1555 Lord Chief Justice Bromley wears the original round pileus with the addition of Tudor side-flaps on his coloured alabaster effigy at Wroxeter , Salop . Another example of the pileus quadratus , the squareness of it in this case being more pronounced than earlier , is to be seen in the stone effigy ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1554 ) at St. Michael 's , Southampton.s It is towards the end of the sixteenth century that we see an undress for judges for less important occasions developing . For this the cumbrous hood , now grown so large , was left off , and with a simple gown was worn what // became known as the casting hood ' . This had its origin in the fifteenth-century fashion of wearing the hat fastened to a scarf ( chaperon ) , by which it could be cast off the head to rest on the shoulder . Thus this scarf , wrongly called hood ' , was given the name of casting hood ' . ' The first example of the use of the casting hood ' , which is worn on the right shoulder , is to be found in the brass of the common law judge , Sir Anthony Fitzherbert ( 1538 ) , at Norbury , Derbys . ( Pl. 13a ) , and it is also worn by Sir William Coke , also a Justice of the Common Pleas ( 1553 ) , at Milton , Cambs.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serjeants since the fourteenth century , 3 began now to be generally carried.4 , The Collar of SS was a gold chain formed by a series of the letter S linked together with Garter knots between the S 's , and in the middle a rose with a portcullis on each side . There has been much controversy about its origin and significance . Whatever meaning the S may have had , whether representing Souvenez for the motto , popular in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , Souvenez-vous de Moy , whether it stood for Seneschallus ( Steward ) , an office held by John of Gaunt , or whether for Sanctus , being regarded as a religious ornament , there seems little doubt that it came to be a device of the House of Lancaster and was worn as a sign of the king 's favour . ' Henry VI re-garded it as a family badge and allowed his particular supporters to wear it , in view of which it seems probable that chief justices came to be allowed to use it because // of their being regarded as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted the Yorkist collar of roses and suns , but the SS collar of Lancaster was revived by Henry VII.z f'It is uncertain how soon the chiefs of the courts were distinguished by the collar , but there is no fifteenth-century example of its being worn by a judg ' ' Although it is shown as worn by Sir William Yelverton , Justice of the King 's Bench , in his brass at Rougham , Norfolk ( ? 1472 ) , it is worn in virtue of his military capacity and not his legal one . His figure in the brass is semi-military.4 The first pictorial example which there is of its being worn by a man of law as such ( for Sir Thomas More in his much copied portrait by Holbein ( 1527 ) wore it as a mark of the personal favour of Henry VIII since he had not at that date a high office ) 5 is the stone effigy of Sir Richard Lyster ( Lord Chief Justice , d. 1554 ) at Southampton , 6 and this was not set up until 1567 . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expressly stated that the chief justices and the chief baron wore the SS collar , as if it were a recent introduction. ? The wearing of the collar came to be confined to the Lord Chief Justice , the chief baron , the serjeant-trumpeter , and all officers of the College of Arms except pursuivants.8 From the reign of Elizabeth onwards it was worn by // these officials in an unchanging design , with the Garter knot between each of the letters S , except during the Commonwealth when Cromwell 's chief justice John Glynne wore roses in place of the Garter knots between the letters . ' From what Sir William Dugdalez says , and from his references to the collar 's use abroad , it seems that it was used on the Continent as a badge of honour . As has been said , the dress of judges , which during the sixteenth century came to be regarded as the full habit , remained virtually unchanged . It consisted of armelausa ( mantle ) , 3 supertunica , coif and skull-cap , with the pileus quadratus gradually finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bench ( d. 1545 ) , on his brass ( Pl. 13b ) at Narborough , Norfolk , is thus depicted , but has no pileus.4 It is worth noticing that the coif d'honneur , a white cap of point lace worn by a few judges and others of standing during Elizabeth 's reign , ' was adopted from a French lay fashion and had no significance as an article of legal dress . The armelausa was still worn open on the right side and closed on the left in 1592 , as exemplified by the anonymous portrait of that year of Sir Edmund Anderson , a puisne judge , which is in the possession of the Inner Temple. ? But a change occurred between this date and 1605 , for in W. Faithorne 's print after a portrait of Sir Edmund as Lord Chief justice of 1605 , the year of his death , it appears that the mantle has come to be open in front instead of at the side. ? // By the first years of the seventeenth century the undress of judges consisting of supertunica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood ' had not been entirely regulated to uniformity , although the usual colours for the supertunica and shoulder piece ' were either black or violet , and with this dress a black pileus quadratus ( cornered cap ) , a black skull-cap and a coif were worn . ' Two excellent portraits provide us with details as to the full dress of judges at this time , those of Sir Edward Coke , Chief Justice of the Common Pleas ( 1606 ) and Chief Justice of the King 's Bench ( 1613 ) at the Inner Temple , and of Sir John Doddridge , Judge of the King 's Bench ( 1612-28 ) , in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries.2 Taking these two portraits together we find that the full dress consisted of ( a ) as head-dress , a white coif with the flaps hanging a little way down at the sides , over this a black skull-cap , sometimes small and tight , sometimes looser and larger and lined with scarlet , and over this a limp black cornered ' cap ( pileus quad-ratus ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Doddridge 's portrait ; , ( b ) a large miniver mantle falling far behind and with an opening in front ; ( c ) a scarlet robe , a development of the original supertunica , covering the feet and having a slit in front on the chest edged with miniver , with fairly close-fitting sleeves , 6o GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND the cuffs of which were turned back some way fully to display the miniver lining ; ' ( d ) a scarlet shoulder piece ' lined and edged with miniver , over which was a full furred hood of miniver fastened in front in a V-shape ; and ( e ) as neck-wear , a ruff , which happened to be the lay fashion of the day . The robe was usually girded with a silk cincture , at first simply knotted in front , but by the time of Charles I tied in a bow . The use of a different lining for the dress for summer and winter seems still to have been observed . Gloves continued to be an article of dress.2 Such was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1635 published its authoritative rules for the costume of judges and serjeants. ( b ) The Dress of judges from 1635 In 1635 in pursuance of a Discourse on Robes and Apparel of ten years previously , a solemn decree was made by all the judges of the courts at Westminster.4 On this is founded all subsequent dress of judges . The results of this decree were as follows . Judges during Term in the courts at Westminster were to wear black or violet gowns as they prefer ' together with a hood of the same colour , and a mantle above the hood so that the end of the hood hung down from under the mantle behind . Their head-dress was to consist of a lawn coif , a GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND 6i velvet skull-cap , and above these a cornered cap . From Ascension Day until the Feast of St. Simon and St. Jude ( 28 October ) they were to wear their garments faced with changeable ' ( i.e. shot ) taffeta , but during the other half of the year with facings of miniver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the time of the visit of the lord mayor to Westminster to take his oath , on the fifth of November unless it fell on a Sunday , and at St. Paul 's or any other church on a Sunday in Term they were also to wear scarlet robes with velvet and satin stoles for the two chief justices and the chief baron , and taffeta ones for other judges . On these last occasions they were to wear scarlet casting hoods on the right side above the stole and pinned to the left shoulder . The two chief justices and the chief baron were to wear the Collar of SS on Ascension Day or any other grand day , on the day when the lord mayor took the oath at Westminster , on the fifth of November , on Midsummer Day , All-Hallow 's Day , and Candlemas . At a Privy Council or in the House of Lords in the afternoon in Term , judges were ordered to wear violet or black robes faced with miniver or taffeta according to the season , stoles , and scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robes were to be of scarlet if worn on a Sunday or holy day . On circuit judges going to church in the morning were to wear scarlet robes , hoods , and mantles , and to sit in their black cornered caps , but in the afternoons to wear scarlet robes with stole and scarlet hood and again to sit in cornered caps . Otherwise the Judge of the Assize was to wear in court a scarlet robe , hood , and mantle with coif and cornered cap ; the nisi Arius judge , i.e. a Judge of Assize hearing civil cases , on the other hand , was to wear only the scarlet robe with a stole and casting hood , but full hood and mantle were allowed // in case of cold . For public feasts they were to have scarlet robes , stoles , and scarlet hoods , the last worn above the stole and fastened on the right side as signifying temporal dignity , for if worn on the left it was a priestly symbol . A similar dress to this was to be worn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to wear a coat of broad-cloth , sleeved , and faced with velvet , the whole thickly laced , a Jacobean innovation . Scarlet was also to be worn on the first Sunday of every Term , when dining with the lord mayor or the sheriffs , in St. Paul 's , and at a Reader 's Feast if it were held on a Sunday or a holy day . On ordinary occasions the dress was to be a violet robe and a scarlet casting hood . Nisi Sirius judges in Westminster and London were to wear violet robes and scarlet casting hoods and stoles , except on holy days when scarlet was to be worn . ' A Summary of the Articles of Dress of judges from 1635 to the end of the eighteenth Century Robe . This was a closed supertunica with fairly close sleeves . A particularly good example showing the shape of the robe is the monumental effigy on the tomb of Lord Chief Justice Holt ( d. 1710 ) at Redgrave , Surrey.z Two kinds were allowed , one scarlet and the other black or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red letter days ( i.e. saints ' days ) , the monarch 's birthday , when trying criminal cases , when attending church , in the monarch 's presence , when dining with the sheriff , on the visit of the lord mayor to Westminster , and on the fifth of November , unless falling on a Sunday . Scarlet was // also worn at nisi Arius on circuit , but this was given up in the eighteenth century when a plain black silk robe , already worn by Chancery judges , was substituted . Under the Commonwealth a petition against the use of scarlet by judges came to nothing . ' The black or violet robe was to be used on all other occasions . Both colours of robe were worn trimmed round the neck , down the front , and on the cuffs , in winter with miniver , and in summer with taffeta , called variously sad-coloured silk ' , changeable taffeta ' , slate ' , or shot bronze ' . The change from fur to taffeta was to be made on Ascension Day , and taffeta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Day ( 28 October ) .2 Stole . This was black and , like a clerical stole , hung down suspended from the neck . The two ends of it were serrated . The stole was usually worn only with the casting hood , and was of satin or velvet for a chief justice and of taffeta for a puisne ( i.e. junior ) judge.3 In the Westminster Decree it is termed tippet ' which is the right use of the word . Hood . The hoods were of three kinds . The first , for the Westminster court , was to be violet or black to match the gown . The second for full dress consisted of the familiar full scarlet cloth shoulder piece ' lined and edged with miniver with the hood attached to it falling behind like a great bag of fur . From this hung a broad scarlet liri-pipe . By 1635 the hood itself had so increased in size that it came over the shoulder piece ' in front and descended on to the chest in a V-shape , being held in position there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // that hood and shoulder piece ' became separate . ' They were certainly separate in 1674 , the date of the oil-painting of Sir Richard Rainsford at Lincoln 's Inn , London . The third hood was the casting hood , whose origin has already been explained . In 1635 it was ordered that it should be worn on the right side and pinned towards the left shoulder , with its tail hanging loosely down in front , or tucked into the cincture . It was scarlet and was to be worn in place of a hood with undress black or violet . It lay over the stole in token of the fact that a judge was of temporal dignity only.2 The cincture . This was of some black material such as silk or taffeta and was worn with both full-dress and undress . ' The mantle . This changed form of armelausa , which ap-peared at the very beginning of the seventeenth century , was a cloak of scarlet cloth and miniver , worn hooked round the neck , open in front , with all the miniver showing behind.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the opening of the Commission at assizes , at church on Sunday mornings on circuit , when trying criminal cases , or at nisi Sirius on circuit if cold . In later times its use was more and more restricted . ' The head-dress . This consisted of the white lawn coif , and over that the black skull-cap which they began to wear in the fifteenth century , and over that , from the // middle of the sixteenth century , a limp black cornered cap . The first two of these were always worn ; the cornered cap , according to the resolution of 1635 , which made its use instead of the round one , occasionally used until then , obligatory , was to be worn in divisional courts , in church on Sunday mornings on circuit , at the opening of the Commission , and when trying criminal cases . ' Sir Robert Heath , Lord Chief Justice of the King 's Bench in 1642 , in his portrait wears a broad cornered cap with the skull-cap joined to it , and a coif which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was fast be-coming a mere covering for the upper part of the head , which character it had assumed by the time of the coming of the wig.2 With the introduction of wigs after the Restoration the coif and skull-cap became gradually smaller , 3 until they were no more than a circular patch of black silk surrounded by a circular edging of white frilled muslin fixed to the top of the wig ; but when judges , unlike serjeants , gave up the patch , a depression was left in the crown of their wig where the patch had been.4 Only one example of an eighteenth-century judge wearing a large black skull-cap on his wig appears to exists Neck-wear . This was worn by judges according to the // lay fashion of the time from small white turn-down collars and ruffs to point lace bands , ' until in the middle of the seventeenth century plain formal white bands came to be the invariable neck-wear of all judges , serjeants , barristers , attorneys , students , as well as of clerical and academical persons.2 Baron Finch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleas in 1635 , was the first man of law to wear bands as we now know them.3 In the eighteenth century , as a result of lay fashion , a lace fall was often used with their full dress by judges in place of bands.4 The Collar of SS has already been discussed . These collars were worn at the coronations of Charles II and James II not only by those who had used them since 1594,5 but also by Barons of the Exchequer and Justices of the King 's Bench and Common Pleas. ? The wig . The periwig was introduced into the court of Charles II from France in 1663,7 and soon everyone with any pretensions to position and fashion was wearing one , although the older and more serious generally held aloof from it for another decade and more . Albemarle and Clarendon , for instance , wore their own hair till the end of their lives . The new mode soon invaded the law courts , but older judges such as Sir Matthew Hale ( 16og ? 1676 ) and Sir Thomas Street ( 1626 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmounted by a black velvet skull-cap.8 Those who wore wigs gave up the skull-cap . Nearly all judges of the next generation took to // natural-coloured wigs . We see Lord Chief Justice Holt ( 1642 ? 1710 ) in his portrait by R. van Bleeck wearing a large black one , and holding his black cornered cap in his hand . ' Indeed by the end of the seventeenth century the largeness of wigs brought about the practice of nearly always carrying the square cap.2 The introduction in 1705 of white and grey powdered wigs covered with pomade and meal gradually became more popular , although natural colours continued to be worn in fashionable circles until about 1720 , and outside such circles later still . Judges , whose wigs as yet had no particular official significance , simply fell in with the fashion of the time , but when after 1720 the fashion began for smaller wigs , 3 they kept to the large wigs which they realized were so important to their dignity.4 During the next quarter of the century a white or grey wig , derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown and with a lappet falling forward over either shoulder , began to be recognized as a distinctive head-covering peculiar to judges and serjeants . Yet as late as 1758 some judges such as Sir Edward Clive wore a black wig of the ordinary lay style of William III 's time , as can be seen from Hogarth 's print , The Bench.s The white full-bottomed wig with puffed-up lappets falling forward over each shoulder is worn by Lord Mansfield ( Lord Chief Justice , 1756 ) in his portrait by Reynolds . Thus the judge 's wig became between 1720 and 176o a particular badge of office as a result of judges continuing to affect a lay fashion which had passed out of general use . But while judges had taken to this 1720 wig , they // were not uninfluenced by the fashion for smaller wigs which followed ; for when about 1 770 many took to wearing smaller wigs for ordinary occasions in court instead of the cumbrous full-bottomed wig , they adopted the then latest fashion of a short wig with one vertical curl at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the origin of the undress wig . Mourning . By the beginning of the eighteenth century a well defined system for legal mourning-dress had grown up . The signs of mourning on the dress of judges were that the stole , girdle , and the edges of the hood were covered with crape , the cuffs were covered with white lawn cuff-covers called weepers ' , and a double pleat ran down the middle of each tongue of the bands.2 Weepers ' were not confined to members of the legal profession as can be seen from Hogarth 's print , A Rake 's Progress ( Pl. vi ) . In this there is a man clutching his hat over his eyes , who wears a black mourning suit with white weepers ' on the cuffs , and he has very long thin white bands . The date of this print is 1735.3 ( c ) The Lord Chancellor The robe of the Lord Chancellor of black silk with gold braid on the facings and gold braid and gold tassels on the winged sleeves dates from the late sixteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those of outstand-ing dignity . It was exactly the same as the robes of the Oxford and Cambridge chancellors except that the robes of the two academical chancellors had a gold rosette on each sleeve and in the centre of the train , if a train were used.4 Viscount Brackley ( 1540 ? ? 1617 ) , Lord ChanGREAT // cellor 1610  --  17 , wears this robe in his portrait by S. de Passe , ' and examples of it at other periods are provided by the portraits in the possession of the Inner Temple of Lord Chancellor Heneage Finch ( L.C. , 1673 ? 82 ) and of Lord Chancellor Harcourt ( L.C. , 1713 ? 14 ) .2 All these robes are decorated with gold braid and gold tassels , but Lord Chancellor Macclesfield ( L.C. , 1718 ? 25 ) in the oil-painting by B. Ferrers3 which depicts him presiding at the Court of Chancery , has his robe decorated with plain black braid.4 Originally the gold braided robe seems to have been worn by privy councillors , and was also worn by Lords Justices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Chancellor ( 1672 ? 3 ) the Earl of Shaftesbury wore a robe of his own invention , ash-coloured and silver-laced.b The head-dress of the Lord Chancellor was , like that of the Speaker of the House of Commons , an ordinary hat according to the fashion of the period , round until the end of the seventeenth century and afterwards three-cornered. ? The Master of the Rolls wore the same dress as the Lord Chancellor , 8 unless he appeared unofficially , as does Richard Pepper Arden in K. A. Nickel 's picture of the House of Commons sitting in 1793 . Here as a M.P . he wears the black silk gown of a king 's counsel.9 // ( d ) Serjeants-at-Law The rank of serjeant-at-law ( Serviens ad Legem ) is of great antiquity . ' The position of serjeants in the hierarchy of the law was this , that they stood on the one hand with judges as brothers of the Coif , which head-dress they wore in common ; while below them was the Junior Bar , members of which assisted serjeants in court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the wearers of the Coif ( judges and serjeants ) and the rest who were without it . The rank of serjeant was a degree ranking immediately after the degree of Doctor of Law , while a judgeship was rather an office held by a member of the Order of the Coif . When during the Middle Ages judges took to wearing a skull-cap over the coif , while the serjeants wore the coif alone , this was because judges were regarded as theoretical Doctors of Law , the latter having long been allowed to dispute while wearing the pileus.2 From the senior serjeants , as the King 's Serjeants were , were chosen the judges . ' Serjeants in ancient times alone had the right of audience in the Court of Common Pleas , but later they were allowed to call in apprentices-at-law ( Apprenticii ad Legem ) to aid them ? apprentices were first ordered to follow the courts and learn by atten-dance in 12924 ? with the result that in the end these barristers , as apprentices later came to be called , under-mined the monopoly once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ' The Order of Serjeants was abolished in 1877.6 As soon as the apprentices had as // an order gained prestige , from among them were chosen the serjeants , the new serjeant being rung by the tolling of a bell out of his old Inn and into Serjeants ' Inn . ' The coif . It was the coif ( calyptra ; caleptra ) that came to be the outstanding badge of the serjeant , particularly so when judges in the fifteenth century began to wear a black skull-cap over their coif , partly hiding it , while serjeants continued to wear their white coif alone . The coif was a sign of graduation and was never removed by judges and serjeants even in the royal presence.2 The coif is supposed to have been derived from the loose white piece of linen or lawn used by Knights Temp-lars as a sweating cap , and it is not so extraordinary as at first sight may appear that a legal head-dress may have had such an origin when it is remembered that there was a close connexion between the initiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would seem to give the coif a purely utilitarian origin , the coif used by Templars by the twelfth century for a purely mundane purpose had originally been identified with a distinctly religious article , the pileus lineus or infula , an ecclesiastical head-dress , 4 and probably in popular esti-mation this and the calyptra became merged . Although such an origin is interesting , we simply have no positive evidence to support what in default of it must be accounted no more than tentative . The whole question of the connexion between serjeants and Templars is very difficult , and little is known about it . The coif became in the early Middle Ages the head-dress of men of dignity and even of the king 's servants , 5 // and it is as the head-dress of men of standing and of personae gratae at the king 's court that the serjeants came to wear it , even if they did not do so originally . Much that has been written about the coif of members of the order are mere afterthoughts . ' Although the original coif was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly become by the thirteenth cen-tury a tight head-covering made of white silk or linen , tied under the chin : Tegmen capitis , quod caput totum ambiebat. ' z The use of the coif by men of law is mentioned in Langland 's Richard the Redeless ( 1399 ) .3 After the fifteenth century the coif was no longer tied under the chin , ? and the ends hung loosely down at the sides . During the sixteenth century they gradually became shorter , and about the beginning of the seventeenth century vanished altogether . The next step of the development of the coif was reached in the later seventeenth century when the intro-duction of large wigs led to its further diminution . It has // been generally stated that the black patch with a frilled white edging , which at this time was placed upon the wigs of serjeants , was an innovation of the wig-makers to preserve the coif in rudimentary form . This is true , but it is not true to say that these wig-makers on their own initiative placed the black patch mistakenly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion for white wigs had been adopted by them . Writers of this opinion tell us that the wig-makers in their desire to preserve some distinguishing mark for serjeants , realizing that the white edging was now lost in the general whiteness of the wig , unwarrantably gave serjeants the black patch , which , as it represented the skull-cap of judges , should never have been given them . ' The truth is that as early as about 1585 serjeants when acting as the chief officer of a court had sometimes worn the black skull-cap of judges , as can be seen from the picture the Session of the Court of Wards and Liveries in the collection of the Duke of Richmond and Gordon at Goodwood ( P1. 14 ) , in which the Queen 's Serjeant , standing behind on the left with a paper in his hand , wears one over his coif . It has been suggested that his coif was covered because he was pleading no cause.2 By the end of the seventeenth century this wearing of the skull-cap over the coif by serjeants seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who appear in a print of James II 's coronation procession ( 1685 ) , 3 and also from the portrait of Sir Henry Chauncy ( created serjeant , 1688 ) which appears as the frontispiece to his The Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire ( 1700 ) . Here Chauncy wears over his natural-coloured wig a medium-sized coif and black skull-cap. // The robes . The earliest illustration of the dress of a serjeant appears to be that which is to be seen in an initial letter in a law treatise of the time of Edward I ( d. 1307 ) , Ralph of Hengham 's Magna Summa . The serjeant wears a plain tunica and a coif . ' By the middle of the fourteenth century their dress had become much more elaborate , and consisted of a sleeve-less tabard , or a full-length supertunica with either small bell sleeves or narrow sleeves.2 They were not allowed the armelausa , but had shoulder pieces ' and hoods , which might be lined with lamb 's wool like their other dress , but not with miniver as was the dress of judges.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle Ages is that of Sir John Fortescue who wrote in his De Laudibus Legum Angliae ( middle of the fifteenth century ) : He is clothed in a long robe , not unlike the sacerdotal habit ( roba longa ad instar sacerdotis ) , with a furred cape ( cum capiciopenulato ) about his shoulders , and a hood over it , with two labels or tippets ( et desuper collobio cum duobus labellulis ) , such as the Doctors of Law use in some Universities , with a coif. ' 4 In Piers Plowman the various items of the dress of serjeants are mentioned : Shal no seriaunt for here seruyse. were a silke howue ( coif ) , Ne no pelure in his cloke . for pledyng atte barre.5 The robe was girded at the waist . Attached to the shoulder piece ' was a roll of fur round the neck with a flat hood falling some way behind.6 But it was to be the parti-coloured dress , the medley ' , or striped robes spoken of by Chaucer that were to be // the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay fashion of the fourteenth century which men of law wore as a livery , as has been noticed already . ' After the ordinary fashion for these colours had passed , ser-jeants continued to wear this parti-coloured dress as retainers of the crown , varying the colours according to the sovereign they served , as did medieval city corpora-tions and retainers of royal and noble households.2 When during the fifteenth century judges began to wear exclusively dress of one colour this parti-coloured dress came to be entirely identified with serjeants.3 It seems also that not only the king but nobles presented serjeants with parti-coloured livery dress together with their retaining fees , for the Act of 1469 , in which Edward IV tried to control ( as had been attempted for nearly a century ) the private granting of liveries , mentions that no person of any condition was to give any livery to , or retain any person other than his menial servant , officer , or man learned in the one law or the other.4 The parti-coloured dress of serjeants appears in the four illuminations from Whaddon Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancery scene ( Pl. i 1 ) three serjeants stand at the bar and all wear a trailing parti-coloured supertunica of blue and green or blue and brown or blue and grey with shoulder pieces ' to match and flat broad liripiped hoods of the same colours hanging down behind . Each parti-coloured supertunica is ver-tically striped , the divisions of the colours being // separated straight down the front or back . A coif completes their dress . ' In the Court of the King 's Bench ( P1. 12 ) 2 the serjeants appear in the same dress , this time in each case green and blue , while in the Court of Common Pleas , all wear a dress exactly the same except that each blue and green supertunica is striped with white . In the Court of Exchequer scene ( frontispiece ) 4 they wear the same dress as they wear in the Court of Chancery and the Court of the King 's Bench . Another example of the serjeant 's dress of this period is to be found in a stained glass window in Long Melford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eight serjeants created by Edward IV in 1464 . Pygot wears a coif tied under the chin , a supertunica , of which the sleeves only can be seen , and over that a sleeveless tabard of blue , yellow , and white vertical stripes , and a murrey shoulder piece ' with white fur at the bottom of it , and joined to it is a roller ' hood of white fur resting close to the neck . Presumably a flat murrey liripipe fell behind.s The same dress precisely is worn also by another serjeant , John Haugh , of the same date and in a window in the same church. ? From these examples it can be seen that during the fifteenth century serjeants more often than not wore over their supertunica a tabard , sleeved or sleeveless , of two colours , generally blue and green , together with a shoulder piece ' and hood attached , the whole costume being lined and dressed with one of the superior white furs . Labels , which will be dealt with separately , are very noticeable in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brass of Thomas Rolf ( d. 1440 ) at Gosfield , // Essex , and other similar examples are to be found in two other brasses of serjeants in the next century , that of William Bendlowes ( 1504 ) at Great Bardfield , Essex , and of John Brook ( d. 1522 ) at St. Mary Redcliffe , Bristol ( P1. 15a ) . ' The tabard was a closed gown , often with moderate sized bell sleeves and sometimes sleeveless , precisely the same as the academical tabard.2 In 1555 the parti-coloured dress of serjeants generally is described as violet in grain ' , brown-blue ' , and ' mus-tard and murrey ' , 3 and new serjeants wore murrey and russet in 1552.4 It was , however , no longer the only dress of serjeants . They already had scarlet robes like judges for the most important occasions , 5 and from the time of Henry VIII used a scarlet hood with their perse blewe ( i.e. brown-blue ) gownes ' at creation , al-though after that ceremony they wore once more the parti-coloured hoods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth-century manuscript which contains the Orders of Creations of Serjeants in the reign of Henry VIII and in 1577 , has some notable references to dress . On the way to the ceremony of their creation the prospective serjeants wore their perse blewe ' gowns ( supertunica ) while their servants carried their coifs and their scarlet hoods . The scarlet hood was carried by the servant upon both his arms with the liripipe resting on the right shoulder and the coif in the middle of the hood.6 The new serjeants then received the coif and scarlet hood from the judges. ? // At the feast which followed they wore this dress with the addition of a cap . ' On the following Monday they heard mass in their brown-blue2 gowns without the hood . ' After this day they put on their parti-coloured dress of murrey and blue with hoods to match , the old serjeants at this time also wearing such dress . The tabbert ' , here described as sleeveless , was put on over the tunica but under the hood.4 Finally they wore their brown-blue gowns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected everywhere towards the middle of the sixteenth century , and probably serjeants wished to change to a modern form of costume . Already in 1577 a violet gown was worn in place of a brown-blue one by serjeants after their first year ? at court in Term. ? Thus in the picture of about 1585 , Session of the Court of Wards and Liveries ( P1. 14 ) at Goodwood only the two youngest serjeants wear parti-coloured gowns.8 The use of this form of dress being by the end of the sixteenth century reduced among men of law to lately created serjeants , it was determined to preserve that . Thus a charge to the new serjeants delivered to them in 1595 by the Lord Chief Justice appeals to their pride in the dignity of what probably appeared to them as bizarre. ? Again in 1625 the use of the parti-coloured dress was upheld , and it was decided that on no account was the procession of new serjeants from Serjeants ' Inn to WestGREAT // minster to be discontinued , presumably so that their dress might be seen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of preserving ancient dresses of dignity . ' But the parti-coloured robe was coming to be regarded more and more as the robe worn only at the actual ceremony of creation and not during the first year , and when in 162o throughout the circuit Sir James White-locke , then a serjeant in his first year , although practising in a purple robe and scarlet hood , appeared on Sundays and holy days in his parti-coloured robe , he was criticized by the senior serjeants who said he should never wear the parti-coloured dress.2 During the sixteenth century when the use of the parti-coloured dress was becoming more and more confined to new serjeants , other robes for serjeants had come into being . These consisted of a scarlet robe for the most formal occasions , first mentioned in 1555,3 the purple gown and scarlet hood , used at any rate as early as 1577,4 and a black silk gown with false panel sleeves . The Westminster Memorial on Serjeants ' Dress of 1635 was as authoritative as its companion which dealt with the dress of judges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Coif until the latter part of the eighteenth century . For the first year after their creation serjeants were to wear parti-coloured gowns of black and murrey except on a Sunday or holy day when they were to have violet gowns and scarlet hoods.5 8o GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND A scarlet robe , which was the same as that of judges , closed , girded , and with a large shoulder piece ' to which was attached a small hood with a large broad liripipe , was worn by serjeants after the first year on grand nights , when they were invited to the Inns of Court , when they dined with the lord mayor and sheriffs of London , and on such occasions of State as coronations . In this dress they were distinguished from judges only by their wearing their hoods close and not displayed . On State occasions only they carried black limp cornered caps . ' They were also allowed a scarlet court jacket for use at levees and so on , but no more is heard of it.2 An open , flap-collared gown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood hanging across the right shoulder was the bar or circuit dress . But on scarlet days in Term , serjeants wore this type of gown of finer cloth with a purple instead of a scarlet hood drawn tight round the neck with the liripipe pendent at the back. , A black stuff gown open in front , with lace on facings , false sleeves , and the square flap collar , was worn as the church and dinner dress. ? There was in addition a travelling dress which was the same as the dinner dress except that it had full , hanging bell sleeves instead of false ones.s Another dress of serjeants was the black gown of wrought velvet worn in the earlier part of the seventeenth century by first-year serjeants on All Hallow 's Day in Middle GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND 8i Temple Hall ; ' but this is not mentioned later . The short parti-coloured tabard ( the sleeveless tabbert ' ) , worn over the long parti-coloured robe at the time of creation , was used as late as 1736 , the date of the last full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parti-coloured dress and of the hood worn with it had become murrey and mouse-colour , ' , but this had been changed to purple and murrey by 1700.4 Even as late as this , except on a Sunday or holy day , many first-year serjeants wore their parti-coloured dress on all occasions.s They seem , however , to have worn the black laced gown at church or when dining in Serjeants ' Inn.6 The history of serjeants in the eighteenth century7 is the story of the beginning of their decline . The last general call of serjeants took place in 1736 . Serjeant Wynne , who was then called ' , describes the ceremony in detail . The ancient serjeants wore their purple gowns , while the new serjeants in the first instance wore their barrister 's gowns with full-bottomed wigs . They were then presented with their coifs and had scarlet hoods pinned on their barristers ' gowns . They next donned parti-coloured robes with a tabard to match over them , and left off the scarlet hood . They carried black square caps , 8 as did all serjeants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his creation , a new serjeant wore his parti-coloured dress , which was laid aside for an ordinary silk gown immediately after the feast.9 // This is the last time the parti-coloured gown was ever worn . From this date the ancient customs began to fall away . First the great feasts were discontinued , in 1787 rings ceased to be given away in open court , ' and in 1799 an Act of Parliament enabled the Crown to create judges during vacation , and as no one could be created judge without having previously been a serjeant , such judges could first be called to be serjeants without any ceremony , simply taking the oaths in the Lord Chancellor 's presence . This really killed the ceremonial , and at a limited call of serjeants in i8o9 , parti-coloured robes were not worn.2 Labels . Sir John Fortescue3 says that labels were an article of dress peculiar to serjeants , but they were also worn by kings and by high officials throughout Europe before and after Fortescue 's time . The Latin of Fortescue , labelluli , is wrongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Amos , although4 rightly translating the word as labels ' , in order to give a modern reader an idea of what is meant , misleadingly adds or bands ' . Du Cange says that the word refers to all kinds of hanging decorations.s From various examples in illuminated manuscripts we can tell what Fortescue meant by labels ' . In the fifteenth century Froissart there are three examples of them , but they vary somewhat from one another . Thus in The Meeting of Charles VI of France and the Duke of Brittany at Tours ' 6 they are worn by the Grand // Chamberlain , and appear to be formed by the ends of the coif drawn down underneath the collar . In The Arrest of the Duke of Gloucester " they are worn by Richard II and appear as simple appendages of his collar ; while in plate XXIV the labels ' of white fur worn by Henry IV of England at his coronation are the tucked-down ends of his small hood . They also appear in the non-academical dress of a Doctor of Medicine of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hood but of the turned-back collar ; but in the same manuscript ' the two pieces of fur , which are the labels ' , are joined to the hood and seem to have been pulled down underneath the hood itself . Labels ' also appear in a Flemish manuscript of this period , 4 where , as worn by the figure in a long robe , they seem to be the bib-like projection in front of the hood . These labels ' , which are always two tongues of white fur or occasionally of silk , and are sometimes rounded at the bottom and turned outwards in a gourd-shape , thus appear to be either part of the hood or an extension of the collar of the supertunica.s Examples of them worn by serjeants are to be found in the Ellesmere manuscript of the Canterbury Tales ( fifteenth century ) in the illumination of a serjeant , where they appear as two short pieces of fur below the hood.6 They also appear in the brass of Thomas Rolf ( 1440 ) at Gosfield , Essex. ? From these examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hood proper , loose ends twisted round behind the bottom of the hood , and then drawn out from underneath to fall below . They were perhaps used to keep the hood tight round the head . In support of this theory is the fact that , although they usually seem to be formed only of white fur , yet sometimes their edges appear to be of the same coloured stuff as the outer part of the hood , the fur being the lining of the hood itself continued in the labels ' . The question of labels ' is dealt with in detail only because of Fortescue 's mentioning them as an important part of serjeants ' dress ; but the truth seems to be that he has exaggerated their particular association with them , for as we have seen they were originally worn by many other important persons . The significance of them for serjeants ' dress would perhaps be outstanding to Fortescue merely because at the time of his writing ( mid-fifteenth century ) the fashion , while discontinued by others , was still retained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period . It has also been suggested though without good reason , as can be imagined from the above description of them in illuminations , that they were the laces of the coif worn untied ; ' for if this were so , how could they have been of coloured stuff of the colour of the hood with the white fur lining turned outwards ? Bands , though having a superficial likeness to labels ' , were a development of the falling collar of seventeenth-century lay fashion . Wigs . On the acceptance of the everyday fashion of the wig by the legal profession in the later seventeenth century , serjeants , in common with other men of law , wore natural-coloured wigs then in fashion , and as has been noted above concerning the wigs of judges it was not until the period 172o ? 6o that a particular forensic wig // appeared for judges and serjeants . Then , however , ser-jeants in common with judges kept to large wigs which for both went through the same stages of development . A good example of a serjeant wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be found in Hogarth 's plate , Paul before Felix ( 1751 ) .1 In the oil-painting by R. Houston ( i 769 ) of Wilkes , Glynn , 2 and Horne Tooke , however , Serjeant Glynn wears a short wig with his gown . Whether this wig has any forensic significance it is difficult to say . ' ( e ) King 's ( Queen 's ) Counsel King 's counsel are supposed to have been created in the sixteenth century4 as assistants to the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General , ' but they did not come into any prominence until 16046 when they appear as barristers favoured by the king and court , gaining their position as often as not by means of flagrant corruption . They are not a separate order ? the title is merely an honorary one ? king 's counsel being selected as leaders of the Bar from the general barristers . Thus their origin was obscure and their status irregular and so it continued to be ; indeed it was not until the time of William IV that they ceased to be merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their connexion with the royal court8 it is not surprising that king 's counsel should adopt some rich and foppish form of Bar dress , and like gentlemen-commoners among commoners take to a silk instead of a stuff gown . This open black silk gown // was of the flap-collared , winged-sleeved variety affected generally by men of dignity in Elizabethan and Jacobean times . The theory that the origin of this silk gown is to be found in the legal mourning prescribed at the time of Queen Mary II 's death is without foundation ; for king 's counsel wore these black silk gowns from the time of their appearance at the court of James I. ' Their gowns were decorated with lines of black braid and black tufts on sleeves and skirt as we see from a plate which illus-trates J. Ogilby 's account of Charles II 's coronation.2 In the eighteenth century these tufts were given up and gimp was substituted as the decoration . Always ready to take advantage of a rich lay fashion , at the end of the seventeenth century king 's counsel began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown and full-bottomed wig remain their full dress to the present day . In Hogarth 's Modern Midnight Con-versation ( 1735 ) , 3 the legal personage seated at the table facing ( supposed to be a portrait of a notorious barrister named Ketelby , who in 1736 became a serjeant ) wears a full-bottomed wig , although he was then only a barrister . King 's counsel with the same presumption clung to the large wig in common with judges and serjeants when barristers had by 1730 ? 40 taken to the short white wig then appearing as a lay fashion . King 's counsel as a sign of mourning , public or private , wore white lawn or muslin cuffs on the sleeves of their black court-suits . As undress , from the latter part of the eighteenth century they wore bands instead of the lace cravat and a barrister 's wig.4 Attorneys-General and Solicitors-General wore the same gowns as king 's counsel , decorated at first with tufts and // afterwards with gimp , except that instead of being of plain silk they were of damasked silk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ashmolean Museum , Oxford , of John Cooke , Solicitor-General during the reign of Charles I. He wears a round bonnet , something like a tam-o ' - shanter . All king 's counsel , barristers , and generally attorneys wore a loose bonnet during the seventeenth century2 until the use of wigs put an end to a head-dress . Recorders as senior counsel wore the same dress as king 's counsel during the seventeenth century with the addition of velvet welts on their gowns like readers of Inns . Many of them had held this office.3 Later in the same century they took to a black silk gown decorated with gimp.4 ( f ) Barristers-at-Law In the Middle Ages two kinds of lawyer outside the Bar ' came into being , the Apprenticii ad legem and the Attornati . The apprentices were first ordered to follow the courts and learn by attendance in 1292,5 and later were called in by serjeants to aid them in their cases.6 They finally became known as utter barristers ( i.e. men outside the Bar ' ) . The Attornati were men of law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generales , prescribed infrequently by judges , and had their headquarters in the Inns of Chancery . The Apprenticii ad legem on being in the later Middle Ages admitted to the courts in their own right to the detriment in time of serjeants , became known as Apprenticii ad barros , and from these barristers were chosen the serjeants themselves. ? // There is no evidence that barristers had any particular dress in the earlier part of the Middle Ages . In a legal treatise of the time of Edward I ( d. 1307 ) , the Judicium Essoniorum , they simply wear a plain tunica.l No other illustrations of barristers occur until about 1460 , when there are two brasses . Apart from a large and tall velvet cap edged with fur their dress is simply a pleated tunica.2 This head-dress was not of any particular legal character , and it may be compared with such high hats as those worn by merchants and leading citizens . If this were all our evidence for the dress of barristers of this period we might conclude that there was nothing as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminations ( Pls. 11 and 12 ) are depicted bare-headed barristers , all of whom wear a belted parti-coloured tunica of blue and mustard or green and blue , rayed diagonally , and ankle-length , and having neither shoulder piece ' nor hood.3 This , as was the parti-coloured dress of serjeants , was a livery dress given to them by their noble clients with their retaining fee.4 The use by barristers of the parti-coloured dress did not , however , last beyond the Livery Act of 1469 , and by 1507 they had adopted the ordinary Tudor gown of lay fashion without sleeves which we see in the brasses of William Eyre ( 1507 ) at Great Cressingham , Norfolk , and of Robert Southwell ( 1514 ) at Barham , Suffolk . By the end of this century this gown had come to have short hollow glove-sleeves through which the arms passed . Stayner 's print of the now destroyed recumbent effigy // of Edmund Plowden ( 1587 ) which used to be against the north wall in Temple Church , London , shows this gown worn over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brass of Robert Trencreeke ( 1596 ) at St. Erme , Cornwall . ' These gowns of black stuff appear to have been worn by barristers as members of the Inns and in accordance with their rules , for there is no record of their being ordered to wear a special bar dress in court.2 In Eliza-bethan times both utter barristers and students wore stuff gowns and round caps as is recorded of the Middle Temple and Gray 's Inn.3 Two brasses of the seventeenth century show how the dress of barristers developed during this period . Thomas Palmer ( 1621 ) on his brass at Epping , Essex , wears a full gown worn closed . The arms appear through holes in the hollow glove sleeves which are knee-length , and there is a small gash near the bottom of each sleeve . The shoulders of the gown are raised by means of stuffing , and a large cape falls behind fastened from shoulder to shoulder. ? Thomas Shiers ( 1668 ) , whose brass is at Great Bookham , Surrey ( P1.15 b ) , is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen buttons running down the upper part of the front of the gown . The sleeves are glove sleeves and are rounded off at the bottom.5 During the Commonwealth barristers did not wear an official costume.6 In 1685 barristers temporally assumed black silk gowns in place of the black stuff ones as a mourning dress for the death of Charles II , but in 1697 they appear // to have returned again to the stuff gowns . ' On the intro-duction of the wig the round cap was abandoned.2 As to neck-wear , in the seventeenth century , until the Civil War barristers wore falling bands , about six arranged one upon the other . They had the appearance of ruffs rather than bands , and differed from the bands of clergy of that period in that they were not worn poked as the latter were.3 They took to bands as we now know them about the middle of the century . Thomas Shiers ( referred to above ) wears them . By the eighteenth century the gown had become what it now is , open , and of black cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule wore silk ones.4 The open gown had a yoke and bell sleeves , which were drawn up at the elbow by means of two buttons , joined by a horizontal piece of braid , and vertical cords.s On the lower left-hand corner of the yoke was a small black tippet in shape like a fiddle ' sliced in two length-wise , to which was attached a streamer which ran forward over the left shoulder and hung down in front. ? This was undoubtedly derived from the medieval fashion of the chaperon . " ' Whether it was revived in the eighteenth century or whether it had been worn before on the Tudor flap-collared gown and had survived the change to a yoked collar can not be said for certain , for there is no brass or other kind of example which shows the back of the barrister 's gown . Very likely it had always been // worn , for the eighteenth century , an era of innovation , was hardly the time for a revival of an old fashion . Until about 1730 ? 40 barristers wore full wigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , influenced by the change of fashion , they took to shorter wigs . By 1743 they were wearing a short white powdered wig with three queues.2 By 1750 as ordinary fashion moved on and single or double queues were assumed , barristers still kept to the triple queue which became associated with the Bar.3 These wigs had no side-curls , but when about 178o the fashion came into being of wearing a wig with two or three horizontal curls running right round the sides and back of the head , 4 barristers took to this , their three queues having been in the meantime reduced to two.5 ( g ) Attorneys-at-Law and Solicitors There is no evidence for the dress of this class of lawyer before 1585 , when in the picture of that year already mentioned , the Session of the Court of Wards and Liveries , an attorney sitting on the right , next but one to the presiding Lord Treasurer , wears a black gown over ordinary dress and a round black Tudor bonnet. ? The dress of an attorney of 163o was not much different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Ignoramus , Comoedia ( 163o ) . It consisted of a long open black gown , furred at its edges and on the cuffs of its close sleeves , and of a large round cloth bonnet , ample at the brim ( see p. 87 , n. 2 ) .7 // During the course of the century the gown became formalized as a false winged-sleeved , flap-collared one . As long as attorneys continued to frequent the Inns , which they did until the later seventeenth century , they wore this variety of stuff gown and bands . ' After that they seem to have been without a special dress.2 Solicitors as distinct from attorneys are first heard of in the fifteenth century . They were engaged in Chan-cery work , whereas attorneys were employed in common law . They thus held a position very inferior to that of attorneys , and when in the eighteenth century attorneys took over their work they virtually ceased to exist.3 They do not seem at any time to have had a special costume . ( h ) Dress at the Inns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students , were the most important officials at the Inns of Court . Robert Pynkeney , who was Reader of the Middle Temple for Lent , 1505 , left at the time of his death three years later a murrey gown lined with tawny damask and a long crimson gown lined with fur and faced with black velvet.4 We may take these two dresses as repre-senting his official dress for ordinary and special occasions . A sixteenth-century reader of Gray 's Inn , Richard Payton ( 1574 ) , wears on his brass at Isleham , Cambs. , an open gown lined with brinded fur and with a standing collar . It has false winged sleeves of knee-length , braided in sloping lines.s In 1558 the authorities of the four Inns of Court took in hand the regularization of dress . Lay dress was to conform to rule , and velvet caps , scarves , and winged // gowns were forbidden . ' In 1584 the benchers of the Middle Temple enacted that ruffs were not to be worn , that no white colour was to be used in doublet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their cloth gowns , that only sad coloured ' gowns and not cloaks were to be worn in the street , that no hats were to be worn , and that the hair of members was not to be long or curled . ' Gray 's Inn made similar strict rules as regards dress between 1573 and 1611 , and all members of the Society were to wear their gowns out of doors as the rule of 1600 demanded . ' Readers and benchers of the four Inns from the late sixteenth century wore a black gown decorated with velvet and silk tufts , 4 but at the end of the seventeenth century they began to wear silk gowns without velvet . ' Students of all Inns wore a plain , sleeveless black stuff gown with a flap collar6 and a round cloth cap ( like that of an Oxford servitor ) from Elizabethan times onwards . This was no doubt the cater-cap ' which was forced upon apprentices and others at this period . The wearing of a round cap by barristers also ( presumably of superior quality ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sixteenth century . ' In 178o students of the Middle Temple still wore a round cap in hall and at church in Term.8 Earlier in the century there had been great slackness among students about the wearing of their dress at Lincoln 's Inn , where in 1717 , it is said , // they were in the habit of coming into hall without gowns or with only fragments of gowns . ' , 2 ( i ) Doctors ' Commons Those practising in this court , which dealt particu-larly in Probate , Divorce , and Admiralty affairs , were called in the ecclesiastical courts advocates ( i.e. barristers ) or proctors ( i.e. attorneys ) . Only Oxford or Cambridge Doctors of Civil Law could be advocates.3 When serving in civil courts and in the Court of Arches advocates wore a scarlet robe with a scarlet cloth hood lined with scarlet taffeta and edged with miniver . In all ordinary ecclesiastical courts they wore the black gown of barristers . Proctors always appeared in the dress of attorneys.4 A judge of the High Court of Admiralty , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1584 ) in the Priory Church , Abergavenny , wears the undress winged-sleeved gown decorated with buttons and cords of his Oxford degree , that of Doctor of Civil Law . II . SCOTLAND The only hint we have during the whole of the Middle Ages of any distinct professional legal dress in Scotland is that given in an Act of the Scots Parliament of 1455 , which ordered that the Lords of Parliament , which was then the Supreme Court , should each wear a red open cloth cloak , lined with silk or furred with cristie gray griece or purray ' with a hood of the same cloth and simi-larly furred ; while the advocates were to have green gowns of the fashion of a tunikil ( i.e. a short tunica ) and the // sleeves to be open as a talbert ' ( i.e. tabard ) . ' This last dress would seem to be what in England would be called a sleeved tabard ' . Very likely the red cloaks of the Lords of Parliament were imitated from the dress of the Parliament of Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1514 , for instance , councillors , procureurs , and advocates of the king in the Paris Parlia-ment wore scarlet robes and round black bonnets , while presidents wore in addition a scarlet manteau , decorated on the upper part near the shoulders with three bars of gold lace . They wore a black velvet mortier decorated with gold lace instead of a bonnet.2 During the sixteenth century Scotland and France in their common feelings of hostility towards England drew closer together politically as well as culturally . It is known that when in 1536 James V visited France he was so im-pressed by the legal institutions which existed in Paris that under his orders an Act for setting up a Court of Session ( i.e. a Civil Court ) and a College of Justice ( i.e. a Criminal Court ) came into being . Certainly the Parliament of Paris was the model for the Scottish Supreme Court , but whether or not the legal dress of the Parliament , which at the time of the Scottish king 's visit consisted of red robes and velvet head-dress , was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a definite system of legal dress for Scotland was decided upon . In that year James VI induced the Scots Parliament to pass an Act for con-trolling the dress of legal personages , kirkmen , and others , 4 // from which it would seem that for a long time no parti-cular legal uniform had been recognized . ' A year after the Act had been passed the king issued by proclamation a set of rules for the kind of dress to be used by the various law officers . It is believed that the different costumes were invented by him . The Presi-dent of the Court of Session was to wear a purple cloth robe faced with crimson velvet and a hood lined with crimson velvet , while Ordinary Lords of Session were to wear the same except that they were to have satin instead of velvet ; 2 the four Extraordinary Lords of Session were to have black velvet , satin , or silk gowns lined with black of any material they pleased ; the justice General was to have a red-scarlet robe faced with white ermine ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same fur ; other justices were to wear a red-scarlet robe and hood ; and the justice-Depute and the justice-Clerk Principal were to wear black gowns faced with red-crimson satin and black hoods lined with similar satin . The dress of Advocates , Clerks of Session , Clerks of ( i.e. Writers to ) the Signet , and all other Clerks of courts was to be a black gown with a dark , or better , black lining of stuff or fur . ' The last enactment as regards Scottish legal robes appeared in 1672 . In that year by Act of Parliament the High Court of Justice was founded . According to that Act4 all judges were ordered to sit in red robes faced with white , that of the justice General to be lined with false ermine ' to distinguish him from all others . ' In 1675 it was found necessary to insist on Advocates // wearing their black gowns in court . ' An interesting fact to be noticed is that Procurators pleading in the Commissary Court of Glasgow wore red gowns until the later seven-teenth century.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , as can be seen for instance in the ink drawing The Funeral Procession of the Duke of Rothes , Lord High Chancellor of Scotland ' ( 1681 ) in the National Library of Scotland , Edinburgh ( Pl. 16 A ) . The dress worn in this picture is essentially the same as that prescribed by James VI in 1610 except that it is generally some-what more elaborate , but the gowns of Clerks of Session and Writers to the Signet differ , a distinction which the king had not intended . Thus the Clerks of Session have plain gowns with sleeves reaching to the elbow , but the Writers to the Signet have plain gowns without sleeves and simply a vertical slit at the side for the passage of the arms . Advocates in this picture have gowns with braiding and tassels , and frogged and slashed sleeves reaching to the elbow . The Lords of Session wear robes with three rows of ribbon in front and with voluminous sleeves , reaching to the wrists , and shoulder pieces ' over the robes . The Lord Register and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamented with braid and tassels , but they are not clear in the picture , nor is it easy to see what the Lord justice-Clerk is wearing . ' The portraits , however , of Sir John Dalrymple , first Earl of Stair , Lord Justice-Clerk ( 1648-1707 ) , and Lord Justice-Clerk Maxwell ( 1643 ? 1732 ) show clearly what it was . That of Stair ( about 1688 ) depicts him wearing // a red robe ( which was adopted for his office in 1672 ignoring the order of 1610 which required black faced with red-crimson ) , faced with white , and a white shoulder piece ' with red edgings , while that of Maxwell ( date of portrait , 1696 ? 1702 ) shows him wearing a scarlet robe with shoulder piece ' and white satin cuffs pierced with holes in many places . These holes appear to be scarlet by reason of the scarlet cloth under them . ' Holes arranged in squares appear in the shoulder piece ' and cuffs of the dress of Robert M'Queen of Braxfield , Lord Justice-Clerk , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Henry Dalrymple , wears in a print of him of that year a wig with lappets , and a closed robe with a short cape , large cuffs , and a cluster of loops of ribbon in the middle of the robe.3 Such loops of ribbon were originally bows used for fastening the robes by lacing . Indeed , in the portrait of Sir John Gilmour of Craigmillar ( d. 1671 ) , famous as the supporter of Montrose , the ribbons are actually used for this purpose.4 Portraits of the early and middle eighteenth century , at Parliament House , Edinburgh , show these ribbons as bunches , as in the portrait of Duncan Forbes ( President , 1737 ) where there is to be seen one continuous row of clusters on the shoulder piece ' . Andrew Pringle , Lord Alemore ( Lord of justiciary , 1759 ? 76 ) has six large bunches of ribbon on his shoulder piece ' , while by the time we reach Lord Kennet ( Lord of justiciary , 1769 ? 85 ) we find that the bunches have become rosettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portraits of Lord Justice-Clerk Rae ( 1725 ? 1804 ) and Sir William // Nairn ( 1731-1811 ) , Lord of Session . Judging by the dates of the portraits it seems that it was about 1775 that formalized rosettes were adopted instead of bunches of ribbon . ' These rosettes were plum-coloured as can be seen from the oil-painting of Robert Dundas the younger ( 1758 ? 1819 ) by Raeburn.2 Attached to all shoulder pieces ' was a short flat hood which fell behind.3 In the portrait of Dundas the hood is plum-coloured . The undress gown for all judges was of black brocade with a flap-collar and false winged sleeves , decorated on the sleeves with tufts , as can be seen from the oil-painting of Robert Dundas of Arniston ( Lord President of Session , 176o ? 87 ) , which is at Parliament House , Edinburgh ( Pl. 16 B ) .4 In 1793 , according to J. Kay 's engravings , both the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General wore a black gown with a black velvet flap-collar and glove sleeves reaching only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dress of advocates had come to be a long black gown with a black velvet collar , bell sleeves fastened half way up the arm , a short wig , and a black three-cornered hat. ? Coifs appear never to have been worn by Scottish men of law , and in Scotland there did not exist an order of serjeants to preserve this ancient head-dress of dignity . Sir Thomas Hope ( King 's Advocate , 1626 ? 4o ) in his portrait at Edinburgh wears a black velvet skull-cap ornamented with lace or fur , 7 but as can be seen from the
