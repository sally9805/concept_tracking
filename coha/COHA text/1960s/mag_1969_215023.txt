All over Cuba , posters proclaim TEN MILLION IN ' 70-a reminder that Fidel Castro is counting on an unprecedented harvest of 10 million tons of sugar next year . What makes that goal remarkable is that this year 's crop will probably total no more than 4,500,000 tons . Nonetheless , despite drought , shoddy Soviet machinery and Cuba 's inefficient armies of " volunteer " cane cutters , the Maximum Leader is confident of success . And why not ? To achieve his target , Fidel is stretching the calendar . <P> In pre-Castro days , the harvest period ran from January to March . As productivity has declined , the cane cutting has become more and more prolonged . Castro began his so-called 1970 harvest this July , and he plans to press on for almost a full year , even though he will have to cut immature cane-thus jeopardizing the 1971 crop-and throw as many as 1,000,000 of Cuba 's 8,200,000 people into the effort . <P> <P> Taking no chances that year-end frivolity will get in the way of his scheme . Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 anniversary of the revolution . Celebrations would only " interrupt the harvest , " he explained last week . So , he said : " We will save our suckling pig and Christmas Eve beans , Bacardi rum and beer for July . " What if the 1970 harvest falls short , as outside experts predict ? Who knows ? Perhaps in that case the Bearded One will hold off the other bearded one , Santa Claus , a while longer .
