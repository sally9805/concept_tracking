DICK The greatest . ( He exits . Silence . ) JANE ( very quiet ) : Bastard . ( Long pause . She shouts . ) You bastard ! DICK enters , crosses to Jane 's bed , leaving door ajar , so that for a while it remains the only source of illumination . DICK ( sits on edge of bed ) : I 'll be honest with you , I 'm not getting as much out of this as I expected . I expected , I do n't know , a lot more , I do n't know , a lot more , I ca n't put my finger on it , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not working out , it 's nobody 's fault , we 've had some laughs , what the hell , right ?

Her head sinks under the sheet.I thought you liked to talk afterwards . Is n't that one of your objections  --  that I 'm dressed and out of here before we 've had a chance to discuss how good it was ? All right , we 're talking . Except that 's not enough , is it ? If I give in to you on talking then the next request is to hold you . If I give in to you on holding the next request is to pet you . Except both of us pet you because you 're guiding my hand .

DICK Come on , you 're making me mad ! JANE I do n't trust you . DICK ( shouts ) : Do we have to fight when I 'm standing on my goddamn head ? I did n't think it was possible but you make me tense even this way ! JANE , with great awkwardness , tries a headstand .
