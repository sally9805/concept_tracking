" Is n't it time that the American university prepared a decent , respectable burial for the traditional American college fraternity ? They have served an historical purpose and served it well . But we 've given up banjo clubs and minstrels . Now it 's time to face courageously the task of replacing the alumni-dominated fraternal system .

Eddy Jr . of Pittsburgh 's Chatham College , before a meeting of U.S. state-university presidents in Washington , D.C. How to preserve small-unit living on big campuses is the problem , says Critic Eddy . The " three , four-and sometimes ten-story hotel which often serves as a dormitory " is no solution . But neither is preservation of fraternities : " Time has run out for the national fraternity system . It has failed to adapt itself to the demands of the new student and to a changing social pattern . The system can and should be replaced-not with more Hiltons or Statlers but with intellectual centers " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
