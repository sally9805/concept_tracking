The Chessman Cover <P> Sir : <P> While your March 21 Chessman cover is nauseating , congratulations on having the courage to print it . <P> <P> H. L. ZIMMERMAN <P> Mountain , Wis . <P> Sir : <P> " Shocked " can hardly express my feelings . <P> <P> AUDREY B. FOESTE Billings , Mont . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> Boo to you . <P> <P> GERTRUDE REBSTOCK <P> Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> It is a damn shame that horsewhipping of editors has gone out of style . <P> <P> LEO F. FOCHA Berkeley , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I must congratulate you on the completely dispassionate , logical , objective and impersonal manner in which you presented the facts in the Chessman dilemma . <P> <P> JOHN STRANACK New York City <P> Crime &; Punishment ( Contd . ) <P> Sir : <P> Re capital punishment : one 's own motivating forces and morals are the actuating or deterring factors . Even the question of incarceration does not preclude crime . Why should the death penalty , fading as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after apprehension is prison ? <P> <P> GLORIA D. HOUGHTON <P> Miami <P> Sir : <P> The arguments against capital punishment all seem concerned not with the prisoner but with the collective conscience of humanity . If these people were truly concerned with the prisoner , not with themselves , they would favor capital punishment because it is humanitarian . Life imprisonment is a form of barbaric torture , indeed a cruel and unusual punishment . <P> <P> STUART CAMPBELL <P> San Francisco <P> Sir : <P> The crime of murder is shocking in its impact on the public . So is the execution of the death penalty . Capital punishment also involves long periods of unhealthy sensationalism and emotionalism in trying a person for his life . It is something the public should not be required to endure just because there are still people who state that capital punishment is a deterrent , though they have no proof of it . <P> <P> PHILIP H. BUNKER Attorney at Law West Roxbury , Mass . <P> <P> Declaration of Independence <P> Sir : <P> Your Feb. 29 article on Larry Fleischman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once attempted to proclaim a republic in Greenwich Village from Washington Square Arch . It was a student of Sloan 's , one Gertrude Drick , termed " the <P> Golden Bird , " who instigated the revolution . Gertrude Drick ( who carried black-bordered cards engraved WOE , " because Woe is me " ) discovered a way to the Arch 's top , decided to stage a revolution , and invited Sloan , Marcel Duchamp and others . After an all-night revelry with lanterns , red balloons and liquor , climaxed by Woe reading her " Declaration of Independence , " they left the Arch with balloons still floating from the top . <P> Sloan did an etching of the revolution entitled Arch Conspirators . <P> <P> JACK THOMAS <P> Spokane , Wash . <P> The Meaning of Calvary <P> Sir : <P> I am not familiar with the script of the Oberammergau Passion play . Perhaps it does contain , or has contained , expressions of special blame and bitterness toward the Jews March 21J .
