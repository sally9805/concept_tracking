txt Lyndon Johnson wanted one thing of the world when he first became President : that it leave him alone . He thought he had neither the gift nor the experience in foreign affairs of John F. Kennedy . He was dragged into world conflict backwards , by events , against his inclination and his great concern with social progress at home . The last thing he wanted was a big war in Asia . This week , President Johnson had arrived at the full vigor of the four Presidents before him , in his concept and leadership of the United States 's new role in the world . His speech to the American Alumni Council set forth the wide range of policy he had inherited from them : determination at home , the defense of independence abroad , and the magnanimity that should build the sinews of peace for the future . In particular , he dropped the smaller arguments over the " legality " of his country 's role in Vietnam . He openly proclaimed the United States is a " Pacific power . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asia " arising out of that power . So saying , he faced his critics head on . Decision firmly made It is recalled here that none of his predecessors had provoked such widespread opposition as he has now . Their great tests of power with the Communist world were direct and clearcut by comparison , as at Berlin , Korea , and Cuba . Mr. Johnson , by contrast , four ' himself deep in the mire of civil insurrection in Vietnam , more political than it was military . Rightly or wrongly , he has nevertheless decided several times in the past year that this was another challenge by violence from the Communist system that the aims of the United States could not tolerate . Like Presidents Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor , Truman at Korea , Eisenhower at Quemoy and the Formosa Strait , and Kennedy , who sent the marines into Thailand when the Communist forces approached , he stiffened his hand each time . As the war grew in size and complexity , and in multiple frustrations abroad and at home , he was reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of simultaneous warmaking and peacemaking and waging politics at home , turning one way and another , like a politician playing it by car . No alternative seen As the expert community of foreign affairs specialists in Washington has watched the process , he worked himself back to the stern fundamentals of American postwar policy that he inherited . These are what he set down in this week 's speech . No one had offered him a workable alternative , in his judgment , to meet this new and obviously different Southeast Asian situation . The Johnson phrase  --  that the United States is a " Pacific power " with the responsibilities and obligations thereof  --  is his own . But the precedent recalled here was that of President Kennedy on his last trip to Germany , five months before he was killed , after the Cuban affair , the " thaw " had begun , when he was formulating his philosophy . He said : " For 18 years the United States has stood // *Johnson defines role of U. S. power in Pacific // its watch for freedom all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the effectiveness of American strength , have been shown in support of free government in Asia . in Africa . in the Americas , and , above all , here in Europe .... Toward ... real peace ' " As I have said before , and will say again , we work toward the day when there may be real peace between us and the Communists . We will not be second in that effort . But that day is not yet here . " This approach was begun with the combined wars in the Pacific and Europe after Pearl Harbor , and continued when the power of empires receded , after the war , when only the United States had global strength . It has been stated endless times since . Now President Johnson , apparently seeing no other way out of the new tangle in Vietnam , has restated the same tight mixture of American firmness and conciliation , the second to be based on the first . The President also used the " Pacific power " part of his speech to refute those who think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is isolation , he said . And it is meaningless in an age when men and missiles cross the Pacific as easily as the Atlantic . He accused his critics of thinking that Asians do n't matter , and he retorted that in common humanity , they do . It is yet to be seen , and perhaps to be decided in the jungles and election booths of Vietnam , whether the speech will rank , as the Washington Post said it did , as " the most powerful and persuasive declaration of his presidential career . a great state document .
