To the vast chagrin and surprise of South Viet Nam 's militant Buddhists , the government of Premier Nguyen Cao Ky last week wound up its first year in office in an anniversary waltz of energy and authority . For Ky and his generals to be around at all represented no mean accomplishment-the longest stretch of governmental stability since Diem fell in 1963 . <P> Ky 's tenure was hardly the fault of the bonzes , who for months have been trying every trick in the pagoda political manual to oust the government : massive protest demonstrations , immolations ( last week a 16-year-old girl became the tenth suicide by fire in the monks ' current campaign ) , blocking streets with household altars , burning U.S. Jeeps and other vehicles , and riots , riots everywhere . All have proved to no avail . <P> There were signs last week that it may eventually be the Buddhists who crack . Everything else having failed , Buddhist Ringleader Thich Tri Quang went on a hunger strike , by week 's end had lapsed into a near coma that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thich Tam Chau , spokesman of the Buddhist hierarchy 's moderate wing , publicly broke with Tri Quang and the militants . Tri Quang , said Tam Chau , has " no authority to promulgate any decisions " of the hierarchy , adding , " I am not for bringing Buddha into the streets . " And in a swift , virtually bloodless move in Hue , 3,000 of Ky 's troops took over the northern city , which the Buddhists and rebel Vietnamese soldiers have controlled for nearly four months . <P> At week 's end Ky demonstrated another brand of toughness , which was welcomed by the U.S. Roaring inflation had threatened to rip the fabric of South Vietnamese society : food prices had risen 85% in 18 months , overall prices as much as 130% . Announcing a basic overhaul of the economy , Ky devalued the piastre by nearly half , loosened import restrictions to create more price-cutting competition , raised the salaries of military and government workers from 20% to 30% . They are the people who have been hardest hit by the inflation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war and instituting pacification reforms .
