FUNERAL CUSTOMS THE WORLD OVER ( 973 pp. ) - Robert Habenstein and William Lamers-Bulfin Printers ( $12 ) . <P> <P> Man is a funereal animal . For reasons best known to his witch doctors ( sometimes also called head shrinkers ) he often shows less interest in the living than he does in the dead . In this ponderous but morbidly fascinating volume-a sequel to that unintentionally hilarious masterpiece of exequial scholarship , The History of American Funeral Directing ( TIME , Oct . <P> 24 , 1955 ) - Sociologist Robert Habenstein and Historian William Lamers have attempted to describe for U.S. readers how the other half dies . <P> In most parts of the world , the authors report , death gives warning of its approach . Boards creak , bushes rustle , dogs howl . In Poland , according to one old superstition , when a man discovers a white spot underneath the nail of the little finger , left hand , he knows he 's had it . When death is near , most societies require the presence of close relatives and a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pluck a hair of the dying man 's head so that the soul can escape through the root-hole . In Turkey , a hoca ( holy man ) wets the dying man 's throat with water-if a soul gets too thirsty as it climbs the hill of eternity , it will surely sell itself to the Devil for a cooling drink , In Yucatan , on the other hand , the Chan Kom tribesmen beat the dying with a rope and urge them to get on with it . <P> Prayer by the Squirt . When life is gone , mourning begins . Its variations are endless . Until recently , the Dakota Indians slashed themselves with knives , sometimes even killed themselves in transports of bereavement . The Ovimbundu simply wear a leather thong on the left wrist . <P> When a king dies , the Buganda of Uganda raditionally slaughter all his wives-along with hundreds of ordinary tribesmen-to keep the old boy company . Poles abstain from sewing , for fear of pricking the soul of the departed . Many Jews , after the death of a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Mongols abstain from marrying for three years . Moslems may call in a professional prayer artist , who prays into an airtight goatskin until he has blown it squeaky-full of airy prayer , which he sells at so much a squirt . <P> In the midst of such goings on , the body is prepared for burial . In many societies the big toes of the corpse , or sometimes the ankles , are tied together , usually in order to keep the spirit of the dead from wandering around the house . Mongols anoint the forehead of the corpse with butter and then place a yellow willow leaf upon the same spot 72 times . The Buganda remove the intestines from the body , wash them in a kind of beer and save the beer , which is then imbibed by the dead man 's widows . In most societies some sort of death dress is provided , but seldom , except in the most primitive tribes , and in the U.S. , is the face of the corpse painted to drive away the " evil spirits " - namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead . <P> Dead Man 's Door . The celebration of the funeral usually begins with some sort of dance , drama or procession . The Dahomeans of West Africa dance with the corpse before they throw it in the grave .
