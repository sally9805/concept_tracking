The twelve executives on TIME 'S cover this week do not exhaust the list of movers and shakers in advertising . But each represents an advertising philosophy or technique that has helped to make the industry what it is and seems likely to shape its future . <P> <P> STROUSE : The Professional Manager <P> THE General Motors of U.S. advertising is New York 's J. Walter Thompson Co. with 17 U.S. branches . 38 abroad , and worldwide billings last year of $380 million . In the driver 's seat at Thompson is President Norman Hulbert Strouse , 55 , a determinedly unemotional man whose prime strength lies not in the creative side of advertising but in meticulously efficient administration of his sprawling organization . Like Strouse , who wears a toothbrush mustache and half-rimmed glasses , Thompson exudes an air of solid dependability . It shuns the hard sell to turn out orthodox , convincing ads for such blue-chip clients as Ford , Kodak and Kraft Foods . Strouse became the third chief executive in Thompson 's 84-year history in 1960 , when he was hurdled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then 81 , who had run the agency for 44 years . The self-educated son of a railway clerk , Strouse joined Thompson as a space buyer in San Francisco 33 years ago and , after a World War II stint as a major on MacArthur 's staff , rode the Ford account to the top of the agency . In his spare time , Strouse turns out handsomely designed pamphlets on a hand printing press in his elegant triplex apartment on Manhattan 's Beekman Place . <P> <P> HARPER : Cussed &; Discussed <P> MAN is captured by what he chases , " says Marion Harper , Jr. , 46 , chairman of Interpublic , the top block in the complex corporate structure that has grown out of Manhattan 's McCann-Erickson agency . What hulking Marion Harper openly chases is Norman Strouse 's crown as head of the biggest U.S. agency . Gifted with uncommon ability at convincing argument and a metabolism that enables him to step into a conference with a client daisy-fresh after 24 solid hours of work , Harper became president of McCann at 32 . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Coca-Cola and Buick and has increased its worldwide billings 600% to $371 million last year-second only to Thompson . An Oklahoman who went to Andover and Yale , Harper is an inveterate theorist who has become the most cussed and discussed man in advertising by expanding McCann into a maze of separate companies , each designed to offer advertisers a different kind of communications or advertising service . So far , Harper 's costly expansion program has left McCann with small profit , but his competitors still keep a nervous eye on the thrusting man who begins each day at his $150,000 Irvington , N.Y . home by simultaneously reading a book and pedaling a few miles on his stationary bicycle . <P> GRIBBIN : The Copywriter 's Friend
