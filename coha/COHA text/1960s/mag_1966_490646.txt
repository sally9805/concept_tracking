THE , TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and C 01M7lent OUR old friend the International Organizations Exchange Specialist for the Library of Congress has communicated with us again , after a lapse of several years , and has graciously sent a list of some of the groups his office has been in touch with since we last heard from him : International Old Time Dance Congress International Federation of Friends of Nature International Congress of Amateur Figure Collecting Symposium on Development of Entrepreneurial Spirit World Underwater Federation International Marionette Union International Congress on the Age of Enlightenment International Congress of Medical Morals Symposium on Water in the Unsaturated Zone Consultation on Christian Attitude to Money Scandinavian Symposium on Aroma Research Association of French-Speaking Dietitians International Colloquium on Open-Air Prod uction International Conference on East-West Influences in the Theatre as a Total Spectacle International Association of Paper-His-torians Toastmasters international Convention A word of advice : Persons seeking to discover common threads , significant links , or global patterns among the above-named groups are urged to abandon the search . Immediately . Two Commissioners THEprevailing opinion about former Police Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Lindsay , who replaced him as a result of their controversy over the civilian-review-board question clearly seems to be that he made his mark as an outstanding public servant during his eight months ' service , which ended last week . Eager to learn what he himself had to say about his service , the police , and the city 's problems in general , we asked him for an interview , and he agreed to meet us on his last Saturday afternoon in office at the house of a friend of his in Greenwich Village , not far from Police Headquarters . We got there first , and the Commissioner presently arrived in the customary forbidding black official limousine . When he was inside the house and had his overcoat off , we found him to be tall , lean , almost unbelievably fit-looking for a man who had just spent eight turbulent months in such a demanding and harassing job , and dressed , like an impeccable undergraduate , in a fuzzy tweed coat , gray flannel trousers , a striped shirt , and a foulard tie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sofa with a drink in front of him , we asked him for some reminiscences . " Well , events have been moving so fast that I have n't had much chance to think about the past eight months , but did do a little reminiscing yesterday , " he replied . " It was at a luncheon given for me by some of the superior officers of the Police Department . The affair had been set up some time ago , when my reappointment was expected , and I have a feeling it was scheduled to he a gripe session , but , as things turned out , it was a farewell . Anyhow , told them that as far as I was concerned the high point of my term had come right at its beginning  --  or , rather , about a month after its beginning . It was in July , when I 'd first taken my stand on the review-board question , and some policemen parading outside Headquarters had been alleged to have made remarks reflecting race prejudice . A few days later , I laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the force who could n't do his job without showing prejudice should get out , and get out right away . Of course policemen have prejudices there are nearly twenty-seven thousand of them in the Department , and they 're like everybody else  --  but I insisted that they leave their prejudices behind them when they were on the job . That was rough talk , especially coming from a new man , and I was rather apprehensive about what would happen the following week , when I was to meet the line officers  --  representatives of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association and the associations of captains , lieutenants , detectives , and so on . They endorsed my statement on prejudice unanimously , and it was then I got the feeling that we could go places . They lived up to their word , too . On the record , the rest of my tenure was strikingly free of evidences of police pre j adice . " T do n't mean to imply that it was all downhill after that . Far from it  --  at least , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that it has been a tough eight months , and not just for the police . To begin with , there was the summer , which people were worried about because of the riots we had had in 1964 . That it turned out they need n't have worried is attributable largely to a lot of hard work that went on under Commissioner Murphy , before I came in . Community leaders , particularly in the areas with large Negro populations , were great about opening up new channels of communication with the police , and the local police commanders sat down with them and worked out plans . LVell , as you know , we had a quiet summer . Then there was the mayoral campaign , and then- was a time to try a police commissioner 's soul . Everybody , of whatever party , was running on the issue of ' crime in the streets ' ? in effect , running against the police . I happened to think then , as I think now , that the phrase ' crime in the streets , ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hypocritical way of expressing prejudice . And the worst of it is that in particular parts of New York City crime in the streets is a fact  --  for peoph-in Harlem or Bedford-Stuyvesant it 's not a political phrase , it 's a real and present danger . Yet on a citywide basis this is a pretty damn safe city ; when you compare violent crimes per capita here and in Chicago or Philadelphia , for example , it 's almost unbelievable how far ahead we are . But all through the campaign I had to stay silent . I could n't say , ' Maybe the Police Department is n't so bad , ' because that would be throwing the Department into politics . I 'm not what you 'd call an easy talker , but I do have trouble holding my tongue when I 've got something to say , and from my point of view it was a long , long political campaign . " The Commissioner filled a pipe and lit it . Then he went on , " When I was appointed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always would be . I think I can safely say now that I have n't changed my mind about that . But , in a way , we were extraordinarily lucky . We had a series of events that caused the public to come in contact with the police in an unusual context  --  to see a community of interest with the police , rather than the usual antagonism . You know , ordinarily the policeman lives in a world of his own . There 's a harrier between him and the rest of humanity , and , as a result , he 's much happier when he 's dealing with other policemen . He becomes isolated . If there 's one reason police morale is comparatively high now , it 's because of these events that brought the police and the public together . The first was the Pope 's visit , in October , and that was just a good day , the way some days are . Candidly , I was terribly apprehensive , with the President and the Pope here at the same time , hut everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the power blackout , in November . Here was an emergency totally unforeseen and unforeseeable . In the first place , there was no way we could have had extra men on duty for it , and , in the second , once it had come there was scarcely any way we could get hold of off-duty policemen and get them hack on duty . Well , those off-duty people , by the hundred , just reported in on their own . Everybody knows that the public behaved extraordinarily well , but not so much has been said about one particular rani ' they behared well  --  in cooperating with the police . Civilians performing police functions in a useful way is something that we do n't see often  --  nor do we want to . But I toured the city most of that night , and one thing I 'll never forget is a priest in a brown habit  --  I guess he was a Franciscan  --  directing traffic on Thirty-second Street somewhere over on the West Side . I ca n't say he had it going like clockwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , there was the transit strike . Although it was a terrible time for the city , it was a wonderful time for the police . It was something all but unheard of  --  a long period during which the police and the public were in a close and non-antagonistic relationship . People knew that police had to fight their way in to work just like everybody else , and they saw that each day things got a little better , or a little less had , and they appreciated it . Like the rest of the Department , I enjoyed it . Mayor Lindsay was for declaring an emergency right at the start , but I talked him out of it ; an emergency would have meant restrictions on cars entering the city , among other things . I moved a bed into my office , and I used to go up for a helicopter survey of traffic early every morning , when incoming traffic was worst ; then , later , I 'd tour Manhattan by car , trying , sometimes not very successfully , to go always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he had had anything to do with the introduction of motor scooters for pat rolmen . " As you know , Inspector Johannes Spreen had the idea , " he replied . " My contribution was to get enthusiastic about the scooters , and to extend their use . Somebody said to me , ' What about the infernal noise those machines make ' And I could only reply , ' When we begin to hear complaints about noise in areas where they used to complain about lack of safety , we 'll know that the scooters have succeeded . ' " We asked the Commissioner how his job had affected him personally , and his view of himself . " Despite everything , it 's seemed to agree with me , " he said . " I 've gained twelve pounds , and that 's fine , because I was underweight before . When I came in , the men in the Department were wary of me . Because of newspaper reports , I was surrounded by a powerful atmosphere of being an egghead , and that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while for me to live that reputation down , but I think I accomplished it . One thing I found out about myself : I 'd always thought THE NEW YORKER of myself as not being outgoing , not being able to reach people , and now I feel I 've reached these people . Even so , I 'll admit that one of the tributes I liked best came from outside the Police Department  --  well outside it . It came from Professor Jerry Finch , of the English Department of Princeton , where I went to college . He 'd read one of my more polemical statements in the newspapers , and lie wrote to say that he had no idea of the merits of the controversy involved but that he considered my statement to he an excellent example of expository prose . " We asked the Commissioner how , as a result of his experience , he feels about the prospects for American cities , and he replied , " As to New York , I 've found the problems  --  and they 're truly formidable ones  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the public apathy toward law enforcement that you hear so much about . Nor have I found public hostility to the police to he as pronounced as it has been painted . Those stories about three hundred howling people taking a prisoner away from a policeman on a hot night arc usually- nonsense . More often , it turns out that there were six or seven cronies of the prisoner yelling at the top of their lungs and two hundred and ninety-some bystanders just watching . A lot of the hand-wringing about cities is politics and prejudice . As a result of the past eight months , I have become more , rather than less , optimistic . The prospects for New York as a decent community are good . " After glancing at his watch , Commissioner Broderick said he had to be getting hack to Headquarters ; he had some final papers to clear off his desk and a disciplinary case to wind up , and , besides , he had to get some papers together for the incoming Commissioner , Howard Leary , who was to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day to talk over some aspects of the job . We walked out onto the stoop with him , and found the black car and its driver waiting at the curb . " I 'd like to think I 've made a few contributions as Police Commissioner , " Broderick said , standing on the steps . " For one thing , when I 've seen good or great police work I 've said so  --  to the officer and to the public  --  and that has n't always been done in the past . Superiors have often been afraid their praise would he used against them later on . Second , I 've aired some controversies , such as the one about who does run the Police Department and who ought to , that I think ought to he aired . Third " ? the Commissioner gave us a barely perceptible smile and a parting wave ? " I 've proved beyond cavil the adage ' You ca n't fight City Hall . ' " ? THOMAS PEARSALL FIELD HOVING , the city 's new Commissioner of Parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable eye for authenticity , . When he joined the staff of the Metropolitan Museum , as a curatorial assistant , in 1959 , his first assignment was to write a letter to an art dealer in Europe rejecting a marble carving of the Annunciation . " You ca n't reject this , " he told his superiors . Under a canopy of lifted eyebrows , he set out to prove what he had discerned . Ile went through hundreds of photographs in the Museum files , looking at each one for no more than a second . " The trick was to go rapidly from picture to picture , " he says . " Then , when you hit it , you knew at once . " In such an instant , he discovered that this particular Annunciation was a section missing from a beautifully carved pulpit in Florence  --  twelfth century . James Rorimer , the director of the Metropolitan , put his new employee in charge of all medieval acquisitions , and eventually made him curator of The Cloisters . In this position , way up in Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses , from the occupation he might once have been expected to follow . His father , Walter Hoving , is a former president of Bonwit Teller and the present chairman of Tiffany &; Co . The younger Hoving never showed much interest in Bonwit or Tiffany . However , a couple of years ago , in another shop on East Fifty-seventh Street , he found a pendant that looked too right to him to he ignored , so , on instinct , be bought it for the Museum . It was made of what he describes as a " soft , wonderful , French-butter type of gold , " with concentric inscriptions and two figures  --  a bishop blessing a queen . According to the Museum , floving 's pendant is one of two known reliquaries of St. Thomas A Becket . In 1962 , he spent several days in a hank vault in Zurich studying a twelfth-century ivory cross , identified it as genuine , placed its origin at Bury Saint Edmunds , and arranged its purchase , for more than half a million dollars . Roving , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Sources of the Ada Group Ivories . " He studied under Kurt Weitzmann there . Weitzmann , in turn , had studied at the University of Berlin under Adolph Goldschmidt , the author of important hooks on Carolingian and Romanesque ivories . " I was to he third in a chain of great ivory historians , " Hoving says , with neither regret nor vanity in his voice . " The sequence was to have been Goldschmidt , Weitzmann , and Roving . Now I am in the Department of Parks . " We happened to know Commissioner Hoving in his earlier incarnation , 36 MARCH 5 , I 9 6 6 and the other day we called on him in his new surroundings to see how they agree with him and to learn what he plans to do in the job . His desk , on the third floor of the Arsenal , in Central Park at Sixty-fourth Street , is in an octagonal alcove with a white-andblack checked floor , pea-green walls , and a prevailing sound  --  from the zoo , below  --  of seals barking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a dark-brown suit with a vest , smoking in a kind of Continental-backhand manner , answering quick successions of phone calls , and dealing with a flow of subordinates , Hoving had completely put aside the manner of the patient scholar and now showed all the impatience and energy of the political appointee in the Kennedy-Lindsay style . Hoving is a tall , very slim man with alert dark eyes . He told us that the main thing he wants to do as Commissioner of Parks is to restore the approach and outlook with which American park systems began . " It all started here a hundred years ago , " he said . " Read this book . " He handed us a sizable volume called " Central Park as a Work of Art and as a Great Municipal Enterprise , 1853-1895 . " This , he explained , was the second volume of the professional papers of Frederick Law Olmsted , who designed Prospect Park and  --  in collaboration with Calvert Vaux  --  Central Park . Hoving had encountered Olmsted 's work in a course in American Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olmsted invented American parks , " Hoving said . " He really did look upon them as works of art  --  everythin related to a controlling idea . Central Park was a swamp . He moved a billion cubic feet of earth to make it . He was the greatest landscape architect in the country . We have the full potential now of choosing and of paying for the best landscape architects to he found . I want to restore a note of energetic creativity  --  to make these places exciting , not just well swept . " The Department of Parks has six thousand employees , and all are under C , n1 S .. rvice except the Commissione. , so Having ca n't go out and hire at will . As a beginning , though , he has raised enough money , through foundations , to pay for the full-time services of a design consultant . We asked Commissioner Hoving how his vest-pocket-park program was coming along . " Do you know who invented the small park ? " he asked . " Jacob Riis  --  in 1897 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody bothered to carry it out . We 're doing it now . A small park can be one lot or a quarter of a block  --  anything . Instead of having a vacant lot full of garbage , you at least have blacktop and a basketball backboard . We need open space in these filthy , congested areas . I know darn well we can build a park , if we have to , for under ten thousand dollars . The point of these little vest-pocketers is that we can do them . We want to do two hundred in the next four years , if possible . We 've got seven in the works already  --  two in East Harlem , one in West Harlem , two in the Bronx , one that Mr. Paley , of C.B.S. , is giving us on the site of the old Stork Club , and one at Twenty-ninth Street and Second Avenue . " In mid-December , Commissioner Hotting said , he read in a newspaper that Robert Moses ' Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority had bought the lot on Twenty-ninth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to build across Manhattan connecting the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel . Hoeing called on Moses and asked him what he was going to do with his vacant lot before he built the new road . Moses said it would be a temporary parking lot , and Hoving proposed that it become a temporary park instead . Moses readily agreed . A landscape architect volunteered his services , and Hoving persuaded a trust to donate twenty-five thousand dollars . " Not to be outdone  --  or undone Moses put up twenty-five thousand to match the twenty-five thousand from the trust , " Hoeing continued . " Then we called in the people of the neighborhood . In Philadelphia , this kind of thing has been done extensively and very well ; neighborhood groups not only have helped to plan parks but have actually done the physical labor of building park structures and devices . The Parks Department here has always resisted this idea . We got the people of that neighborhood together , and , for the first time ever  --  ever  --  in New York , a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will use . The lot is a hundred by a hundred and thirty feet , and they want everything in it , including the whole of Sequoia National Park . After it is finished , they will have to maintain it . I tell them , Do n't expect us to come down here every day with a brush . You 've got to help out . ' We have to bring these things where the people arc . " The little park is expected to last for five years or so , but Hoving hopes that its existence will help discourage the building of the expressway and that it will become permanent . He calls it Mosesplatz . A woman on Commissioner Hoving 's staff came into the office and told him that an ancient lion in the Central Park Zoo was very sick and was going to be put to sleep at five-thirty . The Tinzcs wanted a picture of the dying lion and a statement from Hoeing . " A statement ! " Having said . " Yes . They say that it will be a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the staff woman said . Hoving stared at the green walls , saying nothing at all . Finally , he said , " Poor lion . " Returning to less poignant matters , the Commissioner said that he had two major parks to develop in addition to all the vest-pocketers  --  one in the center of Staten Island ( now called the Green Belt ) , and the other at Breezy Point , the curving peninsula on the southern tip of Queens where the city makes its most dramatic flourish into the Atlantic Ocean . " The decision to acquire Breezy Point was a courageous act by Mayor Wagner , " Hoving said . " He will he remembered for it . He had to condemn very expensive buildings that were being built there . He stopped them as the concrete was being poured . " Hoving feels that in general New York has ignored the possibilities of its waterfront as an aesthetic resource . " This is one of the great deltas in the world , and we 've really messed it up , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand acres of park land is under water there . Jamaica Bay is full of sewage . It needs cleaning Lip . I 'd Like to put parks on piers , so people can sit out on them and watch the city . There are dozens of piers in disuse , and all kinds of opportunities for landfill . We would fill out to the pierheads . I 'd like to put floating swimming pools in the rivers , the way Paris has floating swimming pools moored in the Seine . " Putting his finger on a map of the city , Commissioner Hoving traced the outline of Riverside Park , pointing out that people can walk along the water from Seventy-second Street to the Harlem River . There , he said , he would like to establish a ferry for hikers , then open up the Croton Reservoir right-of-way to them , so that they could continue north into Van Cortlandt Park  --  a fifteen-mile footpath in the wilderness within New York City . " We ca n't develop many large masses anymore , but we can develop long paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build more marinas , too  --  all along the waterfront . Out on the water is the only place you can get away from people . You 're in your own territory when you 're out there . Incidentally , the hig reservoir in Central Park is being phased out , and we 'd like to develop that for dinghies and sailboats . Of course , our biggest problem is crime and safety . Why have parks if people are afraid to go into them and they 're just pockets for rumbles ? We have to drive out the disorderly-conduct element . X.Nre need more lighting , more patrolling , and more education of the young against vandalism  --  all these things balled up into one great juggernaut . Vikfe need more indoor facilities . People still look at recreation from a nineteen-twenties point of view . They think of it as a summer thing . It has to be year-round . " Soon , when the city government is reorganized , Having will have a greater opportunity to carry on this part of his work . His new title will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his new department will have the responsibility for parks , recreation , and cultural institutions and affairs- We asked the Commissioner how long he has known Mayor Lindsay . " I worked for John in congressionals-1960 , 1962 , 1964 , " he said . They met one night when they were passing out leaflets in the same apartment building . They became friends . Last spring , a member of Lindsay 's staff called Roving at The Cloisters and asked him to prepare a stud ) of the city 's park system . This became one of Lindsay 's white papers , and is now more or less the working manual of the new parks program . Having still gets around the city on a second-hand Czechoslo vakian motorcycle , which he used for commuting between the Metropolitan Museum and The Cloisters . He says that he works seven days and seven nights a week in his new job . We asked if he ever misses the Museum . " No , " Having said . " This is real life . I used to tell my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just sculpture . Painting . ' Last month , I put a mountain down in Tomkins Square Park . There was a great B unk of dirt there , about twenty feet high and forty feet across . A contractor was about to haul it away . Kids were playing all over it . I told the contractor to leave it there . Some people in the Department said we could n't possibly do that , because the mound contained three thousand dollars ' worth of topsoil . I reminded them that a standard concrete sandbox costs from sin to eight thousand dollars . We left it there . A couple of weeks ago , some children in that area went sledding for the first time in their lives . "
