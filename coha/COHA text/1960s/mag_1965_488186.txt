The General Assembly is in the throes of its annual denial of United Nations membership to Red China and , as usual , the United States is in the forefront of the battle against Peking . The spokesman this time was Ambassador Goldberg , but it might as well have been Adlai Stevenson or Henry Cabot Lodge . The script was the same , and Goldberg 's reading was inferior , from a theatrical standpoint , to that of either of his predecessors . There may be valid reasons for denying membership to Red China  --  or withholding the offer of it , for it is by no means likely that the Chinese would accept . The reasons given in the Goldberg ( or State Department ) statement are so hypocritical , however , that none but the child minds of international politics can give them credence . China is accused of designs to " change world order by force and violence " and to reject " fundamental restraints- on the use of force in the UN charter . . . . " This is quite true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Communist allies believe in the use of force and violence to resist changes in the world order , and not only believe in it but practice it without restraint . It is the United States that is flooding South Vietnam with , men and arms , attacking civilians and combatants in both Vietnams indiscriminately from the air , and making it plain to the Chinese that if they dare to come to the aid of the North Vietnamese they will receive the same treatment . The Chinese , as witness Marshal Lin Piao 's call for world revolution , are vocally the more belligerent , but no nation can surpass the United States in its willingness to use force  --  and that holds for the Truman , Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations as well as the present one . The debate might more logically turn on a proposal to expel the United States from the United Nations , or apply sanctions against it , rather than on whether the Chinese should be admitted . If , in the present world order , any nation , with the exception of the Scandinavian countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to be in the national interest , that nation has somehow hidden its virtue from historians . Israel joined England and France in an attack on Egypt , which had provoked the attack by aggressions of its own . The Soviet Union put down counterrevolution in Hungary by force . The United States abetted an invasion of Cuba . As Goldberg was mouthing his lines , India and Pakistan , both armed by the United States , were violating a cease-fire in their war over Kashmir . There may be distinctions and degrees of aggression in these conflicts , but aggression is certainly not peculiar to the Chinese . The script is so hackneyed that it hardly merits this much discussion , but its delivery by Ambassador Goldberg is a bad augury . The President pulled him out of the Supreme Court , and one could assume that the selection of a negotiator of Goldberg 's caliber foreshadowed a less sterile policy . One could also assume that Goldberg thought he could serve the cause of peace in accepting the appointment . He is in a position to influence policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he merely reads the kind of drivel Washington furnishes him , he will contribute neither to the cause of peace nor to his own reputation He is , as Eric Sevareid says , a man of character and proper pride . Let him show it , for only so can he serve his country and himself . The Crackdown Dissent is not for milquetoasts . In our time , dissent is especially prohibited when it touches on any of the fighting wars which spring from the cold war . It does not matter how respectable the dissenter has previously been ? the instant he finds anything wrong With U.S policy in Vietnam or , more broadly , anywhere abroad , the crackdown begins . Over the past several years , Martin Luther King has added luster to the dissenting tradition , as his great namesake did before him Actually , his dissent was not so much antagonistic to accepted views as a reaffirmation of the principles of the Declaration of Independence in respect of ' race . Actually , also , Dr. King is a most moderate leader of the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost intolerable affronts and injuries Except among homicidal racists , he has been regarded with tolerance even by segregationists , and with admiration by most others . But this tolerance did not , for the most part , extend beyond Dr. King 's civil rights activities . When he applied his doctrine of nonviolence to Vietnam , and spoke out against the Johnson Administration 's policies ( as well as against violence on the part of the North Vietnamese and the National Liberation Front ) , ' he was deluged by threatening editorials and cartoons , and by slanted news stories . Included among the admonitions was one from his good friend in the White House , who never resents dissent , except when it is directed his way . The case of Senator Fulbright , for all the differ , ences between him and Dr. King , is in the same style . Mr. Fulbright is that rarity among politicians ? a thinker and prophet . He is , if anything , too modest ; he says himself that he is not a " powerful personality , " a disclaimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among his personal virtues is an acute sense of the value of dissent . In his recent speech on the American big-stick policy in the Carib bean , he succeeded momentarily in undoing , to some degree , the harm that had been caused by our initial intervention in the Dominican . Republic . But his critics , by way of public rebuke , proceeded to push Resolution 560 through the House by a vote of 312 to 52 . The resolution affirms the right of unilateral military intervention by any Western Hemisphere nation into the internal affairs of any other nation in the Western Hemisphere if , in the sole opinion of the intervener , Communists are involved . Adoption of the resolution promptly raised an even greater protest than this magazine had anticipated ( see comments in last week 's issue ) . Initially , neither the State Department nor the White House had opposed the resolution ; later , after an informal poll of Latin American embassies , a last-minute effort was made by the Administration to stop the resolution which it had tacitly encouraged . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Javits and others  --  to repair some of the added damage caused by the ill-tempered and ill-advised rebuke to Senator Fulbright . When it comes to dissent , neither prominence nor obscurity affords much protection . Although he is well known m California , few Easterners have heard of Si Casady , a former newspaper editor who presently heads the California Democratic Council , composed of some , 75,000 of the farthest-left Democrats of the state . Casady has been going about California attacking the Vietnamese war , in the words of Time , as " legally , morally and politically indefensible . " That might have got by , at least for a while , but Casady went on to tell audiences : " It takes more guts to burn a draft card than to go to war . Some people have the guts to stand and say , ' We will not fight for what we do n't believe . ' " The storm broke . Even Governor Pat Brown , who is often praised in these pages , thought Casady had gone too far Acknowledging Casady 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the council . Casady , after a " family blood-bath " meeting of the council 's board of directors , refused . According to Carl Greenberg of the Los Angeles Times , President Johnson had already taken umbrage at Casady 's speeches and might have communicated with Governor Brown before the latter acted . It does not matter too much . The dissenter must expect trouble , and the time when he should worry about his views is not when he is criticized , but when he is praised by the majority and its leaders . The majority is not always wrong , but it is always wrong when it attempts to stifle dissent . Sugar Stick-up In speeches delivered in the House on September 22 and 27 , Rep. Paul Findley ( R. , Ill. ) called attention to one of the more flagrant outrages perpetrated on the American consumer . The domestic price of sugar is in effect fixed by act of Congress or , more accurately , by one very special Congressman , Rep. Harold D. Cooley ( D. , N.C. ) , Chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation sponsored by Cooley would cost American households $3 5 billion in excessive charges over the next five years . What Cooley pre-scribes is also of great importance in U.S. foreign relations , particularly in Latin America . It is equally important to the sugar lobbyists , who are paid up to $50,000 a year by their clients and who work with Cooley to rig the market , all with perfect legality and for the most pious reasons : to " stabilize " the price of sugar , to punish the cold-war enemies of the United States and reward its friends , and to keep domestic sugar producers prosperous and happy . The mechanics of sugar manipulation have been described in past issues of The Nation by Desmond Smith , Boris Swerling and Fred J. Cook , but the lobbyists and their friends in Congress have continued on their own sweet way . The U.S. sugar market is controlled by the Secretary of Agriculture , but the enabling legislation is renewed every year by Congress . The legislation is extremely complex ( perhaps more complex than it needs to be ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session . Most members have neither the background nor the inclination to inform themselves on the technicalities of the sugar industry . It is much easier to defer to Mr. Cooley 's knowledge and experience , both of which are considerable . Mr. Findley 's revolt is exceptional . Usually the legislation goes through smoothly , and no one is the worse for it except the consumers . The stakes are enormous . The world price of sugar is more than 3c a pound less than the U.S. price . At retail , also , a consumer across the line in Canada pays 8c a pound , on this side of the line 11c . This may seem a trifle , but the United States consumes 10 million tons of sugar annually , of which 4 million tons come from abroad . Thus when even a minor suppliant like Thailand obtains a 20,000-ton quota , it is $1,200,000 better off than if it had to sell that quantity on the world market . Whether it gets the quota depends on its , lobbyist , on Representative Cooley , and on technicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept or reject as he sees fit . Of course the other members of Cooley 's House Agriculture Committee may also have something to say but , as Chairman , Cooley has somewhat the same status that Rep. Carl Vinson had in the House Armed Services Committee . Thus when Findley tried to direct questions at sugar-lobbyist fees , Cooley summarily overruled him . It was no one 's business , Cooley said , on what terms the lobbyist worked for his client . The rationale of the sugar program has always been that it creates " price stability . " So it does Findley points out that if prices are fixed at a high enough level , stability is automatically achieved  --  as in any racket or conspiracy in restraint of trade . Findley is not opposed to reasonable regulation in sugar , any more than in other agricultural commodities , but he wants to end one-man domination of the Agriculture Committee and the ' exploitation of the public by acquiescent Congressmen and the sugar lobby He deserves the support of Congressmen whose interest in their constituents is not limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Sarnoff , then 25 , submitted a memorandum on a proposed " radio music box " to his superiors in the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America The company officials , though already aware of Sarnoff 's ability , considered this scheme so harebrained that they did not bother to reply . They had second thoughts in 1921 , when broadcasting burst upon the Radio Corporation of America , which by that time had absorbed the Marconi Company . Within a few years RCA 's sales of broadcast receivers had eclipsed its marine and transoceanic wireless telegraph business , and in another few years Sarnoff was president of the company . Last September 17 , Sarnoff , now 74 , delivered an address at the Conference on World Peace Through Law on " Law , World-Wide Communications and World Peace , " which people familiar with his career consider fully as prognostic as his radio music box idea . We are already in the era of satellite communications , but heretofore the experts have surmised that intercontinental television would continue to require elaborate facilities like those of the Communications Satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV networks for distribution to home receivers . Thus governments and giant ' corporations would decide what the viewers in each country could see and hear  --  and what they were not to see and hear . Sarnoff , who naturally has access to the latest technical advice , now tells us that this is not the way it is going to be . Within five or ten years , he believes , nuclear-powered satellites will transmit TV and radio programs directly to home receivers . Only the home antennas- will require modification , and that presents neither technical nor edonomic problems . It may be added that with the waves coming in at a steep angle there should be less difficulty with " ghosts " than with the present system , where tall buildings , bridges , etc. , often cause multiple images . But it is the political implications that are most disconcerting , or exciting , depending on the viewpoint . Sarnoff asks : " When , for example , a Russian satellite can broadcast directly to a Kansas farm , or an American satellite can broadcast directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both countries ' ? . . . What rules of conduct are to apply , and who is to establish them ' ? This question evades the jurisdiction of any established body , yet it will affect the welfare of all nations and all people . " He adds that " it would be a travesty on the hopes of humanity if this immense force for enlightenment , understanding and social advancement were to be subverted to narrow national ends , or become discredited by the failure of nations to agree upon its beneficial uses . " Not so long ago , Sarnoff 's views on the cold war were indistinguishable from those of John Foster Dulles . At the request of President Eisenhower , he prepared a report on psychological warfare measures , using existing means of communication which , had October 11. , 1965 they ' been applied , could only have worsened U.S.-Soviet relations . Now , both the forum he selected and the tone and content of the address indicate a more sober frame of mind . Sarnoff envisions summit conferences , scrambled or open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving their respective capitals , television by the United Nations , international educational programing and , in general , areas of communication designed to " strike a chord of response in civilized man regardless of his nationality or ideological allegiance . " For the moment , at least , . world peace has supplanted the cold war in Sarnoff 's thinking . The outlook for the survival of mankind would be more hopeful if peace should become for him a lasting preoccupation , and if other powerful industrialists and politicians were to follow his lead . A Presidential Front On September 9 , a handsome advertisement appeared in The New York Times and other newspapers an ' nouncing the formation of a new ad hoc committee ? the Committee for an Effective and Durable Peace in Asia , with Arthur H. Dean as chairman . The list of sponsors -- Dean Acheson , Eugene R. Black , James B. Conant , John Cowles , Thomas S. Gates , Roswell L. Gilpatric , John J. McCloy , David Rockefeller , and other equally well-known names=reads like an executive committee for the Establishment . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to Louis Fleming of the Los Angeles Times , it is now known that the committee was set up at the behest of the President " as an answer to numerous peace-front groups that have been attacking American involvement in Vietnam . " One would think that the Administration , in possession of almost unlimited access , at all times . to al media , had been given the fullest possible opportunity ' to state its case to the public . But apparently the President is not satisfied with these ' facilities . Just how the new committee is to be classified in the spectrum of " fronts " is not clear . It could perhaps be called a " war-front group " or " an anti-peace group " or , more accurately , a " Presidential front . " Formation of the new committee is proof , if any were needed , that the decision makers in Washington are - sensitive to the teach-ins and other forms of public protest and discus : . sion of the war in Vietnam . The Marines Have Had It It used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their ability to bring law and order to small , irresponsible Caribbean countries and to collect the just debts due American corporations Boys could hardly wait to grow up so that they could join the Corps , see the world , and kill ' a few insolent foreigners . Although not all of this magic has been . lost , the Marines are being overshadowed by the Central Intelligence Agency , whose members , though not clad in splendid uniforms , live lives of hair-raising adventure . The fact that these activities are secret ( until 207 they become public ) only makes them the more intriguing . We get but fleeting glimpses behind the CIA curtain , ' but these are enough to assure us that ( 1 ) the CIA is everywhere ; ( 2 ) the CIA can do anything ; ( 3 ) the CIA is the chief bulwark of the United States against the jackals of communism . Iran , Guatemala , Vietnam , Cambodia , Cuba , Ceylon , Singapore and other C/A battlegrounds are now joined by Pakistan , and who will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Daily Telegraph of London , which is noted for the excellence and reliability of its foreign news coverage . The writer is Victor Anant , and the story lacks a dateline , because Anant obtained his material in New Delhi and had to make a getaway before he could cable it uncensored . Anant 's account , in his own words , describes " not so much America 's commitment to India , but the State Department 's urgent desire to cut President Ayub Khan down to size . " To this end , in September , 1963 , the CIA stepped up its operations in Pakistan , giving aid to the campaign of Miss Fatima Jinnah , who ran against Ayub Khan in the election of 1964 . After Miss ' Jinnah 's defeat , the CIA people in Pakistan seemingly made ' overtures to the one-time Governor of East Pakistan , General Azam , but without success . However , it was regarded as imperative to punish Field Marshal Ayub for his rapprochement with Red China , and the opportunity came , when the India-Pakistan dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CIA group informed New Delhi that a coup d'etat was imminent in Pakistan , that Ayub Khan would soon be deposed , that Pakistan was preparing an attack in Kashmir , etc . This meddling may well have hardened Indian determination to fight over Kashmir , and later , to open a second front . Anant says it is clear that the Indianshad reason to believe that the United States " would not disapprove of a measured spread of the fighting . " He also cites Prime Minister Shastri 's remark that India was new in the same position in Kashmir as the United States in Vietnam , and his answer to a question on what he would do if the Chinese invaded India : " We have considered that possibility . If that happens we will not be alone . " This could mean only that Shastri relied upon American aid in a form much more decisive than was forthcoming when the Chinese invaded India in 1962 . Our ' State Department promptly denied that it had possessed knowledge of an impending coup in Pakistan or that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denials are routine They have been proved false so often that the CIA , rather than being held innocent until proved guilty , can be assumed to be guilty of any charges made against it by any person of repute , such as Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia , Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of ' Singapore or , in this case , Victor Anant , As Peace News of London ( September 17 ) puts it : " The CIA is probably the most dangerous organization in the world , its only saving element being an infinite capacity for blunder . " From time to time Sen. Stephen M. Young of Ohio makes the same accusation on the floor of the Senate , terming the CIA an invisible government , answerable only to itself , and calling for supervision of its activities and , specifically , for a return to its original mission of centralizing the collection and evaluation of intelligence material . But though probably a majority in both houses of Congress secretly agree , few members will stand up and say so . The prospect is , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue their careers of high adventure .
