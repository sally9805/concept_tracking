Princeton 's President Robert F. Goheen plainly thought he had found poison in his ivy . At a press conference last week , Goheen said angrily : " I think it was an ignorant editorial . " Goheen 's target was none other than the New York Times , which to the ordinary reader seems to observe a Be Kind to Education Week about 52 times a year . <P> The Times had editorially criticized the eight Ivy League colleges for the " haphazard and chaotic conditions reigning in this year 's admissions decisions . " Compelled to turn down 25,740 of 39,380 applicants for next fall , the Ivies admittedly made many decisions more on a subjective evaluation of a candidate than on his academic rating ( TIME , May 23 ) . To the Times , this was engaging in " something that looks like blindman 's buff . " Instead , the Times urged that admissions to the Ivy League schools be governed on a " strictly objective " basis- " an average of entrance examination scores or the like-which would insure that the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bungling . " <P> To Goheen , " the editorial implies there are absolutely reliable measures of individual ability and achievements . At this time these measures do not exist . " Or as Princeton 's director of admissions , C. William Edwards , put it : " It was the most irresponsible piece of journalism I 've ever seen in the Times . If we followed their imbecilic recommendations , we would be in a real mess . " <P> In the Times 's letters column , an irate reader added to the din : " I am glad that the New York Times did not determine college-entrance requirements when I applied for admission . I would not have been in the top group . In subsequent years I made a pretty good trustee of the institution from which the Times would have barred me , but perhaps by accepting me they lost another Einstein ! Nonetheless , I think you are wrong in urging that marks be the sole factor in determining admissions-very , very wrong . In fact , one more ' very . ' " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name made up of his three initials , used by Times Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger.
