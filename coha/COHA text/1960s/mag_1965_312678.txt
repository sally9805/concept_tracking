For months , U.S. newsmen in Saigon had been trying to pin down rumors that South Vietnamese troops " were using gas " - none of the rumors said what kind-against the Viet Cong guerrillas . Last week , quite by accident , German-born Associated Press Photographer Horst Faas succeeded , and thereby touched off the noisiest and most hysterical protests since the Communists accused the U.S. of waging germ warfare in Korea . <P> Macabre Memories . Hitching a ride back to Saigon from a remote staging area , Faas found himself in the midst of a major operation by South Vietnamese troops against a Viet Cong stronghold in Binh Duong province . He noticed that the troops were unusually edgy and soon learned why . Helicopters were scheduled to lay down a cloud of " nausea gas " just before the attack and , while the gas was nonlethal , the South Vietnamese were leery of it . <P> As it happened , the attack was called off . But Faas hurried back to Saigon and told Australian-born A.P . Reporter Peter Arnett what he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' s wires a dispatch that began : " U.S. and Vietnamese military forces are experimenting with nonlethal gas warfare in South Viet Nam . " <P> Hardly anybody noticed the word " nonlethal . " Compared with napalm bombs that incinerate whole villages , or white phosphorous shells that burn a man to the bone , the temporarily disabling gases used in Viet Nam seem more humane than horrible . But the words " gas warfare " and " experimenting " stirred macabre memories . There was the afternoon of April 22 , 1915 , when German infantrymen gave the world its first whiff of poison-gas warfare by sending a huge , grey-green cloud of noxious chlorine rolling over two French divisions in the trenches at Ypres , killing 5,000 , incapacitating 10,000 , and cutting a 31-mile swath in Allied lines . There were the later bar rages of phosgene , chloropicrin , and particularly , of mustard gas . <P> A Decent Respect . The reaction came swiftly , particularly in Britain . The left-wing New Statesman accused the U.S. of raining " secret gases " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mussolini in Spain , are treating the hapless inhabitants of Viet Nam as a living laboratory in which to test their new weapons . " A group of Labor M.P.s voiced " horror and indignation , " demanded that Britain " disassociate " itself from U.S. policy in Viet Nam . In Washington , visiting British Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart censured his hosts , acidly suggested that they " display what your Declaration of Independence called ' a decent respect for the opinions of mankind . ' " <P> Significantly , the Communist capitals were silent until they noticed the fuss that was being raised elsewhere . Only then did Peking weigh in with a blast against America 's " fascist cannibals . " Hanoi , which must have been aware for months that gas was being used , belatedly picked up the cue from Britain and deplored the " barbarity " of it all .
