" When I get my shelter finished , I 'm going to mount a machine gun at the hatch to keep the neighbors out if the bomb falls . I 'm deadly serious about this . If the stupid American public will not do what they have to to save themselves , I 'm not going to run the risk of not being able to use the shelter I 've taken the trouble to provide to save my own family . " <P> This kind of tough talk from a Chicago suburbanite last week had echoes all over the U.S. , as the headlines spread uneasiness and the shelter business boomed . In Austin , Texas , Hardware Dealer Charles Davis stashed four rifles and a .357 Magnum pistol in his shelter and pointed out its four-inch-thick wooden door : " This is n't to keep radiation out , it 's to keep people out . " Davis is also prepared in the event that some of his shelterless neighbors get into his shelter before he does . " I 've got a .38 tear-gas gun , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter , they 'll either come out or the gas will get them . " <P> Swarm of Locusts . " This seems to be something that looms very large in a lot of people 's minds , " says Vice President Roger Culler of International Shelter Corp . Many shelter owners , for example , go to great lengths to keep their shelters secret-even to the extent of passing off shelter construction workers as furnace repairmen . <P> Relations between Los Angeles and Las Vegas are still recovering from a flap over a speech by Las Vegas Civil Defense Leader J. Carlton Adair , who proposed a 5,000-man militia against the possibility of wartime refugees from California pouring into Nevada " like a swarm of locusts . " And Civil Defense Coordinator Keith Dwyer of California 's Riverside County ( pop . 306,191 ) last week told a group of officials and reserve policemen in the town of Beaumont that as many as 150,000 refugees from Los Angeles might stream into Beaumont if there were an enemy attack , and that all survival kits should include a pistol . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwyer , " which denies one 's right to protect oneself and one 's family . " <P> The Ethics of It All . What do the guardians of the Christian ethic have to say about the pros and cons of gunning one 's neighbor as well as loving him ? As more and more families made preparations last week to go underground-with or without submachine guns-various clergymen had various recommendations . <P> THE REV . GEORGE W. FORELL , professor of theology at Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary : " I certainly object to the notion of killing people to save your own life . Even if you shoot people to save your family when your family 's own survival is questionable , that is the use of a certainly evil means to attain an uncertain end ; it assumes you know the end . The Christian counsel here is that one tries to do what is least evil and asks forgiveness for his sin . " <P> THE REV . HUGH SAUSSY of Holy Innocents Episcopal Church in Atlanta : " If someone wanted to use the shelter , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's not what would happen , but that 's the strict Christian application . "
