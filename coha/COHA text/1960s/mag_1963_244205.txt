The only real question about the special election for Texas ' Tenth District congressional seat , once occupied by Lyndon Johnson , was how soundly the Democratic conservative would beat the Republican conservative . The answer , last week , was : soundly enough . <P> Running were Democrat J. J. ( " Jake " ) Pickle , 49 , a onetime Johnson congressional staffer and campaign aide , making his first try for office , and Republican James Dobbs , 38 , a Goldwater enthusiast who resigned as announcer for a right-wing radio program sponsored by Texas Oilman H. L. Hunt to seek the seat for a second time . Last year Dobbs was the first Republican ever to run for the seat , ended up being clobbered by Incumbent Democrat Homer Thornberry , 42,000 to 25,000 . This election came about because Thornberry , who had held the job since Johnson gave it up in 1948 , had resigned to accept a Kennedy appointment to the federal bench . <P> Dobbs ran mostly against Kennedy , with some sideswipes at Johnson ; his campaign signs urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Kennedy 's assassination and Johnson 's succession as President , the wind went completely out of Dobbs 's sails . He lost to Pickle 27,000 to 16,000 , proving only that in traditional Democratic territory like the Texas Tenth , a Democrat who has the backing of the first Texas Democratic President would have a tough time losing .
