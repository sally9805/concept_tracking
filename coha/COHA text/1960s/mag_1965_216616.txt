In the U.S. embassy in London , Adlai Stevenson taped an interview for the BBC defending his nation 's foreign policy . " There has been a great deal of pressure on me in the United States to take a position-a public position - inconsistent with that of my Government , " he said . " Actually , I do n't agree with those protestants . My hope in Viet Nam is that resistance there may establish the fact that changes in Asia are not to be precipitated by outside force . This was the point of the Korean War , this is the point of the conflict in Viet Nam . " <P> Minutes later , Stevenson , accompanied by Mrs. Marietta Tree , an old friend and a fellow member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations , stepped out of the embassy onto Grosvenor Square . Stevenson obligingly paused to pose for a photographer . Then he and Mrs. Tree strolled down the street . About 200 yards away , in front of the International Sportsmen 's Club , Stevenson staggered slightly , grabbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint . " Then he collapsed . Mrs. Tree cried to the club 's doorman : " Quick , come ! Could you come at once and help ? " She knelt over Stevenson and tried to revive him by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . An ambulance arrived , but by the time it reached St. George 's Hospital , Adlai Ewing Stevenson , 65 , the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations , was dead of a heart attack . <P> <P> He was one of the most admired men of his time-and one of the most perplexing , a paradox within himself . Twice he sought his nation 's highest office ; yet he always thought of the presidency as a " dread responsibility . " He was a politician without a politician 's ways ; instead of grinning gamely when , during one of his campaigns , a little girl handed him a stuffed baby alligator , Stevenson could only gape and exclaim , " For Christ 's sake , what 's this ? " He was a man of rare humor , often expressed in self-deprecating terms . Responding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked over the heads of the voters , he tossed out a Latinism : Via ovum cranium difficilis est ( The way of the egghead is hard ) . He loved people and in his later years was one of New York 's most inveterate partygoers ; yet even when surrounded by admirers he somehow seemed lonely . He was a completely sophisticated citizen of the world ; yet he was at home only on his Libertyville , Ill. , farm , chatting with friends in the library or expertly driving a tractor over his 70 acres . " I know every blade of grass and every tree , " he once said . " I like to watch them grow , and I hate to be away from them . " <P> <P> Trauma . Adlai Stevenson was born to affluence and influence . His paternal grandfather , after whom he was named , was Vice President during Grover Cleveland 's second term . His maternal great grandfather , Jesse Fell , was a close friend of Abraham Lincoln , helped arrange the Lincoln-Douglas debates .
