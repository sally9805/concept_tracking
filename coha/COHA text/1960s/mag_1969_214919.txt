The year was 1922 . Dada was dead , Surrealism not yet born . Max Ernst , a fledgling artist who had figured prominently in the former movement and would soon help formulate the latter , was in his native Cologne , yearning for the radical friends that he knew were spawning the most adventuresome ideas of the day in postwar Paris . For Germans in those days , French visas were almost impossible to obtain . Finally , one August night , Ernst slipped across the border . Later he turned up at the Paris apartment of two friends , the poet Paul Eluard and his wife Gala . <P> The Eluards duly installed the fugitive in an apartment in the same building , and Ernst took a menial job in a souvenir factory . It was obviously no place for an artist , and so Eluard offered Ernst a commission to decorate a house that he had acquired at Eau-bonne , 15 miles outside Paris . The young maverick made the most of the opportunity .

There was a giant strawberry in the bathroom . Across a pair of double doors appeared a huge butterfly that seemed to fly when the doors were opened . Between the windows in the dining room stood a delicately tattooed nude flanked by her green shadow . The master bedroom was turned over to Ernst 's Histoire Naturelle , a subliminally suggestive panorama filled with prickly plants , grasshoppers and a lazy anteater carrying its baby over a brick wall . Some of the most charming reveries were reserved for the bedroom of the Eluards ' five-year-old daughter Cecile , who went to sleep each night amid visions of red-eyed fish , blue horses , hydrocycling ducks and gondolas carrying a giant 's foot over limpid waters . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to marry Salvador Dali . Eluard died in 1952 . Ernst went on to enjoy international prominence as a perennial myth maker in sculpture , painting and collage . The house itself was sold in 1929 to a butcher and passed through many hands . <P> One person who never forgot the delightful fantasies was Eluard 's daughter Cecile . Three years ago , she revisited the house at Eaubonne and found the murals covered with layers of wallpaper . It took two years for a restorer , using archaeological techniques , to transfer some of the delicate oils to canvas . The resuit is now being shown at Paris ' Galerie Andre-Frangois Petit . Amazingly , the colors are as bright as the day Ernst painted them , and each of the 14 canvases carries something of that breathless , rarefied atmosphere of in sight and abandon in which they were created . More important , perhaps , notes Paintei Andre Masson , they prove that Ernst was a precursor as far as Sur realism was concerned .
