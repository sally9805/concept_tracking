Faced with five by-elections this month and the highest unemployment rate ( 2.1% ) in three years , impatient Tories have been muttering that line from that old backbench ditty : " Stop dawdling , Maudling . " In his first major House of Commons speech since he succeeded Selwyn Lloyd as Chancellor of the Exchequer four months ago , Reginald Maudling last week presented a long-awaited " policy of expansion " that surprised even the most skeptical Tories with its boldness . When he had finished , he left no doubt that the economy was to dawdle no more . <P> Industrial investment , one of the economy 's most sluggish sectors , is to be spurred by substantial new tax allowances on new plant and equipment that should pump close to $300 million a year back into industry and allow it to compete on better terms with European manufacturers . Exports , which have not risen in the last three months , are helped indirectly by the biggest cut ever made in the government 's stiff sales tax on autos : the new tax , slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * will save consumers close to $300 on an average medium-sized model , and increase production in a key export industry whose health directly affects many other segments of the economy . Consumer spending is already " rising vigorously " and needs no push . <P> Government spending will be stepped up in the hard-hit unemployment areas , such as northeast England and Scotland . New roads , factories and towns will be built to prepare for " the next wave of industrial expansion . " Building , one of Britain 's most inefficient industries , will be overhauled by coordinating government construction , streamlining techniques and archaic codes . Public building , which accounts for nearly half of Britain 's national investment program , will be accelerated , while lagging slum clearance and new housing construction will be speeded . <P> In an economy as delicately poised as Britain 's , expansion carries a built-in risk of inflation . However , Maudling warned that he intends to keep wages in line with productivity and , if necessary , discourage consumer spending . Applauded the Financial Times : " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> * Caught short by the tax cut was former Chancellor Lloyd , who bought a new car a few hours before Maudling 's speech , thus paid $200 in extra taxes .
