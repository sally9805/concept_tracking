MEMOIRS OF PANCHO VILLA by Martin Luis Guzmn. 512 pages . University of Texas . $8.50 . <P> <P> He was a swashbuckling ex-bandit who had killed 20 men before he was 30 . His mustache bristled , his eyes burned black , and his temper was so violent that his personal physician forbade him to eat meat . He drove his ragged armies to the spectacular victories that finally brought the revolution to power . Then , claiming its leaders were corrupt , he spent the next six years trying to destroy them , finally retired in disgrace . Ever since his death in 1923 , Mexicans have argued whether Pancho Villa was the Robin Hood he claimed to be-or just an ambitious hood . <P> Author Guzmn , a prominent Mexican historian who knew Villa well , has long been his foremost defender . In this book , he has converted piles of official documents , letters and unpublished notes into the " memoirs " that he claims Villa would have written if Villa had not been illiterate . Reconstructing the old bandit 's speech habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it does not come off very well . In translation , it sounds like bad Hemingway . In content , it ignores the broad historical background necessary to relate Villa 's actions to the progress of the revolution , is stuffed with too many meaningless names and unidentified locations . Even so , it is a frequently fascinating and probably fairly accurate insight into the most controversial character of the Mexican Revolution . <P> Gunpoint Cosigner . Guzmn admits that Villa 's habits were brutal : he shot one man for pushing his horse , ordered another executed because " I saw in his glance that he waa a traitor , " once lined up 60 enemy prisoners in rows of three " to save ammunition by killing three with one shot . " To show his disgust for the dandified " chocolate drinkers " who , he feared , were taking over the revolution , he ordered a prisoner shot in front of his luncheon guests . Villa 's only interest , according to Guzman , was to preserve the revolution for the poor-with whom , as a bandit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he too often let his temper get the best of him . Impatient with arguments , sensitive to the superior ways of his fellow revolutionaries , Villa grew more and more adamant in his own views of how the new government should be shaped , more and more convinced that those who disagreed with him were enemies trying to usurp the revolution . He once flew into a rage at the powerful General Alvaro Obregn , ordered him at gunpoint to cosign a rebellious telegram , then had to retire for more than an hour to restrain himself from shooting Obregon . <P> Film Battle . Unable to throw his enemies out of power , Villa 's temper grew worse and his acts more erratic . In 1915 , he led his army into open rebellion against the government . He tried to enlist the sympathy of the U.S. press by staging a real battle at the request of a film company . He tried to discredit the regime by raiding the border town of Columbus , N. Mex. , and , although he achieved headline notoriety by disappearing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led a 12,000-man punitive expedition after him , Obregon did not fall .
