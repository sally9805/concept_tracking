( See Cover ) <P> In Miller 's Cafeteria , in downtown Denver , four young women met for the afternoon coffee break-and almost immediately began talking about what weighed heaviest on their minds . Said Louise Epperson , a bank clerk : " I 'd just as soon be killed as come out of a shelter and see the country desolated . ' ' Gail Pitts , an account executive with a public relations firm , felt differently . " I want to be around when it 's all over , " she said , " but I must admit I do n't care too much about the idea of a fallout shelter . Still . . . " The third girl , Barbara Walz , an oil company receptionist , had a specific concern : " It 's the children who give me the most worry . With my husband in one place and me in another , and the children at school , we really have no control . " Marion Booth , office manager for a public relations firm , has no children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about my husband and mother . We have a good basement in our house , and I 'm thinking of fixing it up as a shelter . " <P> By then , Denver 's working girls were deep in a conversational subject that has taken over the U.S.-survival under atomic attack . At cocktail parties and P.T.A . meetings and family dinners , on buses and commuter trains and around office watercoolers , talk turns to shelters . Almost everyone-man , woman and child-has an opinion . Those opinions differ wildly . Many feel that blast and fallout shelters are cowardly . " They would convert our people into a horde of rabbits , scurrying for warrens , where they would cower helplessly while waiting the coming of a conqueror , " said Major General John B. Medaris ( ret. ) , former chief of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency . Others believe that other moral values are at stake . Said Rabbi Maurice N. Eisendrath. president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations : " It is the morality of men and affairs which challenges us , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in storm cellars . " <P> Partisans on the other side are equally outspoken . They range from Chicago 's Syndicated Lovelornist Ann Landers , an all-out advocate of home shelters , to President John Kennedy . Said Kennedy in a July 25 television speech to the nation : " To recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the missile age without our citizens ' knowing what they should do and where they should go would be a failure of responsibility . " In the coming months , he said , the U.S. Government would undertake to " let every citizen know what steps he can take without delay to protect his family in case of attack . "
