Ancient America was not as primitive as moderns may think . The discovery of a network of earthen ridges , engineered with geometric precision by pre-Columbian aborigines in South America , is persuading archaeologists to revise their theories . <P> Aerial photos taken over the sparse , seasonally flooded fields of northern Colombia-50 miles east of Monteria in the San Jorge River district-first revealed what even the earliest conquistadors overlooked or could not see : more than 1,400 sq . mi. of intricate clay corrugations , built generally at right angles to the several rivers in the area and standing in bold relief among the numerous waterways . The ridges are as much as five feet high , 20 feet wide , and a mile long . Other ridges run in checkerboard patterns , while a third type extends in long parallels without apparent orientation to the winding riverbanks . <P> Pandora 's Box . An unknown aboriginal people built the washboard-like excavations possibly more than 1,000 years ago , using only the crudest implements , without benefit of metal tools or draft animals . Their motive remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying between the ridges may have carried water to or from grain or root crops grown on top of the long mounds . <P> Berkeley Geography Professor James Parsons and Graduate Student William Bowen report in the Geographical Review that the area once may have supported as many as 80,000 people , a vastly greater aboriginal population than has ever before been attributed to such an American tropical lowland . The discovery , they write , " opens a Pandora 's box of questions relating to cultural origins . " To which Parsons adds , " The discovery might even have implications of transpacific migration . " <P> It seems surprising enough that archaeologists should have missed such a find for so long-the area lies beneath a well-traveled air route to Bogota . Even more humbling is the knowledge that these aboriginal people were sophisticated enough to turn their hostile environment to such advantage . According to carbon 14 dating of a shell mound near the area , the newly discovered culture goes back to 3090 B.C. , making it the oldest pottery site recorded in the New World . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malaria control made a 20th century dent on the ridged plains of Colombia .
