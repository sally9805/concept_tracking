 | Against Pornography A few brave words on behalf of censors and official hypocrites ? together with some unfashionable suggestions on how to look at human behavior , both artistic and erotic . P ornography is like a squalid , unnecessary little country which owes its independence to a vagary of history . But , though pornography is seldom of much importance , it may be of considerable interest , for to talk about it is unavoidably to talk about the Great Powers adjacent to it . Pornography speaks the language of Art ; in recent centuries it has come within the sphere of influence of the Law ; Psychology and Morals have vested interests in it . Moreover , occasionally pornography becomes genuinely important ? when it is used as a seat of operations by the erotic nihilists who would like to destroy every sort of social and moral law and who devote their effective energies to subverting society as such . One who undertakes to discuss pornography finds himself , willy-nilly , falling back upon some of his ultimate positions in matters aesthetic , social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , he is likely to view them as principles ; if he disagrees , prejudices . Here are some of mine . Before plunging ahead , I had better indicate two mutually antagonistic dispositions , one liberal , the other conservative , in my opinions on pornography . On the one hand , I favor the liberal view that the less power the state and the police have over us private citizens the better , that the less the state concerns itself with the individual 's thoughts , entertainments , and sexual actions the better , and that we should do what we can to keep from drifting toward totalitarianism . In other words , let us have no censorship because it strengthens the state , which is already too strong . Also let us have none because most of the things that in fact get censored are less harmful than some of the things that do not ? for example , large-circulation newspapers and magazines . Society is harmed far less by the free circulation of a book like Fanny Hill than it is by  | routine and accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherit ten million dollars , pour acid on his wife , or win a Nobel Prize , and reporter and photographer are made to intrude upon him and his family and then to exhibit to public view in as gross a manner as possible his follies , shames , or just plain private affairs . Such invasions of privacy are not only allowed , they are allowed for the purpose of letting the public enjoy these same invasions vicariously , all in the name of freedom of the press . I believe that this accepted practice has done more damage to society as a whole and to its citizens individually than massive doses of the most depraved pornography could ever do . So much for my liberal views . On the other hand , I favor the conservative view that pornography exists among us and is a social evil , though a small one . That is , in a good society of any sort I can imagine ? not some daydream utopia where man is impossibly restored to sexual innocence but a society populated with recognizable , imperfectible men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pornography , which is to say , considerable firmness in the drawing of lines beyond which actions , words , and images are regarded as indecent . Furthermore , the opinion that pornography should not be restrained I regard as being commonly a symptom of doctrinaire liberalism and occasionally an evidence of destructive nihilism . A liberal suspicion of censorship and a conservative dislike of pornography are not very compatible . Some sort of compromise is necessary if they are to live together . Their marriage will never be without tensions , but maybe the quarrel between them can be patched up well enough for practical purposes . Originally the word pornography meant a sort of low erotic art , the writing of and about whores with the intention of arousing a man 's lust so that he would go to a whore , but some centuries ago , the word , like the practice itself , came to include considerably more than aesthetic pandering . It has come to overlap with obscenity , which originally meant nothing more than the filthy . Obscenity still means that primarily , but notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of being just low and uninteresting , came to be viewed as filthy , obscene . taboo . Apparently , down in the underworld of taboo , things and functions easily become tinged with sexuality , especially functions as near the genitals as urinating and defecating . In any case . since in common practice no clear distinction is made between pornography and obscenity , I am offering , for the sake of convenience , a definition in which the single word pornography is stretched to include most of obscenity . The definition is mine , but not just mine ; it also reflects the usages and attitudes of my society . Pornography is the representation of directly or indirectly erotic acts with an intrusive vividness which offends decency without aesthetic justification . Obviously this definition does not just describe but also judges ; quite as obviously it contains terms that need pinning down ? decency , for example . But pornography is not at all a matter for scientific treatment . Like various other areas of sexual behavior in which society takes an unsteady , wary interest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pornography is relative , an ambiguous matter of personal taste and the consensus of opinion . The grounds for this definition are psychological , aesthetic , and political . The Criterion of Distance Psychologically , pornography is not offensive because it excites sexual desire ; desire as such is a fine thing , and there are happy times and places when desire should be excited and gratified freely and fully ; moreover , even in inappropriate times and places there is plenty of freefloating desire abroad in the world ; it does n't take pornography to excite excesses of desire among young men and women . Nor is pornography offensive because , in its perverted and scatological versions , it excites disgust ; in the proper context disgust serves the useful function of turning us from the harmful . Psychologically , the trouble with pornography is that , in our culture at least , it offends the sense of separateness , of individuality , of privacy ; it intrudes upon the rights of others . We have a certain sense of specialness about those voluntary bodily functions each must perform for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copulating , performing the sexual perversions from heavy petting  | to necrophilia . Take eating , for example . There are few strong taboos around the act of eating ; yet most people feel uneasy about being the only one at table who is , or who is not , eating , and there is an absolute difference between eating a rare steak washed down by plenty of red wine and watching a close-up movie of someone doing so . One wishes to draw back when one is actually or imaginatively too close to the mouth of a man enjoying his dinner ; in exactly the same way one wishes to remove oneself from the presence of a man and woman enjoying sexual intercourse/Not to withdraw is to peep , to pervert looking , so that it becomes a sexual end in itself . As for a close-up of a private act which is also revolting , a man 's vomiting , say , the avoidanceprinciple is the same as for a close-up of steakeating , except that the additional unpleasantness makes one wish to keep an even greater distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art ? in painting , literature , sculpture , photography , theater ? and my definition implies that it is offensive aesthetically . The central aesthetic issue is not whether certain subjects and words should be taboo but what distance should be maintained between spectator and subject . Because of our desire to withdraw from a man performing private acts and our doubly strong desire to withdraw from a man performing acts which are not only private but also disagreeable or perverted , we wish aesthetically to remain at a certain distance from such acts when they are represented in art . Nothing whatever in human experience should , as such , be excluded from consideration in a work of art : not Judas betraying Christ nor naked starved Jews crowded by Nazi soldiers into a gas chamber nor a child locked by his parents in a dark closet for months till he goes mad nor a man paying a whore to lash him with barbed wire for his sexual relief nor even husband and wife making love . Nothing human is alien to art . The question is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extremely tricky- one . Aesthetically , one good way to keep a spectator at a distance from the experience represented by an image is to make the image artificial , stylized , not like us . If it is sufficiently stylized , it may be vivid and detailed and still keep a proper distance from the viewer . One would normally feel uneasy at being with a lot of men , women , and children engaged in every imaginable form of pleasurable erotic activity . Yet the vivid throngs of erotic statues on certain Indian temples create in the viewer no uneasiness but are simply delightful to look at . The viewer is kept at a considerable remove by the impossible poses and expressions of the statues ; he can not identify with the persons performing the acts . For the statues do not represent lustful , passionate , guilty , self-conscious , confused people like you and me , but pure beings to whom all things are pure , paradisal folk who are expressing their joy in generation and the body by erotic acts : these are stylized artifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper distance from a private experience is to give very little of it ? make the image small , sketch it in with few details . One does not want to be close to a man while he is defecating nor to have a close-up picture of him in that natural , innocent act ? not at all because defecating is reprehensible , only because it is displeasing to intrude upon . One would much rather have a detailed picture of a thief stealing the last loaf of bread from a starving widow with three children than one of Albert Schweitzer at stool . However , Brueghel 's painting " The Netherlandish Proverbs " represents two bare rear ends sticking out of a window , presumably of people defecating into the river below , and one quite enjoys the sight ? because it is a small part of a large and pleasant picture of the world and because the two figures are tiny , sketched in , far away . To be sure , a satiric work of art may purposely arouse disgust in its audience . Even the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Swift knew when he had tiny Gulliver revolted by every blemish on the breast of the Brobdingnagian wet nurse suckling the baby . Our revulsion at the description of her breast sticking out a good six feet , with a nipple half the size of a man 's head , is necessary to Swift 's satiric purposes , and it is kept within bounds by his reminding us that if proportions had been normal ? if Gulliver and she had been about the same size ? both he and we would have been pleased by the sight of her breast . When the artist 's purpose goes to the limit of satire and he intends , as Swift does in the fourth book of Gulliver 's Travels , to disgust us with man as such , then he will force us right into the unpleasantly private , as Swift gets us to contemplate the Yahoos copulating promiscuously and lovelessly , besmeared with their own excrement . The aesthetic danger of such powerful evocations of disgust is that the audience may and often does turn not only against the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | often reviled for his misanthropy in the voyage to the Houyhnhnms ; the fourth book of Gulliver 's Travels is even called a product and proof of madness ? which is convenient and safe , for of course the fantasies of a madman may be pathetic and scary but they do n't apply to us , we are sane . The Erotic Used ? and Misused T here is a special problem raised by realism , because it aims to present people as they actually are . How can a realistic artist be true to his subject if he is forbidden direct access to an area of human behavior which is of considerable importance ? The aesthetic problem is for the realistic artist to represent these actions in such a way as to lead to understanding of the characters without arousing disgust against them or a prurient interest in their activities . When he can accomplish this very difficult feat , then he is justified in including in a realistic work of art representations that would otherwise be pornographic . Here are two instances of intimate erotic acts realistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other of a copulation which is aesthetically justified and hence is not pornographic . In the movie Baby Doll , made by Ella Kazan , a healthy young man and woman who desire one another embrace . By this point in the movie the spectator is convinced that their lust is powerful but banal , and a brief and somewhat distant shot of their embracing would adequately suggest to him how intensely they wanted to consummate their desire . Instead , he is subject to a prolonged series of images , especially auditory images , the effect of which is to arouse his own lust and/or disgust , to no aesthetic end . The kiss becomes so severed from characters and plot that the spectator does not care how the couple are related , but cares only that they are given over to desire , and he is encouraged by the very depersonalization of that desire to give himself over to a lust of his own . He may be excited to want some sort of sexual activity with the next available person , but , more probably , observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute sexual activity on the part of th tator . For , just because the scene in Baby Doll arouses its spectator vicariously and in a theater , the chief appetite it whets is not for casual fornication but for more voyeurism ? which is good at least for the movie business . Even if Baby Doll were a good work of art , as it surely is not , this episode in itself would remain aesthetically unjustified and therefore pornographic , and would merit censoring . The other example of an intimately presented erotic act is from the novel Pretty Leslie by R. V. Cassill . The reader is given an emotionally intense account of a young man and woman copulating in an abnormal way ; the man hurts the woman , and the reader understands how he does it and why she lets him do it . This would seem to be essentially pornographic , yet it is not . The art of this novel redeems its ugliness . The reader is not encouraged to use this episode as an incitement to casual fornication or voyeurism . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters themselves , of a kind he could have got in no other way . To understand what these people were like , how they were connected , and why they did what they did to each other , the reader must be close to them as they make love , and because he knows this is necessary for his understanding , he will not use either the episode or the whole novel for pornographic ends , unless he himself is already perverted . In Baby Doll a natural private act , by being brought close for no legitimate reason , excites an uneasy desire whose satisfaction can only be indiscriminate or perverse . In Pretty Leslie the account of an unnatural private act is not so close as to create disgust but is close enough to lead toward moral understanding and aesthetic satisfaction : there is no other possible way for the novelist to accomplish this legitimate end , and the emphasis he gives the episode is in proportion to its contribution to the whole novel . The aesthetic problem has been stated succinctly by Jean Genet . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no compunction about using pornography and in fact he once made a pornographic movie . But as a writer , he has this to say about his art ( in an interview in Playboy magazine for April 1964 ) : " I now think that if my books arouse readers sexually , they 're badly written , because the poetic emotion should be so strong that no reader is moved sexually . In so far as my books are pornographic , I do n't reject them . I simply say that I lacked grace . " Nothing said thus far would justify legal suppression , official censorship . The effect of pornography in a work of art is aesthetically bad , but it is no business of the state to suppress bad art . The effect of pornography on an individual psyche is that of an assault , ranging in severity from the equivalent of a mere pinch to that of an open cut ; but in the normal course of things one can avoid such assaults without much trou- ble , and besides the wounds they make are seldom very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure , there are people who want and need pornography just as there are those who want and need heroin , but such a secret indulgence is not in itself socially dangerous . Here again , the state has no business intruding : a man 's soul is his own to pollute if he wishes , and it is not for the state to say , " Be thou clean , be thou healthy , close the bathroom door behind you . " It is only when pornography becomes public that , like dope , it takes on a sufficiently political cast for censorship even to be considered . It is unlike dope in that it sometimes acquires political overtones by being used ideologically , when put in the service of nihilism . But in one important respect it is like dope : it usually becomes public by being offered for sale , especially to the young . Sell It Under the Counter T he classic example of pornography is a filthy picture : it is ugly ; it is sold and displayed surreptitiously ; it allows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows two or more men and women posing for money in front of a camera , in attitudes which sexual desire alone would lead them to assume in private if at all . An adult looking at such a picture is roused to an excitement which may lead either to revulsion or to satisfaction , but whatever his reaction , he should be left alone to decide for himself whether he wants to repeat the experience . The state has no legitimate political concern with his private vices . But the effect on young people of such a picture , and especially of a steady diet of such pictures , is another matter . A common argument against allowing young people to have unrestricted access to pornography runs somewhat as follows . About sex the young are curious and uncertain and have very powerful feelings . A filthy picture associates sexual acts with ugly , vicarious , and surreptitious pleasure , and helps to cut sex off from love and free joy . At the most , one experience of pornography may have a salutary effect on the curious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been forbidden might provide him a considerable relief , and if he has feared that he is warped because of his fantasies , he can see how really warped are those who act on such fantasies . Moreover , by his own experience he can learn why pornography is forbidden : experience of it is at once fascinating , displeas- ing , and an end in itself , that is to say , perverse . However , too many experiences with pornography may encourage the young to turn their fantasies into actions ( " in dreams begin responsibilities " ) or to substitute fantasies for actions , and so may confirm them in bad habits . Whatever the validity of this argument , it or something like it is the rationale by which our society justifies its strong taboo against exposing children to pornography . For my own part , I would accept the argument as mostly valid . The state has no business legislating virtue ; indeed , one of the symptoms of totalitarianism is the persistent attempt of the state not just to punish its citizens for wrongdoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what its rulers conceive to be good . But patently the state has the obligation to protect the young against the public acts of the vicious . This means that , in the matter of the sale and display of pornography , the state , the apparatus of the law , should have two effective policies . It should strictly forbid making pornography accessible to the young : " No One Under 18 Admitted . " But as for pornography for adults , the law should rest content with a decent hypocrisy : " Keep it out of the marketplace , sell it under the counter , and the law wo n't bother you . " An assumption underlying such policies is that a certain amount of official hypocrisy is one of the operative principles of a good society . It is hard to imagine a civilized society which would not disapprove of adultery , for the maintenance of the family as an institution is one of the prime concerns of society , and adultery threatens the family . Yet , on the other hand , imagine living in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the informing , spying , breaking in upon , denouncing , the regiment of self-righteous teetotalers . What is obviously needed here is what we have : unenforced laws . Only an all-or-none zealot fails to distinguish between the deplorable hypocrisy of a man deceiving his neighbors for his own gain and the salutary hypocrisy of a government recognizing the limits beyond which it should not encroach upon its individual citizens . Another assumption underlying these recommendations is that the censorship of simple pornography for adults will never be very effective . There is a steady demand for it , and it is not important enough to prosecute at much expense . The main function of laws against adult pornography is to express disapproval of it . Clearly the logic of this argument leads to prohibiting certain books and works of art that  | are now legally available in some parts of the country . For example , in some localities the courts have refused to prohibit the sale of Fanny Hill . This refusal seems to me quite irresponsible on any grounds other than a general refusal to censor pornography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such story as there is in the novel exists for no other purpose than to provide occasions for detailed accounts of sexual encounters , and these accounts are the only passages in the book with power to stir the reader 's emotions . The characters are very simple types without intrinsic interest , and Fanny herself is little more than a man 's fantasy of female complaisance and sexual competence . The one literary quality which has made the book celebrated is a certain elegance of style ; compared to most simple pornography it reads like a masterpiece , but to anyone familiar with eighteenth-century English prose it reads like several other third-rate novels . Surely the world is not in such need of third-rate eighteenthcentury English fictional prose as to allow this consideration alone to justify the public sale of a work of sheer pornography . What else would justify its sale is hard to imagine . To deny that the book is pornographic or to say that its literary value redeems its pornography , is to blur distinctions , and for an august court of law to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions . An essential and conservative function of the state is to say , " Thou shalt not , " to formulate society 's taboos . Unless I am seriously mistaken , in this instance the court , speaking for the state , has refused to draw a clear line which corresponds to society 's actual customs . In our culture the place for nudists is in a nudist colony , not on the city streets , and the way to sell books like Fanny Hill is under the counter , not over it . In the name of enlightenment and sexual permissiveness , the state is violating an actual taboo , and the reaction to many such violations may very well be a resurgence of that savage fanaticism which burns books and closes theaters . What to Censor , and Why I am going to defer a consideration of the nihilistic use of pornography , which would logically come next , and instead look at certain borderline questions of enforcing censorship . The censoring of unquestionable pornography is of little interest ; it pretty directly reflects what decent society considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . But the censorship of borderline pornography demands discrimination and philosophy , without which censorship can degenerate into puritanical repressiveness of the kind there has been quite enough of during the past two or three centuries . Thus far , my argument on what to censor and why has led to a legal position which is at least within hailing distance of common practice in the United States now . To purveyors of raw pornography our practice says in effect : bother your neighbors , especially children , and you will be punished ; leave others untroubled by your vice and you will be viewed with disapproval by the law but left alone . This attitude is fine till one gets down to cases , but once it is a matter of wording and enforcing a law , the question must be answered : how is one to distinguish between pornographic and decent art ? Still , such lines must be drawn if there are to be laws at all , and they must , in the nature of things , be arbitrary . As I see it , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do the censoring ? Whatever the answer to this question may be . whatever the best method of censoring , one thing is clear ? our present method is unsatisfactory . As things stand , an object is banned as pornographic on the judgment of some official in customs or the postal service or else by some police officer prodded by a local zealot . In most cases this judgment presents little difficulty : even civilwith genuine hard-core pornography , the etaliberty extremists who are opposed to all censorship on principle blanch when they are confronted arguably warped stuff , the bulk of the trade . But sometimes there is the question of assessing the value of a work of art , and for this task the bureaucrats and policemen who are presently empowered to decide are unqualified . Should Fanny Hill be offered to the public freely ? When society has said no for generations and when judges and literary critics can not agree on the question , it is wrong to allow a police sergeant to decide the matter . If a duly constituted public authority says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " then the policeman 's duty is clear : arrest the man who displays it for sale . But to leave to bureaucrats and policemen the task of making all the delicate discriminations necessary in deciding whether the novel should be censored in the first place , is genuinely irresponsible of society at large and of legislators in particular . To be sure , cases are brought to court . But the laws offer such vague guidance that far too much depends on the quirks of the judge or jury at hand . No censorship might be preferable to-whatwe have now .  | In fact , a strong case can be made for removing all censorship of pornography . Here are six arguments for abolishing censorship . The first three seem to me valid . ( 1 ) No law can be framed so as to provide a clear and sure guide to bureaucrat , policeman , judge , and jury . ( 2 ) It is very hard to demonstrate that pornography does in fact injure many people severely , even adolescents , for if the desire to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue in antisocial acts . ( 3 ) The less power the state and the police have the better . There are three further arguments against censorship which are commonly used but which I find less persuasive . ( 1 ) Decent citizens can by their very disapproval segregate pornography without assistance from the state . But , in an age as troubled as ours and with so much private indiscipline and theoretical permissiveness in sexual matters , there is little reason to suppose that the moral disapproval of decent citizens would actually stop the public distribution of pornography. ( 2 ) It is arguable that some people are rendered socially less dangerous by having their sexual tensions more or less satisfied by pornography , tensions which unrelieved might well lead to much more antisocial acts . True , but pornography , if it is to help those who need and use it , must be outside the law , clearly labeled shameful ; if society has any respect for them , it will sternly assure them that what they are doing is nasty by passing a law against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) In the past , censorship has not succeeded in keeping books of literary value from being read but has only attached an unfortunate prurience to the reading of them . But the prurience attached to reading pornography derives less from breaking a law than from violating the taboo which caused the law to come into existence . Goodman 's Lovely Daydreams There is another argument , more important and erroneous than any of these six , which is commonly advanced in favor of abolishing censorship . It hinges on a mistaken liberal doctrine about the nature of sexual taboos . According to this doctrine , sexual taboos , like fashions in dress , are determined by local custom and have as little to do with morality as the kinds of clothes we wear . However ? the argument goes ? people frequently mistake these sexual taboos for ethical rules , and pass and enforce laws punishing those who violate the taboos . The result is a reduction of pleasure in sex and an increase of guilt , with an attendant host of psychological and social ills . The obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human spirit from its chief source of oppression and guilt . At the moment in America , this ultimately Rousseauistic doctrine finds extensive elaboration in the writings of Paul Goodman , and is present to some degree in the writings of many other intellectuals . It presents a considerable difficulty : by supposing that the potent and obscure emotions surrounding sexual matters derive from unenlightened customs , it holds out the hope that enlightened views can liberate us from those customs so that sex in every form can become healthy and fun for all . This is a cheery , optimistic view , not unlike the sweet hopefulness of the old-fashioned anarchists who thought that all we have to do , in order to attain happiness , is to get rid of governments so we may all express our essentially good nature unrestrained . Such ideas would show to advantage in a museum of charming notions , along with phlogiston and the quarrel about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin , but turned loose in the world they sometimes cause a bit of trouble . Sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely daydream . But it has come to be a part of fundamental liberalism , and so a part of the body of doctrines accepted by more and more of the rulers of the nation . Conceivably the First Amendment will be taken literally ( " Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press " ) and many or all legal restraints against pornography may in fact be removed . But I believe that so far from eliminating sexual taboos , such an official undermining of them would only arouse the puritans to strengthen the bulwarks ; the taboos would be made more . repressive than ever ; and many of the goods of liberalism would be wiped out along with and partly because of this utopian folly . Decent people had better learn now to censor moderately , or the licentiousness released by liberal zealots may arouse their brothers the puritan zealots to censorship by fire . A civilized method of censoring is feasible . One does not have to imagine a utopian system of extirpating pornography through some sexual revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unnecessary because social relations will be as they should be . In our actual , historical United States , in which perversions and pornography flourish , one can imagine a better method of restraining pornography , which is yet within the framework of our customs and  | procedures . It would operate somewhat as follows . All decisions about what is legally pornographic in any of the arts are in the custody of boards of censors . A board is elected or appointed from each of three general categories of citizens : for example , a judge or lawyer of good repute ; a professor of art , literature , or one of the humanities ; and a social worker , psychologist , or clergyman . These are not exciting categories ; but in them , if anywhere , are likely to be found citizens whose own opinions will reflect decent social opinion and who are also capable of making the various discriminations the task calls for . Obviously it is necessary to keep sexual anarchists off the board ; just as a person is disqualified from serving as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment , so one would be disqualified from serving on a board of censors if he were against censoring pornography . A board of censors must never look to a set of rules of thumb for guidance ? not , as now , to the quantity of an actress 's body that must be covered . Is a burlesque dancer 's breast indecent from the nipple down or is it only the nipple itself that offends ? That way foolishness lies . Rather , the censors must look only to their own personal experience with a given work of art for only in such experience can art be judged . For this reason , the censors should be people for whom society 's taboos are part of themselves , not something in a code external to them . No photograph , drawing , book , stage show , or moving picture is banned by the police except at the instruction of this board . Its decisions , like those of every quasi-official public agency , are subject to appeal to the courts , but the Supreme Court would do all it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocritical : out of sight out of mind , so long as children are not molested . The aesthetic and moral principles guiding the board are roughly these : distance and effect . At the distance of a movie close-up , a kiss between husband and wife can be pornographic . If a child and adult are sitting side by side watching a stage performance of a witty Restoration comedy of adultery , they are at altogether different distances from the play , the adult closer than the child ; but at a marionette performance of a fairytale melodrama they reverse distances , the child closer this time and the adult farther away . As for effect on the spectator , this consideration is only slightly less tricky than distance . The question to be asked is whether a story intrudes on the privacy of its characters in order to give the reader vicarious and perverse sexual excitement or in order to provide him with a sympathetic understanding which he could have got in no other way . These criteria of distance and effect ? these rubber yardsticks ? apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a novel or a movie of some aesthetic merit may be judged as censorable in part . In a movie the part is excisable with more or less aesthetic harm to the movie as a whole ; with a book , if the board decides the gravity of the offense outweighs such literary excellence as the whole book may possess , the book is banned ? not burned , just no longer offered for public sale . This system is scarcely watertight ; it presents plenty of opportunity for contradictions and revisions ; it has tensions built into it . But it would not be likely to become troublesome politically ; for , without strengthening the state , it provides a better way than the present one for our society to enforce certain inevitable taboos . Civilization behaves as though men were decent , in full knowledge that they are not . A Weapon of Nihilism T he last aspect of the subject I am going to deal with is the use of pornography as a weapon of nihilistic destruction , especially by two important writers currently using it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer as William Burroughs is less important because more successful ; that is to say , the very thoroughness of his solipsistic nihilism defeats his purpose , for finally his novels are not only repetitious and revolting but also pointless , so that their failure as art keeps them from being a threat to society . In this general context , the term nihilism signifies a great deal more than it did originally . In Turgenev 's Fathers and Sons , where the word was given political currency , nihilism was quite idealistic ; it held that a given society ( Russia , in that case ) was so corrupt or wicked that it should be destroyed , but destroyed so that a better society could emerge from its ruins . Those nineteenth-century Russian nihilists were extreme revolutionists , and quite high-minded ; they did not advocate murder but political assassination , not promiscuous lust but free love . Among us now , James Baldwin is rather like those oldfashioned nihilists ; he preaches destruction in the name of love . To be sure , the images of sexual love Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of disgust and blame are strong . Still , compared to the thoroughgoing destructivists , he and his books are not so wild . They are tamable enough , at least , to become  | the fashion , for they are interpreted ? against his intention , or at least against one of his intentions ? as preaching little more than a local rebellion , the righting of the injustice which American Negroes have endured for so long . However , there is a nihilism which is not against this or that unjust society or social injustice but against society as such ; its rage is not just political but metaphysical as well ; and pornography is one of its weapons . Genet sometimes strives to be this sort of nihilist . But in his best work , The Balcony especially , he is too good an artist to succeed as a total nihilist . The Balcony creates an imperfect but strong image of the corruptness of modern Western societies , a satiric exaggeration which the audience can recognize as the truth distorted mostly for dramatic effect . Genet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though as a criminal of intelligence he knows that he needs the law his enemy ; but as a dramatic artist he makes meaningful works which by their very structure oppose destruction . And the potential pornography of the works serves a dramatic end . Furthermore , he has made them to be presented in a theater , that most social of artistic forms . As a result , whatever Genet himself wants to say , a play such as The Balcony says to the audience , " Look how monstrously you have warped your society . " So we look ; and it is true , we have warped it monstrously . But this is moral art , this is not the assault of sheer nihilism . To see a performance of The Balcony drives one to serious contemplation of the nature of society and law . What this contemplation leads me to is the conclusion that we must improve our society and firm up our laws , for the alternatives that now appear to be open to us in the way of other social arrangements are not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play does not arouse a nihilistic zeal to destroy society , any more than it arouses sexual desire . The Case of Henry Miller 0 f nihilistic fiction , Henry Miller 's Tropic of Cancer is currently the most widely read and the best spoken of . Miller is not only a fairly good writer , but the personality he projects in his book is attractive . When he stands stripped of his civilization ? stripped down to his language , that is ? the savage that is left is not exactly noble but he is at least honest about himself , selfindulgent , energetic , beauty-loving , and inter- ested in the world , not a cold-hearted , torturing pervert . The one overwhelming moral virtue Miller embodies in his book is self-honesty : if you 're going to be a whore , he says , be a whore all the way . This honesty is doubtless what most attracted Orwell in Miller 's writing , though Orwell was a most fastidious man otherwise . Miller 's prose is usually vigorous and sometimes splendid , and he is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should Tropic of Cancer be censored or not ? According to the standards for censorship advanced earlier in my argument it should not be censored for its pornography : as a work of art , it has considerable merit , and it could not achieve its ends without the use of intrinsically pornographic episodes and images . But the conflict of interests in judging this book is acute , for the purpose of Miller 's novel is not just aesthetic , it is nihilistic as well . The literary value of the book is enough to redeem its pornography but not enough to make one ignore its destructive intention . Tropic of Cancer has no structure and is very verbose ; it is , like Miller 's other books , an anatomy and a segment of his imaginary autobiography , a string of images and actions . But it does have an unmistakable message : society is intrinsically vile , let us return to the natural man . In effect , this return to nature means as little work as possible and lots of loveless sex . Miller has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supposedly pagan rejoicing in sex . Miller himself is honest about his intention . Again and again he represents the sexual antics of his characters as evidence of desperation , lurking behind which is the total despair of meaninglessness . He is what he says he is : an enemy not just of the badness of our society not just of our specific society , but of society as such . To do what he can to get his readers also to become enemies of society , he assaults with persuasive force taboos , especially sexual taboos , which are intrinsic to social order . Yet a whole new set of justifications are needed if Tropic of Cancer is to be banned , justifications having to do with pornography as a destructive social act . As an act against society , to write , publish , and distribute a book like Tropic of Cancer is more serious than to write , publish , and distribute a pamphlet which intellectually advocates the forcible overthrow of the government , but less serious than to take arms against the government ? about on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secure , free government will watch carefully and disapprove of strongly , but not forbid and punish . In other words , the  | only plausible argument for suppressing Tropic of Cancer would be that its publication is a dangerous political act and not that the book is pornographic , even though its pornography is the main instrument of the book 's nihilistic force . If you want to destroy society ? not just write about a character who wants to , but if you want to make your book an instrument for destroying , a weapon ? then you need pornography . For since society , at least Western society , is founded on the family as an essential social unit , nihilists and totalitarians must always attack the family as their enemy ; conversely , those who attack the family as an institution are enemies of our kind of society . The totalitarians would substitute the state for the family ; the nihilists would dissolve both the state and the family in the name of unrestricted gratification of natural appetite . To effect this dissolution , nihilists assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an integral part of civilized order , of society as such . And since of all taboos the sexual ones are much the most important , pornography becomes for the nihilists ( as it does not for the totalitarians , who need taboos ) important as an instrument of dissolution ; obviously a nihilistic representation of people violating taboos will be effective only if the representation itself also violates taboos . The reverse does not hold : pornography is not intrinsically nihilistic ; conventional pornography recognizes and needs the rules it disobeys . Because most pornography is not terribly harmful , and also because of the prevalence of liberal permissiveness in sexual matters , our society is falling down on one of its lesser jobs ? the drawing of firm lines about what is decent . Furthermore , it has not sufficiently recognized that indecency can be and sometimes is put to politically dangerous uses . Society should oppose those who proclaim themselves its enemies and who subvert it by every means they know , not least of which is pornography . But violent repressiveness is not the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f one is for civilization , for being civilized , for even our warped but still possible society in preference to the anarchy that threatens from one side or the totalitarianism from the other , then one must be willing to take a middle way and to pay the price for responsibility . As things stand now , so liberal are we that a professor whose salary is paid by the state can speak out more easily in favor of Tropic of Cancer than against it , applauding not just its literary merits but also what he calls its celebration of sensuality and antisocial individualism . These are his honest opinions , and he , no more than the book , should be censored for advancing them . But his colleagues should not allow themselves to be cowed by his scorn of what he calls their bourgeois respectability but should rise in opposition to those opinions . In Miller 's own presentation , his sensuality would guard against despair but itself becomes a way to despair ; his individualism is a frenzied endeavor to compose a self in the vacuum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain , society , for imposing on him , the absolute victim ; he intends his book to be an instrument for persuading its readers to abandon society , abrogate responsibility to their fellow men , and revert to a parasitic life . He claims that this sensual life is more joyous and fulfilling than any other possible in civilization ; but what he describes is not a sensuality which is indeed a fulfillment for adult persons , so much as a would-be consolation for those who aspire to the condition of babies as a remedy to their grown-up woe . To be civilized , to accept authority , to rule with order , costs deep in the soul , and not least of what it costs is likely to be some of the sensuality of the irresponsible . ( In this respect the politically repressed are irresponsible , being denied responsibility . This would help account for the apparently greater sensuality among American Negroes than among American whites , for as a group Negroes have only recently been allowed to assume much social responsibility . ) But we Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be or not . Perhaps before civilization savages were noble , but , if there is anything we have learned in this vile century , it is that those who regress from civilization become ignoble beyond all toleration . They may aspire to an innocent savagery , but what they achieve is brutality . At the end of Tropic of Cancer , Henry Miller says : " Human beings make a strange flora and fauna . From a distance they appear negligible ; close up they are apt to appear ugly and malicious . " What Miller says is right enough , but he leaves out what matters most . There is a middle distance from which to look at a man , the flexible distance of decency and art , of civilized society , which defines both a man looking and a man looked at ; and from this distance human beings can look pretty good , important , even beautiful sometimes , worthy of respect .
