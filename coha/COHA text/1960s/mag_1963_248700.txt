COLD WAR <P> In Washington the ambassadors were ushered into a floodlit anteroom and welcomed by Virginia Duke , a chic State Department employee with greying hair , who bears the title of Treaty Depository Officer . In Moscow a variety of Foreign Office types ushered the diplomats into a dazzling gold-and-white marble room in the Spiridonovka Palace . In both cities , and in London as well , the emissaries of nation after na tion lined up to sign the nuclear test ban treaty . Eventually , by State Department estimate , there will be more than 100 signatories . Khrushchev called it " a referendum on all continents . " Inevitably , the world 's attention focused on the nonsigners . <P> Chief among them is , of course , Red China . Heightening their bitter ideological quarrel with Moscow , the Chinese charged that four years ago Nikita Khrushchev had welshed on a promise to help them make atomic bombs because he wanted to present " a gift " to President Eisenhower on the eve of the Camp David talks . In a bitter radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Soviet leaders " in negotiating the nuclear test ban " is to compromise with the U.S. in order to maintain a monopoly of nuclear weapons and lord it over the socialist camp . " Peking added savagely that Khrushchev had committed an act of " betrayal " resulting in " open capitulation by the Soviet leaders to U.S. imperialism . " <P> The Slow Ones . China 's antitreaty stand was backed by avowedly pro-Peking Albania , North Korea and North Viet Nam . So far , these are the only countries that have formally announced that they will not sign . But chary of angering the Chinese , other Asian nations have been slow to indicate their approval of the pact . They include Nepal , which lies in an exposed position in China 's border conflict with India ; Ceylon and Cambodia , both left-wing " neutrals " ; and Indonesia , which is hopeful of Chinese support in any future action against the soon-to-be-born Malaysian federation . <P> To Moscow 's consternation , the only Communist nation that has not yet spoken out one way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the $1,000,000 a day that Russia is pouring into his island commune , Fidel Castro is still angry over Khrushchev 's withdrawal of Soviet rockets last fall . Trying to make the Soviet leader sweat , Castro is obviously attempting to boost his price for supporting Russia in its struggle with the Chinese . But there is little doubt that Cuba will ultimately sign the treaty , for Castro needs Russia to buy his 3,800,000-ton sugar crop and to continue steady transfusion of economic aid . <P> The Lonely Ones . The sole nonsigner in the Western camp is France . Even Franco Spain , the only Western country which does not have diplomatic relations with Moscow , has signed the treaty , leaving France isolated from all its continental neighbors . Most galling to Charles de Gaulle was West Germany 's decision to sign the pact after a reassuring pitch in Bonn by U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk . Bonn 's action was doubly upsetting to France , for it followed an announcement that Germany and the U.S. will cooperate in the development of a new battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , Paris was unable to reach agreement with the Germans on a similar project .
