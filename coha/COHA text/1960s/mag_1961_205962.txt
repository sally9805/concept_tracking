The unbroken line of Popes from the Disciple Peter to John XXIII underlies the Roman Catholic claim to be the one true church of Christ . But it is a complex line to trace-as is demonstrated in the Vatican 's just-published , red-covered , 1,784-page Pontifical Yearbook for 1961 . Missing from the new edition is Pope Stephen II , making Pope John the 261st Pope instead of the 262nd . <P> Stephen , an obscure Roman presbyter , was elected Pope on March 2-3 , 752 , but two days later , before he could be crowned , died of apoplexy . His fierce face still stares down at worshipers in the central nave of Rome 's St. Paul 's Basilica , but the current Yearbook 's compiler , Msgr . Angelo Lanzoni , decided that papal coronation should be the criterion . <P> Most recent previous correction of the papal succession was in 1947 , when the Yearbook 's compiler decided that Athenian Pope St. Anacletus ( circa 100-112 ) and Roman Pope St. Cletus ( circa 78-90 ) were really the same man ; therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . St. Felix , who died in 365 , is erroneously listed as Pope Felix II ( 355-365 ) ; scholars still are not sure whether Dioscorus , who died in 530 and is listed as an antipope , * was not in fact legitimate , or whether Leo VIII ( 963-965 ) , the candidate of Emperor Otto I who deposed his predecessor , is legitimate after all . <P> A 12th century error inserted a nonexistent John XV into the reign of John XIV ( 983-984 ) . This error was compounded by 1 ) the inclusion of Antipope John XVI ( 997-998 ) in the legitimate succession , and 2 ) the fact that no John XV ever existed . According to these calculations , the present Pope John XXIII is really John XXI . <P> *A false claimant to the Holy See in opposition to a canonically elected Pope .
