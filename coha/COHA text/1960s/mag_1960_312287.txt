Ever since Christopher Columbus ' first voyage , Cuba has been a steppingstone to Latin America , and last week Nikita Khrushchev prepared to set foot there . Invited by Fidel Castro to visit Cuba , the Soviet chief accepted " with gratitude . " He did not set a date for his trip , apparently in hope of getting other invitations that would take him to the mainland too . <P> His chance of a warm official welcome elsewhere is slight . All the major Latin American Presidents-Argentina 's Frondizi , Mexico 's Lpez Mateos , Brazil 's Kubitschek , Venezuela 's Betancourt , Chile 's Alessandri , Colombia 's Lleras Camargo-are authentic , elected democrats , friendly to the U.S. and fearful of letting Khrushchev get a foothold in the Western Hemisphere . But though Latin America is gifted with many mature and responsible top officials , it also has masses of poor and illiterate people whose grievances can be exploited . From his platform in Cuba , Khrushchev undoubtedly hopes to talk to them over the heads of their leaders .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
