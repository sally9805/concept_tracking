txt The New York Times ' FOR IT . S. POLICY : Paul M. C. Hasluck , Australian External Affairs Minister . AUSTRALIA BACKS 15. - SAIGON STAND We 're in World Struggle , ' Foreign Minister Asserts , and ' We 've Got to Win ' By PETER GROSE Special to The New York Times SAIGON , South Vietnam , June ** Australian Minister for External Affairs gave blunt and sweeping endorsement today to United States policy in South Vietnam and the efforts of the Government here to defeat the Communist insurgents . The Minister , Paul M. C. Hasluck , dismissed proposals to neutralize Southeast Asia as " just an impractical dream . " He spoke at a news conference after a three-day visit . In a series of brusque and matter-of-fact replies , he placed the Australian Governmeat squarely behind United States attempts to show more flags of the non-Communist world in South Vietnam . " We 're in a world power struggle , " he said . " You 've got to stand up and be counted ? you 've got to say which side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and we 're going to stick to that side . " Australian Concern Shown For reasons of geographical proximity as well as solidarity against Communist expansion , Australia has shown particular concern over Southeast Asian developments . A team of 30 Australian military advisers has been here since 1962 , working alongside American advisers and South Vietnamese . This team is soon to be doubled . " If we were to lose here , that failure would have effects right throughout Asia and beyond Asia to many countries of the world , " Mr. Hasluck said . " If or when we win here , that success is going to have a tremendous heartening effect in every country of the world . This is something that 's vital to our side . " Mr. Hasluck was asked if he had been encouraged or discouraged by his talks with Premier Nguyen Khanh and other South Vietnamese leaders . He said he had been // " broadly encouraged , " but he added : " The point is not to say whether we 're encouraged or discouraged . The point is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed . We 've got to win . " United States diplomats have been trying for two months to enlist support from other Western and non-Communist nations for the South Vietnamese war effort . They want to make it look less like an American campaign and more like a nonCommunist-world commitment . Officials have called the response from many allies encouraging , but few have spoken so unequivocally as the Australian did today . Mr. Hasluck disposed of President de Gaulle 's idea . to neutralize Southeast Asia in a sentence : " It would not work . " Later he expanded as follows : " I do n't think , you could get neutralization of Southeast Asia in the present circumstances without yielding to the Communists , and I do n't think we should yield to the Communists . I do n't think neutralization is real politics . " I believe that in General Khanh , Vietnam has a leader of outstanding qualities . In my talk with him I made it clear that Australian support of Vietnam would be maintained . Australia believes that the struggle in Vietnam affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia as well . " Mr. Hasluck said that , besides doubling the advisory team , Australia was making arrangements to provide 20 army specialists as instructors in fields requested by the South Vietnamese . Australia has also agreed to supply six transport planes and crews in the next four months .
