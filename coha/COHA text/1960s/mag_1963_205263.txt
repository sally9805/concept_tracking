Returning home early from a party at the King 's residence in Vientiane . Foreign Minister Quinim Pholsena , 47 , and his wife drew up before their newly renovated villa . On guard was a protective screen of soldiers from the neutralist army of Premier Prince Souvanna Phouma . As Quinim mounted the steps , one of the soldiers stepped forward and fired a blast from his submachine gun that killed Quinim and seriously wounded his wife . <P> When word of the murder reached the King 's residence on the banks of the Mekong , it failed to dampen the merrymaking .

Unlike most other Laotian politicians , he did not belong to a rich or princely family .

Asked if he agreed that Quinim had been proCommunist , Premier Souvanna Phouma replied simply : " He is dead . Peace to his soul . "
