Two years ago , Soviet Poet Robert Rozhdestvensky , 32 , was the idol of rebellious Communist youth . Sharing a platform with Evgeny Evtushenko and other young poets , Rozhdestvensky declaimed against the cult of Stalinism . <P> How could we <P> An atheist people <P> Be servants of a cult ? <P> he cried , and the people cheered . <P> But Khrushchev said tut-tut to all that , and Rozhdestvensky rather readily switched his blank-verse sermonizing from anti-Stalinism to anti-Americanism . Imagining himself a U.S. Indian in wild West days , he asked : <P> What if . . . we should once more hear the warpath 's call ? <P> How the tomahawk would glint in the dew . <P> What scalps would steam in our hands . <P> Even steamier was a poem denouncing Russian-born U.S. specialists on the Soviet Union . Rozhdestvensky said that during World War II they joined the Nazi armies and burned villages , raped women , massacred the wounded , and <P> smashed the gun butts <P> down on the babies ' cribs . <P> Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges Soviet and U.S. scholars , Rozhdestvensky and four other Soviet writers came to Yale University , towed by Harold Taylor , former president of Sarah Lawrence College . Just as international fellowship was beginning to ripen , a chap burst in to charge the Soviet poet with " almost pathological anti-Americanism , " which he documented by quoting the poems . The rude fellow was Charles Moser , 29 , assistant professor of Slavic languages at Yale , and a graduate exchange student at the University of Leningrad five years ago . He argued that " to give the Russians anything more than the most reserved of receptions is to encourage those dedicated to the repression of any sort of liberalization in Soviet life . " <P> Moser 's call for a cold shoulder was cold-shouldered by most of his Yale colleagues . Robert Jackson , a specialist in Russian literature , called Moser 's statement " irresponsible , " and said that the university should be hospitable to obnoxious opinions . Even Frederick Barghoorn , who spent 16 days in a Moscow jail last year as an alleged U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful dialogue that explores rival opinions . <P> At first Moser seemed somewhat bewildered by the uproar . But he quickly recovered his poise , renewed the argument in a face-to-face showdown with the Russians . Soviet Editor Aleksandr Chakovsky , one of the party , protested-but Moser had already ticketed Chakovsky as an ex-agent of the Russian secret police . " I decided the attitude should be on the tough side of neutral , " Moser summed up .
