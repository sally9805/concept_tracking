Rumors swept New Hampshire 's famed Phillips Exeter Academy one morning last week as the school 's 766 boys were summoned to a sudden meeting . " The school is bankrupt , " some joked . " Girls are going to be admitted , " others hoped . When Principal William Gurdon Saltonstall , 57 , uncoiled his towering frame ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) and rose to speak , the news topped the rumors . <P> <P> " Life is unpredictable , " said Saltonstall in his laconic way . " In sailing terms , we sometimes come about and start on a new tack , or as in this case , we jibe over sharply to an entirely different course . With the greatest reluctance , I plan to resign as principal of Exeter at the end of the school year . " <P> In just six days Saltonstall had decided to break his 31-year career at Exeter and go off to run Africa 's biggest Peace Corps operation , which by fall will have 500 U.S. teachers in the schools and universities of Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' he said , referring to his yearly custom of a surprise holiday that the boys call Saint Gurdon 's Day , " but do n't you dare forget your old one . " <P> " Call Me Salty . " The Saltonstalls of New England are as prominent as their long noses and square jaws . They started being Boston Brahmins in 1630 , when Sir Richard , a former lord mayor of London , arrived on the ship Arbella and founded what is now the Boston suburb of Watertown . Also on the Arbella was the Rev. George Phillips , forebear of the founder of Exeter , which in 1796 graduated , along with Daniel Webster , its first Saltonstall , Leverett , ancestor of the present U.S. Senator . <P> <P> William Gurdon Saltonstall himself went to Exeter , and was the tenth generation Saltonstall at Harvard , where he earned five varsity letters in crew , hockey and football . He joined Exeter in 1932 to teach history , and after World War II , in which he saw combat aboard the carrier Bunker Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946 he was so popular that hundreds of boys marched through the rain to cheer his appointment as Exeter 's ninth principal . " Call me Salty . " said he when the cheermakers stumbled over his name , and so they have ever since . <P> Salty 's wife , five children and inevitable golden retriever are all part of his headmasterly charm . A daily fixture on the playing fields of Exeter , he is famous for scrimmaging with the football team , skating with the hockey team , coaching the crew from his single shell on the Squamscott River . An avid sailor , he races off Cape Cod in his ancestrally named yawl Arbella . He may have slowed down a bit since 1961 , when a flying hockey puck almost blinded one of his eyes , but he still plays tennis and beats 90% of the faculty . <P> Academically , Saltonstall lets the faculty win . Given complete autonomy , Exeter 's departments produce strong minds and pioneering ventures ; the current faculty has more than 20 textbooks to its credit . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators : criticism for being indecisive . In contrast to Andover , its aggressive rival . Exeter has raised only one new building in 30 years . But it is a place of such impeccable teaching that last fall it got 73 National Merit Scholarship finalists , more than any other U.S. school . <P>
