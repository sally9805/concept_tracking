Atlast Come to Life <P> The greatest weight lifter of modern times , and one of the world 's most remarkable athletes , is a stocky , Sacramento-born Nisei named Tommy Kono , 29 . He wears horn-rimmed glasses , speaks with unfeigned modesty , and seems as innocuous as Clark Kent-until he takes off his clothes and sets to work . Then Kono becomes Superman himself . <P> Last week , at the A.A.U. championships and Olympic tryouts in Cleveland , Kono carefully put aside his glasses , chalked his hands , and approached the bar bells like old and honored adversaries . As always , his lifts were marvels of split-second timing and raw power . When Kono was done , he had hoisted a total of 865 Ibs. in three lifts to win his eighth national title , qualified easily to compete for the U.S. in the 165-lb. weight-lifting class at the Rome Olympics this August . <P> Kono virtually guarantees the U.S. a gold medal . Undefeated in world championship competition since 1952 , he has broken some 30 world records . Even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at will and still lick the planet . In the Olympics he won the 148-lb. class in 1952 , the 181-lb. class in 1956 . In non-Olympic competition , he set a world record in the igS-lb. class . <P> Now a resident of Hawaii , Kono was so asthmatic as a child that his worried mother tried such Oriental remedies as burning small amounts of fluff directly against his body . In 1945 , while he and his family were quartered in a wartime relocation camp , Kono began fooling around with weights , soon rid himself of the asthma , changed from a 105-lb. weakling into a genuine Atlas . <P> Confidence . To Tommy Kono , the secret lies in the power of positive thinking . " Successful weight lifting is not in the body , " says Kono . " It 's in the mind . You have to strengthen your mind to shut out everything-the man with the camera , the laugh or cough in the audience . You can lift as much as you believe you can . Your body can do what you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my opponent , even in a close contest . I never would say to myself , ' I hope he slips . ' That 's a negative attitude . Saying that , you 're relying on outside help to win . Praying does n't help , either . That 's also relying on outside help . The will has got to come from me , It 's all up to me . <P> " Just before bending down for the bar , I look up . That relaxes my back . I get the feeling that my direction is up . Then I grip the bar and take a deep breath and arch my back . Then I feel in the mood . I feel like a pouter pigeon . When I feel tension on my lower back , I rock backward , and the weight comes up automatically . I think of the steps , not the weight . Thinking of the weight would unnerve me . " <P> Doubt . A medical technician , Kono stokes himself on vitamin pills , minerals and protein tablets . To gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the menu from Chinese to Japanese to Italian to American . Bachelor Kono 's diligence draws high praise from Bob Hoffman , vice chairman of the A.A.U. weight-lifting committee : " Kono is dedicated . Others get married , bring their wives to contests . You ca n't win that way . If a wife is cooperative and accepts the fact that bar bells come first , a weight lifter might succeed . Otherwise , , there is no place for a wife in a champion 's life .
