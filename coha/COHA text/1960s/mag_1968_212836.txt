Just as sure as presidential candidates crop up every four years , so is Cartoonist Walt Kelly sure to needle them in his comic strip , Pogo . He is off to a fast start this year . During the New Hampshire primary campaign , he sketched Romney , Rockefeller and Nixon as windup dolls running off haphazardly in all directions-and in the case of Romney , backward . Last week it was Lyndon Johnson 's turn in the guise of a booted , bulbous-nosed Texas longhorn that horns in on a picture-taking session . " You gittin ' my good side , oF buddy ? " he inquires of the photographer . " Which side 's that ? " retorts an onlooker . <P> <P> Most newspapers seemed to think the caricature was harmless enough to be printable , but the Washington Evening Star did not . It dropped the strip for three days . As Managing Editor I. William Hill put it : " If someone wants to go after the President that viciously , it ought to be on the editorial page . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the office of the President of the U.S. deserves some dignity . " <P> The disappearance of the strip brought more than the usual calls of protest from loyal readers , who , says Hill , make up a " medium-sized , highly articulate , aggressive following . "
