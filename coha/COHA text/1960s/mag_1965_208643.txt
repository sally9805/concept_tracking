THE New York Stock Exchange 's new census figures show that one in every six adult Americans owns stock today v. one in 16 in 1952 . The number of stockholders in the past three years climbed by 3,100,000 , despite the market break of 1962 , and the ranks of mutual-fund holders increased 48% , to 3,200,000 . Reflecting the nation 's westward shift , California replaced New York as the state with the largest number of shareholders . Cities of under 25,000 population have the fastest-growing number of shareholders , minors are the fastest-growing age bracket in stock ownership ( total : 1,280,000 owners ) , and housewives are the largest group ( 51% of all stockowners are women ) . Commenting on these figures , Stock Exchange President Keith Funston said that most of the stockholders are not speculators but rather people who buy stock and hold on to it , thus riding out the market 's ups and downs .
