While chasing a grizzly bear one day in 1847 , Explorer-Surveyor William Bell Elliott blundered into a canyon that looked to him like " the gates of Hell . " Huge , spiraling columns of steam hissed out of the ground ; the earth trembled beneath his feet . " The Geysers , " as he named the hill-rimmed valley 85 miles north of San Francisco , is as awesome as ever . But its frightening bursts of steam are now being harnessed . The canyon is the site of the first commercial geothermal-power plant in the U.S. , and the installation has paid off so handsomely in eight years of operation that it has set off a small " steam rush " in the Far West . <P> <P> As old as the earth itself , natural steam is a familiar source of heat and power in countries as widely separated as Italy , Iceland and New Zealand . The renewed interest in the U.S. springs from a growing population 's need for more electricity . In some areas , geothermal steam offers a cheap , ready-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leaves no pollutants in the air . At The Geysers , steam-driven turbines produce 58,000 kw of electricity at a cost 23% below that of nearby conventional generating plants ; in a few years , the area could be producing almost 20 times as much . <P> Prospecting for Steam . The largest and most accessible steam fields are located west of the Rockies , where volcanic activity has brought molten , lava-like rock known as magma close to the earth 's surface . The 1,500 F. magma either releases its own trapped water as steam or , like a gigantic coffee percolator , vaporizes water that has seeped down into the earth . <P> <P> Occasionally steam emerges through fissures in the ground called fumaroles ( from the Latin word fumariolum ; meaning smokehole ) , and the simplest way to prospect for this geothermal energy is to look for such vaporous leaks in the earth 's crust . But in areas where the energy remains trapped underground , geologists must use more sophisticated techniques . One method employs infra-red aerial photography . Since the infra-red film is sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter in the picture . Another method measures the earth 's electrical conductivity , which increases with the presence of subsurface hot water . To tap the subterranean energy , engineers drill with standard oil rigs , going down as little as 600 ft. or as much as 8,000 ft. , the depth of the world 's deepest steam well at Salton Sea near Brawley , Calif . <P> The Monster . The job can be dangerous as well as difficult . At The Geysers , a new well erupted with such furious force that the scalded workmen were convinced they had tapped a live volcano . To cool it off , they pumped in cold water until a nearby stream ran dry . Then they tried a concrete plug , without success . " The Monster , " as they dubbed the well a decade ago , continues to spout .
