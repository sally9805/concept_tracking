EXXT . NIGHT . 1 . FOG AND MIST The SOUND of a motor . A echoes through the night . Gradually , there is a glimpse of lights , and soon a fully lighted and very elaborate large yacht ( preferably a reconverted U.S. Navy destroyer ) emerges from the fog . As the yacht comes into closer view , three or four tough looking crewmen , sporting tommyguns , rush to the rail of the yacht . The suspenseful MUSIC has a 1930 's movie flavor to it , as do the CREDITS which now roll . ( There is perhaps a foggy , light kind of theme song sung under ) 2 . VIEW FROM POV of the crewmen : Out of the fog , a small light appears in long shot , and quickly a speedboat appears heading for us fast . 3 . CLOSER VIEW The crewmen at the railing . One of them looks up towards the bridge and waves an " okay " sign . OUR VIEW moves with his arm and ZOOMS to follow it to the bridge .

Standing stolid as Buster Keaton in the back of the speedboat is a dapper , very well dressed man ( Silk suit , silk shirt , silk tie ) , carrying a gold-tipped cane . This is HECHY MARBOLI. 5 . NEW VIEW of the big yacht , as we move to it , and the three crewmen move along the railing to the boarding ladder . 6 . NEW ANGLE the speedboat pulls alongside of the yacht , and Hechy begins to board . He slips , flaying his arms violently , and he curses as one finely panted leg gets sopped in the water , and he is helped out by his pilot , and begins to climb the ladder .  --  3  --  INT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The general theme seems to be large beasts of the world , Most of the furniture , and much of the drapes and carpeting appears to come from some part of some animal . For example the arms of one armchair or more are actually tusks , and another chair appears to have at the base of its upholstery the ribcage of perhaps a wild boar . The upholstery too is from various animal skins . Even so , it is not a trophy room , but a fetish . The TV set , encased also in animal fur , is in a corner of the room .

It is a little awkward because Darlene , standing watching them from the background ( but out of ear-shot ) is somehow dotting the i of their jealousy for each other . Angie knows that Joe is her first love , but hope springs eternal . Joe , of course , knows that she 's slept with Angie , but not him . And she knows that they both know what they know . The contrast between the two men is blatant . Angie , the son of the past of her father ; Joe , the son of the future .
