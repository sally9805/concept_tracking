The mass-produced U.S. chicken that has made headlines by being kept out of Europe has also been making history of a sort down on the farm . This year the U.S. will produce a record of more than 2 billion chickens , enough to put two chickens in the pot of every family in the world . Today 's chicken growers are more industrialists than mere farmers , and they preside over a $3.5 billion-a-year business . They have learned the lessons of automation and cost controls so well that they now run one of the nation 's most efficient industries . <P> Short , Climate-Controlled Life . U.S. farmers produce a 31-lb. chicken in nine weeks with 8 Ibs. of feed-which is one-third less time and half as much feed as it took a few years ago . Mother hens set in climate-controlled rows while separate conveyor belts carry away their droppings and their eggs ( average per hen : 200 fertilized eggs yearly ) . Automatic incubators coddle more than 50,000 eggs at a time , radioactive isotopes trace what goes on inside chickens to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitaminized ( A , B , D , E , K ) and de-beaked so as not to peck at any other birds during its short life . <P> Most chickens are grown by such large companies as Ralston Purina or by co-ops of dozens of growers . But modern methods have enabled individual growers to become big . The richest and one of the biggest independent growers in the U.S. is balding Bennie Clyde Rogers , 58 , of Morton , Miss. , who has 6,000,000 birds under his wing and boasts that last year his several businesses grossed $40 million . Rogers started as a feed salesman , swapping his Purina chicken feed for eggs from hard-pressed farmers during the Depression and piling up wealth with dried eggs during World War II . Today he raises 1,000,000 chicks on his own land , and , like most big growers , farms out the rest ( to 220 contract farmers ) . The farmers get free feed from Rogers and are paid 1 to 2 a Ib. to provide chicken houses , land , water and electricity until the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their feet on moving belts in Rogers ' processing plant , the chickens are eviscerated at the rate of 208 a minute , and delivered around the U.S. in 144 Rogers trucks that are gassed up by the Rogers Oil Co . " Most everything in town I 've got my mark on , " says Bennie Rogers , who also chairs Morton 's only bank , owns its main stores and has 1,000 head of cattle grazing on 3,500 Mississippi acres that are enriched by fertilizer from his chickens . Rogers lives in a 25-room house and trades in his white , air-conditioned Cadillac for a new model every year ; but he is concerned over sales because the Common Market 's recent high tariff rise has cut his exports from 250,000 Ibs. to 15,000 Ibs. a month . Complains Rogers : " We taught them how to fry chicken , and now they stab us in the back . " <P>
