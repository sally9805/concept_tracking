( See Cover ) <P> Lord Home 's crest shows a salamander standing in fire . To his friends , it symbolizes his patient , outwardly phlegmatic disposition , not easily touched by the heat of emotion , danger or disaster . As the grim-faced stream of ministers came and went through the black door of No. 10 Downing Street , the watching crowds got no hint of crisis from Lord Home 's broad , boyish grin and jaunty stride . The Prime Minister-designate seemed serenely untouched by the jealousies and conspiracies of his riven party . As one Tory said not long ago : " He 's never scared . He just looks at you with that damn-your-eyes look and goes right on with what he 's doing . " <P> Home 's victory may prove to be Pyrrhic . As a millionaire , one of Britain 's biggest landowners , an Old Etonian , head of a family whose pedigree predates Magna Carta , he has inevitably caused the revival of an old argument : that the Tories ' progressive , democratic goals are mere window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Labor Party is already in full cry . Describing the Tory selection process as viciously undemocratic , the Laborite Daily Mirror wrote : " Butler has been betrayed , Maudling insulted , Macleod ignored , Heath treated with contempt and Hailsham giggled out of court by the jester in hospital . " Deriding the Tories ' " aristocratic cabal , " Harold Wilson last week took aim and declared scornfully : " In this ruthlessly competitive , scientific , technical , industrial age , a week of intrigues has produced a result based on family and hereditary connections . The leader has emerged-an elegant anachronism . " <P> Many Tories agreed . On the other hand , the ordeal undeniably produced a leader of courage and principle who believes , in Home 's own words , that the government should never be content just to do " what people will stand for , " but instead should unflinchingly " tell them what they ought to stand for . " Says Tory Backbencher Nigel Birch : " His clarity and integrity shine out , and that 's what you require in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show up Harold Wilson for a cheap crackerjack . " <P> Denobilization . The grey-haired , blue-eyed earl has none of the hauteur of many English noblemen , and he has a pugnacious streak that his fragile air belies . In the Cabinet and the country at large , Home 's blunt , hardheaded performance as Foreign Secretary has won him a degree of respect accorded to only one of his postwar predecessors , Labor 's late Ernie Bevin . Remembering Churchill 's innocence of economics and social problems , many politicians believed that Home-Sweet-Home , as Winston called him , could easily fill the same gaps in his experience .
