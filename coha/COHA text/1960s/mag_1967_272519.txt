To the twelve eager mountaineers who struck out last month to climb Mount McKinley , North America 's highest peak , the adventure did not seem too formidable . Since the first assault on McKinley in 1903 , only four climbers had died on its slopes , while more than 100 people have attained the summit . Thanks in part to the National Park Service , which firmly winnows some 300 applications a year , at least half a dozen expeditions annually make a safe and often successful try to ascend Denali-the Great One-as Yukon Indians call the mountain . <P> <P> Even so , it is no weekend hacker 's jaunt . Though McKinley does not pose the classic technical challenges of the great Himalayan and Andean peaks , it is nonetheless known for the worst mountain weather in the world . Soar ing 20,320 ft. into the subArctic sky , McKinley is exposed to 150 m.p.h. winds that batter the mountain 's upper reaches with sledgehammer blows and are even more fierce than McKinley 's 72-below-zero cold . <P> <P> Mindful of McKinley 's menace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen climbers 18,000 ft. high between McKinley 's north and south peaks . After Wilcox and his assault team scaled the peak , he set out with four weary companions on the long trek down . Seven others , including the expedition 's strongest mountaineers , opted to assault the pinnacle . <P> The high party had radioed that it had reached its goal when the mountain 's most fearsome weather struck . <P> Searing snow and seismic gales tore at them , and when Wilcox and his band , stumbling down to a prearranged meeting site at 15,000 ft. , waited two days without further contact with the higher party , an attempt to turn back was thwarted by the storm . After four more days , with supplies low , Wilcox and his group were in dire peril themselves until a party from the Mountaineering Club of Alaska came to their aid . After a harrowing nighttime descent , Wilcox swam four icy streams to reach the Wonder Lake ranger station , which sent a helicopter back to rescue his four companions . <P> Still lost on McKinley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , with the storm finally abating , Rescue Pilot Don Sheldon spotted a body near the 18,000-ft. camp ; two more were sighted later . By week 's end officials abandoned hope of saving the four other missing men . In one savage thrust , Mount McKinley had almost doubled its total recorded toll . <P> <P> Blaming serious tactical blunders and " fiendish " weather for what he calls U.S. mountaineering 's worst disaster , Expert Alpinist Bradford Washburn added : " It 's amazing more people have n't been killed on McKinley when you consider 400 are killed in the Alps every summer .
