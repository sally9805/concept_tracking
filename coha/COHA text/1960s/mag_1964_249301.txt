The Prize is the Nobel Prize . In this picture , based on Irving Wallace 's superselling novel , it is awarded to Edward G. Robinson , the well-known physicist . The minute the old dear arrives in Stockholm to get his check , he is abducted by some Russian agents who look as if they took sneering lessons from Little Caesar . Now get this . In the suite vacated by Edward G. Robinson the Russians install-Edward G. Robinson . No , not the same Edward G. Robinson . This one is a Russian ringer instructed to refuse the Nobel Prize , denounce the imperialists and defect to the East . Sneaky , no ? <P> Paul Newman , the well-known American novelist , is also about to be laureled , but he really deserves an Ignoble Prize . For several years he has been hitting the bottle harder than the Olivetti . He is about to take a crack at Elke Sommer , a midsummer night 's dream who works for the Swedish Foreign Office , when he notices that Robinson is not really Robinson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer but he is a Good American . Alone he takes on several dozen mugs from Moscow . They slash at him with switchblades , they pitch him off a skyscraper , they-well , frankly , they are deplorably inefficient . Newman survives . <P> The customers may not ; they are forced to swallow an awful lot of chokers . He : " Will you marry me ? " She : " Why settle for one dish when there 's smorgasbord ? " But now and then there are some funny lines . There is plenty of fast action , too . And there is Elke Sommer , a blizzard blonde who is just possibly the most important German export since the frankfurter . In Hollywood they call her Elke Seltzer , and she may put a fresh fizz in the neighborhood biz .
