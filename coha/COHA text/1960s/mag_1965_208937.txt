THE SUPREME COURT <P> Senate confirmation hearings ordinarily are fairly perfunctory . Not so last week when Abe Fortas , the President 's first Supreme Court appointee , appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee . During a two-hour hearing , he answered questions on a score of subjects , replied to some half-baked accusations . <P> " Absolutely Inconceivable . " Dr. Marjorie Shearon , a vehement anti-Communist from Chevy Chase , Md. , appeared as an unsolicited committee witness , declared that Fortas was once a member of the left-wing International Juridical Association , that " he has been significantly connected with Communists and Communist fronts over a considerable period of time , " and that " his connections were neither trivial nor casual-and I doubt if they were innocent . " Fortas replied that he may have joined the group while he was on the Yale faculty in the 1930s because " joining was easy in those days . " But " to the best of my knowledge and belief , I never attended a meeting or took part . " <P> Another volunteer witness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee as a junior reearcher in 1952 , claimed that while Fortas served as attorney for Owen Lattimore , he had " deliberately withheld " from Senate investigators information about a Communist at the State Department . " That is absolutely inconceivable to me , " Fortas said . " I have never , would never , could never , in any way , misrepresent directly or indirectly or by implication anything to a committee of the Congress or to a court-and I hope to anybody else . " <P> Nebraska 's Republican Senator Roman Hruska asked Fortas to explain his part in the Walter Jenkins case last year . Fortas recalled that Jenkins , then a top White House aide , had called to say he was in " terrible trouble . " Jenkins had , in fact , been arrested on a charge involving a homosexual act , but , Fortas said , Jenkins was so distraught that he could n't give him a clear story . " 1 could not get an answer , " said Fortas . " But I was desperately concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortas and Washington Lawyer Clark Clifford went to the Washington Star , asked the editors to withhold publication of the story " to at least give us time to find out . " The editors agreed , and Fortas said last week , " I shall always honor those men . " As for his role in temporarily suppressing the news , Fortas said , " I am not ashamed . I am proud of it . " <P> Exaggerated Claims . Fortas was also asked about his views on the running legal controversy over the rights of criminal suspects after arrest ( see THE LAW ) . Fortas declined , of course , to indicate how he might vote as a Supreme Court Justice . But he did say that " adequate opportunity by police " to question suspects " is absolutely essential to law enforcement . " Still , the accused must be " brought before a magistrate as soon as possible . " Said Fortas : " The great problem is where to draw the line . I could never subscribe to the theory that because a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favor . But because a man is poor he should not be denied the right to counsel . " <P>
