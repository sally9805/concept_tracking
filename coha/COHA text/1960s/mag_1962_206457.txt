For critics of television , the time has come to lower the general standard . <P> Almost everyone but Newton Minow and a small group of diehards have stopped expecting new Shakespeares , or even new Jean Kerrs , to come popping out of the tube . Occasionally , TV specials do dart guiltily into advanced culture , like the flashlights of burglars in the Metropolitan Museum . Prodded by Minow , the industry has raised its public affairs programming to an admirable level , as was evident last week from Oxford , Miss. , to Cape Canaveral . But people who really care about TV-the ones who habitually watch it-are devoted to the weekly programs that contain the real stuff of television : all the heroes , heavies and broad comedians in the great video frieze that might be called the Elgin plasters . TV fills too much time to be extraordinarily worthwhile in any but a small part of it , and this will never change . <P> Inspecting TV 's new series , which have nearly all been put on display by now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season is rather good . Responding to Minow 's exhortations , the networks have largely removed from the weekly shows the only really objectionable elements they once displayed-miscellaneous sodomists , dope-addicted teen-agers kicking babies , and so on . The overall impression of the new series suggests a great bowl of mentholated cornflakes . There are exceptions , of course , but most of the corn is healthy , the humor and situations are pugnaciously wholesome , and the killing is largely confined to historic battlefields rather than back alleys . The new material is pretty fair ; and if some of it is just no good , it is at least not bad . <P> The Sitchcoms . The best new situation comedy is ABC 's I 'm Dickens-He 's Fenster , a tale of two buddies ( played by John Astin and Marty Ingels ) who are construction carpenters with sawed-off brains . Both are bucking for foreman , but in the main they are slapsticking away with casual finesse . Dickens cocks his wrist to look at his watch and pours coffee into his lap . The laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one misses Charles . <P> Another good comedy is Our Man Higgins ( ABC ) , largely because its producers have persuaded Stanley Holloway , the original Doolittle of My Fair Lady , to play an English butler in an American home . Holloway is such a skillful actor that he can engage a line like this one and win : " Here 's your tea , madam . I had a bit of a time getting it out of those little bags you store it in . " <P> If Our Man Higgins seems a bit of a reach , it is rivaled by some of the most frantically contrived situations in the history of situation comedies . The hero of NBC 's Do n't Call Me Charlie is a young , handsome , naive , lovable veterinarian named Judson McKay ( Josh Peine ) who is drafted out of Muscatine , Iowa , and sent by the Army to Paris . The Charlie in the title is a colonel ( John Hubbard ) , who is the vet 's superior officer . When his girl ( Linda Lawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to ship the boy out-but no chicken colonel can dispose of the fellow who saves the parakeet that belongs to the granddaughter of an old man in blue denims who seems to have been scraped off the deck of a river barge but turns out to be the first cousin of Charles de Gaulle .
