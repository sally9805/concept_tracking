NEARING 65 , salty C.R Smith last week moved up to chairman-and still chief executive-after 23 years as American Airlines ' president . Succeeding him as president of the nation 's second largest airline : Vice President-General Manager Marion Sadler , 52 , a onetime teacher who joined American in 1941 as a ramp attendant . Tennessee-born Sadler , who holds a master 's degree in literature from Duke , had worked up to Buffalo sales manager when he was summoned to New York in 1955 on the strength of his sales-manual writing ability . In 1959 , he was jumped over senior executives to general manager , told to hold costs while American moved into jets . Sadler is holding American 's expenses to a 1% increase , v. an industry average of 3.5% , by pushing sales and by automating ground operations , revising flight schedules and working out economical maintenance . Sadler on weekends inspects American installations around the U.S. and , when he can , follows a Southerner 's fancy for pheasant shooting and a scholar 's interest in pre-Constantine Roman history . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lawrence Litchfield Jr. , 63 , the chairman of first-ranking Aluminum Co. of America . A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and Harvard ( ' 23 ) , he tramped the jungles of Latin America and Africa as a geologist in search of bauxite , learned to speak five languages and eat such delicacies as parrot soup , struck oil for Alcoa in Texas and along the way found time to be an athlete ( rowing ) , amateur artist , rider and hunter . Since he moved up from president last April , he has spent most of his time " thinking , talking and listening about marketing and sales . " Last week Litchfield raised hundreds of Alcoa products by 1 to 2 per Ib. to take advantage of a strengthening aluminum market . Competitors Reynolds Metals and Kaiser Aluminum quickly followed his lead-and then went one better by increasing basic aluminum prices by a penny , to 24 a Ib . Will the boost stick ? That depends largely on whether Alcoa and Larry Litchfield decide to accept it .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
