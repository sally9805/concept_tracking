Abstraction in art seemed to reach some sort of apogee when Kasimir Malevich painted White on White . But Paul Taylor , an avant-garde dancer , may have topped that ploy by choreographing stillness : he once fashioned a dance called Duet in which a cocktail-party couple stood stock still for four minutes . He has composed dances to the sound of rain , and he has taken a collection of human postures and set them to the chant of the telephone operator - " At the tone the time will be . . . " The whole thing lasted 20 minutes , longer than a good many of the audience . <P> But few , if any , thought of leaving Manhattan 's Philharmonic Hall when the Paul Taylor Dance Company made its debut there last week before a near capacity house . Taylor and his troupe set out to be cozily charming rather than abstractly far-out . The result was atypical Taylor , an airy dance frolic as pleasantly unpretentious as a gambol on the green . <P> In Aureole , the dancers are all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue . Taylor , a blond , blue-eyed matinee idol , looks as if he could double as a circus strongman , and the trio of girls accompanying him are Nereids in semidiaphanous slips . The dancers move like sails on a summer sea , now lazing , now racing , sometimes capsizing , then righting themselves as they catch each new breeze of improvisation . There is no story line whatever , but the mood is as artless as love . <P> Piece Period , the troupe 's second number , is a tart , witty spoof of people and places , Italian , Spanish , French , English , German . In one of its six segments , Dos , an adventure-bent minx , appears in a saucy blue corselet with a black lace fringe . She is hounded , and eventually grounded , by twin Mrs. Grundys in black mantillas who shadow her every move on angry little sandpiper feet , then go skittering triumphantly off , presumably to tell the neighbors all about it . <P> Although he studied with Martha Graham , the doyenne of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans toward the avantgarde , which argues that dance alone is the proper subject of dance . Its credo : the motion is the meaning . When Taylor takes a few liberties with this dogma , it makes for fine summery fun .
