txt Letters Letters - ALIENATION OR DISSENT ? TO THE EDITOR : In " The Elite of the Alienated , " March 26 , Professor Feuer attacked the vociferous antiwar intellectuals by implying that they- are basely motivated and untrustworthy . He cited attitudes once taken by comparable persons in support of Mussolini and Stalin and in opposition to America 's joining the League of Nations  --  without saying how prevalent these attitudes were in any particular circle . Let me mention some other examples . Intellectuals of the day expressed their alienation from their governments and probably ? from the majority of their countrymen in England at the time of the American Revolution ; in France during the Dreyfus affair and more recently during the Algerian War , and in this country during the McCarthy heyday . ? The . verdict of history is clear on these issues , and the three nations are honored by the record of the opposition . It is Germany 's shame that such voices were not heard in 1933-45 . DAVID E. HAFT , - M.D . New Rochelle , N.Y . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing the whistle on Diogenes , that early Alienated Intellectual who , as Professor Feuer so devastatingly points out , " rejected . . . family , vocation and material comforts " to seek truth . He is indeed the very archetype of the kind . of troublemaker whose reports from Vietnam are currently exhausting our deeply American patience . It 's time we cleaned out that whole rotten gang of descendants of Diogenes and the defenders of Dreyfus he identifies  --  and the sooner the better . The trouble is that , as he Ind*-. nantly notes , the Alienated Intellectuals mouth their unscientific ravings from a privileged " sanctuary in the lecture hall . " But ca n't we draw on the deep wisdom of our Vietnam policy here ? " no sanctuary " ? Certainly a few hundred pounds ? of napalm scientifically dropped in the Harvard Yard would do a world of cleansing . At the very least , it would create sufficient vacancies in the faculty to bring intellectuals more ' , deeply rooted Tin the American soil " back from the lonely reaches of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO THE EDITOR : The liberal-Intellectual community today certainly has many unlovely aspects , the arrogance and detachment mentioned by Feuer being the most obvious . They are still very antiCatholic , openly racist towards Germans , and less openly so towards other groups , such as the Trish in America . I am sure there are many like myself who for one reason or // // another must dissociate themselves from the liberal majority in the academic community . But Feuer misses the point in connecting Vietnam protests and doubts with ? this group alone . Surely they were among the first , and have made the most noise , but this matter is not another liberal hot-house product . Others not liberal at all in the doctrinaire sense worry about napalm , maimed children , and the whole question of American power in the world in a way that has not been the case since the thirties . JAMES D. BOULGER , Associate Professor of English , Brown University . Providence , R. L WHITE HOUSE WATCHER To THE EDITOR : Theodore Sorensen , the brief writer , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " The Presidency Is Beck-Breaking , But You Get to Walk to Work , " March 19 ) . I ca n't name a single pundit , politician , political scientist or participant ( to use Mr. Sorensen 's roll-call ) who is of the opinion . ( 1 ) that eight years is the normal length of time served by a President , or ( 2 ) that Vice Presidents who succeed to the Presidency because of their predecessors ' death automatically seek second full terms . Eleven Presidents , since Jackson , have served more than one tenon . Ten Presidents , since Lincoln , have served more than one term . ( Mr. Sorensen conveniently includes the eight Presidents between Jackson and Lincoln , all of whom served four or less years . ) Eight 20th - century Presidents , beginning with , have served more than one term ? eight out of 12 . Seven Presidents , beginning with Grant , have served more than seven years . Mr. Sorensen chose to go back 130 years in compiling his statistics , but the facts shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the 12 Presidents who have occupied the White House since the turn of the century , not one failed to win renomination excepting , of course , those who died in office . What it boils down to is that Lyndon Johnson is only the second President eligible for a term longer than " cight consecutive years " since the third-term precedent was set in 1940 by F.D.R. Truman was eligible for re-election in 1952 , but the ? wo-term amendment already had taken effect and he decided ( wisely ) to respect the spirit of the Constitutional amendment . TIM TAYLOR . New York . WHY THEY VOLUNTEER TO THE EDITOR : I would like to answer a question posed by Mr. Herbert Kohl in Natalie Gittelson 's article , " A Second Pair of Hands , " March 19 . He is quoted as tasking , " Are they School Volunteers really concerned about the outrage of the schools or are they applying salve to their own consciences ? Many of these women have money , influence and power that they could use more profitably . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools , Mr. Kohl must first understand who they ere . They are grandmothers and high-school students , firemen and former school teachers , artists and ballet dancers , parents of little children in the schools where they volunteer and parents of students who are away at college . They are women who never finished high school and women who are studying for advanced degrees . Their backgrounds and talents are as varied as the city 's population , but their motives for joining the program are similar . School Volunteers enjoy being with children and giving the direct service inherent in their assignments . The average dedicated School Volunteer is neither wealthy nor influential and has neither the ability nor the inclination to organize a " base of power " in the ghetto .

Levin To THE EDITOR : Readers of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various distortions in Bernard Levin 's article , " Bertrand Russell : Prosecutor , Judge and Jury , " Feb. 19. ( 1 ) Mr. Levin describes : " A War Crimes Tribunal , ' modeled on the Nuremberg Tribunal that tried and sentenced the Nazi leaders , which will arraign and try President Johnson , Robert , Dean Rusk . . . " This is Levin 's description of Lord Russell on the tribunal , based on Levin 's attendance at 5 , press conference which received the printed material containing Lord Russell 's views on this subject as follows : " The tribunal has no clear historical precedent . The Nuremberg Tribunal , although concerned with designated war crimes , was possible because the victorious allied powers compelled the vanquished to present their leaders for trial ; Inevitably , the Nuremberg trials , supported as they were by state power , contained a strong element of Realpolitik . . . . " Our task is more difficult , but the same responsibility obtains . , We do not represent any state power , nor can we compel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand accused before us . We lack force majeure . The procedures of a trial are impossible to implement , . I believe that these apparent limitations are , in fact , virtues . We are free to conduct a solemn and historic investigation , uncompelled by reasons of state or other such obligations . " ( 2 ) Levin presents the press conference inaugurating. the tribunal as follows : " We are looking eagerly about for some of the celebrated people who , according to the list we have been provided , are to sit on this tribunal and sternly judge the malefactors . Jean-Paul Sartre , for instance , where is he ? " Jean-Paul Sartre was absent owing to the fact that he was organizing a press conference in Paris on this same War Crimes Tribunal , attended by Simone de Beauvoir and Laurent Schwartz . This was announced at the press conference simultaneously with the fact that Sartre had been elected executive president of the tribunal during the four days of sessions in London , in which he was a participant . ( 3 ) Mehmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party " ; he is its president , and president of the Turkish Jurists ' Association . Kinju Morikawa is co-president of the Japanese Civil Liberties Union , not merely " of the Japanese Committee for the Investigation of U. S. War Crimes . " Vladimir Dedijer does not " now prefer to live outside Yugoslavia . " His permanent residence is Ljubljana. ( 4 ) Levin states : " There is a brief announcement to the effect he will now leave , and he does , oblivious of the protests of those who have been brought here under the impression that Bertrand Russell was to give a press conference . " The press conference concerned was by invitation only . The invitation card stated : " Bertrand Russell will make an opening statement and questions will be answered by members of the tribunal . " The " anticlimax " was two hours long . ( 5 ) The New York Times succeeded in finding a photograph of Lord Russell which shows , indeed , a man looking tired . It may be of interest to mention that Bertrand Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Vietnam , that he presided as president with an hour 's speech . That afternoon , the entire conference adjourned to the demonstration in Trafalgar Square in support of the seamen 's strike and Lord Russell participated . He is 94 , despite Which fact he takes full part in public activities of this kind and gives interviews continually to journalists and to television . There are other pictures of Lord Russell at Trafalgar Square on that day which you seem to have rejected . I can=not but note your standards and your sense of fair play . ( 6 ) Levin writes : " He retails every charge he reads or hears in any quarter , however suspect , of atrocities alleged against American soldiers , including such actions as ripping open the stomachs of pregnant women and exhibiting theirunborn children , as well as putting eight million South Vietnamese into concentration camps . At times , indeed , insane paranoia appears to be hovering uncomfortably close . " The first statement quoted by Levin is from the antiCommunist Democratic party of Vietnam White Paper , submitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic party of Vietnam leader to The Dallas Morning News , Jan. 1 , 1963 . The second citation refers to a quotation in Time magazine , ' May 17 , 1963 : ' , Already eight million villagers-59 per cent of South Vietnam 's population  --  are living in the 6,000 hamlets so far completed. ? The basic element of the Government 's battle plan is to resettle almost the entire rural population in 12,000 ' strategic hamlets ' with bamboo fences , barbed wire and militiamen . " ( 7 ) Levin states : " In his attitude to the Warren Report lies one of the darkest elements in Russell 's tragedy . It is not that he refuses to accept the Warren Commission 's findings , but that he issued a violent attack on the report when it was published . . . without , as he subsequently admitted , having read it . " The report was not only read by Lord Russell , but  --  so far from admitting the slander written by Levin  --  Lord Russell has obtained printed apologies from newspapers which have repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Warren Commission Report , which bad been provided him by Mark Lane . Many people ... now acknowledge Bertrand Russell 's courage and foresight in criticizing the Warren Report and supporting- Mark Lane from the beginning . ( 8 ) With respect to the tribunal ? dependent , according to Levin , on my visit to North Vietnam to gather evidence ? it may be noted that six investigating teams , containing surgeons , biochemists , lawyers , directors of clinics and hospitals , trade-union executives and journalists , have been , and are , going to Vietnam for the tribunal . There are other inaccuracies and distortions in Mr. Levin 's article . I shall not deal with his language or his malice , for I am confident that these speak for themselves and will be understood by all fair-minded people for what they are . Mr. Levin is aware that I travel 60 to 70 per cent of my working time , which I think suffices for his various aspersions about my relationship with Lord Russell . It is extraordinary to me that The New York Timesis so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of printing and sponsoring an article of the intellectual and moral level of Bernard Levirt 's contribution . RALPH SCHOENMAN . London , England . ? Bernard Levin replies : " ( 1 ) The suspension dots in the middle of Mr. Schoenman 's quotation hide his careful omission of the following key passage : ' Despite these inhibiting factors , which call in question certain of the Nuremburg procedures , the Nuremburg Tribunal expressed the sense of outrage , which was virtually universal , at the crimes committed by the Nazis in Europe . Somehow , it was widely ? felt , there had to be criteria against which such actions could be judged , and according to which Nazi crimes could be condemned . Many felt it was morally necessary to record the full horror . It was hoped that a legal method could be devised , capable of . coming to terms with the magnitude of Nazi crimes . These ill-defined , but deeply felt , sentiments surrounded the ? Nuremburg Tribunal . ' " In addition , Lord Russell has said : ' In holding a War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is analogous to the circumstances which made necessary the Nuremburg trials . ' " Furthermore , Lord Russell has said : ' The , precedent of Nuremburg has direct ? elevance to our present situation . ' " ( 2 ) Mr. Schoenman 's point is wholly irrelevant . I did not say that Sartre 's presence at the press conference had been promised , merely that we had been told that he was to sit on the tribunal . Incidentally , the details of his part in the proceedings were not ' announced ' at the press conference ; they were extracted by persistent questioning . " ( SA ) Mr. Aybar is , as I correctly stated and as Mr. Schoenman needlessly confirms , of the Turkish Workers ' party . I made no reference , direct or indirect , to his position in that party . " ( B ) Mr. Morikawa , is , as I correctly stated , the secretary general of the Japanese Committee for the Investigation of U. S. War Crimes . I did not use the word ' merely , ' which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have already apologized in these columns for the sole error in my article  --  my failure to note that Mr. Dedijer has now returned to Yugoslavia . I added my regret that he has seen fit to make his peace with the authorities there . " ( 4 ) No invitation card was sent to me , and it is untrue that the conference was ' by invitation only . ' I , and others , - telephoned to ask if we might come , and were told we could . The majority of those present were clearly under the impression that Bertrand Russell was to give a press conference , and would certainly not have come to hear one given by Mr. Schoenman  --  which is virtually what it turned out to be . " ( 5 ) I did not select the photograph in question . But in the first place , I emphasized that there ? was no apparent diminution of Lord Russell 's faculties : and in the second place , the excellent photograph which accompanied my article did not make Lord Russell look tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lordship not merely retails these charges , but distorts them in the retailing , Mr. Schoenman strengthens , my case against Lord Rrgrell . Even Mr. Schoenman should appreciate the difference between a concentration camp and a settlement with protection ? designed to keep Mr. Schoenman 's friends out . " ( 7 ) Mr. Schoenman has been peddling this story for some time and , as he indicates , a number of newspapers have been so gullible as to swallow it . But in an article in The Daily Worker , London , on Oct. 10 , 1964 , Russell admitted of his original attack on the Warren Commission that it was ' based upon the summary and conclusions of the Warren Commission Report ' This ' summary and conclusions ' was a ' short digest , issued simultaneously as a press handout ; it is approximately 3% per cent of the length of the report . " ( 8 ) I did not say that the tribunal was dependent on Mr. Schoenman 's visit to North Vietnam to gather evidence . I simply recorded the fact that he bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his was to be the general standard of objectivity in evidence-gathering , the trlimnal 's proceedings could be taken as read . As indeed , they can . "
