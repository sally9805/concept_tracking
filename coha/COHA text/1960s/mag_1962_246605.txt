If a Man Answers . " If you want a perfect marriage treat your husband like a dog . " That 's what Mother ( Micheline Presle ) says , and Mother , one of those cocksure Frenchwomen , means literally what she says . When her daughter ( Sandra Dee ) gets married , she gives her some bitchy advice : " Husbands often leave home , pets never . And remember , a well-trained pet is happier . " <P> Yes , but how can the girl make woman 's best friend out of the curly haired wolf ( Bobby Darin ) she is wed to ? Easy . She scratches him behind his ears , lets him run on a nice long leash , dresses to bring out the Pinscher in him , feeds him plenty of pink meat and hot mush , gives him a good warm place to sleep . Pretty soon she has trained the poor yap to fetch , carry , make spaniel eyes , sit up and beg for his supper and think all the while what a lucky dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife has deliberately turned him into a lap dog , and he sets up a terrible howl . " I am a hunter , " he snaps at his spouse as he leaves the house , " and I still have n't forgotten how to point ! " <P> " Mother ! " the wife gasps , " what shall I do ? " Mother smiles that shrewd little smile the French always smile when they talk about sex , the one that means : I 'm so glad you asked me that , because now I can show you how horribly knowing and worldly wise I am . " Get a lover , " Mother says , " or better still , invent one-like I did . I sent myself flowers and got my girl friends to call me . If a man answers . <P> <P> I said , hang up . It 's the click that drives husbands mad . " <P> It 's what does n't click that drives moviegoers mad , and too many things in it do n't click-loud . The dog bit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actress Dee , who are Mr. and Mrs. in real life too , just sort of stand there most of the time and look like Tweedle Dumb and Twiddle Dee . And the production , like all of Ross Hunter 's productions ( Pillow Talk , Midnight Lace ) , is in the cheapest kind of expensive bad taste . It 's the sort of picture , in short , in which the heroine wears 32 costumes but only one expression : goo-goo eyes .
