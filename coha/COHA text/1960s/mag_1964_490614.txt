Notes and Comment TO celebrate the New Year and the imminence of the New York World 's Fair 1964-1965 , we have spent some time pondering the Fair 's themes ? " man 's hopes and aspirations for ' peace through understanding ' and his achievements in a shrinking globe and an expanding universe " ? and assembling certain preliminary data on the Fair that have caught our fancy . We have learned that last April a Minnesota congressman presented Robert Moses with a walleyed pike , a symbol of the state , and that the Hawaiian whose theme is " The Spirit of Aloha , " will be serving a three-hour , ten-dollar luau that includes young pig roasted on hot bricks . In the pavilion of Argentina , besides cultural and inclusRtr. ial exhibits , there will be whole Argentine steers roasted on a wheel rotisserie . To further illustrate man 's hopes , aspirations , and achievements , there will be a simulated trip to the moon , by Cincrania ; a display of dream cars called Mustang , Allegro , and Cougar II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Walt Disney , who has also constructed an animated Abraham Lincoln for the Illinois Pavilion ; and replicas of the Santa Maria , the Spirit of St. Louis , a Mississippi River showboat , the Mercury and Gemini space capsules , and the heads of Holofernes and St. John the Baptist . The Wycliffe Bible Translators , Inc. , will display " an heroic mural depicting the conversion of a tribal chieftain from a head-hunter to an influential Christian citizen , " and the Atomic Energy Commission is sponsoring a children 's exhibit called Atomsville , U.S.A. , where answers to pertinent questions may be obmined " when the youngsters press but tons , push levers , and otherwise activate various displays . " Although the Communist countries and the Virgin Islands will not be participating in the Fair , there will he exhibits by the Republic of China , Mali , Austria , and the Continental Circus Follies . In October , H. L. Hunt , the conservative Texas millionaire who was to have sponsored . an H. L. H. Fun &; Food amusement park at the Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Robert Moses . In December , however , George Murphy , the producer of the Hollywood Pavilion , announced that he would be a conservative Senatorial candidate in the coming California Republican primary . In November , James A. Wechsler , in his column for the Post , complained that there were too many pictures of Robert Moses in the current Fair Progress Report . Mr. Moses , in December , spoke out against " captious criticism , random charges , nasty insinuations , and threats of investigations and politically motivated attacks . " Mr. Moses added that in the face of criticism " I revert to the classics of my youth and recall that Homer , with a wink of one of his blind eyes , once remarked hopefully that someday , in retrospect , even these trials may look good to you . " We , in turn , remembering the six hundred and forty-six acres covered by the Fair , revert to the official World 's Fair song , in which Richard Rodgers exhorts hopefully : " Pick up your left foot . Pick up your right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun time , you are entitled to it , Fair is Fair . " We already own three World 's Fair ashtrays and a set of World 's Fair table mats . Boleding WHEN we come into the office in the morning , we 're never sure what we 'll find on our desk . Recently , we were confronted with a message that read , " Times Square Lanes -- Thursdays at midnight . Watch actors bowl . " Sensing the possibility of high adventure , we sharpened a pencil or two , found a clean notebook , and set off to case the situation . The Times Square Lanes , we discovered , are on the second floor of a building that spans the block between Forty-second and Forty-third Streets on Broadway , and there is an elevator from the ground floor to the alleys . When we returned , the following Thursday , exactly at midnight , the elevator was n't running , so we bounded up a stairway , to find ourself in a vast , dimly lit room full of bowling alleys . Once our eyes had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a group of attractive-looking people milling around , burdened with howling balls and bowling shoes . " What alley is Never Too Late ' one " someone asked Not knowing the answer , we countered with a question of our own . " Who is that girl carrying the howling ball on her head ? " we asked , in reference to an attractive girl who was wearing a well-tailored pair of blue jeans and a pumpkin-colored shirt , and who was indeed carrying a howling ball on her head , as if it were a Grecian urn . " That 's Liz Ashley , from ' Barefoot in the Park , ' " we were told , " and she 's wearing the same shirt she had on in the picture that was on the cover of Life . " Miss Ashley took the ball off her head and walked a few gingerly steps forward to the foul line . She deposited the ball gently on the alley , and it rolled down toward the pins in a slow , graceful arc . It just caught a corner pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the feeling , " said Miss Ashley , turning around . " Nice curve , that , " said a bright English male voice next to us . We inquired whether he was on Miss Ashley 's tram , and he told us that he was bowling for the " Chips with Everything " Team II . " Our main job is to beat ' Chips ' I , " he added . We asked if he could tell us more about what was happening , and he pointed out a serious-looking man who was carrying a large sheaf of papers . " That 's Mr. John Effrat , " he said . " He can tell you anything you want to know . " We introduced ourself to Mr. Effrat , who , it turned out , is the commissioner of the Broadway Show League . He told us that for the past ten years the League has run sporting activities for people working in Broadway  --  and , more recently , Off Broadway  --  shows . In the spring , there is a softball tournament , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-fledged winter bowling tournament . Mr. E. went on to say that twelve shows are participating , but that since both " Chips " and " Oliver " have two teams , there are fourteen teams in all . Each team , which consists of five bowlers , is supplied with howling shirts in the team colors and bearing the name of the show concerned across the back . There will be prizes fur the winning team at the end of the tournament , Mr. E. said , but he would n't say what they are . " The kids seem to be having a great time , " he added . " They 're just practicing tonight . John De Martino , the professional at the alley , has been giving some lessons in howling tech niques to anyone who wants them . " We thanked Mr. Effrat and went hack to watch the bowlers . We heard a round of polite cheering from a nearby alley and cries of " Nice work , Albert ! " There , as big as life , was Albert Finney , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweater . He was smoking a cigar and taking swigs from a bottle of beer on a small table next to him . He seemed in splendid form , and broke into a broad grin whenever one of the members of the " Luther " team made an especially good shot . " You 're up , Albert , " one of Mr. Finney 's teammates said , and Mr. Finney took careful aim and let fly . Pins scattered , and Mr. Finney broke into another grin . Mr. Effrat came by and said , " See how the kids are enjoying themselvesF " ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE ( Time Out for the Elves Division ) : Bonwit Teller is offering shoes with a label that reads , " Man-Made Innersole . " President Brewster WE first met Kingman Brewster , Jr. , who is now the seventeenth president of Yale , at a dinner in the Peabody Museum a couple of years ago , when , under the late President Whitney Griswold , he was the University 's provost , and the other day we met him again , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . He and his wife had come to town the night before , to dine with Lillian Hellman , who is a Martha 's Vineyard summer neighbor of theirs , and some other friends ; Mrs. Brewster was staying over to do some shopping , and her husband had suggested , when we requested a presidential chat , that the chat take place during his drive hack to New Haven . When we met him in the lobby , he was accompanied by James B. Baker , a Princeton man who is Whitney Griswold 's son-in-law , The three of us walked a Mock west to a garage , where we hoarded the University 's presidential car  --  a Rover bearing plates that spelled out " YALE " ? and Brewster took the helm . " I recently cut short a vacation trip to Italy because of the Fred Barghoorn business , " Mr. Brewster said as he drove toward the Trihorough Bridge . " The faculty and the students did a superb job of organization to get him out of Russia , and when a protest rally that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to join the party . I did n't have a thing to do with the strategy of release . " " Turn right on Ninety-sixth Street , " Mr. Baker directed , and Mr. Brewster , having done so , went on , " What Whit Griswold said about this job is true : it follows you like a shadow  --  often a pleasant shadow . My wife and I went to Ravello , and no sooner had we got to the Hotel Caruso than I received a letter from a lady living in the neighborhood that read , ' My husband is away , but he is a Yale man and I know he would want me to invite you to lunch . ' " Mr. Brewster is a Yale man , class of 1941 , and we asked him what led up to all this . " I was brought up outside Boston , " he replied . " My father was a lawyer My parents were divorced when I was young , and my mother , who was , and is , a marvellously speculative and philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music at Harvard . Our household was full of stimulating people . I went to the Belmont Hill School , where I did all the things a future campus politician does , such as debating and working on the school paper . I guess I was a premature world-saver in my teens , because in the middle thirties I spent a lot of time at Ford Hall Forum , in Boston , where no idea for the salvation of the world was considered too far nut to deserve an audience . In my junior year in high school , at my family 's suggestion , I tutored so as to skip senior year and thus be able to go abroad with them during my stepfather 's sabbatical . Well , they went that summer-1936 ? along with my sister , who had just graduated from Smith , but I had written Senator George W. Norris , of Nebraska , a letter saying I 'd he glad to help him run for reFlection , so I stayed here to see what would happen . My offer was accepted in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker said as we gained the bridge toll station . " I then endured a very long and lonely train trip to Lincoln , Nebraska , " Mr. Brewster said as he paid up . " I arrived there , very much alone , bought a copy of the Lincoln Star , and read in it , in an article about Norris 's campaign , Kingman Brewster , prominent Massachusetts Republican , will also speak on the Senator 's behalf . ' I got a room at the Cornhusker Hotel and went down to the Senator 's office . His secretary was a nice old lady . A look of amazement crossed her face when she saw me . I was seventeen and was having trouble with my complexion . The shock and surprise percolated on and up in the organization . I moved to the Y.M.C.A. and worked in the office for the remaining six weeks of the campaign , licking stamps , and so on . The Senator won handily . I left right after the election and joined the family in Europe . " It began to snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went up the Bruckner Boulevard Ex tension . " We lived in Oxford in the fall , " he said . " Around Christmas , we went to the Continent . It was the hottest period of the Spanish Civil War . Later , when Mussolini had just threatened to throw a blockade across the Mediterranean , we took a cruise to Greece . For a while , the year before the Anschluss , I lived in Austria with an Austrian family . I am sure that all that period was enormously valuable . It made things meaningful to me when I got to college . " After Mr. Baker had directed his father-in-law 's successor safely to the Connecticut Turnpike , Mr. Brewster said , " Whit was a dozen years ahead of me at college , but I met him just before I went there , and I so w him a lot when I was a student . Our families were friends , and he was an assistant professor . We later became summer neighbors at Martha 's Vineyard . We discussed Yale constantly , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law School , he asked me to become provost . I decided on New Haven because he had asked me , and because of my feeling for him . " " Money , " Mr. Baker said as the Greenwich toll station came in sight , and he handed Mr. Brewster a coin , We urged the senior Mr. B. to backtrack to 1941 , and he said , " I went to Washington that fall to work for Carl Spaeth , as special assistant coordinator  --  for economics in the Office of Inter-Ameiican Affairs . I 'd become an overnight expert on Latin-American affairs by taking a seminar at Williamstown . After Pearl Harbor , I learned to fly , at the Navy 's expense . I was on antisubmarine patrol in the North and South Atlantic , but I never saw a submarine . I entered Harvard Law after the war . I had no intention of practicing . I wanted to save the world , and I knew that if ) ou go into politics and public affairs you always have to deal with lawyers , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , so , in self-defense , you become a lawyer , too . I also wanted to get the rust off my wheels after four years  --  four unthinking years . Carl Spaeth advised me to go to a major law school . ' You 'll find yourself in the company of people who play a significant role in things , ' he said . I think this is still true . I became fascinated with the law as an instrument of pub-lic policy . Law school was a great experience . 1Ve were all four or five years older than normal ; most of us , including me , were married ; and because of these two facts , members of that generation in graduate and professional schools were much more likely than usual to have friends ; ind acquaintances outside their own fields , and thus to see their universities as a whole . I wish there were some way of making that possible now . " " Money , " Mr. Baker said , around Stamford , and his beneficiary continued , " After graduating from law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then Milton Katz , who had been one of my professors at Harvard and was a special representative with the Marshall Plan in Europe , invited me to Paris as his assistant , so I took a year 's leave of absence from M.I.T. before being present . That was a marvellous year-1948-49 . My wife and I had two children  --  we have five now  --  and we lived out in a suburb near Saint-Germain . It was before the military aspect of the alliance became dominant ; working for the reconstruction of Europe had a great lift to it . " Mr. Brewster piloted the presidential Rover past the Bridgeport turnoff , and guided us , autobiographically , past a faculty year at M.I.T. and ten at Harvard Law , where he specialized in antitrust law and international economic problems and wrote , or co-wrote , a couple of books on these subjects . " How about Yale ? " we asked as our party got within striking distance of it . " It 's important for the head of an institution to find out what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of the institution are , or is , " Mr. Brewster said . " The big change in the postwar period is that all kinds of institutions and careers other than academic are now open to researchers and thinkers . Brains are assembled in industry and government . What 's special about a university ? The one thing we 've got and they have n't got is students . I believe in a faculty that teaches students . If you 're the kind of scientist who does n't want to bother with students , do n't come to Yale . If you permit the professorial label to be worn without the educational responsibility  --  let the faculty turn its back on the students  --  relief from teaching becomes a prestigious thing . Of the major universities , Yale is the most student-oriented . We have n't taken on a lot of peripheral activities ; everything is within walking distance . The fact that we 're not situated in an intellectual metropolis keeps us from being pulled apart ; everything revolves around the university . NVe 're not just a holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's not an easy situation , because the pressures of a complicated world are toward specialization. " 114r . Brewster turned off the snowy Turnpike into slushy New Haven , and said , " Another distinctive quality of Yale is that the identity of the college  --  the undergraduate college  --  has been successfully retained . Yale College has a separate dean  --  Georges May , who was horn in France . He 's a civilized , urbane , tough , compassionate man with a great sense of humor and no self-seriousness ; one of Whit 's great appointments ; one of his last appointments ; a ten-strike . And the Graduate School has a great dean  --  John Miller , an economist . The existence of the College contributes quite a lot to the Graduate School . Another thing : I think it 's easier at Yale than elsewhere for a student to have a foot in both camps  --  the scholars ' camp and the activists ' camp . it 's not on an either or basis . I think that 's good . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it gives us a special quality and function . I think this is a tradition well worth preserving . " Mr. Brewster , who had a luncheon appointment with Marcel Breuer , the architect , dropped us off at the Green , and we went to the Taft for a beer . ? IEITTER received from an assistant vice-president of the Animal In-surance Company of America , 52 Vanderbilt Avenue : DEAR SIRS : We regret to inform you that this company is no longer insuring animals and , therefore , will be unable to be of service to you . Ringer OUR man Stanley stopped by the office during the earlier morning hours of January 1st , blew a noisemaker in our face , posed the conundrum " When is a railroad station not a railroad station ? , " and deposited the following notes : " Rang Old Year out with tiny bell clasped in each hand . Found tiny bells on table at First Annual Bell Ringer Ball for Mental Health . Found First Annual Ball going on , for a scheduled seven hours , in transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand dollars an hour . Cost to bell ringers of Ball : twelve-fifty to a hundred dollars . Terrific experience . Only entrance to Ball through Vanderbilt Avenue doors of Pan Am Building . Proceeded through vast lobby of P.A.B. , closely observed by small battalion of Pinkerton police in parade dress . One guided me to smiling , youthful Filipino in colorful native shirt , who took coat , scarf , and one dollar , and handed out coat check and mimeographed slip . Slip read , ' We hope we can be of service to you and at the same time share some enjoyable moments with you in the spirit of friendship . ' Second Pinkerton pointed to bank of escalators leading down to station . Descending one of these , met strong gust of frigid air ascending . Also caught first glimpse of transformed station .

Big Ben all lit up . Kodak sign dark . All other ads all lit up . Noticed big bandstand with baby-blue canopy just below Kodak sign . Would colors have clashed ? Noticed tables two hun-dred and five of them , according to program  --  scattered around floor of station , each covered with baby-blue tablecloth and tiny hells . Bandstand mostly empty . Tables mostly full . Giant TV screen on top of New Haven ticket counter showing pictures of inside of station . D  --  j ? vu . TV picture switched to shot of Times Square . Not much difference , somehow . Mentioned this to red-coated waiter . Waiter disagreed . Boy , am I glad I 'm not there ! ' he said Suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trout wearing heavy overcoat , bolting cold , smiling . TV unit director jumped onto handstand , grabbed mike , yelled ' In a minute , we 'll he coast to coast ! ' Trout kept on smiling . TV unit director pointed at handstand . Bandstand emitted low drum roll . TV unit director pointed in other direction , at Track 24 . Sign by Track 24 said : 4:15 P.I5,1 " . SOUTH NORWALK LOCAL-EXPRESS " Big Ben registered 11:15 . Suddenly , canned music blared from hidden loudspeakers , and Guy Lombardo and Royal Canadians emerged from entrance to Track 24 . Lombardo had on red jacket , railroad conductor 's cap . So did Royal Canadians . Robert Trout vanished from TV screen , was replaced by Guy Lombardo . Lombardo smiled , coast to coast . " Led by red-coated waiter to Table No. 37 . Table No. 37 about two yards from Johnnie Walker ad , just by passage leading to Newsreel Theatre . Lombardo guided by other waiters to bandstand , where he began first medley with ' I 've Been Workin " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 . Icy blast from direction of Newsreel Theatre . Decided on panoramic view ; climbed stairs to Vanderbilt entrance of station , passing Table No. 108 , which , program told me , had been taken by New York Central System . Table No. 108 half empty . Panorama from Vanderbilt entrance breathtaking . Arrived just in time to see Kodak sign switched on . Scattered applause from floor . Colors did n't clash . Lombardo swung into " Swonderful . ' More applause . Lombardo walked to mike and said , ' Now everyone pick up those little bells , because this is the Bell Ringer Ball , and help us to play " Silver Bells . " Little bells made of brass . Big Ben registered 11:50 . Decided , on sudden impulse , to check on Ball-less lower level . Lower level looked surprisingly normal maybe a little more crowded than usual . Faint gusts of music sweeping down barricaded stairs from Ball . Burns policeman standing at barricade chatting with a passenger . ' What do they get for their twelve-fifty ? ' asked passenger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man patronizingly . ' Just free amusement and a seat at a table . ' " Scurried back to Ball . Big Ben registered 11:58 . Miss Jeannie Quinn , Belle of the Ball , appeared on stairs near Vanderbilt Avenue entrance to station and rang large Bell Ringer bell . TV screen showed ball on top of Times Tower . Everyone grabbed tiny hells , rang them like crazy . Twelve o'clock . Lombardo changed railroad conductor 's cap for party hat , played Auld Lang Sync . ' Miss Jeannie Quinn swotted at large bell . Ball on Times Tower fell from top of TV screen to bottom of TV screen . Tiny bells going lickety-split . At 12:01 , seven thousand balloons fell unexpectedly from ceiling of station , were pounced on , and exploded . Lombardo played louder . Robert Trout reappeared on TV screen , smiled , and waved .
