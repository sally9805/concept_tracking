It was a year to the day after the abortive coup that was meant to hand Indonesia over to Communism . Now the anti-Communist army officers who put down the revolt were preparing to show the nation just who had been responsible . Before a military court sat a lean little man whose only name was Subandrio . He had been President Sukarno 's Foreign Minister , secret-police boss and closest confidant . Last week Subandrio was on trial for his life . <P> The charge was treason , and the testimony proved fascinating . So nervous that he often mumbled incoherently , the once-glib Subandrio admitted to a secret meeting with Chou En-lai in January of last year , in which the Red Chinese Premier had offered weapons to arm 100,000 Indonesian workers and peasants . He also admitted that he had learned that the Communist coup was in the wind but neglected to tell Sukarno about it . Why ? Subandrio assumed that the President already knew . Besides , he confessed , " I have an inferiority complex about telling such things to the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Subandrio was not the only one on trial . The government 's real aim in hauling him before the court , in fact , was to implicate Sukarno in the plot . So far , Subandrio had managed to avoid this , but only barely . " It 's only a matter of time , " said a top government officer . " If Subandrio gets up and says he was just following orders of the President-well , that 's all . " <P> Sukarno had already been tried and convicted by the mobs that clogged Djakarta 's streets last week . Once again , the vocal anti-Communist student organizations ignored pleas of the generals to wait for the trial to indict Sukarno . " Court-martial Sukarno ! " cried the youngsters . They tried to invade Sukarno 's presidential palace three times , were finally driven back only when troops attacked them with fixed bayonets and rifle butts . <P> The events of the week had a visible effect on Sukarno . Although he still refused to condemn the Communists , he was nervous enough to allow in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what had happened last October had been " treason . "
