Eugene Carson Blake 's 1960 proposal to merge four major Protestant churches into one seemed a lightning flash illuminating a hopeful abstraction , an ex citing new vision . Now the Stated Clerk of the United Presbyterian Church sees his idea as more possible than before , more urgent than ever , and beset by subtle dangers . Last Sunday , shortly after returning from a meeting of the World Council of Churches ' Central Committee in Nigeria , he went to San Francisco 's Grace Episcopal Cathedral , where he had first called for a united church " truly catholic , truly reformed , truly evangelical , " and spoke his second thoughts . <P> Miraculous Renewal . Blake 's original idea was for his own Presbyterians , the Episcopalians , the Methodists and the United Church of Christ-who have since been joined by the Disciples of Christ and the Evangelical United Brethren-to undertake a series of theological conversations exploring the possibility of union . Two good omens for the future , said Blake , are the favorable response to his suggestion from those churches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible at the Second Vatican Council , which " has made more important and urgent the effort to unite major Protestant churches . " <P> Yet other developments , Blake said , may have diminished the prospect of merger , and he warned that " church union delayed is church union denied . " One is the tendency of U.S. churches to become involved in their own worldwide confessional relationships . The Episcopalians , for example , are committed to help weaker Anglican churches abroad through a " mutual responsibility " program that was proposed at the Toronto Anglican Congress in 1963 . <P> The churches ' participation in the civil rights revolution has united a wide variety of Christians committed to equal justice for the Negro ; it has also raised the threat of denominational schism between the socially concerned and those who feel that their church should stay out of politics . Finally , warned Blake , union is threatened by lethargy and by " an actual hardening of opposition to church union proposals " - most notably , although Blake did not say it , among Methodists . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " warned Blake , " to unite dying or faithless bodies , is not to produce a union in obedience to Jesus Christ . " Thus he argues that " we must be against any church union that is established at the expense of truth " - any union that denies the insights of " our several traditions . " Equally deplorable would be union undertaken in a spirit of " outmoded triumphalism " - seeking to dominate the world rather than serve it . <P> Finally , Blake declared that " we must be against any church union that would in any way threaten the ecumenical movement " or diminish the obligation to cooperate with the many Christian bodies-ranging from Roman Catholicism to Pentecostal sects-that would remain outside the merger Blake proposed . The only truly Christian union , he concluded , would be one undertaken in humility , mutual forbearance , and a genuinely selfless love .
