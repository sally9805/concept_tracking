London will also be the site of preliminary peace talks beginning this week . After more than nine months of fighting between Nigeria and the secessionist government of Biafra , the two sides agreed last week to meet there and try to pick a site for full-scale peace negotiations , probably somewhere in Africa . Any talks face formidable difficulties : Nigeria insists that Biafra rejoin the country and be split up into three states ; Biafra demands that it retain some form of sovereignty in order to protect its 8,500,000 Ibo tribesmen . <P> One good reason for talking now is that the war has reached an impasse . Nigeria 's superbly equipped army of 85,000 men has captured all but one of Biafra 's major cities , including the capital of Enugu , squeezing the rebel army of some 35,000 into an interior area only a third as large as the 29,000 sq . mi. that it originally held . Even so , because they fear genocide at the hands of the other Nigerian tribes if they are defeated , the Ibo stubbornly fight on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main port , and have fought a hard rear-guard action . Frustrated by its failure to win a decisive victory , the federal government has tried to break the Biafrans by stepping up its bombing of their countryside , using Russian-supplied planes and bombs and Egyptian pilots . <P> Last week , after a visit to Biafra to check on the extent of the bombing , TIME Correspondent Alan Grossman emerged from the embattled territory and filed this report : <P> Without prelude , the rapid approach of a loud , metallic whine overhead transformed normal activity in the township of Umuahia , which now serves as the rebels ' headquarters , into frightened cries and panicked running about . A few seconds later , a single low-flying jet plane cut a straight line across the town , releasing as it went six pairs of rockets . Two plowed caverns into the grass huts outside the Red Cross headquarters at Saint Stephen 's School , where schoolgirl volunteers sat outside preparing garri for the evening meal . <P> The teen-agers were killed instantly . After the raid , as I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Works dump truck had begun plying the streets to collect other victims . <P> <P> The scene I witnessed at Umuahia 's Queen Elizabeth Hospital following the air raid was repeated in nearly every Biafran town I visited . Under tall shade trees outside an already filled mortuary lay a score of corpses , including pregnant women and months-old babies , charred , disfigured and mangled . Amid the tearful cries of keening women , workers carried into the morgue mashed human fragments piled on stretchers , and limbs and torsos balanced on shovels . The next morning , clutching handkerchiefs over nose and mouth against the stench and carrying freshly sawed unpainted wood coffins , the families lined up patiently under the trees to bear away their dead for burial . <P> <P> Payloads Against Population .
