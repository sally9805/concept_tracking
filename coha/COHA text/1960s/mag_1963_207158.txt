" A hymn should be a prayer set to music , " says the Rev. Gerrit Barnes of Denver 's Christ Church ( Episcopal ) . " It should follow the idea of ' make a joyful noise unto the Lord . ' ' ' Ideas change about what is joyful noise , and what is just plain noise . Church musicians and their pastors are quietly revising the nation 's taste in congregational song , and in the process are consigning a surprising number of quaint old favorites to oblivion , while searching oblivion for revivable classics . Dr. Charles C. Hirt , professor of church music at the University of Southern California , calls it " a renaissance in hymnody . " <P> The chief targets of contemporary hymnpresarios are what they call " jiggy tunes " - the sentimental lyrics of late Victorian Christianity , with their self-directed emphasis upon individual salvation , and their grim and hypocritical portrayal of man 's sinfulness . Most clergymen today wince at the thought of having to lead their faithful in Rock of Ages ( " Foul , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I die " ) or Mrs. C. F. Alexander 's all too vivid hymn entitled The Circumcision : <P> By those drops , the first red rains <P> Bursting from thy bleeding veins , <P> Grant to us for thy dear merit , <P> Circumcision of the spirit . <P> Also going out of style are rousing but theologically unsophisticated Gospel songs , such as C. Austin Miles 's In the Garden : <P> And He walks with me , and He talks <P> with me , <P> And He tells me I am His own , <P> And the joy we share as we tarry there , <P> None other has ever known . <P> Like a Bride 's Trousseau . Most of these baroque horrors are gradually being dropped from congregational repertories and eased out of new hymnals . In England , Teacher David Holbrook and Composer Elizabeth Poston are preparing a new hymnal for use in schools ( every British school starts the day with a hymn ) , and so far have found only 100 usable songs from the 10,000 or so contained in seven standard English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out a new hymnal that left out such traditional numbers as The Old Rugged Cross and Nearer , My God , to Thee . In 1966 the Methodist Church hopes to publish its first new hymnal in 31 years ; more than one-fourth of the songs will be entirely new . The Lutherans revised their hymnal in 1958 , and the Southern Baptists in 1956 ; the Baptists ' publishing house , Broadman Press , plans to issue a new hymnal in 1964 for use by evangelical churches . <P> Dr. Deane Edwards , president of the 2,000-member Hymn Society of America , argues that " hymnody must be kept abreast of the life of the church . ' ' But in replacing Victorian flotsam , hymnal makers have cautiously steered away from abrupt modernization , or harmonies more discordant than Brahms 's . Instead , they have subtly blended , like the bride 's trousseau , something old , something borrowed , something new .
