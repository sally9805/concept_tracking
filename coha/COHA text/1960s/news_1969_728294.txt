txt Question : Was n't one of the primary failures of the administration in this first year its inability to overcome the appearance of being pro-Southern white and anti-civil rights ,  --  or at least dragging its feet on civil rights ? ' - Answer : Yes , I 'd agree . But ; there has been a real hesitancy on the part of the administration to raise the expectations of the blacks falsely . It 's our feeling that the blacks have a right to feel disillusioned about the disparity between what they were promised in the past few years and the results . So we have clelibeately avoided promissory language , feeling that only results will talk . And at this stage , , results are- not available . We have . tried to attack ' some ' of the root problems  --  not openly on ' a racial basis because the ' nioment.you label a program as racial it is rejected . But-we have begun to deal with some of the bask reasons for peciple being . unable . to cope with the conditions around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment , inflation , and the like . But we are not claiming results  --  not yet . Unequal argument This colloquy is reported in paraphrase , under the White House rule for what are called " backgrounders . " When reporters talk with high officials the result is not an equal argument . The reporters can and do raise the most critical questions they can muster . But the question-and-answer format leaves the officials with a good chance to state - their positions . - ? - : Hence , as , the - year- end approaehes , ? an opportunity ? for ? White House specialitts to argue back : on the ciVil-rights ' question Which is widely . considered one of their political w , eak spots . It Continued as follows : Question : Then you are not arguing that the black community is in a more conciliatory mood ? ? Answer : You have to distinguish between the rhetoric being used and the actual tides of public opinion . The polls and other survey data suggest that there has been a considerable lessening of hostility and the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear the cities apart and they did n't . Optimistic community The mood of the black community is complex , but it is one of the most optimistic communities in America . This could be partly due to its decision to take its future into its own hands . But it can feel that improvements have been made and are corning . We get just as much support from the black community on welfare and the Philadelphia plan as from elsewhere . They are sophisticated ; they pick and choose what they will support intelligently . Minority groups know the difference between cosmetic love feasts , between symbolic gestures , and the reality of how things are . You should remember that the Rev. Ralph Abernathy never got a foot inside the White House when he came to Washington in ' 68 . This time , he was brought to the Cabinet room and with his associates sat for , two hours with the President and others . They said afterwards that they were dissatisfied . Of course . That was expectable . But we had him in . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition . We knew what would happen when some authentically poor people came here . They raised Cain . But the result was not to increase tensions . On the contrary , it helped to ease them . Violent aims thwarted Question : Then why were you so rough on the protesters in the Washington ' Moratorium ? , Answer : I suggest to you that there was very much more contact than was reported . The cooperation between the government and the demonstrators was explicit . Question : In the Justice Department , yes . Answer : I ca n't tell you how ' many White House staffers were invited to the Sunday afternoon parties afterward . The cooperation was organized and extraordinarily successful between the administration and the leaders of the Moratorium . ? ? ? If I can pound on the table ( suiting the action to the word ) , the people who came here for blood , violence , and blackmail failed . Thump . ( Sorry , White House , we ca n't paraphrase the sound of fist on table . ) The walkie-talkie communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want ' to get out of line but the reason this was n't known was that it was not to the interest of either party to have it known . More dialogue will appear in subsequent dispatches .
