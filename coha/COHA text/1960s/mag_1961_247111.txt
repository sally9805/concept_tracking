Flowery Cuernavaca. an hour over the mountains from Mexico City , has been called " a sunny place for shady people " ; its ravines and ridges sparkle with the swimming pools and haciendas of the international rich , and the campesinos have learned not to be surprised at anything . But the goings-on in a 150-room stone and adobe villa across the way from Barbara Button 's $1.5 million place are causing talk . Some say that the place is a nest of Communists , some that it is a training center for an illegal Roman Catholic underground . The Red newspaper , Politica , charged that it was a " penetracin Yanqui . " And some of the inmates of Villa Chula Vista this week are not sure themselves what they have got into , or what manner of wild man is this dark , cadaverous Ivan Illich , who yells at them and lectures them , prays and plays with them , insults them and drinks with them . <P> <P> Ivan Illich , 35 , was born in Vienna ; his mother was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took a Ph.D . in history at Salzburg when he was 24 , studied theology at Rome 's Pontifical Gregorian University , and was ordained to the priesthood in 1951 . He came to New York City , became interested in Puerto Ricans . <P> <P> Who Hates Yankees ? Father Illich was sent to Puerto Rico five years ago , where he became vice rector of Catholic University and a monsignor . He lost the favor of Puerto Rico 's Bishop James McManus when he spoke out against the bishop 's order forbidding Catholics to vote for Governor Luis Munoz Marin ( TIME , Oct. 31. 1960 ) . Yanked home by New York 's Cardinal Spellman and assigned to Fordham University . Msgr . Illich wangled money and Fordham 's sponsorship for a project that he had been hatching for years : to train a corps of men and women to serve the priest-poor church in Latin America by living lives of work with the people . Too many missionaries from the U.S. have rubbed Latinos the wrong way , Illich feels , by their North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Msgr . Illich 's Center for Intercultural Formation opened at Chula Vista with 68 students-about half laymen and half priests and nuns . Only 32 survived the rigors of the four-month. $750 course and are ready for assignment by their sponsoring agencies . The attrition of five and one-half hours daily of language drill , plus lectures and discussions that may last as late as 2 a.m. , was only partly responsible for the high mortality ; Illich and his staff deliberately make the students angry , start arguments , challenge cherished beliefs . " I hate Yankees ! ' ' Illich may yell at a mild-mannered nun from New Jersey .
