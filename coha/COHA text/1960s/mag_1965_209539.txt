The White Devil , by John Webster . It was Shakespeare 's destiny to dwarf his playwriting contemporaries , which by no means makes them dwarfs . Webster , best known for The Duchess of Malfi , was a splendid poet who mixed beauty with horror . If he spilled too much blood on stage , he also drenched the boards with passion . The decisive motion in The White Devil is a plunging dagger , but its determining mood is an obsessive sense of evil . In an admirable off-Broadway revival in modern dress , the play leaps the centuries with ease-it is galvanically alive . <P> Webster 's hero-villain is a spleeny young opportunist named Flamineo . He is secretary to the Duke of Brachiano . To better himself , he plots the murder of the duke 's wife and his own sister 's husband , thus clearing the way for his sister to marry the duke . When his brother becomes squeamish about this short cut to success at court , Flamineo kills him , driving his mother mad . In Act II , Operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , in turn , killed . <P> This rapid pileup of corpses does not entirely evade the risk of becoming farce , a kind of Marx Brothers tragedy . But whenever the villainy threatens to become laughable , an authoritatively able cast keeps the drama under sobering control . Frank Langella makes Flamineo a smilingly , itchingly venomous blood brother to lago , and Carrie Nye and Eric Berry are absorbingly effective as the duke 's second wife and a corrupt cardinal . Director Jack Landau has given the play drive and fury by cutting garrulous speeches and eliminating intrusive ghosts . <P> In The White Devil , evil wears its proper guise , disguise-and deceit . The sinister masquerades as the pious . Murderers dress as monks . Treachery promotes itself as loyalty . Love is feigned , so is madness , even death . The last deceit-self-deceit-is stripped away in Flamineo 's final speech when he sees life as he has lived it : the consummate cheat , the ultimate vanity , the supreme counterfeit . At that moment , The White Devil becomes a tragedy of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
