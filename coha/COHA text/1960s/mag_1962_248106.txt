Cleo from 5 to 7 , acclaimed in France as " the most beautiful film ever made about Paris , " is a curiously , spuriously brilliant attempt to contemporize the legend of Death and the Maiden . <P> Directed by Agns Varda , a 34-year-old photographer whose first film ( La Pointe Courte ) established her as " the Founding Mother of the new French cinema , " Cleo tells the story of 90 moribund minutes in the life of a featherbrained Parisian canary ( Corinne Marchand ) who has just begun to peck the plum of show-business success . As the story starts , the singer is nerving herself to ask a doctor whether or not she has a cancer . Pale with dread , she visits a fortuneteller first and asks the old crone what is in the cards for her . Death is in the cards for her , and the fortuneteller can not quite conceal the fatal fact . <P> For the next 87 minutes , without waiting for the doctor to confirm or deny the prediction , the poor little canary flutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big black cat of Death . She flutters past a market , where carcasses of cattle hang from brutal hooks and the butchers inspect her expertly , as though she were a carcass too . She flutters to her manager ( Dominique Davray ) , a hard-faced businesswoman who comforts her meticulously but unemotionally , as though smoothing a 500-franc note . She flies back to her gilded cage in time to preen and twitter for the man who keeps her for the same reasons he keeps a second car : convenience and ostentation . Her songwriters arrive , and the canary mechanically warbles a few love songs she has sung a hundred times before without a pulse of feeling ; but suddenly now they crush her heart and she flies into the street again . Death is everywhere : in the broadcasts from Algeria , in the movie she drops in on , in the jaws of the street-corner showman who cheerily passes the hat as he swallows frogs alive . <P> So far so good . The cinematography ( Jean Rabier ) is imaginative , if sometimes cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoked . And the fact of death in the midst of life is realized with horrible power in the image of the filthy cancer hidden in the glowing girl . But the film intends to show more than this . It intends to show a crise de I'ame , " a profound transformation of the being . " It does n't . For one thing , Actress Marchand 's face is no more capable of transformation than a kewpie doll 's . For another , Director Varda suddenly twists the heroine 's harm into a happy ending which sentimentally suggests that every shroud has a silver lining . <P> Tales of Paris . Some things a girl just ca n't admit . Not in Paris . Not when she 's 18 , and the best years of her life are almost over . So Sophie ( Catherine Deneuve ) gulps and announces with a superior smirk : " Of course I have a lover . He 's terribly passionate . He makes me undress in the car , right in the middle of town , with the chauffeur sitting up front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And where do you meet ? " " Oh , " says Sophie grandly , " he 's taken a flat for us . " The enemy closes in . " Ha ! You expect us to believe that ? What 's the address ? " Sophie is superb . " Number Six , Place Violet , " she announces with a shrug . <P>
