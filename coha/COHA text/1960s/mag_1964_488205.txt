Sitting down to try to explain Lyndon Johnson is a lot like trying to shovel away a mountain , like telling how you know when it 's time to take cattle to market , like explaining when it ' ? tune to plant corn , sell stocks or buy real estate . This man Johnson needs a lot of understand-mg and a lot of mind reading , and they ' taught ' us at journalism school not to go into motives except when motives cut to the heart of the issue . But when we buck up against the breathtaking business of the election ' booth , picking one man of two to lead the ' country , maybe it 's time to talk of motives Episodes pulled from the files of memory may well be as good a way Stuart Long has reported Texas politics for three decades , he now covers the state capital for a number of Texas papers . He lives in Austin . as any to begin . And as one who has been an employee ( briefly ) , a volunteer worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outs with about as much of the time , I am inclined to reach to memory instead of analysis . The recent patraits of Johnson , painted in black or white , have none of the human ' gray shades which give life to a likeness . But all the while , one keeps recalling Clarence Darrow 's reminder that you should pass on others ' motives only when you know yourself why you do what you do . Here are a set of penciled notes of a meeting called in Austin . Tex , in late 1945 , just after V-J Day . Congressman Johnson flew down from Washington to call a meeting of the " leaders " from the ten counties of his 10th District , which was his first political love . He wanted them to tell him  --  and the federal government  --  what- they should be doing about the men and women coming home from the war . Johnson told the group that , first , it was a responsibility of free enterprise to provide jobs for the returning GIs . After that , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , he went on , if those three failed ' to provide the jobs and the ' housing for the returning servicemen and their families , it became a federal responsibility : Hungry babies ca n't eat States ' rights , Ragged soldiers ca n't wear local self-government . Sick , illiterate people ca n't cure themselves on a diet of free enterprise . The meeting went on all day . Johnson introduced most of the 500 present by their first names , and as he introduced them , he told what they had been doing and what they had ' accomplished in their communities . But all through the meeting , the Congressman was telling the leaders of his district ' that he was going to vote for federal programs if they were needed to create jobs and homes . It was n't long afterward that he did just that . We had a real housing shortage in Austin when the guys with their wartime brides and babies began to come home . There was an appeal to open homes and rent a room to a couple But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rugged free-enterprise lot , wanted no part of socialized housing , but we organized a veterans ' housing council Every morning we would hammer on the university officials with demands for acceptance of an offer from the United States to bring in barracks and convert them into apartments if the university would furnish the land ( it had several hunched vacant acres ) Every afternoon Johnson would phone to ask if they were ready to accept After about ten days of this , the regents agreed to accept sop apartments . Most of them are still there , providing low-cost housing these nineteen years for university students and faculty members and , what 's more important , making college education possible . Next in the flood of recollections is one that indicates what Johnson 's Cabinet members have learned by now : he wo n't be satisfied with anything short of a miracle from those he leans on , hires , or assigns to jobs . As a volunteer worker and hi my spare time , I got up a network radio show for his 1948 Senate campaign . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I look over the script even now it did sound pretty good . Johnson heard it and ordered it run twice more over the statewide network . When he came back to Austin for an hour between speeches , ten days before election , he caught the and issued this ukase : " That show was the best one ever written . Now I want eight more just as good . " He ticked off the subjects for the eight more shows , ? only two of which got to the air before the campaign was over . So it became my fault that Johnson won by only 87 votes . There never was a man as demanding on his staff . The folk who pay the salaries will get their 236 money 's worth out of Johnson 's hired hands . Johnson must necessarily be described as a vain man . Maybe it takes vanity to carry one to the top of the political mountain In 1948 , he came home to assay his chances for the U S. Senate seat which was being left open by W. Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 . Everywhere he turned he read signs that convinced him he could not win One night a group of us gathered to try to get him to run He said " no " and went to bed . We . sat and talked , eight of us , all convinced that former Gov Coke Stevenson could be , and should be , defeated Finally we agreed that John Connally should run. - We sat up late mapping his campaign Next morning , some of us advised John- , son of our decision and asked his support . He wag popping mad , of course , and that afternoon he announced as a candidate . He was a 2-to-1 underdog , but he campaigned cannily , splitting Stevenson 's conservatives with Stevenson 's endorsement by the A F of L , then splitting , the A F of L. when he finally harried Stevenson into saying Taft-Hartley was good for the country . He squeezed into the Democratic primary by 87 votes , was elected that fall by more than 2 to 1 , and had taken his first step up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary feeling , which surely must be vanity , he would never have been a candidate , and he would not be President now . Other top politicians , even Presidents , have had diversions of family or sport or fun to draw them from their appointed path . Lyndon and his family have had but one devotion and that is to his career This means that The Job is the thing , and he and his family are capable of working eighteen to ' twenty hours a day on it In the ? case of the Johnsons , one part of The Job was securing a nest egg When he first ran for Congress at 27 , in 1937 , businessmen supporters of his many opponents snorted that Johnson was no good because he 'd never met a payroll . In Texas , which has been closely split for decades on conservative-liberal lines , a candidate , to be successful , must get the support  --  and the money  --  to cover the vast distances by air  --  and by electronics . To get the money , he has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . Johnson could n't get the power company support , because he was deeply ' committed to public power and REA co-ops , a commitment dating back in his family , probably , to the generation before he was born . There was no oil or gas in his 10th District . So he and Mrs. Johnson went into the radio business , nudged by a vision perhaps of what was to come in that field . He also went into land  --  coached , no doubt , by Edgar H. Perry , Sr , who made a fortune in land in Austin and who was one , of many successful businessmen who saw Johnson 's potential and took the young Congressman under their wings . As time wore on , the ' growth of land values and of radio-TV income eliminated the ' charge that Johnson had never met a payroll . Now his enemies holler that he 's done too well . Some sort of crisis had developed at Hondo , Tex. , where a pilot 's training school was being operated under contract by H. B. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative , millionaire and big payer of federal taxes . Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson flew back to Austin for the weekend to meet with Zachry and others concerned with the loss of a payroll at Hondo The business at hand being over , Senator Johnson turned to Zachry , who held the construction contract for extension of runways at Bergstrom Air Force Base , at the edge of Austin . He said : " Could n't the government save some money out there at BergStrom if you put on a second shift of men ? You 've got your supervision and your equipment , and you 're just running the equipment eight hours a day . Besides , we need to get those B-52s in operation , " Zachry reckoned the work could be completed at less total cost with a second shift The ' Senator told him to have Studies made over the weekend to show how much could be saved for " us taxpayers . " " Get that into my office in Washington Monday , and we 'll get an order authorizing a second shift " Johnson left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who knew business and who was interested in saving dollars for the taxpayers . He walked down the The NATION street , with a liberal friend and explained the action this way : " We 've got 2,500 men unemployed here in Austin . If we can put them to work next week , there will be 2,500 men and 7,500 women and kids who 'll have a lot finer Christmas . " That has always seemed to me to explain Lyndon B. Johnson , how he thinks and , perhaps more important , how he operates . He can translate any plan or proposal into the language of the person he 's talking to , and make it seem just right in the listener 's language . I look back at a memo I wrote in 1951 to Llewellyn White of The Reporter , who wanted a run-down on Johnson In it I said : " Lyndon intends to he President some day . He may make it , if his health holds out " It did , of course , but only after he had worked himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was one of those heart attacks which save a man 's life because , with The Job in mind , Johnson did what the doctors said , and he 's still doing what they say . While the Johnson family background is ' solidly Democratic , Johnson himself came from the kind of country and poor farm background that bred the Populists . So did Sam Rayburn and so did John Nance Gamey . I recall my father , a Democratic county chairman in the 1890s , when the Populists were running strong and winning offices , ; saying that " We Democrats had to take the Populists ' platform over to beat them and the Republicans . " It has always been my belief that Rayburn and ' his prot  --  g ? Johnson were right out of that same strain . You might call them " agrarian radicals . " They worked for farm programs , rural electricity , public power , controlling Wall Street , public housing , low interest rates and social security . They took these stands simply because they had known poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson all became wealthy ; while serving full time in Washington . They did so because they were smart enough to see what was going to happen , or could keep their ears open to find out what they did n't know . In the American free-enterprise system , men of this caliber can and will become wealthy , even when they work at wealth as moonlighters . I have been in with Lyndon and , October 19 , 1964 out with.Lyndon . I find some mean letters in any file that I have written hini for departing from Democratic platforms of the 1950s . And I find mean replies . Yet I recall many times in arguments over Johnson that I have told my disdainful liberal friends that Johnson is just as liberal as his constituency will let him be . There is no question but that Johnson ihas that characteristic once ascribed to a political leader : " First you find out where the people want to go . Then you get out in front and lead them ? here . " Sometimes , as at that postwar meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading them there as he found out where they wanted to go , Johnson has had little contact with state governments , but the contacts he has had have convinced him that they very often do not " get the job done for the folks , " and that to him is the purpose of government . Texas state government gets a full fourth of its income in federal aid , dispensed largely by officials who cuss ' centralized government . It is not hard to recall how Johnson , sick and tired of trying to sell Texas on working to provide water for its future , slapped in a bill one day to create a federal study commission , which got the money and developed a water master plan for Texas so ambitious that Texans are still stunned as they find out more and more about it . The late Walter Prescott Webb convinced Johnson of the need for water , development in Texas . Johnson asked his Senate colleague , Price Daniel , going home to become governor , to get water planning started . When the legislature turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill and got the study going . I remember his telling me one time , when Secretary of the Navy John Connally and Rep. Jim Wright were both thinking of leaving Washington to run for governor , that both of them already had better jobs than being governor of Texas . He could n't understand why people would want to leave responsible federal jabs to undertake the empty job of being titular head of the Texas state . government . ( That recollection will get you a fast argument , because the campaigners against Connally , who did run and win , are still ' convinced that LBJ sent him home to take over that office as a part of the LBJ empire . ) There 's another attribute you 've got to recognize in Johnson . He 's a seller of ideas . He may not have many of them himself , but he can recognize one Wthen he sees it . His real gift is selling ideas and programs to the people who count . One weekend he came hack from Washington , where he had just managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote together to send an anti-labor bill back to committee . Hubert and Muriel Humphrey were with him , and the Johnsons asked my wife Emma and me out for the weekend . That was the first time I realized he could take a joke on himself . At dinner he was bragging about getting all the Democrats to vote together . " I 'll send you a picture , Stu , of Hubert Humphrey and Senator Byrd hugging , " he , joked . had one of his 1937 campaign placards on her wall . But when we got back to the ranch , it was LBJ , not HHH , the inventor of the soil bank idea , who was selling all of us on what a good idea it was to get worn-out land out of production and into the growing of grass that restores fertility  --  because someday we 'll need all the productive land we can get . The program became law , by the teamwork of Humphrey , who thought of it , and of Johnson , who sold it , in a ' Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been close to Johnson . When he was a boy there were times when it looked as if the Sam John-sons might not have one much longer . When FDR signed the first public-housing bill into law , Johnson was there , and elicited a promise that his district would get the first public-housing project in the nation . Lyndon came-home and took on the vested financial interest of Austin , which owned and rented the slum houses to Negroes , Latin Americans and whites . With the help of Mayor Tom Miller , s the Austin Housing Authority was created . It now operates more than 800 units , but its ' goal always is to shove people out , once their levels of desire have been built up , into homes of their own . We saw that again at Christmas of 1963 , ' when Johnson was summoning Cabinet members and agency heads down to Texas to talk about trimming their budgets . Only one of them left the LBJ ranch with a bigger budget request than he had brought . That was Housing Administrator Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crystal Ballroom for a White House press briefing , bubbling over with housing ideas and plans which he had obviously obtained just that day on the Pedernales . Johnson did n't steal the 1948 Senate election . Much has been written about it , particularly in recent months , but the bald fact remains that Johnson 's opposition wanted the Jim Wells County election results changed , by vote of a new County Democratic Executive Committee , which had been certified to office by the previous County Democratic Executive Committee that had also certified the votes for Johnson , If the chicken was mangy , so was its egg , the new county committee . We had an election on that issue in Texas , in November , 1948 , with the Republicans running a respectable millionaire , Jack Porter . He had the full support of former Gov . Coke Stevenson , who had lost to Johnson by 87 votes . The jury of Texas voters heard the whole story discussed interminably . The verdict : Johnson , 785,335 ; Porter , 381,110 . Among those who knew the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked for station KTBC briefly in 1945 and 1946 . I find a letter that may explain the business success of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson . They paid us a Christmas bonus that year , and I wrote Bird a note about it . Part of her reply went like this : " We feel that when business is good for us , it follows that it ought to be good for all the people ' who work in the shop . " Well , the chief engineer , general manager , four ad salesmen , the program director , the news editor , and half a dozen more who were with KTBC ' in 1945 are still there . A lot of others who quit wish they were still there , because the pay and company retirement plans are such that several of the older staff members are nearing retirement with six-figure annuities Folk who feel the ' business is partly theirs have a way of making a business really gin . They , too , want it said that Lyndon has met a payroll . I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time had done a cover story on him . It had needled him about his gold cuff links , and some of his other vanities which should be understandable to Henry Luce who was a po ' boy , too , for a time . I had worked on the story , checking out some of the many items Time had looked into . I had been agreeably surprised by how well Time had treated Lyndon , and told him so . It was n't two minutes before we were in a helluva argument , which could have included some bilateral name-calling . I stomped out , swearing to myself I 'd never be for that guy again . But , and this is important , there 's a Saving Grace around Lyndon , name of Lady Bird . When I got home , she had called Emma to invite us out to the ranch to visit with Sam Rayburn . All was sweetness and light , and Lady Bird kept us so busy looking at the cattle that we just never did get back to our argument . If Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nepotism laws do n't apply to Cabinet jobs . Looking back , I find I have not yet really touched on Lyndon 's true magic . He can hold his temper when it 's important , because he can keep his eye on the ball . When Johnson was senior Senator and then Vice President , and Ralph Yarborough was junior and then senior Senator from Texas , they clashed daily . But when Johnson became President , he recognized that Yarborough was a guy who had been voting for the Johnson program when it was the Kennedy program , and that he needed to keep Yarborough in the Senate . Back home , Johnson 's friends were busy drumming up a conservative Democrat to beat Yarborough , and expecting LBJ to help them . But he sent the word , loud and clear : Run against Yarborough and you 're running against me . They subsided , ungracefully , and still tried to beat Yarborough quietly , without letting Lyndon know . But during the fall campaign John-. son made what must have been a tough statement for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a Senator who voted for the people more than Senator Yarborough has voted for them . " So there you have even modesty . To Texas liberals , Johnson has generally been the lesser of two evils at election time . Some of us have thought that he was - as liberal as he could be and get elected , by a Texas constituency . ' But since he picked up and passed the Kennedy program in 1964 , you wo n't find a single Texas liberal voting against him on November 3 , just as you did n't find a liberal against him in 1960 , as he got a national constituency for the first time and , for the first time , ran as a liberal . In 1960 , it may have been because he was linked with Kennedy . This time , we 've begun to think that in our hearts we know he 's right .
