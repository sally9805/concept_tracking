Session in Self-Criticism <P> Sir : As a Navy officer who has just completed three years on active duty ( 17 months in Viet Nam ) I read your cover story on the draft June 3 with distaste . Like it or not , we are deeply committed in Viet Nam , and the armed forces need men - especially leadership potential-to fulfill this commitment . If Mr. Wilson and others like him would spend less time endeavoring to support their selfish motives , and more time reflecting on their obligations to the country that provided their education , perhaps the enemy would be less encouraged in their continuing aggression . Perhaps if Mr. Wilson et al . would face up to these obligations , they might discover that the training gained in the service would make them more hireable and give them the intangible reward of having served . <P> A.

If young men their age were n't dying in Asia , these college boys ' children and grandchildren might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commune rather than dreaming up ways to beat the draft . I had a privileged education-Choate ' 53 and Yale ' 57 , but the greatest privilege I 've had was 3 years as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army . I 'll serve again if need be . <P> JAY C. KUHN San Francisco <P> Sir : I read with interest of the futility expressed by today 's draft-age youth . In 1953 , a high school junior , I received my " Greetings . " It obviously did not matter to anyone that I had just entered this country , could hardly speak English , had already spent five years surviving a war , and , above all , after ten years could finally attend a decent school . No , on reading " The President of the U.S. etc . ... " I did not become furious , nor did I rocket my Volkswagen around the block . The affluent society had not yet given me a chance to own a car . <P> ILMARS BIRZNIEKS Instructor <P> University of North Carolina Greensboro , N.C. <P> Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stateless men who would welcome an opportunity to fight for their country . I refer to convicts-men who have lost their freedom by their own misdeeds . You will recall that Field Marshal Rommel put his criminal elements together in a motorcycle battalion and subsequently awarded them several unit citations . Many of us at Kentucky State Penitentiary are youthful offenders ; some , like me , have had military training . We beg for a chance to prove ourselves on the Viet Nam battlefront . <P> JAMES E.

Dee Mak ! <P> <P> Sir : That Thailand is a nation of stability and strength is obvious : states under strict military dictatorship usually are . That this same country is a " land of the free " is highly unbelievable . <P> ( MRS . ) LOUISE VIDAS Champaign , Ill . <P>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
