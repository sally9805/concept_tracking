Covering North Viet Nam 's Ho Chi Minh over the past 25 years has never been an easy journalistic assignment . Even the name is an alias . It translates as " he who enlightens , " yet few Western news men have seen him , much less sat down for an interview . Nevertheless , for this week 's cover story on the death of Ho and the new era that begins in North Viet Nam , our Hanoi watchers around the world were able to piece together a detailed picture of the complex Communist leader and Vietnamese nationalist . <P> Here in New York , the cover story was edited by Ron Kriss and written by Bob McCabe and John Shaw . They were able to draw on the reminiscences of Frank White , a former TIME Correspondent and now a Time Inc. executive . As a major in Hanoi at the end of World War II , White met Ho for a chat and a whisky three or four times a week , and gained many insights into the man 's mystique . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " recalls White . " You got the impression that he had been isolated for a long time . He would ask questions about what San Francisco looked like . What were the buildings like ? How many people had cars , refrigerators ? He did n't seem to be interested in Communism as an international conspiracy . He talked in terms of what the country would do . " <P> The reportage for our fourth Ho cover turned up another bit of intelligence that holds particular interest for us . Whenever Ho was in Kunming during World War II , he visited the U.S. Office of War Information . His request : TIME , the Weekly News magazine . Later from Communist sources , we heard that he was especially pleased by our first cover portrait , by Boris Chaliapin , which depicted him as a lean and hot-eyed fanatic - quite unlike the benevolent fatherly image projected by Hanoi .
