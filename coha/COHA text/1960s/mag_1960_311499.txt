THE BALLAD OF PECKHAM RYE ( 160 pp. ) - Muriel Spark-Lippincott ( $3.75 ) . <P> " Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife ? " the vicar asks Humphrey . <P> " No , " Humphrey replies , " to be quite frank , I wo n't . " <P> It is really the Devil who is speaking so caddishly through Humphrey . The Devil in this incarnation is known as Dougal Douglas , or occasionally as Douglas Dougal , and he comes equipped with a crooked right shoulder , a clawlike right hand , and two small bumps on his head where a plastic surgeon has removed the horns . When he looks at people , he is " like a succubus whose mouth is its eyes . " In the short span of this hilarious novel , Douglas the Devil coaxes into mortal sin not only Humphrey Place but most of the first citizens in the South London district of Peckham Rye . <P> British Novelist Spark has been compared to Evelyn Waugh , but the comparison is inexact : she is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a novelist in whose hands the commonplace becomes mysteriously implausible , the routine eerily irrational . Unlike the scheming septuagenarians of her earlier novel , Memento Mori , the inhabitants of Peckham Rye are so determinedly average that they lack even the capacity to sin grandly . When Mr. Vincent Druce , the managing director of a small textile firm , visits his secretary , Miss Merle Coverdale , to make love to her in the evening , their activity is as carefully calculated as the time-motion studies with which Druce plagues his employees : dinner before the TV ( Brussels sprouts with a bottle of stomach tablets by the plates ) , an hour in bed , in the course of which Merle " twice screamed because Mr. Druce had once pinched and once bit her , " and after which she habitually " went into the scullery and put on the kettle while he put on his trousers and went home to his wife . " <P> When Dougal comes among these people , as director of " human research " in Mr. Druce 's textile firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . Dixie Morse , who is working nights at a cinema in order to save money for a model bungalow , refuses to sleep any longer with Humphrey Place , and he , in turn , leaves her at the altar . Mr. Weedin , the personnel manager , looks into Dougal 's bewitched eyes and at " the alarming bones of his hands " and suffers a nervous breakdown . Mr. Druce himself , suspecting that Dougal is a police informer in alliance with Merle Coverdale , kills his mistress by stabbing her nine times with a corkscrew . Dougal at about that time flees Peckham Rye for Africa , where he makes a living selling portable tape recorders to witch doctors . <P> Neither Dougal 's victims nor the reader ever discovers precisely what is deviling them . It is Novelist Spark 's triumph that it never seems to matter . When Dougal is accused of being " unnatural , " he replies : " All human beings who breathe are a bit unnatural . " On every page of Peckham Rye , the author demonstrates that notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
