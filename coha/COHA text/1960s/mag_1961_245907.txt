He has been called " the last pirate of the Mediterranean , " " a soul of the Middle Ages , " and " the Rockefeller of Spain . " None of these titles quite fits the fantastic career and character of Juan Alberto March y Ordinas , a stooped , eagle-beaked Spaniard who in his ninth decade is perhaps the world 's most mysterious and powerful billionaire . Shrewd and ruthless , the shadowy figure of Juan March has floated across the face of Europe for more than half a century , bringing public officials low , underwriting dictators , helping to finance two world wars ( on both sides ) , and buying himself virtual immunity from the law . With characteristic foresight , March bankrolled Dictator Francisco Franco 's Spanish Civil War campaign . Today , still Franco 's creditor and a powerful voice in Spanish affairs , he boasts a personal fortune that is said to match the U.S. 's entire foreign aid program to Spain - a matter of $1 billion . " I 'm so rich , " Juan March once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . " <P> <P> With a passionate aversion to publicity , March seldom allows his name to appear as the president or director of any of his companies , and , in the censored press of Dictator Franco , he gets away with it . Acting through intermediaries , March owns or controls Spain 's tobacco and gasoline monopolies , a major bank ( Banco Central ) , the principal brewery , chemical companies , mines , shipyards , steel plants , power and oil companies , and even a Coca-Cola bottling plant . He has a stake in the Institute Nacional de Industria , the state-owned agency for industrial development that controls and invests in private industry with state capital . Outside Spain , he controls weblike holding companies in London and New York , has a 25% interest in the Swiss international banking firm , Societe de Banque Suisse . " I have no need of banks , " March has bragged . " The bankers need me . " <P> Cut-Rate Counterfeiting . Last week Juan March was deep in refighting an old battle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial parleys in Paris , March and the March-manipulated Catalonian power combine-which supplies electricity to Spain 's most industrialized region-were negotiating at long last to settle their 13-year battle with Belgium 's giant Sofina power syndicate. * <P> The fight , which began in 1948 , is a classic example of the way March has built his financial empire . The holding company of the Catalonian utilities had been The Barcelona Traction , Light &; Power Co. , Ltd. , a Canadian corporation that was in turn controlled by Sofina . Eager to take over the utilities , March persuaded Franco to ban the export of their profits to Barcelona Traction 's Canadian headquarters . Cut off from its sources of revenue , Barcelona Traction could not pay the interest on its outstanding bonds , most of which were held outside Spain . They tumbled in value , were quickly snapped up by March at cut-rate prices .
