Americans , looking back on the tumultuous events of 1968 , may be more inclined to ask God 's mercy and guidance than to offer Him thanks for His blessings . <P> <P> LYNDON JOHNSON 'S fifth and final Thanksgiving Proclamation was not the conventional catalogue of national self-congratulation . How could it be , after the sort of year the nation-and the world-has experienced ? Flat and matter-of-fact , it fell far short of eloquence . Yet in tone and temper , it probably came close to expressing the mood of Americans in a year many of them would rather forget . <P> For the U.S. there are , as always , plentiful reasons enough for thanksgiving . The nation has rarely been more prosperous ; peace is a more realistic hope ; the country is increasingly aware of the problems it must solve . The election proved , as the President noted in his proclamation , " the endurance and stability of our democracy , as we prepare once more for an orderly transition of authority .

In city after city in the U.S. , strikes or slowdowns have closed schools , stopped garbage collection , endangered the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hospitable friend . Looking at the sunset from a Los Angeles freeway-refracted through smog and windshield-Los Angeles Times Columnist Jack Smith wondered what a man from an earlier century might have felt if he had sat beside him in the automobile : " A rational man , like Dr. Johnson , must surely see that the species had at last given up its glimmer of sanity and was annihilating itself in this magnificent , psychotic Gtterdammerung . " <P> Abroad , the prospect of improved relations with the Soviet Union , a goal that seemed within reach in the mid ' 60s , has been set back by the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia . As a new Administration prepares to take power , Americans are questioning for the first time in a generation their basic role in the world community . Though the signs of plenty abound throughout the Western world , the chronic international money crisis threatens to produce political as well as fiscal instability for millions ( see THE WORLD ) .                 @ @ @ @
