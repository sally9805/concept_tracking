ONE OF THE FOUNDERS by P. H. Newby . 285 pp . Lippincott. $4.95 . <P> <P> One evening after a hard day at the office , a chap named Hedges is met at the front door by Mrs. Hedges , who hands him a stiff shot of sherry and a nasty bit of news : he is now , and for several months has been , a cuckold . A bit of rough weather , that . But as a British civil servant , Hedges takes a firm grip on his brolly and does the decent thing . Even after his wife divorces him and marries the other bloke , he still sends her birthday cards and occasionally advances the new couple a few quid to keep things going . People call him a chump , and Hedges is vaguely aware that they are right , but what can a man do when he lacks the " ability to loathe ? " <P> Bloody well develop it . And so he does in the course of this minor , deft , deliciously droll and sometimes startlingly profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Revolution and Roses ) , the most ingenious and beguiling Puck to appear on the scene since Henry Green came popping out of the all-too-hollow log of contemporary English literature . <P> Learning to loathe is n't easy for a man who would much rather learn to love , and for a long time Hedges evades the issue . He sneaks off to spend the night with a " sordid woman " - he is shocked to discover that she does n't have twin beds . He makes a pass at a cute trick who works for him-he is startled to get stabbed through the instep by her stiletto heel . <P> And then one day , after a symbolic and gloriously silly baptism in an oily-slimy estuary , he strides sopping and transfigured into what may or may not be a religious vision : " He saw the ball of shining fog float ever so slowly along until it caught up with him . Now he walked in the ball of fire , in the feeling that at last he could stop fighting . He surrendered . He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cloud breathing out light . " Somehow , after that , Hedges can both love and loathe . He loathes his ex-wife and publicly informs her of the fact . He loves the girl with the stiletto heel and promptly takes her to wife . Happy ending ? In his concluding sentence , Author Newby murmurs drily : " They lived more or less happily for quite a long time after . "
