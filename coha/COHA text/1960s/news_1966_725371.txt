txt Letters , g.232 Letters SHOULD WE DEAL WITH THE VIETCONG ? TO THE EDITOR I am frankly distressed by the conclusions reached by Hanson Baldwin , in his appraisal of United States military policy alternatives in Vietnam ( " The Case for Escalation , " Feb. 27 ) . He outlines three possibilities , pretending that they are the only courses of action open to the United States . Specifically , if evacuation , " and the political . psychological and military catastrophe that would result from such a surrender . " is rejected , then there is no choice except either to maintain strength and activity at its present level or to escalate . Mr. Baldwin thereby implies that no alternatives exist between pursuing at least the present level of operations or surrender . After stating his case for escalation , Mr. Baldwin presents " the more serious arguments against escalation and attempts to answer them . " Neither in this section or in the earlier outline of policy alternatives does he even allude to the possibility of negotiating directly with the forces the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , he considers negotiations , which President Johnson has made " sincere ? even frenetic ? attempts to achieve , " to be a lost cause , since Hanoi is unwilling to talk with the United States . Thus totally ignored are any suggestions , such as those made the previous week by Robert Kennedy and not discounted by General Taylor , that entail treating the Vietcong as an authentic ? albeit illegal ? political force , to be dealt with politically rather than Just militarily . STEPHEN SOMME .. Haverford , Pa . ? To THE EDITOR : When Mr. Baldwin argues that war does settle things , " the scales of history from the days of vanquished Carthage to the Wagnerian end of Hitler in the ruins of Berlin show it does , " I find myself thinking of the neat settlement which followed the decisive victory of the Vietnamese people against the French at Dienbienphu . Ever since , the Vietnamese have been fighting , bleeding and running short of rice , while the poor , weak French , who let their military down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERRICK . Jamaica , N. Y. ? To THE EDITOR : Mr. Baldwin apparently does // // not read the paper of which he is an editor , because if he did he would know that : ( 1 ) The Saigon Government , controlling less than half of Vietnam , is a military junta that all parties concede would fall in a free election . ( 2 ) We are intervening in a civil war . Nowhere does Mr. Baldwin mention the estimates of North Vietnamese troops fighting in the South , a figure conceded by our own military to be a small percentage of the Vietcong , convincing proof that the Vietcong would and could fight as an indigenous Southern liberation effort without Northern aid . ( 3 ) The " domino " theory is discredited even by the most ardent " hawks . " A major power can only be denied its sphere of influence by war , something Khrushchev understood when he bowed to U.S. pressure in Cuba . Red China is here to stay whether we like it or not . Let the Vietnamese work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die for such un-American political ends ; the astronomical costs can better be used to alleviate human suffering here and abroad . KENNETH J. RAWSON . ? Roslyn Heights , N. Y. ? TO THE EDITOR : Mr. Baldwin states that Asian wars tend to be wars of unusual ferocity , and by contrast American methods of warfare are gentlemanly , humane , to be emulated by all combatants . The difference between Asian and American methods of war is simply one of technology . Lacking modern weaponry , the Asian needs to do his killing personally , man to man . Civilized Americans do their killing from 35,000 feet or on the ground with impersonal , machinelike efficiency . This is great for our conscience , but the fact that our methods are cleaner does not make them any less beastly . I submit that , with the possible exception of the crusaders , no other people have committed so many crimes against humanity with so much hypocritical self-righteousness as we Americans . MARTIN JEZER . New York . ? To THE EDITOR : I would like to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for printing the first sensible material your paper has carried on the subject for months . DAVID SIBULKIN . New York . IS IT WORTH IT ? To THE EDITOR : Granting the existence of " sophisticated " delivery systems for nuclear weapons and highly ? efficient antiaircraft and antimissile systems in the arsenals of both the United States and its potential adversaries , it seems highly questionable that the United States should continue to run the multiple risks involved in keeping nuclear-armed bombers constantly in the air . Can we honestly assert that the alleged " advantages " of such mobile bases outweigh the potentially catastrophic liabilities ? ( See " Palomares Learns to Love the Bomb , " Feb. 20 , by Tad Szule . ) RONALD L. HAMMERLE . Lawrenceville , N. J. HOW TO OPERATE TARES FOR POOR ? To THE EDITOR : Prof. Michael D. Reagan 's suggestion that " Washington Should Pay Taxes to the Poor " ( Feb. 20 ) ignores the fact that the amount of income that an individual is required by law to report on his tax form often bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for public assistance . Professor Reagan implies that we Could adopt NIT ? a negative income tax ? " simply " by reprogramming the computers of the Internal Revenue Service to make out more checks than the present number of refunds requires . However , only by radically revising our present fiscal policies to require individuals to report their total assets as well as their incomes could the computers distinguish the affluent from the needy . The magnitude of the problems involved in such a revision should be obvious to even the most casual observer . MICHAEL H. GRANOF . New York . ? To THE EDITOR : I should like to note , that at least one of the major attractions of NIT is totally illusory . This is the unfounded belief that the program could be administered almost automatically under the Federal income tax system , eliminatingthe need for personal checking and caseworkers as in present programs . The proposals envision that people will establish eligibility for receipts from NIT merely by filing a tax return indicating income of less than a certain level . Payments would then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Query : What control will prevent anyone from filing one or more returns for himself or any other person and automatically collecting additional NIT payments ? When one considers payment of income tax there is obviously little incentive to file multiple tax returns . There are few controls now to prevent such a practice , and fraudulent claims for refunds perpetrated in this . manner have been a recurring // ( Continued from Puyc 19 ) problem in the tax system . When the claim is for an NIT payment , even the dubious control of W-2 forms or other evidence of prepayment will be absent . The only " automatic " control which exists to prevent such abuse is the Social Security system and multiple numbers there already constitute an administrative problem . LEE J. SEIDLER . New York . The author replies : " Messrs . Granof and Seidler are correct that the NIT plan would not entirely dispense with the need for administrative controls , but I insist that problems such as those they bring up could be worked out with minimal auditing and especially without the degrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security or income tax number can be made into a universal , nonduplicating system of identification , and the computerization of procedures will simplify whatever cross-checking is found to be necessary . Probably a revised income reporting form will be needed , and probably a minute percentage of cheaters and cases of inequity will be found . But these could hardly be more than occurs now , with most of the special privileges going to others than the poor . " When the appropriate administrative officials and Congressional committees get down to writing a specific NIT bill . I am confident that ingenuity will be applied to the technical drafting problems .. At this point in time the discussion needs to focus on the concept in broad outline : is it a good one or not ? If it is , we will find a way to work out the details .
