Gongs clanged and drums rumbled . Chief of State Liu Shao-chi and Premier Chou En-lai were on hand at the airport . On the trip into the city , a roaring crowd of half a million ( said the Red radio ) tossed flower petals . Lampposts were festooned with bunting , and at Peking 's Gate of Heavenly Peace colored balloons floated skyward trailing slogans of greetings . It was just about the biggest and gaudiest welcome Peking had organized for any visitor ever-including the 1959 one for Nikita Khrushchev . <P> <P> The object of this lavish enthusiasm was Skou Tour , 38 , the neutralist President of an obscure little West African nation that has been independent for scarcely two years . But in the scramble for influence in the emergent new nations of Africa , the Red Chinese were determined not to be outdone by the Russians . In Moscow , Nikita Khrushchev had given Tour a new trade agreement and a massive palace for his embassy . But in Peking , every crowd was a little bigger , every rally a little noisier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first solid foothold on the vast African continent . But the stakes are far greater than Guinea ; China was bidding for influence in all of Africa 's disintegrating colonial empires . If Tour went away properly impressed , he could be counted on to pass the word to the leaders of Africa 's other new and needy nations . Cried Peking 's Mayor Peng Chen : " U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the national independence movement in Africa . Imperialism remains imperialism , just as the jackal remains a jackal . " Replied Tour : " Our friend , the mayor of Peking , is absolutely right in describing imperialism as a wolf which changes its clothing as it wishes . . . but it can never change its nature , that is its actions toward sheep , above all when they are not united . " <P> Tour was happy to accept Peking 's offer of a $25 million , no-interest loan . But , already adept at the begging bowl , he was careful not to join in the open attacks on the U.S. or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialism . To do so would destroy the chance of wangling a bit of Western aid to supplement and offset the swag he had picked up from the eager Communists .
