Sir : It is becoming increasingly difficult for me to comprehend the mountain of abuse heaped on those who oppose the war in Viet Nam . I wonder what it is we are fighting for here if it is not to preserve the right to dissent . It is far more important for the people of the U.S. to be sure that , as a result of this war , we are providing for the Vietnamese the full benefits of democracy , than it is to be sending cookies and writing letters to the accompaniment of highly chauvinistic demands for unanimity of opinion . We have not declared war on North Viet Nam , and until we do , anyone in the U.S. is within his rights to express any opinion he wishes without fear of retribution , and without fear of being branded a traitor . Most people here in Viet Nam know what they are fighting for , and no amount of controversy in the U.S. will have much effect on them . <P> PETER G. BOURNE Captain , Medical Corps , U.S.A. Viet Nam <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country infuriate me . I do n't deny the right of dissent to the Vietniks , the pacifists , or any responsible person . But the dissenters ' reasoning as expressed by young " men " like Mr. O'Brien can border on the absurd . He cites his " sacrifices " to gain an education . Many young people , and even old people , have made the same sacrifices . Most , thank God , gain maturity and a sense of responsibility along the way . But for the grace of all the men who have served in peace and in war since 1776 , young Mr. O'Brien might not have had the opportunity to make his sacrifices . The Viet Cong can not emasculate Mr. O'Brien ; he has done it himself . If his selfish kind should prevail , we would all eventually lose everything . ( MRS . ) MARGUERITE P. GALE Lansdowne , Pa . <P> Sir : I am disturbed at the series of letters by cry babies who feel that a few years devoted to the defense of this great country is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can testify that I too attended college while working 48 hours a week-after I got my Purple Heart . There are thousands like me who made financial sacrifices to serve , and if this country needs a 36-year-old overweight paratrooper tomorrow , I shall be more than happy to defend Mr. O'Brien 's pet store , regardless of where it is located . <P> ROBERT FOUTTS Compton , Calif . <P> Drop That Cool <P> Sir : I am one of today 's " alienated " youth . Your Essay " On Not Losing One 's Cool About the Young " Dec. 24 deeply disturbs me , for I feel that it does no more than add to the already heavy strain of mass misinterpretation regarding my peer group . We are not the impulsive , irrational , rebellious youth you describe . We are the hope of a society racked by changing moral standards , breakdowns of age-old prejudices , and adults who can not or will not bend to accommodate to new situations . Naturally we are going to make mistakes , for the answers are not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My advice to the adult world is : Drop your cool and read the signs clearly . We are n't searching for kicks . We 're looking for answers to the problems bequeathed to us by you . <P> MARILYN CHADWICK College Park , Md.
