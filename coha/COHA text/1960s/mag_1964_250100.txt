Like a venerable bank or a vintage Bordeaux , a great university must be ever watchful of its reputation , and the University of Notre Dame is more watchful than most . Once the school 's fame lay in its fightin ' - Irish football cult ; then the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh became president , and the school got academic quality too . This year a great new coach , Ara Parseghian , offered hope of a fine Olympic balance . <P> Now , says Hesburgh , the hard-won image is endangered by a $4,000,000 Hollywood farce called John Goldfarb , Please Come Home , in which Shirley MacLaine and a platoon of harem houris corrupt the Notre Dame football team . Last week in Manhattan , Notre Dame charged foul play , filed an in junction in New York State Supreme Court to block 20th Century-Fox from showing the movie . <P> Claiming misappropriation and exploitation of its name and insignia , the suit protested that Notre Dame would suffer " irreparable and immeasurable injury " if Goldfarb were shown , but the school did not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for sale for such uses , " said the petition . What particularly annoyed Hesburgh was the way-out plot that depicts Notre Dame players " as undisciplined gluttons and drunks .

Shirley MacLaine just happens to be at hand as a reporter getting a picture-magazine scoop inside the seraglio . The vengeful Fawz fields a football team of his own and blackmails Goldfarb into coaching it . An eager U.S. State Department sends the Irish to the Middle East , where they are wined , dined , wiggled at , and ultimately defeated ( 34-29 ) by the burnoosed bandits of Fawz U. <P> Fox officials rushed to the defense , calling the film " a zany fantasy , a free-swinging satire . " Doubleday &; Co. , one of two publishers also named in the suit , added informatively that the original book , heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everyone waited to see who would have the last laugh , but preview audiences in Hollywood and Manhattan were already spreading the word that John Goldfarb had handily outFoxed itself long before the roar from South Bend . It is not simply a bad movie ; it is a truly breathtaking display of tastelessness , ineptitude and wretched humor , crudely written and performed as one long leer . Only with a break like getting sued did Goldfarb appear to stand much chance at the box office .
