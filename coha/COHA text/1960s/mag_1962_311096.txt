For a businessman in Trenton who wants to call the Western Electric Co. in Manhattan-but does n't know the number-it is about as easy as falling off a logarithm : first he dials 2125551212 ( Information in Manhattan ) , then 2125712345 for Western Electric . If he is lucky he wo n't have to give an extension number for the man he wants to talk to ; if he is luckier , he can still remember why he was calling in the first place . <P> This numerologicl nightmare is only a foretaste of what the future holds for dialers when the Bell Telephone System 's ANC ( All-Number-Calling ) plan goes into effect all over the U.S. Already 11 million of the 76 million telephones in the U.S. are on ANC . The Bell System and 3,000 independent companies expect to convert all telephones in five years a projected 95 million . <P> Lost Lust . In the Orwellian world of ANC there will be no telephone exchanges to take pride of comfort in . Philadelphia 's old-guard PEnnypacker and stalwart FIdelity will be gone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Mobile 's TUlip will wither alongside Cincinnati 's BRamble and Santa Fe 's YUcca . Fenton , MO. , will be torn from it 's cozy FIreside , while Chester , Pa. , and its saucy GYpsy will be parted . NIghtingale and HYacinth will nevermore breathe their poetry over Brooklyn 's wires . The sands are running out fpr such venerable status symbols as Upper East Side Manhattan 's BUtterfield 8 and REgent 4 . They will some day be as obsolete as morning coats on Easter Sunday . <P> Official AMerican Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , proprietors of the Bell System , admits a twinge of REgret over the passing of the time-honored names , many of which are holdovers from the days of " Hello , Central , give me Main 444 . " But the telephone company maintains that there is no other choice in the face of rapidly expanding dialing facilities and the increase in the number of telephone sets across the nation . <P> Letters &; Holes . There are only eight holes with three letters each on the dial ( Q and Z @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-letter combinations ( letters that begin a recognizable name or word ) for exchange-namers to work with . <P> But four of the combinations involving letters J , K , L , P , R , S , W , X , Y are deemed useless on the ground that no one could countenance a telephone number beginning with something like YPres , YLang , WRath or KRemlin . That leaves only 60 . Even with an additional number tacked onto the two-letter code , creating exchanges like PRospect 1 up through PRospect 9 , there are still only 540 combinations available . This was more than enough until Direct Distance Dialing came on the scene in 1951 . The U.S. is now divided into 105 code areas , each having its own three-digit number ; within any single DDD area , no two telephone numbers can be the same-and simple mathematics shows that 540 central offices are not enough for some of the more populous dialing areas . <P> All-Number Calling was the answer to the dilemma . Numbers appear at ten holes on a dial , and ANC gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central-office codes* an increase of nearly 50%.
