txt BY EUGENE GRIFFIN OTTAWA , Feb. 4 - Liberals and the Social Credit party threatened the defeat of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker 's minority government with motions of no confidence tonight in the house of commons , after the resignation early today of Defense Minister Douglas Harkness on the nuclear weapons issue . The vote on each of the two motions , either of which could oust the Conservative government from office , will come tomorrow night after another day of debate . Backed in Past Diefenbaker is in danger if the three opposition parties vote in coalition ? against him , but this is not a certainty . In the past , Diefenbaker 's 115 Conservatives , in the house of 265 seats , have been kept in power by the 30 Social Credit votes . The Social Credit decision to move want of confidence against Diefenbaker , on the ground that his government has made no clear statement of policy on defense , was taken during the lunch period in the absence of Real Caouette of Quebec , who is believed to control the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was presented in the house by Robert Thompson of Alberta , the national leader of Social Credit , but one of only four English-speaking members of the bloc . Opposes Nuclear Arms Caouette , who was out of town is against nuclear arms for Canada and is unlikely to try to defeat Diefenbaker . Before the vote , Diefenbaker or one of his ministers will speak in the debate with a chance of persuading Social Credit to withdraw its motion . Also in the house are 19 New Democrats who are opposed to nuclear weapons and , therefore , may save the government against the combined vote of Social Credit and Lilerals . David Lewis of Toronto , one of the New Democratic chieftains , speaking in the house tonight , told Lester Pearson , the Liberal leader , " I hope you 'll never get into power . " Makes Public Disavowal The Liberal want-of-confidence motion made by Pearson came merely as a traditional debate maneuver at this stage of the parliamentary proceedings  --  a government motion to go into committee to consider financial estimates for several government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public disavowal of Diefenbaker 's donothing policy on accepting nuclear warheads despite United States proddings . An open rebuttal of Diefenbaker 's defense policy by the United States state department , in the form of a press release issued in Washington and Ottawa last Wednesday night , has made it impossible for Diefenbaker to take nuclear arms now , even if he wanted to , without appearing to be taking orders from Washington . When the house of commons met this afternoon , Harkness rose from a new seat he took among the back benches behind Diefenbaker and gave the reasons for his resignation . " I believe it is the duty of a minister of national defense to insure the security of Canada to the greatest extent that he believes to be possible , " Harkness said . " I have always believed that we should have nuclear weapons . " Ca n't Reconcile Views Harkness said it has become apparent to him since he made a defense statement in parliament last Monday that his views and Diefenbaker 's on nuclear arms are irreconcilable . He said he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister to postpone the acceptance of nuclear arms until the North Atlantic treaty council meets in Ottawa in May . " I did so agree in the hope of getting the nuclear arms question definitely settled , " he said . " I differ from the prime minister in this way : That I believe we should have obtained nuclear warheads for our weapons carriers as soon as the latter were ready . I thought thruout that by remaining in the cabinet I could better achieve this purpose than by taking the easier course of resigning . " Backs Nuclear Arms " For over two years , " Harkness said in his letter to Diefen- I baker , " you have been aware that I believed that nuclear warheads should be supplied to the four weapons systems we have acquired which are adapted to their use . Bomarc missiles and Voodoo jet interceptor planes in Canada , and Honest John artillery and strike-reconnaissance jet planes with Canadian forces in Europe . " Thruout this period I believed that they would be authorized at the appropriate time . Offered to Quit Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made absolutely clear what I considered the minimum position I could accept , and several times have offered to resign unless it was agreed to . " It has become quite obvious during the last few days that your views and mine as to the course we should pursue for the acquisition of nuclear arms for our armed forces are not capable of reconciliation . Thus it is with a great deal of regret that I now find I must tender my resignation as minister of national defense . Remains in Commons " Until the last few weeks I enjoyed my 51/2 years as a member of your government and trust I have made some contribution to it and to Canada . " Harkness , 59 , a high school teacher from Calgary , Alta. , before he was elected to parliament in 1945 , will continue to sit in the house as a member of Diefenbaker 's Conservative party , until dissolution . Whether he would campaign in Diefenbaker's. behalf in an election is doubtful . Canada 's Prime Minister John Diefenbaker had this smile yesterday as he emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Defense Minister Douglas Harkness " hard to understand . " Some others supported Harkness . ( Story on page 1 )
