txt // way through the autonomic system to the central nervous system . The sympathetic system is arranged in birds much as it is in other vertebrates . Long paired sympathetic chains lie below the vertebrae on each side of the middle line ( Fig. 208 ) . In the cervical , thoracic and lumbar regions they connect segmental sympathetic ganglia , which are connected to the cord in their segments by ( preganglionic ) nerves . In the head the chain joins a large superior cervical ganglion and through it has connection with the brain and the cranial nerves . Nerve fibres pass up and down the chain between the segmental ganglia . A second sympathetic nerve passes down the neck from the superior cervical ganglion and joins the chain near the back end of the neck . Postganglionic nerves pass from the segmental ganglia to the organs in the body cavity and elsewhere . In the birds and mammals but not in lower vertebrates , the post-ganglionic nerves to the body cavity often pass through plexuses and ganglia among the organs . In these ganglia the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cranial nerves ( Cranial outflow ) and in the sacral region ( lumbar outflow ) . Its fibres in the head region lie in cranial nerves III , VII , IX , and X. Those in vagus nerve ( X ) lie in a branch which passes to the body cavity and supplies the organs in the cavity including the gut as far back as the front part of the intestine . The lumbar outflow supplies the cloaca , the hinder part of the intestine and the genital organs . In the parasympathetic system there are no ganglia on the nerves between the organs and the cord , except a thoracic ganglion on the vagus . The nerve fibres pass through plexuses or ganglia on the walls of the organs and the axons from these pass up the length of the parasympathetic nerves to the cord . The function of the autonomic system is to provide , for the visceral and many other organs , co-ordination that is normally independent of the higher centres of the brain , though much of the co-ordination it provides may be modified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a system that has a long history in the vertebrates , but it becomes more elaborated in the higher vertebrates . Both birds and mammals show these elaborations , many of them in parallel . 4 . SENSE ORGANS ( a ) The Eye ( 138,18 ' ) The behaviour of birds clearly shows that in them vision is the dominant sense , and this is borne out by the size and structure of their eyes . Their hearing is also well developed . // The large size of the eye in birds is striking . The orbit occupies a larger part of the skull than in other vertebrates and the eyeball may weigh as much as the brain ; the ostrich eye ( 2 inches in diameter ) is said to be the largest in living land vertebrates . The eyeball fills the orbit closely , in some birds ( owls ) so closely that it can not be moved in the orbit by its muscles . In other birds some movement is possible ? so that , for instance , laterally placed eyes may be turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 353 ) ? but the amount of movement that is possible is always less than in other land animals . // In its general structure the bird 's eye ( Fig. 209 ) is built on the same plan as that of the lizard ( p. 298 ) ; as we have noted ( p. 297 ) , the crocodile , undoubtedly the closest relative of the birds among the reptiles , has an eye that is greatly modified in adaptation to its habits and for this reason is very different from the bird 's eye . Both birds ' and lizards ' eyes differ in many respects from mammalian eyes . Some of the characters in which the bird 's and the lizard 's eyes agree are the following : ( 1 ) Scleral ossicles are present in both and they seem to serve the same function , preventing ( or at least reducing ) deformation of the cornea as the eye accommodates . Their shape results in the eye of the bird being even farther from spherical than the lizard 's eye . ( 2 ) The lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about by deformation of the shape of the lens by pressure upon it of the ciliary processes which are moved in the same way as in the lizard 's eye . It is possible that some deformation of the shape of the cornea may play a part in accommodation . ( 3 ) A pecten is present in the bird 's eye . It is larger and more elaborate than the conus papillaris in the lizard 's eye but seems to be homologous with it . It lies within the cavity of the eyeball in the vitreous humour and its base is always near the blind spot where the optic nerve leaves the eyeball . As is general in vertebrate eyes , the bird 's eye has an area ? the area centralis ( Fig. 210 ) ? in the retina near the central axis of the eye , and at the centre of this area is a fovea . In these areas , and // especially in the fovea , vision is sharpest . But in birds the area centralis is sometimes not , as in other vertebrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open plains , the area centralis is drawn out as a linear horizontal strip across the retina and the fovea may be drawn out as a strip within it ( Fig. 210 ) . This seems to be an adaptation to give a wide distribution of clear vision on the same horizontal level as the bird . In birds , in which the eyes are placed laterally there may be a second ( temporal ) area with structure of the same kind as that of the area centralis . This is placed on the posterior part of the retina . On it the field directly in front of the bird ( Fig. 211 ) can be focused without any turning of the eye . The acuity of the bird 's eye is as great as that of any vertebrate and greater than most . Several of its features make for great acuity . First , the large size of the eye means that only a small part of the field is focused on the retinal cells in a given area of the retina , and that detail is therefore more accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed ? there may be up to 106 rods and cones in a square millimetre of the fovea . Thirdly , and perhaps most importantly , the rods and cones are closely packed in a large area outside as well as in the area centralis , though not so closely as in the fovea ; in mammals there are few rods in areas outside the fovea . Also , each visual cell over this whole area both within and outside the fovea is connected with the brain by a separate nerve fibre ; in the mammals each cell has a separate nerve fibre only in the fovea ; outside it each nerve fibre is con-N // nected to many cells . It results from these characters of the retinal structure that the bird has accurate vision over a large part of the field and not only , as in the mammal , in the small part that is focused on the fovea . In appreciation of detail the typical bird 's eye is probably as good as any mammal 's eye , but its accurate vision over large parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the field . This is probably of great value in the behaviour of the bird . The functions of the pecten have been much discussed . It is clear that its primary function is to provide a supply for the nutrition of the retina subsidiary to the supply from the choroid ( p. 298 ) . It is very vascular and the retina is poorly supplied with blood vessels in the choroid . Food material diffuses from the pecten to the retina through the vitreous humour in the cavity of the eyeball . It has been noted ( p. 298 ) that the conus papillaris seems to have this function in the reptiles . Whether the pecten has any secondary function is doubtful . None of the various theories that have been proposed for a secondary function have been supported by sufficient evidence to be accepted as proved . The base of the pecten is always on the retina far from the area centralis where it would interfere with vision at the fovea , but even so it would seem that its shadow on the retina might interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very doubtful whether it does so . Indeed , the most probable theory of a secondary function is that the shadow may help in picking up objects especially against homogeneous backgrounds such as the sky . The pecten is most often either a conical projection with flanges on its sides or a feather-like process , and it is suggested that objects are more easily picked up as they pass into and out of the shadows of these parts of the pecten as the eye moves . It is claimed that in human vision small objects are more easily picked up against a homogeneous background if viewed through a similar grid . In birds the close fit of the eye into the orbit prevents any possibility of it being withdrawn into the head , as reptilian and amphibian eyes can be ( p. 217 ) , and the retractor bulbi muscle ( p. 246 and Fig. 143 ) which withdraws the eye in reptiles and amphibians has been lost . But the nictitating membrane is retained . Its tendon passes to the back of the eyeball and through a large bursalis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ends in another muscle , the pyramidalis , which is also present in turtles and crocodiles but not in other living reptiles . Contraction of these two muscles retracts the tendon and draws the nictitating membrane over the eye . The nictitating membrane in birds is very transparent and it is // said that it is held over the cornea in many birds during flight , preventing damage of the cornea by its being dried by the current of air passing over it . ( b ) The Ear ( 139 ) The bird 's ear differs from the reptile 's ( p. 299 ) chiefly in the greater elaboration of the sense organs for the appreciation of sound , which have become capable of distinguishing sound of different pitch , giving a sense of tonic hearing . The elaboration of these organs is in many ways similar to that which occurred for the same purpose in the mammalian ear ( p. 448 ) ; among vertebrates birds and mammals alone have a sense of tonic hearing . Since these two groups have evolved independently from an early reptilian stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must conclude that the similarities between their ears have been evolved by parallel evolution . In the birds ' ear the lagena is much longer than in the reptile 's ( Fig. 212 ) . It is more or less straight and it contains a central cavity , here known as the scala media , which is continuous with the cavity of the sacculus and therefore is filled with the endolymph of the inner ear ( p. 248 ) . On the two sides of the scala media lie channels which are branches of the lymphatic spaces around the inner ear and are filled with perilymph . Of these one , the scala vestibuli , passes by the inside of the fenestra oxalis in which the footplate of the stapes lies . ( In birds the footplate is held in position by an annular ligament between it and the wall of the fenestra . ) The other channel , the scala tympani , is in contact with the second window between the middle and inner ears , the fenestra rotunda . This is closed by membrane . The whole organ is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position between the scalae vestibuli and tympani by cartilaginous flanges from the outer wall ( Fig. 213 ) . These flanges also separate the two scalae . Joining the flanges and completing the separation of the scala media from the scala tympani is the basilar membrane , a thin and resonant membrane which contains fibres transverse to the length of the membrane . These increase in length towards the apex of the organ . Between the scala media and the scala vestibuli is another membrane , the tegmental membrane , which is much thicker than the basilar membrane and contains blood vessels . At the apex of the organ the scala media ends blindly and there is at this point a group of sense cells which represent the lagenar macula of the lower vertebrates ( p. 248 ) . Their function is doubtful ; they are certainly not an important part of the sound analysing apparatus , but they may possibly react to sounds , perhaps especially those of low pitch . The apical end of the scala media is surrounded by cartilage , and this is connected by processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no connection at the apex between the scaly vestibuli and the scala tympani , as there is in the mammalian ear . On the side of the basilar membrane toward the scala media lie the auditory sense cells , derived , as in reptiles ( p. 299 ) , not from the lagenar maculae but from other sense cells of the sacculus . As in the mammalian organ of Corti ( p. 450 ) , they are covered by a tectorial membrane which is in contact with their sense hairs . // This membrane passes obliquely across the scala media and joins one of the supporting flanges near the point where the tegmental membrane also joins it . Pressure waves corresponding to the sound vibrations are passed into the organ at the fenestra ovalis by movements of the stapes ( which picks them up from the vibrations of the tympanum at the external boundary of the middle ear ) , and travel through the perilymph of the scala vestibuli . Since there is no apical connection between the scala vestibuli and scala tympani the vibrations can not pass directly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mammalian ear . They reach the scala media through the tegmental membrane , and stimulate the sense cells by vibrations of the basilar membrane and contact of the hairs on the tectorial membrane . Since the transverse fibres in the basilar membrane differ in length as one passes from base to apex of the organ , and will have different periods of vibration , we must assume that different parts of the membrane will respond to sounds of different pitch , and that the analysis of the pitch is so carried out . We do not know whether the process is in details the same as in the mammalian ear ( p. 450 ) . It is believed that discrimination of pitch and sensitivity to weak sounds are about as good in the bird 's ear as in man 's . The speed of reaction is probably better , perhaps ten times better , so that sounds separated by shorter intervals of time can be distinguished . Thus , in its general arrangement this organ resembles the cochlea of the mammal ( p. 448 ) very closely , though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the organ and tic absence of coiling , the smaller number of transverse fibres in the basilar membrane , and the absence of any apical connection between the scala vestibuli and scala tympani , there are differences that may be important for its functioning . Since these organs have been independently evolved to their present structure in birds and mammals , this is one of the most striking examples of parallel evolution in the two groups . ( c ) Nasal Organs ( 135,161 ) In birds the external nares lie laterally or dorsally on the bill , and the nasal cavity passes back to the internal nares which are on the level of the eyes . The passage is divided into three parts widely open to each other ( Fig. 214 ) , and in each part is a turbinal process of the wall ( concha ) . Of these the middle is the largest and is usually wound into a spiral scroll . Only the most posterior concha , also called the olfactory tubercle ? which is in general the smallest of the three ? has olfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is larger and branched , in accord with the greater importance of the // olfactory sense in that bird ( p. 346 ) . The functions of the anterior conchae seem to be to raise the temperature and humidity of the incoming air and to wash solid particles from it . In doing this they are helped by the secretions of the lacrimal and harderian glands . These glands lie around the eye and are variable in size . Their ducts open within the lower lids , and their secretions , besides keeping the cornea moist , are carried to the nasal passage by the lacrimal duct which opens on the middle concha . There they flow on to the surfaces of the conchae . In marine birds the harderian glands are enlarged and have taken on the new function of excreting salt ( 161 ) . 5 . EXCRETION ( 18,172 ) The tubules of ' the bird 's kidney are similar to those of the reptile and amphibian kidneys except that there is present a ( new ) short segment between the proximal and distal convoluted tubules called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is present also in the mammalian kidney ( p. 453 ) , but is there much longer . It seems to have the same function in both birds and mammals , of producing hypertonic urine by re-absorption of water . This is another feature in which the structure of birds and mammals is parallel . The final product of nitrogenous excretion in birds is mainly uric acid . Less than 10 per cent of the final product in the adult bird is urea and less than 15 per cent ammonia . The blood contains a low content of uric acid ( 5 mg per c.c. in the hen ) and this concentration is present in the glomerular filtrate . In the tubule the concentration is raised both by active secretion from the walls and by re-absorption of water , with the result that the uric acid , having a relatively low solubility , is either precipitated or may sometimes form a colloidal liquid suspension . The proportion of water absorbed varies with the condition of the bird . In the hen up to 98 ? 99 per cent may be absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being allowed to drink , or by injection of the antidiuretic hormone of the pituitary . The concentration of uric acid in the urine in the ureter ( precipitated or in colloidal solution ) may reach 20 per cent by weight . Its osmotic pressure is above that of the blood , presumably as the result of the action of the loop of Henle , but the difference ( twice at most in the hen ) is less than in many mammals ( p. 453 ) ; in one desert bird an osmotic pressure 4.4 times of the blood has been found ( 159 ) . The urine is passed down the ureter to the cloaca , which is 4 5 6 // divided into the same three parts as in the reptiles ( p. 304 ) ( Fig. 216 ) . As in the reptiles , the ureters and genital ducts open into the central part , the urodaeum . There is no bladder ( except in the ostrich ( 150 ) ) and no penis , but at copulation the swollen end of the male duct is extruded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ . In the proctodaeum there is a dorsal median diverticulum , the bursa Fabricii , which grows in relative size during development and regresses in the adult bird . In this it resembles the thymus and it has been suggested that it may have an endocrine function , as the thymus is said to have . Removal of it has no clear effect and its function , must be regarded as unknown . It is not used as a receptacle for the urine . It has been said that the urine in the cloaca may be passed back into the rectum and more water is absorbed from it there as well as in the cloaca . This has been denied and is doubtful . In the development of the chick in the egg , the excretion shows ? Ammonia // an interesting parallel with the course of evolution in vertebrates ( 118 ) . In the first four days of life , when the embryo is small , almost all the excretion is in the form of ammonia ( Fig. 217 ) in parallel with the large amount of ammonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gradually replaced after the fourth day by urea which reaches its maximum on the eighth and ninth days . From the tenth day onwards uric acid becomes the greater part of the excretion. 6 . HOMOTHERMY ( 89,90,97 ) * To have an internally controlled body temperature and one above that usual in the external environment but yet below the maximum at which the tissues can live without damage is clearly of advantage to an active animal.t With the raised body temperature metabolism can be at a higher rate than is possible in a cold-blooded animal , and the level of activity can be higher . It is doubtful whether active flight could have been evolved before the animal became homothermic ; gliding is the only form of flight we find in reptiles and fishes ? pterodactyls and other reptiles , flying fish ? except that one flying fish , Dactylopterus the flying gurnard , is said to prolong its glides by beating its wings . Another advantage of homothermy , and at least as important , is the greater independence of environmental change that it provides . Its evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps in the gradual freeing of the animal from the conditions of the environment which has been continuous throughout evolution . Constant temperature within the body will make for regular functioning of all the physiological systems ; it has been thought that the more advanced central nervous systems of birds and mammals could not function without it ( 8 ) . It is therefore not surprising that the two highest groups of vertebrates are both homothermic and that their body temperatures are not far below those at which vertebrate tissues are damaged ( 45 ? 50 ? C ) . // We may first consider the resting bird ; the conditions during flight are considered below ( p. 365 ) . The resting bird 's body temperature is not constant over the whole range of environmental temperatures to which it may be exposed . It is constant over a wide middle part of the range ( Fig. 218a , A-C ) . Above the upper limit of this range of constant tempera- ture at the point A , which is known as the upper critical point of external temperature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it reaches the upper lethal point . Below the lower limit of the constant temperature range ( C ) the body temperature falls and it continues to fall with decreasing temperature to the lower lethal point . The means by which the bird 's body temperature is controlled over the constant temperature range are of only two kinds . First , there are modifications of the metabolic rate by which the amount of heat produced within the body is controlled , and , secondly , there are various changes of behaviour , such as modifications of breathing , movement of die feathers and so on , by which the isolation of the body from the environment is altered and the amount of heat lost by diffusion and evaporation is controlled . Birds do not sweat and almost all the evaporative loss of heat is from the walls of the respiratory system . The walls of the air-sacs as well as those of the mouth , trachea and the spaces in the lungs are important in this respect . // Together these controls prevent change of body temperature over the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the range ( 97 ) . In the upper part of the constant temperature range , between the upper critical point ( A ) and a point known as the lower critical point ( B ) , changes in the behavioural controls are sufficient to keep the body temperature constant and the metabolic rate is unchanged ' . + ( Fig. 218b ) . In the part of the constant temperature range below the lower critical point , these controls are insufficient and the metabolic rate rises steadily at a rate which allows the body temperature to remain constant . At the lower limit of the constant temperature range ( C ) the metabolic rate has reached its maximum at the constant body temperature . Below this point with increasing loss of heat the body temperature falls and its fall is increased by the lower metabolic rate at the decreased body temperature . This goes on until the lethal temperature is reached . In the upper part of the constant temperature range , loss of heat by diffusion and evaporation becomes less as the external temperature approaches that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious reaction to the reduced loss of heat is a rise in the breathing rate ? from 55 per min. at 30 ? C in the pigeon to 200 or more . The bird begins to pant . A second react ion , distinct from panting , is observed in many birds . This is a fluttering of the floor of the mouth ( gular fluttering ) . Its function is to increase evaporation in the mouth by exchange of the air in it . In panting the breathing is much shallower than in normal respiration and it has been shown that the volume of ' air flowing in and out is only about three times the normal . The panting is not simply the normal breathing at a more rapid rate ; it is controlled from a centre in the mid-brain which does not control normal breathing . With further rise in the external temperature , even panting becomes ineffective and the metabolic rate rises rapidly with the higher body temperature . The body temperature then rises still further towards the lethal point . In birds the body temperature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C , in most birds between 39 ? and 41 ? . The upper lethal body temperature is about 46-47 ? C , and the lower lethal body temperature about 28 ? . The upper critical external temperature is usually about 37 ? , but the lower critical temperature is variable ( 163 ) In tropical birds it is about 25 ? , in birds of temperate regions it is often lower ? pigeon and sparrow 25 ? , hen 15 ? , geese 0 ? ? and in arctic birds it may be as low as - 30 ? or even lower . Panting usually begins at body temperatures between 41 ? and 43.5 ? . We know very little of the means by which the rate of metabolism // is controlled . Clearly the rate does not directly follow the changes in body temperature , for , as we have seen , in the lower part of the constant temperature range it increases while the body temperature remains constant . Shivering and active movements of the voluntary muscles occur in birds at low external temperatures . Both these will raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly other means of control . Heat is lost from the body by conduction from the skin as well as by evaporation . This heat loss is controlled in many ways . The coat of feathers reduces loss of heat from the skin by providing a layer of stagnant air through which conduction and radiation must take place . By raising the feathers the thickness of this layer can be increased and the conduction reduced ; birds fluff out their feathers in cold weather . On the other hand , if the feathers are raised so far that the stagnant layer is disturbed by currents , loss of heat will be increased , provided the air temperature is below that of the skin . Not all the body is covered with feathers ; in most birds parts of the head and of the legs as well as the feet are bare . In warmer regions , where increase of heat loss is the need , these parts of the body present no problem , but in cold conditions it is to the bird 's advantage to reduce loss of heat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting posture , or tucking the head under the wing , have this effect . An adaptation present in various birds ? penguins , wading birds , some arctic birds ? is to cool the arterial blood before it reaches the legs the tissues of which are adapted to live at a cool internal temperature ( 5-10 ? C ) . This is done by provision of arterio- venous retia rnirabilia ( Fig. 219 ) near the junctions of the legs with the laxly ( 162 ) . I n these retia small arterioles going to the legs run alongside small veins in which the blood is flowing in the opposite direction and exchange heat with them . After leaving the retia the arterial blood is at the low temperature and the legs supplied by it , also at this temperature , lose much less heat than they otherwise would , and the heat is preserved to the body in the blood of the veins. // Loss of heat from the skin may also be controlled by expansion and contraction of the blood vessels in it , but this control seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mammals . The temperature of the bird 's skin is in normal conditions about 35 ? C. Rather more than half the heat loss takes place from the skin ( 50 ? 70 per cent ) ; the rest is lost by evaporation . Since birds have no sweat glands , very little evaporation takes place from the skin and almost all the evaporative heat loss is from the respiratory organs , the airsacs and the passages leading to them . Together all these means of control are sufficient to account for maintenance of the body temperature over the wide middle range in which it is constant . They also account for the failure to maintain a constant body temperature in extreme hot and cold conditions . Much less is known of temperature control during flight . Many birds can fly for long periods and this implies that there can not be , in these birds at any rate , any continuous change of temperature during flight ; the bird must be in temperature equilibrium . Yet it is clear that the metabolism is greatly increased when the bird flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respiration is largely increased and the main function of this must be to supply the increased metabolism . But with the raised metabolism will go increased heat production and this heat must be lost from the body . Presumably most of the loss is by evaporation in the respiratory system owing to the more active breathing . Much of this heat loss is undoubtedly due to evaporation from the walls of the air-sacs as well as Drone other parts of the system . We have seen ( p. 342 ) heat the : Interior airsacs are not used while the bird is resting , and their use during ' light will help . Also , it may be that the current of ' air over the body increases the loss of heat from its surfaces and especially from the legs . 7 . TORPIDITY ( 13,109 ) Birds are not homothermic in all parts of their life-histories . In the earlier stages of the development they can not be , for the young have not then the organisation needed to control their temperature . In fact , there is normally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gastrula stage of development , during which it may be kept without damage at air temperature before incubation starts . In the fowl this period may be as long as two or three weeks ; in other birds it is often much shorter . Even during incubation both before and after hatching the young can stand larger variations of body temperature than the adult bird . Nevertheless , a warm temperature is necessary for the healthy development of the young in the nest , and // the nest may be regarded as an adaptation to provide a raised body temperature for the young at stages before they are able to provide it for themselves . Mammals satisfy this need in the young more efficiently by their viviparity . In a few adult birds , homothermic control of body temperature is lost in certain circumstances . This has been observed in some humming birds at night , seasonally ( in winter ) in an American goatsucker or nightjar , Phalaenoptilus , and in cold weather in some swifts . The birds are then torpid . In most other birds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a maximum of 4 ? , but the loss of temperature control in torpidity is a different phenomenon from this , for in normal birds the night temperature is still controlled though at a lower figure . In contrast , in the humming birds , swifts and goatsuckers the bird becomes temporarily poikilothermic and the body temperature is only a few degrees above that of the environment . Body temperatures of 5-10 ? C have been observed . Metabolism , pulse rate and breathing rate are greatly reduced . The condition is , in fact , closely parallel to that of hibernation in mammals ( p. 475 ) . The body temperature rises rapidly as the animal wakes ; a rise of 1.5 ? C per minute has been observed in the humming bird . The physiological background of this torpid condition is unknown . 8 . CONCLUSIONS It has been possible to cover only a few aspects of the biology of birds in this chapter . All their more elaborate behaviour , for example , has been omitted . It must suffice to say that the behaviour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals in being largely stereotyped in nature . Both groups have evolved elaborate behaviour in parallel . CHAPTER XVI THE REPTILIAN ANCESTRY OF MAMMALS 1 . SYNAPSIDA We have undeniable fossil evidence that the mammals evolved from the Synapsida , a group of reptiles which was earlier mentioned ( p. 275 ) as belonging to the Theropsida but was not further discussed . It was stated that the Theropsida are distinct from the other primary division of the reptiles , the Sauropsida , to which the Lepidosauria , the Archosauria and their descendants the birds belong . These two divisions were separate from near the origin of the reptiles , and the ancestry of mammals and birds was therefore unrelated from a very early stage in the history of the reptiles . Synapsids were present in the Upper Carboniferous and are therefore among the earliest reptiles known . Their only reptilian contemporaries at that time were the cotylosaurs ( pp. 264 70 ) . They were plentiful through the Permian and curly Triassic and survived into the Jurassic , by which time the cotylosaurs were extinct and the mesozoic radiation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the synapsids flourished therefore preceded that of the Sauropsids . Throughout their evolution the synapsids showed a gradual and continuous approach to mammalian organisation , until in the most evolved and latest forms it is not easy to draw a clear line between those that should be classified as synapsids and those that were already mammals . The group radiated strongly throughout its evolution , giving rise to many lines adapted to different habits . Our object in this chapter is to trace the evolution of mammalian characters in the group ; we shall not follow the course of evolution in all the lines . Rather , we shall compare examples of synapsids at different stages of their evolution and show their increasingly mammal-like structure . Several of the synapsid lines were vegetarian but , throughout the evolution , the lines most clearly leading towards the mammals were active carnivores ; it is these that we shall discuss . 367 // ( a ) Pelycosaurs ( 151,155 ) This primitive synapsid group is found in the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian of North America and Europe . Even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others carnivorous . Of the latter Varanosaurus ( Lower Permian ) ( Fig. 220 ) is an example . Varanosaurus was primitive and unspecialised even for a pelycosaur . It was a comparatively small animal , about 3 feet in length , lizard-like in form with a tail almost as long as the body ; other pelycosaurs , especially the vegetarian forms , were much larger and more specialised . These pelycosaurs were very close to the captorhinomorph cotylosaurs ( p. 265 ) . This is shown in their whole skeleton but especially in the skull ( Fig. 221 ) , in which the most obvious differences from the captorhinomorph skull were the higher and narrower shape and the presence of the diagnostic synapsid vacuity lying // ventrally behind the orbit ( p. 275 ) . All the bones of the primitive reptilian dermal roof were present except the intertemporal , but the postparietal , tabular and supratemporal had left the dorsal roof and formed parts of the back wall of the skull . As in the captorhinomorphs , the back wall was vertical and there was no sign of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone directed horizontally to near the quadrate articulation , and the tympanum , if present , must have been behind the skull , as in captorhinomorphs ( p. 266 ) . It retained this position throughout synapsid evolution and into the mammals . The presence of the tympanum in mammals is evidence of its persistence through the early reptiles and synapsids , unless we are to accept the view that it was lost in the captorhinomorphs and re-evolved in synapsids . This has been held by some . A septomaxillary was present in the nares , and a pineal opening between the parietals . The quadrate was a large bone in contact dorsally with the pterygoid and the otic capsule ; the quadratojugal was also well developed . In the palate there were teeth on the palatines and pterygoids and in some pelycosaurs on the vomers . The basipterygoid articulation was weak and movable , and the interpterygoid vacuity present but as only a narrow slit . The lower jaw ( Fig. 222 ) was in much the same condition as in the captorhinomorphs . The dentary covered one-half to two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Flit dentary was not far prolonged into a dorsal process as it was in later synapsids . On the inner face of the jaw the depression fiw the must-1e // closing the jaw , the adductor fossa ' , was large . There was a single splenial and in most pelycosaurs two coronoids . In the skeleton behind the skull a primitive feature was the persistence of small hypocentra ( p. 202 ) between the large pleurocentra . The vertebrae were amphicoelous . In the ventral abdominal wall gastralia were still present . The first two vertebrae behind the skull , axis and atlas , were still in the reptilian condition ( pp. 211 , 267 ) . Another characteristic feature of the synapsids , also present in some captorhinomorphs , was the presence of two ossifications in the ventral part of the cartilage of the shoulder girdle , an anterior procoracoid and a posterior coracoid ( Fig. 223 ) . The persistence of the cleithrum in many pelycosaurs was another primitive feature . The pelvic girdle was primitive and very like that of captorhinomorphs ; the ilium was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulated with two sacral vertebrae . The legs were more slender and longer than in captorhinomorphs but otherwise not very dilli.rent . They had the primitive sprawling gait with the humerus and femur more or less horizontal . The phalanges of both the fore and bind feet had a primitive reptilian formula-2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 3 in the litre feet and 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 4 in the hind , with the fourth digit the longest . These data show that pelycosaurs were still very primitive reptiles , in spite of ' their radiation into many different habits of life . Besides vegetarian and carnivorous forms it is possible that some were aquatic ; Varanosaurus is itself thought to have been a fish- // eater . They were close to the captorhinomorphs and there can be no doubt that these two groups were descended from the same early reptilian stock . At the same time the pelycosaurs are clearly synapsids . This is shown not only by their possession of characteristic synapsid characters such as the ventral vacuity in the dermal roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their having many other characters , not present in captorhinomorphs , which were present in later synapsids and further evolved in them . ( b ) Higher Synapsids ( 25,128,101,151 ) All the higher synapsids except some of the most mammal-like ( Ictidosauria , p. 376 ) are included in the order Therapsida which is divided into several suborders . We shall take examples ( 1 ) from a relatively primitive therapsid suborder , the Gorgonopsia , which flourished in the Middle and Upper Permian ( Scylacops ( 128 ) ; ( 2 ) from the Cynodontia , a suborder which was common in the Early Triassic and showed many advances over the gorgonopsians ( Cynognathus ( 25,151 ) ) ; and ( 3 ) from the Ictidosauria , in which the structure approaches very closely that of the mammals ( Oligokyphus ( 101 ) ) This last group is not known before the Upper Triassic . Their remains are rare and imperfect , but their closeness to the mammals makes it necessary to discuss them so f r as the data allow . // These three examples of the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phylogeny of the synapsid radiations is complicated and its course is not yet agreed . A recent interpretation is given in Fig. 224 ( 123 ) . The letters A ? E on the right of this figure represent the stages of the progression from the wholly reptilian structure of the pelycosaurs to the near-mammalian structure of the most advanced forms . Our examples come from stages B ? C ( Gorgonopsia ) , D ( Cynodonts ) , and E ( Ictidosaurs ) . ( A ) Skull ( 1 ) Gorgonopsia ( Scylacops ) ( 128 ) . The lateral view of the gorgonopsid skull ( Fig. 225b ) shows that the differentiation of the teeth into incisors , canines and cheek teeth , already present in the pelycosaurs , was further developed ; an arcade formed by the postorbital and jugal still separated the orbit from the synapsid vacuity ; the vacuity was enlarged as compared with the pelycosaurs both dorsally and posteriorly , presumably to allow greater space for the jaw muscles ( p. 275 ) ; the vacuity was surrounded on the dorsal side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of the bar below the vacuity where it meets the jugal , and downwards on the outside of the quadrate and quadratojugal . In the occipital view the interparietal and temporal cover large areas but the supratemporal is lost ; the condyle is single , formed by the basioccipital and the exoccipitals ; the suproccipital is large and extends laterally to a small posterior temporal vacuity between the dermal roof and the occipitals ; quadrate and quadratojugal are not visible in this view , being covered by the squamosal . In the dorsal roof there is a small median preparietal bone , a new element between the parietals and the frontals ; pre- and postfrontals are present and also septomaxillaries in the external nares ; there is a large pineal opening on a boss between the parietals . Ventrally the skull shows no evidence of a false palate such as was present in later synapsids ; there are a few teeth on the palatines and the pterygoids ; the pterygoids clasp the basipterygoid articulations immovably on each side of the parasphenoid which lies below the anterior part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were small and lay in a pocket on the anterior face of the squamosal , perhaps somewhat loosely ; the stapes was a horizontal bar with its inner end at the fenestra ovale and its distal end ventral and median to the quadrate recess . In most of these characters the skull is intermediate between the skulls of the pelycosaurs and the later synapsids . In the lower jaw of the gorgonopsians ( Fig. 226 ) the dentary extends over about two-thirds of the length of the jaw and bears a long dorsal process to which temporal muscles closing the jaw were attached . The postdentary bones were still large , and the articulation was still between the articular and the quadrate . The coronoid and the splenial were small . // ( 2 ) Cynodontia ( Cynognathus , Fig. 227 ) ( 25,151 ) . In the lateral view of the skull of Cynognathus ( Fig. 228A ) the following points may be noted . The synapsid vacuity is even larger than in the gorgonopsian skull and has expanded dorsally so that the roof between the vacuities is reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by the parietal as well as the postorbital and squamosal ; there is no postfrontal ; the postorbital arcade is still present and strong , and is still formed by the postorbital , squamosal and jugal ; the squamosal extends on to the jugal arcade and farther dorsally than in the gorgonopsians ; the teeth are well differentiated into incisors , canines and cheek teeth . I n the dorsal view a small pineal opening is present , but there is no preparietal . In the cciput the postparietal and tabulars are still large but the condyle is tending to become double , formed very largely by the exoccipitals , the basioccipital being small in this view ; the posttemporal vacuity is larger than in the gorgonopsians . In the ventral view we find the first appearance of a false palate formed by extensions of the maxillae and palatines to the middle line below the nasal passage . This extends more than half way be- // tween the front of the skull and the vacuities below the temporal region . It may have been extended farther back by a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore three cusps in a longitudinal row . The epipterygoid has become fused into the wall of the braincase and is not a free column as in more primitive forms . The quadrate and quadratojugal are small and lie close against the squamosal in the posterior wall of the vacuity . The tympanum is believed to have been close behind the quadrate . In the lower jaw ( Fig. 228E ) the dentary has come to cover almost the whole outer face and the postdentary bones lie on the inner surface of the dentary much reduced in size and around a groove in which Meckel 's cartilage must have lain . The dorsal process of the dentary was very large . The articulation was still between the articular and quadrate ; the dentary did not articulate with the squamosal. ( 3 ) Ictidosauria ( Oligokyphus ) ( 101 ) The ictidosaurs are a varied and perhaps unnatural group ( Fig. 224 , p. 371 ) , in which several of the most mammal-like therapsids are included . They are far less well known than the cynodonts . The skeleton is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed ( Fig. 229 ) ? from the basal Jurassic of England and in hardly any others . Bienotherium ( 2o6 ) is another form from strata of the same age in China . Both these show a large advance towards mammalian structure . In the side view of the skull one of the marked changes from the // cynodont skull is the increase in the size of the temporal region as compared with the face , giving larger space for the brain within . The postorbital bar has disappeared ? so that the orbit and the vacuity are confluent ; it was incomplete in some lower synapsids ( Bauria ) . The vacuity is again greatly enlarged , and the median wall above it , formed by the parietal and squamosal , is drawn out in a high sagittal crest . There can be no doubt that this continuous enlargement of the vacuity in synapsid history was to give greater space for the temporal muscles ( pp. 275 ? 6 ) which closed the jaw in biting , and the crest also served for their attachment . Prefrontals and postorbitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still present . The teeth are more specialised than in cynodonts . Between the front teeth , incisors and canines , and the cheek teeth there is a large space ( diastemma ) , and the cheek teeth have broad cusped crowns somewhat similar to those of mammals . The cheek teeth were rooted ( p. 382 ) . In the dorsal view ( C ) the most striking feature is the wide bow of the jugal arcade , allowing a large space within it for the jaw muscles . The pineal foramen is absent ; the external nares are joined in a single opening ; the condyles are double and formed by the exoccipitals . In all these features the skull resembles that of a mammal , but it differs from a mammalian skull in that the interparietal and tabular are still large in the occiput ( D ) , the post-temporal fenestra is present though small , and the articulation of the jaw is still between articular and quadrate . In the ventral view ( B ) the false palate formed by the maxillae and palatines is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As in cynodonts , the false roof may have been continued backwards as a soft palate . The pterygoid is strongly fused to the braincase and the epipterygoid is in the wall of the braincase , as in cynodonts and in mammals where it forms the alisphenoid . There are no processes of the pterygoid connecting it with the quadrate . All these features of the ventral view of the skull are in the direction of mammalian structure . ( i ) Vertebral Column . In pelycosaurs the column was , as we noted , of a primitive reptilian type . The vertebrae were hollowed at both ends ( amphicoelous ) and small hypocentra were present in the cervical and dorsal regions . In therapsids there is a tendency for the vertebrae to evolve towards the flat-ended ( amphiplatyan ) mammalian condition and the hypocentra are lost from the body region , though they may still be present in the neck . The capitulum of the rib is on the hypocentrum where it is present and , in forms in which the hypocentrum is lost , on the edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelycosaurs , three generally in therapsids , four in some cynodonts . The atlas and axis complex remains reptilian in the synapsids ( Fig. 231 ) . In their evolution the complex shows little fundamental change from the pelycosaur condition , and no synapsid has the pleurocentrum of the first vertebra fused on to the second vertebra to form the odontoid process ( p. 211 ) . That is a character of mammals . ( c ) Locomotion . In the evolution between the pelycosaurs and therapsids , and therefore early in synapsid history , the manner of walking or running was fundamentally altered from t hat t ypical of reptiles to something very like that of the mammals . The evidence of this is given by the large changes that occurred in the structure of the limbs and girdles . Elbows and knees were turned ill towards the body , the elbows backwards and the knees forwards , so that the legs came to lie under the body rather than away from it at the sides . The humerus and femur were no longer horizontal and were no longer rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progression was produced by straightening and bending the legs at the elbows and knees and swinging the whole limb backwards in a vertical plane . We shall discuss this form of locomotion in more detail when we come to consider it in the mammals ( p. 461 ) . Here it need only be noted that this was a fundamental change that resulted in a large improvement in the locomotion of an actively running animal , and that it occurred early in synapsid history . We may note the structural changes that resulted from it . ( D ) Shoulder Girdle and Fore Limb . In the shoulder girdle two coracoids are present in all therapsids . A remnant of the cleithrum may be present in the less advanced therapsids . In the evolution of the // group the scapula tends to become long and thin and an acromion process develops on its front edge . This edge also tends to thicken and turn outwards , forming the beginning of the mammalian spine , but there was never in therapsids any development of a region in front of the spine comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girdle of Oligokyphus is shown in Fig. 232 . The fore limb shows modifications correlated with the change in locomotion . In the lower reptiles the glenoid articulation of the limb faces outwards in line with the length of the humerus ; in therapoids it comes to face obliquely backwards facing the humerus ( Fig. 232 ) . The radius and ulna are already twisted over each other by 90 ? ( p. 197 ) in the lower reptiles so as to bring the foot forwards ; this twist is increased by a further 90 ? when the elbow is turned backwards . There is some development of the olecranon process of the ulna at the back of its proximal end ; to this the muscles extending the fore-arm are attached ( p. 285 ) . On the humerus the articular surface is a rounded knob on the inside of the bone , not in line with its length , and the trochanters for the attachment of muscles are further developed , coming to resemble the arrangement in the mammels ( p. 419 ) . The fore-feet have the mammalian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3 , ) in the most advanced therapsids , but traces of the lost phalanges arc present in some cynodonts . The toes are generally of about equal length . This results from the weight of the body being spread equally over them owing to the foot being under the body ; in the lower reptiles the pressure is greater on the outer toes , and the fourth toe is usually the longest . // The sternum is ossified in some therapsids but not in pelycosaurs . In Oligokyphus there is a small separate presternal ossification and the sternum shows signs of becoming divided into segmental sternebrae similar to those of mammals . ( E ) Pelvic Girdle and Limb . In the therapsid pelvic girdle the most striking development is the elongation of the ilium . The articulation of the sacrum is at its front end and that of the limb ( acetabulum ) some distance farther back . This alteration of the form of the ilium becomes more marked with the evolution of the group ; it is greatest in the icitidosaurs ( Fig. 233 ) . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attached ( iliofemoralis which becomes the gluteus muscle of mammals , cf. p. 434 ) . In reptiles it moved the femur backwards , being attached near the acetabulum . As in the birds ( p. 318 ) , where the hind limb has nearly the same position as in the higher synapsids and mammals , the head of the femur is on the inside of the bone , not at its end , and in line with its length . In ictidosaurs a neck behind the head oh the femur similar to that in mammals has been described . The acetabulum lies between the pubis and ischium , which are about equally developed . There is a tendency for the enlargement of the obturator foramen between the pubis and ischium in synapsid evolution . In the tarsus there is a tendency in some therapsids ( e.g. Bauria ) for the calcaneum , the fibulare of reptiles ( p. 268 ) , to be enlarged backwards and so to resemble the heel-bone of mammals . As in the fore-foot the toes have in advanced therapsids the mammalian phalangeal formula ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . MESOZOIC MAMMALS ( a ) The Class Mammalia We must now discuss the evidence for the presence in mesozoic times of animals that were clearly mammals and not synapsid reptiles . But first it is necessary to be clear on what grounds we // differentiate mammals from those that we regard as being still reptiles . We have seen that the higher synapsids approached closely to mammalian structure in many characters , and later we shall see that they probably possessed many other mammalian characters about which the fossils give us no evidence . But there are at least four characters which are typical of mammals and not present in any synapsid ( 168 ) . These may be regarded as diagnostic of mammals . We may tabulate them thus : It is perhaps unfortunate that these characters are all concerned in the reorganisation of the jaw suspension and the middle ear , but this is one of the most important features of the later stages of mammalian evolution . And they are characters that can be recognised in the very incomplete fossil evidence of the highest synapsids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distinguishing between the forms that we must call reptiles and those that we recognise as mammals , but it must be accepted that any line of distinction in a case such as this where the evolution was gradual and continuous must be artificial . There are other characters which might be used if our evidence were better . One is the presence of an odontoid process on the axis , but we have not the evidence to say that this was present in the earliest mammals . There are also some characters which are characteristic of mammals but are known to be present , in at least rudimentary forms , in some of the most advanced synapsids . Thus , rooted cheek teeth , that is to say teeth that are not widely open at the base as the incisors and canines are even in mammals and all teeth were in the lower reptiles , but have at the base two or more roots with narrowed openings to the pulp cavity , were previously thought to be diagnostic of mammals . But we have seen that in Oligokyplius the cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a tendency // towards development of roots in the teeth of other advanced synapsids . This character therefore gives no clear line of distinction . Even the four characters tabulated above require some qualification . For instance , it is known that in at least one ictidosaur , Diarthrognathus , a dentary-squamosal articulation was present as well as the quadrate-articular , both articulations being close to each other and forming a single suspension of the jaw . A similar double articulation is also believed to have been present in the early mammal morganucodonts ( s2 ) . Exceptions such as these are to be expected if the evolution was gradual and continuous . The fact that several synapsid groups were evolving towards mammalian status , as is shown in Fig. 224 ( p. 371 ) , makes this still more likely . There was in fact in many synapsid lines a gradual tendency to acquire mammalian characters . This can only have been by parallel evolution . It is another example of the type of evolution that we have found already in the actinopterygian fishes ( pp. 150ff. ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaeontological evidence is in favour of the belief that more than one of these lines evolved into mammals , so that the early mesozoic mammals were evolved polyphyletically from several groups of synapsids ; different groups of synapsids independently crossed the line separating reptiles from mammals . If tins is accepted , it raises the question of how the class Mammalia should be regarded as a division in the systematic classification of animals . The classical view of the nature of a unit of ' classification has been , ever since the theory of evolution was generally accepted , that earl ( unit should contain all the members of a single monophyletic line , i.e. all the animals descended from a single common ancestral species . Clearly if our palaeontological evidence of polyphyletic origin is accepted this is not true of the mammals . I f the Mammalia is to be retained as a group defined in the classical manner , we should have either to include in the Mammalia only one of these polyphyletic lines of mesozoic mammals ' , excluding all the rest ? and also the monotremes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther back so as to include the common ancestors of all the synapsid groups that gave rise to what are usually called mesozoic mammals , and that would be logical only if we may assume the synapsids to be monophyletic . Neither of these alternatives seems acceptable to most present-day zoologists . It can not be denied that one of the purposes of classification is to serve the convenience of zoologists as well as to express , as far as may be , the course of evolution . What is clear about all the animals that are usually included in the Mammalia is that they all possess a similar organisation of the body and that this is expressed // in a very large number of characters . For this reason it is convenient that they should all be included in the Mammalia and that synapsids which do not possess this organisation in full should be excluded from it . It is therefore becoming generally recognised that the class Mammalia should be regarded not as a group limited by a common phylogeny but as a grade , a group including all animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This involves a considerable modification of the basis of zoological classification in this case . But the descent of mammals from reptiles is the large step in vertebrate evolution of which we have the most detailed knowledge , the evidence previously given makes it possible that other vertebrate groups may be polyphyletic and should be reinterpreted in the same sense ( cf. pp. 223ff . ) . It seems , then , that this modification of the concepts of zoological systematics must be accepted , at least for the vertebrates . ( b ) The Groups of Mesozoic Mammals ( 132,147,167 ) In the Rhaetic ( at the Triassic Jurassic boundary ) two groups ( orders ) of early mammals are found . These are the symmetrodonts and the pantotheres , of which last only one family , the docodonts , were present at that time . * In the middle Jurassic the number of orders is increased to four by the addition of triconodonts and multituberculates and other families of pantotheres as well as the docodonts occur . Except that the symmetrodonts and pantotheres were probably related in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently from the synapsids . Of the orders the pantotheres are of most interest to us for they were almost certainly the ancestors of the marsupials and the placentals . The other groups are believed to be side branches of synapsid-mammalian evolution . They gave rise to no later forms . We are fortunate in also having the monotremes to throw light on this evolution . They are mammals but retain reptilian structure in many of their characters . We have no fossil evidence of them before the Pleistocene . They are believed to have been derived by another independent evolution from the synapsids and not to have descended from any of the known groups of mesozoic mammals . They are certainly more distant from all other mammals than any of these are from each other . They will be discussed in the next chapter . Fossil evidence of the mesozoic mammals is poor . It comes mainly from a few localities in England and North America of Jurassic // and Cretaceous dates , and consists of teeth , lower jaws , parts of the skull and a few leg bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not known above the Jurassic , symmetrodonts have been found in the Cretaceous as well as the Jurassic , triconodonts have been recorded from the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous , and multituberculates were far the longest lived , surviving into the Tertiary ( Eocene ) . All these early mammals were relatively small animals ; they varied from the size of a rather small dog to that of a rat or mouse . They were all actively running terrestrial animals , and many were perhaps arboreal . Some were vegetarian , others carnivorous , feeding probably on insects or small invertebrates , or omnivorous . From the nature of the deposits in which they are found it seems probable that most of them lived in forested or swampy regions . Such habitats would in mesozoic times have been inhabited by the then dominant reptiles , such as the dinosaurs . These were of all sizes from the well-known large forms downwards . It seems probable that the mammals escaped the competition of these reptiles by their small size and by leading inconspicuous lives among the vegetation . It is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the whole of the mesozoic period , some 150 million years , and did not succumb to the causes ? whatever they may have been - that caused the extinction of so many reptilian groups at the end of ' the Cretaceous . And the pantotheres , though they themselves died out at the top of the Jurassic , gave rise to marsupials and placentals which survived through the Cretaceous into the Tertiary , and then radiated into the varied groups of modern mammals . The orders of these early mammals are most clearly distinguished by the characters of the dentitions . In all the orders the teeth were well differentiated into incisors , canines and cheek teeth , which were divided into premolars and molars and , in contrast with synapsid teeth , were always rooted . But the patterns of the crowns of the molars differed in the four orders . ( A ) Order Multituberculata . The animals of this group ( Fig. 234 ) were specialised to vegetarian habits . They reached the largest size of any mesozoic mammals . They were still common in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tertiary periods . They are the most distinct of the mesozoic orders and are often placed in a separate subclass , the Allotheria . The teeth are highly specialised to the vegetarian habit . The chisel-like incisors ( Fig. 234 ) show adaptation analogous to those of placental rodents . The molars ( Fig. 235 ) were unlike those of any other mammals . They were elongate with either two or three longi-0 // A Figure 234 . Skull ( A ) and side view of head ( B ) in a multituberculate ( Ctenacodon ) . ( From Simpson ) tudinal lines of cusps . They were adapted to either grinding or shearing . In many ( e.g. Ptilodus ) the last lower premolar was enlarged into a highly specialised striated cutting blade ( Fig. 234 ) . Microtuberculates were the most successful of the mesozoic orders innumbers as well as in the period of their survival , but there is no doubt that they were a specialised side branch of the mammals from which no later groups were evolved . At the end of the Lower Eocene they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . In them and in other mesozoic orders the brain was little evolved from the reptilian condition , and this may have been one of the reasons why they died out after the Eocene . ( s ) Order Triconodonta . This group , from the Middle and Upper // Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous , had molars with another pattern peculiar to them and not present in any other mammals . Their molars bore a single longitudinal line of three cusps of which the central was the largest ( Fig. 235 ) . These teeth differed in another character from those of pantotheres and later mammals . The teeth of the two jaws did not close opposite each other at the bite ; the lower jaw closed inside the upper , giving a shearing action between the two ( Fig. 236 ) . Triconodonts were a carnivorous side branch which ( lid not evolve further . ( c ) Order Pantotheria . Except for the docodonts which are said to occur in the Rhaetic ( p. 384 ) , pantotheres ( Fig. 237 ) are known only from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to teeth and jaws . They were small mammals probably mainly carnivorous , feeding on small animals , but perhaps also on seeds and other vegetable food . The docodonts are specialised with molars adapted for crushing food ; they probably fed on harder material . This family need not concern us . The chief reason for believing that the pantotheres were ancestral // to the marsupials and placentals is that the pattern of the crowns of their molar teeth was of a type from which the patterns of the teeth of these later mammals can be easily derived . The conclusion that this was the course of mammalian evolution is supported by some other features , especially in the form of the jaws . The molar teeth of the pantotheres were triangular in both the upper and lower jaws ( Fig. 235 ( 187 ) ; cf. also Fig. 252 , p. 412 ) . In the upper teeth the apex of the triangle ( trigon ) was on the inner side . In the lower teeth the apex of the triangle , trigonid , was on the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close together on the outer side and those of the lower jaw on the inner side , but there were spaces between them on the inside of the upper jaw and the outside of the lower . In both jaws there were three cusps in the triangle , one at its apex and two at its base . In the upper molars the cusp at the apex of the triangle of the trigon is called the protocone , those at the base the paracone ( anterior ) and the metacone ( posterior ) ; in the lower jaw the apical cusp is called the paraconid , those at the base the paraconid ( anterior ) and metaconid ( posterior ) . Between the cusps was a basin at a lower level , and round the edge of the tooth was a low ridge , the cingulum . In the upper molars there was in some teeth a projection at the outer anterior corner at a lower level than the central basin of the crown , and in the lower molars always a projection ( talonid ) at the inner posterior corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These teeth differed from those of triconodonts in that the upper // molars did not bite wholly outside the lower , and there was not a shearing action between the two faces of the teeth as they slid past each other . In pantotheres ( Fig. 238 ) the lower molars passed at the bite into the triangular spaces between the upper molars . The cusp of the upper molar on the inner apex of the trigon bore against the talonid of the lower molar ( Fig. 239 , A ) and gave a piercing action . There was also a shearing action between the posterior face of the lower molar and the anterior face of the tipper molar hehind it . And there may also have been some crushign action between the trigon of the upper tooth and the trigonid of the lower tooth ( Fig. 239 , B ) . It is this complex action of these teeth allowing them to act on the food in so many different ways that made it possible for the pattern to be modified in placental evolution into teeth specialised for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marsupials and placentals have teeth of this pattern , though they become in many much more complex . And pantotheres , so far as they are known , possess no other characters that would exclude them from being ancestral to either group of the modern mammals . Further , none of the special characters that differentiate marsupials from placentals are known to have occurred in the pantotheres . So it seems that we have no reason to think them to have been ancestral to one but not the other of the later mammalian groups . It is therefore believed that both marsupials and placentals were evolved from forms closely related to the known pantotheres , presumably by // evolution along independent lines . Apart from other characters , all other known mesozoic mammals are excluded by the patterns of their teeth from the ancestry . ( D ) Order Symmetrodonts . These occur in the Rhaetic , but are known chiefly from the Middle and Upper Jurassic and have also been found in the Middle Cretaceous , after which they died out . Their teeth ( Fig. 235 ) were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no talonid on the lower molars and their action was therefore less complex . Symmetrodonts were probably carnivorous . They were a side branch of the same stock as the pantotheres . They left no later descendants . 3 . SUMMARY The history of the mesozoic mammals , so far as the poverty of the palaeontological evidence allows us to give an account of it , seems to have been as follows . In the Triassic several groups of the most advanced synapsids completed their evolution towards mammalian organisation , each giving rise to a group of animals that we can call mammals . Four of these mammalian groups are known to us . Two of them , which were probably more closely related than the rest , symmetrodonts and pantotheres ( docodonts ) , first appear in the Rhaetic ( if the Rhaetic forms previously believed to be docodonts were such and not triconodonts ( p. 384 ) ) at the junction of the Triassic and the Jurassic ; the others , multituberculates and triconodonts ( and the pantotheres apart from the questionable docodonts ) , have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be because the localities in which these fossil mammals occur are very few . In the Middle and Upper Jurassic all four groups occur , and seem at that time to have been relatively successful , radiating into a considerable number of species . But at the end of the Jurassic or in the Cretaceous all except the multituberculates became extinct . The multituberculates radiated again in the Upper Cretaceous and survived into the Tertiary . They occur in the Paleocene and the Lower Eocene but not later . Some time in the Jurassic marsupials and placentals evolved from the pantotheres or from forms very like them . The evolution of these new groups was complete by the Upper Cretaceous in which we find marsupial opossums very little different from the modern forms and insectivores with the characteristic features of that placental order as we know it today . These ? and the multituberculates ? // survived when the majority of reptilian groups became extinct towards the end of the Cretaceous , and in the early Tertiary the placentals and marsupials gave rise to the radiations in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived through some 150 million years of mesozoic times , a period quite twice as long as the whole period of the dominance of the mammals in the Tertiary . They seem to have survived by leading inconspicuous lives , some vegetarian and some carnivorous , largely out of the competition of the dominant reptiles . During that time animals were evolved that differed hardly at all from the organisation we find in the more primitive living mammals . CHAPTER XVII MONOTREMES MONOTREMATA In our attempts to work out the course of evolution by which mammals evolved from reptiles we are fortunate in having , besides the whole series of the Synapsida , the monotremes , living animals intermediate between mammals and reptiles in both structure and physiology . The monotremes ( 53,55,127 ) are known only as the living forms ( Fig. 240 ) , the platypus Ornithorhynchus and two general of monotreme anteaters , Tachyglossus and Z'aglossus ( both previously called Echidna ) , together with some Pleistocene fossil material of forms closely related to the living genera . , Zaglossus lives in New Guinea , the other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of their history before the Pleistocene . Monotremes are placed in the Mammalia ? as a separate subclass , the Prototheria ? since they possess a large number of almost typically mammalian characters . At the same time some of their organs such as the shoulder girdle , the eye and the urogenital system are typically reptilian . Moreover , many of their mammalian organs have some details of reptilian structure , and some of the reptilian organs mammalian details . They are thus clearly intermediate between the mammals and reptiles. 392 // All the living monotremes are highly specialised in adaptation to their habits . The platypus is aquatic and digs deep and branching burrows in the banks of the rivers in which it lives . In these burrows nests are made . The adult has many adaptations to swimming and burrowing . Its food consists of small animals ? molluscs , insects , crustacea , etc. ? which it gathers from the mud on the floor of its habitat . In adaptation to this feeding habit the bill is ribbed on its inside like that of a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for straining off the mud taken up with the food . In contrast , the anteaters are terrestrial and adapted to rapid burrowing and to ant-eating . Like other mammals that feed on ants , they show adaptation to this food in loss of teeth ( also reduced but highly modified in Ornithorhynchus ) , a long pointed snout and a sticky tongue to which the ants adhere . The special adaptations of the two types need not concern us further . Most zoologists ( e.g. 55,127 ) believe that the monotremes are descended from a sidebranch of the evolution of mammals that probably diverged in the Triassic or early Jurassic . It has been suggested that their ancestry may have been among the triconodonts ( p. 386 ) , but this view is not generally accepted ; they may more probably be descended from none of the known groups of mesozoic mammals . A different view has been put forward by Gregory who has maintained that they are divergent marsupials . I le regards most of their reptilian characters as juvenile or embryonic characters preserved in the adult by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall accept the opinion of the majority thatt they represent an early divergent mammalian line derived horn unknown mesozoic mammals . ( 1 ) Mammalian Characters Some of the characters of the monotremes that are wholly or predominantly mammalian are : ( 1 ) The skull ( 15 ) in both types of monotremes ( Fig. 241 ) is mammalian in most of its features . The articulation of the jaw is between the dentary and the squamosal , and the articular and quadrate have passed into the middle ear to form the malleus and incus ( p. 411 ) . But the tympanic is less developed than in other mammals ; it forms an incomplete ring round the middle ear and there is no bulla . The false plate is of mammalian form and stretches back nearly to the level of the glottis . In the dermal roof the number of bones is reduced ; pre- and postfrontals and postorbitals are missing . The epipterygoid ? the alisphenoid of mammals ? is joined , as in mammals , with dermal bones in the surface of the skull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space , the cavum epiptericum , as in reptiles , but not mammals ( Fig. 242 ) . There is a large ossification in the side wall of the braincase in this region , the orbitosphenoid ( p. 406 ) . On the other hand there are numerous details in the skull in which the structure is nearer to the skull of reptiles than to that of other mammals . One is the persistence of the cavum epiptericum , just mentioned . In marsupials and placentals the inner wall of this space , the primitive wall of the braincase , is represented only by a membrane and the space is confluent with the brain cavity ( Fig. 242 ) . Again , in the back wall of the skull , between the otic capsules and the dermal roof , the reptilian posterior temporal vacuities ( p. 372 ) are still present as small openings . They are closed in all other mammals . A small bone , the os paradoxum ( or dumb-bell shaped bone ' ) , is present in Ornithorhynchus in front of the false palate and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now believed to be derived from processes of the premaxillae ( 15 ) . The mammalian vomer is probably the fused reptilian vomers , and is present in monotremes in the normal mammalian position . The reptilian ectopterygoid is present in Tachyglossus as a small bone lateral to the pterygoid ( ' Echidna pterygoid ' ) . This is probably fused into the pterygoid in other mammals . ( 2 ) The brain is mammal-like but less evolved . There at t. optic lobes ( corpora quadrigemina ) , as in mammals , instead of the two of reptiles . The pallium is unconvoluted in Olnithwhynrhus , but convoluted in Tachyglossus. ( 3 ) In the vertebral column there are seven cervical vertebrae as in other mammals and the pleurocentrurn of the atlas is fused in the adult to the axis forming the odontoid peg , but the cervical vertebrae bear free ribs and the anterior and posterior faces of the centra of the vertebrae ( pleurocentra ) are not covered with thin plates of bone , the epiphyses , as in other mammals , except in the tail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the centra of the vertebrae. ( 4 ) The heart is completely divided in the mammalian manner ( p. 423 ) . The blood corpuscles are smaller than in reptiles and unnucleated . The circulation is generally mammalian . ( 5 ) The pleural cavities are separated from the general body cavity by a diaphragm which is formed in much the same way as in other mammals ( p. 429 , ) . The breathing is mammalian . ( 6 ) Sweat glands are present , but not plentiful . They are found on the beak or Ornithorhycnhus , and are said to be present in both // types of monotremes scattered thinly over the body . Sebaceous glands giving an oily secretion are present in the skin of all the monotremes. ( 7 ) All the monotremes are homothermic , but the control of temperature is less perfect than in other mammals ( 111 ) . As the external temperature falls from 35 ? to 5 ? C the internal temperature of Ornithorhynchus falls by 5 ? C and that of Tachyglossus by 10 ? . Monotremes have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not pant . Since their sweating is apparently rudimentary , their only physiological control of the internal temperature seems to be by shivering ( p. 470 ) . They die when the external temperature rises to 40 ? C. ( 8 ) All monotremes possess typical mammalian hair ( p. 421 ) . The hair of Ornithorhynchus consists of a fine inner coat and a outer coat of coarser hair . In the anteaters strong protective spines are also present . As in other mammals , their hair must be useful in preventing loss of heat when the environment is cold and in reducing rise of body temperature when the environment is hotter than the body ( cf. pp. 469-70 ) . ( 9 ) The structure of the kidneys and their circulation is mammalian ( pp. 428 , 453 ) . ( 10 ) Mammary glands are present in all female monotremes , and , as in other mammals , are believed to be modified sweat glands . The glands open by numerous openings on an area of the skin of the belly ? in the anteaters within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) Reptilian Characters In these many characters , both structural and physiological , monotremes agree with other mammals , except for some minor features in which they preserve reptilian organisation . We must now consider the parts of the body in which the organisation is predominantly reptilian ( 31 ) . ( 1 ) Shoulder girdle and fore limb . The general form of the girdle is entirely reptilian ( Fig. 243 ) . The scapula bears a marked acromion and has a ridge on its anterior border , but we have seen ( p. 380 ) that both these features also occur in the synapsids . There is no fi , rwanl extension of the scapula ( supraspinous area ) in front of the ridge as in other mammals . There are two coracoids . The interclavicle is large and T-shaped and the clavicle strong and attached to the front edge of the T. The sternum is undivided in its front part , but behind this it is divided into sternebrae , as in mammals . To these the ribs are attached . We have seen that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternebrae in ictidosaurs ( Oligokyphus , p. 381 ) . The posture of the fore limb is more like that of an early synapsid than that of later members of the group ; the humerus is more or less horizontal and the limb is not carried under the body . The whole limb is strong and adapted in Ornithorhynchus to swimming , it is used to paddle the animal along much as a man swims when using the breast stroke ( 28 ) . Another adaptation to this habit in Ornithorhynchus is the form of the glenoid cavity , which is very peculiar . It is elongate in the anterior-posterior direction and the head of the humerus slips backwards and forwards along it as the limb moves . In the anteaters the fore limb is equally strong and used flu ? digging , which is carried out by movements very like those of Ornithorhynchus in swimming . The apparently primitive features of the limb and girdle have led to the suggestion ( 7576 ) that the tnonotretnes could not have been evolved from the higher synapsids , but must have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more probable that these features are special adaptations to the swimming and burrowing habits of the animals in the evolution of which , perhaps , neoteny played a part . ( 2 ) Pelvic girdle and limb . The girdle has a reptilian form with the ilium almost vertical ( p. 315 ) . Pubis and ischium are both large and the obturator foramen ( p. 381 ) between them is large and mammallike . In both types of monotreme paired prepubic bones are present in front of the pubis , in the same position as the marsupial bones of marsupials . In anteaters these support the wall of the pouch ; Ornithorhynchus has no pouch . In the male Ornithorhynchus a poison claw is borne on a small bone attached to the tarsus . ( 3 ) The eye is generally reptilian in its detailed structure but // has a few mammalian features ( 184 ) . Thus , the conus papillaris of reptilian eyes ( p. 298 ) is absent , the retina being supplied by blood vessels in the choroid ; the superior oblique muscle does not end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lower vertebrates , but passes through a pulley on the wall ( Fig. 244 ) and is attached ventrally ; and the ciliary processes are connected by a web between them . These are characters in which the mammalian eye differs from that of reptiles , except that a vestigial conus papillaris occurs in some marsupials. ( 4 ) Urogenital system ( Fig. 245 ) ( 85,127 ) . Here the structure is essentially reptilian . This is shown very clearly by the persistence in d. // monotremes of a cloaca composed of three parts ( p. 304 ) , an ectodermal posterior part ( proctodaeum ) and two endodermal anterior parts ( urodaeum and coprodaeum ) . But the urinary and genital ducts open into the bladder duct near its opening into the bladder , not directly into the urodaeum as in most reptiles . ( In some chelonians ( p. 304 ) there is a similar migration of the openings of these ducts on to the duct of the bladder . ) The bladder duct opens into the ventral wall of the urodaeum by a pore through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cylindrical penis on the ventral wall of the urodaeum surrounded by a sheath , and a duct connected with the urinary duct runs through this penis . By this duct the sperm is ejaculated , the urinary opening being closed at the time of the ejaculation . ( This is parallel to the groove in the ventral wall of the urodaeum of chelonians along which the sperm is ejaculated , but in them no closed sperm duct and no sheath of the penis is formed . ) In the monotremes , and also in the chelonians , erectile tissue similar to that of the mammalian penis is present round the sperm duct or groove , and the organ duct can be extruded at copulation into the cloaca and out through the anus . The whole structure is clearly intermediate between the rudimentary penis of the chelonians and the structure in the higher mammals ( pp. 453111 ) . In the female monotreme the urogenital system is still less modified from that of the reptile . The oviducts open directly to the cloaca . The egg passes from the ovary across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cloaca and the anus. ( 3 ) Ovulation The manner in which the egg leaves the ovary in monotremes is intermediate between the ways in which tins occurs in reptiles and mammals ( 47 ) . In reptiles the ripening egg ( p. 306 ) lies in the cavity of the ovary and is covered by the follicular epithelium which also forms a stalk by which the egg is attached to the ovarian wall ( Fig. 246 , A ) . At ovulation the egg breaks through the ovarian wall at the position of the stalk . In all mammals including the monotremes the egg lies in the solid substance of the ovary ( Fig. 246 , B , C ) . In mammals other than the monotremes ( B ) the egg is small and a large cavity , the follicular cavity , is formed between it and the wall of the follicle , the egg being attached to the wall on one side of the cavity . This cavity is filled with liquid . At ovulation the wall of the follicle breaks through the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg is carried with it . In monotremes the ovarian egg is much larger than in other mammals ? 3.5 ? 5 mm in diameter at ovulation ? and the follicular // wall thicker . A small crescentic follicular cavity is formed on the side of the egg away from the surface of the ovary . At ovulation the egg breaks its way through the ovarian wall , probably being pushed out by increase of the fluid in the cavity behind it . Here again the monotremes clearly represent an intermediate stage between the reptilian and mammalian types of organisation . ( 4 ) Reproduction ( 28,55 ) The egg in both Ornithorhynchus and Tachyglossus , when laid , is about 15 x 13 mm in diameter ; it grows in size by absorption of yolk material as it passes down the oviduct , where an albumen layer and the shell are also formed . The shell is thin and horny but also contains calcareous material in Ornithorhynchus . In Tachyglossus a single egg is laid at a time ; in Ornithorhynchus , two . After being laid the eggs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there incubated by the mother ; the egg of Tachyglossus is placed in the pouch . They develop before and after hatching in these positions . ' Hie cleavage ( 24 ) is meroblastic ; the yolk is contained in a large yolk-sac and a large allantois is formed , but , naturally , there is no sign of an allantoic placenta . Hatching is assisted by an eggtooth on the upper surface of the snout . This is hard , containing bone , and sharp ; a similar egg-tooth occurs in lizards and snakes . There is also another projection , the caruncle , just behind the egg-tooth on the snout . This is soft and apparently not used at hatching . It occurs in many reptiles , but no reptile has both these organs . // After hatching the young are kept in the nest of Ornithorhynchus or the pouch of Tachyglossus for many days . In Ornithorhynchus the mother does not lactate until some days after hatching ; presumably the young are still feeding on the yolk at this time . In all monotremes the milk is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the area of the belly on to which they open . It is there licked up by the young . It is said that the caruncle of the young is used to stimulate the mother to secrete milk by being rubbed on the belly surface and moved about ? the egg-tooth has by this stage disappeared . In their reproduction the monotremes show almost equal numbers of mammalian and reptilian characters , so that it is hard to say whether the reproduction is mainly reptilian or mainly mammalian . The form of the egg , the presence of an egg-shell , the egg-tooth and the caruncle , the meroblastic development are all reptilian features ; maternal care for the young and the presence of milk glands and lactation are mammalian . ( 5 ) Facial Muscles In monotremes , as in other mammals , the neck muscles supplied by the facial nerve ( VII ) have spread over the surface of the face , but the course of the evolution by which they have done so is not t he same in monotremes and higher mammals . This is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shoulder girdle ( p. 396 ) ? in which monotremes and other mammals differ in the direction rather than the extent of their evolution . The spread of these muscles on to the face is one of the characters that most clearly differentiates the mammals from all lower vertebrates ( 31,76 ) . There is no sign of ' the spread in the reptiles or birds , though in the latter the bones of the skull are , as in mammals , covered by soft tissues . The facial muscles are used by mammals for the expression of their feelings and . emotions ( pp. 479ff. ) , and the ability to do this has probably been very valuable to them in their successful evolution . In reptiles these muscles lie in the neck ( Fig. 247 , A , B ) . They consist of an outer layer ( sphincter colli ) ( p. 283 ) which forms a broad sheath round the neck , and an inner layer ( depressor mandibuli ) which is attached to the mandible and opens the mouth . Both are derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supplied by the seventh cranial nerve , the facial . In all mammals both these muscles have grown forwards on to the face . In monotremes ( D ) the ventral part of the face is covered by an extension of the sphincter colli , now known as the sphincter colli externus . The dorsal part is covered by the platysma , an extension of // the depressor mandibuli , which also lies partly within the sphincter colli externus . In addition , the platysma extends into the pectoral limb and to the base of the beak in Ornithorhynchus . In other mammals ( C ) the platysma extends on to the face but is smaller than in the monotremes and does not extend into the limb . Most of the facial muscles are formed from an extension of the sphincter colli distinct from the sphincter colli externus . This extension becomes divided into numerous muscles which cause the various movements of the parts of the face . It differs from the extension of the sphincter colli in monotremes in lying within and not outside the platysma . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monotremes is represented in other mammals by only a few fibres on the neck close behind the skull . Thus , the facial muscles of the monotremes differ from those of other mammals in their origin from different extensions of the sphincter colli , in the larger part of them formed from the platysma , and in not being divided into a large number of separate muscles on the face . The monotremes share with other mammals the spread of the facial muscles on to the face , but the spread of these muscles follows in them a course different from that in other mammals . ( 6 ) Conclusion From this account it is clear that the monotremes possess a very complex mixture of reptilian and mammalian characters both in their structure and their physiology . The mammalian features may // be either whole organs ? or systems of organs ? or small details of structure in organs otherwise reptilian . Equally , whole organs or small details may be reptilian . Two different interpretations of these facts are possible , if we accept the view of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divergent mammalian line that evolved from the synapsids very early in mammalian history . Either their mammalian characters must have been present in the stock from which they diverged , and the early mammals , and perhaps even the synapsids from which they evolved , must have possessed hair , a diaphragm , a completely divided heart and the many other characters in which monotremes and other mammals agree . Or these characters were evolved in monotremes and other modern mammals by parallel evolution . The evidence we have found for widespread and complex parallel evolution in groups of the lower vertebrates ( pp. 383 etc. ) makes this second interpretation not so unlikely as it would otherwise seem . We shall discuss these matters again in the concluding chapter ( pp. 490ff . ) . CHAPTER XVIII THE MAMMALIAN REORGANISATION : STRUCTURE 1 . THE GROUPS OF MAMMALS ( 147,209 ) All mammals except monotremes ( Prototheria ) are classified in the sub-class Theria , the subdivisions of which include , besides the groups of the living mammals , the mesozoic groups discussed in Chapter XVI . Livingm ammals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Metatheria or Marsupialia and the Eutheria or placental mammals . These two divisions were already separate in the Cretaceous ( p. 389 ) , when the marsupials were represented by early opossums , and the placentals by insectivores . It is believed that the two groups were independently evolved from the pantotheres , though if this is true the common characters in which they differ from pantotheres show that there must have been much parallel evolution in their descent . All the Cretaceous mammals , marsupials and placentals as well as those of other groups , were small ( p. 385 ) , and so avoided the competition of the large reptiles . They were mostly carnivorous , feeding on small prey such as insects and other invertebrates . Marsupials and placentals differ in numerous characters , but their most striking difference is the presence of an allantoic placenta and a long uterine development in all placentals and the absence of these in marsupials , except that the placenta is present in a rudimentary , but functional , form in a few species ( p. 459 ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in placentals and develop in the pouch or marsupium . Both marsupials and placentals radiated into many adaptive branches in the Tertiary , and became the dominant land vertebrates of the world . Both were present in all continents except Australia* in the earlier Tertiary , and the placentals have retained their dominance to the present time wherever they have been present . The marsupial opossums are still present in North America and were present both in Europe and N. America for most of the Tertiary , // but otherwise marsupials have been absent since the early Tertiary from all continents except South America and Australia . In South America a marsupial fauna evolved in the Tertiary and persisted to the Pliocene when it was killed out ? except for the opossums and one other recent form ( Caenolestes ) ? as a result of immigration from North America of placentals of groups other than those already present in S. America . In Australia , the marsupials were isolated from placentals ? except for a few rodents ? from the Eocene onwards and there radiated into the large Australian marsupial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many radiating lines , most of them parallel to the subdivisions of the placentals in other parts of the world . We shall not be concerned to trace the radiation of either group of the Theria . Rather , we shall discuss the general features of the reorganisation by which the mammals of both groups were evolved from their synapsid predecessors and were able to extend their dominance over the environments of the world . 2 . SKELETON ( 15,150 ) ( 1 ) The Skull and jaws In the skull , as in all other parts of their structure , mammals show clearly their origin from the later synapsids , and still more certainly from the pantotheres , in the features in which the structure of that group is known . Typical synapsid features of the mammalian skull are : the great widening of the synapsid vacuity and the loss of the postorbital arcade so that the vacuity is confluent with the orbit- - except in some mammals such as ourselves and the horse in which a new , secondary , postorbital arcade is formed ; preservation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zygomatic arch ; and presence of a fully developed false palate . In all the mammals the post-dentary bones of the lower jaw have been not only reduced , as in synapsids , but some of them have passed into the ear , and the articulation of the jaw is between the squamosal and the dentary . All mammals resemble the pantotheres in the structure of their molar teeth and in some features of the form of the lower jaw . ( a ) Cartilage Bones . In the mammalian skull the following features of the cartilage bones may be noted : The occipital condyles are double , formed by the exoccipitals , the basioccipital having passed into the floor of the braincase . In the floor in front of the basioccipital ( Fig. 249 ) is a basisphenoid in the centre of which is a depression ( sella turcica ) in which the hypophysis // lies , and in front of this another bone , the presphenoid , on a level with the orbits . Lastly in this series , the mesethmoid , separate from the presphenoid in many mammals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ li ) ruas the cribriform plate through which the olfactory nerves pass to the nose . The mesethmoid also forms a median septum which projects forwards between the nasal capsules . In the side wall of the braincase above the presphenoid are paired cartilage bones , the orbitosphenoids . How these three bones ? presphenoid , mesethmoid and orbito- sphenoid ? are related to the bones in similar positions in the lower vertebrates has been disputed . The orbitosphenoids often , but nett always , arise from the same ossification as the presphenoid , and may be lateral wings of that hone in origin . Together the t litre bones may represent the pleurosphenoid often wrongly called alisphenoid told ? of fishes , and the whole complex may be represented by the sphenethmoid of the frog . Or , again , the mesethmoid may be a new formation . In mammals the bones of the otic capsule surrounding the inner ear are fused to form a single bone , the periotic , and this in some mammals such as man fuses with part of the ( dermal ) squamosal to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends laterally behind the capsule towards the ear and the articulation of the jaw , to form the paroccipital process . In the more primitive placentals the middle ear is incompletely protected . The tympanic ( see below ) is present in them but forms only a ring round the tympanum . In the more advanced placentals there is present a more or less spherical sheath of bone , the tympanic bulla , surrounding the middle ear . This is formed by an outgrowth // either of the periotic ( entotympanic ) or of the tympanic or from both of these . In some mammals ( e.g. primates ) the tympanic also forms a cylindrical surround for the outer ear . In many marsupials there is a bulla around the middle ear but it is formed by an extension of the alisphenoid . In the nasal cavity extensions of the mesethmoid from the posterior turbinals . These are covered by epithelium of which a part contains the olfactory sense cells and the rest has the functions of filtering , moistening and warming the air as it passes through the cavity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar extensions of the maxillae and nasals ; their epithelium is not olfactory . It has the same function as the non-olfactory parts of the posterior turbinals. ( b ) Dermal bones . It has been mentioned earlier ( p. 395 ) that in mammals the cavum epiptericum , which is immediately behind the orbit and outside the braincase in lower forms , has been taken into the braincase , which thus becomes expanded . With this change has gone inclusion of the alisphenoid , which , as the epipterygoid , stood free in reptiles , into the wall of the braincase where it covers a large part of the side . The bones of the dermal roof are still more reduced in number than in the synapsids ( Fig. 248 ) . Nasals , frontals and parietals cover the skull dorsally , and a small median interparietal is present in many mammals between the parietals and the supra-occipital ; it probably represents the fused postparietals of reptiles . On the side wall in front of the orbits a lacrimal is present and bears the foramen of the lacrimal duct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in no other mammals . The squamosal is large and with extensions of the parietals covers most of the otic region . It also extends on to the zygomatic arch . Pre- and postfrontals , postorbitals , supratemporals , intertemporals , tabulars and quadratojugals are all absent from the mammalian skull . The quadrate has passed into the ear as the incus ( see below ) . On the ventral side of the skull ( Fig. 250 A ) the false ( hard ) palate ( p. 374 ) is carried back to the level of the anterior end of the zygomatic arch ; it is formed by extensions of the maxillae and palatines . The mammalian pterygoids are said to represent lateral wings of the parasphenoid of reptiles , and are not the same bone as the ' Echidna pterygoid ' ( p. 395 ) which is believed to be the ectopterygoic l of reptiles . The mammalian pterygoids are relatively small and are firmly joined to the palatine and basisphenoid . In the original roof of the mouth above the false palate and near the posterior nares is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent the fused vomers of reptiles ( p. 395 ) , though this has been disputed . The zygomatic arch is in most mammals strong and in many mammals bowed outwards to give space for the large jaw muscles . The arch is broken or absent in many edentates and some insectivores. ( c ) The Lower jaws and the Ossicles of the Ear . The lower jaw of the mammals ( Fig. 250 B ) is formed by a single bone , the dentary , which can be seen in the embryo to surround on all sides the original cartilage of the jaw , Meckel 's cartilage . Of the other bones present in the reptilian jaw , which we saw were reduced in the synapsids , the splenials and coronoids have disappeared without trace , and the articular and angular have passed into the middle ear , the articular forming the malleus and the angular the tympanic ( see below ) . The supra-angular and pre-articular may also have been entirely lost , or may be represented by small knobs of bone in the ear near the malleus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulation of the jaw is between the dentary and the // squamosal , having presumably passed from the original articularquadrate articulation through a stage in which all four bones took part in a single articulation . We have seen ( p. 383 ) that a complex articulation of this type was probably present in some of the highest synapsids . In most mammals the dentary bears dorsally in front of the articulation a large coronoid ' process ? a part of the dentary and therefore not homologous with the reptilian coronoid bone ? and ventrally at its posterior end an angular process , again not the reptilian bone . On these processes and on neighbouring parts of the dentary the muscles moving the jaw are attached ( p. 435 ) . Processes similar to both these are present in pantotheres . In the mammalian ear the tympanum is not on the surface of the head but sunk to the base of an ectodermal invagination , the external ear , around the opening of which a flap of skin , the pinna , serves to collect the sound . In the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other and with the tympanum and the fenestra ovalis ( Fig. 251 A ) . Of these the innermost , the stirrup-shaped stapes , homologous with the reptilian bone of the same name ( p. 250 ) , covers the fenestra . It is pierced by an opening through which the stapedial artery , a branch of the internal carotid , passes when it is present ( p. 427 ) . Next in the chain is the incus , a more or less rod-shaped ossicle in contact with the stapes and with the third omit* , the malleus . The malleus has a long process , the manubrium , fixed to the tympanum . Both . malleus and incus are attached to the wall of the middle ear by ligaments . A small stapedial muscle is attached t the stapes and to the paroccipital region oft lie skull , and allot her , the tensor tympani , to the malleus . ( Fig. 251 A ) . These mucscles hold the ossicles in position and control the tension in the tympanum . The chain of ossicles improves the functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations at the fenestra as compared with the tympanum , and by protecting the tympanum from rupture by over-large noises . The origin of the bones in the middle ear from the quadrate ( incus ) and the post-dentary bones of the lower jaw ( articular , malleus ; angular , tympanic ) can be seen in the embryology of mammals ( Fig. 251 B ) . Thus , in the history of the vertebrate ear elements of structure which have on two occasions lost their original function found new and quite different uses . First , the most dorsal bone of the hyoid arch became the stapes or columella ( p. 250 ) , and secondly , much later , the quadrate , articular and angular were absorbed into the ear . On both occasions most of the connections of these bones with parts of the skeleton around them were preserved ; the a t // stapes retained its contact with the skull , quadrate , etc. ( p. 249 ) , and the quadrate with the articular. ( 2 ) Teeth ( 63,150 ) The teeth of mammals differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the differences are foreshadowed in the synapsids. ( a ) Mammalian teeth are never formed on the palate as in many reptiles . They are restricted to single lines along upper and lower jaws . ( b ) In mammals the teeth are differentiated , as they already were in synapsids , into incisors , canines , premolars and molars in adaptation to the different functions they serve . In mesozoic mammals the number of teeth in each group was variable , but already in early placentals the number had become fixed to 3 incisors , 1 canine , 4 premolars and 3 molars . In specialised mammals the number of teeth in each group may be greatly altered , and in some mammals ( edentates ) teeth may be absent . ( c ) In unspecialised mammals the molars and premolars are rooted ( p. 382 ) , though they lose their roots in many mammals , especially in those in which they are used for grinding vegetable food . The teeth then grow continuously , replacing the grinding surface as it is worn away . Incisors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 378 ) that there is evidence of evolution towards rootedness in the teeth of the higher synapsids. ( d ) The primitive mammalian pattern of the crown of the molar teeth was the tritubercular pattern of the pantotheres ( p. 388 ) , and the teeth functioned in biting as in them . But in many mammals , especially the herbivorous groups , the crowns of both upper and lower molars became square instead of triangular . In the upper molars the square form is produced ( Fig. 252 ) by development of a new cusp , the lypocone , alongside and posterior to the protocone , so that the crown now had four major cusps instead of three . In the lower molars the square form was reached by the loss of one of the cusps of the trigonid , the paraconid , the crown now having two cusps on the trigonid and two on the talonid . Smaller cusps were also added in both upper and lower teeth . In the radiation of the mammals the forms of the crowns become modified in various ways . ( e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except horny teeth ' such as those of modern amphibians ? are formed from both the ectoderm of the jaw and the mesoderm within it , the ectoderm forming the covering of enamel and the mesoderm the dentine and the pulp in the interior of the tooth ( cf. p. 887 ) . In most reptiles the ectoderm sinks as a pit where the tooth is to develop and the tooth is formed at the bottom of . this pit . In mammals and some reptiles there is not a separate pit for each tooth but an ectodermal groove , the dental lamina , formed along the line of teeth on each jaw . Where a tooth is to form at the base of this lamina ( Fig. 253 ) , a cup lined with ectoderm develops and a mesodermal projection covered by ectoderm grows ont into the centre of ' the clip . Drum the mesoderm within this projection a covering of dentine is formed . // Its central part remains uncalcified as the pulp ; enamel forms from the inner surface of the ectoderm covering the projection . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamina to the surface . In mammals and some reptiles the bases of the developing teeth become surrounded by the bone of the jaw , so that the teeth become implanted in sockets in the bone ( thecodont ) ; in other reptiles they are either attached to the side of the jaw bone ( pleurodont ) or to its upper edge ( acrodont ) . The teeth are bound to the jaw bones by another calcareous substance , softer than bone or dentine , cement . In mammals the roots of the teeth lie in separate sockets . ( f ) In the vertebrates below the mammals the teeth are resorbed after they have functioned for some time and are replaced by new teeth which are formed in much the same way as the earlier . In mammals , an area of ectoderm in the lamina outlines the form of the new tooth ( Fig. 253 ) and , together with the mesoderm within it , develops in the manner already described into a new tooth , which grows into the position of the old , pushing the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth may be replaced several times during the life-history . This is so in most reptiles , but in some ? and in some amphibians ? there is the complication that the line of teeth along each jaw is replaced alternately , numbers 1 , 4 , etc. , from the front being replaced while numbers 2 , 3 , etc. , are functioning efficiently ( Fig. 254 ) . In mammals only a single , incomplete , replacement takes place . A first dentition , the milk or lacteal dentition , is formed ( luring development , the teeth erupting from before backwards . Before the molars of this dentition have erupted , the most anterior teeth , the incisors , are replaced by the teeth of the permanent dentition . But the replacement does not extend to the molars . The molars of the milk dentition are functional throughout life . // ( 3 ) Vertebral Column As in the later synapsids , the vertebrae of mammals have centra formed by the pleurocentra ( p. 202 ) , the hypocentra having been lost . But the form of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat ( amphiplatyan ) in contrast with the conical ends of reptilian vertebrae , and the front and back ends of each vertebra are modified into disc-shaped plates of bone ( epiphyses ) . Between each pair of vertebrae is cartilage , the intervertebral disc , which may represent the hypocentrum . In the centre of this cartilage is a remnant of the notochord of the embryo , the nucleus pulposus . The capitulum of the rib articulates between the centra , on the front and back edges of neighbouring centra . In mammals the column has become more differentiated along its length than in lower vertebrates in adaptation to the different functions that the parts serve . The neck has always seven vertebrae , except in sloths which have six or nine . It is flexible to allow free movement of the head , and perhaps for this reason the ribs on the vertebrae of the neck are reduced to fixed processes . The atlas and axis are fully differentiated ( Fig. 231 , p. 379 ) , the atlas being fin-tiled from the neural arch and hypocentrum of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first vertebra ( odontoic peg ) and the neural arch , hypo- and pleurocentra of the second ; there is no pro-atlas . The thoracic vertebrae bear the movable ribs , all of which except some of the most posterior encircle the body and are attached to the sternum , or more accurately to the parts into which it is divided , the sternebrae ( see below ) . It is characterstic of mammals in contrast with reptiles ? except some synapsids that there should be a variable number of vertebrae without movable ribs between the thorax and the sacrum . The whole body region of the column is in the form of a strong arch , somewhat flexible in the vertical plane to allow the bending caused by locomotion in the mammalian manner ( p. 461 ) , yet strong enough to bear the weight of the body . One to three sacral vertebrae are attached to the pelvic girdle , but a number of neighbouring vertebrae may be fused with these to form a single bony mass , the sacrum . The tail is reduced in mammals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body in front of it . It serves many different functions in the various mammals . All these features are true of the column in the typical mammal . Where the habits are very different from the running or climbing habits of most mammals the column is often altered in its adaptations . Thus in whales and porpoises the body is fish-like in form , the neck loses its power of bending , the limbs are reduced or lost ,
