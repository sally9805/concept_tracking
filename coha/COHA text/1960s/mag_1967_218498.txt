Throughout the South , the quiet campuses of Negro colleges are smoldering with the unrest and resentments of an unquiet generation . One night last week , Houston 's Texas Southern University , which is 95% Negro , erupted into a campus-style Watts . By morning , 488 students were arrested , one student and two policemen were wounded and a rookie cop was dead . <P> About 50 students were gathered in front of the student union when a rumor went through the crowd that a policeman had shot a six-year-old Negro child that day . Someone heaved a watermelon at a police cruiser , and the crowd dispersed to shout the shooting rumor through the campus . It was too late to tell them that the six-year-old was actually a white child wounded by a white boy who was target-shooting . <P> Students poured out of their dormitories . More police arrived . Rocks and bottles flew . Then shots flashed from Lanier Hall , a men 's dormitory , wounding Officer R. D. Blaylock in the thigh . <P> Soon it was full combat between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormed the dormitory , pouring more than 3,000 rounds of shotgun and carbine fire into the building . Officer Dale Dugger , 32 , took a bullet wound in the cheek . Patrolman Louis Kuba , 25 , was hit in the forehead and died six hours later . " It looked like the Alamo , " said one policeman . Somehow , only one student was wounded . After the cops had raged through the dormitory , virtually all of its 144 rooms were wrecked-TV sets kicked in , clothes destroyed and even the housemother 's sewing machine smashed . <P> In the morning all but four of the 488 arrested students were released , but the mood at T.S.U. remained venomous . What caused the riot ? " Hate , " was the explanation of S.N.C.C. leader F. D. Kirkpatrick . Hatred of the school administration , police , Whitey , and every other target of a student 's ire on the eve of final exams , which were held on schedule .                 @ @ @ @
