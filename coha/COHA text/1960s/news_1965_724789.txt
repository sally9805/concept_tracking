txt New York Organized labor is disappointed with President Johnson 's proposals for changing major federal labor laws , but it is firmly committed to support the program placed before Congress Tuesday . The AFL-CIO 's executive board , meeting in Washington Wednesday , endorsed presidential recommendations and called for their quick enactment . George Meany , AFL-CIO presidents said unions are " generally happy " with the proposals , although they hope to get more when bills come up on Capitol Hill . Many council members and other union leaders are privately less enthusiastic . They had hoped for a stronger presidential statement , with much more in it . Message delayed One federation vice-president commented bluntly : " The President cut us down . Now let 's see how hard he 'll push Congress to pass what he recommended . I 'm reserving my judgment until I find that out . " As it is , the presidential message includes a package of labor legislation that could mean a long , hot summer on Capitol Hill . Although short of what labor wanted , the proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost all are controversial . To the unions , the most important proposal was covered in fewer than 10 lines of a 210-line message , and in a much more subdued manner than labor had urged . This was the recommendation for repeal of Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Law which allows states to enforce " right-to-work " laws barring union-shop contracts . Labor wants the section eliminated to wipe out restrictive laws in 19 states . The few lines dealing with Taft-Hartley changes may be the only ones Congress will take up before its summer recess . Because the .. President 's labor message was several times delayed , recommendations of changes in wage-hour and unemployment compensation laws may not be acted on until the end of the year , perhaps not until early 1966 . In addition to the proposal for repeal of Section 14(b) : ? The President asked Congress to extend minimum wage coverage to 4,500,000 more workers  --  twice the number he cited in earlier discussions of wage-hour act changes . Overtime pay The larger number to be covered was a major concession to unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal minimum of $1.25 an hour . Labor had pressed hard for White House support of at least $1.50 . ? The President also asked for wage-hour act revisions to require double pay for " excessive " overtime hours  --  initially , for more than 48 hours . But the starting point would be lowered over the next three years , to 45 hours in 1968 . Unions contend double pay , would mean more jobs . ? And the President called for sweeping changes in federal-state unemployment programs  --  the first major improvements in three decades . One change would give long-term unemployed up to 26 weeks of extra benefits , from federal funds , after state compensation runs out . Another would require states to meet federal standards ( a long-time labor objective ) including a minimum benefit equal to 50 percent of weekly pay . This would boost rates in 39 states . Other proposals would tighten disqualification rules to cut down benefits frauds , and add 5 million workers to unemployment compensation protection ? including some farm and agricultural pocessing workers , employees of nonprofit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more persons , a reduction from the minimum four now . The President said that he was leaving the door open for later action on higher minimum wages . As average wages go up , he said , the minimum should go up , too . But he said Congress should decide when and how much the increase should be . Proposals due This was deft footwork . The pressures labor has been exerting on the White House now will be redirected to Congress . Similarly , the President said he would not recommend cutting the work-week ( " I do not think the time for change has come , " he said ) . But he added that he was asking the National Commission on Technology , Automation and Economic Progress to put " the matter of work periods " on its agenda . Unions want the work week cut to expand job opportunities . A major congressional fight is already shaping up on the 14(b) issue . A House subcommittee will consider other presidential labor law proposals beginning next week , with fights also in prospect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected wage-hour changes , and revisions in unemployment compensation systems will be strongly opposed by " states ' rights " congressmen.
