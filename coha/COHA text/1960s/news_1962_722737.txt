txt BY THOMAS FITZPATRICK Several hundred residents of the 4800 block of Greenwood avenue got a good look at a golden eagle yesterday . The eagle got a good look at them , too . The way things turned out it pleased neither the ' residents nor the eagle . Here 's how it all began : " MY son James , he 's 11 , was the first to spot the eagle , " said Dr. J. H. Barnes , 4820 Greenwood ay . " James was walking down our front drive on his way to school at about 8 o'clock when he saw the eagle sitting on our roof . " Police Are Called " I came rushing out to see what kind of a bird it was . Sure enough , it looked like an eagle . He was sitting there lo proudly and imperiously that he looked like he owned the house . I did n't know what to do so I called the police . " Quickly Dr. Barnes was joined in his vigil by two patrolmen from the Hyde Park district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnes ' house to get a look , too . The vigil lasted until noon . By this time there were six squad cars , a street jammed with residents , and a two-roan crew from the Anti-Cruelty society on hand . Cop Tells Story Patrolman James Thomas tells what happened next : " I was standing guard making sure that no small children would get too close to the eagle . The bird had been sitting there just staring back at all *of us . Two men from the Anti-Cruelty society started climbing up to the roof with a big net hoping to throw it over the eagle . " He waited until they were on top of the roof and ready to make their move before he moved . Then , quick as a wink , he was up in the air and flew across the street and landed in the branch of a tree . Lands on Dog " But just then a man came walking along with a very tiny dog . ( This was Fred Goodman , 4727 Ingleside ay. , and " Penny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped into the street than the eagle was on them . " The man thought the eagle was going for him and he dodged . But the eagle landed on the lit.tle dog . Then we all did everything we could to save the dog 's life . " Thomas rushed forward and fired a shot at the eagle . It missed . Goodman picked up a broom lying on the sidewalk and plunged into the fray between eagle and dog . The eagle fled back to the roof of the house . The puppy 's leg was broken in the fight . A call was placed to the Lincoln Park zoo . Ray Pawley , a zoologist , rushed to the scene . One shot from his tranquilizer gun brought the eagle down . It then was taken to the zoo , where it is hoped it eventually can be added to the collection of golden eagles . The golden eagle is indigenous to Illinois , but the birds generally fly high and rarely land on a city street . " I guess this one was just hungry and ornery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Side Street ( TRIBUNE Photo By Jack MuIcohY1 Fred Goodman , owner of trapped dog , attacking golden eagle with broom .
