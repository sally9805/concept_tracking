Not since Bonnieville , Ky. , shaped up in 1963 had the American Automobile Association pinned its " speed trap " label on a single U.S. town . So last June , tourist-conscious Floridians were understandably irked when the A.A.A. informed its 10 million members that the tiny town of Coleman ( pop . 921 ) , north of Tampa , had suddenly become the nation 's biggest speed trap-in fact the only one . <P> The A.A.A. had the goods on Coleman 's one-man police force . Chief Ernest H. Barry , 64 , had taken to lurking behind a billboard and pouncing on every unwitting out-of-towner who exceeded 15 m.p.h . In five months , Barry arrested 369 motorists , none of them Coleman citizens . Only half of each $15 take wound up in the town treasury ; the other $7.50 was split among Mayor J. F. Crawford as the town judge ( $2 ) , the town clerk ( 500 ) and Chief Barry ( $5 ) . <P> Florida 's Governor Haydon Burns wrote a prodding letter to Mayor Crawford , arguing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . " After all , explained Burns with pragmatic hospitality , tourists swell Florida 's economy by $4 billion a year and chip in 17% of its total tax take . The mayor has just fired the police chief . <P> The A.A.A. expects few more U.S. speed traps ; the growing interstate highway system is bypassing those little towns that love to nab strangers . But the American Bar Association warns of another kind of traffic trap- " fee courts , " which pay local magistrates out of fines they assess , and thus encourage them to nail every available errant . Although the Supreme Court has condemned it , the fee system still thrives wherever local governments are too poor to pay judges a regular salary . That includes traffic courts in hundreds of counties in 25 states .
