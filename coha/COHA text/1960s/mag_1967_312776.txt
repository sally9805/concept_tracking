Despite the steady increase of Negro students at the nation 's major universities , the U.S. still has more than 120 colleges that have a predominantly Negro student population . How good are they ? In the current issue of the Harvard Educational Review , Sociologist David Riesman and Christopher Jencks , a contributing editor of the New Republic , deliver a soberly scathing judgment . The Negro colleges , they argue , constitute an " academic disaster area . " <P> Riesman and Jencks contend that the Negro colleges never had a satisfactory rationale for their separatism , existing only because white colleges would not admit black students . Dependent largely upon whites for financial survival , the schools have never been aggressive in attacking segregation . For officials of these colleges , " the result was usually self-contempt , born either from acceptance of the white view that Negroes were inferior or from disgust at having succumbed silently to an outrageous injustice , or from both . " Their schools became " an ill-financed , ill-staffed caricature of white higher education . " <P> Frustration &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are staffed by a " domineering but frightened president " and a " faculty tyrannized by the president and in turn tyrannizing the students . " They " admit almost any high school graduate who will pay tuition and graduate most of those who keep paying . " But about half the students simply opt out-and not without reason : " These colleges are so monotonous that it may well be the better students who leave , in frustration or boredom . " <P> The researchers consider it " unlikely that any all-Negro school will ever have a first-rate graduate professional program . " The only Negro medical schools-those at Howard University in Washington and Meharry in Nashville- " rank among the worst in the nation , and would probably have been closed long ago had they not been a main source of doctors willing to tend Negro patients . " The five Negro law schools , claim Riesman and Jencks , " are only one jump ahead of the accrediting agencies . " <P> On the undergraduate level , the authors rate only a handful of Negro schools as exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morehouse , Spelman , Hampton , Howard , Tuskegee , Dillard , Texas Southern and Morgan State " near the middle of the national academic procession . " A few of these schools , they point out , are good enough to attract white students and eventually they may lose their identity as basically Negro schools . <P> Neurotic Reasons . Riesman and Jencks doubt that the majority of Negro colleges will ever achieve significant student integration . The only whites many can attract are those who attend them " for a mixture of idealistic , exploratory and neurotic reasons . " At the same time , white colleges increasingly seek out the best Negro students , contributing further to the decline of the Negro schools . Yet these institutions will not die , say the authors , if only because they " give an otherwise unattainable sense of importance to their trustees , administrators , faculty and alumni .
