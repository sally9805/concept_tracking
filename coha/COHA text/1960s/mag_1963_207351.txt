One of America 's favorite swashbuckling 19th century adventurers last week became the subject of dispute between two U.S. Presidents who fancy their status as amateur historians . <P> <P> In Costa Rica last month , President Kennedy declared : " We can never be secure in our hemisphere until the Soviet Union goes the way of George III , the Spanish conquerors , Maximilian and William Walker . " <P> <P> William Walker ? Fightin ' words , sputtered ex-President Harry Truman . Walker , said Truman , " was a kind of revolutionary intellectual during the 1850 's , when there was a great deal of ferment throughout the hemisphere . " His purpose was to unite the Central American nations in a pattern similar to the U.S. And that , in Truman 's view , hardly qualified him as an evil figure . <P> Which President had it right ? <P> On to Mexico . William Walker , born in Nashville in 1824 , looked like Charles Atlas ' original 97-lb. weakling , short and extremely shy . But his inner drives were formidable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west to San Francisco , where he heard about the empty lands to the south in Mexico . In 1853 he decided that he was the man to " colonize " Mexico 's Baja California and Sonora with U.S. homesteaders . He organized an " army " of 45 like-minded adventurers and sailed down the Pacific coast to La Paz . Without firing a shot , he took the town , declaring Baja California an independent republic . <P> It took the Mexicans six months to run him out of the country and back to the U.S. , where he was tried for violating U.S. neutrality laws and acquitted by a sympathetic jury . Next , with 58 men , he invaded strife-torn Nicaragua , captured Granada , a key city , and in effect took over the government , naming himself Secretary of War and boss of the army . In 1856 he had himself inaugurated President of Nicaragua , and wangled recognition from U.S. President Franklin Pierce . <P> War with Vanderbilt . He had heroic dreams of welding Central America 's five tiny republics into a powerful economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afoul of powerful U.S. interests in Central America . He confiscated some of the boats and property belonging to the Accessory Transit Co. , controlled by Shipping and Railroad Tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt . Reacting in kind , Vanderbilt sent agents to stir up Nicaragua 's neighbors against Walker , and soon a war was on : Nicaragua against Costa Rica , Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador . After a series of desperate battles , the U.S. Navy took a hand to prevent further bloodshed , and hauled Walker home . Six months later , he slipped back to Nicaragua-and this time the Navy had to arrest him to get him home . But again he got a reprieve . President James Buchanan regarded his arrest as illegal .
