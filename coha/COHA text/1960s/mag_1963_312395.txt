CIVIL RIGHTS <P> ( See Cover ) <P> If there is no struggle , there is no progress . Those who profess to favor freedom , and yet deprecate agitation , are men who want crops without plowing up the ground . They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters . <P> - Abolitionist Negro Frederick Douglass , 1857 <P> In 1963 , that awful roar is heard as never before . <P> " My basic strength is those 300,000 lower-class guys who are ready to mob , rob , steal and kill , " boasts Cecil Moore , 48 , head of the Philadelphia branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . <P> Says Mel Ladson , 26 , a Miami leader in the Congress of Racial Equality : " I want to be able to go in that restaurant and eat , and it does n't mean a damn to me if , the owner 's guts are boiling with resentment . I want to nonviolently beat the hell out of him . " <P> Predicts Dr. Gardner Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church : " The streets are going to run red with blood . " <P> Cries the Rev. James Bevel , a Mississippi official of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference : " Some punk who calls himself the President has the audacity to tell people to go slow . I 'm not prepared to be humiliated by white trash the rest of my life , including Mr. Kennedy . " <P> These are voices-some voices-of the Negro revolution . That revolution , dramatically symbolized in this week 's massed march in Washington , has burst out of the South to engulf the North . It has made it impossible for almost any Negro to stay aloof , except at the cost of ostracism by other Negroes as an " Uncle Tom . " It has seared the white conscience-even while , in some of its excesses , it has created white bitterness where little or none existed before . And right up to the President of the U.S. , it has forced white politicians who have long cashed in on their lip service to " civil rights " to put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every revolution , the Negro revolution is formless . It is , as ex-Slave Douglass said it must be , an oceanic tide of many waters . The voices of hatred are in the minority-so far . But they often drown out softer , equally determined and far more effective Negro voices . <P> Obviously , no Negro can speak for all . No organization can represent all Negro aspirations . But in the late summer of 1963 , as the revolution intensifies , if there is one Negro who can lay claim to the position of spokesman and worker for a Negro consensus , it is a slender , stoop-shouldered , sickly , dedicated , rebellious man named Roy Wilkins . <P> Wilkins , 62 , is executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , the oldest ( founded in 1909 ) , biggest ( 400,000 members , and growing at the rate of 5% a year ) , and most potent of U.S. civil rights organizations . Wilkins himself is a professional in the business of protest . As a reporter and managing editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for eight years , and as a fulltime N.A.A.C.P. worker for 32 , he was a racial rebel in the days when the white man 's answer was not just a paddy wagon but , all too often , a lynch mob 's rope . <P> Among many young , highly militant Negroes , it has become fashionable to denounce the N.A.A.C.P. as oldfashioned . Wilkins is keenly aware of the
