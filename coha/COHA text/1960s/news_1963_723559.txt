txt Premier Khrushchev called tonight for an end to polemics in the ideological dispute between the Soviet Union and Communist China . He proposed that both sides in the dispute let time determine which point of view was " correct . " " It seems to us that this would not require a very long period , " Mr. Khrushchev said . His appeal was contained an interview published here tonight in Izvestia , the Government newspaper . The inter icw was given Friday to a group of 50 left-wing journalists attending a seminar in the Soviet Union . ' The Wisest Thing ' Proposing an end to the debate . between the two parties , Mr. Khrushchev said : " We consider that the wisest thing for the Socialist countries , Communist and working parties , would be to stop the polemics between the Communist parties in the interests of strengthening the unity of all Socialist countries . " Mr. Khrushchev said that the Soviet leadership based its position on the declarations adopted by the Communist parties of the world in 1957 and 1960 . The Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the decisions of the two conferences . " If this is so , " he said , " would it not be better to stop making statements against each other ? " Says Split Aids Foes The present differences in the Communist movement , the Premier said , aid " the enemies of Communism and the enemies of peace . " " Why give pleasure to these people and pain to the friends of peace and Socialism ? " Mr. Khrushchev added . The Chinese and Soviet leaders both have made repeated calls for an end to public attacks . Similar calls have also been made by a number of Communist/parties not directly involved in the conflict . Today 's appeal by Mr. Khrushchev and the relatively moderate tone in which it was made took on significance because of the meeting of some 25 Communist delegations that is expected to be held here early next month . The meeting may lay the groundwork for a new world conference of Communist parties to be held next year . The conference would presumably be called to deal with the ideological conflict and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Premier mentioned in his interview . The world conference would presumably be a last attempt to end the differences between the Soviet Union and Communist China , or it could lead to an open break between the majority of the Communist parties , backing the Soviet linion , and the Chinese-led minority group . It is generally believed that an attempt to reconcile the differences could not be made unless the present bitter polemics were stopped first . In the interview , the Premier also attacked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for planning a multinational nuclear fleet . This plan would present " a still greater danger of an outbreak of thermonuclear war , " Mr. Khrushchev said . The multinational force , he said , would mean that the West Germans ? " the most frantically revanchist and aggressive force " in Europe  --  would gain access to nuclear weapons . The Soviet Union , he said , attaches prime importance to " an early conclusion " of a German peace treaty . Mr. Khrushchev said that this treaty would have to recognize the fact of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate political entity , West Berlin . " Western observers noted that the idea of " three Germanys " had been contained in previous Soviet declarations , but that it had never been set out in such a concise manner before . The Premier also repeated the Soviet proposal for a nonag-1 gression treaty betwen NATO and the Warsaw Pact , the Communist-bloc military grouping . The West is not willing to accept such an agreement unless Soviet officials give guarantees for the security of West Berlin . The Soviet representatives are understood to have , refused strong guarantees in recent talks . In one of two brief references to Cuba in the interview , Mr. Khrushchev charged that the United States had imposed an economic blockade of the island because it " fears the economic progress of the Cuban people under Socialism . " The United States , he said , is afraid that the economic success of the Cuban Communist regime would prove attractive to other Latin-American countries .                    @
