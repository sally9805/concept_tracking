txt Canada 's mounting traffic problems have its highway planners dreaming up all manner of solutions . One of the latest is to turn the important four-lane , north-south Highway 400 into a one-way street at certain hours over the weekends . Highway 400 leads north out of Toronto into increasingly popular northern Ontario regions where vacationers from Canada and the United States are flocking ? and build-. ing massive weekend traffic jams . The plan disclosed by the Ontario Highways Department calls for construction of a three-lane road alongside the present four-lane highway . All four present lanes would become one-way northbound on Fridays and Saturdays , when Toronto residents head for the woods . They would then be reversed to one-way southbound for the return trip on Sundays and Mondays . Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is taking three quiet months to plan the next installment of-his Just Society . When Parliament reassembles on Oct. 22 ? under controversial new rules of procedure  --  it will face a massive agenda and a shortage of money . Most pressing task , Mr. Trudeau says , is to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against galloping inflation . But how ? His only suggestion , so far , is a cut in civil service and public works . Such economies would have to be drastic indeed to offset automatic increases in other government spending and to ensure a budgetary surplus next spring , as the government is hoping . Should public services be trimmed as well ? Or their expansion curbed ? These are the big questions for a government elected last year on a broad policy of social reform . Two basic changes in Canada 's costly welfare state are beginning to emerge . The government now pays monthly allowances to all families with young children , regardless of need . But most households are more prosperous today than ever . So Mr. Trudeau has hinted at the possibility that this popular " baby bonus " might be granted only to those in actual need  --  at fat savings to taxpayers . But so far he has made no decision . A second proposal goes even further . The whole complicated apparatus of federal and provincial welfare payments would be abolished and replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax has found a powerful advocate in Premier W. A. C. Bennett of British Columbia . Unlike President Nixon , who has just turned down such a plan in favor of a work-incentive welfare system , Mr. Bennett contends the negative income tax would attack poverty at its roots and save money now wasted in administration costs . By the time autumn colors maples red and gold , Canadians will get a bundle of tax news . Long study by three successive governments is about to produce the first complete overhaul of the nation 's tax system in modern times . An official white paper outlining a new system is closely guarded . But it is known that Ottawa intends to make taxes more equitable for all income groups . For the prosperous , this should mean higher taxes ; for the poor , a windfall of lower levies . Trends .. . Watch for Canada to reduce its military forces over a period of several years . Despite inflation of all costs , the country is determined to hold its defense budget at a ceiling of $1.8 billion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long Cabinet dispute , no final plans have yet been announced to Canada 's anxious allies . Meanwhile , the government is preparing to close two bases in Ontario and one in Quebec as well as reducing a Quebec air base . How and why .. . British Columbia fishermen believe that huge Russian draggers are bound to deplete fish stocks along the Pacific Coast , just outside Canada 's 12-mile territorial waters . Moreover , it is feared that Russia will establish " historic rights " under international law and will never abandon them in later negotiations . Just this month the Provincial Court in Victoria found the masters of two Russian vessels guilty of fishing within Canada 's territorial limits and fined them $2,500 each . Canadians hope the action will discourage the Soviets . The Ottawa government , already worried about future control of channels between its Arctic islands , is being urged to extend its fishing limits beyond the 12-mile line to the edge of the continental shelf .                 @ @ @ @
