CREW One for the Alumni The first thing most athletes do when they get out of college is to order a heavy meal , wash it down with a cold beer , take a deep drag on a cigarette - and gleefully go to pot . But not if they live in Philadelphia and know how to pull an oar . Philadelphia 's 99-year-old Vesper Boat Club awards no letters or athletic scholarships ; its members work out six days a week , row as much as six miles each practice session . Why ? " Because we like it , " says Secretary-Treasurer John B. Kelly Jr. , onetime Olympic sculler and brother of Monaco 's Princess Grace . " We even like it enough to go out and be good at it . " Very good , even . <P> Last week at New York 's Orchard Beach Lagoon , the smooth-stroking Vesper eight trounced 15 of the country 's finest crews - and thereby became the first club crew to represent the U.S. at the Olympics since another Vesper crew did it in 1904 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks to a mix-up in the mails . Their registration arrived after the deadline : only a last-minute decision by the U.S. Olympic Committee allowed them to compete . Seeded fourth , be hind California , Harvard and Washing ton , Vesper did not figure to offer much competition to the younger col lege crews . Their average age was 26 , and only the presence of two under graduate ringers from La Salle College kept it that low . The part-time coach , Allan Rosenberg , is a Philadelphia law yer . The coxswain , Robert Zimonyi , is a 46-year-old Hungarian refugee . The captain , Bill Knecht , is 34 , a plumbing contractor , the father of six . But in the semifinals , Vesper shocked the experts by beating Harvard , the undefeated Eastern champion , by two lengths and 7.5 sec . <P> That was nothing compared to the surprise Vesper pulled in the finals . California was now the heavy favorite ; the high-stroking Bears had rattled off seven straight victories . At the starting gun , Cal spurted into the lead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale third-and Vesper was left at the line . But then Harvard sliced out in front of Cal , and Vesper began to move up . At the 800-meter mark , with 1,200 meters to go , the Philadelphians drew even with Harvard , edged ahead-and never looked back . Eight tulip-shaped oars swinging as one , they took the stroke up to 40 at the end , swept to a one-length victory in 6 min. 1.3 sec. - fastest time of the entire Olympic trials .
