MAN 'S RISE TO CIVILIZATION AS SHOWN BY THE INDIANS OF NORTH AMERICA FROM PRIMEVAL TIMES TO THE COMING OF THE INDUSTRIAL STATE by Peter Farb. 332 pages . Duffon. $8.95 . <P> <P> Was the North American Indian a noble red man or a bloodthirsty savage ? Both and neither , is the inevitable answer provided in this fascinating though disorganized survey . Commuting between the Aztecs and the Eskimos , millennium-hopping from " primeval times to the coming of the industrial state , " this book is as nomadic as its subject matter . Its author is a **44;2784;TOOLONG who divides his time between duties as consultant to the Smithsonian Institution and curator of American Indian cultures at New York 's Riverside Museum . <P> He holds his many-stranded theme together half by a scientist 's discipline , half by a moralist 's passion . <P> Cruel Colonizinq . Scientist Farb sees the Indian as " a living test tube " -a " nearly ideal " controlled experiment in " the evolution of human customs and beliefs . " Moralist Farb , blowing Scientist Farb 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old art of colonizing . " The white , " Farb writes in barely composed fury , " is an exploiter of human and natural resources ; he has destroyed , often intentionally , almost every alien culture he has come in contact with . " <P> <P> Farb is at his best in disproving the stereotype of the Indian as a pure primitive . He concedes that the Indian 's ancestors , who , he believes , crossed the <P> Bering Strait land bridge 10,000 to 25,000 years ago , comprised genetically " one of the most homogeneous populations on earth . " But the Indian , he says , soon took on " the vastness and the variety of North America " itself . <P> This supposedly simple primitive evolved more than 500 distinct lan - guages , each with its own set of dialects . Great Lakes Indians , practicing what Farb calls " multiple-use conservation , " utilized 275 species of plant for medicine , 130 for food , 27 for smoking . As for ceremonies , even the comparatively backward Shoshone would " make the court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No " Was " Yes . " Outlining the evolving sophistication of Indian society - from family to tribe to chiefdom to state-Farb suggests that the Indian failed to survive not because he was too simple but because he was too complex . Among Northwest Coast Indians , for instance , the social pecking order was so exacting that instead of being arranged in classes , each individual had to have a separate ranking . Potlatch feasts took on nuances of snobbery rivaling a Truman Capote party . Among the Cheyenne , social life became so complicated that for sheer relief a club known as the " Contraries " was formed , whose members said " no " when they meant " yes , " " left " when they meant " right , " and , when summoned , promptly went in the opposite direction .
