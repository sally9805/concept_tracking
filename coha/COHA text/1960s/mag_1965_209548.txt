When astronauts eventually soar be yond the moon to explore the distant planets , they will find Jupiter a dangerous place to visit . Even if they manage to withstand the tremendous pull of Jupiter 's gravity and survive the frigid atmosphere of ammonia , methane , hydrogen and helium , they may well perish in the gigantic storms that sweep the planet every decade or two . <P> Because these violent outbursts never occur at the same point on the planet 's eccentric orbit , some astronomers have suggested that they are caused by the erratic release of internal heat . This would indicate that Jupiter is behaving like a star as well as a planet-radiating not only energy absorbed from the sun but also giving off heat generated in its own interior . Jupiter 's split personality has now been confirmed by a University of Arizona astronomer . <P> More than the Sun . Working with the new 61-in. reflecting telescope at the university 's Catalina Observatory near Tucson , Dr. Frank J. Low focused Jupiter 's image on a germanium bolometer - an infrared measuring device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other now in use . After analyzing the feeble radiation , he determined that Jupiter 's effective temperature is - 225 F.-much warmer than the - 274 F. that Jupiter would register if it were an ordinary planet radiating only the heat it received from the sun . To reach the higher temperature , Low calculated , the heat output of Jupiter would have to be roughly 2-. 5 times as great as the amount of heat it absorbs from the sun . <P> Neither Low nor anyone else can say for certain how Jupiter manufactures its heat . Its internal pressures are not large enough to cause the thermonuclear reactions that occur in a true star . And because less than 1% of Jupiter 's mass consists of the heavier elements that are the source of the radioactive isotopes believed to heat the earth 's core , radioactivity can contribute only a small fraction of the heat that is apparently generated in the interior . <P> A Small Star . To Astronomer Gerard Kuiper , who directs the University of Arizona 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory , there is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " Jupiter is still contracting somewhat under the force of its own gravity . " As the planet contracts , Kuiper speculates , the compressed and solid hydrogen mantle that envelops its molten core occasionally cracks open , releasing the vast amounts of heat that brew Jupiter 's mysterious storms .
