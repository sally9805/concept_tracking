The solution they 're coming up with is a familiar one to taxpayers . Such cities as Chicago , Philadelphia , Cleveland , Pittsburgh and Milwaukee put into effect higher property taxes Jan. 1 to support local schools ; increases ranged up to 12.5% .

Besides the growing number of pupils , other factors are helping accelerate the rise in school costs , including such special budget demands as upgraded educational facilities for Negro students .

These include an increase in the city 's real estate tax of % of a mill per dollar of assessed valuation ( a mill equals one-tenth of one cent ) ; a 1% tax on certain rents , called ground rentals ; and a 2% tax on parimutuel betting at the Liberty Bell harness race track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add about $4,250,000 to school revenues ? in 1964 . Despite the new local taxes and roughly the same amount in increased state aid , Philadelphia 's Board of Education recently found itself with a $10 million budget deficit for 1984 . Its problems trying to overcome the deficit are shared by school boards across the nation . The Philadelphia board asked the city to boost property taxes another 23A , mills , on top of the % of a mill increase already approved , to raise the $10 million .

A problem for Detroit taxpayers , shared by many other major cities , is that the tax base is being whittled away by urban renewal and expressway projects .
