The youthful chairman of Motorola , Inc. acknowledges stem-winding introductions with a stock joke : " The most important reason for my rapid rise is that my dad owned the joint . " At Motorola , the success of Robert W. Galvin is no joke . When he took over from his father Paul , the company 's crusty , autocratic founder , Motorola had long been largely a one-man , one-product corporation . Galvin might have rested on his father 's laurels , but he elected to be his own man . In the five years since his father 's death , Bob , now 41 , has made Motorola a decentralized giant . Its projected $400 million in sales this year covers such a broad range of products and aptitudes that Motorola last week 1 ) won a contract to equip an eigtlt-mile stretch of New York 's crime-beleaguered subway system with an ex perimental two-way radio hookup for policemen , and 2 ) announced a new line of electronic circuits that will sell for as much as 77% less than present manufactured units . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-room Chicago loft , made mostly car radios until World War II , when it developed the walkie-talkies that became almost as universal as the Jeep . It still outsells all competitors in two-way radios for police cars , fire trucks , taxicabs and other vehicles , is also developing sophisticated models for space that will carry voices across 250,000 miles . <P> On top of this , Bob Galvin skillfully built the broad diversification begun by his father . The company pioneered the transistor radio , now also manufactures auto alternators and ignitions , electronic speedometers , hi-fi consoles , and exotic semiconductors and solid state devices used to measure and control industrial operations . Last year it introduced a 23-in. rectangular color-TV tube , slimmer and more compact than previous round tubes ; it expects to sell 100,000 this year , has jumped to third place in dollar volume of TV sales . " Once we identify ourselves with a field , " says Galvin , " we make a determined effort to be dominant in that field . " <P> Significant Decisions . Motorola has managed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , financing expansion largely from corporate funds ; last year it spent a lavish $48 million on research and capital in vestment . The company also makes a practice of promoting from within . <P> When Galvin two months ago moved up to chairman to concentrate on long-range planning ( he remains chief executive ) , he was succeeded as president by Elmer Wavering , 57 , who , like many other Motorola executives , joined the company in the early car-radio days . <P> <P> Galvin works easily with his executives , most of whom are much older than he . At Motorola 's shiny Franklin Park , Ill. , headquarters , where even the chairman works in shirtsleeves , he sees division heads intermittently , allows them full rein to handle engineering , production and sales and make significant decisions . " The most important factor motivating a manager , " says Galvin , " is his sense of proprietorship . The man who is given the greatest hand to determine his own destiny will try the hardest . It is fair to say that this is a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that Bob Galvin is a different sort of boss 's son .
