Even before the tax reduction , U.S. industry had plenty of money to spend for expansion and modernization-and good reason to spend it . Now , figuring that the cut will stimulate consumer demand , managers in companies as diverse as Allied Chemical , General Electric and Rockwell Manufacturing are re-evaluating their capital investment plans and reconsidering some projects once considered marginal . Whatever U.S. industry may add as a result of the tax reduction will improve what is already almost certain to become the best year ever for capital spending . In 1964 the oil industry plans to expand its capital budgets by 8% , the chemical industry by 11% , the paper manufacturers by 30% , and both the steelmakers and the automakers by 48% . <P> Profitable Incentive . Corporations will not collect the full benefit of the $2.4 billion drop in corporate taxes for a few years , * but the cut is only one of the factors encouraging them to spend . Profits after taxes have risen from $21.8 billion in 1961 to $27.2 billion in 1963 . There has been an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since companies are writing off more income in the form of depreciation expenses under the liberalized depreciation rules passed in 1962 . At the same time , rising orders for basic materials , industrial machines and other durable goods have pushed production beyond 85% of rated capacity , which is the point at which manufacturers generally decide to expand . Even in industries that have not reached that point-steel , for example , is operating at 75%-the pressure of competition is forcing businessmen to modernize and automate . <P> Such investments in productivity have actually been reducing the number of jobs in steel and some other industries , but many companies are expanding in a way that will create employment . A Chrysler assembly plant soon to be built in Belvidere , III. , will employ up to 5,000 , and General Motors ' new plant at Fremont , Calif. , has places for 4,100 . These projects will mean new orders and more jobs in such industries as machine tools , building equipment , office equipment , steel , glass and paint . To the delight of construction contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increasing the comforts of their employees by investing in attractive new headquarters , such as Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. ' s $20 million structure , designed by Architect Minoru Yamasaki . <P> The Bullish Force . In his television address to the nation , President Johnson passed along a prediction by a little-known Wall Street economist , Pierre Renfret , that business spending would grow by 20% this year-though he neglected to mention that Renfret meant only spending by manufacturing companies , expects overall spending to rise just 12% . That is still a pretty tall order , but one that the economy may well be able to fill in 1964 . <P> Government economists expect capital budgets to grow by 8% to 10% , moving into the $42 billion area , but many private economists forecast that the final figure will be higher . Rising even 8% , capital spending would expand faster than either consumer spending , Government outlays , or exports-and thus become the most buoyant force in the U.S. economy in 1964 . <P>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
