The saga of an impatient idealist who moved from jazz to this side of wisdom in search of a cause . While I was there , growing up detached , Roxbury was a Jewish ghetto in Boston . When I was about eight , thirty-five years ago , I saw my first community-action project . A new butcher shop had opened in Grove Hall , our agora , and a group of fiercely concerned citizens smashed its windows . Not a Jewish thing , you say , but the butcher shop was selling both kosher and non-kosher meats . It stopped . Roxbury has long since become a black ghetto , and shop windows in Grove Hall are occasionally being broken for other dedicated reasons these years . If I were to go back now , I 'd be the goy . But I was n't entirely at home then either . I liked the action , but I could n't connect with the holy raid on the butcher shop . I had dared God , in the synagogue on the Day of Atonement . to strike me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , because I 'd already stopped believing , but that was the last religious game I played . The secular action , as I grew older , was girls and politics . I went as far as I could with both , but Jewish girls then were tenaciously chaste ; and eventually Kafka made more sense to me than Roosevelt , Lenin , or Trotsky . There was also school , of course , and I did what / was told until halfway through the first year of graduate school . I felt no call to join the community of scholars , but it seemed a calm life , with long vacations , and if one were judicious in his associations there would be no reason to run afoul of the burgeoning Communist-hunters who , in those years . gave promise of being with us the rest of our lives . But it did n't work out . One night I went to the library , took out some ten books on James Fenimore Cooper and on Indians for a research paper , and just could n't begin . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned the books , left the library and Harvard for good . and ended the night sitting and listening to Sidney Bechet at the Savoy Caf ? . I could n't be a jazzman , never could improvise , but jazz did give me a vocation . I started writing about the music and the musicians , and fifteen years ago left the province of Boston to become New York editor of Down Beat . And it 's only since then that I 've come closer to finding what it is I can connect with . It did n't turn out to be jazz either . For several years the jazz life was the only one I knew . My criteria of wisdom were the Delphic grunts of Thelonious Monk ; I equated the ultimate in hip life-styles with the elegant alienation of Miles Davis ; and the guru of us all was Charlie Parker , whoever he was at any given moment ? enigmatically euphoric , distantly ironic , deliberately bland , fiercely defiant . What Che is to some of today 's young , Bird was to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution and the radical brotherhood of man by any means necessary . Bird , in the static early 1950s , was the man with the deck of identity cards . Outside as well as within jazz , the quest then was of self . Outside , analysis and group therapy were the rites of passage to what promised to be endless self-discoveries . Waking up cold in hand was waking up without a dream to write down . But how many dreams could be told to how many analysts before everyone was stone bored ? Soon Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg were to herald another Way , an expansion of consciousness on the road , and that in turn led to journeys into inner space , the hippies , and now their vacant faces as they mooch for spare change . Inside jazz , fifteen years ago , we looked to superspades to tell us who we were . The straight world ( called square then ) was frozen white in a hideous tableau ? Ike beaming beneficently into the middle distance and Senator Joe McCarthy holding up lists of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because we were in contact with the Life Force , the black soul . And since Bird was 82 TEMPTATIONS OF A BOSTON ATHEIST the primary avatar , he must have a message for each of us . Some listened to him and became junkies . ( " That 's not what I meant at all , " he said , but Godhead speaks elliptically , especially in its denials . ) Others interpreted him to mean that the music was All , and they tried to become their horns . Or , if they were not musicians , they trained ? in speech , gait , dress ? as acolytes . Others , puzzled , waited for a clearer sign , and then Bird died watching a comedian on television . For a while , " Bird Lives ! " was scrawled on posters and fences around New York and a few other hip cities . But the black young now have to be told who Charlie Parker was . Nor is Bird even a remote figure of legend to the new generation of white teen-agers . His jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the disciples of Bird , the hangers-on have scattered into limbo ; and the bop musicians work , when they can , with borrowed rhythm sections . Even on their intermittent gigs , I seldom hear them now . When I go out to listen , it 's much more likely to be for Janis Joplin or Albert Ayler . And there have been fewer and fewer nights left for music since jazz stopped being my primary preoccupation a couple of years after Bird died . Not because he died , but because out there ? beyond the jazz tribal grounds ? a movement was starting . The Movement , some called it , and I came along . Late one night , in the spring of 1960 , in Montgomery , Alabama , I walked toward a house , made harshly distinct by the spotlight trained on it . Ralph Abernathy 's home had been bombed a few nights before , and the light was there to scare away jackals . " Go ahead and get shot , " the white cab driver had said cheerily , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " I said , not so he would hear . Burly , slow-moving , Abernathy was the line , " We shall not be moved . " His father , he told me that night , had had his own farm . " I never worked a clay for a white man , " Abernathy said with satisfaction . He still has n't been moved , but now that he 's succeeded Martin Luther King as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , I have no idea where he can move to . The illusions of that time were contagiously energizing . Moral force , soul force , would cause the walls to come tumbling down . Black and white together , eating but dogs at Woolworth's. were the vanguard of the peaceful , revolutionary army . But a crisp , cutting voice was mocking the swaying singers of " We Shall Overcome . " I heard him on the radio before he became the beige Robespierre of black nationalism on television . I did n't know what he looked like when I arranged through a Muslim lattice-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Harlem . At a table on the side , an intimidatingly calm man had been assessing me for several minutes while everybody else acted as if 1 did n't exist and the jukebox played " A White Man 's Heaven Is a Black Man 's Hell . " Finally , he asked why I was there . " To meet Malcolm X. " " Sit down , " he said . I continued to see him through the years , first because he was a challenge ? to get through the reflexive irony that was part of his style in dealing with whites . Except for once , I was n't sure I ever did , but after he was killed , Alex Haley , who worked with Malcolm on his autobiography , told me Malcolm had said I was one of the few whites he felt like talking to . Call it an ego trophy , which it is , but it was also important to me because if a writer ca n't get through , he 's just a mirror , and Malcolm was the hardest man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him was the one contact during which no testing was going on . It was a week before he was assassinated . We met by accident in a radio station . He was afraid ; the only time I 'd seen fear in the man . The dry humor still flickered . He would n't let himself give way wholly to fear , and he told me a story about the hidden , quasi-revolutionary past of a now prominent Negro commentator . But he was tight , nervous . " It 's more than threats , " he said when I left . " They 're out to kill me . And it 's not Muhammad . " That 's all he said , that 's all 1 know . I had also continued to see him because he was a corrective balance during the " We Shall Overcome " phase of The Movement . In a hotel lobby , on the eve of the August 1963 March on Washington , I watched Malcolm surrounded by reporters as he sardonically skewered the festive fantasies of the marchers . He waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingenuous . I was annoyed . He 's just playing his role as Lucifer , I thought , but the next day , after the March , I was very depressed . What effect would all the speeches have ? All the moral force ? That huge , peaceful , integrated army that was so respectable and responsible that it cleared up its own debris ? Malcolm was right . The day had not been a beginning but rather the end of that phase of The Movement . During one of his trips abroad in the last years of his life , I got a postcard from him , glancingly presaging what he was to say in his speeches toward the end . A speech like one in May 1964 : " In my recent travels into the African countries and others , 1 was impressed by the importance of having a working unity among all peoples , black as well as white . But the only way this is going to be brought about is that the black ones have to be in unity first . " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forms of unity . And they 're doing it less through catalytic personalities ? although Eldridge Cleaver , if he can survive , may turn out to be Malcolm 's heir ? than by the more durable process of coming together on issues , like control of their own schools . It 's their putative white allies who are now looking for a home : trying to transform or found a political party ; using campus rebellions as a way to propel them into further movement . But as of the present , without cohesiveness , without clear direction . Part of the rhetoric of the singing years of The Movement was that blacks would liberate the whole country . But it is now all too evident that the white man 's burden is himself . Nonetheless there is , though confused and sometimes desperately manic , at least a persistent reaching out to possibility among many of the young . They have not all been codified yet , nor have they all slid into settling for just their own comfort . And it 's their work ? as teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of my writing about these years as one of my own ways of advocacy . But since I am forty-three , I see them in the particular , elongated context of other radicals . actual and aspiring , whom I 've known in the past decade and a half . Lenny Bruce , for instance . Lenny was not an ideologue ; he had no programmatic solutions for the plagues besetting the land . But he did help prepare the way for the current therapeutic contempt for euphemism . He shook his audiences to the roots of their ambivalence , about blacks , the Church ( any church ) , sex , vocation ( " I called the desk for a whore and they sent a bearded writer to my room " ) . And about the resplendent cultural pluralism in America which Max Lerner likes to write about and which Spiro Agnew so uniquely celebrated in the 1968 campaign . ( " Any spies , wops , niggers here tonight ? " Lenny would begin . " Any kikes ? " ) Lenny was a fundamentalist radical . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wobblies , but radicalism ? getting at the roots ? was his life style . In a nightclub or in his room at those hotels he chose which asked no questions of the hustlers and other marginal survivors passing through , Lenny kept upsetting shell games , including , so far as he could , his own . I thought of Lenny last spring when a reporter was interviewing a Columbia graduate student , a leader in both SDS and the local draft-resistance cadre . It was the day after a massive , brutal police bust ; the campus had been closed down by a retaliatory strike , led in large part by SDS . " Tell me , " the reporter asked , " how do you manage tuition and living expenses with all the time you spend on changing the system ? " " Oh . " said the bearded young man in a red beret , with a RESIST button on his military-style jacket , " I 'm on scholarship here . National Defense Education Act , Title Four . " Ai n't nobody pure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I particularly learned from Lenny was the importance of trying to remain as alert as possible to the artful dodger in us all . I see black militants who are as crudely manipulative as the paleolithic Mayor of Chicago . And when a young revolutionary tactician told me recently of how skillfully he had planted questioners in an audience to make sure a college president 's address turned into a stuttering disaster , I saw in his glow of self-satisfaction what some of young Stalin 's contemporaries might also have seen . " Civil liberties , " another young tribune of the New Society instructs me , " are a bourgeois relic . " And I know that my enemy can come in all kinds of guises . I remember talking with and being charmed by Che Guevara a few years ago . The radical brotherhood of man was his theme ; but when I asked him about dissent , not subversion , in Cuba , I knew as he coolly measured me that while I would have been for Fidel against Batista , at some point later Che could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the people 's jails . As Fidel , the celebrator of national self-determination , considered it necessary to support the Russian occupation of Czechoslovakia the summer last . The temptation for an advocacy writer is to so yearn to be " relevant " as the winds change and the crises come more quickly that he finds himself stumbling to someone else 's beat . " Which side are you on ? " Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie used to sing . But there are often more than two . When a young black commando in East Harlem told me last spring that the only thing whites could do to prove they were on the side of black liberation was to supply guns or money for guns , 1 kept my hands in my pockets and instead continued to write and organize for white support of black and Puerto Rican control of the schools in their communities . Gunrunning is not my calling , particularly when I do n't know who the targets arc . It may complete the circle of white guilt to be killed by a gun you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . On the other hand , a few years ago , under the influence of several pacifists whose spiritual development clearly surpassed mine , I tried to become totally nonviolent . Bul then a man I 'd criticized in print called me in the middle of the night to assure me he would pull my beard out by the roots the next day , and I carried a knife for the next week That cleared that up . Trying to make sure I 'm really where I say I am , 84 TEMPTATIONS OF A BOSTON ATHEIST I 've found some guidelines . Some years ago I read in Georges Bernanos : The horrors which we have seen , the still greater horrors we shall presently see , are not signs that rebels , insubordinate , untamable men , are increasing in numbers throughout the world , but rather that there is a constant increase , a stupendously rapid increase in the number of obedient , docile men . " There are times , like the present , when even though the rebels are indeed increasing , they are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obedient and docile , that a writer , looking at the odds , might well be wise to retreat into aesthetics ? novels , poems , and other solitary charms against the still greater horrors we shall presently see . Art , if that 's what it turns out to be , may last , but with few exceptions , topical writing only provides raw material for distant , tranquil historians . Yet , even if the odds continue to widen , I ca n't stop reading the papers and splitting my work accordingly . " When I visit New York , " Canadian filmmaker Allan King told the New York Times last fall , " it always takes me two or three days to inure myself to the bitterness on the faces of all those people living in that enormous garbage can between Manhattan and Kennedy airport . It just eats people alive ! " I see John Lindsay trying to scrape up enough money just to keep the enormous garbage can from turning into a charnel house ; and I 'm writing a book on what he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't got ? to make New York livable . Will it and similar books on the cities change the mind of one Congressman or sufficiently alarm some voters in their own garbage cans to move them to put different men in Congress and in municipal office ? Who can know ? There are very few advocacy writers ? Ralph Nader is a notable exception ? who can see direct change resulting from their articles and books . The rest are like Sisyphus and feel . I suppose . that at least the stone they 're pushing up the hill is there , is palpable . and so is to be preferred to watching from the sidelines and ineanting T. S. Eliot : " The land is foul , the water is foul , our beasts and ourselves defiled with blood . " Besides , being there has its satisfactions , quite apart from whether you ever get any stone to stay on top of any hill . It can suddenly give you an extraordinarily clear ? if freezing ? sense of the exact weak center of your time . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are obedient , will always be associated for me with Adlai Stevenson on a particular afternoon . In June 1965 , three weeks before his death , I was part of a delegation ? social critics , a novelist and poet , a former Congressman ? who met with . Stevenson in his office at the United States Mission to the United Nations . We were there to ask him to resign and to lead the movement against the war . I do n't think any of us really expected him even to consider resigning and yet for some , this visit was a last , however unrealistic , appeal to the apotheosis of humane liberalism which Stevenson had represented in his 1952 campaign for the Presidency . And it was also an appeal out of our own impotence . We did not know how to stop the war , and with Bobby Kennedy not yet in opposition and Eugene McCarthy so docile then we never even thought of him , Stevenson seemed to be the one " respectable " political figure who might be able to rally all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what to do . And for me , there was also the curiosity to see for myself why this man , who had meant a great deal to me during part of my twenties , was ending his public life as a liar for his country at the United Nations . I am wary of charm in government officials because it resembles the manners of exceptionally skillful morticians . ( One of John Lindsay 's reassuring qualities is the profane irreverence of many of his private comments . ) But Stevenson 's charm was the most difficult to resist I 've ever experienced . When a man is as genuinely gracious , as unfeignedly courtly as Stevenson was , it is difficult to indict him to his face for complicity in murder . Today 's radical young are better at it . I do n't imagine Mark Rudd would have had any hesitancy greeting Stevenson with " Up against the wall , motherfucker ! " But what I saw and reacted to was an encapsulated man who wanted something of us . God knows what it was . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must certainly understand what the rules of the game are . Surely now that we saw and talked to him , we would realize that his essential humanity had not changed and we would recognize the reality of his situation . This was implicit , not explicit , in the conversation ; but he was clearly trying to make us see that he still had access to power , that he could perhaps yet get Lyndon Johnson to bend . But if he did what we asked of him , what would he be then ? A silly , undignified figure , wholly removed from the sources of power , a balding Don Quixote with a raggedy collection of imperious individualists snapping at his heels , We were far too few , the feeling of the country was still far from sufficiently roiled . We were making absurd , almost insane demands of him . Morality is one thing , but exile is another . The talk was first about American intervention in the Dominican Republic the preceding April . Briefly , awkwardly , Stevenson tried to defend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that finally he tacitly conceded the argument by not continuing it . My attention wandered as the rest of the time was spent on Vietnam . I knew the questions and could predict the answers ; at times , instead of following the play , I watched his eyes . A very clear blue . As a politician and diplomat , he 'd had much experience in keeping them clear of whatever he was feeling . But there were moments of open vulnerability . There was hurt when the truthfulness of a past statement by him was being shredded . Alarm at another point . I do n't know at what . He was being pressed hard and perhaps he was afraid he might succumb to spontaneity and say something in exculpation which could deeply embarrass him later when he 'd have to insist he 'd been misquoted . As a gracious man , it would be painful for him to imply that we were liars . After about an hour , he took firm hold of himself and was a thoroughly professional player of the game for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , he shook our hands . You honor me by coming , " he said . " 1 do not have the chance often these days to have this kind of dialogue . " He seemed to really mean it , but actually it had been more a duel than a dialogue . He had withstood our attempts to change the rules by which he lived , but he appeared to have experienced no pleasure or relief in proving his steadfastness . We left him as we found him . When he died on a London street the next month , 1 was saddened , but not so much as I had been on leaving him that afternoon . The middle-aged who still wonder why " liberal " is an epithet to many of the young might think on A dlai Stevenson . During that period , and fora couple of years before . I 'd been gathering material for a book on an old man , A.J. Muste , a radical pacifist of remarkably wide influence , though he was unknown to most of the populace . Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania , he had heard A.J. lecture . " I was n't a pacifist then , " King recalled , " but the power of A.J. 's sincerity and his hardheaded ability to defend his position stayed with me through the years . " But A.J. was n't a single-issue pacifist . " We ca n't have peace , " he 'd say , " if we 're only concerned with peace . War is not an accident . It is the logical outcome of a certain way of life . If we want to attack war , we have to attack that way of life . " And in his long life ? by his articles , his constant traveling to speak and witness , his extraordinary ability to hold the trust of many otherwise disparate dissenters ? he affected the ways in which many men mounted that attack . They ranged from Kenneth Kaunda through American labor activists , divinity students , teachers , and such of the young as David Miller , one of the first of the draft-card burners . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that knowing A.J. led " to the death of a liberal and to the destruction of cherished liberal standards . It is simply not possible , after once having been a part of A.J. 's life , to have an isolated , uninvolved life of one 's own . " I distrust that kind of generality , however generously intended . I can only tell of myself . A.J. influenced me more than any other man I 've ever known . I remained an atheist , which he was n't . I failed , as I 've noted , to be a pacifist for very long . But A.J ? did make clear to me the fundamental choice of this time : " Precisely in a day when the individual appears to be utterly helpless , to ' have no choice , ' when the aim of the ' system ' is to convince him that he is helpless as an individual and that the only way to meet regimentation is by regimentation , there is absolutely no hope save in going back to the beginning . The human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must understand that this naked human being is the one real thing in the face of the mechanics and the mechanical institutions of our age . " It 's not much of a program , I admit , but it is a starting place . No one is naked . Even A.J. was rather distant personally . But there are always those who are immediately distinguishable by their stubborn assertion of their humanity . Some are gloriously stubborn , like Marie Nyswander , a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst specializing in drug addiction , about whom I wrote a hook . One afternoon she was railing against the way her profession is usually practiced : " Many psychoanalysts reduce all of life to a jargon . A safe jargon . They 86 TEMPTATIONS OF A BOSTON ATHEIST wo n't depart from middle-class customs and values . But analysis ought to free you . Free you to experience joy and tragedy on a higher level than the interpersonal family level of relating to mother , husband , wife , or children . Suppose a patient has finished his analysis . An analyst might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for what ? Has he been made into a little aggressive island only large enough to include his wife and children ? I 'd feel greatly disappointed if someone I considered I 'd analyzed found such a sterile solution for his life . Is this what there is to life ? We still know so little about man 's capacity for creativity , for experiencing beauty , for freedom of a degree we ca n't even imagine . We have to keep going into the unknown . " She 's right ; I ca n't even imagine it either . But the sound moved me , like Coltrane 's . And increasingly , in education , particularly in ghetto schools , I 've found others like Marie , those whom Bernanos called the untamables . I wrote Our Children Are Dying about Elliott Shapiro , one of the last white principals in Harlem to whom an oncoming delegation of parents was not notice of a coup d'e.tat ; and I 'm working now on a profile of Ronald Evans , the black principal of P.S. 201 in East Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when I 'm doing leg work and rarely when I write , any real hope I have of changing the way of life that brings us into war , civil and foreign , is largely based on education . There is a new movement now , among students and young teachers , to liberate education , to go back to the beginning , to the naked human being , and let him grow into the unknown . Yes , much will have to change outside the schools as well , but the schools are where petrifaction now begins , and if they remain the same , the rebels will continue to be too few . Meanwhile , with some current rebels proclaiming , " The streets belong to the people ! " and intermittent pronunciamentos on guerrilla warfare circulating , it nonetheless remains evident that the only kind of violent American revolution possible is one ending in totalitarianism , no matter who starts it . Basic , though limited , institutional changes through political and other forms of organized pressure may happen in particular communities ; and even nationally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barring what has come to be the customarily unexpected , Richard Nixon will be ending his second term of office in eight years , and I do not then expect to see Mark Rudd or Eldridge Cleaver in the wings . What I do hope to see in the next eight years , in addition to the thrust toward liberation of the schools , is the continued growth of a new kind of radical humanist professional ? advocacy lawyers , architects , clergymen , doctors , urbanists . People not content to spend their lives fortifying smallaggressive islands . This is the direction being explored by an unprecedented number of the young ? the former awakeners of the countryside for Gene McCarthy , former SDS members , and those of the unaffiliated who also want a sense of community . It 's still such a fragile concept ? a sense of community . An intention only . And except for a relatively few , it may be no more than that eight years from now , and beyond . I am old enough not to be surprised each time a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wholly nonviolent , once seemingly legion , have all but gone . Dorothy Day of The Catholic Worker and a few others persist , but any Marches on Washington for a long time to come will be accompanied by police helicopters and regiments of National Guardsmen at the ready . Racial integration is again an individual decision ; there is no " movement " any longer behind it . And the present focus on radical professionalism may become blurred until there are again only the isolated radical professionals . But if it comes to that , there are far worse ways of staying alive . In April 1966 , A.J. Muste , eighty-one , flew to Saigon . " You see , " he explained , " as we 've made our voices heard at home , we must also speak to the people of Vietnam . We have sought to speak truth to power at centers where war measures were being planned , where men were being drafted and engines of mass destruction were being made ; we come now to the scene where the fighting and slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were disrupted by agents of the South Vietnamese government , and soon he and his companions were arrested . Barbara Deming , who was with him , remembers that " when they had put us finally in a kind of detention room out at the airport ? where we were to wait for the departure of the next plane , on which they would send us away ? I looked across the room at A.J. to see how he was doing . I might add that it was a broiling hot day and we had spent some time just sitting in the paddy wagon out under the full sun , and that had n't been easy for him . I looked across at him and he looked back with a smile , and with that sudden lighting up of his eyes which many of his friends will remember , and he said , ' It 's a good life l ' He had done what he thought had to be clone ( that trip was above all his idea ) , and he had done it as well as he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What more could he do ? until the next time ? " It may come down to only that , Nothing may change significantly , or things may get worse . But so long as there is a next time , you do what there is to be done . For me , it 's a better life than making connections between James Fenimore Cooper and Indians . Years later , by the way , someone told me Cooper had n't known any Indians . I never checked that out .
