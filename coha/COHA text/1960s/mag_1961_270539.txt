The Roman Catholic Church 's once-and-for-all view of marriage causes more problems , more suffering-and more apostasy from the church-than most non-Catholics suspect . Marriage is merely legalized adultery in the eyes of the church if either of the partners has a living spouse to whom he was validly married ( which may include ceremonies in other faiths and even civil ceremonies ) . Example : a Catholic divorced and remarried is considered to be living in sin . What happens if the couple want to make their peace with the church and receive the sacraments ? * Must they dissolve their marriage , divide up the children and live apart ? <P> There is another alternative , not often granted by the church , known as the brother-sister vow-in which a man and woman are permitted to live in public as man and wife , but in private must be as chaste as brother and sister . The true story of one couple 's struggle to achieve this relationship is poignantly told in a new book , Whom God Hath Not Joined , by a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward ; $3 ) . <P> A Neat Trick . " Claire McAuley " was married in the church at the age of 18 , and two years later , " after a series of misfortunes which eventually saw my legal , valid husband behind bars and bigamously married to another , " her bishop granted her permission to get a civil divorce . Thus at 20 , the mother of a small son , she found herself legally free but ecclesiastically still married . When she met the man she " realized was the one with whom I should spend the rest of my life , " she was confident God understood that her first marriage had not been a marriage at all-even if the church chose to be legalistic about it . So she married him in a civil ceremony , and he-a baptized Catholic who knew nothing about the church 's teaching-settled down with her . Eventually they had three children . <P> But Claire McAuley gradually began to be nagged by doubt that God " understood " so well , after all , and that through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perdition , " not only for herself but for the man she loved . In an agony of conscience , she appealed again and again to her parish priest . She had never heard of the brother-sister vow , but had come to the conclusion that she and John could stay together if only they avoided " adultery , " i.e. , sex ( " A neat trick , if you happen to be quite young , quite normal , and very much in love " ) . Her priest obviously felt the trick was all but impossible ; he offered her no hope of returning to full Communion , short of breaking up her life with John . <P> The Bishop 's Worry . John at first treated Claire 's soul-searching as a phase that would pass , then as a cruel denial of his conjugal rights . There were violent quarrels . But as Claire persevered , John slowly began to see things her way , and they began searching for a priest who would help them get a bishop 's permission to take the brother-sister vow .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
