Whether to beg a boon or pick a bone , the man of action has always known where to go and whom to complain to . Job , for example , went straight to the top , while others took their problems to lesser officials , settled , like Juliet , for a friar ; like Aladdin , for a genie ; like Oedipus , for an oracle ; or like Dorothy , for an available wizard . It is only modern man-charged with an item he did not purchase , in arrears on accounts he has long since paid , his mail misdirected , his drains stopped up , toaster broken or license expired-who does not know where to turn . <P> The world is full of such beleaguered souls , looking , like Kafka 's Joseph K , for someone authorized to cope . And naturally enough , this modern dilemma reaches an apogee of sorts in New York , the world 's most modern city . There , the tenant who pays some $250 for his apartment is likely to find the price does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracked down ; faced with a leak that ca n't be stopped , and no one but his wife who cares , he must plunge into the morass of building regulations . <P> Ear , Name &; Number . First , of course , comes the matter of the nature of the leak . If it comes from a sink , it falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Buildings , if from a toilet ( sewage ) , the Department of Health .

The situation in New York , in fact , is so tricky and convoluted that , were it not for a volunteer angel named Ellen Straus , the city would even now be shoulder-high in stagnant water . <P> Mrs. Straus , wife of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who decided a year and a half ago to " bring about a system to end all the chaos . " With a volunteer staff of 25 ( including socialites and civic leaders ) , one secretary ( Columnist Max Lerner 's daughter ) and five telephones , Call for Action set up shop . Sparked by spot announcements over ( naturally ) WMCA assuring listeners that a phone call to the group would expedite a complaint , Call has handled complaints from nearly 15,000 natives suddenly afforded a sympathetic ear and , more important , the name and telephone number of the proper municipal authority to call . In addition to telephone guidance , Call for Action has assembled and published a neatly tabbed book listing 18 of the city 's agencies , with a cross-index linking each problem with cause and solution . <P> Pets &; Smoke . Under " Pets , " The Book You Should n't Need provides the information that if the neighbor 's dog is keeping you awake by nightlong barking , you call the Police Department . If the annoyance is merely smelly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Buildings . But if the neighboring pet turns out to be a jaguar ( fond of dropping in through your window unannounced and at odd hours ) , the appeal is to the Health Department ( keeping dangerous animals without proper safeguards ) .
