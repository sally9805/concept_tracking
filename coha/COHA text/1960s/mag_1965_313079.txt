On a wall in East Boston , one embittered Italian-American scrawled-'Leif Ericsson is a fink . " In other cities across the U.S. , indignant sons of Italy and politicians eager for their votes , reacted in like manner to word that Yale University had acquired a medieval map containing additional evidence that Leif Ericsson , riding the wild Atlantic winds reached the North American shore about the year 1000 ( TIME , Oct. 15 ) . Though Leif 's landing is hardly news in scholarly circles , Yale 's just-before-Columbus Day announcement stirred a storm of popular protest strong enough to have blown his longships all the way back to Norway . <P> In Chicago , Columbus Day Parade Chairman Victor Arrigo denounced the Yale map as a " Communist plot . " New Jersey 's Republican Senator Clifford Case , on hand for Newark 's parade curtly dismissed Ericsson as " just an upstart . " Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Michael Musmanno , author of The Story of the Italians in America charged that the Yalemen " have gone into the moss-covered kitchen of rumor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ethnic prejudices have warmed over the stale cabbage of Leifs discovery of America . " In the House , New York Democrat Benjamin Rosenthal introduced a bill to make Columbus Day a national legal holiday . <P> Yale to the Wall .

Yale-educated Congressman John Lindsay Republican candidate for mayor , made it sound as if Columbia had been his alma mater all along . " Saying that Columbus did not discover America , " declared Lindsay , " is as silly as saying DiMaggio does n't know anything about baseball or that Toscanini and Caruso were not great musicians . " Governor Nelson Rockefeller , whose son , Steven , has a Norwegian wife , at first voyaged rather bravely into the controversy : " As far as the impact of Columbus ' voyage is concerned , he discovered America . " Later he carefully added that he did not mean to take anything away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viking daughter-in-law myself . " <P> Speaking for irate Italians everywhere , John N. ( for Napoleon ) La Corte , general director of the Italian Historical Society of America , warned directly : We are going to put Yale against the wall . La Corte threatened to enlist the National Geographic Society in support of Columbus , but dropped the idea when he learned it was the Geographic that sponsored the 1963 excavation of a Scandinavian village in Newfoundland that dates from about 1000 A.D.
