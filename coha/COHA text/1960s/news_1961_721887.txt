txt A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts . There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics . The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are " all the same . " " It 's ' See Joe , see Jim , ' " he says . " The hand is out . " A political scientist writes of the growth of " alienated voters , " who " believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . * * * These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them . " Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor 's novel , " The Last Hurrah . " But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works has brought on state and Federal investigations . And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life . Day after day some new episode is reported . The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent 8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property . An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate . Then it turns out that the // " He sought to sell voting machines to municipal officers who might later seek favorable votes for municipal legislation in the Senate. ? A former State Attorney General , Francis E. Kelly , a Democrat , represented a number of private clients in damage suits against a state agency while he was the state 's chief legal officer in the early Nineteen Fifties . But these are relatively trivial incidents compared with the major Massachusetts scandals of the last year . The first concerned the Metropolitan District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and sewage eisnosal in and around Boston . Asa result of a state Senate inquiry and other proceedings , two top officials of the commission stand convicted on criminal charges . The Senate inquiry found that the commission had spent its money in unusual ways . $5,000 to Report on Pool For example , it paid a swimming coach $5,000 for a report on the " desirable characteristics of a pool " it was going to build . The Senate inquiry said the need for such advice was  --  the scure , because the M. D. C. had already built several pools . " Another consultant on a different swimming pool was paid 517,000 . All he did , according to the investigators , was to use specifications that had been given to him free by a pool manufacturer and , in suggesting a bathhouse design , to copy the plan of another commission bathhouse . The investigating committee found that the commission had ordered items from contractors that it did not need , apparently to make the contracts more profitable . One contract required the cantractor to supply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the according to the committee . A constant practice of the ' district commission was to break its projects into contracts of less than $1,000 each . The Senati committee suggested that the reason was that state law relmires competitive bidding on alt contracts of more than $4000 . Billing Denounced Contractors , the investigating committee said , " billed the , Me D. C. without regard to the fair value of the work done or a fair profit to themselves . Each took as a yardstick the starting point of $1,000 ( and picked some figure as close to $1,000 as their courage permitted . " The committee found that on some jobs the contractors had done no work , and on most jobs only part of the contracted project . In " an overwhelming majority " of instances , the commettee said , the work done " was sloppy , shoddy , unworkmanlike and an outright public didgrace . " The head of the agency , Commissioner John E. Maloney , was also the 40 per cent owner of . an insurance agency that received many commissions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an associate commissioner , was the local distributor for one kind of highway guard rail . The M. D. C. bought large quantities of this kind of rail , producing net profits of about 60 per cent for the distributing company on each sale . Commissioners Fined Maloney and McCarty resigned from the commission as a result of the inquiry , and both were indicted on conflict of interest charges . Maloney pleaded guilty and was fined $16,000 . McCarty was convicted , fined $7,000 and given a suspended jail sentence of eighteen months . One item in the inquiry is unresolved . State Representative Charles Ianello , a Democrat , is on trial along with his wife and daughter on charges of larceny and conspiracy . The charge is that , while Mr. Ianello was vice chairman of A legislative commission to investigate the commission , construction companies of the Ianello family got most of the commission 's sidewalk contracts  --  and charged ? the commission for work not done . A second highly publicized inquiry centers on the state Public Works Department , which builds Massachusetts ' highways . ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called attention to the ways of political patronage in the Public Works Department . The department , it was reported , did favors for a favored few by renting equipment from them  --  trucks , lawn mowers and the like . Members of the Legislature , their relatives , ' Gov . Foster Furcolo 's military aide , town political chairmen , campaign managers , state and city employes  --  Republicans and Democrats alike  --  were among the lessors . Representative Ianello 's wife , Dorothy , rented what Mr. Ianello called a " couple of broken-down trucks " to the department . He explained that they had made no profit and were doing it only " to create a couple of jobs for a couple of married guys in my district . " $160 for a Saw A legislator 's son made $140 a week driving his station wagon for the department . An- , other man rented an electric saw to the agency for $160 a week , without an operator . Newspaper men were hired as " traffic consultants . " A highly placed politician was quoted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a steam shovel . " Rent it to the state , " he is reported to have said . " It will solve all your problems . You , wo n't even have to charge any more dues . " Another idea was the hiring of politicians ' friends as " highway inspectors . " Groups of four were paid $70 a week each to sit in a car five hours a day and count traffic . Last fall a state Senate committee conducted an inquiry into the Public Works Department that was widely denounced as a whitewash . Engineer Criticized The committee found the practice of dividing contracts into pieces of less than $1,000 . It noted that surveyors had ' collected per diem fees on the day of a record blizzard . - It criticized a consulting engineer , J. L. Hayden , because he could not show how he had arrived at a fee of $84,000 that he charged on one job . In three years Mr. Hayden collected nearly $2,500,000 from the state in consulting fees . Representative Ianello was subpoenaed by the Senate committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The committee said it could not find his daughter or son-in-law to serve them subpoenas . Meanwhile , the Federal Government moved in . Its main interest was in the prices paid by the Public Works Department for rights of way on highways aided by Federal funds . More than a year ago the Bureau of Public Roads in Washington froze all Federal funds for land acquisition on tlassachusetts highways . Bureau officials said they had found that some appraisals in the state had been " far in excess of true market values . " Want Funds Released More than $12,000,000 has now accumulated in these frozen funds . Massachusetts officials have demanded that the money be released and have denounced the bureau for refusing to tell them whom it suspects . The Federal case has been put to a Federal grand jury . The jury has been sitting intermittently since last fall , examining witnesses and hearing reports from the Federal Bureau of Investigation , In April the United States Attorney , Elliot L. Richardson , was reported ready to recommend some indictments . Then Mr. Richardson , a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice by a Democrat , W. Arthur Garrity Jr . The circumstances of this shift are in dispute . Some Republicans charge that it was a move to block action on highway wrongdoing . Some Democrats say Mr. Richardson was pressing for indictments on insufficient evidence . In any case , Mr. Garrity is continuing the investigation . House Inquiry Begun A parallel Federal inquiry is being conducted by a House Highways subcommittee headed by Representative John A. Blatnik , Democrat of Minnesota . It has two investigators working full time in Massachusetts on the federally aided highways program . The House committee , however , has conducted no hearings in its Massachusetts investigation . ' Republicans have charged " whitewash . " They have suggested that Mr. Blatnik is deferring to the wishes of the House majority leader , Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts . Mr. Blatnik calls this " blatant Republican hypocrisy . " He says the information in hand does not justify public hearings . The one agency that has not investigated the Public Works Department thus far is the one with the broadest powers to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attorney general is Edward J. McCormack Jr. , Representative McCormack 's nephew . He explained that he had held off because so many other inquiries were in progress . Others suggested that Mr. McCormack might be reluctant for other reasons . One observer said : " I do n't question his honesty . But why dig things up ? You never can tell where it will end . " One reason for suspicion about the Public Works Department is the testimony on past practices in the department in the most important of the scandal explosions to hit Massachusetts in the last year  --  the case of Thomas Worcester . Worcester , a consulting engineer , designed highways and other projects for the Public Works Department and other state agencies . He was indicted by a Federal grand jury for tax evasion in deducting bribes as business expenses . Offered Leniency Last summer Worcester was tried and convicted by a jury . Federal Judge Charles E. Wyzanski Jr . offered to give him a suspended sentence if he would tell the truth about the bribes . Worcester agreed , and testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made public . Worcester 's - story was that he had been approached by the late Francis Norton , a " salesman " who said he had an " in " with public officials and could get business for Worcester 's concern . Worcester hired Norton . Between 1948 and 1952 Worcester received $2,750,000 in contracts from public agencies . He testified that he had given 10 per cent of that total . $275,000 , to Norton . Worcester also testified that he had hired a number of political figures , either at Norton 's suggestion or because it appeared to be the thing to do . Most of these men later corroborated Worcester 's testimony about them . A Boston city councilor . Vincent J. Shanley , was paid $50 a week for seventy-seven weeks as a public relations man . He said Gov . Paul Dever , a Democrat , had sent him to Thomas Worcester , Inc. , for the job . All he did , he said , was to interview a few persons on their attitude on regional incinerators . Says He Did No Work John G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was sent over by a girl in Governor Dever 's office . He made $75 a week for six weeks and testified that he had done no work . Edward M. Rowe , a former Republican state Senator , was on the payroll for $20,000 ? because , Worcester said , the Democrats wanted Mr , Rowe in the Republican primary for Governor to divide the . Republicans . Mr. Rowe ran in the primary , in 1950 , and lost . James A , Burke , then a member of the Legislature , now a Democrat in the national House ) of Representatives , said Governor Dever sent him to the Worcester concern in 1950 , when he needed work . He made $450 in six weeks as a clerk and said he had earned it . The testimony of these men was given at an extraordinary hearing conducted by Judge Wyzanski . The purpose was to see whether Worcester had kept his part of the bargain for the suspended sentence ? whether he had been truthful . After Worcester 's grand jury testimony was made public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their versions and were questioned by Worcester 's counsel , by Mr. Richardson and by Judge Wyzanski . Finds Testimony ' Credible ' Judge Wyzanski handed down an opinion saying that he believed Worceseter . The judge said he had " found Worcester 's testimony before me candid , credible , complete . " In the opinion , Judge Wyzanski went on to discuss what he termed the " sordid racket of extortion , bribery and corruption . " He raised a number of questions that , in effect , suggested the existence of widespread moral decay . " Can it be true , " he asked , " that of the successful bidders for contracts with the state Worcester alone paid bribes and took them as deductions from Federal income tax ? " The Internal Revenue Service has undertaken to answer that question . It is conducting a large-scale investigation of persons connected with Massachusetts public works projects in the years since Worcester 's operations . The judge was also implicitly critical of the press , the bar and other parts of society . " How much has the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " How far has the bar initiated reform based upon its daily experience with the sufferings its clients have undergone at the hands of a network of corruption ? " Were sophisticated lawyers unaware , before this case began , that to secure certain types of public business a contractor had to get his performance bond , or his materialman 's bond , or his bond for wages , or his trustees ' bond , from a relative of a judge , or a public official , or of a legislator ? " Conduct Criticized Judge Wyzanski 's conduct of the Worcester hearing has been I widely criticized . The complaint ' is that he pilloried witnesses in public and that he acted , in general , more like a prosecuting attorney than a judge . On the other hand , many persons believe that Judge Wyzan Iski performed what one lawyer called " a great public service . " They believe that the judge said things that desperately needed saying and brought forcefully into public view practices that had always been kept under cover .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
