" Faster , Higher , Stronger " is the motto of the Olympic Games . " Angrier , nastier , uglier " better describes the scene in Mexico City last week . There , in the same stadium from which 6,200 pigeons swooped skyward to signify the opening of the " Peace Olympics , " Sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos , two disaffected black athletes from the U.S. put on a public display of petulance that sparked one of the most unpleasant controversies in Olympic history and turned the high drama of the games into theater of the absurd . <P> Smith had just won the 200-meter dash in a record-breaking 19.8 sec . Carlos , his bearded teammate from San Jose State College , had finished third . Together , they turned up for the awards ceremony shoeless , wearing knee-length black stockings and a black glove on one hand ( the right for Tommie , the left for John ) . Along with Australia 's Peter Norman , the second-place finisher , they mounted the victory pedestal to receive their medals . Then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Star-Spangled Banner , the two black athletes bowed their heads and raised their gloved hands in a clenched-fist salute . A wave of boos rippled through the spectators as the pair left the field . Smith and Carlos responded by making interesting gestures at the stands . <P> At a press conference later , the two men explained that the black stockings represented poverty ; the black fists meant black power and black unity . Said Smith : " We are black and proud to be black . White America will say ' an American won , ' not ' a black American won . ' If it had been something bad , they would have said ' a Negro . ' " Added Carlos , somewhat disjointedly : " White people seem to think we 're animals . I want people to know we 're not animals , not inferior animals , like cats and rats . They think we 're some sort of show horse . They think we can perform and they will throw us some peanuts and say ' Good boy , good boy . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling attention to racial strife in the U.S. , the demonstration was undeniably effective . But it was also painfully petty . East Germans , Russians , even Cubans , all stand at attention when The Star-Spangled Banner or any other national anthem is played . Other equally militant U.S. black athletes were aghast at Smith and Carlos ' actions . " I came here to win a gold medal-not to talk about black power , " said Ohio 's Willie Davenport next day after winning the 110-meter high hurdles . He stood straight and tall and proud on the Olympic pedestal .
