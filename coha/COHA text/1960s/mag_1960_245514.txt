By common consent in Accra , President Kwame Nkrumah , 51 , is far too big a man for a small ( pop . 6,000,000 ) land like Ghana ; all his admirers think that Osagyefo ( Great Man ) , as he is known around town , should be shared with the rest of Africa . No one endorses this thesis more enthusiastically than Osagyefo himself , who has made almost a fulltime career of meddling in the affairs of other African nations . <P> <P> Nkrumah 's slogan is Pan-Africanism , but his neighbors have long been convinced that the main target is extension of Ghana's-and Nkrumah's-own realm . Early this year , he espoused the cause of the dissident Sanwi tribesmen in the Ivory Coast on his western border , with the clear aim of winning their territory over to Ghana ; on his east , he tried the same tactics with the Ewe tribal groups in hopes of disrupting newly independent Togo . <P> Vanishing Respect . For his trouble , Nkrumah gained nothing more than the suspicion of African leaders who once respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast 's urbane President Felix Houphouet-Boigny : " I must make it clear to Nkrumah that he has neither the right nor the means to annex the smallest piece of the Ivory Coast . " Asked Togo 's Premier Sylvanus Olympio : " Does he really expect to absorb us with his puny bunch of tin soldiers and those two minesweepers he calls a navy ? The man must be crazy ! " <P> Failing to extend his own borders , Nkrumah then turned to grandiose but empty schemes like the wildly trumpeted Ghana-Guinea " union , " an unlikely alliance in which Guineans who spoke only French were expected to sit in on Accra Cabinet meetings with Ghanaians who spoke only English , and vice versa . When Guinea 's Sekou Toure got the $11 million loan from Nkrumah ' that went with the deal , he contemptuously let the rest of the arrangement-one flag , common currency , customs union-slide into oblivion . <P> <P> Try , Try Again . But the worst debacle was Nkrumah 's clumsy intervention in the Congo 's chaos . " Whenever in doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier Patrice Lumumba in September . " We have been in the game for some time now , and we know how to handle the imperialists . " ( As a Commonwealth Prime Minister , Nkrumah delights in his status as a member of the Queen 's Privy Council , but never loses a chance to belabor " Brit ish imperialists " . ) Last week , with Lumumba in a jail cell and President Kasavubu recognized by the U.N . as the Congo 's legitimate ruler , it was clear that Nkrumah had bet on the wrong man in the Congo ; his own Ghanaian charge d'affaires , ham-handed Nathaniel Welbeck , had been thrown out of Lopoldville in disgrace and the latest planeload of diplomatic replacements from Accra turned back and sent home . Once again , Osagyefo 's foreign policy was in tatters.
