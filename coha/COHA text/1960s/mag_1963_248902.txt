Civil rights legislation last week was in a terrible tangle in the House Judiciary Committee . It would have been laughable if it were not so lamentable . <P> Still at issue was a civil rights bill produced by an eleven-member Judiciary subcommittee chaired by Brooklyn 's civil righteous Democratic Representative Emanuel Celler , who also heads the full Judiciary Committee . That bill went far beyond what the Kennedy Administration had asked-and far beyond what either the House or the Senate would accept . <P> The Administration , fearful that the barbed-wire subcommittee bill would snag all chances for civil rights legislation this year , put Celler under heavy pressure to back down and support a more moderate measure . He agreed , and with the help of Ohio Republican William McCulloch , ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee , put together a shaky coalition in favor of modifying the subcommittee bill . <P> The Face on the Screen . Early last week that coalition was busted wide open-and the unlikely Congressman who started the smashing was Roland V. Libonati , 62 , a pudgy little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1957 , " Lib " Libonati has been known only for his devotion to the bidding of Chicago 's Mayor Richard Daley and as a master of the malapropism-he once welcomed autumn as the time when " the moss is on the pumpkin . " Gingerly handling the prickly political pear that the civil rights bill had become , Manny Celler needed someone to make the necessary Judiciary Committee motions to delete the toughest sections of the subcommittee package . He picked Libonati , partly because of Lib 's record of strict party obedience , partly because Lib did not need to worry about political repercussions in his machine-run district . <P> <P> Libonati was happy to oblige , and all might have gone well-if Celler had kept his mouth shut and if Lib were not a televiewer . But Celler submitted to a television interview , Libonati caught the show , and did not like what he heard . Explained Libonati later : <P> " So then I 'm sitting down , just like you and me are sitting here now , and I 'm watching television and who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's telling ' em up there in his district that he 's for a strong bill , and that he does n't have anything to do with any motion to cut the bill down . So when I hear that , I says to myself , ' Lib , where are we at here , anyway ? ' And I think that if they 're gon na get some Republican votes anyway , and if the chairman says he does n't have anything to do with my motion , then certain representations that were made to me is out the window . So I withdraw my motion . "
