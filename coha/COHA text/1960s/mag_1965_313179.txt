After 18 years in the ring and 129 pro fights , Joey Giardello is too much of a pragmatist to rue what might have been . He has , after all , a wife , four children and a $35,000 home in Cherry Hill , N.J. How many fighters can claim that ? But Joey was already an old man of 33 before he got a crack at the world middleweight championship . He was 35 when he lost it at Madison Square Garden last week to the same man he took it away from : Nigeria 's Dick Tiger . That did not really matter either . What did was the fact that Joey 's cut of the $161,964 gate came to $56,050 , making it the biggest payday of his career . <P> It was also his last-as a fighter . In the second round , Tiger ripped a left hook to Joey 's jaw that knocked him halfway across the ring . Twice more , in the seventh and twelfth rounds , Joey was rocked by solid punches to the head . Legs rubbery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face from cuts over both eyes , he stubbornly fought on , even though his cause was hopeless . After 15 rounds , the judges ' verdict was unanimous for Tiger . Giardello had no excuses . " I wanted to show New York a good fight , " he said , and announced that he was retiring . At that , Champion Tiger could only wonder rhetorically : " How can he live if he does not fight ? "
