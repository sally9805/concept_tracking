CHALLENGE TO AFFLUENCE by Gunnar Myrdal. 172 pages . Pantheon. $3.95 . <P> Sometimes it has taken an imaginative outsider to see the U.S. plain . There were De Tocqueville and Lord Bryce , and in this century the Swedish Economist Gunnar Myrdal . <P> Twenty-six years ago , Myrdal was commissioned by the Carnegie Corporation to write a definitive study of the American Negro . Myrdal spent four years researching and writing and produced a masterpiece , An American Dilemma , which destroyed forever the comfortable white notion that separate could be equal . A pivotal book in the history of U.S. race relations , it influenced the Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in the schools . <P> After he had completed his mammoth project , Myrdal went home to teach and write about international economics . This year he came back , took a hard look at America and declared that it had a new dilemma . The greatest problem in the world today , he asserts , is the near-stagnant U.S. economy . <P> " Utter Destitution . " The American people , he writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. has all the production it needs . Americans have become " defeatist " about their own economy and in the last decade have settled for one of the lowest rates of growth in the world , which Myrdal calculates at a meager 1 % , a figure below the estimates of most other economists . Seven percent of the American people live in what Myrdal calls " utter destitution , " e.g. , individuals with an annual income under $1,000 , families with an annual income under $2,000 . <P> If the U.S. is having trouble with its foreign policy , it is largely because of its limping economy , writes Myrdal . The U.S. can not persuade its allies of its policies because of its continuing balance of payments deficit . Some leadership is passing to the creditor nations of Europe-an ominous trend , thinks Myrdal , since he believes that democracy is not so firmly grounded in France , Germany or Italy as it is in the U.S. <P> To get the American economy moving again , Myrdal offers a familiar nostrum : the coordination of greater public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myrdal insists , does not mean more federal controls over the economy . In fact , he feels that there is already far too much federal intervention in the day-to-day working of the American economy . <P> Hands-Off Policy . Too many economists , writes Myrdal , seem mesmerized by the French economy , which is heavily nationalized and regimented . Sweden , he suggests , should be their model instead . Both Swedish workers and employers have voluntarily formed central organizations for collective bargaining . These groups consider the national interest when they make price and wage agreements , and they have prevented the costly strikes that harass the U.S. economy . The Swedish government follows a strict hands-off policy : it has not even had to set a minimum wage . But Myrdal admits that the voluntarism that works for small Sweden , with a population less than New York City 's , may not work for the sprawling U.S. <P> Myrdal is probably too pessimistic for most economists , and his proposals too far to the left for most Americans . <P> But it is refreshing to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about American power in the world . Myrdal wants to see more of it .
