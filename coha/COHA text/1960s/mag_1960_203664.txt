Hundreds of students marched through the streets of Seoul shaking down pedestrians for American cigarettes ( " Our politicians live in luxury-foreign cigarettes will burn the fatherland ! " ) , seizing Japanese records from tearooms ( " Japanese swords are hidden in these melodies ! " ) , and dragging civil servants out of cars bearing blue , official plates ( " Why are you using official transport after office hours ? Who do you think you are-Syngman Rhee or somebody ? " ) . The puritanical demonstrators lit big bonfires of cigarettes and records and then swept through Seoul 's biggest kisang ( geisha ) house , the White Cloud , to drive male customers and indignant , silk-gowned " hostesses " into the street . " Only rotten people visit kisang houses ! " the students cried . <P> Behind the demonstration lay the students ' puzzled anger that their April revolution had brought no immediate , sweeping changes in the national life . Police were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering that students recently beat one defiant pro-Rhee villager to death , were worried about the trend . Said one : " The repressive influence formerly wielded by police is now exercised by the students . "
