FORBIDDEN COLORS by Yukio Mishima , translated from the Japanese by Alfred H. Marks . 403 pages . Knopf. $6.95 . <P> <P> Yukio Mishima , 43 , is clearly out to become Japan 's answer to Papa-san Hemingway . He lifts weights . He excels at kendo , a Japanese swordfighting sport . He makes headlines by producing , directing , and acting in films . And , of course , he writes . How he writes ! Poetry , modern No plays , short stories by the score , and novels ( The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea ) at the rate of nearly one a year . <P> Paralleling Hemingway the artist as well as the public personality , he has become the leading spokesman for his own " lost generation " of the half-Westernized young . How lost is lost ? Pretty desperately far out , as Mishima charts it . In Forbidden Colors , an ugly , aging novelist with a consuming hatred for women makes a devil 's compact with a staggeringly handsome young homosexual named Yuichi . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molded in bronze " will exact the old man 's revenge by systematically attracting and frustrating women-even to the extent of marriage . <P> Witches ' Sabbath . What follows is a leisurely lover 's lesson on the giving and receiving of pain that makes John Updike 's Couples read like a children 's bedtime story . Besides incomparable good looks , Yuichi has the aphrodisiac of complete heartlessness going for him . Other people exist only as narcissistic mirrors in whose admiring eyes he enjoys himself . The old novelist gives him speeches on " the joy of being without feeling . " He hardly needs them . <P> Falling in love with Yuichi is like falling in love with cruelty . But Author Mishima 's world is rich in nothing if not masochists , male as well as female . For while he is at it . Yuichi gives just as bad a time to his gay boy friends , who range up the scale from waiter to automobile manufacturer . <P> <P> In fact , the best scenes are those set in the suffocating , sealed-off community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabbath . Here , in the gay parks and bars frequented by people in " the van of decadence , " is modern hell for sure . And Yuichi-make no mistake-is Mishima 's modern damned man : he who kills everybody and everything he touches by a kind of pathological indifference . He is a soul capable of being neither corrupted nor redeemed because he really wants nothing , nothing at all . <P> Over the Shoulders . At times , Mishima 's single-pattern plot seems to glide in slow , repetitive cycles , freezing faces in glaring expressions like kabuki actors : frenzied passion , cross-eyed frustration . Still , what keeps the novel from being another existentialist dead end is the presence of the author . It is finally not the hang-ups of his characters but the questions Mishima asks about them that fascinate-including the ultimate , curiously Japanese question that his novel tests for itself : Can obsession with death , pushed to an extreme , result in some absolute awareness of life ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
