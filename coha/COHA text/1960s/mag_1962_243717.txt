Over the past six months , before the 17-nation Disarmament Conference in Geneva , the West has argued that any agreement to halt nuclear weapons tests must include adequate provisions for inspection to ensure that neither side is cheating . Russia , which claims that inspection would amount to legalized espionage , has clung just as doggedly to its demand for an unpoliced moratorium , similar to the 34-month " gentleman 's agreement " that was shattered by Soviet tests last fall . <P> Last week the West made its most determined effort yet to come to terms with the Soviet Union . The U.S. and Britain dramatically offered Nikita Khrushchev his choice of two draft treaties . It was , in effect , a Hobson 's choice , since Russia has repeatedly rejected the first of the two proposals , which envisages a system of inspection and control . The West 's second , more radical draft represents a major concession . It calls for a halt to testing in the atmosphere , space and under water-and contains no policing provisions-but underground tests would be permitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waive on-site inspection is backed by improved monitoring techniques that can now identify and pinpoint most types of explosion from outside Russia 's borders . However , scientists are not yet positive that they can always distinguish some underground tests from earthquake shocks ; hence , the U.S. decision against banning subterranean tests until it has the foolproof detection devices to make the ban stick . <P> Pooh-poohing the West 's eagerness to end atmospheric pollution as " playing upon the emotions of simple people , " Soviet Delegate Vasily Kuznetsov rejected the new proposal . Nonetheless . Kuznetsov hinted that it might be acceptable to Russia provided it included a " firm understanding " that all underground tests be halted pending a " permanent solution . " He also dangled an unexpected specific : he suggested Jan. 1 as a starting date , indicating that the present Soviet test series will be over by then . <P> Encouraged , the U.S. and Britain refused to take Russia 's nyet for a final answer , urged that the conference subcommittee stay in session instead of recessing this week , in hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue is scheduled to return to the U.N . General Assembly . <P> The West argues that without some workable formula for ending tests , there is no hope of restricting the spread of nuclear weapons . Next nation expected to join the nuclear club is Communist China . <P> A U.S. Disarmament Agency spokesman last week blurted that China 's bang was coming " within a matter of months , " though later his estimate was amended to " about a year or two . " In any event , Peking has the skilled scientists and the reactors to produce a crude atomic device , though it would still take China years to develop a stockpile of nuclear weapons . <P> Built-in Temptation . Meanwhile , if the West intended its new offer to be rejected by Russia while winning ; plaudits from neutral nations at the conference , it was a waste of effort . Encouraged by the West 's concessions , neutral delegates-who know better than to pressure Russia merely tried to cajole Britain and the U.S. into banning underground tests as well , which they flatly refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
