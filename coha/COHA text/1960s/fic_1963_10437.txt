40 however , asks humbly if my Holiness has need of anything . Then he kneels and begs my blessing on himself and his family . Embarrassed , he ventures to suggest that if I am not too tired , I may deign to show myself again to the people who still wait in St. Peter 's square . They acclaimed me this morning when I was led out to give my first blessing to the city and to the world . Yet so long as my light burns , it seems there will always be sonic waiting for God knows what sign of power or benignityfrom the papal bedroom . How can I tell them that they must never expect too much from a middle-aged fellow in striped cotton pajamas ? But tonight is different . There is a whole concourse of Romans and of tourists in the Piazza , and it would be a courtesy  --  excuse me , Holiness , a great condescension !  --  to appear with one small blessing .... I condescend , and I am exalted once again on wave after wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Father , and they urge me to live a long time . I bless them and hold out my arms to them , and they clamor again , and I am caught in a strange heart-stopping moment , when it seems that my arms encompass the world and that it is much too heavy for me to hold . Then my valet  --  or is it my jailer ?  --  draws me back , closes the window , and draws the drapes , so that , officially at least , His Holiness Kiril I is in bed and asleep . The valet 's name is Gelasio , which is also the name of a Pope . He is a good fellow , and I am glad of a minute of his company . We talk a few moments , and then he asks me , blushing and stammering , about my name . He is the first who has dared to raise the question except old Rinaldi , who , when I announced that I desired to keep my baptismal name , nodded and smiled ironically and said , 41 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for God 's sake , do n't let them turn it into Italian . " I took his advice , and I explained to the Cardinals as I now explain to my valet that I kept the name because it belonged to the Apostle of the Slays , who was said to have invented the modern Cyrillic alphabet and who was a stubborn defender of the right of people to keep the Faith in their own idiom . I explained to them also that I should prefer to have my name used in its Slavic form , for a testimony to the universality of the Church . Not all of them approve since they are quick to see how a man 's first act sets the pattern of his later ones . No one objected , however , except Leone , he who runs the Holy Office and has the reputation of a modern St. Jerome , whether for his love of tradition , a Spartan life , or a notoriously crusty temper I have yet to find out . Leone asked pointedly whether a Slavic name might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encyclicals . Although he is the one who first proclaimed me in the conclave , I had to tell him gently that I was more interested in having my encyclicals read by the people than in coddling the Latinists , and that since Russian had become a canonical language for the Marxist world , it would not hurt us to have the tip of one shoe in the other camp . He took the reproof well , but I do not think he will easily forget it . Men who serve God professionally are apt to regard Him as a private preserve . Some of them would like to make His Vicar a private preserve as well . I do not say that Leone is one of these , but I have to be careful . I shall have to work differently from any of my predecessors , and I can not submit myself to the dictate of any man , however high he stands , or however good he may be. 42 None of this , of course , is for my valet , who will take hocnc only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man on the strength of a Pontiff 's confi-d ' nce .

" I must , as soon as I can , do something about the Osservatore . . .. I f my voice is to be heard in the world , it must be heard in its authentic tones . Already I know there are questions about my beard . I have heard murmurs of a " too Byzantine look . " The Latins are more sensitive about such customs than we are , so perhaps it might have been a courtesy to explain that my jaw was broken under questioning and that without a beard I am somewhat disfigured . . . . It is so small a matter , and yet schisms have begun over smaller ones . I wonder what Kamenev said when he heard the news of my election .

IIIN THE white marble lounge of the Foreign Press Club , George Faber stretched his elegant legs and delivered his verdict on the election : " To the East a stumbling block , to the West a foolishness , to the Romans a disaster . " A respectful laugh fluttered around the room . A man who had spent so many years on the Vatican beat had a right to make phrases  --  even bad ones . Sure of the attention of his audience , he talked on in his calm , confident voice : " Look at it any way you like , Kiril I means a political mess . He 's been a prisoner of the Russians for seventeen years , so at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Soviets . Americais involved , too . I think we can expect progressive abandonment of neutralist policies and a gradual lining up of the Vatican with the West . We are back again to the Pacelli-Spellman alliance . For Italy  --  " He flung out eloquent hands that embraced the whole peninsula . " Bell ! What happens now to the Italian miracle of recovery ? It was created in co-operation with the Vatican  --  44 Vatican money , Vatican prestige abroad , Vatican help in eiiuigi ation , the confessional authority of the clergy hold- ing the Left in check . What happens now ? If he starts making new appointments , the links between the Vatican and the Republic can be broken very quickly . The deli- sate balance can be tipped . " He relaxed again and turned on his colleagues a smile of charm and deprecation , the smile of kingmaker . " At least that 's my story and I 'm sticking to it . You may quote me with acknowledgments , and if anyone steals my lead lines I 'll sue ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back to the bar with a German from Bonn . " Faber is a mountebank , of course , but he does have a point on the Italian situation . I 'm quite staggered by this election . From all I hear , most of the Italians were in fa- vor of it  --  though none of them gave any hint of it before they went into conclave . It 's a wonderful weapon for Right or Left . The moment the Pope talks about any Ital- ian business they can label him a foreigner , interfering in local politics . . . . That 's what happened to the Dutch- man  --  who was it , Adrian VI ? The historical evidence shows him a wise man and a sound administrator , but when he died the Church was in a bigger mess than be- fore . I 've never liked the kind of baroque Catholicism which the Italians hand out to the world , but in affairs of state they have a great political value  --  like the Irish , if you understand what I mean .

" She gave a highpitchedbraying laugh . " There 's a mystery about it , " said Boucher , the foxfacedFrenchman . " A complete outsider after the shortest conclave in history ! I talked with Morand and with some of our own people . The impression was of desperation  --  as if they saw the end of the world and wanted someone special to lead us toward it . They could be right . The Chinese have gone to Moscow , and the word is that they want a war now or they will split the Marxist world down the middle .

" Feuchtwanger theSwiss sipped a coffee and talked in a whisper with Eriksonthe Swede . " A courier arrived in Rome yesterday from Moscow , by way of Prague and Warsaw . This morninga personage from the Russian Embassy called on CardinalPotocki . Of course , nobody is saying anything , but I wonder if Russia expects something from this man . Kamenevis in trouble with the Chinese , and he has always seen a lot farther than the end of his nose .... " " Strange , " said Fedorov the Tass man softly , " strange ! Wherever you turn today , you feel the finger of Kamenev , even in this  --  name him or not , you see his touch . " Beron the Czech nodded wisely , but said nothing . The great Kamenev was beyond the reach of his humble pen , and after twenty years of survival he had learned that it was better to say nothing for a year than to permit himself a moment 's indiscretion . The Russian talked on with the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rumor  --  it was only a rumorthen  --  that Kamenev had organized this man 's escape , and that the Praesidium would have his head for it . Now although we have been told to say nothing , the secretis out . It was Kamenev . And he must be laughing in Iris sleeve to see a man on whom he has left his mark sitting ; on the apostolic throne . " " And what does the Praesidium think of it ? " asked the Czech cautiously . F'edorov shrugged and spread his stubby fingers on the table . " They approve , of course  --  why should they not ? Kamenev 's mark is on every one of them , too . Besides , the man is a genius . Who else could have done what all the Five-Year Plans could not do  --  bring the Siberian plains into flower ? From the Baltic to Bulgaria , look what he has done ! For the first time , we have peace in the Western marches . Even the Poles do n't hate us too much any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , whatever this man does the Praesidium and the people can not fail to approve . " The Czech nodded soberly , and then asked another question . " This , this mark of Kamenev  --  what is it ? " The Tass man sipped his drink thoughtfully , and then said , " He spoke about it once , I believe . I was not there , but I heard echoes of it . He said , Once you have taken a man to pieces under questioning , once you have laid out the bits on the table and put them together again , then a strange thing happens . Either you love him or you hate him for the rest of your life . He will either love you or hate you in return . You can not lead a man or a people through hell without wishing to share a heaven with them , tool ' That 's why our own people love him . He put them on the rack for three years and then suddenly showed them a new world . " He downed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " A great man , the greatest we have had since Peter the Emperor ! " " And this Pope  --  this Kiril  --  what sort of a man will he be ? " " I do n't know , " said the Russian thoughtfully . " If Kamenevloves him , strange things may happen . Strange things may happen to both of them . " He was not yet crowned , but already Kiril the Pope had felt the impact of power . The shock of it was greater than he had ever dreamed . Two thousand years of time and all of eternity were now given into his hands . Five hundred million people were his subjects , and his tribute came in every coinage of the world . He could walk , as he walked each day now in the gardens of the Vatican , and measure the confines of his kingdom in a day 's stroll ; yet this narrowdomain was only a foothold from which his power reached out to encompass the tilted planet . The men who had made him he could now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they delivered to him with the Keys he could dispense at will or dissipate with a fool 's gesture . His bureaucracy was more complex and yet more cheaply run than any other in the world . The toy soldiers who guarded his sacred presence were backed by thousands of levies bound to him by vow to serve with their talent , their hearts , their will , and all their celibate lives . Other men held dominion by the fickle voice of voters , by the pressure of party alignment , or by the tyranny of military juntas . He alone in all the world held it by divine delegation , and no one of all his subjects dared gainsay it . Yet the knowledge of power was one thing , the use of it 48 was quite another . Whatever his plans for the Church , whatever changes he might make in the future , he had for the present to use the instruments at his disposal and the organization which his predecessors had transmitted to him . Ile had to learn so much so quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if there were a conspiracy to rob him of the time to think or plan . There were moments when he felt like a puppet being dressed and rehearsed for the theatre . The cobblers came to measure him for new slippers , the tailors to stitch his white cassocks . The jewelers offered their designs for his ring and his pectoral cross . The heraldspresented their drawings for his coat of arms : crossed keys for Peter 's charge , a bear rampant on a white field , above it the dove of the Paraclete , and beneath , the motto " Ex oriente lux . . . . A light out of the East . " Ile approved it at first glance . It appealed to his imaginationand to his sense of humor . It took time to lick a bear into shape  --  but once he was full-grown he was a very formidable fellow . With the Holy Ghost to guide him , he might hope to do much for the Church . And perhaps the East had been dark too long because the West had given too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led him through audience after audience  --  withthe press , with the diplomatic corps , with the noble families who claimed place about the papal throne , with prefects and secretaries of congregations and tribunalsand commissions . The Chancellery of Briefs and the Secretariat of Briefs to Princes kept his desk piled with replies in impeccable Latin to all the letters and telegrams of felicitation . The Secretariat of State reminded him 49 daily of crisis and revolution and the intrigues of the embassies . At every step he stubbed his pontifical toe on history , ritual , and protocol , and the cumbersome methodology of Vatican bureaucracy . Wherever he turned , there was an official at his elbow , directing His Holiness ' attention to this or that  --  an office to be filled , a courtesy to be bestowed , or talent to be elevated . The setting was grandiose , the stage management was sedulous , but it took him nearly a week to find out the title of the play . It was an old Roman comedy , once popular , but now fallen into some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The theme was simple  --  how to give a man absolute power and then to limit his use of it . The technique was to make him feel so important and to keep him so busy with pompous trifles that he had no time to think out a policy or put it into execution . When he saw the joke , Kiril the Ukrainian laughed privatelyand decided to make a joke of his own . So two days before his coronation he summoned without warning a private meeting of all the Cardinals in the Borgia rooms of the Vatican . The abruptness of the call was calculated , and the risk of it was calculated , too . The day after his coronation all but the Cardinals of the Curia would leave Rome and return to their own countries . Each could prove a willing adjutant or a discreethindrance to papal policy . One did not become a Prince of the Church without some ambition and some taste for power . One did not grow old in office without some hardening of heart and will . They were more than subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own apostolic succession and of the autonomyconferred by it . Even a Pope must deal delicately with tll ( '  - -  -  and not strain too far their wisdom , their loyalty , or their national pride . When Kiril saw them seated before him , old and wise and shrewdly expectant , his heart sank and he asked him- sell for the hundredth time what he had to offer to them and to the Church . Then once again it seemed as though power renewed itself in him , and he made the Sign of the Cross , an invocation to the Holy Ghost , and then plunged into the business of the Consistory . He did not use the " we " of authority , but spoke intimately and person- ally , as if anxious to establish a relation of friendship : " My brothers , my helpers in the cause of Christ . . . " His voice was strong , yet strangely tender , as if he pleaded with them for fraternity and understanding . " What I am today you have made me . Yet if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but God who has set me in these shoes of the Fisherman . Day and night I have asked myself what I have to offer to Him or to His Church  --  I have so little , you see . I am a man who was wrenched out of life like Laza- rus , and then drawn back into it by the hand of God . All of you are men of your time . You have grown with it , you have been changed by it , you have contributed to change it for better or for worse . It is natural that each of you should guard jealously that place and that knowl- edge , and that authority which you have earned for your- selves in time . Now , however , I must ask you to be gen- erous with me and lend me what you have of knowledge and experience in the name of God . " His voice faltered a little , and to the old men it seemed for a moment as if he were about to weep . Then he recovered himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a stronger tone . " Unlike you , I am not a man of my time  --  because I have spent seventeen years in prison and time has passed me by . So much of the world is a novelty to me . The only thing that is not new is man , and him I know and love because I have lived with him for so long in the simple intimacy of survival . Even the Church is strange to me because I have had to dispense for so long with what is unnecessary in it , and I have had to cling the more desperately to that which is of its nature and its essencetheDeposit of Faith , the Sacrifice , and the sacramental acts . " For the first time , he smiled at them , sensing their uneasinessand trying to calm them . " I know the thought that is in your mind  --  that you may have for Pope an innovator , a man avid for change . This is not so . Though much change is necessary , we must make it together . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and help me . I can not cling as zealously as some to ritual and to traditional forms of devotion because for years I have held to nothing but the simplest forms of prayer and the bare essentials of the Sacraments . I know , believe me , I know , that there are those for whom the straightest road is the safest one . I wish them to be as free as possible inside the bond of the Faith . I do not wish to change the long tradition of a celibate clergy . I myself am celibate as you are . Yet I have seen the Faith preserved under persecution by married priests who have handed it to their children like a jewel in silk . I can not grow hot over the legalities of the canonists or the rivalriesof religious congregations because I have seen women raped by their jailers , and I have delivered their children with these consecrated hands . " Once again he smiled and threw out his crooked hands to them in a gesture of pleading . " I am perhaps the wrongmain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you undl von must make the best of me . " There was a long pause , and then he went on more strongly still , not pleading , not explaining , but demand- ing with all the power that surged within him : " You ask me where I want to lead you , where I want to had the Church . I will show you . I want to lead you back to God , through men . Understand this , understand it in mind and heart and obedient will . We are what we are , for the service of God through the service of man . If we lose contact with man  --  suffering , sinful , lost , con- fused men crying in the night , women agonizing , chil- dren weeping  --  then we , too , are lost because we shall be negligent shepherds who have done everything but the one thing necessary . " He paused and stood facing them , tall , pale , and strange , with his scarred face , and his crooked hands , and his black Byzantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal Latin question : " Quid vobis videtur . . . . How does it seem to you ? " There was a ritual to cover this moment , just as there was a ritual to cover every act of Vatican life . The Cardi- nals would remove their red caps and bow their heads in submission , and then wait to be dismissed to do or not to do that which they had been counselled . A papal allo- cution was rarely a dialogue , but this time there was a sense of urgency and even of conflict in the assembly . Cardinal Leone heaved his lion 's bulk out of his chair , tossed his white mane , and addressed himself to the Pon- tiff . " All of us here have pledged to your Holiness and to the Church the service of our lives . Yet we should not dis- charge this service if we did not offer counsel when we believed counsel was necessary . " " This is what I have asked of you , " said Kiril mildly . " Please speak freely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is too early yet to measure the effect of your Holiness ' election upon the world at large , and especiallyupon the Roman and Italian Church . I mean no disrespect when I say that until we know this reaction there should be a prudence , a reserve in public utterance and public action . " " I have no quarrel with that , " said Kiril in the same mild fashion . " But you must not quarrel with me when I tell you that I want the voice of Kiril to be heard by all men  --  not another voice , in another accent or another mode , but my voice . A father does not speak to his son through an actor 's mask . He speaks simply , freely , and from the heart , and this is what I propose to do . " The old lion held his ground and went on stubbornly . " There are realities to be faced , Holiness . The voice will change , no matter what you do . It will issue from the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pacific . It will be interpreted by a hostile press or a theatrical television correspondent . The most your Holiness can expect is that the first voice shall be yours and the first record shall be the authentic one . " He permitted himself a grim smile . " We , too , are your voices , Holiness , and even we may find it hard to render the score perfectly . " He sat down amid a small rustle of approval . Then Pallenberg , the lean , cold man from Germany , took the floor and presented his own problem . " Your Holinesshas spoken of changes . It is my view and the view of my brother bishops that certain changes are long over- 54 clue . We are a divided country . We have an immense prosperity and a dubious future . There is a drift of the ( : athulic population away from the Church because our woiimen must marry outside it , since our males were decimatedduring the war . Our problems in this regard are legion . We can solve them only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being dealt with by Monsignori who can not even speak our language , who work solely by the canons , and who have no sense of our history or of our present problems . They delay , they temporize , they centralize . They treat the affairs of souls as if they were entriesin a ledger . Our burden is great enough , we can not carry Rome on our backs as well  --  for myself and for my brethren , Appello ad Petrum . . . . I appeal to Peter ! " There was an audible gasp at so much bluntness . Leone flushed angrily , and Rinaldi hid a smile behind a silk handkerchief . After a moment Kiril the Pope spoke again . His tone was as mild as ever , but this time they noticed he used the plural of royalty . " We promise our German brothers that we shall give immediate and full consideration to their special problems and we shall confer with them privatelybefore they return to their homeland . We would urge them , however , to patience and to charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , that often things are left undone from habit and from traditionrather than from lack of good will . " He paused a mornent , letting the reproof sink in ; then he chuckled . " I have had my own troubles with another bureaucracy . Even the men who tormented me did not lack good will . They wanted to build a new world in one generation , but the bureaucracy beat them each time . Let us see if we can find ourselves more priests and fewer bureaucrats 55  --  fewer clerks and more simple souls who understand the human heart . " Now it was the turn of the Frenchman , and he was no less blunt than Pallenberg . " Whatever we do in France  --  whatever we propose from France  --  comes here to Rome under the shadow of old history . Every one of our projects , from the worker priests to studies in the development of dogma and the creation of an intelligent Catholic press , is greeted as if it were a new tramontane rebellion . We can not work freely or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves helped by the fraternity of the Church if a cloud of censure hangs over everything we plan or propose . " He swung around angrily and flung out a challenge to the Italians . " There are heresies here in Rome , too , and this is one of them : that unity and uniformityare the same thing , that the Roman way is best for everyone from Hong Kong to Peru . Your Holiness has expressed the wish to have his voice heard in its true tone . We , too , wish to have our voice heard without distortion at the throne of Peter . Appointments need to be made , men who can represent us and the climate in which we live , truthfully and with understanding . " " You touch on a problem , " said Kiril carefully , " which preoccupies us as well . We ourselves carry the burden of history so that we can not always deal with the simplicity of a matter , but must consider a complexity of colorations and historic associations . " He raised a hand to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a source of scandal to some , although our Master and the first Apostleswere all bearded men . I should hate to think that the rock of Peter should split for want of a razor . Quid vobis videtur ? " In that moment they laughed and loved him . Their56anger with one another subsided , and they listened more humbly while the men from the South Americas told of their own problems : impoverished populations , a scarcityof trained clergy , the historic association of the Church with the wealthy and the exploiters , lack of funds , the strength of the Marxist idea held up like a torch to rally the dispossessed . Came then the men from the East , telling how the frontiers were closing one by one on the Christian idea . And how one by one the old missionary foundations were being destroyed while the idea of an earthly paradise took hold of the minds of men who needed it so desperatelybecause they had so little time to enjoy it . It was a brutal balance sheet for men who had to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a silence over the whole assembly , and they waited for Kiril the Pontiff to make his final summation . He rose then in his place and confronted them  --  a figure oddly young , oddly alone , like a Christ from a Byzantinetriptych . " There are those , " he told them solemnly , " who believe that we are come to the last age of the world because man has now the power to destroy himself from the face of the earth , and every day the danger grows greater that he will do it . Yet we , my brothers , have no more and no less to offer for the world 's salvation than we had in the beginning . We preach Christ and Him crucified  --  tothe Jews , indeed a stumbling block ; and to the Gentiles , foolishness . This is the folly of the Faith , and if we are not committed to it , then we are committed to an illusion . What do we do , therefore ? From this point where do we go ? I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a lamp and we walk out like the first Apostlesto tell the good tidings to whoever will listen . If his- 57 tory stands in our way , we ignore it . If systems inhibit us , we dispense with them . If dignities weigh us down , we cast them aside . I have one commission now for all of you  --  for those who are going away from Rome and those who stay here in the shadow of our triumphs and our sins  --  find me men ! Find me good men who understand what it is to love God and love His children . Find me men with fire in their hearts and wings on their feet . Send them to me , and I will send them out to bring love to the loveless and hope to those who sit in darkness ... . Go now in the name of God !

To his surprise , it was answered within an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the papal apartment , he found the new Pontiff alone , sitting in an armchair , reading a small volume bound in faded leather .

The cooking is bad , and I have n't had time to reform the papal kitchens . I hope your company will give me a better dinner than usual . " He pointed to the yellowed pages of the book and chuckled . " Our friend Rinaldi has a sense of humor . He gave me a present to celebrate my election . It is an account of the reign of the Dutchman , Adrian VI . Do you know what they called the Cardinals who elected him ? Betrayers of Christ 's blood , who surrendered the fair Vatican to foreign fury , and handed the Church and Italy into slavery with the barbarians .

" Potocki was touched by the charm of his new Master , but the habit of caution was strong in him and he con- tented himself with a formality . " A letter was delivered to me this morning , Holiness . I am told that it comes from Moscow . I was asked to deliver it directly into your hands . " He brought out a bulky envelope sealed with gray wax and handed it to Kiril , who held it a moment in his hands and then laid it on the table . " I shall read it later , and if it should concern you as well , I shall call you . Now tell me . . . " He leaned forward in his chair , begging earnestly for a confidence .

He said softly , " We have both been in prison , you and I. We both know that when they tried to break us it was not with the love we had , but with the resentments that we had buried deep inside us . When you sat in the darkness , trembling and waiting for the next session with the lights , and the pain , and the questions , what tempted you most ?

" " Vhat we do in Warsaw , " said Potocki , " is not always understood in Rome . " " If you need an interpreter , " said Kiril briskly , " send me one . I promise him always a ready hearing . " " There will be so many , Holiness , and they will speak in so many tongues . How can you attend to them all ? " " I know . " Kiril 's thin frame seemed suddenly to shrink , as if under a burden . " Strange . We profess and we teach that the Pontiff is preserved from fundamental error by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit . I pray , but I hear no thunder on the mountain . My eyes see no splendors on the hills . I stand between God and man , but I hear only man and the voice of my heart . " For the first time , the harsh face of the Pole relaxed , and he spread his hands in a gesture of willing defeat . " Listen to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heart , and this may well be God 's dialogue with men . " " Let 's go to dinner , " said Kiril the Pontiff , " and forgive my nuns their heavy hand with the sauce . They are worthy creatures , but I will have to find them a good cook-book . " They ate no better than he had promised , and they drank a thin young wine from the Alban Hills ; but they talked more freely , and a warmth grew between them , and when they came to the fruit and the cheese Kiril the Pontiff opened his heart on another matter . " In two days I am to be crowned . It is a small thing , perhaps , but I am troubled by so much ceremony . The Master came into Jerusalem riding on a donkey . I am to be carried on the shoulders of nobles between the plumed 61 fans of a Roman emperor . All over the world are barefoot men with empty bellies . I am to be crowned with gold , and my triumph will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the successor of the Carpenter should be treated like a king . I should like to change it . " Potocki gave a thin smile and shook his head . " They will not let you do it , Holiness . " " I know . " Kiril 's fingers toyed with the broken crumbs on his plate . " I belong to the Romans , too , and they must have their holiday . I can not walk down the nave of St. Peter 's because I could not be seen , and even if the visitorsdo not come to pray they do come to see the Pontiff . I am a prince by treaty , they remind me , and a prince must wear a crown . " " Wear it , Holiness , " said Potocki with grim humor . " Wear it for the day , and do not trouble yourself . Soon enough they crown you with thorns ! " An hour away at his villa in the Alban Hills , Valerio Cardinal Rinaldi was giving his own dinner party . His guests made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skill of a man who had just proved himself a kingmaker . Leone was there , and Semmering , the Father General of the Jesuits , whom the vulgar called " the Black Pope . " There were Goldoni , from the Secretariat of State , and Benedetti , the prince of Vatican finances , and Orlando Campeggio , the shrewd , swarthy fellow who was the editorof the Osservatore Romano . At the foot of the table , as if for a concession to the mystics , sat Rahamani the Syrian , soft , complaisant , and always unexpected . The meal was served on a belvedere which looked down on a classic garden , once the site of an Orphic temple , 62 and beyond it to the farmlands and the distant glow of Rome . The air was mild , the night was full of stars , and liinaldi 's assiduous servants had coaxed them into comfort with one another. ( . unpeggio , the layman , smoked his cigar and talked freely , a prince among the princes . " . . . First it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . I have thought a great deal about this , and you will all have read what we have already done in the press . The theme so far has been in prison for the Faith . ' The reaction to this has been good  --  a wave of sympathy  --  an expression of lively affection and loyalty . Of course , this is only the beginning , and it does not solve all our problems . Our next thought was to present a Pope of the people . ' We may need some assistance with this , particularly from an Italian point of view . Fortunately , he speaks good Italian and therefore can communicate himself in publicfunctions , and in contacts with the populace ... . Ilere we shall need both direction and assistance from the members of the Curia . . . . " He was a deft man , and he broke off at this point , leaving the proposition for the clerics . It was Leone who took it up , worrying it in his stubborn fashion , while he peeled an apple and sliced it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it sounds . We have to present him , yes , but we have to edit him and comment him as well . You heard what went on in the Consistory today . " He thrust the knife blade at Rinaldi and Rahamani . " Print what he said baldly and without explanation , and it would read as if he were ready to throw two thousand years of tradition out the window . I saw his point , we all did , but I saw , too , where we have to protect him . " 63 " Where is that ? " Semmering , the spare blond Jesuit , leaned forward in his place . " He showed us his own Achilles ' heel , " said Leone firmly . " He said he was a man who had dropped out of time . He will need , I think , to be reminded constantly what our times are and what instruments we have to work with . " " Do you think he is unaware of them ? " asked the Jesuit again . Leone frowned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to read his mind . All I know is that he is asking for something new before he has had time to examine what is old and permanent in the Church . " " As I remember , " said the Syrian mildly , " he asked us to find him men . This is not new . Men are the foundation of every apostolic work . How did he say it ? Men with fire in their hearts and wings on their feet . ' " " We have forty thousand men , " said the Jesuit dryly , " and they are all bound to him by solemn vows of service . We stand , all of us , at his call . " " Not all of us , " said Rinaldi without rancor . " And we should be honest enough to confess it . We move familiarly where he must move for a while awkwardly and strangely , in the headquarters of the Church . We accept the inertia and the ambition , and the bureaucracy , because we have been bred to it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he said to me yesterday ? " He paused like an actor , waiting for their attention to focus on him . " He said , I celebrated Mass once in seventeen years . I lived where hundreds of millions will die without having seen a priest or heard the word of God , yet here I see hundreds of priests stamping documents and punching time clocks like common clerks . . . . ' I understand his point of view . " " What does he expect us to do ? " asked Benedetti acidly . " Run the Vatican with IBM machines and put all the priests in the mission fields ? No man can be as naive as that . " " I do n't think he is naive , " said Leone . " Far from it . But I think he may discount too readily what Rome means to the Church  --  for order and discipline , and a stewardship of the Faith . " For the first time , Goldoni , the gray , stocky man from the Secretariat of State , entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fire as he gave his own version of the new Pontiff . " He has been in to see me several times . He does not summon me , but walks in qui- etly and asks questions of me and of my staff . I have the impression that he understands politics very well , espe- dally Marxist politics , but he is little interested in details and personalities . He uses one word often , pressure . He asks where the pressures begin in each country , and how they act on the people , and on those who rule them . When I asked him to explain , he said that the Faith was planted in men by God , but that the Church had to be built on the human and material resource of each coun- try , and that to survive it had to withstand the pressures that were suffered by the mass of the people . He said something else , too : that we have centralized too much , and we have delayed too long to train those who can maintain the universality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spoke of vacuums created by Rome  --  vacuums in classes and countries  --  and local cler- gies . . . . I do not know how enlightened his own poli- des may be , but he is not blind to the defects of those which already exist . " " The new broom , " said Benedetti tartly . " He wants tosweep all the rooms at once . . . . He can read a balance sheet , too ! He objects that we have so much in credit while there is so much poverty in Uruguay , or among the Urdus . I ask myself if he really understands that forty years ago the Vatican was almost bankrupt and Gasparrihad to borrow ten thousand sterling pounds to finance the papal election . Now at least we can pay our way and move with some strength for the good of the Church . " " When he spoke to us , " said Rahamani again , " I did not hear him mention money . I was reminded how the first Apostles were sent out with neither scrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the story , that is how our Kiril came from Siberia to Rome . " " Possibly , " said Benedetti irritably . " But have you ever looked at the travel bills for a pair of missionaries  --  or worked out how much it costs to train a seminary teacher ? " Abruptly Leone threw back his white mane and laughed , so that the night birds stirred in the cypresses and the echoes rolled down over the starlit valley . " That 's it . We elected him in the name of God , and now suddenlywe 're afraid of him . He has made no threat , he has changed no appointment , he has asked nothing but what we profess to offer . Yet here we sit , weighing him like conspirators and making ready to fight him . What has he done to us ? " " Perhaps he has read us better than we like , " said Semmering the Jesuit . " Perhaps , " said Valerio Rinaldi , " perhaps he trusts us more than we deserve .... " Extract fromthe Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max . ... It is late and the moon is climbing high . The Square of St. Peter is empty , but the rumor of the city still reaches me on the night wind  --  footsteps sounding hollow on stones , a scream of motor tires , the bleat of a horn , snatches of faraway song , and the slow clip-clop of a tired horse . I am wakeful tonight , and I resent my solitude . I want to walk out through the Angelic Gate and find my people where they stroll or sit together in the alleys of Trastevere , or huddle in narrow rooms with their fears and their loves . I need them so much more than they need me . One day soon I must do this . I must shrug off the bonds which are laid upon me by protocol and precaution and confront this city of mine so that I may see it and it may see me as we truly are . . . . I remember the stories of my childhood , how the CaliphHaroun disguised himself and walked out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I remember how Jesus the Master sat at meat with tax-gatherers and public women , and I wonder why His successors were so eager to assume the penalty of princes , which is to rule from a secret room and to display oneself like a demi-God only on occasions of public festivity ... . It has been a long day , but I have learned something of myself and of others , too . I made a mistake , I think , in the Consistory . When men are old and powerful , they need to be drawn by reason and calculation because the sap of the heart dries up with age ... . When one is in a position of power , one must not show oneself publicly humble because the ruler must reassure with strength and a show of decision . If one displays one 's heart , it must be in private , so that the man who sees it will believe that he has received a confidence . . . . I am writing like a cynic , and I am ashamed of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were determined to bend me to their opinions ... . Leone was the one who irritated me most of all . I had hoped for an ally , and instead I found a critic . I am tempted to appoint him to another office and remove him from the position of influence which he now holds . Yet this , I think , would be a mistake , and the beginning of greater ones . If I surround myself with weak and compliantmen , I shall rob the Church of noble servants ... and in the end I shall be left without counsellors . Leone is a formidable fellow , and I think we shall find ourselves opposed to each other on many issues . But I do not see him as an intriguer . I should like to have him for my friend because I am a man who needs friendship , yet I do not think he will surrender himself so far . .. . 68 I should like to keep Rinaldi by me , but I think I must consent to his retirement . He is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a subtle and an able one . I sense that he has come to grips with God very late in his life and that he needs a freedom to audit the accounts of his soul . This , fundamentally , is why I am here , to show men the staircase to union with God . If anyone stumbles on my account , then I shall be the one to answer for it . .. . Kamenev 's letter is open before me , and beside it is his gift for my coronation  --  a few grains of Russian soil and a package of sunflower seeds . " I do not know , " he writes , " whether the seeds will grow in Rome , but perhaps if you mix a little Russian earth with them they will bloom for next summer . I remember that I asked you during one interrogation what you missed most of all , and you smiled and said the sunflowersin the Ukraine . I hated you at that moment because I was missing them , too , and we were both exiles in the frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am the first man in Russia . " Do you regret us ? I wonder . I should like to think so because I regret you . We could have done great things together , you and I ; but you were wedded to this wild dream of the hereafter , while I believed , as I still believe , that the best a man can do is make barren earth fruitful and ignorant men wise , and see the children of puny fathers grow tall and straight among the sunflowers . " It would , I suppose , be courteous to congratulate you on your election . For what they are worth , you have my compliments . I am curious to know what this office will do to you . I let you go because I could not change you , and yet I could not bring myself to degrade you any more . It 69 would shame me now if you were to be corrupted by eminence . " We may yet have need of each other , you and I. You have not seen the half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought this country to a prosperity she has not known in all her centuries . Yet we are ringed with swords . The Americans are afraid of us ; the Chinese resent us and want to drag us fifty years back in history . We have fanatics inside our own borders who are not content with bread and peace and work for all , but want to turn us all back into bearded mystics from Dostoievski . " To you perhaps I am anti-Christ . What I believe you reject utterly . But for the present , I am Russia , and I am the guardian of this people . You have weapons in your hands , and I know , though I dare not admit it publicly , how strong they are . I can only hope you will not turn them against your homeland nor pledge them to a base alliance in East or West . " When the seeds begin to grow , remember Mother Russia , and remember that you owe me a life . When the time comes to claim payment , I shall send you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells you , but deal with no others , now or later . Unlike you , I do not have the Holy Ghost to protect me , and I must still be wary of my friends . I wish I could say that you were one . Greetings . Kamenev . " ... I have read the letter a dozen times , and I can not decide whether it brings me to the fringe of a revelation or to the edge of a precipice . I know Kamenev as intimatelyas he knows me , yet I have not reached down to the core of his soul . I know the ambition that drives him , his fanatic desire to exact some goodness from life to pay 70 for the debasement he inflicted on himself and others for SO many years . . . . I have seen peasants scoop up a handful of soil from a new plot and taste it to see whether it was sweet or sour . I can imagine Kamenev doing the same with the soil of Iiiissia . I know how the ghosts of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten me , too . I do not see him as anti-Christ , nor even as an archheretic . Ile has understood and accepted the Marxist dogma as the swiftest and sharpest instrument yet devised to triggera social revolution . I think he would throw it aside the moment he saw it fail of its purpose . I think , though I can not be sure , that he is asking my help to preserve what he has already won of good for the people , and to give it a chance to grow peacefully into other mutations . I believe that having thrust himself up so high , he has begun to breathe a freer air and to wish the same fortune for a people he has learned to love . If this be true , then I must help him ... . Yet there are events which give him the lie at every moment . There are invasions and forays on every frontier , under the banner of the sickle and the star . Men are still starved and beaten , and locked away from the free commerceof thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earthly paradise still creeps across the world like a cancer , and Kamenev still wears the robe of its high priest . This I am pledged to fight , and I have already resisted it with my blood ... . Yet I can not ignore the strange working of God in the souls of the most unlikely men , and I believe I can see this working in the soul of Kamenev . . . . I see , though only dimly , how our destinies may be linked in the divine 71 design . . . . What I can not see is how to comport myself in the situation which exists between us ... . He asks for my friendship , and I would gladly give him my heart . He asks , I think , for a kind of truce , yet I can not make truce with error , though I can ascribe the noblest motives to those who propagate it . I dare not , however , place the Church and the faithful in jeopardy for an illusion , because I know that Kamenev could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Church . What do I do ? Perhaps the answer is in the sunflower  --  that the seed must die before the green shoots come , that the flower must grow while men pass by , heedless that a miracle is taking place under their noses . Perhaps this is what is meant by " waiting upon the mercy of God . " But we can not only wait because the nature with which He has endowed us drives us to action . We must pray , too , in darkness and dryness , under a blind sky ... . Tomorrow I shall offer Mass for Kamenev , and tonight I must pray for light for Kiril the Pontiff , whose heart is restless and whose vagrant soul still hungers for its homeland ... . IIIFOR GEORGE FABER the coronation of Kiril I was a long and elaborate boredom . The ovations deafened him , the lights gave him a headache , the sonorities of the choir depressed his spirit , and the gaudy procession of prelates , priests , monks , chamberlains , and toy soldiers was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment at all . The exhalation of eighty thousand bodies , jammed like sardines into every corner of the Basilica , made him feel faint and nauseated . His copy was already written and filed for transmission : three thousand glowing words on the pageantry and symbolism and religious splendor of this Roman festal ( lay . He had seen it all before , and there was no reason for him to repeat the tedium except , perhaps , the snobbery of sitting in the place of honor in the press box , resplendentin a new frock coat , with the ribbon of his latest Italiandecoration bright upon his chest . Now he was paying for the indulgence . His buttocks were jammed tight between the broad hips of a German and the angular thighs of Campeggio , and there would be no escape for at least two hours , until the **25;4513;TOOLONG broke out into the Square to receive the blessing of the new-crowned Pope with the humbler citizens and tourists of Rome . Exasperated , he slumped forward in his seat and tried to find a grain of consolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far the Curia had kept him tightly in wraps . He had made few public appearances , and no pronouncements of any moment at all . But the word was already about that this was an innovator , a man young enough and strange enough to have a mind of his own and the vigor to express it in action . There were rumors of rough words in the Consistory , and more than one Vatican official was talking of changes , not only in personnel , but in the whole central organization as well . If changes were made , some of them might affect the Holy Roman Rota , where the petition of nullity for Chiara'smarriage had lain in the pigeonholes for nearly two years . The Italians had a wry-mouthed joke for the workings of this august body : " Non c'e divorzio in Italia . . . There is no divorce in Italy  --  and only Catholicscan get it ! " Like most Italian jokes , this one had more than one barb to it . Neither Church nor State admittedthe possibility of divorce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich and a growing number of irregular unions among the poor . The Rota was by constitution a clerical body , but much of its business was in the hands of lay lawyers , specialists in canon law , who formed , for mutual profit , a union as rigid and exclusive as any in the world , so that the business of marital causes banked up in a bottleneck , regardless of the human tragedies which underlay most of them . In theory the Rota must adjudicate equally for those 74 who could pay and for those who could not . In practice the paving petitioner , or the petitioner with Roman infllenee or Roman friendship , could count on quicker dec  --  isiunsby far than his poorer brethren in the Faith . The law was the same for all , but its decisions were dispensed Inure swiftly to those who could command the best service from the advocates . The tag of the joke made another point as well . A decreeof nullity was much easier to obtain if both partners to the marriage consented to the first petition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or conditio , or crimen , it was much easier to do it with two voices . But if one partner only made a petition and the other presented contradictory evidence , the case was doomed to a slow progress and to very probable failure . In such cases the Rota made a neat , if hardly satisfying , distinction : that in the private forum of conscience  --  and , therefore , in fact  --  the contract might be null and void , but until it could he proved so in the external forum , by documented evidence , the two parties must be regarded as married even though they did not live together . If the aggrieved party obtained a divorce and remarried outside the country , he or she would be excommunicated by the Church and prosecuted for bigamy by the State . In practice , therefore , concubinage was the easier state in Italy , since it was more comfortable to be damned inside the Church than out of it and one was much happierloving in sin than serving a prison sentence in the Regina Coeli . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hiara Calitri . As he watched the new Pontiff being vested by his assistantsin front of the high altar , Faber wondered sourly 75 how much he knew or could ever hope to know of the intimate tragedies of his subjects , of the burdens which their beliefs and loyalties laid upon their shoulders . He wondered , too , whether the time had not come to throw aside the caution of a lifetime and break a lance , or his head , for the most contentious cause in Rome , the reform of the Holy Roman Rota . He was not a brilliant man , and certainly not a brave one . He had a capacity for close observation and urbane reportage , and a slightly theatrical knack for ingratiatinghimself with well-bred people . In Rome these things added up to a valuable talent for a correspondent . Now , however , with the climacteric looming , and the lonely years , the talent was not enough . George Faber was in love , and being a Nordic puritan and not a Latin , he needed at all costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him married , being concernedfor the safety of his soul ; but she would rather see him damned by default or rebellion than seem to call in question the sacramental bond which she counted , by divine revelation , indissoluble . So whether he liked it or not , his own fate and Chiara 's were held between the rigid hands of the canonists and the soft , epicene palms of Corrado Calitri , Minister of the Republic . Unless  --  Calitri slackened his grip  --  which he showed no sign of doing  --  they could both stay suspendedtill doomsday in the limbo of those outside the law . Across the nave , in the enclosure reserved for dignitariesof the Republic of Italy , Faber could see the slim patrician figure of his enemy , his breast resplendent with decorations , his face pale as a marble mask . Five years ago he had been a spectacular young deputywitl lila  --  ese money behind him and a cabinet careen already promise . His only handicaps were his bachelor estate and a fondness for gay young men and visiting aesthetes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had put the ministry in his pocket and set the Roman gossips laughing behind their hands . Eighteen months later Chiara , his wife , was in hospital with a nervous breakdown . By the time she had recov- ered , their separation was an accomplished fact . The next step was to file a petition for a declaration of nullity with the Holy Roman Rota , and from this point began the tedi- ous dialogue of the tragicomedy : " The petitioner , Chiara Calitri , alleges first a defect of intention , " so the lawyers deposed on her behalf , " in that her husband entered into the bond of matrimony with- out the full intent to fulfill all the terms of the contract , with respect to cohabitation , procreation , and normal sex- ual commerce . " " I had the fullest intention to fulfill all the terms of the contract . . . . " Thus Corrado Calitri in reply . " But my wife lacked both the will and the experience to assist me to carry them out . The married state implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance from my wife . " " The petitioner alleges also that it was a condition of the marriage that her husband should be a man of nor- mal sexual habits . " " She knew what I was , " said Corrado Calitri in effect . " I made no attempt to conceal my past . Much of it was common knowledge . She married me in spite of it . " " Fine ! " said the auditors of the Rota . " Either of the pleas would be sufficient for a decree of nullity , but a sim- ple statement is not proof . How does the petitioner pro pose to prove her case ? Did her husband express his defective intentions to her or to another ? Was the conditionmade explicit before the contract ? On what occasion ? In what form of speech or writing ? And by whom can the condition be verified ? " So inevitably the wheels of canonical justice ground to a halt , and Chiara 's lawyers advised her discreetly that it was better to suspend the case while new evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion . The men of the Rota stood firm on dogmatic principleand the provisions of the law ; Corrado Calitri was safely married and happily free while she herself was caught like a mouse in the trap he had set for her . The whole city guessed at the next step before she made it . She was twenty-six years old , and within six months she and George Faber were lovers . Rome in its cynical fashion smiled on their union and turned to the merrier scandals of the film colony at Cinecitta . But George Faber was no complaisant lover . He had an itch in his conscience , and he hated the man who forced him to scratch it every day . .. . He felt suddenly dizzy . A sweat broke out on his face and palms , and he struggled to compose himself as the Pope mounted the steps of the altar , supported by his assistants . Campeggio cocked an astute eye at his queasy colleague , and then leaned forward and tapped him on the shoulder . " I do n't like Calitri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going . " Faber sat bolt upright and stared at him with hostile eyes . " What the devil do you mean ? " Campeggio shrugged and smiled . " Do n't be angry , my friend  --  it 's an open secret . And even if it were n't , you 78 have it written on your face . . . . Of course you hate lion , an ( l I do n't blame you . But there are more ways than one to skin a cat . " " I 'd like to hear them , " said Faber irritably. " ( ; all me for lunch one day , and I 'll tell you . " And with that Faber had to be content , but the hope buzzed in his head like a gadfly while Kiril the Pontiff chanted the Coronation Mass and the voices of the choir pealed around the dome of the Basilica . Rudolf Semmering , Father General of the Society of Jesus , stood rigid as a sentinel at his post in the nave and addressed himself to a meditation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Ignatian exercises had given him the facility of projecting himself out of the terms of time and space into a solitude of contemplation . He did not hear the music , or the murmur of the concourse , or the sonorous Latin of the ceremony . His subduedsenses were closed against all intrusion . A vast stillness encompassed him while the faculties of his spirit concentrated themselves upon the essence of the moment : the relationship between the Creator and His creatures , which was being affirmed and renewed by the installation of His Vicar . Here , in symbol , ceremony , and sacrificial act , the nature of the Mystical Body was being displayed  --  Christ the God-man as head , with the Pontiff as His Vicar , enliveningthe whole body by His permanent presence and through the indwelling of the Paraclete . Here was the whole physical order which Christ had established as time visible symbol and the visible instrument of His workingwith humankind  --  the ecclesia , the hierarchy of 79 Pope , bishops , priests , and common folk , united in a singlefaith with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole mission of redemption was summarized  --  therecall of man to his Maker by the dispensationof grace and by the preaching of the New Testament . Here , too , was the darkness of a monstrous mystery : why an omnipotent God had made human instruments capable of rebellion , who could reject the divine design or deface it or inhibit its progress : why the All-Knowing should permit those whom He had made in His own imageto grope their way to union with Him on a knife-edge path , in daily danger of losing themselves forever from His face . Here finally ' as the mystery of the ministerium , the service to which certain men  --  himself among them  --  were called : to assume a greater responsibility and a greater risk , and to show forth in themselves the image of the Godhead for the salvation of their fellows . Which brought him by a round turn to the application of his whole meditation : what he himself must do for service to the Pontiff , the Church , and the Christ , to whom he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by election , of forty thousand celibate men , dedicated to the bidding of the Pontiff in whatever mission he might choose to give them . Some of the best brains in the world were at his command , some of the noblest spirits , the best organizers , the most inspired teachers , the most daring speculators . It was his function not merely to use them as passive instruments , but to help each one to grow according to his nature and his talent , with the spirit of God working in him . It was not enough , either , that he should present the massive network of the Society to the Pontiff and wait fora single command to set it working . The Society , like every other organization and every individual in the Church , had to seek and to propose new modes and new efforts to further the divine mission . It could not sur- render itself either to the fear of novelty or to the corn- fort of traditional methods . The Church was not a static body . It was , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tiny seed , but which  - -   - -  - st grow each year into a new shape and a new fruit- fulness , while more and more birds made nests in its branches . But even a tree did not always grow at the same rate or with the same profusion of leaf and flower . There were times when it seemed that the sap was sparse , or the ground less nourishing , so that the gardener must come and open up the soil and inject new food into the roots . For a long time now Rudolf Semmering had been trou- bled by the reports that came to him from all over the world of a slackening of the influence of his Society and of the Church . More students were drifting away from re- ligious practice in the first years after college . There were fewer candidates for the priesthood and for religious or- ders . The missionary drive seemed to lack impetus . Pul- pit preaching had declined into formality  --  and this in an age when the whole world lived under the shadow of atomic destruction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end they were made , and why they should breed children into so dubious a future . In his younger days in the Society , he had been trained as a historian , and all his later experience had confirmed him in the cyclic and climatic view of history . All his years in the Church had shown him that it grew and changed with the human pattern in spite of  --  or perhaps because of  --  its perennial conformity with the Divine One . There were seasons of mediocrity and times of decadence . There were centuries of brilliance , when genius seemed to spring from every lane and alley . There were times when the human spirit , burdened too long by material existence , leapt from its prison and went shouting , free and fiery , across the rooftops of the world , so that men heard thunders out of a forgotten Heaven and saw once more the trailing splendors of divinity . When he looked up at the great altar and saw the celebrant , moving stiffly under sixty pounds of gilded vestments , he asked himself whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remembering the Pope 's plea for men with winged feet and burning hearts , he wondered whether this was not the first offering he should make out of the resources of the Society  --  a man who could speak the old truths in a fresh mode and walk as ai new apostle in the strange world that had been born out of the mushroom cloud . He had the man , he was sure of it . Even in the Society he was little known because most of his life had been spent in strange places , on projects that seemed to have little relation to matters of the spirit . Yet now it appeared from his writing and his correspondence that he was ready to be used otherwise . His meditation over , Rudolf Semmering , the spare methodicalman , took out his notebook and made a memorandumto send a cable to Djakarta . Then from the dome of the Basilica the trumpets broke out in a long , melodiousfanfare , and he lifted his eyes to see Kiril the Pontiff raise above his head the body of the God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronation Kiril Lakota dressed himself in the black cassock and the platter hat of a Romanin and walked alone out of the Angelic Gate to survey his new bishopric . The guards at the gate hardly glanced at him , being accustomed to the daily procession of Monsignori in and out of the Vatican . He smiled to himself and hid his scarred face behind a handkerchief as he hurried down the Borgo Angelico toward the Castle of Sant ' Angelo . It was a few minutes after ten . The air was still warm and dusty , and the streets were alive with traffic and the passage of pedestrians . He strode out freely , filling his lungs with the new air of freedom , excited as a schoolboy who had just broken bounds . On the Bridge of Sant ' Angelo he stopped and leaned on the parapet , staring down at the gray waters of the Tiber , which had mirrored for five thousand years the follies of emperors , the cavalcade of Popes and princes , and the dozen births and deaths of the Eternal City . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could never belong to anyone else but the successor of Peter . Without the Papacy it could die again and crumble into a provincial relic , because all its resource was in its history , and the history of the Church was half the history of Rome . More than this , Kiril the Russian was now Bishop of the Romans  --  their shepherd , their teacher , their monitorin matters of the spirit . A long time ago it was the Romans who elected the Pope . Even now they claimed to own him , and in a sense , they did . He was anchored to their soil , locked within their walls until the day he died . They might love him , as he hoped they would . They might hate him , as they had many of his predecessors . They would make jokes 83 about him , as they had done for centuries , calling the hoodlums of the town figli di papa , sons of the Pope , and blaming him for the shortcomings of his Cardinals and his clergy . Provoke them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throw his body in the Tiber . But he was theirs and they were his , though half of them never set foot in a church and many of them carried cards which showed them to be Kamenev 's men and not the Pope 's . His mission was to the world , but his home was here , and like any other householder , he must get along with his neighbors as best he could . He crossed the bridge and plunged into the network of lanes and alleys between the Street of the Holy Spirit and the Via Zanardelli , and within five minutes the city had engulfed him . The buildings rose on either hand , gray , pitted , and weather-stained . A pale lamp glimmeredat the shrine of a dusty Madonna . An alley cat , scrabbling in a heap of refuse , turned and spat at him . A pregnant woman leaned in a doorway under the coat of arms of some forgotten prince . A youth on a clattering Vespa shouted as he passed . A pair of prostitutes , gossipingunder a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them made the sign against the evil eye . It was a trivial incident , but it made a deep impression on him . They had told him of this old Roman custom , but this was the first time he had seen it . A priest wore skirts . He was neither man nor woman , but an odd creature who probably was mal'occhio . It was better to be sure than sorry and show him the horns . A moment later he broke out into a narrow square at whose angle there was a bar with tables set on the sidewalk . One of the tables was occupied by a family group munching sweet pastries and chattering in harsh Romandialect ; the other was free , so he sat down and ordered an espresso . The service was perfunctory , and the other guests ignored him . Rome was full of clerics , and one more or less made no matter . As lie sipped the bitter coffee , a wizened fellow with broken shoes sidled up to sell him a newspaper . He fumbledin his cassock for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten to bring any money . He could not even pay for his drink . For a moment he felt humiliatedand embarrassed , then he saw the humor of the situationand decided to make the best of it . He signaled the bartender and explained his situation , turning out his pockets as evidence of good faith . The fellow made a surly mouth and turned away , muttering an imprecation on priests who sucked the blood of the poor . Kiril caught at his sleeve and drew him back . " No , no ! You misunderstand me . I want to pay and I shall pay . " The news vendor and the family waited silently for the beginning of a Roman comedy . " Beh ! " The barman made a sweeping gesture of contempt . " So you want to pay ! But when and with what ? How do I know who you are or where you come from ? " " If you like , " said Kiril with a smile , " I 'll leave you my name and address . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up fifty lire ? " " I 'll send it to you or bring it myself . " " Meantime , who 's out of pocket ? Me ! You think I have so much that I can buy coffee for every priest in Rome ? " They had their laugh then , and they were satisfied . The father of the family fished in his pocket and tossed a few coins expansively on the table . " Here ! Let me pay for it , Padre . And for the paper , too . " " Thank you . . . . I 'm grateful . But I would like to re , pay you . " Nothing , Padre , nothing ! " Pater familias waved a toleranthand . " And you must forgive Giorgio , here . He 's having a bad time with his wife . " Giorgio grunted unhappily and shoved the coins into his pocket . " My mother wanted me to be a priest . Maybe she was right at that . " " Priests have their problems , too , " said Kiril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm told . " " The Pope ! Now there 's a funny one . " This from the paper vendor , who , being a seller of news , claimed the right to comment upon it as well . " They 've really cooked us beautifully this time . A Russian in the Vatican ! Now there 's a story for you ! " He spread the paper on the table and pointed dramatically to the portrait of the Pontiff , which covered nearly half the front page . " Now tell me if he is n't an odd one to foist on us Romans . Look at that face and the  --  " He broke off and stared at the bearded visage of the newcomer . His voice dropped to a whisper . " Dio ! You look just like him . " The others craned over his shoulder , staring at the portrait . " It 's queer , " said Giorgio , " very queer . You 're almost his double . " " I am the Pope , " he told them , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't believe it , " said Giorgio . " You look like him . Sure ! But you 're sitting here , without a lire in your pocket , drinking coffee , and it 's not very good coffee at that . " " It 's better than I get in the Vatican . " Then seeing their confusion and their trouble , he asked 86 for a pencil and wrote their names and their addresses on the hack of a bar check . " I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll send each of you a letter and ask you to come to lunch with me in the Vatican . I 'll pay you back the money then , too . " " You would n't joke with us , Padre ? " asked the news vendor anxiously . " No . I would n't joke with you . You 'll hear from me . " He stood up , folded the newspaper , and shoved it into the pocket of his cassock . Then he laid his hands on the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell the world you 've had a blessing from the Pope . " He made the Sign of the Cross over the little group . " And all of you , tell your friends that you have seen me and that I did n't have enough money for coffee . " They watched him , stupefied , and he strode away , a dark , gaunt figure , but oddly triumphant from his first encounter with his people . It was a petty triumph at best , but he prayed desperatelythat it might be the presage of greater ones . If Creationand Redemption meant anything at all , they meant an affair of love between the Maker and His creatures . If not , then all existence was a horrible irony , unworthy of Omnipotence . Love was an affair of the heart . Its language was the language of the heart . The gestures of love were the simplicities of common intercourse , and not the baroque rituals of ecclesiastical theatre . The tragedies of love were the tragedies of a waiter with sore feet and a wife who did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the Beloved was hidden always behind a veil , so that when one lifted one 's eyes for hope one saw only the official face of priest or Pope or politician . Once , for a short space in a narrow land , God had 87 shown His face to men in the person of His Son , and they had known Him for a loving shepherd , a healer of the sick , a nourisher of the hungry . Then He had hidden Himselfagain , leaving His Church for an extension of Himselfacross the centuries , leaving , too , His vicars and His priesthood to show themselves other Christs for the multitude . If they disdained the commerce of simple men and forgot the language of the heart , then all too soon they were talking to themselves . . . . The alleys closed around him again , and he found himselfwishing that he could peer beyond their blank doors and their blind windows into the lives of their inhabitants . He felt a strange momentary nostalgia for the camps and the prisons , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakened at night to the mutteringof their dreams . He was halfway along a reeking lane when he found himself caught between a closed door and a parked automobile . At the same moment , the door opened and a man stepped out , jostling him against the panels of the car . The man muttered an apology , and then catching sight of the cassock , stopped in his tracks . He said curtly , " There 's a man dying up there . Maybe you can do more for him than I can  --  " " Who are you ? " " A doctor . They never call us until it 's too late . " " Where do I find him ? " " On the second floor . .. Be a little careful . He 's very infectious . T.B .  --  secondary pneumonia and haemothorax . " " Is n't there anyone looking after him ? " " Oh yes . There 's a young woman . She 's very capable  --  better than two of us at a time like this . You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 88 Without another word he turned and hurried down the alley , his footsteps clattering on the cobbles . Kiril the Pontiff pushed open the door and went in . The building was one of those decayed palaces with a littered courtyard and a stairway that smelled of garbage and stale cooking . The treads cracked under his feet , and the banister was greasy to the touch . On the second landing he came on a small knot of peoplehuddled around a weeping woman . They gave him a sidelong , uneasy stare , and when he questioned them one of the men jerked a thumb in the direction of the open door . " He 's in there . " " Has he seen a priest ? " The man shrugged and turned away , and the wailing of the woman went on , unchecked . The apartment was a large , airless room , cluttered as a junk shop and full of the morbid smell of disease . In one corner was a large matrimonial bed where a man lay , fleshless and shrunken , under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair clung damp about his forehead , and his head rolled from side to side on the piled pillows . His breathing was short , painful , and full of rales , and a small bloody foam spilled out of the corners of his mouth . Beside the bed sat a girl , incongruously well groomed for such a place , who wiped the sweat from his forehead and cleansed his lips with a linen swab . When Kiril entered she looked up , and he saw a young face , strangely serene , and a pair of dark , questioning eyes . Ile said awkwardly , " I met the doctor downstairs . He thought I might be able to do something . " 89 The girl shook her head . " I 'm afraid not . He 's in deep shock . I do n't think he 'll last very long . " Her educated voice and her calm professional manner intrigued him . He asked again , " Are you a relative ? " " No . The people around here know me . They send for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a nurse , then ? " " I used to be . " " Has he seen a priest ? ' For the first time , she smiled . " I doubt it . His wife 's Jewish , and he carries a card for the Communist Party . Priests are n't very popular in this quarter . " Once again Kiril the Pontiff was reminded how far he was from being a simple pastor . A priest normally carried in his pocket a small capsule of the Holy Oils for the ad- ministration of the Last Sacraments . He had none , and here a man was dying before his face . He moved to the bed , and the girl made place for him while she repeated the doctor 's warning : " Just watch yourself . He 's very infectious . " Kiril the Pontiff took the slack , moist hand in his own , and then bent so that his lips touched the ear of the dy- ing man . He began to repeat slowly and distinctly the words of the Act of Repentance . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hear me , press my hand . If you can not do that , tell God in your heart you 're sorry . He 's waiting for you with love ; it needs only a thought to take you to Him . " Over and over again he repeated the exhortation while the man 's head lolled restlessly and the fading breath gur- gled in his gullet . Finally the girl said , " No use , Father . He 's too far gone to hear you . " 90Kiril the Pontiff raised his hand and pronounced theabsolution . " Deinde ego to absolvo a peccatis tuis .. . I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . Amen . " Then he knelt by the bed and began to pray passionatelyfor the soul of this shabby voyager who had begun his last lonely pilgrimage while he himself was being crowned in the Basilica of St. Peter . In ten minutes the little tragedy was over , and he said the prayers for the departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body decently in the attitude of death . Then she said firmly : " We should go , Father . Neither of us will be welcome now. , , " I would like to help the family , " said Kiril the Pontiff . " We should go . " She was very definite about it . " They can cope with death . It 's only living that defeats them . " When they walked out of the room , she announced the news bluntly to the little group . " He 's dead . If you need help , call me . " Then she turned away and walked down the stairs , with Kiril at her heels . The high mourning cry of the woman followed them like a malediction . A moment later they were alone in the empty street . The girl fumbled in her handbag for a cigarette and lit it with an unsteady hand . She leaned back against a car and smoked a few moments in silence . Then she said abruptly , " I try to fight against it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people . " " At the end we 're all helpless , " said Kiril soberly . " Why do you do this sort of thing ? " " It 's a long story . I 'd rather not talk about it just now . I 'm driving home  --  can I drop you off somewhere ? " 91 It was on the tip of his tongue to refuse ; then he checked himself and asked , " Where do you live ? " " I have an apartment near the Palatine , behind the Foro Romano . " " Then let me ride with you as far as the Foro . I 've never seen it at night  --  and you look as though you need some company . " She gave him an odd glance , then without a word opened the door of the car . " Let 's go , then . I 've had more than enough for one night . " She drove fast and recklessly until they broke out into the free space where the Forum lay , bleak and ghostly , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out together and walked over to the railing , beyond which the pillars of the Temple of Venus heaved themselves up against the stars . In the terse fashion which seemed habitualto her , she challenged him : " You 're not Italian , are you ? " " No , I 'm Russian . " " And I 've seen you before , have n't I ? " " Probably . They 've printed a lot of pictures of me lately . " " Then what were you doing in Old Rome ? " " I 'm the bishop of the city . I thought I should know at least what it looked like . " " That makes us both foreigners , " said the girl cryptically . " Where do you come from ? " " I was born in Germany , I 'm an American citizen , and I live in Rome . " " Are you a Catholic ? " " I do n't know what I am . I 'm trying to find out . " " This way ? " asked Kiril quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've tried all the others . " Then sloe laughed , and for the first time since their meet- ing she seemed to relax . " Forgive me , I 'm behaving very badly . My name is Ruth Lewin . " " I 'm Kiril Lakota . " " I know . The Pope from the steppes . " " Is that what they call me ? " " Among other things . . . . " She challenged him again . ' These stories they print about you , your time in prison , your escape , are they true ? " " Yes . " " Now you 're in prison again . " " In a way , but I hope to break out of it . " " We 're all in prison , one way or another . " " That 's true . . . . And it 's the ones who understand it that suffer most of all . " For a long moment she was silent , staring down at the tumbled marbles of the Forum . Then she asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's shoes ? " " I do . " " How does it feel ? " " Terrifying . " " Does He speak to you ? Do you hear Him ? " He thought about it for a moment , and then answered her gravely . " In one sense , yes . The knowledge of Him- self which He revealed in the Old Testament and in the New pervades the Church . It is there in the Scripture and in the tradition which has been handed down from the time of the Apostles , and which we call the Deposit of Faith . This is the lamp to my feet . . . . In another sense , no . I pray for divine light , but I must work by human reason . I can not demand miracles . At this moment , for instance , I ask myself what I must do for the people of this city  --  what I can do for you . I have no ready answer . I have no private dialogue with God . I grope in the dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're a strange man . " " We are all strange , " he told her with a smile , " and why not , since each of us is a spark struck off from the fiery mystery of the Godhead ? " Her next words were uttered with a poignant simplicity that touched him almost to tears : " I need help , but I do n't know how , or where , to get it . " For a moment he hesitated , torn between prudence and the promptings of a vulnerable heart . Then once again he felt within him the subtle stirring of power . He was the Pastor and none other . Tonight one soul had slipped through his fingers ; he dare not risk another . " Take me home with you , " he told her . " Make me a cup of coffee , then talk it out . Afterwards you can drive me back to the Vatican . " In a small apartment huddled under the shadow of the Palatine Hill she told him her story . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that hysteria which every confessor feared in his relations with women . " I was born in Germany thirty-five years ago . My familywas Jewish , and it was the time of the pogroms . We were chased about from one country to another , until finally a chance came to enter Spain . Before we applied for visas we were told it might help if we became Catholics . . . . So my parents went through the motions and became converts  --  Moriscos might be a better name ! We took the new identity and we were admitted . " I was a child then , but it seemed that the new countryand the new religion opened their arms to welcome 94 1me . I remember the music , the color , the Holy Week processions winding through the streets of Barcelona , while little girls like me , with white veils and flower wreaths in their hair , threw rose petals before the priest who carried the Monstrance . I had lived so long in fear and uncertainty that it was as if I had been transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in 1941 , we were granted visas for America . The Catholic Charities Bureau took care of us , and with their help I was placed in a convent school . For the first time , I felt thoroughly safe and , strangely enough , thoroughly Catholic . " My parents did not seem to mind . They , too , had reached safe harbor , and they had their own lives to rebuild . For a few years I was serenely happy ; then  --  how do I say it ?  --  my world and I myself began to crack down the middle . I was a child still , but the minds of children open more quickly than adults ever believe . " In Europe millions of Jews were dying . I was a Jew and I was oppressed by the thought that I was a renegade who had bought my safety by forswearing my race and my religion . I was a Catholic , too , and my belief was identifiedwith the freest and happiest time of my life . Yet I could not accept the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blood money . " I began to rebel against the teaching and the disciplineof the convent and yet all the time I knew that I was rebelling against myself . When I began to go out with boys , it was always with the rebels , the ones who rejected any kind of belief . It was safer that way . Perhaps in the end it would be better to believe nothing than to be torn apart by a double allegiance . " Then , after a while , I fell in love with a Jewish boy . I 95 was still a Catholic , so I went to discuss the case with my parish priest . I asked for the usual dispensation to marry someone outside the Faith . To my surprise and my shame , he read me a bitter lecture . I heard him out and then walked out of the rectory , and I have never set foot insidea church since . He was a foolish man , blind and prejudiced . For a while I hated him , and then I understood that I was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband had no fixed belief , nor , it seemed , did I ; but we had a common race and a common heritage , and we were able to live in peace with one another . We made money , we made friends . It was as if I had achieved the continuity which my life had lacked from the beginning . I belonged to someone , to a settled order , and at long last , to myself . " Suddenly , and for no apparent reason , a strange thing happened . I became morbid and depressed . I would wanderaround the house disconsolate , tears rolling down my cheeks , sunk in utter despair . Sometimes I would break out into violent rages at the slightest provocation . There were times when I contemplated suicide , convinced that I would be better dead than inflicting so much unhappinesson myself and on my husband . " In the end my husband forced the issue . He demanded that I see a psychiatrist . At first I refused angrily , and then he told me bluntly that I was destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin treatment , and entered on a course of analysis . " This is a strange and frightening road , but once you begin to walk it you can not turn back . To live life is hard enough . To relive it , to retrace every step in symbol and fantasy and simple memory , is a weird experience . The person who makes the journey with you , the analyst , assunics a multitude of identities : father , mother , lover , hus- hand , teacher  --  even God . " T he longer the journey , the harder the road , because each step brings you closer to the moment of revelation where you must face once and forever the thing from which you have been fleeing . Time and again you try to step off the road or turn back . Always you are forced for- ward . You try to defer , to temporize . You create new lies to deceive yourself and your guide , but the lies are de- molished one by one . " In the middle of my analysis my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another guilt added to all the others . Now I could never restore to him the happiness of which I had robbed him . My whole per- sonality seemed to disintegrate under the shock . I was taken to a nursing home , and the therapy began again . Slowly the nature of my hidden fear became clear to me . When I reached the core of myself , I knew that I should find it empty . I should not only be alone , but hollow as well , because I had built a God in my own image and then destroyed Him , and there was no one to take His place . I must live in a desert , without identity , without purpose , since even if there were a God , I could not ac- cept Him because I had not paid for His presence . " Does this seem strange to you ? It was a terror to me . But once I stood in the desert , empty and solitary , I was calm . I was even whole . I remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of my room and saw the sun shining on the green lawn . I said to my- self , I have seen the worst that can happen to me , and I am still here . The rest , whatever it is , I can endure . ' " A month later I was discharged . I settled my hus- band 's estate and came to Rome . I had money , I was free , I could plan a new life for myself . I might even fall in love again . . . . I tried it , too ; but in love one must commitoneself , and I had nothing to commit . " Then I began to understand something . If I lived for myself and with myself I should always be hollow , always in solitude . My debts to my people and my past were still unpaid ; I could accept nothing from life until I had begun to pay them . " You asked me tonight why I do this kind of service . It 's simple enough . There are many Jews in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the time of the Inquisition , immigrants from Bologna and the Lombardcities . They are still a people apart . Many of them are poor , like the ones you saw tonight . . . . I can give them something . I know I do . But what do I give myself ? Where do I go ? . . . I have no God although I need one desperately . . . . You tell me you stand in His shoescanyou help me ... ? " Extract fromthe Secret Memorials ofK I R I L I , Pont . Max . I am troubled tonight . I am solitary and perplexed . My installation in the See of Peter is complete . I have been crowned with the triple tiara . The ring of the Fisherman is on my finger .

I wonder if the faithful understandthat the Vicar of Christ has often more need of the confessional than they themselves ... . I have seen many men die , but the sad and solitary exit which I witnessed tonight in a Roman tenement aft 99 1flicts me strangely . The words of the woman who saw it with me still ring in my ears : " They can cope with death . It 's the living that defeats them . " It seems to me that this defeat is the measure of our failure in the ministry of the Word . Those who need us most are those who are bowed the lowest under the burden of existence  --  whose life is a daily struggle for simple sustenance , who lack talent and opportunity , who live in fear of officials and tax-gatherers and debt collectors , so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of their souls . Their whole life becomes a creeping despair . . . . If it were not for the infinite knowledge and the infinite mercy of God , I , too , could easily despair . The case of the woman Ruth Lewin gives me more hope . While I was in prison and under the long ordeals of interrogation , I learned much about the intricate functioningof the human mind . I am convinced that those who devote themselves to the study of its workings , and of its infirmities , can do a great service to man and the cause of his salvation . . . . We should not , as shepherdsof souls , treat this infant science with suspicion or hasty censure . Like every other science , it can be wrested to ignoble ends . It is inevitable that many who explore the misty country of the soul will make mistakes and false guesses , but every honest research into the nature of man is also an exploration of the divine intent in his regard . The human psyche is the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , that some of the meaning of the mystery of Divine Grace may be revealed when we understand better the working of the subcon scious mind , where buried memories and buried guilts , 100 Iand buried impulses , germinate for years and then break out into a strange flowering . . . . I must encourage competentmen inside the Church to pursue this study , and to co-operate with those outside it , to make the best use possible of their discoveries ... . The sick mind is a defective instrument in the great symphony which is God 's dialogue with man . Here perImpswe may see a fuller revelation of the meaning of human responsibility and God 's compassion for His creatures . Here we may be able to illuminate the difference between formal guilt and the true status of the soul in the sight of God ... . It might scandalize many if I declared openly that in a woman like this Ruth I see  --  or think I see  --  a chosen spirit . The key to such spirits is their recognition that their wrestling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strangest story in the Old Testament is the story of Jacob , who wrestled with the angel and conquered him and forced the angel to tell his name . . . . But Jacob went away from the struggle limping . I , too , am a limping spirit . I have felt reason and the foundations of my faith rock in the dark bunker and underthe lights and the relentless inquisition of Kamenev . I believe still . I am committed more completely than ever before to the Deposit of Faith , but I am no longer content to say , " God is thus . Man is thus , " and then make an end of it . Wherever I turn on this high pinnacle , I am confronted with mystery . I believe in the Godly harmony which is the result of the eternal creative act . . . . But I do not always hear the harmony . I must wrestle with the cacophony and apparent discord of the score , knowing 101 that I shall not hear the final grand resolution until the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . This is what I tried to explain to Ruth , though I am not sure that I did it very well . I could not bring myself to present her with blunt theological propositions . Her troubled spirit was not ready to receive them . I tried to show her that the crisis of near despair which afflicts many people of intelligence and noble spirit is often a providential act , designed to bring them to an acceptance of their own nature , with all its limitations and inadequacies , and of the conformity of that nature with a divine design whose pattern and whose end we can not fully apprehend . I understand her terrors because I have endured them myself . This I am sure she understood . I advised her to be patient with herself and with God , who , even if she could not believe in Him , still worked in His own fashion and His own secret time . I told her to continue the good work she was doing , but not to regard it always as a payment of debts . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the redemptive act consummated on the Cross by Christ . I tried to show her that to reject the joy of living is to insult Him who provides it , and who gave us the gift of laughter along with the gift of tears ... . These things I think I should write for others because the sickness of the mind is a symptom of our times , and we must all try to heal one another . Man is not meant to live alone . The Creator Himself has affirmed it . We are members of one body . The cure of a sick member is a function of the whole organism . . . . I have asked Ruth to write to me , and sometimes to 102 come and see me . I dare not let this office separate me from direct contact with my people . . . . For this reason I think I should sit in the confessional for an hour each week and administer the Sacrament to those who come into St. Peter 's . The nearest I came to losing my faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an underground bunker . ... When I was brought back to the huts , to the sound of human talk  --  even to the sound of anger and ribaldry and blasphemy  --  it was like a new promise of salvation . . . . I wonder whether this is not the way in which the creativeact renews itself daily : the spirit of God breathing over the dark waters of the human spirit , infusing them with a life whose intensity and diversity we can only guess ... . " In manus tuas , Domine ... Into thy hands , 0 God , I commend all troubled souls . " IVIT W AS nearly six weeks after the coronation before George Faber arranged his luncheon with Campeggio . He might have put it off even longer had not Chiara argued him into it with tears and tantrums . He was by nature a prompt man , but he had lived long enough in Rome to be suspicious of any gratuitous gesture . Campeggiowas a distinguished colleague , to be sure , but he was in no sense a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with the bedding and wedding of Chiara Calitri . So somewhere in the offing was a combinazione  --  a proposition  --  with the price tag carefully hidden until the very last moment . When one lunched with the Romans , one needed a long spoon and a steady hand , and George Faber was still a little shaken by his quarrel with Chiara . Spring was maturing slowly into summer . The azaleas made a riot of color on the Spanish Steps , and the flower sellers did a brisk business with the new roses from Rapallo . Footsore tourists found refuge in the English Tea- 104 105 room , and the traffic swirled irritably around Bernini 's marble boat in the Piazza . To stiffen his small courage , George Faber bought a reel carnation and pinned it jauntily in his buttonhole before he crossed the Square and entered the Via Condotti . The restaurant which Campeggio had named for their rendezvous was a small , discreet place , far away from the normal haunts of newsmen and politicians . . . . In a matter of such delicacy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faber saw little point in secrecy since the Calitri story was common property in Rome . However , it was part of the game that every combinazione , every progetto , must be dressed up with a little theatre . So he submitted with as much good grace as he could muster . Campeggio entertained him for half an hour with a vivid and amusing chronicle of the Vatican , and how the clerical dovecotes were fluttering as the new Pope assertedhimself . Then with a diplomat 's care he steered the talk toward Faber : ... It may please you to know , my dear fellow , that your own dispatches have been very favorably noticed by His Holiness . I am told he is anxious to make more direct contact with the press . There is talk of a regular luncheon with senior correspondents , and your name is , of course , first on the list . " " I 'm flattered , " said Faber dryly . " One tries always to write honestly , but this man is an interesting subject in his own right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , and you are well regarded in the Secretariat of State . . . . These are importantsources and important voices , as you know . " " I 'm well aware of it . " " Good , " said Campeggio briskly . " Then you understand the importance of preserving a good relation without , shall we say , embarrassing incidents . " " I 've always understood that . I 'm interested to know why you bring it up now . " Campeggio pursed his thin lips and looked down the backs of his long , manicured hands . He said carefully , " I make the point to explain my next question . Do you propose setting up house with Chiara Calitri ? " Faber flushed and said testily , " We 've discussed it . So far we have n't made any decision . " " Then let me advise you very strongly not to do it at this moment . . . . Do n't misunderstand me . Your private life is your own affair . " " I 'd hardly call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and myself . I imagine the rumor has reached the Vatican long before this . " Campeggio gave him a thin smile . " So long as it remainsa rumor , they are content to suspend judgment and leave you in the hands of God . There is no question of public infamy which could damage your case with the Rota . " " At this point , " Faber told him bluntly , " we have no case . The whole business is suspended until Chiara can get new evidence . So far she has n't been able to find any . " Campeggio nodded slowly , and then began to trace an intricate pattern on the white tablecloth . " I am told by those who understand the thinking of the Rota that your best hope of a verdict rests on the plea of defective intention . In other words , if you can prove that Calitri entered into the marriage contract without the full intention of fulfilling all its terms  --  and that intention includes fidelity  --  then you have a good chance of a favorable decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you prove what 's in a ( man 's mind ? " " Two ways : by his own sworn statement or by the evidence of those who heard him express the defective inten-tion . " " We looked for people like that . We could n't find any , and I 'm damn sure Calitri wo n't give evidence against himself . " " Put enough pressure on him , and I think he might . " " What kind of pressure ? " For the first time , Campeggio seemed uncertain of himself . He was silent awhile , tracing long , flowing lines with the point of his fork . Finally he said deliberately , " A man like Calitri , who holds a high position and who has , shall we say , an unusual private life , is very vulnerable . He is vulnerable to his party , and to public attack . He is vulnerableto those who have fallen out of his favor . . . . I do n't have to tell you that this is an odd world he lives in  --  a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very permanent . Today 's favorite is rejected tomorrow . There are always bleeding hearts ready to tell their story to a good listener . I 've heard some myself . Once you have enough stories you go to Calitri . " " I go to him ? " " Who else ? You report the news , do n't you ? " " Not that sort of news . " " But you know plenty who do ? " " Yes . " " Then I do n't have to draw pictures for you . " " It 's blackmail , " said George Faber flatly . " Or justice , " said Orlando Campeggio . " It depends on he point of view . " " Even if we did frighten a testimony out of him , hecould then allege undue pressure and the whole case would be thrown out of court for good . " " That 's a risk you have to take . If the stakes are high enough , I think you might be wise to take it . . . . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little help in your inquiry . " " Why ? " asked Faber sharply . " Why should you care a row of beans what happens to Chiara and me ? " " You 've become a Roman , " said Campeggio with cool irony . " Still , its a fair question . I like you . I think you and your girl deserve better than you 're getting . I do n't like Calitri . Nothing would give me greater satisfaction than to see him destroyed . That 's almost impossible , but if your Chiara wins her case it will damage him a great deal . " " Why do you dislike him so much ? " " I 'd rather not answer that question . " " We have common interests . We should at least be honest with each other . " The Roman hesitated a moment , and then threw out his hands in a gesture of defeat . " What does it matter , anyway ? There are no secrets in Rome . I have three sons . One of them works in Calitri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his influence . I do n't blame the boy . Calitri has great charm , and he does n't scruple to use it . " " A dirty business ! " " It 's a dirty town , " said Orlando Campeggio . " I 'm the last man who should say it , but I often wonder why they call it the City of Saints . " While George Faber was still chewing unhappily over his luncheon dialogue , Chiara Calitri was sunning herself on the beach , at Fregene . She was a small dark girl , lithe as a cat ; and the youths 108 1 - 109who passed , idling along the beach , whistled and preened themselves for her attention . Safe behind her sunglasses , she watched them come and go , and stretched herself more decoratively on the colored towel . A sense of comfort and well-being pervaded her . She was young , the admiration of the youths told her she was beautiful . She was loved . Faber in his uneasy fashion was committed to fight her battles . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the freedom which intrigued her most of all , and each day she became more conscious of it , more curious about it , and more eager for its enlargement . This morning she had wept and shouted like a market woman at poor George because he had seemed unwilling to risk a talk with Campeggio . If he wavered again , she would fight him again , because from now on she could not love without the liberty to be herself . With Corrado Calitri she had felt herself torn apart , blown this way and that , like paper shredded on the wind . For a time  --  a terrifying time  --  it was as if she had ceased to exist as a woman . Now at last she had put herselftogether again  --  not the same Chiara but a new one , and no one ever again must have the power to destroy her . Deliberately she had chosen an older man because such were more tolerant and less demanding . They asked a more placid life . They offered affection as well as passion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a woman feel less vulnerable ... . She sat up and began to toy with the warm sand , filteringit between her fingers so that it spilled out and made a small mound at her feet . Inconsequently she thought of an hourglass , in which time measured itself inexorablyin a spilth of golden grains . Even as a child she had been obsessed with time , reaching out for it as she now reached for freedom , spending it recklessly , as if by so doing she could bring the future into today . When she was at home she had cried to go to school . At school she had wanted always to grow up . Grown up at last , she had wanted to be married . In marriage  --  the bitter fiasco of her marriage to Corrado Calitri  --  time had suddenly and dreadfullystood still , so that it seemed she must be anchored eternally to this union with a man who despised her womanhoodand debased it at every opportunity . It was from this terror of static time that she had fled finally into hysteria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly was now intolerable to her . She no longer wanted to advance , but only to retreat into the dark womb of dependence . Even here lime was still her enemy . Life was time ; an unendurable extension of loveless years . The only ways to end it were to die or to stay forever in retreat . But in the hospital the vigilant nurses held death away from her , while the physicians drew her slowly and patiently back to another meeting with life . She had fought against them , but they , too , were inexorable . They stripped her illusions away one by one like layers of skin until the naked nerves were exposed , and she screamed in protest against their cruelty . Then they had begun to show her a strange alchemy : how pain might transmute itself into a mercy . Endure it long enough , and it began to diminish . Run from it , and it followed , always more monstrous , like a pursuer in a nightmare . Fight it , and in the end you could come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always the wisest , but a treaty that was at least bearable . L 110 111 She had made her own treaty with life now , and she was living better than she had hoped under the terms of it . IIcr family disapproved of the bargain , but they were generous enough to give her love and a measure of affection . She could not marry , but she had a man to care for her . The Church condemned her , but so long as she preserveda public discretion it would withhold a public censure . Society , in its paradoxical fashion , registered a mild protest and then accepted her with good enough grace . .. . She was not wholly free , not wholly loved , nor wholly protected , but she had enough of each to make life bearable , and time endurable , because each now held a promiseof betterment . Yet it was not the whole answer , and she knew it . The treaty was not half as favorable as it looked . There was a catch in it  --  a dragnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . She looked out at the empty water of the Tyrrhenian Sea and remembered her father 's tales of all the strange life that inhabited its deeps : corals like trees , whales as big as ships , fish that flapped their wings like birds , jewels that grew in oyster slime , and weeds like the hair of drowned princesses . Under the sunlit surface was a whole mysterious world , and sometimes the waters opened and swallowed down the voyager who risked them too boldly . Sometimes , but not always . . . . The most unlikely sailormen survived and came to safe harbor . Here precisely was the risk of her own contract with life . She believed in God . She believed in the Church 's teaching about Him . She knew the penalty of eternal ruin that hung over the heads of those who rashly dared thedivine displeasure . Every step , every hour , was a tightrope venture of damnation . At any moment the contract might be called in . And then . . . ? Yet even this was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why she and not another had been submitted to the first injustice of a false marriage contract . Why she and not another had been forced into the suicidal confusion of a breakdown . And this precipitategrasping at any straw for survival . Why ? Why ? It was not enough to say , like the parish confessor , that this was God 's dispensation for her . It was Corrado 's dispensationfirst . Did God compound injustice and then hold damnation over the heads of those who wilted under its weight ? It was as if the sea rose up and swirled her back into the confusion of her illness . There was no cure for the untimely thought that came in nighttime or daytime , prickling along the flesh like a cold wind . One could not surrender to it for fear of a new madness . One could not blot it out except by the exercise of love and passion , which in a strange way seemed to affirm what the preachers said they denied : the reality of love and mercy , and the hand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep ... . She shivered in the warm air and stood up , wrapping the towel about her . A brown youth with the figure of a Greek god whistled and called to her , but she ignored him and hurried up the beach toward the car . What did he know of life who vaunted it like a phallic emblem in the sun ? George knew better  --  dear middle-aged , uneasy George , who shared her risk and was at least working to rid her of it . She longed for the comfort of his arms and the sleep that came after the act of love ... . 112 Rudolf Semmering , Father General of the Society of Jesus , sat in the airport at Fiumicino and waited for his man from Djakarta . To those who knew him well his vigil was of singular significance . Rudolf Semmering was an efficient man , adapted by nature and ascetic exercise to the military spirit of Ignatius Loyola . Time to him was a precious commodity because only in time could one preparefor eternity . A waste of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The affairs of his order were complex and pressing , and he might easily have sent a deputy to meet this obscure member who was already thirty minutes late . Yet the occasion seemed to demand a more than normalcourtesy . The newcomer was a Frenchman , a stranger to Rome . He had spent more than twenty years in exile  --  in China , in Africa , in India , and the scattered islands of Indonesia . He was a simple priest , and a distinguished scholar , whom Rudolf Semmering had held in silence under his vow of obedience . For a scholar the silence was worse than exile . He was free to work , to correspond with his colleagues all over the world , but he was prevented by a formal obedience from publishing the results of his research or teaching on any public rostrum . Many times in the last decade RudolfSemmering had questioned his own conscience about this prohibition laid on so brilliant a mind . Yet always he had come to rest on his first conviction , that this was a chosen spirit which discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term of silence to found themselves firmly . A man with a sense of history , Semmering was convinced that the effectiveness of an idea depended on the 113 temper of the time into which it was first introduced . Ii was too late in history to risk another Galileo affair oz the burning of a new Giordano Bruno . The Church was still suffering from the sad debates over the Chinese rites . He was less afraid of heresy than of a climate of thought which could make heresy out of a new aspect of truth . He lacked neither compassion nor understanding of the sacrificeshe demanded of a noble mind such as this one , but Jean Telemond , like every other member of the Society , had vowed himself to obedience , and when it had been exacted of him he had submitted himself . For Semmering this was the final test of the metal of a religious man , the final evidence of his capacity for a Godly work in a position of trust . Now the test was over , and he wanted to explain himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a right to expect from his father in the spirit . Soon he would be asking Telemond to walk a new road , no longer solitary , no longer inhibited , but exposed , as he had never been exposed before , to the temptations of influence and the attacks of jealous interests . This time , he would need support more than discipline , and Semmering wanted to offer them with warmth and generosity . Diplomacy was involved as well . Since the time of Pacellithe Cardinals of the Curia and the Bishops of the Church had been afraid of any attempt to introduce a Gray Eminenoe into the counsels of the Pontiff . They wanted , and so far they had had , a return to the natural order of the Church , where the Curia were the counsellorsof the Pontiff and the bishops were his co-workers , acknowledging his primacy as the successor of Peter , but holding equally to their own apostolic autonomy . If the Society of Jesus gave any appearance of attempting to 114 115 pi-sh a favorite into the Papal Court , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called for men , and the question was now how to offer this one without appearing to canvassfor him . . . . The voice of the traffic-caller crackled over the amplifiers , announcing the arrival of a BOAC flight from Djakarta , Rangoon , New Delhi , Karachi , Beirut . Rudolf Semmering stood up , smoothed down his cassock , and walked toward the customs entrance to meet the exile . Jean Telemond would have been a striking man in any company . Six feet tall , straight as a ramrod , lean of visage , with gray hair and cool , humorous blue eyes , he wore his clerical black like a military uniform , while the yellow malarial tinge of his skin and the furrows about his upturnedmouth told the story of his campaigns in exotic places . He greeted his superior with respectful reserve , and then turned to the porter who was struggling with three heavy suitcases . " Be careful with those . There 's half a lifetime of work in them . " To Semmering he said with a shrug , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my papers with me . " The Father General gave him one of his rare smiles . " You were right , Father . You 've been away too long . Now we need you here . " A spark of mischief twinkled in Telemond 's blue eyes . " I was afraid I was to be hauled before the Inquisition . " Semmering laughed . " Not yet . . . . You 're very , very welcome , Father . " " I 'm glad , " said Telemond with curious simplicity . " These have been difficult years for me . " Rudolf Semmering was startled . He had not expected a man so brusque and aware . At the same time , he felt a small glow of satisfaction . This was no vague savant , but a man with a clear mind and a stout heart . Silence had not broken him , nor exile subdued him . An obedient spirit was one thing , but a man with a broken will was no use to himself or to the Church . Semmering answered him gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you 've suffered . I have , perhaps , made your life more difficult than it needed to be . I ask only that you believe I acted in good faith . " " I 've never doubted that , " said Jean Telemond absently . " But twenty years is a long time . " He was silent awhile , watching the green meadows of Ostia , dotted with old ruins and new excavations , where red poppies grew between the cracks of ancient stones . Suddenly he said , " Am I still under suspicion , Father ? " " Suspicion of what ? " Telemond shrugged . " Heresy , rebellion , a secret modernism , I do n't know . You were never very clear with me " " I tried to be , " said Semmering mildly . " I tried to explain that prudence was involved , and not orthodoxy . Some of your early papers and lectures came under the notice of the Holy Office . You were neither condemned nor censured . They felt , and I agreed with them , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great authority , you see . We wanted it used to the best advantage of the Faith . " " I believe that , " said Jean Telemond . " Otherwise I think I should have abandoned the work altogether . " He hesitateda moment , and then asked , " Where do I stand now ? " 116 " We have brought you home , " said Semmering gently , " because we value you , and we need you . There is work for you here , urgent work . " " I have never made conditions ; you know that . I have never tried to bargain with God or with the Society . I worked as best I could within the limits imposed on me . Now . . . now I should like to ask something . " " Ask it , " said Rudolf Semmering . " I think , " said Telemond carefully , " I think I have gone as far as I can on this lonely road . I think what I have done needs to be tested by discussion and debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit my thesis to open criticism . This is the only way knowledge grows , the only way the horizons of the spirit are enlarged . . . . I have never asked for anything before , but in this I beg for your support , and for the support of the Society . " " You have it , " said Rudolf Semmering . In the cramped seats of the speeding automobile they faced each other , superior and subject , the man under obedience , the man who exacted the fulfillment of the vow . Telemond 's lean face crumpled a little , and his blue eyes were misty . He said awkwardly , " I  --  I did not expect so much . This is quite a home-coming . " " It is better than you know , " said the Father General gently . " But there are still risks . " " " I 've always known there would be . What do you want me to do ? " " First you have to pass a test . It will be a rough one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What sort of test ? " " July thirty-first is the feast day of St. Ignatius Loyola . " " I was ordained on that day . " " " It makes a good omen , then , because on that same day His Holiness will visit the Gregorian University , which , you know , owed its beginning to our founder and St. Francis Borgia . . . . I want you to deliver the memorial lecture in the presence of His Holiness , the teaching staff , and the students . " " God help me , " said Jean Telemond . " God help my stumbling tongue . " " As they turned into the clamor of the city , through the Porta San Paolo , he buried his face in his hands and wept . Ruth Lewin sat under a striped umbrella on the Via Veneto , sipped an aranciata , and watched the lunch-time crowds disperse toward siesta . The soft air of summer lifted her spirits , and she felt as if all the weight of the world could be shrugged off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have taken on a new face . The clamor of the traffic was a friendly sound . The folk were better dressed than usual . The waiters were more courteous . The ogling of the men was a compliment . Nothing had changed in her situation . None of her doubts or dilemmas had resolved themselves , yet their burden was lighter , and she wore it with a better humor . It was as if her long convalescence were over and she could take her place confidently in the normal commerce of the world . It was not all an illusion . She had suffered too long the perilous alternations of exaltation and depression to deceiveherself about her cure . But the swings were shorter now  --  the heights less dizzy , the deeps less terrifying . The pulse of life was returning to a regular beat . The fever had broken at last , and the moment of crisis had been her 118meeting with Kiril the Pontiff in a Roman back alley . Even flow the memory was lit by a kind of wonder . His aspect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast between his office and his humble dress . Yet when she had confronted him in her own house , over the banality of coffee and biscuits , the impression was not of strangenessbut of extraordinary simplicity . Ever since her break with the Church she had had a creeping distaste for clerical talk and the forms of clerical convention . This man had none of them . He wore his belieflike a skin , and his convictions were expressed with the gentleness of one who had acquired them at a price he would not ask others to pay . His words came out newmintedand ringing with sincerity : ... All life is a mystery , but the answer to the mysteryis outside ourselves , and not inside . You ca n't go on peeling yourself like an onion , hoping that when you come to the last layer you will find what an onion really is . At the end you are left with nothing . The mystery of an onion is still unexplained because like man , it is the issue of an eternal creative act . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell you any more . Do n't you see ? This is what I am here to teach  --  a mystery ! People who demand to have Creation explained from beginning to end are asking the impossible . Have you ever thought that by demandingto know the explanation for everything you are committingan act of pride ? We are limited creatures . How can anyone of us encompass infinity . . . ? " In the mouth of another the words would have sounded dry and stilted , but from this Kiril they came endowed with a quality of healing , because they were not read from a book , but from the palimpsest of his own heart . He had not reproached her for the dereliction of a baptismal 119faith , but had talked of it with kindness , as if it were even a sort of mercy in itself . " No two people come to God by the same road . There are very , very few who reach Him without stumbling and falling . There are seeds that grow a long time in darkness before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are others that come to the light at one thrust in a single day . . . . You are in darkness now , but if you want the light you will come to it in time . . . . The humansoul , you see , meets barriers that it must cross , and they are not always crossed at one stride . The direction in which the soul travels is the important thing . If it travels away from itself , then it must ultimately come to God . If it turns back upon itself , this is a course of suicide , because without God we are nothing . . . . Everything , therefore , that urges you to an outward growth  --  service , love , the simplest interest in the world  --  can be a steptoward Him .... " Disturbed as she was on that night , she had not taken in the full import of all that he had said . But the words had remained imprinted on her memory , and each day she found in them a new meaning and a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer sun , watching the folly and flirtation of the town , passing no judgment on it or on herself , it was because of this Kiril , who sat in the seat of judgment and yet withheld verdict . If love were possible again , it would be because of him who lived solitary in the celibate city of the Vatican . Love . . . ! It was a chameleon word , and she had seen more of its changes and colorations than she could admit without blushing . Every big city had its enclave of cripples and oddities and vagrants who sustained life on the best terms they 120 could get and were grateful for the most temporary easement from lonely misery . Here in Rome the kingdom of the beggars of love was a weird and polyglot domain , and in her time she had wandered over most of it . It was a treacherous journey for a widow of thirty-five with money in the bank and a heart empty of resources . Unhappy boys had wept at her breast for their mothers . Straying husbands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble names had made her the confidante of their exotic attachments . The secret sisterhoodhad offered her entry to the sapphic mysteries . In the end she had emerged , shaken and unsatisfied , knowing that even in the half-world of the odd ones there was no place for her . Love ... ! Here on the Via Veneto pretty girls with poodles on a leash sold it by the night 's installment . In the clubs and bars any woman with a foreign accent could buy it for a smile and the flirting of a lace handkerchief . ... But where and how did one find the person on whom to spend this newly discovered self  --  so fragile and sucMenly so precious ? Miraculously , Humpty-Dumpty had been picked up and put together again . He was sitting back on the wall , smiling and clapping hands at the concourse . But if he tumbled again and the glue came unstuck . . . who then could patch the eggshell ? 0 little white wandering spirit , please , please stay in one piece ! Out of the clamor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruth Lewin ! Where have you been hiding your-self ? " She looked up to see George Faber , gray-haired and dapper as any Roman dandy , looking down at her . In his private study Kiril the Pontiff was closeted with two of his senior ministers : Cardinal Goldoni , his Secretaryof State , and Cardinal Clemente Platino , Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith . The purpose of their meeting was a daylong stock-taking of the affairs of the Church , Holy , Universal , and Apostolic . The study was a large room bare of ornament save for a carved wooden crucifix behind the Pontiff 's desk and , on the oppositewall , a case full of maps showing the distribution of Catholic communities throughout the world . In another setting and another dress they might have been a trio of international businessmen : the Pontiff , dark , bearded , and exotic ; the Secretary of State , gray , stocky , and harshly eloquent ; Platino , tall , olive-skinned , urbane , with a great eagle beak inherited from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they were dedicated , each to the limit of his own talent , to a folly that promised small profit to any business : the preparation of all men for death and for union with an unseen God . Their talk ranged over a multitude of subjects : money , politics , militarytreaties , economic agreements , personalities in high places round the globe ; yet the core of the discussion was always the same : how to spread throughout the world the knowledge of Christ , His teaching , and the society which He had set up to preserve and disseminate it . For them every question  --  how a man married , how he was educated , what he was paid , his national allegiance  --  was at root a theological proposition . It had to do with the Creator and the creatures and the eternal relationship of one with the other . Everything that was done in the dimension of time had its roots and its continuity in eternity. 122 123 When the Secretary of State appointed an ambassador to Austria or a legate to Uruguay , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that in a climate of accord between Church and State hnnian souls might be led the more easily to the knowledge and the practice of a saving truth . When Platino appointed this missionary congregation or that to go into the jungles of the Amazon , he did so with the fullest conviction that he was obeying a clear command of Christ to carry a Gospel of hope to those who sat in darkness and the shadow of death . It was , however , a point of view that raised special problems of its own . Men who did a Godly work were apt to become careless about the human aspect of it . Men who dealt with the currency of eternity were apt to rest too hopefully on the future and let the present slip out of their control . Those who were sustained by the **29;4540;TOOLONG of the Church were protected too softly from the consequence of their own mistakes . With so much tradition to rest on , they were often prickly and suspicious abotrt new modes of Christian action . Yet in spite of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world in which they lived and of the fact that to do the work of God they had to come to terms with what man had done for himself or to himself . Platino was making this point now . His long brown finger pointed to a spot in Southeast Asia . ... Here , for example , Holiness , is Thailand . Constitutionallyit is a monarchy . In fact it is a military dictatorship . The religion of the state is Buddhism . At one time or another in his life every male of the royal family , and every senior official , takes the saffron robe and spends some time in a monastery . We have schools here . They arerun by nuns and teaching priests . They are free to give religious instruction , but not within normal school hours . Those who wish to be instructed in the Faith must come outside these times . This is our first difficulty . There is another . Government appointments  --  and any position of consequence is a government appointment  --  are only open to Buddhists . Officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact it is true . The country is underdeveloped . Most commerce is in the hands of Chinese , so that for all practicalpurposes , a man who becomes a Christian must give up all hope of economic or social advancement . . . . The temper of the people , which has also been conditioned by Buddhist belief , is resistant to change and suspicious of outside influence ... . " On the other hand , there is evident among the young men a growing interior conflict . They are being brought every day into closer contact with Western civilization through American military and economic aid , but there is little opportunity or work for them . I have been given what I believe is a reliable statistic , that twenty-five per cent of senior male students are addicted to heroin before they leave school . You see the problem . flow do we move to make a real penetration of the minds and hearts of the people ? " " How do you summarize the work we are doing now ? " asked the Pontiff gravely .

However , the number of conversions is small , 124 and we have not yet entered effectively into the mind and heart of the country . " " Ve have a worse position in Japan , " said Goldoni in his brisk fashion . " We have a concordat which gives us nnich more effective working conditions than we have in ' I'lhailand , but here again we have made no real break-through .

Too little was done too slowly . Now the continent is moving toward a federation of independent African nations , and the ground has been cut from under our feet . . . . Here in Brazil you have an immense industrial expansion , and a huge population of peasants living in the most grinding poverty . To whom are they turning to champion their cause ?

" Goldoni breathed a silent sigh of relief and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State had to deal with a situation as it was , with diplomats and politicians as they were  --  good or bad , pagan or Chris- 125 tian . Platino , on the other hand , was charged directly with the spread of Christian belief throughout the world . His authority was enormous , and inside the Church they called him " the Red Pope , " as the Father General of the Jesuits was called the black one . Platino did not answer directly , but picked up from the desk two photographs , which he held out to the Pontiff . One of them showed a fuzzy-haired Papuan in a white shirt and white lap-lap , with a small crucifix hung round his neck . The other was the picture of a native from the uplands of New Guinea with a headdress of bird-of-paradisefeathers and a pig tusk thrust through his nose . As the Pontiff examined the photographs , Platino explainedthem carefully : " Perhaps these two men will answer your Holiness ' question . They both come from the same island , New Guinea . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become so as the pivot of a federation of South Pacific islands . In two years , five at most , New Guinea will be an independent country . This man ... " He pointed to the photograph of the man who wore the crucifix . " This is a mission boy . A teacher in one of our Catholic schools on the coast . He has lived all his life in a mission colony . He speaks English and pidgin and Motu . He teaches the catechism , and has been proposed as a candidate for the priesthood . . . . This one is a tribal chief from the mountains : a leader of twenty thousand men . He speaks no English , he understands pidgin , but speaks only his own upland dialect . He is wearing now a ceremonial dress . He still holds to the old pagan beliefs . . . . Yet when independence is granted to this country , he is the most likely leader , while our mission boy will have no influence at ail 126 " Tell me wily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a long time , Holiness , " said 1'latinn deliberately . " I have prayed much . I am still not sure that I am right , but this is what I believe . With our mission boy we have in one sense succeeded admirably . We have educated a good human being . We have set him in the way of salvation . He lives chastely , deals justly , and displays in himself the example of a Godly life . If he becomes a priest , he will teach the Word and dispense the grace of the Sacraments to those with whom he comes in contact . In him and those like him the Church fulfills her prime mission  --  the sanctification of individual humansouls . . . . In another sense , however , we have failed because in this boy  --  how shall I say it ?  --  we have limited the relevance of the Faith . . . . In the mission we have created a small , safe world for him . A Christian world , yes , but one that has cut itself off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have made him an apolitical individual , and man by his nature is a political and social animal who has an immortal soul . . . . We have left him , in large part , unprepared for the dialogue which he must sustain throughout his life with the rest of his fellows in the flesh .... Look at our friend here , the one with the tusk through his nose . He is a man of power because he practices polygamy and each wife brings him a plot of land and then cultivates it for him . He holds to the old beliefs because these are his ground of communication with his tribe . He is their mediator with the spirits as he is their mediator with men of other tongues . He understands tribal law and tribal justice . In the difficulty and confusion which will follow the granting of independence , he will speak with more authority and more relevancethan our mission boy because he has not been 127 divorced from the realities of social existence . . . . Your Holiness spoke of Brazil and the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Church has to deal with man in the circumstances in which he lives . If he is hungry , we have to feed him ; if he is oppressed , we must defend him so that he may have , at least , a minimumfreedom to set his soul in order . We can not preach from the pulpit , Thou shalt not steal , ' and then stand by , inactive , while political or social injustice is done to those who sit and listen to our preaching . . . . We see a strange example in Poland , where the Church has had for very survival to enter actively into a conversation with elements hostile to it . It has had to prove itself relevant , and it has done so . It lives the more strongly for that very reason , even though it lives more painfully . . . . " He paused and mopped his forehead with a handkerchief . " Forgive me , Holiness , if I speak more strongly still . We have all seen the progress that was made under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities . Our work in this field has only begun , but it seems to me that where we have been defensive , where we have retreated , holding the Faith to ourselves as though it could be tarnished by contact with the world , there we have failed . Where we have held it up for a witness , where we have affirmed most boldly that the Gospel is relevant to every human act and every situation , there we have done well . " " You affirm it , " said Kiril the Pontiff bluntly . " I affirm it , as do our brother bishops scattered across the world , but the affirmation does not reach the people with the same clearness and the same fruitfulness  --  it does not even reach my Romans here . Why ? " " I think , " said the Secretary of State brusquely , " the world is educating itself more quickly than the Church . Put it another way .

From the internal-combustion engine to this moment the line leaps almost vertically , pointing to the moon . .. . Tempora mutantur . . . " he quoted wryly . " Times change , and man changes with them . ' If our mission means anything , it means that each new enlargement of the human mind should be an enlargement of man 's capacity to know , love , and serve God . " " I think , " said Kiril the Pontiff with a smile , " I should send you both out on a missionary journey . " He crossed to his desk and sat down , facing them . He seemed to gather himself for a moment , and then very quietly , almost humbly , he explained himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager man . It has been my fear , since I have sat in the Chair of Peter , that I should act too hastily and damage the Church , which is given into my hands . . . . I have tried to be prudent and restrained ; I have understood also that one man in his lifetime can not change the world . The symbol of the Cross is a symbol of the apparent failure and folly of God himself . . . . But it is my office to teach and to direct , and I have decided now where I want to begin . . . . What you have told me confirms me in the decision . I am grateful to you both . I want you both to pray for me . " The two Cardinals sat silent , waiting for him to go on . To their surprise , he shook his head . " Be patient with me . I need time and prayer before I declare myself . Go in the name of God . " " I suppose , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're wondering why I 'm telling you all this about Chiara and me . " Ruth Lewin laughed and shrugged . " That 's the way it goes in Rome  --  everybody 's got a story . And a stranger 's usually the best listener . " " We 're not really strangers , though . How many times have we met ? Half a dozen , at least . At the Antonellis ' and at Herman Seidler 's and  --  " " So I 'm convinced we 're not strangers . Take it from there . " " I was feeling low  --  and I was delighted to see you . " " Thank you , kind sir . " " And I do n't tell my life story to every girl I meet on a street corner . " " I do n't think it matters in Rome whether you tell it or not . People know it just the same  --  in different versions , of course !

" " Where do you belong ? " " I 've often wondered that myself . " " Do you have many friends here ? " " A few . They call me for dinner sometimes . I visit them when I feel inclined .

" Is anyone ? Are you 'd .. " I'in in a mess , " said George Faber bluntly . " That 's not your reputation . " Faber looked up sharply , wondering if she was mockinghim .

" " That means you 're not sure . " " No , I 'm not sure . " As if to divert her attention he signaled the waiter to bring him another cup of coffee . Then he lit a cigarette and stared moodily at the shop front on the other side of the pavement . For all her detachment , Ruth Lewin felt herself touched by a pang of pity for him . He was no longer young , though most women would find him attractive . He had built himself a comfortable career and a respectablename in his trade . Now he was being asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might grow tired of him and look for younger loving . She dropped her teasingtone and questioned him more gently . " What does Chiara want ? " " Freedom at any price . " " Even at the price of your career ? " " I 'm not sure of that , either . " " Do n't you think you should ask her ? " " That 's what bothers me . . . . I 'm not even clear myselfwhat the risks are . All I know is that on the one hand , there 's an element of blackmail and I 'm to be the blackmailer . . . Do n't misunderstand me . I 've been in this game a long time . I know that every newsman is tempted at some time or another to use his position for his own profit . My experience is that those who do it always lose in the end . I 've never been a muckraker , and I 'm rather proud of it . . . . On the other hand , I 'm fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you start a fight with Corrado Calitri , " said Ruth Lewin soberly , " I can promise you it will be a very rough one . He stared at her , surprised . " Do you know Calitri , then ? " " I know some of the people he knows . They play very dirty when their feelings are hurt . " He hesitated a moment , and then faced her with the question . " Could you help me to meet some of them ? " " No . " She was very definite about it . " Why not ? " " I lived in that little Arcady for a while . I did n't like it . I do n't want to go back . Besides , you 're a newsman . You have your own contacts . " " Not too many I can trust . Would you be willing to give me names . . . information ? " To his surprise , she burst out laughing , and then seeing his discomfiture , she laid an apologetic hand on his wrist. 133 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'm in the telephonebook . " On which indecisive note they parted . As she rode home through the clamor of the afternoon traffic , she remembered that it was late in the day for her , too , and she felt again the pang of treacherous pity for George Faber and his puzzled middle-aged heart. 132 " Poor George ! I should n't laugh at you . But I wonder . . . I really wonder ... " "  --  ' lint ? " " About you and Chiara . Are you both so sure you can go through with this fight  --  win or lose ? If you lose , you know , they 'll tear you into little pieces and feed you to the lions like early Christians . The Church wo n't have either of you . You 'll never be welcome again at the Vati- can or on the Quirinale . Are you both ready for that ? Do you have enough love for Chiara ? Does she have enough for you ? " He shrugged and spread his hands in a Roman gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about love . Everybody plays at it in his own fashion . I 've played , too , but now it 's late in the day for me . I do n't want to make a mistake . " " I 'd like to help you , " she told him quietly , " but it 's your life and your girl . . . . I should go now ; it 's getting late . " " Would you let me take you home ? " " Better not . I 'll get a taxi . " " Could I see you again ? " " Why , George ? " He flushed unhappily . " I 've enjoyed talking to you . I hope you 'll decide to help me . And if I go ahead with this Calitri business , I 'll need to talk to someone I can trust . " " What makes you think you can trust me ? " " You said yourself you do n't belong to the gossip cir- cuit . I 'd like to add that you 're a very grown-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give me ? " Once again his rare humor asserted itself . " Give me time , and I may think of others . " Extract fromthe Secret Memorials ofK I R I L I , Pont . Max . ... It is an hour after midnight  --  the beginning of a new day . An important day for me because for the first time I shall begin to address myself to the whole Church . Late last evening I asked my confessor to come to me so that I might purge myself from the sins of the day and purify myself for the task I am about to undertake . Afterwards I begged him to stay with me a little while and serve the Mass which I wanted to celebrate immediately after midnight . . . . It is strange how much varietythere can be for a priest in the offering of the Sacrifice . Sometimes one is dry and unmoved , one has to make an effort of will to concentrate on the familiar ritual and on the staggering significance of the Act of Consecration . At other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " into the spirit , " as St. John puts it . One isaware of God . One is at the same moment humbled and exalted , afraid and rapturously glad ... . Tonight it was different again . I began to understand in a new fashion the nature of my office . When , at the moment of elevation , I lifted the Host above my head , I saw the real meaning of the " we " with which the Pontiffs have addressed themselves customarily to the world . It is not " I " who am to speak or to write , it is the Church through me and Christ through me and the Church ... . I am myself , yes . But if I speak only of myself , and for myself , I am nothing . I am like the wind bells , whose sound changes with every breeze . . . . But the Word cannotchange . The Word is immutable . . . . " In the beginningwas the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renew itself in me as the redemptive act of the Crucifixionrenews itself at the hands of every priest when he says Mass . I am the reed through which the voice of the spirit must be blown so that men may hear it in the mode of their own times . . . . The paper is blank before me , the pens are ready . Is Kiril ready ? I pray that he may be . What must he write ? And how and to whom ? My subject is education , the preparation of a man to take his place in this world and in the next . My letter will be a discussion of the educative office of the Churchitsmission to " lead out " the soul of man from the darknessof ignorance , from the bondage of the flesh , into the light and the freedom of the sons of God . . . . How shall I write ? As simply as I can because the deepesttruth is the most simply stated . I must write from the heart  --  cor ad cor loquitur . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best fashion for every man to 136 talk of Cod , and to Him . Later the Latinists will take niv words and harden them into the antique form which will preserve them for a permanent record in the Church . After them will come the translators , who will turn them into a hundred other tongues in which the Word of God must be preached . . . . The world is a Babel Tower of conflicting voices , but inside the Church there is and must always be " the unity of the spirit in the bond of faith . " Outside the Church , too , there is a unity which we neglect too often . It is the unity of men who suffer togethera common existence , delight in common joys , and share the same confusions , regrets , and temptations . .. . I am reminded of something forgotten too often by us the shepherds , Tertullian 's Testimony of the Soul . .. . " Man is one name belonging to every nation upon earth . In them all is one soul though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the subjects of which the untutored soul speaks , are the same everywhere . " There is another reason why I want to write in Russian . I want Kamenev to see my letter as it came from my own hand . I want him to hear through it the tones of my voice so that he may know that I love him and the people among whom I was born . If it were possible I should like him to have my manuscript , but it may be difficult to get it into his hands , and I could not risk compromising him . To whom shall I write ? . . . To the whole Church  --  to my brother bishops , to all priests and monks and nuns , to all the faithful , without whom our office is meaningless . I must show them how their mission is not merely to teach but to educate one another with love and forbearance , each lending of his own strength to the weak , of his own knowledge to the ignorant , of his charity to all ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must begin to act through the administration of the Church to see that reforms are made where they are needed and that the inertia of a large and scattered organization does not stand in the way of God 's intention . I must have patience , too , and tolerance , understanding that I have no right to demand of God a visible success in all I attempt . I am the gardener . I plant the seed and water it , knowing that death may take me before I see the bud or the flower . It is late and I must begin . . . . " Kiril , the servant of the servants of God , to the bishops and brethren of all the Churches , peace and apostolic benediction .... " 139 THE HOME-COMING of Jean Telemond , S.J. , was a drab little affair that belied the warmth of his superior 's welcome . The headquarters of the Society , at No. 5 Borgo Santo Spirito , was a large gray building , bleak as a barracks , that nestled under the shadow of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without discernible beauty . The only man to greet him was the brother porter , a gray and crusty veteran who had seen so many members come and go that one more made no matter . The whole aspect of the place was cheerless and temporary , a shelter for men whose training was to divest themselves of comfort and human attachment and make themselves soldiers of Christ . Even the religious emblems were ugly and mass-produced , reminders only of the interiorlife which no symbol could properly convey . After they had prayed together , the Father General led him to his room , a small , whitewashed box , furnished with a bed , a prie-dieu , a crucifix , a desk , and a set of bookshelves . Its dusty windows looked out on a courtyard , chill and deserted even under the summer sun . JeanTelemond had lived more harshly than most and in less friendly places , but this first look at the Mother House plunged him into a deep depression of spirit . He felt solitary and naked and strangely afraid . The Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce him to his colleagues at suppertime , and then left him to his own devices . It took him only a few moments to unpack his meager personal belongings , and then he set about the task of laying out the mass of notes , manuscripts , and bulky folders which represented his life-work . Now , when the time had come to make the tally of it and present it to the world , it seemed small and insignificant . For twenty years he had worked as a paleontologist , in China , in Africa , in America , and the far Indies , plotting the geography of change , the history of life recorded in the crust of the earth . The best scientific minds had been his colleagues and co-workers . He had survived war and revolution and disease and loneliness . He had endured the perilous dichotomy between his function as a scientist and his life as a religious priest . To what end ? For years the conviction had been growing in him that the only intelligible purpose of so much effort and sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimateconvergence of the spiritual and physical which would mark the eternal completion of an eternal creative Impulse . Many times he had pondered the significance of the old proverb " God writes straight with crooked lines , " and he was convinced to the marrow of his bone that the final vector of all the diverse forces of Creation was an arrow pointing straight to a personal divinity . Many another before him had attempted this justificationof God to men . Their achievements and their fail- 140 ores were the milestones of human thought  --  Plato , St. Augustine , Albertus Magnus , Thomas of Aquin . . . Each had used the knowledge of his own time to build a theologyor a philosophy or a cosmology . . . . Each had added another stage to the journey of unaided reason ; each had elevated man thus much above the jungle that spawned him . For Telemond the project presented itself in another form : to trace , from the text of the living earth , the journeyfrom unlife to life , from life to consciousness , from consciousness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the past , he believed , was the key to the pattern of the future . The justification of the past and of the present lay in the tomorrow that would thrust out of them . He could not believe in a wasteful Creator or in a diffuse , accidental , purposeless Creation . At the root of all his thought and , he believed , at the root of every human aspiration was an instinctive desire for a unity and a harmony in the cosmos . Once men abandoned their hope for it , they condemned themselves to suicide or madness . That the harmony did exist , he was convinced beyond doubt . That it could be demonstrated , he believed also  --  though in another mode of credence . The pattern was laid , but it was not yet complete . He believed he had grasped the main lines of it , but his problem was to explainthem in terms intelligible and acceptable . So vast an exposure needed new words , new levels of thought , new analogies , and a new boldness in speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unified knowledge of the world . Even in the Church the spiral thinking of the Eastern fathers , the traditionalChristian gnosis , had been overshadowed by the 141 nominalist and rationalist tradition of Western theologians . Now , if ever , the hope of the world 's survival seemed to rest on a leap out of mere logic into a recognition of new and bolder modes of communication . Yet the terror of this first moment in Rome was that under the first impact of this noisy , brawling city , where past and present rubbed elbows with each other at every step , his conviction seemed to be weakening . Rome was so sure of itself , so sophisticated , so skeptical , so certain that everything that had happened or could happen had been weighed and judged beyond dispute  --  that his own voice must sound small and meaningless . A long time ago , from a hut on the fringe of the Gobi Desert , he had written , " I understand now how little mere travel gives to a man . Unless the spirit expands with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man as he went out . " Here in the Mother House of the Society , where all the rooms looked the same , where everyone was dressed in the same black cassock and attended the same exercises of devotion and ate at the same table , he wondered whether in truth he had changed at all , and whether the enlargement which he thought to have attained was not a bitter illusion . With a gesture of impatience he stacked the last manuscripts on the desk , closed the door on them , and walked out to view the city which threatened him so vividly . A few moments ' walking brought him out onto the broad reach of the Street of Conciliation and in full view of the Piazza of St. Peter . The slim finger of the obelisk pointed to the sky , and on either hand Bernini 's colonnadesswept backward to the sunlit dome of the Basilica . The sudden majesty of it all  --  the towering cupola , the gi- 142 gantie figures of windy stone , the rearing masses of collimnsand pilasters  --  oppressed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . Instinctively he lowered his eyes to the human aspect : the straggle of afternoon tourists , the coachmen gossiping at their horses ' heads , the peddlers with their little boxes of rosaries , the buses and automobiles , and the slim jets of the fountains . Once again the cogs of memory slipped into gear , and he remembered what he had written after his first look at the Grand Canyon of the Colorado ... . " I am either unmoved or tremendously troubled by the sight of natural grandeur , or even by a spectacular artifactdeserted by its makers . As soon as man appears , I am comforted again because man is the only significant link between the physical order and the spiritual one . Withoutman the universe is a howling wasteland contemplatedby an unseen Deity . . . . " If man deserted even this ageless splendor of St. Peter 's , it would decay and rot into a goat-cropping , where tree roots grew out of the stones and animals drank from the muddy basins of the fountains . Encouraged , he strolled across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look up at the papal apartments and ask himself what manner of man now dwelt in them . Soon they would meet face to face , and Jean Telemond would have to justify his own life 's work to a man charged to perpetuate the life of the whole Church . Already rumors were rife about the new Pontiff and his challenge to the reactionaries and the extreme traditionalists in the Vatican . There were those who saw him as the prime mover of a second renaissance within the Church , a new and unexpected link between the logicalWest and the illuminated East. 143 If the rumors were true , then there was hope that Jean Telemond might be freed at last from his exile . If not .. . On the opposite side of the Piazza lay the Palace of the Holy Office , where the Hounds of God kept watch over the Deposit of Faith . To them Jean Telemond was known already . Once a priest came under their scrutiny he was never forgotten , and everything he wrote must pass through their hands before it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he of the white mane and the cold eye and the uncertain temper . It was an open secret that Leone had small liking for the Father General of the Jesuits and that he favored more the opinions and the manners of the older orders in the Church . Telemond wondered what had prompted Semmering to risk the displeasureof the old lion by bringing back to Rome a man of suspect opinions . There were politics inside the Church as well as out of it . There were questing minds and reluctant ones . There were blind traditionalists and too eager innovators . There were men who sacrificed order to growth , and others who reached so boldly for change that they held it back for centuries . There were rank pietists and fierce ascetics . There were administrators and apostles  --  and God help any luckless fellow who was caught between the millstones . There was only one refuge ; one committal , which he had made a long time ago . A man could walk only the path he saw at his own feet or that which was pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the hands of God . . . . And their compass was more generous , their hold more reassuring , than the hands of any man . In spite of the warmth he shivered and quickened his 144 steps toward the interior of the Basilica . Looking neither to right nor left , he walked down the echoing nave toward the sanctuary , and then knelt for a long time , prayingat the tomb of Peter . In the small , cold hours between midnight and dawn George Faber lay wakeful and grappled with his new situation . Beside him Chiara lay sleeping like a child , satiated and tranquil . Never in the months of their lovinghad he experienced a passion so tumultuous , a matingso abandoned as on this night . Every sense had quickened , every emotion had surged up and spent itself in a climax of union so intense that death itself had seemed only a whisper away . Never had he felt so much a man . Never had Chiara shown herself so generously a woman . Never had speech been stifled so swiftly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never in all his life had he been so suddenly overwhelmedby the sadness of the afterward . When their loving was done , Chiara had given a small contented sigh , buried her face in the pillow , and lapsed immediately into sleep . It was as if she had left him without warning and without farewell to embark on a privatejourney  --  as if having touched the limit of love , he were left solitary to face the darkness and the terrors of an endless night . The terrors were more real than they had ever been before . For so rich a pleasuring , sometime , somehow , a price must be paid . And he knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that he would be the one to pay it . What he had felt this night was a springtime flowering which might never repeat itself , because for him it was late summer , 145 late harvest , with the taxman waiting at the gate to claim his due . For Chiara life was still her debtor . Payment had been deferred too long and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man on the wrong side of forty , the case was far other . He knew where the price tags were hidden . He knew the needs that followed the brisk satisfaction of the act of union : the need of continuity , the need of children to be born of the seed so richly spent in lust or love , the need of quiet harbor and a morning sunlight after the storms of the night . Even as he thought about it , Chiara stirred and turned toward him for warmth . It was a gesture made in a dream , but it was more eloquent than words . Until her marriage to Calitri she had been protected at every step  --  by rich and doting parents , by cosseting nuns , by the traditions of her class . When her marriage had failed , she had found another refuge , and now she had come to rest in his arms to forgetfulness in his practiced embrace . So long as he held her strongly and securely , she would stay . But the moment his grip slackened or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was that she saw nothing one-sided in the bargain . She had given him her body , she had given him her reputation ; what else was there to demand ? Had he told her , she would never have understood . Married and the mother of children , she would grow in the end to maturity , but in this halfway state she would always be the girl-woman , half delighted by the adventure , half afraid of its consequences , but never wholly understanding that the debt of love was not all paid in the coinage of the flesh. 146 For her even tonight 's encounter , rich , ruinous and wonderful , was a kind of flight  --  and he was too old , too wise , or too calculating to make it with her . Instinctively he turned , threw his arms about her , and drew her to him , wondering even as he did so why the miraculous oneness of the flesh should last so short a time , and why in the end two lovers must lie so often and so long like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his body , her hair brushed his lips , her perfume surrounded him . But sleep would not come , and he rehearsed over and over again their dinner-table talk , when he had told her of Campeggio 's advice , and where it might lead the pair of them ... . She had listened attentively , chin cupped in her hands , her dark eyes bright with eagerness , intrigued by the prospect of a plot . " Of course , darling ! It 's so simple . Why did n't we think of it before ? There must be twenty people in Rome who 'd be happy to give evidence against Corrado . All we 've got to do is find them . " " Do you know any of them , Chiara ? " " Not really . Corrado was always fairly discreet with me . Still , I 'm sure if we talked around we 'd get a whole list of names . " " The one thing we must n't do , " he told her firmly , " is talk around . If word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . Do n't you understand ? This is a conspir- acy . " " George , darling , do n't be so melodramatic . All we 're trying to do is get justice for me . You could n't call that conspiracy , surely . " " It wears the color of it . And in the eyes of the Church , and civil law , it comes to the same thing . There are only 147 two things we can do  --  employ a professional investigator or I 'll have to do the investigation myself . If we use an investigator , it will cost me more money than I can afford , and in the end he could sell me out to your husband . If I do the job myself . . . I 'm immediately embroiled up to the neck . " She stared at him , wide-eyed and innocent . " Are you afraid , George ? " " Yes , I am . " " Of my husband ? " " Of his influence , yes . " " Do n't you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . But once we 're married we have to live . If I lose my reputation in Rome I ca n't work here any longer . We 'd have to go back to America . " " I would n't mind that . . . . Besides , what about my reputation ? I did n't throw that in your face , did I ? " " Please , Chiara ! Please try to understand this is n't a matter of morals , it 's a matter of authority , professional status . . . the credit I live by . If I 'm held up as a commonblackmailer . . . where do I start again ? This is the double standard , sweetheart . You can sleep around as much as you like . You can make a million by exploitingthe poor . But if you pass a bad check for ten dollars or breach the code of professional ethics , you 're dead and buried and there 's no coming back . That 's the way the world is , rough as guts . Do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip  --  God help you ! That 's what we have to face  --  together . " " If I 'm not afraid , George , why should you be ? " " I 've got to be sure that you know what 's involved . " " I wonder if you really know what 's involved for me . A woman needs to be married , George . She needs to have 148 a home and children , and a man who belongs to her . What we have is wonderful , but it is n't enough . If you wo n't fight for it , George , what can I do ? " ... And there it was , the challenge that had taken him at one stride to her arms  --  a challenge to his virility , a challenge to the one folly he had never indulged  --  to count the world well lost for love . But George Faber was a man of his own world . He knew himself too well to believe that he could live without it . He had made the gesture , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirling windmills , but when the time came to assault them with sword and lance , how would he be then ? A knight in shining armor with his lady 's favor on his helm . . . ? Or an aging Quixote on a spavined nag , an object of laughter for men and angels ? Valerio Cardinal Rinaldi sat on the terrace of his villa and watched the day decline toward the sea . The folds of the land were full of purple shadows , the hills were touched with gold and bronze , and the rooftops of village and farmhouse shone russet in the glow . A small breeze stirred across the land , carrying the scent of lilac and roses , and mown grass . The sound of childish laughter rose from the garden below , where his niece 's daughter played among the Orphic marbles . This was the good time  --  the hour between day and dusk , when the eye was rested from the harshness of the sun and the spirit was not yet touched by the melancholy of twilight . The cicadas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirping . He picked up the book that lay on his lap and began to read the crabbed Greek characters which hid the magical words of Eurip-ides : 149 And 0 for that quiet garden by the Western seaWhere the daughters of Evening sing Under the golden apple-tree ; Where the bold sailor wanderingFinds the Ocean-god has barredHis Westward path over the purple waste ! Where huge Atlas lives to guardThe solemn frontiers of the sky ! Where Zeus ' palace fountains of ambrosial wineFlow by the festal couch divine , While holy Earth heaps high Her fruits of rarest tasteTo bless the immortal feast with bountiful supply ! He was a lucky man and he knew it . It was given to few to arrive at eminence and then survive it with a strong heart and a good digestion to enjoy the quiet garden where the Daughters of Evening sang . It was given to few in his profession to hear the voices of children in his own orchard close , to have them cluster about his knee for a story , to give them a kiss and an old priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before their time . Others , again , survived painfully , with blear eyes or palsied limbs or slow cankers , on the charity of the Church . Some lapsed into senility or a poverty of possession and spirit . But he sat here in the splendor of a fading day  --  prosperous , independent , the last of the princely Cardinals of the Church . He had few regrets , because regret had alwaysseemed a vanity and alien to his nature . He was ready for retirement  --  prepared for it , too , by a curious and scholarly mind and a diversity of friendships and interests . He did not fear death because in the normal course it was still a long way off , and he had lived an 150 orderly life , investing his talents as best he knew for the service of the Church . Yet sometimes  --  in the twilight hour , in the wakeful nights of an old man , or when he watched the peasants bending over the tillage of his estate  --  the poignant question presented itself : Why have I so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so niggardly a fashion ? Or is this all a divine irony whose point will be revealed only in eternity ? Old Euripides had raised the same question and yet answered it no better : They wander over the waves , visit strange cities , Seeking a world of wealth , All alike sure of achievement ; yetOne man 's aim misses the lucky moment , Another finds fortune in his lap . And there was another question still . What did one do with all this fruitage of life ? Toss it away , like little Brother Francis , and walk the world singing the praise of Lady Poverty ? It was too late in the day for that . The grace of abandonment had passed him by  --  if , indeed , it had ever been offered . For better or for worse , he was saddled with the career he had built . He was neither gluttonous nor spendthrift . He was educatinghis sister 's children , and a pair of needy students for the priesthood . When he died half his wealth would go to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pontiff himself had approved the disposition . For what , then , should he reproach himself ? For nothing , it seemed , except , perhaps , a certain mediocrity of spirit , a need of his nature to have the best of both worlds . And yet GodAlmighty had made them both , the seen and the unseen , for man 's habitation and benefit . He had made man , too , and it was the nature of His mercy to exact no more than a just return on the talent He had given to each one . Valerio Rinaldi was wise enough not to rejoice too freely in his good fortune . Yet he could not weep because there was nothing to weep for . So he sighed a little as the shadows drew closer over the land and went on reading the story of Hippolytus , the son of Theseus : To go into the dark ! Now let me die , and passTo the world under the earth , into the joyless dark ! Since you , dearer than all , are at my side no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the deaththat has swallowed you . When twilight came at last , he closed his book and went in to say evening prayers with his household , and then prepare himself for dinner with Cardinal Leone . The white-haired inquisitor was growling and crusty as ever , but he softened instantly at the entry of the children . When they bobbed before him , three dark-haired little maids , to receive his blessing , his eyes clouded and his hands trembled as he laid them on their foreheads . When the children backed away respectfully , he drew them to him and talked gravely as any grandfather about their lessons and their dolls and the momentous event of a day at the zoo . Rinaldi smiled secretly to see the old lion tamed so swiftly . He was even more surprised when the man who was the guardian of so many mysteries fumbled his way through a jigsaw puzzle and begged for time for the children to finish it with him . When at last the children were dismissed and dinner 152 was announced , Leone was strangely subdued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky man , Rinaldi . For this you s ! unlcl be grateful to God all the days of your life . " " I am grateful , " said Rinaldi . " It troubles me that I have done so little to deserve my happiness . " " Enjoy it , my friend . It 's the purest one you will ever know . " Then he added a poignant afterthought . " When I was in the seminary , one of my old masters said that every priest should be given a child to rear for five years . I did n't understand what he meant then . I do now . " " Do you have any relatives ? " asked Rinaldi . " None . I used to think that as priests we did n't need them . That 's an illusion , of course . . One gets lonely in the cloth as well as out of it . " He grunted and gave a wintry smile . " Eh ! We all get sentimental when we 're old . " They dined alone as befitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weightiest secrets of the Church . An elderly manservant waited on them and withdrew after each course was served , so that they might talk freely . Leone seemed oddly moved by his meeting with the children , and as he picked absently at his fish he reverted once more to the problems of a celibate life . ... Every year , as you know , we get a small crop of cases at the Holy Office : priests who get into trouble with women , unsavory affairs between teachers and pu- pils , and allegations of soliciting by priests in the con- fessional . It 's inevitable , of course . There are bad apples in every barrel , but the older I get the less sure I am of how to deal with them . " Rinaldi nodded agreement . He himself had served a ; a commissioner of the Holy Office and was privy to it ; most diverse deliberations . Leone went on : " We have a very bad case in front of us now , affecting a Roman priest and a young woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl has fallen pregnant , and there is possibility of open scandal . I felt bound to bring the affair to the personal notice of the Holy Father . " " How did he take it ? " " More calmly than I expected . The priest in question has , of course , been suspended from his duties ; but His Holiness ordered that he be required to submit to a medicaland psychiatric examination before the case is finally decided . . . . It 's an unusual step . " " Do you disagree with it ? " asked Rinaldi quizzically . " The way it was put to me , " said Leone thoughtfully , " I was in no position to disagree . His Holiness pointed out that no matter what a priest does he is still an erring soul in need of help ; that punishment was not enough ; that we had to help the man to mend his error and his life . He went on to say that modern research had shown that many sexual aberrations had their roots in a real sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special problems for those of a psychotic disposition . . . . The ruling of the canons is guarded on this point , but not , of course , prohibitive . A priest may seek or be given psychiatric treatment only in grave cases and with the permissionof the bishop . The authority of the Holy Father is supreme in the matter . " " You still have n't said whether you agreed with his decision , " said Rinaldi in his mild , ironic fashion . Leone chuckled . " I know , I know . I have a bad reputation . To the Church at large I am still the Grand Inquisitor , ready to purge out error by rack and fire . . . . But it is n't true . I am always in dilemma in these matters. 154 I have to he so careful of discipline . I am torn always between compassion and my duty to enforce the law ... . I 've net this man . He 's a sad , troubled creature . We can break him with a word , and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , what about the woman , and the child which is to be born ? " " What did His Holiness have to say about that ? " " He wants the child made a ward of the Church . He wants the girl provided with employment and a dowry . Once again , you see , there is a question of precedent . But I admire his attitude even though I am not sure I can agree with all of it . He has a soft heart . . . . The danger is that it may be too soft for the good of the Church . " " He has suffered more than we . Perhaps he has more right to trust his heart than we have . " " I know that . I could wish he trusted me a little more . " " I know he trusts you . " Rinaldi made the point firmly . " I know he has a great respect for you . Has he moved against you in any way ? " " Not yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do you mean ? " Leone cocked a shrewd eye at his host . " Do n't tell me you have n't heard . The Father General of the Jesuitshas brought this Telemond fellow back to Rome . He 's arranged for him to speak in the presence of the Pope on the feast of St. Ignatius Loyola . " " I heard about it . I 'm invited to be present . I do n't think it means too much . Telemond is a distinguished scholar . I think it 's only natural that Semmering should want to reinstate him and give him a wider field of action in the Church . " " I think it 's a calculated step , " said Leone bluntly. 155 " Semmering and I rub each other the wrong way . He knows that Telemond 's opinions are still suspect . " " Come , come , old friend ! He 's had twenty years to revisethem , and you certainly ca n't call him a rebellious spirit . He submitted , did n't he , when silence was imposedon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to restate his position . " " The occasion is too public . Too symbolic , if you want . I think Semmering has committed an indiscretion . " " What are you really afraid of , my friend ? A victory for the Jesuits ? " Leone growled and tossed his white mane . " You know that is n't true . They do God 's work , as we try to do it , in our own fashion . " " What , then ? " " Have you met this Jean Telemond ? " No . " I have . He 's a man of great charm and , I think , of singular spirituality . I think he may make a very favorableimpression on the Holy Father . I believe that 's what Semmering 's expecting , too . " " Is that a bad thing ? " " It could be . If he has the patronage of the Pontiff , then he is much freer to promulgate his opinions . " " But the Holy Office is still there to monitor them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a man under papal patronage . " " I think you 're making two unfounded assumptions  --  that he will get papal patronage , and that you will have to move against him . " " We have to be ready for anything that happens . " " Is n't there a simpler way ? Why not raise the matter with the Holy Father now ? " 156 " And what do I tell him ? That I mistrust his dis- ere ' loll , or that he does n't trust me enough ? " " I can see that might be difficult . " Rinaldi laughed and rang the bell for the next course . " I 'll give you my advice . Relax . Enjoy your dinner , and let the affair take its own way . Even the Holy Office ca n't do as well for the Church as the Holy Ghost . . . . " Leone smiled grimly and addressed himself to the roast . " I 'm getting old , my friend  --  old and stubborn . I ca n't get used to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple crown . " Rinaldi shrugged like a true Roman . " I think the tiara fits him very well . And there is nothing in the Faith which prescribes that the Church must be a gerontocracy  --  a government of old men . I have time to think now , and I am sure age does n't always make us wiser . " " Do n't mistake me . I see the good that this man brings to us . He goes out like a true shepherd among the flock . He visits the hospitals and the prisons . Last Sunday , be- lieve it or not , he sat through three sermons , in three different Roman churches . . . just to hear what kind of preaching we had in our pulpits . " " I hope he was impressed . " " He was not , " said Leone with tart humor . " He made no secret of it . He talked of turgid rhetoric ' and vague devotion . ' I think we may hear something of this in the encyclical which he is preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not yet . I hear he is still working on the first Russian version . . . . We may be in for some surprises . . . . " He laughed ruefully . " I 've already had a few myself . His I Ioliness disapproves of the tone of certain Holy Office proclamations . He feels they are too stringent , too harsh . He wants us to refrain from outright condemnation , especiallyof persons , and to adopt a tone rather of admonitionai.d warning . " " Did he say why ? " " He put it very clearly . He said we must leave room to move for men of good will even when they are in error . We must point out the error , but we must not do injusticeto the intentions of those who commit it . " Rinaldi permitted himself a thin smile . " I begin to see why you are worried about Jean Telemond . " Leone ignored the joke and growled , " I 'm inclined to agree with Benedetti . This man is a reformer . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking , I believe , of a reform of the Rota , of changes in seminary training , and even of separate commissions to represent the variousnational Churches in Rome . " " That could be a good move , " said Rinaldi thoughtfully . " I think that everyone but us Romans agrees that we have centralized too much . We live in troubled times , and if there is another war , then the Churches of the world will be much more isolated than they have ever been . The sooner they can develop a vigorous local life , the better for the Faith . " " If there is another war , my friend . . . it may well be the end of the world . " " Thank God things seem to be a little calmer at pres-ent . " Leone shook his head . " The calm is deceptive , I think . The pressure is building up , and before another year is out I think we may see a renewal of crisis . Goldoni was talking to me about it only yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wonder , " asked Rinaldi softly . " I wonder how the 158 crisis looks to a man who has sat for seventeen years in the shadow of death . " To Kiril the Pontiff the crisis presented itself in a varietyof aspects . Ile saw it first in microcosm , on the battleground of his own soul . At the lowest level  --  the level at which he had lived in the prison bunker  --  there was the simple impulse to survival : the desperate effort to cling to that single spark of life which , once extingushed , could never be lit again . There was only one infusion of life into the frail vessel of the body . Once the vessel was broken , it would never be put together again until the day of the last restoration . So with the infusion of life was infused also the instinct to preserve it at all costs against whateverthreatened , or seemed to threaten it , from within or without . Every animal contained within itself a mechanism of survival . Only man , the last and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the mechanismmust run down and that sooner or later he must make a conscious act of abandonment of the gift into the hand of the Creator , Who had first given it . This was the act for which all his living was a preparation ; to refuse it was to commit the final rebellion , from which there was no recanting . Yet every day of every man 's life was a series of small rebellions against the fear of death or of sporadic victoriesfor hope in the unseen . Even for Kiril , the Vicar of God on earth , there was no retreat from the daily war . The impulse to survival took many forms : the delight in power which gave a man the illusion of immortality ; the fear of opposition which might limit the illusion ; the de- 159 sire for friendship to buttress the weak body and falteringspirit ; the urge to action which affirmed a man 's potency against threatening circumstance ; the desire to possess what must in the end be foregone ; the cowardice which thrust him into isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of death . Even for a Pontiff , who stood by presumption nearest to God , there was no guarantee of victory over himself . Each day brought its own tally of defeats which must be repented and purged in the penitential tribunal . But what of other men , so much less enlightened , so much more vulnerable , so much more oppressed by the terror of bodily extinction ? On them the pressures of existencebuilt up to the breaking point every day . For them he must find in himself a strength to lend , and a charity to spend , lest they collapse utterly under the burden , or turn and rend each other in a feral war , which would blot them out quicker than the merciful death from which they fled . This was the other aspect of the crisis which he read in every report which was laid on his desk , in every newspaper and bulletin which came under his notice . When a man in a capsule was shot into a new dimensionof space and time , the world exulted as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . When a new program of armament was announced , it seemed that those who promoted it wrote with the one hand a new profit into the stock market while with the other they inscribed their own epitaph . Each economic treaty brought advantage to those who signed it and a degree of injustice to those whom it excluded . The populations of the East and the Africas were
