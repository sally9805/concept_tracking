Lockheed Aircraft Corp. , Burbank , Calif , probably will " gradually build up " its inventories during the current quarter after holding them steady for more than six months , a company official says . Manufacturers whittled $200 million out of their stockpiles of raw materials , parts and semi-finished items in March , the latest month for which figures are available . That left the stocks $2.1 billion below the $33.7 billion seasonally-adjusted high of last May and June . A Wall Street Journal survey of 54 companies in a cross section of major industries finds , 50% began working to build stocks in April . Only 22% continued to make reductions and several of these say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing BtP  --  ine.o . The efforts to build inventories reflect improving business and stepped-up production in many industries . Nearly 70 ' , ' ; of the companies interviewed say incoming orders are rising more than seasonally , continuing a general trend that began in February . Despite growing optimism , however , most companies report they 'll rebuild stocks slowly , avoiding the costly over-optimistic buying that marked early 1960 . They 're relying on improved methods of inventory control and the easy availability of most materials to prevent shortages . They do n't see the troubled international situation as any immediate threat to their raw materials supplies . With most manufacturers buying cautiously , their efforts to build stocks could be thwarted ? if inventory purchases fail to keep pace with rising production .

" Our business has shown a smooth , steady rise and we 'll be building inventory for the next couple of months . " " Our end-of-March inventories were down 18% from a year ago , but the indications are they are rising now , " reports a spokesman for Timken Roller Bearing Co. , Canton . Ohio . Timken 's business began rising slightly last month . " We see indications customers are adding to their inveutories of bearings , " he lays .

A Mixed Picture The automotive industry , which buys a wide variety of materials including metals , tires and plastics , presents a mixed picture , with some companies holding back on inventory building until production of 1961 models is corn-. pleted this summer and the change over to 1962 's begins . But at least one major producer will boost inventory in May and June to keep up with increased production schedules . A quick step-up in the company 's schedules , last month caused it unexpectedly to eat into its stockpiles . The auto industry as a whole expects to turn out 17% more cars this month than it did in April . Inventories of major automotive parts producers reflect this pickup .

" The trend will continue , " he adds , Some Seasonal Gain . The increase in orders many companies are experiencing , which is leading them to try to build stocks . is in some cases primarily seasonal American Can Co and Continental Can Co , both of New York , have been reducing their stock of metal for can making but now expect a seasonal build-up corresponding with a rise in production Demand for cans normally increases in the second and third quarters as fruit , vegetable and beverage canning increases . Norge division of Borg-Warner Corp , Chicago , began pushing up inventories in April in anticipation of the usual launching of new home laundry appliance models in the next 60 to 90 daps , a spokesman said .

Normally the company expects production to drop off and inventories to decline during the summer , but , says H. J. Nave , executive vice president , " we 've received some very substantial orders and we may have no fall-off this year . " Manufacturers report their efforts to build stocks are not based on fears their suppliers will run short of goods . They do n't expect demand to rise sharply enough to tax output capacity in any materials or components industries A few executives , however , ate reacting to some mild tightening in their supply lines . A notable example : Users of galvanized steel Behlen Manufacturing Co , Co. ' lumbus , Neb producer of farm buildings used for livestock and storage , is typical . " We 're building a 60-day supply of galvanized , twice what we had a few weeks ago , ? says Gilbert Behlen , vice president . " It takes us six weeks to get the material from the mills now , compared with three weeks last winter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase tonnage on hand , he explains , " but then we might get a bulge in business and be caught short . " Automotive companies are using larger quantities of galvanized and heavier demand from construction industries is helping to fill mills ' production schedules for the item Ordering Earlier Steel users generally are finding they must place orders a bit earlier to get delivery when they want it . " We 've decided to improve our position a little on some steel items ; we 've cut our stocks pretty low and now we 've no- tired sonic tightening in mill schedules , " explains W E Olds , president of the Standard Rata% n , s Equipment division of Chicago 's Stanray Cm p Steel mill output has climbed above an ' ; of capacity from a rate in the miri.in'a and null officials say they have n't as much flesibility to meet last-minute orders as they did %%hen operations were slot , . er Most steel users , liras ever , do n't consider the increase in coder lead times great enough yet to warrant putting mote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some price increases in the months ahead is causing a han/iful of executives to begin buying a little extra . " We 've placed commitments for brass for the next six months to beat a price rise and the result probably will be we 'll have a four to six months ' supply by fall , " says Arnold Meyer , president of Universal Screw Co. , Evanston , Ill , fastener producer . The concern 's brass stocks currently amount to less than three months ' supply . But the majority of companies insist the high cost of carrying heavier inventory takes much of the benefit from price-hedge stockpiling . Though they are lifting the size of their inventories in terms of value or tonnage , most manufactut ers insist they will maintain fewer days supply of materials than they have in past periods of rising business . Computers Speed fluild-Up Chicago 's International Harvester Co. now uses computers to translate any production schedule changes into raw material and parts requirements . As a result , it takes the company only eight days after it decides to boost output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated formulas for determining requirements kept buyers and production planners busy for five weeks getting orders placed . The result of the speed-up is that Harvester needs smaller inventories to protect itself against any sudden step-up in business . Whirlpool Corp . ' s big refrigerator and freezer plant at Evansville , Ind. , Is another case in point . Through a newly organized materials and production control department , the plant has sliced its minimum inventory requirements on steel by 15% and on copper , aluminum and plastics by 50% in the last year . For one thing , Whirlpool is keeping a sharper eye on the movement of materials to the plant . Formerly the plant kept a few extra days ' supply of an insulating material on hand to protect against shipment delays . Now company officials keep careful track of each boxcar of the material as it leaves a supplier 's plant in Kansas City and when there 's a delay they send out trucks to remove the material from the sidetracked car and rush it to the Whirlpool plant . Another step : The company has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly would have shipped to Whirlpool for storage . In return for larger quantity orders , one local producer of shipping cartons now keeps material made to Whirlpool specifications at its own plant ready for quick shipment . This shift in the location of the inventory allows some concerns to cut stocks , but naturally it boosts the stocks of others , Chain Belt 's Mr. Carpenter complains , for examPlia " Customers are demanding such short delivery times we have to inventory some goods for them " He terms this a by-product of the severe cost-cutting programs many big companies have been pursuing during the last year .
