The commemoration of courageous moments and men brings out the best in President Kennedy . He likes heroes , medal winners and war stories . He stood tall and proud last week at the White House reception for Astronaut Gordon Cooper . In Manhattan , at the brief dedication of a monument to the 4,596 American men who perished in western Atlantic waters during World War II , the President was moved to emotion and eloquence . <P> The Generous Hands . A destroyer boomed a 21-gun salute , flags fluttered , and the noon sun bore down on Battery Park at the lower tip of Manhattan . The President stood solemnly before the memorial-eight 19-ft. granite pylons that bear the names of the dead and a giant bronze eagle that looks across the bay toward the Statue of Liberty . He spoke of the sea , struggle , sacrifice , and " what it all meant that we should be in such hazard today . " Declared the President : " It means that every generation of Americans must be expected in their time to do their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those associated with it . There is no final victory , but rather all Americans must be always prepared to play their proper part in a difficult and dangerous world . " <P> Kennedy 's 1-day New York trip also had its less stirring political moments . Some 600 business and professional men and Democratic notables , calling themselves the President 's Club , chipped in $1,000 each to throw a birthday party for Kennedy at the Waldorf-Astoria . He would not be 46 for six more days , but it was a good excuse to come to the aid of the Democratic Party 's chronic deficit with an estimated $600,000 . During the dinner , a smiling Kennedy table-hopped to shake the generous hands . Alan Jay Lerner , the My Fair Lady lyricist and a Kennedy schoolmate at Choate and Harvard , directed a show-biz crowd that included Jimmy Durante , Louis Armstrong , and Brother-in-Law Peter Lawford through some tired song-and-dance routines . Audrey Hepburn sang " Happy Birthday " - and it was all , according to at least three different witnesses , " just awful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than the President 's press conference , earlier in the week . There , as happens with increasing frequency , Kennedy was asked a lot of silly questions-and did not improve much on them in his answers . Inevitably Sarah McClendon , who is becoming television 's most monumental bore , got her chance , rang in with a rambling query about an obscure Texas lead smelter that few people a quarter-mile outside of El Paso had ever heard of . <P> Rather than cut Sarah off , as she so richly deserves , the President of the U.S. promised to " look into it . " Then there was a question about what Kennedy had once called the " genie " of unrestricted nuclear testing . With U.S.-Russian test-ban talks at a standstill , a reporter asked : " The genie , sir , is it out of the bottle ? " <P> Replied Kennedy : " Well , it 's neither in nor out right now , but I would say that we ought to-we 'll know by the end of the summer whether it 's finally out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy leaped for the exit like a small boy on the last day of school .
