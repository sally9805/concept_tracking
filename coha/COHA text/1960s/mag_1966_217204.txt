ALLENBY OF ARABIA by Brian Gardner . 314 pages . Coward-McCann. $6.50 . <P> <P> When General Sir Edmund Allenby died at 75 in 1936 , the New York Times composed a reverent fanfare of farewell : " None who held high command will be so long remembered in the English-speaking world . " Yet less than 30 years later , the object of this adulation is remembered only vaguely as a World War I Blimp attached by chance to a much more colorful and important object : Lawrence of Arabia . Such an impression , says Historian Brian Gardner ( The Year That Changed the World : 1945 ) , is ludicrously inadequate . In this sound and vigorous biography , he demonstrates that Allenby was a grand personality and a great general who executed an outstanding military masterpiece in World War I. <P> Born of an obscure Nottinghamshire family , Allenby could nevertheless claim a martial ancestor of distinction : Oliver Cromwell . Still , he joined the army merely by mischance , having previously failed his civil service exams . A big quiet clumsy boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was promptly gazetted to the Inniskilling Dragoons near Durban , South Africa , where he spent the better part of the next 20 years . When the Boer War began , he was 38 and had never fired a shot in anger . When the war was over , he was a tough , cunning , unbeatable commander of cavalry-and a man with a mission . Astounded by the incompetence of his superiors ( " generals with no more brains or backbone than a bran doll " ) , he angrily determined to " put matters right . " He was well equipped for it . At 48 , Allenby was a huge and powerful man with a chest like the hump of Africa and a head like Gibraltar , not to mention a tongue that could flay a rhinoceros . When " the Bull " saw red , battle-hardened officers sometimes fainted dead away . <P> A Free Hand . At the first Battle of Ypres in 1914 , Allenby rallied his demoralized troops by " sheer strength of character " and broke a German attack that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in the summer of 1917 that greatness came looking for Allenby . At first , he wanted to turn it down . Assigned to supreme command of the Middle East , he roared indignantly that he was being " degommered " - demoted . But when the Cabinet promised a free hand and heavy reinforcements , he hit Cairo like a sandstorm-a superbly organized sandstorm . <P> Allenby , in the opinion of many military experts , was the first commander of the 20th century to meet and solve the problems of combined operations on a large scale . Infantry , cavalry , artillery , armor , sea power , air power , guerrilla forces , intelligence units , political possibilities-all the main instruments of modern war were available to other regional commanders of World War I , but Allenby alone , according to the author , had the administrative imagination to employ them in symphony . To orchestrate his strategy , he assembled a staff of geniuses-men like T. E. Lawrence , Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen , Lieut . Colonel Archibald Wavell . Allenby offered these men responsibilities that few other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time he dominated the scene with what Lawrence described as " a mind like the prow of the Mauretania-there is so much weight behind it that it does not need to be sharp .
