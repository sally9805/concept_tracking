txt A lawyer , an investment specialist and a retired railroad executive were appointed today to reorganize the bankrupt New Haven Railroad . Fed'eral Judge Robert P. Anderson , in naming the trustees , warned that if they could not find a solution to the chronic financial plight of the New Haven , it " simply will have to go out of business . " He rejected the Justice Department 's request that he name former Gov . Dennis J. Roberts of Rhode Island as trustee . Instead he chose : Richard J. Smith of Westport , Conn. , senior partner in the New York City law firm of Whitman , Ransom &; Coulson , a former director of the New Haven and a commuter . Harry W. Dorigan of Westfield , N. J. , retired vice president in charge of operations of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and a chief aide to the trustees in the 1935-47 reorganization of the New Haven . William J. Kirk of Newton , Mass. , president of the John P , Chase Company of Boston , investment counselors . I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Interstate Commerce Commission . Late yesterday the I. C. C. had not formally been advised by Judge Anderson of his selections . Normally the commission would receive such a communication by ' mail , Of former Governor Roberts , who led the movement in the 1956 Democratic National Convention to nominate the then Senator John F. Kennedy for Vice President , Judge Anderson said : " I decided not to appoint Mr. Roberts in spite of the weight and consideration I feel is due to a recommendation by the Federal Government , " Mr. Roberts , the judge continued , " undoubtedly has very great ability and skill , " but " his whole life and career is identified with political activity . " " While the aspect of political activity is very valuable , " the judge added , " nonetheless the partisan nature of politics sometimes makes it difficult to give the cooperative effort needed to obtain success in this reorganization . " Judge Anderson said that although there was no public objection to Mr. Roberts ' nomination , there had been previous representations against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees was left open . The judge said that he had not discussed salary with the appointees except that the payment would be left " entirely within the discretion of the court and within the maximum limits to be fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission . " Judge Anderson met later in chambers with the trustees . He said their first assignment would be to apply to the L C. C. for a Government-guaranteed loan of $5,000,000 . The loan , if approved , would be obtained on trustee certificates from commercial banks . Judge Anderson observed that the New Haven was but one of several eastern railroads in financial distress . He said , " Some pattern of survival should be worked out . " The judge made it plain he believed the New Haven faced a fight for survival as a common carrier . Relative to the appeal to the I. C. C. for a loan , he wrote : M " The pending application , and any which may hereafter have to be made , are for funds in the matter of a transfusion to keep the transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit the railroad to stand on its own feet . If ladequate time is not afforded Ito solve these difficult problems or if , in the light of economic circumstances , no way can be found to make income and cost ) operations meet , the New Haven Railroad will simply have to go out of business . " The Court is aware that the trustees can not assure anyone ) of the success of their endeavors . It will need the cooperation of many others . But the Court is of the opinion that , if these individuals , with that cooperation , can not find the solution , it is probable that there is no solution to be found . " Needs in 3 Areas Cited The judge said experts were needed in three areas : financialeconomic , operations , and relations with Federal and state governments . " What is called for , " he said , " is a well-balanced team composed of individuals with appropriate skills ; the technical know-how to operate the New Haven Railroad ; the capacity to formulate new and constructive ideas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The respect and confidence of officers and employes of the New Haven Railroad , customers of the road , governmental officials and the public are also needed , Judge Anderson added . " It must be emphasized , " he said , " that three trustees , rather than a lesser number , are required . The variety and complexity of the problems , the necessity for reaching speedy solutions and the differences in problems of the same general nature as they arise in differlent localities  --  all substantiate the conclusion that it would be beyond the capacity of any less than three . " To appoint one or two , who in turn would be required to depend upon experts in various fields , would destroy the mutuality of contribution on the same level and the effective teamwork which circumstances demand . " The court 's recommendations are subject to review by the full eleven-man membership of the I. C. C. after study by staff members . This study will be undertaken by Vernon Baker , director of the commission 's Finance Bureau . He attended the hearings held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the I. C.
