Last week the vast but thinly populated ( 650,000 ) French territory of Mauritania became the 18th nation to achieve independence this year . Tunisia quickly recognized it , but Morocco refused to , claiming Mauritania as a lost province willfully withheld from it by France . In October Morocco 's fiery Deputy Premier , Crown Prince Moulay Hassan , 31 , flew to Tunis to convince President Habib Bourguiba that he should back the Moroccan claim to Mauritania . Recalls Bourguiba : " The crown prince went so far as to say , ' If ever you want to lay claim to Sicily , we Moroccans will support you . ' Sicily ! Why not Nice and Corsica ? That young man will just have to grow up . "
