Ever since 1960 , the U.S. has been putting an economic squeeze on Communist Cuba with what amounts to an unofficial trade embargo . Free world nations are urged not to do business with Castro , and all vessels in Cuban trade are blacklisted from picking up U.S. Government-financed cargo . So far , 196 vessels are on the forbidden list ; free world trade has skidded from $1.3 billion in 1959 to less than $300 million last year , leaving Castro almost totally dependent on his Iron Curtain friends . But last week Great Britain knocked a hole in the embargo big enough to drive a bus through . <P> In Havana , Britain 's Leyland Motor Co . Ltd. signed up to sell 400 heavy 45-passenger buses for $10 million plus $1,100,000 worth of spare parts . The company gave Castro five years to pay , threw in an option for another 1,000 buses and agreed to train whatever mechanics were needed . To get around the shipping blacklist , Leyland first asked the British government for the loan of an aircraft carrier ; when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freighters would handle the order . <P> Lack of Parts . The deal came as no surprise to the U.S. Government . For months , Cuban trade officials have been shopping with France , West Germany , Spain and Japan for someone to restore the island 's disintegrating transportation system . Havana bus parks are filled with rusting U.S. buses for which no parts are available . In 1962 , Czechoslovakia sent several hundred Skoda buses , but they soon fell victim to Cuba 's tropical weather , its potholed roads and hot-rodding drivers . Of some 1,600 buses operating in Havana in 1961 , only about half are still in service , so few that Cubans go to work packed like cattle into trucks . <P> By itself , the Leyland sale will give Cuba little more than a temporary shot in the arm . Nevertheless , the U.S. was visibly annoyed at the sight of a British company racing to Castro 's rescue . " It certainly does not help in our effort to isolate the Castro regime , " said a State Department official bitterly . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Matter of Surplus . The British seemed to wonder what the U.S. was so upset about . Approved by the government as a straight commercial venture , the sale was treated as if it had no cold war overtones . Leyland had sold hundreds of buses to Cuba before Castro , and was now only resuming relations with an old customer . " I am sorry the U.S. disapproves , " said Leyland 's Managing Director Donald Stokes , " but this is an English company doing a deal with Cuba . I have no knowledge of having to go to America for permission to sell buses . " Besides , if the U.S. expected to sell $300 million worth of wheat to Soviet Russia , it was in no position to complain about a $10 million British sale to Castro . As one Briton dryly put it : " The U.S. has a surplus of wheat-we have a surplus of buses . "
