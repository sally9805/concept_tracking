txt Des Moines , Sept. 14 ? Problems in our cities are linked directly with the problems of rural America , Richard Nixon said here today .

" I feel deeply that the time has come for major improvements in the opportunities and quality of rural life , " said Nixon . " I feel this primarily because it is right for our rural people , especially those trapped in poverty , but also because we can hardly hope to triumph over city problems if the heavy migration from the rural poverty areas into the cities is not stemmed . " Half in Poverty More than half of our citizens below the poverty level live in rural America , farm unemployment is twice as high as city unemployment , and half the nation 's inadequate housing is found in rural areas , Nixon asserted .
