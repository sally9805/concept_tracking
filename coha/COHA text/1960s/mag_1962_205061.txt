Telstar brought the pomp and pageantry , and even a searching closeup of the Pope 's joyful if weary expression . Yet the true awe of last week 's opening of Vatican Council II lay in seeing and sensing the variety , implicit power , and sheer numbers of the bishops , patriarchs and abbots who paraded into St. Peter 's to start history 's biggest religious council . <P> There was Paul Etoga , husky Negro Bishop of Mbalmayo in Cameroun , who had spent all his money on transportation to Rome , and reached the Vatican hungry . There was Pittsburgh 's Bishop John Wright , who many Roman Catholic laymen believe will be the next U.S. cardinal . There was a former fisherman ( Rufino Cardinal Santos of Manila ) and a former count ( Ernesto Sena de Oliveira of Portugal ) . There was Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski , Primate of Communist Poland , who raised a finger to his lips to hush those who were cheering him . There were , in all , 2,700 of them-the spiritual leaders of 500 million people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gilded throne , its white silk canopy glistening in the sun . came Pope John XXIII , who turned from side to side , his right hand constantly blessing the bobbing heads below him . <P> The Missing Bishop . Yet if virtually the whole hierarchy of the church was gathered in St. Peter 's square , there were notable absences . Josef Cardinal Mindszenty languished through his sixth year of asylum in an upstairs room of the U.S. legation in Budapest . No one came from Red China . Only three of Czechoslovakia 's 19 showed up , only 21 of Poland 's 51 . <P> But , in what John XXIII took to be a gesture of better relations between Rome and the Communist world , all of East Germany 's and most of Yugoslavia 's delegations appeared . Lithuania , a country that is mostly Catholic and has been cut off from Rome for years , sent Bishop Petras Mazelis . In the first official contact in five centuries between the Catholic and Orthodox churches , the Orthodox hierarchy in Moscow sent two observers . This break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that church , which had been wavering , much more firm in its decision not to send observers . <P> The Present Protestants . Rather spryly , once he was in St. Peter 's , Pope John climbed to . his throne under Bernini 's baldacchino- " beside St. Peter 's tomb , " as he noted in the speech that he made after the opening religious rites . In careful Latin , he explained to the bishops the purpose of the council .
