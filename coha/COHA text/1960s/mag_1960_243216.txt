Last month Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi called Iran 's legislators to his palace and ordered them to schedule new elections this month . Opposition candidates would be permitted , and the elections were to be completely free . But he explained candidly : " As head of the state , I am above parties , and organizations . If the government is not working properly , even though it has a majority , I can dismiss the government and disband the Majlis . What difference does it make to me who becomes a Deputy ? " <P> Startling as this pronouncement sounded to Western ears , it created little stir among Iranians . For ever since the Shahanshah ousted weepy Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 , he has ruled with an unabashed if benevolent absolutism . To set an example in land reform , he distributed thousands of royal acres to the peasants , set in train such long range developments as dams , roads and irrigation , and has lavished much of the oil revenues of Iran in a buildup of the 200,000-man army . <P> Cause &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring disturbed the Shah and his court . He also vividly remembers the uprising in Iraq which ended with the assassination of King Feisal . There is ample cause for unrest in the Shah 's kingdom , and from across the border , Radio Moscow keeps up a steady drumfire of abuse . In his shabby capital of Teheran , a small portion of the population lives in splendor while the rest exist in the squalor of centuries , washing themselves in the open gutter jubes which double as sewers and water mains . In the arid countryside , the poor scrape the soil at wages of 60 a day while absentee landlords flatly refuse to follow the Shah 's lead in giving up some of their property to the peasants . In recent years the cost of living has risen steadily . The nation 's foreign exchange has been drained dangerously by a government indulgence which lets favored army officers and the country 's rich import luxury goods ranging from Cadillacs to air conditioners . <P> The threat of trouble comes mainly from Iran 's growing body of intellectuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Admiring liberty , they are humiliated by the servility of their Parliament ; taught to respect honesty , they are disgusted by the pall of corruption that hangs over the Shah 's court . Yet the intellectuals are responsible for part of Iran 's plight : they want only the whitest of white-collar jobs and would rather be unemployed lawyers than hard-working engineers . <P> Hope for Safety . There is no country in the Middle East where the stakes are bigger or U.S. involvements as great . For 16 years , a U.S. military mission has been advising and training the Iranian army . <P> U.S. firms , such as David E. Lilienthal 's Development &; Resources Corp. , are building Iranian dams and highways ; more than $1 billion in U.S. economic and military aid has poured into Teheran in the past nine years . Yet an Iranian mission has just asked Washington for an additional loan to balance the badly out of whack Iranian budget , and the military-minded Shah grumbles that he is not getting any supersonic century series jet fighters , even though there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the F-86s he already has .
