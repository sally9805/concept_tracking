txt Blacks who aspire to be commercial airline pilots usually find themselves grounded educationally . Blacks constitute close to 11 percent of the total American population , yet they make up little more than 1/10 of 1 percent of the total number of commercial airline pilots within the continental United States , according to a survey of this nation 's 14 major airlines by The Christian Science Monitor . These airlines employ more than 35,000 pilots . They work as flight engineers ( at about $12,000 a year ) , first officers ( about $25,000 a year ) , and captains ( $40,000 a year ) . Fifty-one of these 35,000 pilots are black , the survey found . Standards defended Three airlines alone employ more than half the black pilots . Trans World Airlines , with 16 , has the largest group , and it expects 20 from its next class . American Airlines ranks second with 10 ; while United Air Lines has 8 . The remaining 17 black pilots fly for Pan American World ? . Airways and Eastern Air Lines ( five each ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ) , and Northeast and Delta Air Lines ( one each ) . So far there are no black pilots flying for Braniff International Airways , Northwest Airlines , Alaska-Airlines , National Airlines , or Trans Caribbean Airways . To qualify for a commercial jetliner , a pilot must have at least two years of college , 1,500 flying hours ( usually in a military jet ) , and preferably be between the ages of 25 and 27 . Approximately one out of every seven regular applicants will qualify . The reasons for these rigid standards vary : ? ? Some airline spokesmen assert that low* // ' ' ' Education and flying requirements limit black pilots // ering ' the qualification standards ( which would allow more blacks to fly ) would also lower their confidence in future pilots . Flying such huge jets , they maintain , is so delicatean operation that , combined with flexibleupilot qualifications , it could lead to future hazards . ? Others say pilot qualifications change according to " supply and demand . " Right now the qualifications are high because there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified pilots goes down , so will the qualifications , they assert . Training comes high But the probability that the number of quilified pilots will decrease , the survey " indicates , is doubtful . With the number of college graduates increasing every year , and with the prospects of avoiding military duty decreasing , it appears that more white Americans than ever will be able to at least meet the necessary qualification standards to become commercial airline pilots , if they so choose . ' ? ? ? Whether this same opportunity will be offered to blacks is questionable , ' however . Several of the airlines pointed out that blacks , in the past , have become entangled in " webs of institutionalism . " Blacks do not qualify for positions as pilots now because few had the opportunity to get the training needed . " This is characteristic of all big-business practices , " one airline official asserted . Beside the age limit , the most important qualification is the 1,500 hours of flying time . Such training cost 's , tens of thousands of dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can meet the huge expenses now required . The airlines do , in fact , get most of their pilots from the military . Although the numbers of black pilots in the Air Force and NaVy , the two service bi'anches which do most military flying , are steadily increasing , they are greatly disproportionate to the number of white military pilots . ' Of 37,000 pilots in the Air Force , only 265 are black . The , Navy , with 18,547 pilots , has only 50 blacks . . ? ? - Educational - barrier Why the low , number ? " Mainly , " charges one black ex-Air Force . officer , " because : until recently flight-train. , . ing. programs in the military were ' off its ' to most blacks . " The requirement for two years of , college alsO lowerS the number of black candidates . Until recently few blacks attended college at all , - and those that did restricted their aspirations to , other fields , such as education and law . The professions , they felt , offered their best chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The airlines maintain- that they would like to hire more black pilots , but where they will find " qualified ones " is a difficult question as long as they continue to draw most of their pilots from the military . It took a seven-year court battle and a Supreme Court decision to force the major airlines to hire black pilots at all . In 1964 , the Supreme Court singled out racial bias as the reason there were no black pilots flying for the major airlines . The court in that year forced Continental Airlines to hire Marlon D. Green , an ex-Air Force officer who had met all the qualification standards but for seven years had been refused a position . Continental claimed Mr. Green forfeited his right to the position when he applied to other airlines and became a cause c ? l ? bre as the leader of a crusade to force airlines to accept blacks for pilot training . The airlines generally are unsure about what they can do to increase the number of " qualified black pilots . " One poteritial solution could be airline-sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " asserts Frank E. Truesdale , assistant dean of Lincoln College in Northeastern University in Boston . Motivation important Lincoln College already has drafted such a program . " It is designed to meet the need of the airlines , " says Dean Truesdale . The program integrates flight training and academic work on a part-time basis . A student takes his academic courses at night and his flight training in the mornings . This leaves him most of the day to work a full-time jbb . The program takes four years to complete . College boards are not required . The only " must " is a high-school diploma . " Give us a student with motivation , even if he barely made it through high school , and we 'll work out a program to get , him through , " asserts Dean Truesdale head of the program . " Even if we have to start him out slower than most , with only a few noncredit courses to begin with eventually , if he 's motivated enough , he 'll make it , " he concludes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Wiggins Airways , in Norwood , Mass . Successful completion of the program leads to an associates degree in flight engineering and a rather inclusive knowledge of commercial-flying techniques . The graduates of the Lincoln College program will not step right into positions with the major airlines , however . " It 's a three step process , " says Dean Truesdale . " We 're the high school , the regional airlines are the colleges , and the major airlines are the graduate schools . " The major airlines , however , do not appear to be interested in programs of this type , according to Dean Truesdale . Asserts one airline official : " It would cost money that we ca n't spend as long as enough qualified pilots are coming in . " First of two articles
