Beauty has never been the exclusive subject of artists , or even their aim . As poets and painters have discovered over the centuries , hell is far more dramatic than heaven . Most painters look with an equal eye on both , as the fancy moves them . But some few , and among them some of the great , have had an ob session for the ugly , and seemed intent on making it uglier . Like T. S. Eliot 's Webster , they always saw the skull be neath the loveliest skin . In a time when many artists have become so detached that they try to banish the figure al together , and sculptors can order their works from the nearest hardware store , a growing number of gifted artists are deeply and emotionally committed to ex pressing their distaste for the world , embodying their rage and resentment in powerful if often ugly images . <P> Many of these new " horror " artists have been well received in gallery exhibitions during the past year or so . Manhattan 's Whitney Museum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of them in the autumn , although Associate Curator Robert Doty does not regard the show as a trend setter . " There 's been a continuous stream of this kind of expressionistic art from the Romanesque period on ward , " says he . " Look at Goya . Look at Bosch . " For that matter , look at Chicago 's Ivan Albright , California 's Edward Kienholz , or New York 's Lucas Samaras . <P> Fantasy Window . One outstanding member of the " new grotesques " is Gregory Gillespie , 32 , a native of New Jersey who now lives in Rome and shows at Manhattan 's Forum Gallery . Gilles pie , who first went to Italy on a Fulbright in 1963 , paints with tempera and oil on wood panels , as did Bellini and Giorgione , and loves Renaissance perspective . He limns tiny images of skinned-looking women or bloated , lecherous men as zestfully as Bosch him self , and sets them against the wall of a squalid Roman slum . Surrealistically oozing globules and pustules contrast with saints ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern version of everyday hell , but it is more than merely nightmare for its own sake . The squalor usually serves to set off the loveliness of some ver dant Tuscan mountain landscape , distantly viewed . Of Exterior Wall with Landscape , he observes , " One might say that the window is the fantasy and the wall is reality . Every idyllic vision is out of the window and far away . " <P> Nancy Grossman , 29 , a petite ( 5 ft. , 95 lbs. ) bundle of compressed fiber , is an other leading member of the new horror school . Her specialty : wooden heads , tightly leather-wrapped . She came to this image when she returned to New York City after the family tried farming in upstate New York . " I noticed how fragile people are . I saw how the human animal has to limit himself to live in our society-how he has to tie up any feelings he has that might upset the applecart. "                @ @ @ @ @
