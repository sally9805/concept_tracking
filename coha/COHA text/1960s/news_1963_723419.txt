txt Letters THOMAS KEATING.MARIA MAXFIELD.JOE BRANDLKURT WEIL.FAYE MANASTER.JENIFER FRA1 Letters FOR CIVIL RIGHTS TO THE EDITOR : Thank you for the symposium of the five Negro leaders , " What the Marchers Really Want " ( Aug. 25 ) . explaining the reason for a civilrights march on Washington . It seems that a revolution that was bound to erupt someday , sometime , some place has found its bursting point . Earlier this summer the racial revolution of Negroes accepted Medgar Evers of Jackson , Miss. , as a martyr . Now the Negro revolution has shaken the entire American society . Notwithstanding the different opinions about this social problem , there are at least two common questions facing each American . Will the principles of liberty and equality apply equally and effectively to every segment of the country 's population ? Will Americans re-examine their individual and collective prejudices , and , after a valid reexamination , will they support a civil-rights program for total integration ? THOMAS KEATtNo . Bradford , Pa . NEGROES ' QUEST To THE EDITOR : Of the opinions expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Baldwin most impressive . He " These youngsters want to learn . " seems to be one of the few people capable of giving a larger frame to the blackwhite question which so troubles the American public now . He is quite right ; America has to learn not only to accept the Negro , but the Outsider in general , white or black . And the truth is that there are more Outsiders now among Negroes than among the white middle-class which now generally dominates politics , business , and the professions . I believe it will be the Negro who will eventually influence American society , with his vitality , his long-trained ability to cope with obstacles , and with his quest for learning , with the value he places upon Is knowledge and intelligence . And this quest for knowledge and intelligence does exist among the American Negroes today . An Outsider myself ; I have for the past few years been living in a slum of East Harlem , by my own free choice , and amid the filth , the ignorance , the crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It teems with youngsters ( my own is growing up among them ) , who have a natural curiosity , an eagerness for knowledge which is almost extinct among the white American middle-class children . I sit in playgrounds and local laundromats and often get nearly mobbed by the children when I start reading a story book . The director of the local public library , one of the few really outstanding librarians in this city , can tell a tale about the Negro children 's quest for learning and her own efforts to keep ahead of their reading appetites , both in quantity and in quality . And this is the heaviest weight the Negro has to throw into the race battle . These are youngsters who want to learn , want to excel , want to be somebody , someday . There is a climate of intellectual growth here , a tremendous power against all the odds and all the misery . And that is what counts . Do we whites have anythinz to offer to equal that ? MARIA M.AXFIELD . New York . ' DINERS ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York 's grand luxe restaurants , " A Critic Along the Escoffier Circuit " ( Sept. 1 ) , Craig Claiborne advances some reasons for the decline in standards . He may have overlooked what could be the underlying reason . In the accelerating debasement of our culture , we see the emergence of a clientage that does not know what to expect In cuisine and service for what it pays . Lacking standards of taste and civility , not knowing what or how to command , our latter-day Trimalehios imagine that to pay high is to buy the guarantees of excellence . They are mistaken . Restaurateurs , like politicians , are all too human , With their customers earning their contempt , we may well expect that these restaurateurs will be tempted to turn their art into a racket . Carl Rose 's excellently satirical drawings are very much to the point : he pictures the suckers as well as " the house . " JOE BRANDI . New York . The author comments : " It is no secret that there are restaurateurs in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogant attitude and feeling of contempt for the Amer ( // Letters // ican palate . Any restaurateur who deliberately diminishes the quality of his product , no matter what sorry estimate he holds for his clientele , is not worthy of the coarse salt he sprinkles on his boiled beef . " ' SAUCE FOR THE . . TO THE EDITOR : Mr. Claiborne 's article on luxury restaurants contains a sketch , to which I must take exception . It shows the bust of the great Escoffier contemplating in horrified disgust a harassed saucier opening up , amongst others , a can of Sauce Diable . It is reasonable to assume that Monsieur 's reaction , had he witnessed such an occurrence , would have been quite the opposite , for he himself produced this and other sauces commercially in Great Britain whence they are being shipped even today to all parts of the world . KURT WEIL . Long Island City , N. Y. The author replies : " Who can speak for the deceased , but it is reasonably certain that M. Escoffier intended those sauces for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants . Mr. Weil may be interested to know that the Escoffier sauces are used by the gallon in one of the city 's most celebrated restaurants , one which , by the by , has lost two executive chefs within the past 18 months . " DEBAR 'S FRENCH To THE EDITOR : Regarding the article " Elephantine Humor " ( Aug. 25 ) in which you presented a sampling of elephant jokes from the book , " The Elephant Book , " I believe an error has been made . In the joke , " What did the elephant say to General de Gaulle ? " the ' answer was , " Nothing , elephants do n't speak French , " which is not true . Elephants do speak French . If you have read " Babar " you would know this . In fact , " Babar " was originally written in French and was translated into English . Babar speaks in the book , so of Babar -- fluent in French . course Babar speaks in French ( so do the other elephants ) . So please pass thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a 12-year-old twin in the eighth grade and would like an elephant . Do you know where I can get one ? Thank you for letting me take up your time . FAYE MA N AsTra . Beverly , Mass . P. S. The author of the Babar series is Laurent de Brunhoff . ' FUNNIER ' FUN TO THE EDITOR : I read in your magazine the " Elephant Jokes " and in my opinion I have two others that are quite a bit funnier . They are : What did Jane say when she saw the elephants coming ? " Here come the blueberries " ( she was color blind ) . Why do some elephants wear blue sneakers ? Their green ones are at the cleaners . Please do n't feel badly about my criticizing your jokes ( some of them are very good ) . I just wanted you to know a typical 11- year - old 's opinion on the matter . JENIEER FRANK . Stamford , Conn , REFORM AND/OR AID TO THE EDITOR : As a frank plea for the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another View of the Latin American Problem " ( Aug. 25 ) may not elicit much sympathy from the public . In this respect , Mr. Davies certainly would have done better pleading for the underdog , as is the fashion . One hopes , however , that at least two general questions his article raises would get the attention their importance warrants . The first question is whether political and economic development are necessarily , or even essentially , consistent processes of modernization . The prevailing assumption  --  rarely openly stated  --  is that they are ; but recent research in transitional societies has tended to weaken it considerably . It has shown that the two kinds of progress are , in effect , frequently at odds . This reappraisal adds plausibility to some doubts Mr. Davies expresses concerning the Alliance for Progress ; it does not , of course , necessarily substantiate his thesis , specifically , that Washington 's desire to link social reform to economic aid is doing more harm than good . The second question , in fact , is precisely whether Washington can do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy - makers there agreed with Mr. Davies , that social reforms must be subordinated to economic growth . This question in turn is full of others : Are social controls not already breaking down , and pressures for leveling , democratizing , wealth - distributing measures not mounting irre ( // Letters // spective of what we do in Latin America ? Can we afford to oppose these pressures when our opponents are certain to support them , and the ruling circles , for whom Mr. Davies pleads , probably not sufficiently strong to effectively control the pressures ? GIL C. ALRoir . Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs , Princeton University . Princeton , N. J. THEY NEED HOPE ' TO THE EDITOR : No one can doubt that we need to encourage economic development , nor the corollary matter of doing all we can to make it possible for the Latin Americans to earn their own way in international trade , nor the call for an " uncommon patience , " nor finally , our humbling limitations . We do need to be reminded , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as indigenous capital is stashed safely away in American and European banks , so long as tax violations are permitted , and business and governments do nothing to encourage new families to become consuming units as rapidly as possible ? all of which would be classed under the social reforms which Mr. Davies would de-emphasize . Mr. Davies and his friends are worried because they see the U.S. getting off the fence on the side of the people . Alliance for Progress administrators are desperately seeking programs that will reach the grassroots ; the Peace Corps is the most effective one yet devised . Our long-range task is to give the people a better hope with greater substance behind it than the Communists are able to do . A realistic hope and a cause in which to utilize their freedom is more important at this juncture than economic development , important as that may be . DANA S. GREEN , Acting Executive Secretary , Committee on Cooperation in Latin America , National Council of the Churches of Christ . New York . ENGINEERS ' note To THE EDITOR : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. T. " ( Aug. 18 ) , David Boroff quotes engineering professors as saying , " The public thinks of engineers as the plumbers of science " ; and " when a space shot goes well it is the scientist 's triumph ; when it goes badly it is the engineer 's failure . " He also says that " 80 per cent of M. I. T. 's students used to be in engineering ; today only 40 per cent are , " and he quotes President Stratton as saying , " I think that if you show students that there are tremendously challenging things in engineering , then the trend can be reversed . " Mr. Boroff 's article uses much of the material that would show this , but unfortunately he fails to show it , because he attributes , as does the public , engineering accomplishments to science . The title of his article focuses attention on science so that the accomplishments he refers to , without attribution to engineering , may fairly be inferred by the reader to be scientific accomplishments . Mr. Boroff 's article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the relationship between engineering and science . Engineering , which in its close ties to satisfying the wants and desires of people is probably even more congenial to the American temperament than science , has suddenly been eclipsed by it in the public mind . JOSEPH H. KEENAN , Professor of Mechanical Engineering , Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Cambridge , Mass . FOREIGN AID To THE EDITOR : David E. Bell 's article " A Reply to the Opponents of Foreign Aid " ( Sept. 1 ) , as well as many of the arguments used by other members of the Administration , point up the fact that proponents of foreign aid always argue in their opponents ' terms . The fact is never faced that United States world leadership is bound to cost money . Also , the fact that it would be our duty to advocate the improvement of the economic situation of the world 's population , even if there were no Communist menace , is rarely stated or is merely tossed in as an afterthought . I believe this country has both the economic capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely out of belief in its own ideals and a desire to lead . ERNEST J. LAVISSIERE . New York . KORAN 'S LESSON TO THE EDITOR : Regarding the letter of Malcolm X , " Muslim Teachings , " Aug. 25 . As a citizen of an Islam country ( Turkey ) , I feel it is my duty to correct Mr. X 's views on the Islam religion . How can the Koran teach the destruction of the blueeyed white men , when half of Islams are whites ? I would advise Mr. X that if he is to interpret the Islam religion to his own liking , he should change the name Islam to a name to suit his own needs . M. ESKICI . New York .
