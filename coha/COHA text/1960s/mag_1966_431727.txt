 | Are Your Tires Safe Enough ? Two-ply tires have been controversial ever since they hit the U.S. market on 1961 cars . Many drivers and tire dealers insist they do n't stand up as well as tires made with four actual layers of cord . Major tire makers , on the other hand , claim the furore is over nothing . People are suspicious of any new product , they say , and point to the ruckus raised when tires changed from six plies to four , and when the tubeless tire was introduced . But while the companies that make newcar tires for Detroit maintain that the twoply tire is as good and in some ways better than the four-ply , not all companies and sales organizations are solidly behind the two-layer shoes . Why is the two-ply/four-ply business , despite the pushing of the major companies , Big difference in construction between two- and four-ply tires is simply the number of layers of cord in the carcass . The picture shows four at bottom , two at top , in cross-section view . 108 POPULAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' design was introduced ? Why do dealers , almost universally among those we queried , still say two-plies ca n't stand up to fours ? Why- is it that although Detroit puts two-plies on new cars , drivers buy fourplies overwhelmingly when replacement time comes ? To get the answers , I talked to all 14 of the country 's tire makers , along with a few independent experts . I watched tire . being tested in laboratories , and participated in road tests . First , let 's take a look at the manufacture and use of two-plies as of this spring . ? More than 90 percent of all new cars coming out of Detroit now wear two-plies . Cadillac changed over this year . Only holdouts are Imperial , Lincoln , and Thunderbird . ? All five major tire companies ? the original-equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) that sell tires to the car makers ? build twoply tires in their first , second , and third lines . But all premium tires and most of their second- and third-line tires are still four-ply , since most replacement-tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Detroit 's new cars , however , are almost all two-ply . ? Five of the country 's smaller tire companies make two-ply tires . But they generally make them in the third line only . They rarely push them . And two-plies account for only a tiny fraction of these companies ' sales . ? Three minor companies once made two-ply tires , but dropped them . One company never made them at all . ? Montgomery Ward , one of the country 's major retailing chains , tried two-plies briefly , but dropped them several years ago . Sears , Roebuck announced that it @#  | was shedding its two-ply tires this winter . To find out what was behind all this , I went calling , and here is the e'idence , and opinions , that I collected : Some tire makers claim that two-plies are at least the equal of four-plies in every respect , and in some ways better . True , the two-ply tire will do the basic job a tire is designed to do . That is , if properly loaded , inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears out without failure of the carcass . And it does give a softer ride . Because it is cooler-running , it may be a better tire for high-speed turnpike driving than a comparable four-ply . But will the two-ply stand day-to-day abuse ? underinflation or overload , for example ? as well as a four-ply tire ? And tires are often run under abusive conditions . The difference . It starts with the basic construction . The four-ply tire has four actual layers of cord in its carcass . What the manufacturers call the four-ply-rated two-ply tire , on the other hand , has two . Akron engineers say that cord content by weight is the same in both . The two-ply gets approximately the same load-carrying capacity by using bigger , stronger cord . The two-ply lacks no defenders . " Heat buildup is what destroys a tire , " says Joseph F. Hutchinson , manager of auto-tire engineering at Goodyear . " A twoply tire has fewer flexing parts , and can run as much as 15 degrees cooler . You also get less hysteresis ? that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently you use less gasoline . " Tire men also point out that the greater flexibility allows the tire to conform slightly better to the road surface , giving better traction and skid resistance . The ride is better ? that 's particularly important to Detroit . Finally , most experts agree that twoply tires last as long as four-plies . Generally , two-ply tires do not show up as well on some tests of carcass strength and resistance to force as do four-plies . " If you force a plunger into a tire , " concedes senior field engineer Jim Corey e : Firestone. " the distance it goes into th tire and the load required to force it into the tread develop an energy figure . And with two-ph construction , the energ. yield will be somewhat lower than witl four-ply construction .

A r figure in each four-ply , running under identical conards of a single ditions on same car , went 125 miles trands. without an outright failure .  | publish the results is the nonprofit Motor Vehicle Research laboratory of Lee , N.H. In a series of tests , this organization slowly inflated several hundred two- and four-ply tires made by various manufacturers until they burst . Although there were variations , the fourply tires tended to burst at between 200 and 300 pounds pressure . Two-ply tires for the most part blew at 170 to 200 . Some manufacturers said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained in their own laboratories . " That 's about right , " said Corey . " There is some strength difference between a two-ply and a four-ply tire , " say s Tom Young of B.F. Goodrich . Some manufacturers ? Goodyear , for example ? deny such differences , at least for their own products . Are burst-strength variations important ? " Yes , " says Andrew j . White , director of IVR . Most tire manufacturers disagree . " Any tire test taken by itself is just one f actor of many , " says J. J. Hartz , manager of tire engineering for Goodyear . " It can be extremely deceiving , " adds Corev of Firestone . " You 're testing only one smell segment of a complex system . " In fact . " says Corey , " we test our tires on a rough , twisting , rocky road through the Davis Mountains of West Texas . And the two-ply tires , despite somewhat lower burst-pressure figures , show better durability than four ' - plies put through the same course , where impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to cut , " says Hutchinson of Goodyear . " When you run over a sharp object , the tire just folds out of the way . " J. J. Robson , Firestone director of tire development , estimates that the two-ply absorbs 20 percent more shock force than a four-ply . The evidence I have seen indicates that performance two-ply and four-ply tires is not identical , particularly under abuse . Parking-lot surveys and other studies show that many car owners run their tires seriously underinflated . The load-carrying ability of a tire , of course , varies with pressure . If pressure drops sharply below normal , the tire becomes seriously overloaded and subject to early failure . But do two- and tires show differences in the failure pressure drops ? Will it last ? One design critical of any tire is that it be built to nun long to wear out the tread before tits , fails . Properly maintained will , undoubtedly , normally meet But MVR tests seem to show tires fail quicker than four-plies sive conditions . Most tire makers quarrel elusion , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe u " If underinflation is the Young of Goodrich , " there s significant difference . " " Two-plies can take more punishment  | of that kind because they are more flexible , " says Goodyear 's Hutchinson . Firestone 's Corey reflects a different point of view . " Flex breaks in two-ply tires were a problem , " he says . " But that problem is pretty well over the hill now for most manufacturers . " Since there is so little agreement on the vulnerability of abused tires , I accepted an invitation from MVR to observe and participate in tests , both under lab conditions and in vehicles on the road . Road testing . The first test involved mounting four first-line 6.70-by-15 tires made by one of the OEM companies on the back of a test vehicle , one at a time . Two of the tires were four-ply-rated twoply . The others were four-ply . Loading was adjusted to 100 percent of the rating as given by the Tire and Rim Association , and all the tires were inflated to 24 pounds and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed . Running on a dynamometer puts a terrific strain on a tire . The tire rests on two relatively small rollers , which flex it sharply at two points . The tire flexes as it turns far more than if it were on a flat surface . The two four-ply tires ran for 56 and 91 minutes before the sidewalls blew near the curb guard . The two-plies went only 38 and 44 minutes . We next drove into the parking lot of a distributor of another major brand of tires and had two new first-line 7.65-by14 tires mounted on the front wheels of our test car ; one was a four-ply-rated tire , the other a four-ply . Front-wheel was 815 pounds for each t , The temperature outside was 337 3 Tires were inflated to a recommended 24 pounds . After five miles at 50 m.p.h. we reduced pressure to 20 pounds . after another five miles to 15 , then to 10. : 7 ing each time with a large , laboratory calibrated air-pressure gauge . At 20 air was bled off until the pressu eight pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracking or other age on the outer walls . Pressure had to nine pounds , and we bled off air both tires read six pounds hot . Just under four miles later , the car a sharp lurch to the right . A hole opened in the sidewall of the two-pyl , We removed and inspected it . The were separated and clearly visible . from the inside and ouside in the v of the break . The inside of the tire tamed a handful of chewed-up inner The four-ply tire measured an incredible 232 pounds of air . Nevertheless . another 46.9 miles , running at 30 an hour , the tire had still not failed . took it off to inspect it . There were small cracks in the inner liner at splice and the tire was badly off cc- but there were no other signs of dai : Running six tires to destruction ? : - on the dynamometer and two on the n does not prove a case . Only two man : :  | turers were represented . Tires of othercould have had different characteristics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy ? access to adjustment records of . the tire manufacturers . Unfortunately , adjustment figures . for competitive reasons , are secret . But some companies will talk in general terms . Goodyear states that two-plies give no more , and sometimes less , trouble than four-plies . Firestone goes further . " Our adjustment records show , " says Corey , " that our experience has been a little better with two-plies than with four-plies . We particularly get fewer impact adjustments from two-plies . " Only one of the country 's 14 tire makers ? who , for obvious reasons , prefers not to be named ? gives a different account . " Frankly , " says a spokesman , " it was adjustments on two-ply tires that forced us out of them . We thought we were making as good a two-ply as could be made . But they just did n't stand up as well . " How does the evidence add up ? Unfortunately , somewhat inconclusively : 1 . Two-ply tires have certain engineering advantages . They run cooler , ride softer . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by burst tests , two-plies generally have less carcass strength than four-plies . However , there is little hard evidence that this affects performance . 3 . Limited evidence indicates that twoply tires are more sensitive to underinflation . The tire companies deny this . Their account of their adjustment experience tends to support them . 4 . For all tires , underinflation may he more dangerous than commonly thought . The moral is : Keep your tire pressures up to recommendation . Overload is more common than is realized . Instruction books and in some cases windshield stickers on 1966 cars are specifying that pressure should be increased for a full load ? say , six persons and baggage . A normal load , for which the generally recommended 24 pounds is adequate , is usually calculated on the basis of three to five persons and no baggage . The swing toward two-ply tires is n't likely to be stopped . Detroit prefers them . More than nine out of every 10 cars coming off the assembly lines wear two-layer shoes . Even the replacement market is corning around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
