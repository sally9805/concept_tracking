txt President Kennedy 's medicare plan , embodied in the King-Anderson bill , is a wasteful , extravagant , and unnecessary program , unsound in principle , and unwise in conception , the president of the American Medical association charged yesterday . Dr. George M. Fister of Ogden , Utah , said in a statement that the 1963 measure is not basically different from the one that was defeated in Congress last year . " It remains a program to force higher social security payroll taxes on workers and employers to finance a compulsory , regimented system of government hospitalization for virtually all citizens over the age of 65 , regardless of their need , rich and poor alike , " he said . Mislabeled , He Says And the proposed legislation is mislabeled by being given the title of the hospital insurance act of 1963 , the medical leader said . " The authors of this bill have borrowed the trusted name of insurance to lend a tone of respectability to a tax program the country has so far been unwilling to buy , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be paying premiums on hospital insurance , with their money set aside for their own future benefit . " Deception can be carried only so far , however - in this case about 50 of the bill 's 75 pages . On page 50 it is disclosed that the money collected under this program would not be set aside for the taxpayer 's future , but would be deposited into the general federal treasury , and the so-called ' federal hospital insurance trust fund ' would be kept solvent only by appropriations from the general treasury . Serves as Middleman " This fund in fact would serve primarily as a middleman passilg on money from the treasury to program beneficiaries . " The deception is further exposed in later sections of the bill where it proposes to adjust revenue clauses of the social security act to accommodate the King-Anderson hospital program . Revenues are defined as taxes ' imposed on the income ' of workers and excise taxes levied on employers . The words ' insurance premiums ' are not be be found in the bill . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wasteful but " unpredictably expensive . " " Beginning in 1965 , the KingAnderson bill would increase payroll taxes about 16 per cent by raising the tax rate onequarter of 1 per cent on workers and employers alike and by increasing the taxable wage base from $4,800 to $5,200 . The self-employed would also pay extra , " he said . Deduct $27.50 More " Every worker earning $100 a week or more ? and more than 50 per cent do ? would pay an additional tax of $27.50 a year matched by his employer . The maximum tax is now $174 annually on the worker and a like amount on the employe r . If King-Anderson were enacted , this tax would climb to $201.50 in 1965 . " By 1966 , when another social security tax increase that is already scheduled takes effect , the $100-a-week employe would be paying 30 per cent more social security tax than he pays today . In 1968 , when yet another boost will take effect , he would pay nearly 46 per cent more . " The total cost of providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to virtually all the aged , regardless of need , is anybody 's guess . " And it is evident from statements by administration spokesmen , taken together with provisions of the bill , that they are in a deep fog about the cost . President Kennedy , for example , has stated that the cost would be 1.1 billion dollars a year for the first five years . " The department of health , education , and welfare has said that one out of every six people more than 65 is hospitalized each year . If this is true , by 1965 when the bill would become effective , one-sixth of the 18 million people who will then be 65 will be hospitalized during the year , or a total of 3 million . " Sponsors of the bill also have said that the average length of hospitalization for the aged is about 15 days . A section of the new bill proclaims that by 1965 , the average daily cost of hospitalization will be $37 . More than Estimate " When all these statistics are put together - 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an average cost of $37 a day ? the total price of this program for hospitalization alone would bo 1.665 billion dollars , or 50 per cent more than President Kennedy estimated for the entire program of hospitalization , nursing home care , home nursing caro , and diagnostic services . Dr. Fister then made his indictment of the program , callIng it wasteful , extravagant and unnecessary , unsound in principal and unwise in conception which " would not make much sense from an economic standpoint at any time . " " Its approval would be a particular act of folly at this time when the President is demanding a three-year , 10 billion dollar tax cut to spur the economy , " he said . " In three years , the King-Anderson program would cost nearly 5 billion dollars on the basis of the administration 's own figures . Insurance actuaries estimate the cost would be twice as much as the administration predicts . " But if the cost of this scheme can not be predicted , its danger to the practice of medicine and the administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical association and other organizations have repeatedly warned that legislation of this kind would enthrone the secretary of health , education , and welfare as the czar over the nation 's hospitals , granting him the power to interfere with and regulate medical practice in these institutions . " The warning raised anguished cries in Washington that no one either coveted or would exercise such power . " Yet the authority was clear and explicit in last year 's KingAnderson bill , asserting that no government official or employe could interfere with medical practice or hospital administration ' except as otherwise provided ' in the bill . The exceptions were numerous . Attempt to Suppress It " Administration draftsmen of this year 's bill have attempted by word weaponry to suppress this criticism . Their studious phrasing , however , has been successful only in erecting a semantic camouflage . The secretary 's power to regulate and control would not be diminished by careful selection of words . Indeed , it could not be . " The authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing the administration of a federal program involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this legislation , and the regulations the secretary decided to impose would have the force of law . " Control lies at the heart of this legislation . If the secretary were not satisfied with the performance of anyone connected with the program , ho could tighten the purse strings . Question of Judgment " Who can say that the exercise of such authority would not at some time in some hospital effectively thwart the medical judgment of an elderly patient 's own physician ? " Significantly , the patient 's personal physician is accorded no positive consideration under any sentence or clause or section of this bill . In only one respect is he even mentioned ? he has to be notified and be given opportunity for consultation when a decision is made that one of his patients is to be removed from the hospital ! " Dr. Fister said the bill 's power " to meddle , to control , is clear ; the threat to the practice of medicine and the administration of hospitals is obvious . It is equally certain that the quality of medical care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's choice of a nursing home would be restricted , the A. M. A. president said , " because only those nursing homes controled or affiliated I with a hospital could qualify under the terms of the bill . " Senate debate last year revealed that of some 20,000 nursing homes in the country , only about 500 meet this specification . In Illinois , according to a recent survey conducted by the bureau of hospitals of the department of public health , only 44 out of 240 general hospitals in the state own , control , or are affiliated with a nursing home . " How much freedom of choice would more than a million people more than 65 in Illinois have under these circum-stances ? " Dr. Fisher said he believed that millions of Americans over 65 years old who are self-reliant and independent would resent implications contained in the prologue of the King-Anderson bill " which seeks to portray the aged as a separate class of citizens , all alike , universally impoverished and in poor health , whose only salvation lies in the paternalism of the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asserts that most of the aged can not afford private health insurance ' adequately protecting t h e in ' against the cost of hospitalization , " he said . " What is or is not adequate , however , is a matter of individual circumstance and choice and can not be generalized . " The fact is that more than 9.5 million people over 65 carry hospitalization insurance , and the total represents nearly 70 per cent of all aged who either need or want it . It is also a fact that King-Anderson would cover less than 25 per cent of the average elderly person 's health care needs . " Also ignored are numerous surveys that show what many older citizens are proud to admit -- that In general they are at least economically as well off as younger people and generally enjoy good health .
