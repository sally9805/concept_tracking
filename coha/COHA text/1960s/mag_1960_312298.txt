Out of Vanderbilt University 's new $1,300,000 divinity school last week marched Dean J. Robert Nelson on a grim mission of conscience . He strode across the Nashville campus and handed Chancellor Harvie Branscomb a terse letter of resignation . By week 's end ten other divinity-school faculty members followed Nelson , 17 students quit , and three recent graduates returned their diplomas . It was the worst ruckus in Vanderbilt 's 87-year history . <P> At issue was the expulsion last March of a Negro divinity-school student , chunky , spectacled James M. Lawson Jr . A Methodist minister , the Rev. Mr. Lawson , 32 , was fired after leading sit-in strikers during Nashville 's lunch-counter demonstrations . For Dean Nelson and his colleagues . Lawson " came to symbolize a great set of principles-freedom of action , freedom of conscience , the nature of a university and the struggle of the Negro for his rights . " <P> Obey the Law . An advocate of militant passive resistance against segregation . Pennsylvania-born Lawson is the son of a Methodist minister . He served a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in I ndia as a missionary and avid student of Gandhi 's techniques of nonviolence ( " Gandhi helped me to see the Christian life " ) . To earn a bachelor of divinity degree , he entered Vanderbilt in 1958 , organized Negro students on the side . <P> Ironically , Vanderbilt is one of the South 's most integrated campuses . A Southern liberal , Chancellor Branscomb persuaded his conservative board of trust to admit Negroes in 1953 , and he is personally sympathetic to the sit-in strikers ' goals . But " civil disobedience ' ' is something else again . Branscomb firmly believes that whites and Negroes must equally obey the law-or face race riots . And at the height of the sit-in tension , Lawson told city officials : " The law has been a gimmick to manipulate the Negro . " <P> On to Boston . Asked to explain whether he was encouraging Negroes to " violate the law , " Lawson told Branscomb : " When the Christian considers the concept of civil disobedience as an aspect of nonviolence , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency which in reality has ceased to be the law . " Unable to accept this reasoning . Branscomb asked Lawson to leave Vanderbilt . He refused-and Branscomb expelled him . <P> One-quarter of the university faculty ( 112 professors ) signed a petition supporting Lawson . When he was arrested for conspiracy to restrain trade and commerce , the divinity-school faculty chipped in $500 for bail . The faculty stirred such a fuss that Dean Nelson set about readmitting Lawson . But last week Chancellor Branscomb vetoed the idea , and Nelson quit .
