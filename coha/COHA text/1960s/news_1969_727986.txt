txt Declaring that New York City has " no viable local solution " to its financial problems , Mayor Lindsay has asked the Federal Government to develop a revenuesharing plan that would emphasize aid to the cities . In a position paper circulating in the Nixon Administration , Mr. Lindsay has proposed that the Government next year distribute about $5-billion among the states in proportion to the tax revenues raised by the state and local governments themselves . A Federal tax increase to finance the aid is neither embodied in nor ruled out of the Mayor 's plan , which stresses rather the nation 's economic growth and a corresponding ability to meet urban needs . The $5-billion In aid would amount to 1.5 per cent of personal income that is taxable under the Federal income tax laws . The Mayor 's proposal calls for increasing this amount by 0.5 of a percentage point each year until 5 per cent of the income-tax base was turned over to the states and localities by 1977 . An Administration study group is putting together a revenue-sharing plan , and President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antipoverty programs and revenue-sharing in a nationally televised address next Friday . Under the formula proposed by Mr. Lindsay , New York State , with 9 per cent of the nation 's population , would receive 13.1 per cent of the Federal funds , or $596.1-million in the first year of the revenuesharing program . Of this , $268. - 2-million would be passed on automatically to New York City . The Mayor 's paper did not calculate the aid in future years . New York City currently receives 15.9 per cent , or a little more than $1-billion of its $6.6-billion budget , from the Federal Government . This aid . is earmarked for specific purposes . but the new aid sought by the Mayor could be used for any ' , purpose the city wanted . The Lindsay plan for Federal revenue-sharing is similar to his proposal for Urbanaid , which was offered to and ignored by the State Legislature in each of the last three sessions : Under Urbanaid , the state would give a percentage of its income-tax receipts to local governments , with the ratio determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . This money would be in addition to the aid already given to the city - by the state . " The focus of any Federal revenue-sharing plan must be on the cities , " Mr. Lindsay said in the paper . " Many , probably most , of our major cities , are approaching financial collapse . Taxing powers are close to , exhaustion . Expenditures are rising at a rate two or three times the increase in revenues . The pressure to satisfy unmet needs is urgent ? and a genuinely explosive situation is worsening . " Mayor Lindsay said that city budget officials had been developing four-year cost projections for the city , and added : " It appeals from our analyses that , in order to continue existing services , the city must find $1.5-billion to $2-billion in new annual revenues . There simply is no viable local solution to this dilemma . " Mr. Lindsay called his revenue-sharing proposal the RETURN plan , standing for " Revenue Equalization for Total Urban and Rural Needs . " He said that any plan proposed by the Administration should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments make to raise their own tax revenues . In other words , states and localities that tax more , proportionately , than others would receive the greater share of the Federal funds , under the Mayor 's proposal . Such a proposal presumably would draw opposition from officials and Congressmen from areas with lower " tax effort . " Mr. Lindsay also said that the cities should be guaranteed share of the funds either through a mandatory " passthrough " procedure , requiring each state to distribute to the localities a specified part of the money it received from the Federal Government ; Administration officials reportedly have reached an informal agreement on the socalled " pass through " . procedure so that the cities would get their guaranteed share of the Federal funds ' turned back to the states . Under Mr. Lindsay 's proposed formula , New York State 's share . of the funds received from the Federal Government would be 41.5 per cent , with 58.5 per cent of the funds going to local governments . The Mayor said the city was prepared to accept some variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how the state and local governments could use the Federal money . " If a primary purpose of revenue-sharing is to return money to where the problems are , it would be inconsistent to limit the uses of the funds , " he said . Mr. Lindsay said that the Federal Government would serve its own fiscal interests if it tried to meet local fiscal needs through revenue-sharing . Otherwise , he said , " if the ominous indications of the cities ' imminent financial collapse are correct , the Federal Government will inevitably be forced to pick up the pieces .
