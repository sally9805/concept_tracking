txt Fearful that their bickering might have endangered the $1.75-billion antipoverty bill , Democrats sought to close ranks today as the embattled measure reached the House floor . Whatever wounds were opened by the House Education and Labor Committee 's revolt last week against its chairman , Representative Adam Clayton Powell , were carefully hidden . " On this side , " Mr. Powell said with a flourish , - amid laughter rand applause , " we are in complete unanimity . " Much of the job of managing the bill on the floor will be handled by Representative Sam M. Gibbons , the Florida Democrat who initiated the committee revolt that stripped Mr. Powell of much of his powers . Mr. Gibbons had been chosen by the Manhattan Democrat to manage the bill some months ago , but was abruptly dismissed by the chairman when his role in the committee coup became known . Powell Praises Work Without officially " rehiring " Mr. Gibbons as floor manager , Mr. Powell heaped praise on him today for his " yeoman work . " And it was Mr. Gibbons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening debate . The debate may last all week . Democratic leaders hope for a final vote by Thursday night , but Republicans are predicting that debate , will continue through Friday , possibly even Saturday . The Senate Labor Committee approved a $2,496,000,000 bill last Thursday , some $746,000,000 more than President Johnson had asked . Senator Joseph S. Clark , the Pennsylvania Democrat who will serve as floor manager for the measure , has expressed concern that the excess might cause him trouble on the final vote . One of the most controversial bills to reach the floor this year , the measure was denounced today by Republicans as a " multibillion-dollar boona:loggle " that is mired in politics . Representative William H. Ayres of Ohio , ranking minority member on the Powell committee , told the House that the antipoverty program " was conceived // in politics a few months before the 1964 election and it has been mired in politics , ever since . " The antipoverty campaign , he said , " is a war of the politicians , by the politicians and for the politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was planned that way , " he added . Reply - by McCormack House Speaker John ' W. McCormack , who rarely takes part in debate , leaped to his feet . The antipoverty program , the Speaker protested , was not conceived in politics . It was " conceived out of human considera-I tion for millions of our unfortunate fellow citizens . " In the days to come , Republicans plan to pepper the bill with amendments , variously estimated from 50 to 114 . One Republican proposal would require states and local governments to pay about $750-million of the 51.75-billion program . Republicans also will seek to strip the Office of Economic Opportunity , headed by Sargent Shriver , of key parts of the program by placing educational programs in the Office of Education and labor programs in the Labor Department . The Republicans would leave Mr. Shriver 's agency only the Domestic Peace Corps , Volunteers in Service to America , and some parts of the present Community Action Program . Defending the committee 's bill again Republican charges that it was a rubber stamp for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not an Administration bill . It 's not by a long shot what came to us from the agencies . " Emphasis Shfited Although the committee authorize ? the full $1.75-billion sought by the White House , it shifted emphasis from some programs that have been under fire to those that have been more widely praised . For instance , the committee earmarked $400-million for the popular Neighborhood Youth Corps , thus cutting back funds for the much criticized Job Corps camps and centers . The committee also earmarked $352-million for Project Head Start , a program of preschool training , thus cutting back funds for Community Action Programs . Despite the bitterness of the opening debate , there was a lighter side . . Republicans laughed raucously and Democrats chuckled when Representative Silvio 0 . Conte , Republican of Massachusetts , noted that Mr. Powell had left the floor during Mr. Ayres 's speech . Demanding a quorum call , Mr. Conte grinned and said : " I think the , chairman of the committee should be here to hear his good friend speak . " Scarcely seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the chamber , bowed from the waist and resumed his seat . At another point , while Republicans were criticizing the handling of the antipoverty program , Representative Hugh L. Carey , Democrat of Brooklyn , jumped up and suggested that Mr. Shriver 's agency " must be producing some pretty good graduates . " Every time the Shriver agency trains a good man , Mr. Carey said , New York 's Republican Mayor Lindsay " hires them to work up there . "
