" " Would my great ancestors be proud to know they produced a goddam grocery clerk in a goddam wop store in a town they used to own ? " " You are not . You 're more like the manager , keep the books and bank the money and order the goods . " " Sure .

" I feel good , " he said . " Why do they call it Good Fri-day ? " " Spring , " she said from the stove . " Spring Friday ? " " Spring fever . Is that the children up ? " " Fat chance . Lazy little bastards . Let 's get ' em up and whip ' em . " " You talk terrible when you 're silly . Will you come home twelve to three ? " " Nope . " " Why not ? " " Women . Sneak ' em in .

You know you do . " " Farewell , oh ship of state , " he said , and slammed the screen door after him and went out into the green-gold morning . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and his great-grandfather 's , white-painted shiplap with a fanlight over the front door , and Adam decorations and a widow 's walk on the roof . It was deep-set in the greening garden among lilacs a hundred years old , thick as your waist , and swelling with buds . The elms of Elm Street joined their tops and yellowed out in new-coming leaf . The sun had just cleared the bank building and flashed on the silvery gas tower , starting the kelp and salt smell from the old harbor . Only one person in early Elm Street , Mr. Baker 's red setter , the banker 's dog , Red Baker , who moved with slow dignity , pausing occasionally to sniff the passenger list on the elm trunks . " Good morning , sir . My name is Ethan Allen Hawley . I 've met you in pissing . " Red Baker stopped and ackpowledged the greeting , with a slow sway of his plumed tail . Ethan said , " I was just looking at my house . They knew how to build in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hind foot to kick casually at his ribs . " And why not ? They had the money . Whale oil from the seven seas , and spermaceti . Do you know what spermaceti is ? " Red gave a whining sigh . " I see you do n't . A light , lovely rose-smelling oil from the head cavity of the sperm whale . Read Moby Dick , dog . That 's my advice to you . " The setter lifted his leg on the cast-iron hitching post at the gutter .  | Turning to walk away , Ethan said over his shoulder , " And make a book report . You might teach my son . He ca n't even spell spermaceti , or  --  or anything . " Elm Street runs at an angle into High Street two blocks from the old Ethan Allen Hawley house . Halfway down the first block a delinquent gang of English sparrows were fighting on the new-coming lawn of the Elgar house , not playing but rolling and picking and eye-gouging with such ferocity and so noisily that they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Birds in their little nests agree , " he said . " So why ca n't we ? Now there 's a bunch of horse crap for you . You kids ca n't get along even on a pretty morning . And you 're the bastards Saint Francis was nice to . Screw ! " He ran at them , kicking ; " arid tie sparrows rose-With a whispered roar of wings , complaining bitterly in door-squeak voices . " Let me tell you this , " Ethan said after them . " At noon the sun will darken and a blackness will fall on the earth and you will be afraid . " He came back to the sidewalk and proceeded on his way . The old Phillips house in the second block is a boarding house now . Joey Morphy , teller at the First National , came out of the front door . He picked his teeth and straightened his Tattersall waistcoat and said , " Hi , " to Ethan . " I was just going to call on you , Mr. Hawley , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday ? " " It 's m. . he T , at.ua , . ; .. , Joey . m " Goodus.t goodilius , goodum , meanilo , y . " Joey looked like a horse and he smiled like a horse , raising a long upper lip to show big square teeth . Joseph Patrick Morphy , Joey Morphy , Joey-boy ? " the Morph " ? a real popular guy for one only a few years at New Baytown . A joker who got off his gags veily-eyed like a poker player , but he whinnied at other people 's jokes , whether or not he had heard them . A wise guy , the Morph , had the inside dope on everything  --  and everybody from  | Mafia to Mountbatten  --  but he gave it out with a rising inflection , almost like a question . That took the smart-aleck tone out of it , made his listener a party to it so that he could repeat it as his own . Joey was a fascinating monkey ? a gambler but no one ever saw him lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teller . Mr. Baker , First National president , trusted Joey so completely that he let the teller do most of the work . The Morph knew everyone intimately and never used a first name . Ethan was Mr. Hawley . Margie Young-Hunt was Mrs. Young-Hunt to Joey , even though it was whispered that he was laying her . He had no family , no connections , lived alone in two rooms and private bath in the old Phillips house , ate most of his meals at the Foremaster Grill and Bar . His banking past was known to Mr. Baker and the bonding company and it was immaculate , but Joey-boy had a way of telling things that had happened to someone else in a way that made you suspect they had happened to Joey , and if that was so , he had really been around . Not taking credit made people like him even more . He kept his fingernails very clean , dressed well and sharply , and always had a clean shirt and a shoeshine . The two men strolled together down Elm Street toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You related to Admiral Hawley ? " " Do n't you mean Admiral Halsey ? " Ethan asked . " We 've had lots of captains but I never heard of an admiral in the family . " " I heard your granddad was a whaling captain . Kind of connected up in my mind with the admiral , I guess . " " Town like this has got myths , " said Ethan . " Like they say people on my dad 's side did some pirating way back and my mother 's family came over in the Mayflower . " " Ethan Allen , " Joey said . " My God  --  you related to him too ? "  | " Might be . Must be , " said Ethan . " What a day  --  ever see a prettier ? ' What was it you wanted to see me about ? " " Oh , yes . I guess you 're closing the store twelve to three . Would you make me a couple of sandwiches about half past eleven ? I 'll run in and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank 's not closing ? " " Bank is . I 'm not . Little Joey 'll be right in there , chained to the books . Big weekend like this  --  everybody and his dog cashing checks . " " I never thought of that , " said Ethan . " Oh , sure . Easter , Memorial Day , Fourth of July , Labor Day  --  any long weekend . If I wanted to stick up a bank , I 'd do it just before a long weekend . The stuff 's right there all laid out , waiting . " " You ever get stuck up , Joey ? " " No . But I had a friend that did twice . " " What did he say about it ? " " Said he was scared . Just took orders . Laid down on the floor and let ' em have it . Said the money was better insured than he was . " " I 'll bring you the sandwiches when I close up . I 'll knock on the back door . What kind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll slip across the alley  --  one ham and one cheese on rye , lettuce and mayonnaise , and maybe one bottle of milk and a Coke for later . " " Got some nice salami  --  that 's Marullo . " " No , thanks . How 's the one-man Mafia holding up ? " " All right , I guess . " " Well , even if you do n't like guineas , you got to admire a guy can build a pushcart into all the property he owns . He 's pretty cute . People do n't know how much he 's got salted away . Maybe I should n't say that . Banker 's not supposed to tell . " " You did n't tell . " They had come to the corner where Elm angles into High Street . Automatically they stopped and turned to look  | at the pink brick and plaster mess that was the old Bay Hotel , now being wrecked to make room for the new Woolworth 's . The yellow-painted bulldozer and the big crane that swung the wrecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I always wanted to do that , " Joey said . " Must be a kick to swing that steel ball and see a wall go down . " " I saw enough go down in France , " Ethan said . " Yeah ! Your name 's on the monument down by the waterfront . " " Did they ever catch the robbers that stuck up your friend ? " Ethan was sure the friend was Joey himself . Anyone would have been . " Oh , sure . Caught ' em like mice . It 's lucky robbers are n't smart . If Joey-boy wrote a book how to rob a bank , the cops would never catch anybody . " Ethan laughed . " How 'd you go about it ? " " I got a pipeline , Mr. Hawley . I just read the papers . And I used to know a guy pretty well was a cop . You want the two-dollar lecture ? " " ' Bout six bits ' worth . I 've got to open the store . " " Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here this morning ? No , look ! How do they catch bank robbers ? Number one  --  record , got caught before . Number two  --  get fighting over the profits and someone blows it . Number three ? dames . Ca n't let dames alone , and that ties into number four  --  they got to spend that money . Watch new spenders and you got them . " " So what 's your method , professor , sir ? " " Simple as socks . Everything opposite . Never rob a bank if you ever got caught or booked for anything . No confederates  --  do it alone and do n't tell a soul , nobody . Forget dames . And do n't spend it . Put it away , maybe for years . Then when you 've got some excuse for having some money , bring it out a little at a time and invest . Do n't spend . " " How about if the robber got recognized ? "  | " If he covers his face and do n't talk , who 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're nuts . My cop friend says sometimes when they 'd plant him in the line-up , he got picked out over and over again . People swore their eyes out he did whatever it was . That 'll be six bits , please . " Ethan put his hand in his pocket . " I 'll have to owe you . " " I 'll take it out in sandwiches , " said Joey . The two crossed High Street and entered the alley that right-angled from the other side . Joey went in the back door of the First National Bank on his side of the alley , and Ethan unlocked the alley door of Marullo 's Fruit and Fancy Groceries on his side . " Ham and cheese ? " he called . " On rye  --  lettuce and mayonnaise . " A little light , grayed by the dusty iron-barred window , came into the storeroom from the narrow alley . Ethan paused in the twilight place shelved to the ceiling and stacked with the cartons and wooden cases of canned fruits , vegetables , fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice among the seminal smells of flour and dried beans and peas , the paper-and-ink odor of boxed cereals , thick rich sourness of cheeses , and sausage , reek of hams and bacon , ferment of cabbage trimmings , lettuce , and beet tops from the silvery garbage cans beside the back door . Perceiving no rusty must of mouse , he opened the alley door again and rolled the covered garbage cans into the alley . A gray cat darted to get in , but he drove it away . " No , you do n't , " he remarked to the cat . " Mice and rats are fee for cats , but you 're a sausage nibbler . Aroint ! You hear me  --  aroint ! " The seated cat was licking a curled pink paw but at the second " aroint " he hightailed away and scrambled over the board fence behind the bank . " That must be a magic word , " Ethan said aloud . He returned to the storeroom and closed the door after him . Now through the dusty room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubicle of the toilet he heard the whis- pering of seeping water . He opened the plywood door , switched on the light , and flushed the toilet . Then he pushed open the wide door with wire-netted glass peekhole and wedged it open , kicking the wood block firmly in with his toe . The store was greeny from the drawn shades over the big front windows . Again shelves to the ceiling , filled neatly with gleaming canned and glassed foods , a library for the stomach . On one side  --  counter , cash register , bags , string , and that glory in stainless steel and white enamel , the cold cabinet , in which the compressor whispered to itself . Ethan flipped a switch and flooded the cold cuts , cheeses , sausage , chops , steaks , and fish with a cold bluish neon glare . A reflected cathedral light filled the store , a diffused cathedral light like that of Chartres . Ethan paused to admire it , the organ pipes of canned tomatoes , the chapels of mustard and olives , the hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he intoned in a nasal litanic tone . " Uni unimouse quod unibug in omnem unim , domine  --  ahhhhhmen , " he sang . And he could hear his wife commenting , " That 's silly and besides it might hurt somebody 's feelings . You ca n't go around hurting feelings . " A clerk in a grocery store  --  Marullo 's grocery store  --  a man with a wife and two darling children . When is he alone , when can he be alone ? Customers in the daytime , wife and kiddies in the evening ; wife at night , customers in the daytime , wife and kiddies in the evening . " Bathroom  --  that 's when , " Ethan said loudly , and right now , before I open the sluice . Oh ! the dusky , musky , smelly-welly , silly-billy time  --  the slovenly-lovely time . " Now whose feelings can I hurt , sugarfoot ? " he said to his wife . " There ai n't nobody nor nobody 's feelings here . Just me and my unimum unimorum until  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawer behind the counter by the cash register he took a clean apron and unfolded it and straightened the  | tapes , put it around his thin middle , brought the tapes around and back again . He reached behind his back with both hands and fumbled a bowknot . The apron was long , halfway down his shins . He raised his right hand , cupped loosely , palm upward , and he declaimed , " Hear me oh ye canned pears , ye pickles and ye piccalilli ? ' As soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led Him into their council ? ' as soon as it was day . The buggers went to work early , did n't they ? They did n't waste no time nohow . Let 's see now . And it was about the sixth hour ' ? that 's maybe twelve o'clock ? and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour . And the sun was darkened . ' Now how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to die  --  a dreadful long time . " He dropped his hand and looked wondering at the crowded shelves as though they might answer him . " You do n't speak to me now , Mary , my dumpling . Are you one of the Daughters of Jerusalem ? Weep not for me , ' He said . Weep for yourselves and for your children . . . . For if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ? ' Still breaks me up . Aunt Deborah wrought better than she knew . It 's not the sixth hour yet  --  not yet . " He raised the green shades on the big windows , saying , " Come in , day ! " And then he unlocked the front doors . " Enter , world . " He swung the iron-barred doors open and latched them open . And the morning sun lay softly on the pavement as it should , for in April the sun arose right where the High Street ran into the bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep the sidewalk . A day , a livelong day , is not one thing but many . It changes not only in growing light toward zenith and decline again , but in texture and mood , in tone and meaning , warped by a thousand factors of season , of heat or cold , of still or multi winds , torqued by odors , tastes , and the fabrics  | of ice or grass , of bud or leaf or black-drawn naked limbs . And as a day changes so do its subjects , bugs and birds , cats , dogs , butterflies and people . Ethan Allen Hawley 's quiet , dim , and inward day was ' done . The man who swept the morning pavement with metronomic strokes was not the man who could sermonize to canned goods , not a unimum unimorum man , not even a silly-billy man . He gathered cigarette ends and gum wrappers , bud cases from the pollenizing trees , and simple plain dust in the sweep of his broom and moved the windrow of derelict toward the gutter , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker took his measured decent way from his house on Maple Street toward the red brick basilica of a First National Bank . And if his steps were not of equal length , who was to know that out of ancient habit he avoided breaking his mother 's hack ? " Good morning , Mr. Baker , " Ethan said and held his stroke to save the banker 's neat serge pants from dust . " Morning , Ethan . Fine morning . " " Fine , " said Ethan . " Spring 's in , Mr. Baker . Groundhog was right again . " " He was , he was . " Mr. Baker paused . " I 've been wanting to talk to you , Ethan . That money your wife got by her brother 's will  --  over five thousand , is n't it ? " " Sixty-five hundred after taxes , " Ethan said . " Well , it 's just lying in the bank . Ought to be invested . Like to talk to you about that . Your money should be working . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can only stand by for emergencies . " " I 'm not a believer in idle money , Ethan . " " Well , this also serves  --  just standing and waiting . " The banker 's voice became frosty . " I do n't understand . " His inflection said he did understand and found it stupid ,  | and his tone twisted a bitterness in Ethan , and the bitter , ness spawned a lie . The broom traced a delicate curve against the pavement . " It 's this way , sir . That money is Mary 's temporary security if anything should happen to me . " " Then you should use part of it to insure your life . " " But it 's only temporary , sir . That money was Mary 's brother 's estate . Her mother is still living . She may live many years . " " I understand . Old people can be a burden . " " They can also sit on their money . " Ethan glanced at Mr. Baker 's face as he said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the banker 's collar . " You see , sir , if I invested Mary 's money I might lose it , the way I lost my own , the way my father lost the pot . " " Water under the bridge , Ethan  --  water under the bridge . I know you got burned . But times are changing , new opportunities opening up . " " I had my opportunity , Mr. Baker , more opportunity than good sense . Do n't forget I owned this store right after the war . Had to sell half a block of real estate to stock it-the last of our business property . " " I know , Ethan . I 'm your banker . Know your business the way your doctor knows your pulse . " " Sure you know . Took me less than two years to damn near go bankrupt . Had to sell everything but my house to pay my debts . " " You ca n't take all the blame for that . Fresh out of the Army  --  no business experience . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only we called it recession . Some pretty seasoned businessmen went under . " " I went under all right . It 's the first time in history a Hawley was ever a clerk in a guinea grocery . " " Now that 's what I do n't understand , Ethan . Anybody can go broke . . What I do n't see is why you stay broke , a  | man of your family and background and education . It does n't have to be permanent unless your blood has lost its guts . What knocked you out , Ethan ? What kept you knocked out ? " Ethan started an angry retort ? Course you do n't understand ; you 've never had it  --  and then he swept a small circle of gum wrappers and cigarette butts into a pyramid and moved the pyramid toward the gutter . " Men do n't get knocked out , or I mean they can fight back against big things . What kills them is erosion ; they get nudged into failure . They get slowly scared . I 'm scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife needs clothes . My children  --  shoes and fun . And suppose they ca n't get an education ? And the monthly bills and the doctor and teeth and a tonsillectomy , and beyond that suppose I get sick and ca n't sweep this goddam sidewalk ? Course you do n't understand . It 's slow . It rots out your guts . I ca n't think beyond next month 's payment on the refrigerator . I hate my job and I 'm scared I 'll lose it . How could you understand that ? " " How about Mary 's mother ? " " I told you . She sits on it . She 'll die sitting on it . " " I did n't know . I thought Mary came from a poor family . But I know when you 're sick you need medicine or maybe an operation or maybe a shock . Our people were daring men . You know it . They did n't let themselves get nibbled to death . And now times are changing . There are opportunities our ancestors never dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foreigners are taking us over . Wake up , Ethan . " " And how about the refrigerator ? " " Let it go if you have to . " " And how about Mary and the children ? " " Forget them for a while . They 'll like you better if you climb out of the hole . You 're not helping them by worrying about them . "  | " And Mary 's money ? " " Lose it if you have to but risk it . With care and good advice you do n't have to lose it . Risk is n't loss . Our people have always been calculated-risk people and they did n't lose . I 'm going to shock you , Ethan . You 're letting down the memory of old Cap'n Hawley . You owe his memory something . Why , he and my daddy owned the Belle-Adair together , one of the last built and finest of all whaling bottoms . Get off your ass , Ethan . You owe the Belle-Adair something you have n't paid in guts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant piece of cellophane over the gutter 's edge with his broom tip . He said softly , " The BelleAdair burned to the waterline , sir . " " I know she did , but did that stop us ? It did not . " " She was insured . " " Of course she was . " " Well , I was n't . I saved my house and nothing else . " " You 'll have to forget that . You 're brooding on something past . You 've got to scrape up some courage , some daring . That 's why I said you should invest Mary 's money . I 'm trying to help you , Ethan . " " Thank you , sir . " " We 'll get that apron off you . You owe that to old Cap'n Hawley . He would n't believe it . " " I guess he would n't " " That 's the way to talk . We 'll get that apron off . " " If it was n't for Mary and the children ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . There 's some interesting things going to happen here in New Baytown . You can be part of it . " " Thank you , sir . " " Just let me think about it . " " Mr. Morphy says he 's going to work when you close at noon . I 'm making him some sandwiches . Want me to make you some ? "  | " No thanks . I 'm letting Joey do the work . He 's a good man . There 's some property I want to look up . In the County Clerk 's office , that is . Nice and private there from twelve till three . Might be something in that for you . We 'll talk soon . So long . " He took a long first step to miss a crack and crossed the alley entrance to the front door of the First National Bank , and Ethan smiled at his retreating back . He finished his sweeping quickly , for people were trickling and fresheting to work now . He set the stands of fresh fruit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one was passing , he removed three stacked cans of dog food and , reaching behind , brought out the grim little bag of currency , replaced the dog food , and , ringing " no sale " on the cash register , distributed the twenties , tens , fives , and one-dollar bills in their places under the small retaining wheels . And in the oaken cups at the front of the cash drawer he segregated the halves , quarters , dimes , nickels , and pennies , and slammed the drawer shut . Only a few customers showed up , children sent for a loaf of bread or a carton of milk or a pound of forgotten coffee , little girls with sleep-messy hair . Margie Young-Hunt came in , pert-breasted in a salmon sweater . Her tweed skirt clung lovingly in against her thighs and tucked up under her proud fanny , but it was in her eyes , her brown myopic eyes , that Ethan saw what his wife could never see because it was n't there when wives were about . This was a predator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawley called it a " roving eye . " It was in her voice too , a velvet growl that changed to a thin , mellow confidence for wives . " Morning , Eth , " Margie said . " What a day for a picnic ! " " Morning . Want to take a bet you ran out of coffee ? " " If you guess I ran out of Alka-Seltzer , I 'm going to avoid you . " " Big night ? "  | " In a small way . Traveling-salesman story . A divorced woman 's safe . Brief case of free samples . Guess you 'd call him a drummer . Maybe you know him . Name of Bigger or Bogger , travels for B. B. D. and D. Reason I mention it is he said he was coming in to see you . " " We buy from Waylands mostly . " " Well , maybe Mr. Bugger 's just drumming up business , if he feels better than I do this morning . Say , could you give me a glass of water ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethan went to the storeroom and brought back a Dixie cup of water from the tap . She dropped three of the flat tablets in and let them fizz . Then , " Mud in your eye , " she said and tossed it back . " Get to work , you devils , " she said . " I hear you 're going to read Mary 's fortune today . " " Oh , Lord ! I nearly forgot . I should go in the business . I could made my own fortune . " " Mary loves it . Are you good at it ? " " Nothing to be good at . You let people  --  women , that is ? talk about themselves and then tell it back to them and they think you 've got second sight . " " And tall dark strangers ? " " There 's that , sure . If I could read men , I would n't have pulled the bellywhoppers I have . Brother ! did I misread a couple of characters . " " Did n't your first husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to his ashes , the son of a ? No , let it ride . Peace be to his ashes . " Ethan greeted the entering elderly Mrs. Ezyzinski solicitously and lingered over the transference of a quarter of a pound of butter , even passed a complimentary word or two about the weather , but Margie Young-Hunt , relaxed and smiling , inspected the gold-sealed cans of pdte de foie Bras and the minuscule jewel-cases of caviar in back of the counter by the cash register . " Now , " said Margie when the old lady tottered out , muttering to herself in Polish .  | " Now  --  what ? " " I was just thinking  --  if I knew as much about men as I do about women , I 'd put out my shingle . Why do n't you teach me about men , Ethan ? " " You know enough . Maybe too much . " " Oh , come on ! Do n't you have a silly bone in your body ? " " Want to start now ? " " Maybe some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A group . Mary and you and the two kids . Subject : men  --  their weakness and stupidity and how to use them . " Margie ignored his tone . " Do n't you ever work late ? accounts first of the month , that stuff ? " " Sure . I take the work home . " She raised her arms over her head and her fingers moused in her hair . " Why ? " she asked . " Cat 's why to make kittens ' britches . " " See what you could teach me if you would ? " Ethan said , " And after that they had mocked Him , they took the robe off from Him and put His own raiment on Him and led Him away to crucify Him . And as they came out they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name . Him they compelled to bear His cross . And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha  --  that is to say , a place of a skull ? ' " " Oh , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is correct .... " " Do you know what a son of a bitch you are ? " " Yes , 0 Daughter of Jerusalem . " Suddenly she smiled . " Know what I 'm going to do ? I 'm going to read one hell of a fortune this morning . You 're going to be a big shot , did you know ? Everything you touch will turn to gold  --  a leader of men . " She walked quickly to the door and then turned back , grinning . " I dare you to live up to it and I dare you not to . So long , Savior ! " How strange the sound of heeltaps on pavement , striking in anger .  | At ten o'clock everything changed . The big glass doors of the bank folded open and a river of people dipped in for money and brought the money to Marullo 's and took away the fancy foods Easter calls for . Ethan was busy as a water skater until the sixth hour struck . The angry firebell from its cupola on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted away with their bags of baked meats . Ethan brought in the fruit stands and closed the front doors , and then for no reason except that a darkness fell on the world and on him , he pulled down the thick green shades and the darkness fell on the store . Only the neon in the cold counter glared a ghostly blue . Behind the counter he cut four fat slices of rye bread and buttered them liberally . He slid open the cold doors and picked out two slices of processed Swiss cheese and three slices of ham . " Lettuce and cheese , " he said , " lettuce and cheese . When a man marries he lives in the trees . " He mortared the top slices of bread with mayonnaise from a jar , pressed the lids down on the sandwiches , and trimmed the bits of lettuce and ham fat from the edges . Now a carton of milk and a square of waxed paper for wrapping . He was folding the ends of the paper neatly when a key rattled in the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sack-chested so that his arms seemed short and stood out from his body . His hat was on the back of his head so that his stiff iron-gray bangs showed like a cap . Marullo 's eyes were wet and sly and sleepy , but the gold caps on his front teeth shone in the light from the cold counter . Two top buttons of his pants were open , showing his heavy gray underwear . He hooked little fat thumbs in the roll of his pants under his stomach and blinked in the half-darkness . " Morning , Mr. Marullo . I guess it 's afternoon . " " Hi , kid . You shut up good and quick . " " Whole town 's shut . I thought you 'd be at mass . " " No mass today . Only day in the year with no mass. "  | " That so ? I did n't know that . Anything I can do for you ? " The short fat arms stretched and rocked back and forth on the elbows . " My arms hurt , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing you can do ? " " I do everything  --  hot pads , shark oil , pills  --  still hurts . All nice and shut up . Maybe we can have a talk , eh , kid ? " His teeth flashed . " Anything wrong ? " " Wrong ? What 's wrong ? " " Well , if you 'll wait a minute , I 'll just take these sandwiches to the bank . Mr. Morphy asked for them . " " You 're a smart kid . You give service . That 's good . " Ethan went through the storeroom , crossed the alley , and knocked on the back door of the bank . He passed the milk and sandwiches in to Joey . " Thanks . You did n't need to . " " It 's service . Marullo told me . " " Keep a couple of Cokes cold , will you ? I got dry zeros in my mouth . " When Ethan returned , he found Marullo peering into a garbage-can . " Where do you want to talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He picked cauliflower leaves from the can . " You cutting off too much . " " Just to make them neat . " " Cauliflower is by weight . You throwing money in the garbage . I know a smart Greek fella owns maybe twenty restaurants . He says the big secret is watch the garbage cans . What you throw out , you do n't sell . He 's a smart fella . " " Yes , Mr. Marullo . " Ethan moved restlessly toward the front of the store with Marullo behind him bending his elbows back and forth . " You sprinkling good the vegetables like I said ? "  | " Sure . " The boss lifted a head of lettuce . " Feels dry . " " Well , hell , Marullo , I do n't want to waterlog them ? they 're one-third water now . " " Makes them look crisp , nice and fresh . You think I do n't know ? I start with one pushcart  --  just one . I know . You got to learn the tricks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you paying too much . " " Well , we advertise Grade A beef . " " A , B , C  --  who knows ? It 's on the card , ai n't it ? Now , we going to have a nice talk . We got dead wood on our bills . Anybody do n't pay by the fifteenth  --  off the books . " " We ca n't do that . Some of these people have been trading here for twenty years . " " Listen , kid . Chain stores wo n't let John D. Rockefeller charge a nickel . " " Yes , but these people are good for it , most of them . " " What 's good for it ' ? It ties up money . Chain stores buy carloads . We ca n't do that . You got to learn , kid . Sure ? nice people ! Money is nice too . You got too much meat scraps in the box . " " That was fat and crust . " " Okay if you weigh before you trim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look after number one , whose 'll do it ? You got to learn , kid . " The gold teeth did not glitter now , for the lips were tight little traps . Anger splashed up in Ethan before he knew it and he was surprised . " I 'm not a chiseler , Marullo . " " Who 's a chiseler ? That 's good business , and good business is the only kind of business that stays in business . You think Mr. Baker is giving away free samples , kid ? " Ethan 's top blew off with a bang . " You listen to me , " he shouted . " Hawleys have been living here since the middle seventeen hundreds . You 're a foreigner . You would n't know about that . We 've been getting along with our neighbors  | and being decent all that time . If you think you can barge in from Sicily and change that , you 're wrong . If you want my job , you can have it  --  right here , right now . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nose ? " All Marullo 's teeth gleamed now . " Okay , okay . Do n't get mad . I just try to do you a good turn . " " Do n't call me kid . My family 's been here two hundred years . " In his own ears it sounded childish , and his rage petered out . " I do n't talk very good English . You think Marullo is guinea name , wop name , dago name . My genitori , my name , is maybe two , three thousand years old . Marullus is from Rome , Valerius Maximus tells about it . ' What 's two hundred years ? " " You do n't come from here . " " Two hundred years ago you do n't neither . " Now Ethan , his rage all leaked away , saw something that makes a man doubtful of the constancy of the realities outside himself . He saw the immigrant , guinea , fruit-peddler change under his eyes , saw the dome of forehead , the strong beak nose , deep-set fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles , saw pride so deep and sure that it could play at humility . It was the shocking discovery that makes a man wonder : If I 've missed this , what else have I failed to see ? " You do n't have to talk dago talk , " he said softly . " Good business . I teach you business . Sixty-eight years I got . Wife she 's died . Arthritis ! I hurt . I try to show you business . Maybe you do n't learn . Most people they do n't learn . Go broke . " " You do n't have to rub it in because I went broke . " " No . You got wrong . I 'm try to learn you good business so you do n't go broke no more . " " Fat chance . I have n't got a business . " " You 're still a kid . "  | Ethan said , " You look here , Marullo . I practically run this store for you . I keep the books , bank the money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't that good business ? " " Sure  --  you learned something . You 're not no kid no more . You get mad when I call you kid . What I 'm going to call you ? I call everybody kid . " " Try using my name . " " Do n't sound friendly . Kid is friendly . " " It 's not dignified . " " Dignified is not friendly . " Ethan laughed . " If you 're a clerk in a guinea store , you 've got to have dignity  --  for your wife , for your kids . You under-stand ? " " Is a fake . " " Course it is . If I had any real dignity , I would n't think about it . I nearly forgot something my old father told me not long before he died . He said the threshold of insult is in direct relation to intelligence and security . He said the words son of a bitch ' are only an insult to a man who is n't quite sure of his mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was alive then . So you go right on calling me kid if you want to . " " You see , kid ? More friendly . " " All right then . What were you going to tell me about business that I 'm not doing ? " " Business is money . Money is not friendly . Kid , maybe you too friendly  --  too nice . Money is not nice . Money got no friends but more money . " " That 's nonsense , Marullo . I know plenty of nice , friendly , honorable businessmen . " " When not doing business , kid , yes . You going to find out . When you find out is too late . You keep store nice , kid , but if it 's your store you maybe go friendly broke . I 'm teaching true lesson like school . Goo-by , kid . " Marullo flexed his  | arms and went quickly out the front door and snapped it after him , and Ethan felt darkness on the world . A sharp metallic rapping came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , " We 're closed till three . " " Let me in . I want to talk to you . " The stranger came in  --  a spare man , a perpetually young man who had never been young , a smart dresser , hair gleaming thinly against his scalp , eyes merry and restless . " Sorry to bother you . Got to blow town . Wanted to see you alone . Thought the old man 'd never go . " " Marullo ? " " Yeah . I was across the street . " Ethan glanced at the immaculate hands . On the third finger of the left hand he saw a big cat 's eye set in a gold ring . The stranger saw the glance . " Not a stick-up , " he said . " I met a friend of yours last night . " " Yes ? " " Mrs. Young-Hunt . Margie Young-Hunt . " " Oh ? " Ethan could feel the restless sniffing of the stranger 's mind , searching for an opening , for a bond on which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a big build-up . That 's why I thought ? My name 's Biggers . I cover this territory for B. B. D. and D. " " We buy from Waylands . " " I know you do . That 's why I 'm here . Thought you might like to spread it out a little . We 're new in this district . Building up fast . Have to make some concessions to get a foot in the door . It would pay you to take advantage of that . " " You 'd have to see Mr. Marullo about that . He 's always had a deal with Waylands. "  | The voice did n't lower but its tone became confidential . " You do the ordering ? " " Well , yes . You see Marullo has arthritis , and besides he has other interests . " " We could shave prices a little . " " I guess Marullo 's got them shaved as close as they 'll shave . You 'd better see him . " " That 's what I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's you . " " I 'm just a clerk . " " You do the ordering , Mr. Hawley . I can cut you in for five per cent . " " Marullo might go for a discount like that if the quality was the same . " " You do n't get it . I do n't want Marullo . This five per cent would be in cash  --  no checks , no records , no trouble with the tax boys , just nice clean green cabbage from my hand to your hand and from your hand to your pocket . " " Why ca n't Marullo get the discount ? " " Price agreements . " " All right . Suppose I took the five per cent and turned it over to Marullo ? " " I guess you do n't know them like I do . You turn it over to him , he 'll wonder how much more you are n't turning over . That 's perfectly natural . " Ethan lowered his voice . " You want me to double-cross the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He do n't lose anything and you make a buck . Everybody 's got a right to make a buck . Margie said you were a smart cooky . " " It 's a dark day , " Ethan said . " No , it 's not . You got the shades pulled down . " The sniffing mind smelled danger  --  a mouse confused between the odor of trap wire and the aroma of cheese . " Tell you what , " Biggers said , " you think about it . See if you can  | throw some business our way . I 'll drop in to see you when I 'm in the district . I make it every two weeks . Here 's my card . " Ethan 's hand remained at his side . Biggers laid the card on top of the cold counter . " And here 's a little memento we got out for new friends . " From his side pocket he brought a billfold , a rich and beautiful affair of pin seal . He placed it beside the card on the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's license , lodge cards . " Ethan did not reply . " I 'll drop by in a couple of weeks , " Biggers said . " You think about it . I 'll sure be here . Got a date with Margie . There 's quite a kid . " With no reply , he said , " I 'll let myself out . See you soon . " Then suddenly he came close to Ethan . " Do n't be a fool . Everybody does it , " he said . " Everybody ! " And he went rapidly out the door and closed it quietly after him . In the darkened silence Ethan could hear the low hum of the transformer for the neon light in the cold counter . He turned slowly to the piled and tiered audience on the shelves . " I thought you were my friends ! You did n't raise a hand for me . Fair-weather oysters , fair-weather pickles , fairweather cake-mix . No more unimus for you . Wonder what Saint Francis would say if a dog bit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Thank you , Mr. Dog , grazie tanto , Signora Bird ' ? " He turned his head toward a rattling and a knocking and a pounding on the alley door , went quickly through the storeroom , muttering , " More customers than if we were open . " Joey Morphy staggered in , clutching his throat . " For God 's sake , " he groaned . " Succor  --  or at least Pepsi-Cola , for I dieth of dryth . Why is it so dark in here ? Are mine eyes failething too ? " " Shades pulled down . Trying to discourage thirsty bankers . "  | He led the way to the cold counter and dug out a frosted bottle , uncapped it , and reached for another . " Guess I 'll have one too . " Joey-boy leaned against the lighted glass and poured down half the bottle before he lowered it . " Hey ! " he said . " Somebody 's lost Fort Knox . " He picked up the billfold . " That 's a little gift from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hustle some of our business . " " Well , he ai n't hustling peanuts . This here 's quality , son . Got your initials on it , too , in gold . " " It has ? " " You mean you do n't know ? " " He just left a minute ago . " Joey flipped open the folded leather and rustled the clear plastic identification envelopes . " You better start joining something , " he said . He opened the back . " Now here 's what I call real thoughtful . " Between first and second fingers he extracted a new twenty-dollar bill . " I knew they were moving in but did n't know with tanks . That 's a remembrance worth remembering . " " Was that in there ? " " You think I planted it ? " " Joey , I want to talk to you . The guy offered me five per cent of any business I threw their way . " " Well , bully-bully ! Prosperity at last . And it was n't no idle promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your day . " " You do n't mean I should take it ? " " Why not , if they do n't add it on the cost ? ' Who loses ? " " He said I should n't tell Marullo or he 'd think I was getting more . " " He would . What 's the matter with you , Hawley ? You nuts ? I guess it 's that light . You look green . Do I look green ? You were n't thinking of turning it down ? " " I had trouble enough not kicking him in the ass . " " Oh ! It 's like that  --  you and the dinosaurs . "  | " He said everybody does it . " " Not everybody can get it . You 're just one of the lucky ones . " " It 's not honest . " " How not ? Who gets hurt ? Is it against the law ? " " You mean you 'd take it ? " " Take it  --  I 'd sit up and beg for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practically everything you can do in a bank is against the law  --  unless you 're president . I do n't get you . What are you boggle-boggling about ? If you were taking it away from Alfio lad , I 'd say it was n't quite straight  --  but you 're not . You do them a favor , they do you a favor  --  a nice crisp green favor . Do n't be crazy . You 've got a wife and kids to think of . Raising kids ai n't going to get any cheaper . " " I wish you 'd go away now . " Joey Morphy put his unemptied bottle down hard on the counter . " Mr. Hawley  --  no , Mr. Ethan Allen Hawley , " he said coldly , " if you think I would do anything dishonest or suggest that you do  --  why you can go and screw yourself . " Joey stalked toward the storeroom . " I did n't mean that . I did n't mean it . Honest to God I did n't , Joey . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dreadful holiday  --  dreadful . " Morphy paused . " I know ? " " And every year , ever since I was a kid , only it gets worse because  --  maybe because I know more what it means , I hear those lonely lama sabach thani ' words . " " I do know , Ethan , I do . It 's nearly over  --  nearly over now , Ethan . Just forget I stomped out , will you ? " And the iron firebell clanged  --  one single stroke . " It 's over now , " said Joey-boy . " It 's all over  --  for a year . " He drifted quietly out through the storeroom and eased the alley door shut . Ethan raised the shades and opened the store again , but  | there was n't much trade  --  a few bottle-of-milk and loaf-ofbread kids , a small lamb chop and can of peas for Miss Borcher for her hot-plate supper . People were just not moving about in the street . During the half-hour before six o'clock , while Ethan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in . And he locked up and started away before he remembered the groceries for home  --  had to go back and assemble them in two big bags and lock up over again . He had wanted to walk down to the bayside and watch the gray waves among the pilings of the dock and smell the sea water and speak to a seagull standing beak into the wind on a mooring float . He remembered a lady-poem written long ago by someone whipped to frenzy by the gliding spiral of a gull 's flight . The poem began : " Oh ! happy fowl  --  what thrills thee so ? " And the lady poet had never found out , probably did n't want to know . The heavy bags of groceries for the holidays discouraged the walk . Ethan moved wearily across the High Street and took his way slowly along Elm toward the old Hawley house .  | MARY came from the stove and took one of the big grocery bags from him . " I 've got so much to tell you . Ca n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lips . " What 's the matter ? " she asked . " Little tired . " " But you were closed three hours . " " Plenty to do . " " I hope you are n't gloomy . " " It 's a gloomy day . " " It 's been a wonderful day . Wait till you hear . " e " Where are the kids ? " " Upstairs with the radio . They 've got something to tell you too . " " Trouble ? " " Now why do you say that ? " " I do n't know . " " You do n't feel well . " " Damn it , I do too . " " With all the lovely things  --  I ' 11 wait till after dinner for our part . Are you going to be surprised . " Allen and Mary Ellen boiled down the stairs and into the kitchen . " He 's home , " they said . " Pop , you got Peeks in the store ? "  | " You mean that cereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd bring some . It 's the one with a mouse mask on the box that you cut out . " " Are n't you a little old for a mouse mask ? " Ellen said , " You send the box top and ten cents and you get a ventriloquism thing and instructions . We just heard it on the radio . " Mary said , " Tell your father what you want to do . " " Well , we 're going to enter the National I Love America Contest . First prize is go to Washington , meet the President  --  with parents  --  lots of other prizes . " " Fine , " said Ethan . " What is it ? What do you have to do ? " " Hearst papers , " Ellen cried . " All over the country . You just write an essay why you love America . All the winners get to go on television . " " It 's the grapes , " said Allen . " How about going to Washington , hotel , shows , meet the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " How about your schoolwork ? " " It 's this summer . They announce the winners Fourth of July . " " Well , that might be all right . Do you really love America or do you love prizes ? " " Now , Father , " said Mary , " do n't go spoiling it for them . " " I just wanted to separate the cereal from the mouse mask . They get all mixed up . " " Pop , where would you say we could look it up ? " " Look it up ? " " Sure , like what some other guys said ? " " Your great-grandfather had some pretty fine books . They 're in the attic . " " Like what ? " " Oh , like Lincoln 's speeches and Daniel Webster and Henry Clay . You might take a look at Thoreau or Walt  | Whitman or Emerson  --  Mark Twain too . They 're all up there in the attic . " " Did you read them , Pop ? " " He was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe you could help us with the essays . " " Then they would n't be yours . " " Okay , " said Allen . " Will you remember to bring home some Peeks ? They 're full of iron and stuff . " " I 'll try . " " Can we go to the movies ? " Mary said , " I thought you were going to dye the Easter eggs . I 'm boiling them now . You can take them out on the sun porch after dinner . " " Can we go up in the attic and look at the books ? " " If you turn out the light after . Once it burned for a week . You left it on , Ethan . " When the children had gone , Mary said , " Are n't you glad they 're in the contest ? " " Sure , if they do it right . " " I ca n't wait to tell you  --  Margie read me in cards today , three times , because she said she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cards come up myself . " " Oh ! Lord !

" He said , " Mary , I want to warn you . " " Warn me ? Why , you do n't even know . My fortune is you . " He spoke a harsh , bitter word under his breath . " What did you say ? " " I said , Slim pickings . ' " " That 's what you think , but that 's not what the cards think . Three times , she threw them . " " Cards think ? "  | " They know , " said Mary .

And it 's going to stay yours . Did you think that up or did ? " " She never mentioned it . And the cards did n't . You are going to invest in July and from then on , it 's one thing after another  --  one right after another . But do n't it sound nice ? That 's the way she said it ? Your fortune is Ethan .

What I think is you 're jealous of my friends  --  that 's what I think . I had a happy afternoon and you want to spoil it . That 's not nice . " Mary 's face was mottled with angry disappointment , and vengeful toward this obstacle to her daydreaming . " You just sit there , Mr. Smart , and tear people down . You think Margie made it all up . She did n't , because I cut the cards three times  --  but even supposing she did , why would she do it except to be kind and friendly and offer a little help . You tell me that , Mr. Smart ! You find some nasty reason . "  | " I wish I knew , " he said . " It might be pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might be mischief .

Why , there are men in this town after her all the time . Big men , married men , whispering and urging  --  nasty . Sometimes she do n't know where to turn . That 's why she needs me , a woman friend . Oh , she told me things  --  men you just would n't believe . Why some of them even pretend they do n't like her in public , and then they sneak to her house or call her up and try to get her to meet them  --  sanctimonious men , always preaching morals and then doing like that . You talk about mischief . " " Did she say who they were ? " " No , she did n't and that 's another proof . Margie do n't want to hurt anybody even if they hurt her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" The way she said it was like it was somebody we know well and just could n't believe . " " But she would tell under certain circumstances , " Ethan said softly . " Only if she was forced . She said that herself . Only if she had to if like her  --  honor , or her good name , you know . . . Who do you s'pose it could be ? " " I think I know . " " You know ? Who ? " " Me .

You could climb out of it if you did n't have your old-fashioned fancy-pants ideas . Everybody 's laughing at you . A grand gentleman without money is a bum .

" She listened to his tread .  | MY WIFE , My Mary , goes to her sleep the way you would close the door of a closet . So many times I have watched her with envy . Her lovely body squirms a moment as though she fitted herself into a cocoon . She sighs once and at the end of it her eyes close and her lips , untroubled , fall into that wise and remote smile of the ancient Greek gods . She smiles all night in her sleep , her breath purrs in her throat , not a snore , a kitten 's purr . For a moment her temperature leaps up so that I can feel the glow of it beside me in the bed , then drops and she has gone away . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must , of course . That simply means her dreams do not trouble her , or trouble her so much that she forgets them before awakening . She loves to sleep and sleep welcomes her . I wish it were so with me . I fight off sleep , at the same time craving it . I have thought the difference might be that my Mary knows she will live forever , that she will step from the living into another life as easily as she slips from sleep to wakefulness . She knows this with her whole body , so completely that she does not think of it any more than she thinks to breathe . Thus she has time to sleep , time to rest , time to cease to exist for a little . On the other hand , I know in my bones and my tissue that I will one day , soon or late , stop living and so I fight  | against sleep , and beseech it , even try to trick it into coming . My moment of sleep is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have awakened at this second still feeling the crushing blow . And once in sleep , I have a very busy time . My dreams are the problems of the day stepped up to absurdity , a little like men dancing , wearing the horns and masks of animals . I sleep much less in time than Mary does . She says she needs a great deal of sleep and I agree that I need less but I am far from believing that . There is only so much energy stored in a body , augmented , of course , by foods . One can use it up quickly , the way some children gobble candy , or unwrap it slowly . There 's always a little girl who saves part of her candy and so has it when the gobblers have long since finished . I think my Mary will live much longer than I. She will have saved some of her life for later . Come to think of it , most women live longer than men . Good Friday has always troubled me . Even as a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony of the crucifixion , but feeling the blighting loneliness of the Crucified . And I have never lost the sorrow , planted by Matthew , and read to me in the clipped , tight speech of my New England Great-Aunt Deborah . Perhaps it was worse this year . We do take the story to ourselves and identify with it . Today Marullo instructed me , so that for the first time I understood it , in the nature of business . Right afterward I was offered my first bribe . That 's an odd thing to say at my age , but I do n't remember any other . I must think about Margie Young-Hunt . Is she an evil thing ? What is her purpose ? I know she has promised me something and threatened me if I do n't accept it . Can a man think out his life , or must he just tag along ? So many nights I have lain awake , hearing my Mary 's little purring beside me . If you stare into darkness , red spots start swimming on your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sleep that I have tried to protect her in it , even  | when the electric itch burned on my skin . She wakens if I leave the bed . It worries her . Because her only experience with sleeplessness has been in illness , she thinks I am not well . This night I had to get up and out . Her breath purred gently and I could see the archaic smile on her mouth . Maybe she dreamed of good fortune , of the money I was about to make . Mary wants to be proud . It is odd how a man believes he can think better in a special place . I have such a place , have always had it , but I know it is n't thinking I do there , but feeling and experiencing and remembering . It 's a safety place  --  everyone must have one , although I never heard a man tell of it . Secret , quiet movement often awakens a sleeper when a deliberate normal action does not . Also I am convinced that sleeping minds wander into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the bathroom , and when it was so , got up and went . And afterward I went quietly downstairs , carrying my clothes , and dressed in the kitchen . Mary says I share other people 's troubles that do n't exist . Maybe that is so , but I did see a little possible scene play out in the dim-lighted kitchen  --  Mary awakening and searching the house for me , and her face troubled . I wrote a note on the grocery pad , saying , " Darling  --  I 'm restless . Have gone for a walk . Be back soon . " I think I left it squarely in the center of the kitchen table so that if the light was turned on at the wall switch it would be the first thing seen . Then I eased the back door open and tasted the air . It was chilly , smelled of a crusting of white frost . I muffled up in a heavy coat and pulled a knitted sailor 's cap down over my ears . The electric kitchen clock growled . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red spots in the dark since eleven . Our town of New Baytown is a handsome town , an old town , one of the first clear and defined whole towns in America . Its first settlers and my ancestors , I believe , were  | sons of those restless , treacherous , quarrelsome , avaricious seafaring men who were a headache to Europe under Elizabeth , took the West Indies for their own under Cromwell , and came finally to roost on the northern coast , holding charters from the returned Charles Stuart . They successfully combined piracy and puritanism , which are n't so unalike when you come right down to it . Both had a strong dislike for opposition and both had a roving eye for other people 's property . Where they merged , they produced a hard-bitten , e. surviving bunch of monkeys . I know about them because my father made me know . He was a kind of high amateur ancestor man and I 've always noticed that ancestor people usually lack the qualities of the ones they celebrate . My father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Singlehanded he lost the land , money , prestige , and future ; in fact he lost nearly everything Aliens and Hawleys had accumulated over several hundred years , lost everything but the names  --  which was all my father was interested in anyway . Father used to give me what he called " heritage lessons . " That 's why I know so much about the old boys . Maybe that 's also why I 'm a clerk in a Sicilian grocery on a block Hawleys used to own . I wish I did n't resent it so much . It was n't depression or hard times that wiped us out . All that came from starting to say New Baytown is a pretty town . I turned right on Elm Street instead of left and walked fast up to Porlock , which is a cockeyed parallel with High . Wee Willie , our fat constable , would be dozing in his police car on the High , and I did n't want to pass the time of night with him . " What you doing up so late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wee Willie gets lonesome and loves to talk , and then later he talks about what he talked about . Quite a few small but nasty scandals have grown out of Willie 's loneliness . The day constable is Stonewall Jackson Smith . That 's not a nickname . He was  | christened Stonewall Jackson , and it does set him apart from all the other Smiths . I do n't know why town cops have to be opposites but they usually are . Stoney Smith is a man who would n't give away what day it is unless he were on the stand under oath . Chief Smith runs the police work of the town and he 's dedicated , studies the latest methods , and has taken the F.B.I . training in Washington . I guess he 's as good a policeman as you are likely to find , tall and quiet and with eyes like little gleams of metal . If you were going in for crime , the chief would be a man to avoid . All this came from my going over to Porlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Porlock that the beautiful houses of New Baytown are . You see in the early eighteen hundreds we had over a hundred whaling bottoms . When the ships came back from a year or two out as far as the Antarctic or the China Sea , they would be loaded with oil and very rich . But they would have touched at foreign ports and picked up things as well as ideas . That 's why you see so many Chinese things in the houses on Porlock Street . Some of those old captain-owners had good taste too . With all their money , they brought in English architects to build their houses . That 's why you see so much Adam influence and Greek revival architecture on Porlock Street . It was that period in England . But with all the fanlights and fluted columns and Greek keys , they never neglected to put a widow 's walk on the roof . The idea was that the faithful home-bound wives could go up there to watch for returning ships , and maybe some of them did . My family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Bakers were older . They stayed put on Elm Street and their houses were what is called Early American , peak roofs and shiplap siding . That 's the way my house , the old Hawley house , is . And the giant elms are as old as the houses . Porlock Street has kept its gas street lamps , only there are electric globes in them now . In the summer tourists  | come to see the architecture and what they call " the oldworld charm " of our town . Why does charm have to be old-world ? I forget how the Vermont Aliens got mixed up with the Hawleys . It happened pretty soon after the Revolution . I could find out , of course . Up in the attic somewhere there will be a record . By the time father died , my Mary was pretty tired of Hawley family history , so when she suggested that we store all the things in the attic , I understood how she felt . You can get pretty tired of other people 's family r history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a family of Irish extraction but not Catholic . She always makes a point of that . Ulster family , she calls them . She came from Boston . No she did n't , either . I got her in Boston . I can see both of us , maybe more clearly now than then , a nervous , frightened Second Lieutenant Hawley with a weekend pass , and the soft , petal-cheeked , sweet-smelling darling of a girl , and triply all of those because of war and textbooks . Flow serious we were , how deadly serious . I was going to be killed and she was prepared to devote her life to my heroic memory . It was one of a million identical dreams of a million olive uniforms and cotton prints . And it might well have ended with the traditional Dear John letter except that she devoted her life to her warrior . Her letters , sweet with steadfastness , followed me everywhere , round , clear handwriting in dark blue ink on light blue paper , so that my whole company recognized her letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had n't wanted to marry Mary , her constancy would have forced me to for the perpetuation of the world dream of fair and faithful women . She has not wavered , not in the transplanting from Boston Irish tenancy to the old Hawley house on Elm Street . And she never wavered in the slow despondency of my failing business , in the birth of our children , or in the paralysis of my long clerkship . She is a waiter  --  I can see that now .  | And I guess she had at lengthy last grown weary of waiting . Never before had the iron of her wishes showed through , for my Mary is no mocker and contempt is not her tool . She has been too busy making the best of too many situations . It only seemed remarkable that the poison came to a head because it had not before . How quickly the pictures formed against the sound of frost-crunching footsteps on the night street . There 's no reason to feel furtive walking in the early morning in New Baytown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing me walking toward the bay at three in the morning would suppose I was going fishing and not give it another thought . Our people have all sorts of fishing theories , some of them secret like family recipes , and such things are respected and respectable . The street lights made the hard white frost on the lawns and sidewalks glint like millions of tiny diamonds . Such a frost takes a footprint and there were none ahead . I have always from the time I was a child felt a curious excitement walking in new unmarked snow or frost . It is like being first in a new world , a deep , satisfying sense of discovery of something clean and new , unused , undirtied . The usual nightfolk , the cats , do n't like to walk on frost . I remember once , on a dare , I stepped out barefoot on a frosty path and it felt like a burn to my feet . But now in galoshes and thick socks I put the first scars on the glittering newness . Where Porlock crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just off Hicks Street , the clean frost was scarred with long foot-dragged tracks . Danny Taylor , a restless , unsteady ghost , wanting to be somewhere else and dragging there and wanting to be somewhere else . Danny , the town drunk . Every town has one , I guess . Danny Taylor  --  so many town heads shook slowly from side to side  --  good family , old family , last of the line , good education . Did n't he have some trouble at the Academy ? Why does n't he straighten up ? He 's killing himself with booze and that 's  | wrong because Danny 's a gentleman . It 's a shame , begging money for booze . It 's a comfort that his parents are n't alive to see it . It would kill them  --  but they 're dead already . But that 's New Baytown talking . In me Danny is a raw sorrow and out of that a guilt . I should be able to help him . I 've tried , but he wo n't let me . Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , same age and growing up , same weight and strength . Maybe my guilt comes because I am my brother 's keeper and I have not saved him . With a feeling that deep down , excuses  --  even valid ones  --  give no relief . Taylors  --  as old a family as Hawleys or Bakers or any of the others . In childhood I can remtmber no picnic , no circus , no competition , no Christmas without Danny beside me as close as my own right arm . Maybe if we had gone to college together this would n't have happened . I went to Harvard  --  luxuriated in languages , bathed in the humanities , lodged in the old , the beautiful , the obscure , indulged myself with knowledge utterly useless in running a grocery store , as it developed . And always 1 wished Danny could be with me on that bright and excited pilgrimage . But Danny was bred for the sea . His appointment to the Naval Academy was planned and verified and certain even when we were kids . His father sewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three years with honors and then expelled . It killed his parents , they say , and it killed most of Danny . All that remained was this shuffling sorrow  --  this wandering night sorrow cadging dimes for a pint of skull-buster . I think the English would say , " He 's let the side down , " and that always wounds the let-downer more than the side . Danny 's a night wanderer now , an early-morning man , a lonely , dragging thing . When he asks for a quarter for skull-buster his eyes beg you to forgive him because he ca n't forgive himself . He sleeps in a shack in back of the boat works where Wilburs used to be shipbuilders . I stooped over his track to see whether he was headed home or away . By the scuff of the  | frost he was going out and I might meet him any place . Wee Willie would n't lock him up . What would be the good ? There was no question where I was going . I had seen and felt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Harbor is pretty far gone now . After the new breakwater went in and the municipal pier , sand and silt crept in and shallowed that once great anchorage sheltered by the jagged teeth of Whitsun Reef . And where once were shipways and ropewalks and warehouses and whole families of coopers to make the whale-oil casks , and docks too over which the bowsprits of whalers could project to their chain stays and figureor fiddleheads . Three-masters they were usually , squarerigged ; the after mast carried square sails as well as boomand-gaff spanker  --  deep-hulled ships built to suffer the years at sea in any weather . The flying jib boom was a separate spar and the double dolphin-striker served as spritsail gaffs as well . I have a steel engraving of the Old Harbor chockablock with ships , and some faded photographs on tin , but I do n't really need them . I know the harbor and I know the ships . Grandfather rebuilt it for me with his stick made from a narwhal 's horn and he drilled me in the nomenclature , rapping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pile of what was once the Hawley dock , a fierce old man with a white whisker fringe . I loved him so much I ached from it . " All right , " he 'd say , in a voice that needed no megaphone from the bridge , " sing out the full rig , and sing it loud . I hate whispering . " And I would sing out , and he 'd whack the pile with his narwhal stick at every beat . " Flying jib , " I 'd sing ( whack ) , " outer jib " ( whack ) , " inner jib , jib " ( whack ! whack ! ) . " Sing out ! You 're whispering . " " Fore skys'l , fore royal , fore topgal' n't s'l , fore upper tops'l , fore lower tops'l , fores'l " ? and every one a whack.  | " Main ! Sing out . " " Main skys'l " ? whack . But sometimes , as he got older , he would tire . " Belay the main , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out now . " " Aye , sir . Mizzen skys'l , mizzen royal , mizzen t'gal' n't , mizzen upper tops'l , mizzen lower tops'l , crossjack ? " " And ? " " Spanker . " " How rigged ? " " Boom and gaff , sir . " Whack  --  whack  --  whack  --  narwhal stick against the waterlogged pile . As his hearing got fuzzier , he accused more and more 4'people of whispering . " If a thing 's true , or even if it ai n't true and you mean it , sing out , " he would cry . Old Cap'n 's ears may have gone wonky toward the end of his life , but not his memory . He could recite you the tonnage and career of every ship , it seemed like , that ever sailed out of the Bay , and what she brought back and how it was divided , and the odd thing was that the great whaling days were nearly over before he was master . Kerosene he called " skunk oil , " and kerosene lamps were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't care much or maybe was content just to remember . His death did n't shock me . The old man had drilled me in his death as he had in ships . I knew what to do , inside myself and out . On the edge of the silted and sanded up Old Harbor , right where the Hawley dock had been , the stone foundation is still there . It comes right down to the low-tide level , and high water laps against its square masonry . Ten feet from the end there is a little passage about four feet wide and four feet high and five feet deep . Its top is vaulted . Maybe it was a drain one time , but the landward entrance is cemented in with sand and broken rock . That is my Place , the place everybody needs . Inside it you are out of sight except from seaward . There 's nothing at Old Harbor now  | but a few clammers ' shacks , rattlety things , mostly deserted in the winter , but clammers are a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end and they walk with their heads down and their shoulders bowed . That was the place I was headed for . I spent nighttide there before I went in the service , and the nighttide before I married my Mary , and part of the night Ellen was born that hurt her so bad . I was compelled to go and sit inside there and hear the little waves slap the stone and look out at the sawtooth Whitsun rocks . I saw it , lying in bed , watching the ( lance of the red spots , and I knew I had to sit there . It 's big changes take me there  --  big changes . South Devon runs along the shore , and there are lights aimed at the beach put there by good people to keep lovers from getting in trouble . They have to go somewhere else . A town ordinance says that Wee Willie has to patrol once an hour . There was n't a soul on the beach  --  not a soul , and that was odd because someone is going fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I lowered myself over the edge and found the outcrop stone and doubled into the little cave . And I had hardly settled myself before I heard Wee Willie 's car go by . That 's twice I had avoided passing the time of night with him . It sounds uncomfortable and silly , sitting cross-legged in a niche like a blinking Buddha , but some way the stone fits me , or I fit . Maybe I 've been going there so long that my behind has conformed to the stones . As for its being silly , I do n't mind that . Sometimes it 's great fun to be silly , like children playing statues and dying of laughter . And sometimes being silly breaks the even pace and lets you get a new start . When I am troubled , I play a game of silly so that my dear will not catch trouble from me . She has n't found me out yet , or if she has , I 'll never know it . So many things I do n't know about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me . I do n't think she knows about the Place . How would she ? I 've never told anyone . It has no  | name in my mind except the Place  --  no ritual or formula or anything . It 's a spot in which to wonder about things . No man really knows about other human beings . The best he can do is to suppose that they are like himself . Now , sitting in the Place , out of the wind , seeing under the guardian lights the tide creep in , black from the dark sky , I wondered whether all men have a Place , or need a Place , or want one and have none . Sometimes I 've seen a look in eyes , a frenzied animal look as of need for a quiet , secret place where soul-shivers can abate , where a man is one and can take stock of it . Of course I know of the theories of back to the womb and the death-wish , and these may be true of some men , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy ways of saying something that is n't easy . I call whatever happens in the Place " taking stock . " Some others might call it prayer , and maybe it would be the same thing . I do n't believe it 's thought . If I wanted to make a picture of it for myself , it would be a wet sheet turning and flapping in a lovely wind and drying and sweetening the white . What happens is right for me , whether or not it is good . There were plenty of matters to consider and they were jumping and waving their hands for attention like kids in school . Then I heard the slow puttering of a boat engine , a one-lunger , a fishing craft . Her masthead light moved south beyond the Whitsun rocks . I had to put everything aside until she turned her red and green lights safe in the channel , a local boat to have found the entrance so easily . She dropped anchor in the shallows and two men came ashore in her skiff . Little wavelets brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the mooring floats . Item : There was Mary , my dear , to think of , asleep with the smile of mystery on her lips . I hoped she would n't awaken and look for me . But if she did , would she ever tell me ? I doubt it . I think that Mary , for all that she seems to tell everything , tells very little . There was the fortune to  | consider . Did Mary want a fortune or did she want it for me ? The fact that it was a fake fortune , rigged by Margie Young-Hunt for reasons I did n't know , made no difference at all . A fake fortune was just as good as any and it is possible that all fortunes are a little fake . Any man of reasonable intelligence can make money if that 's what he wants . Mostly it 's women or clothes or admiration he really wants and they deflect him . The great artists of finance like Morgan and Rockefeller were n't deflected . They wanted and got money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another matter . I 've always felt they got scared of the ghost they raised and tried to buy it off . Item : By money , Mary meant new curtains and sure education for the kids and holding her head a little higher and , face it , being proud rather than a little ashamed of me . She had said it in anger and it was true . Item : Did I want money ? Well , no . Something in me hated being a grocery clerk . In the Army I made captain , but I know what got me into O. T. C. It was family and connections . I was n't picked for my pretty eyes , but I did make a good officer , a good officer . But if I had really liked command , imposing my will on others and seeing them jump , I might have stayed in the Army and I 'd have been a colonel by now . But I did n't . I wanted to get it over . They say a good soldier fights a battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Marullo was telling me the truth about business , business being the process of getting money . And Joey Morphy was telling it straight , and Mr. Baker and the drummer . They all told it straight . Why did it revolt me and leave a taste like a spoiled egg ? Am I so good , or so kind , or so just ? I do n't think so . Am I so proud ? Well , there 's some of that . Am I lazy , too lazy to be involved ? There 's an awful lot of inactive kindness which is nothing but laziness , not wanting any trouble , confusion , or effort . There is a smell and a feel of dawn long before the light .  | It was in the air now , a tempering of the wind ; a new star or a planet cleared the horizon to eastward . I should know what star or planet but I do n't . The wind freshens or steadies in the false dawn . It really does . And I would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have much of a go before daylight . What is the saying ? " The stars incline , they do not command " ? Well , I 've heard that a good many serious financiers go to astrologers for instruction in stock purchase . Do the stars incline toward a bull market ? Is A. T. and T. influenced by the stars ? Nothing as sweet and remote in my fortune as a star . A beat-up tarot deck of fortune-telling cards in the hands of an idle , mischievous woman , and she had rigged the cards . Do the cards incline but not command ? Well , the cards inclined me out to the Place in the middle of the night , and they inclined me to give more thought than I wanted to , to a subject I dee tested . That 's quite a bit of inclining right there . Could they incline me to a business cleverness I never had , to acquisitiveness foreign to me ? Could I incline to want what I did n't want ? There are the eaters and the eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are the eaters more immoral than the eaten ? In the end all are eaten  --  all  --  gobbled up by the earth , even the fiercest and the most crafty . The roosters up on Clam Hill had been crowing for a long time and I had heard and not heard . I wished I could stay to see the sun rise straight out from the Place . I said there was no ritual involved with the Place but that is not entirely true . Sometime on each visit I reconstruct Old Harbor for my mind 's pleasure  --  the docks , the warehouses , the forests of masts and underbrush of rigging and canvas . And my ancestors , my blood  --  the young ones on the deck , the fully grown aloft , the mature on the bridge . No nonsense of Madison Avenue then or trimming too many leaves from cauliflowers . Some dignity was then for a man , some stature . A man could breathe . That was my father talking , the fool . Old Cap'n re- membered the fights over shares , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lawsuits , yes , and the killings  --  over women , glory , adventure ? Not at all . Over money . It was a rare partnership , he said , that lasted more than one voyage , and blistering feuds ever afterward , continuing after the cause was forgotten . There was one bitterness old Cap'n Hawley did not forget , a crime he could not forgive . He must have told me about it many times , standing or sitting on the rim of Old Harbor . We spent a goodly time there , he and I. I remember him pointing with his narwhal stick . " Take that third rock on Whitsun Reef , " he said . " Got her ? Now , line her up with the tip of Porty Point at high water . See it there ? Now  --  half a cable-length out on that line is where she lies , at least her keel . " " The Belle-Adair ? " " The Belle-Adair . " " Our ship . " " Half ours , a partnership . She burned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an accident . " " You think she was fired , sir ? " " I do . " " But  --  but you ca n't do that . " " I could n't . " " Who did ? " " I do n't know . " " Why ? " " Insurance . " " Then it 's no different now . " " No different . " " There must be some difference . " " Only in a single man alone  --  only in one man alone . There 's the only power  --  one man alone . Ca n't depend on anything else . " He never spoke to Cap'n Baker again , my father told me , but he did n't carry it to his son , Mr. Banker Baker . He  | would n't do that any more than he would burn a ship . Good God , I 've got to get home . And I got . I almost ran and I went up the High Street without thinking . It was still dark enough but a rim of lightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves gray iron . I rounded the war memorial and passed the post office . In a doorway Danny Taylor stood as I knew he must , hands in pockets , collar of his ragged coat turned up , and his old peaked shooter 's cap with the earflaps turned down . His face was blue-gray with cold and sickness . " Eth , " he said , " I 'm sorry to bother you . Sorry . I 've got to have some skull-buster . You know I would n't ask if I did n't have to . " " I know . I mean I do n't know , but I believe you . " I gave him a dollar bill . " Will that do it ? " His lips were trembling the way a child 's lips do when it 's about to cry . " Thank you , Eth , " he said . " Yes  --  that will put me away all day and maybe all night . " He began to look better just thinking of it . " Danny  --  you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were my brother , Danny . You still are . I 'll do anything in the world to help you . " A little color came into his thin cheeks . he looked at the money in his hand and it was as though he had taken his first gulp of skull-buster . Then he looked at me with hard cold eyes . " In the first place it 's nobody 's goddam business . And in the second place you have n't got a bean , Eth . You 're as blind as I am , only it 's a different kind of blindness . " " Listen to me , Danny . " " What for ? Why , I 'm better off than you are . I 've got my ace in the hole . Remember our country place ? " " Where the house burned down ? Where we used to play in the cellar hole ? " " You remember it all right . It 's mine . " " Danny , you could sell it and get a new start . "  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of it for taxes every year . The big meadow is still mine . " " Why wo n't you sell it ? " " Because it 's me . It 's Daniel Taylor . Long as I have it no Christy sons of bitches can tell me what to do and no bastards can lock me up for my own good . Do you get it ? " " Listen , Danny ? " " I wo n't listen . If you think this dollar gives you the right to preach to me  --  here ! Take it back . " " Keep it . " " I will . You do n't know what you 're talking about . You 've never been a  --  drunk . I do n't tell you how to wrap bacon do I ? Now if you 'll go your own way , I 'll knock on a window and get some skull-buster . And do n't forget  --  I 'm better off than you are . I 'm not a clerk . " He turned around and put his head in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world by looking away from it . And he stayed there until I gave up and walked on . Wee Willie , parked in front of the hotel , stirred out of his nap and rolled down the window of his Chevrolet . " Morning , Ethan , " he said . " You up early or out late ? " " Both . " " Must have found yourself a fancy piece . " " Sure did , Willie , an houri . " " Now , Eth , do n't tell me you 'd take up with no streetwalker . " " I swear it . " " Ca n't believe nothing no more . I bet you was fishing . How 's Missus ? " " Asleep . " " That 's where I 'll be , come shift . " I went on without reminding him that 's where he 'd been . I walked quietly up my back steps and switched on the kitchen light . My note was on the table a little left of center . I 'd swear I left it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat waiting for it to perk , and it  | had just begun to bounce when Mary came down . My darling looks like a little girl when she awakens . You could n't think she is the mother of two big brats . And her skin has a lovely smell , like new-cut grass , the most cozy and comforting odor I know . " What are you doing up so early ? " " Well may you ask . Please to know I have been up most of the night . Regard my galoshes there by the door . Feel them for wetness . " " Where did you go ? " " Down by the sea there is a little cave , my rumpled duck . I crawled inside and I studied the night . " " Now wait . " " And I saw a star come out of the sea , and since it had no owner I took it for our star . I tamed it and turned it back to fatten . " " You 're being silly . I think you just got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe me , ask Wee Willie . I spoke to him . Ask Danny Taylor . I gave him a dollar . " " You should n't . He 'll just get drunk . " " I know . That was his wish . Where can our star sleep , sweet fern ? " " Does n't coffee smell good ? I 'm glad you 're silly again . It 's awful when you 're gloomy . I 'm sorry about that fortune thing . I do n't want you to think I 'm not happy . " " Do n't give it a worry , it 's in the cards . " " What ? " " No joke . I 'm going to make our fortune . " " I never know what you 're thinking . " " That 's the greatest difficulty with telling the truth . Can I beat the children a little to celebrate the day before Resurrection ? I promise to break no bones . " " I have n't washed my face , " she said . " I could n't imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she had gone up to the bathroom , I put my note to her in my pocket . And I still did n't know . Does anyone ever know even the outer fringe of another ? What are you like in there ? Mary  --  do you hear ? Who are you in there ?  | THAT Saturday morning seemed to have a pattern . I wonder whether all days have . It was a withdrawn day . The little gray whisper of my Aunt Deborah came to me , " Of course , Jesus is dead . This is the only day in the world 's days when He is dead . And all men and women are dead too . Jesus is in Hell . But tomorrow . Just wait until tomorrow . Then you 'll see something . " I do n't remember her very clearly , the way you do n't remember someone too close to look at . But she read the Scripture to me like a daily newspaper and I suppose that 's fi the way she thought of it , as something going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter , Jesus really rose from the dead , an explosion , expected but nonetheless new . It was n't two thousand years ago to her ; it was now . And she planted something of that in me . I ca n't remember wanting to open the store before . I think I hated every sluggish sloven of a morning . But this day I wanted to go . I love my Mary with all my heart , in some ways much better than myself , but it is also true that I do not always listen to her with complete attention . When she tells the chronicle of clothes and health and conversations which please and enlighten her , I do not listen at all , so that sometimes she exclaims , " But you should have known . I told you . I remember very clearly telling you on  | Thursday morning . " And there 's no doubt at all about that . She did tell me . She tells me everything in certain areas . This morning I not only did n't listen , I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk myself and I did n't have anything to say  --  because , to give her fair due , she does n't listen to me either , and a good thing sometimes . She listens to tones and intonations and from them gathers her facts about health and how my mood is and am I tired or gay . And that 's as good a way as any . Now that I think of it , she does n't listen to me because I am not talking to her , but to some dark listener within myself . And she does n't really talk to me either . Of course when the children or some other hell-raising crises are concerned , all that changes . I 've thought so often how telling changes with the nature of the listener . Much of my talk is addressed to people who are dead , like my little Plymouth Rock Aunt Deborah or old Cap'n . I find myself arguing with them . I remember once in weary , dusty combat I called out to old Cap'n , " Do I have to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . And do n't whisper . " He did n't argue  --  never did . Just said I must , and so I did . Nothing mysterious or mystic about that . It 's asking for advice or an excuse from the inner part of you that is formed and certain . For pure telling , which is another way of saying asking , my mute and articulate canned and bottled goods in the grocery serve very well . So does any passing animal or bird . They do n't argue and they do n't repeat . Mary said , " You 're not going already ? Why you have half an hour . That 's what comes of getting up so early . " " Whole flock of crates to open , " I said . " Things to put on the shelves before I open . Great decisions . Should pickles and tomatoes go on the same shelf ? Do canned apricots quarrel with peaches ? You know how important color relations are on a dress . " " You 'd make a joke about anything , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's better than grumping . So many men grump. "  | And I was early . Red Baker was n't out yet . You can set your watch by that dog , or any dog . He 'd start his stately tour in exactly half an hour . And Joey Morphy would n't , did n't show . The bank would n't be open for business but that did n't mean Joey would n't be there working on the books . The town was very quiet but of course a lot of people had gone away for the Easter weekend . That and the Fourth of July and Labor Day are the biggest holidays . People go away even when they do n't want to . I believe even the sparrows on Elm Street were away . I did see Stonewall Jackson Smith on duty . He was just coming from a cup of coffee in the Foremaster Coffee Shop . He was so lean and brittle that his pistols and handcuffs seemed outsize . He wears his officer 's cap at an angle , jaunty , and picks his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoney . Long hard day making money . " " Huh ? " he said . " Nobody 's in town . " What he meant was that he wished he were n't . " Any murders , Stoney , or other grisly delights ? " " It 's pretty quiet , " he said . " Some kids wrecked a car at e the bridge . But , hell , it was their own car . Judge 'll make ' em pay for repairing the bridge . You heard about the bank job at Floodhampton ? " " No . " " Not even on television ? " " We do n't have one , yet . Did they get much ? " " Thirteen thousand , they say . Yesterday just before closing . Three fellas . Four-state alarm . Willie 's out on the highway now , bitching his head off . " " He gets plenty of sleep . " " I know , but I do n't . I was out all night . " " Think they 'll catch them ? " " Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Insurance companies keep nagging . Never let up . " " It would be nice work if they did n't catch you . " " Sure would , " he said .  | " Stoney , I wish you 'd look in on Danny Taylor . He looks awful sick . " " Just a question of time , " Stoney said . " But I 'll go by . It 's a shame . Nice fella . Nice family . " " It kills me . I like him . " " Well you ca n't do nothing with him . It 's going to rain , Eth . ' Willie hates to get wet . " For the first time in my memory , I went into the alley with pleasure and opened the back door with excitement . The cat was by the door , waiting . I ca n't remember a morning when that lean and efficient cat has n't been waiting to try to get in the back door and I have never failed to throw a stick at him or run him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got in . I call the cat " he " because his ears are torn up from fighting . Are cats strange animals or do they so resemble us that we find them curious as we do monkeys ? Perhaps six or eight hundred times that cat has tried to get in and he has never made it . " You 're due for a cruel surprise , " I told the cat . He was sitting in a circle of his tail , and the tip flicked up between his front feet . I went into the dark store , took a can of milk from the shelf , punched it open , and squirted it into a cup . Then I carried the cup to the storeroom and set it just inside and left the door open . He watched me gravely , looked at the milk , and then walked away and slid over the fence in back of the bank . I was watching him go when Joey Morphy came into the alley with the key to the bank 's back door ready in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been to bed . " Hi , Mr. Hawley . " " I thought you were closed today . " " Looks like I never close . Thirty-six-dollar mistake in the books . I worked till midnight last night . " " Short ? " " No  --  over . " " That should be good . "  | " Well , it ai n't . I got to find it . " " Are banks that honest ? " " Banks are . It 's only some men that are n't . If I 'm going to get any holiday , I 've got to find it . " " Wish I knew something about business . " " I can tell you all I know in one sentence . Money gets money . " " That does n't do me much good . " " Me either . But I can sure give advice . " " Like what ? " " Like never take the first offer , and like , if somebody wants to sell , he 's got a reason , and like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That the quick course ? " " That 's it , but it do n't mean nothing without the first . " " Money gets money ? " " That cuts a lot of us out . " " Do n't some people borrow ? " " Yeah , but you have to have credit and that 's a kind of money . " " Guess I better stick to groceries . " " Looks like . Hear about the Floodhampton bank ? " " Stoney told me . Funny , we were just talking about it yesterday , remember ? " i1 I " I 've got a friend there . Three guys  --  one talked with an accent , one with a limp . Three guys . Sure they 'll get them . Maybe a week . Maybe two . " " Tough ! " " Oh , I do n't know . They are n't smart . There 's a law against not being smart . " " I 'm sorry about yesterday . " " Forget it . I talk too much . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never learn that . Say , you look good . " " I should n't . Did n't get much sleep . " " Somebody sick ? " " No . Just one of those nights . "  | " Do n't I know . . .. " I swept out the store and raised the shades and did n't know I was doing it or hating it . Joey 's rules popped around and around in my head . And I discussed matters with my friends on the shelves , perhaps aloud , perhaps not . I do n't know . " Dear associates , " I said , " if it 's that simple , why do n't more people do it ? Why does nearly everyone make the same mistakes and over and over ? Is there always something forgotten ? Maybe the real basic weakness might be some form of kindness . Marullo said money has no heart . Would n't it be true then that any kindness in a money man would be a weakness ? How do you get nice ordinary Joes to slaughter people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy looks different or talks different . But then how about civil war ? Well the Yankees ate babies and the Rebs starved prisoners . That helps . I 'll get around to you , sliced beets and tinned button mushrooms , in a moment . I know you want me to talk about you . Everyone does . But I 'm on the verge of it ? point of reference , that 's it . If the laws of thinking are the laws of things , then morals are relative too , and manner and sin  --  that 's relative too in a relative universe . Has to be . No getting away from it . Point of reference . " You dry cereal with the Mickey Mouse mask on the box and a ventriloquism gadget for the label and ten cents . I 'll have to take you home , but right now you sit up and listen . What I told dear Mary as a joke is true . My ancestors , those highly revered ship-owners and captains , surely had commissions to raid commerce in the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to the British they were pirates , and what they took they kept . That 's how the family fortune started that was lost by my father . That 's where the money that makes money came from . We can be proud of it . " I brought in a carton of tomato paste , slashed it open , and stacked the charming slender little cans on their de- pleted shelf . " Maybe you do n't know , because you 're kind of foreigners . Money not only has no heart but no honor nor any memory . Money is respectable automatically if you keep it a while . You must not think I am denouncing money . I admire it very much . Gentlemen , may I introduce some newcomers to our community . Let 's see , I 'll put them here beside you catsups . Make these bread-and-butter pickles welcome in their new home . New Yorkers , born and sliced and bottled . I was discussing money with my friends here . One of your finest families  --  oh , you 'd know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , they got their big start selling beef to the British when our country was at war with the British , and their money is as admired as any and so is the family . And another dynasty , probably the greatest bankers of them all . The founder bought three hundred rifles from the Army . The Army had rejected them as dangerously defective and so he got them very cheap , maybe fifty cents apiece . Pretty soon General Fremont was ' ' ready to start his heroic trek to the ' West , and he bought the rifles , sight unseen , for twenty dollars apiece . No one ever heard whether they blew up in the troopers ' hands . And that was the money that makes money . It does n't matter how you get it just as long as you get it and use it to make more . I 'm not being cynical . Our lord and master , Marullo of the ancient Roman name , is quite right . Where money is concerned , the ordinary rules of conduct take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps because you are discreet . You do not repeat my words , or gossip . Money is a crass and ungracious subject only when you have it . The poor find it fascinating . But do n't you agree that if one becomes actively interested in money , he should know something of its nature and character and tendencies ? I 'm afraid that very few men , and they great artists or misers , are interested in money for itself . And you can kick out those misers who are conditioned by fear . " By now there was a large pile of empty cartons on the  | floor . I carried them to the storeroom to be trimmed and kept . Lots of people carry supplies home in them and , as Marullo would say , " It saves bags , kid . " There 's that " kid " again . I do n't mind it any more . I want him to call me " kid , " even to think of me as " kid . " While I was stacking the cartons , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my big old silver railroad watch , and do you know for the first time in my life I had not opened on the moment of nine . Here it was plainly quarter after nine . All that discussion with the groceries had thrown me . Through the glass-and-iron screen of the door I could see it was Margie Young-Hunt . I had never really looked at her , had never inspected her . Maybe that 's why she did the fortune  --  just to make sure I knew she existed . I should n't change too quickly . I threw open the doors . " Did n't mean to rout you out . " " But I 'm late . " " Are you ? " " Sure . It 's after nine . " She sauntered in . Her behind stuck out nice and round and bounced slowly , one up and one down with each step . She was well enough stacked in front so she did n't have to emphasize them . They were there . Margie is what Joey-boy would call a " dish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps I was seeing her for the first time . Her features regular , nose a little long , lips outlined fuller than they were , the lower particularly . Her hair dyed a rich chestnut brown that does n't occur in nature , but pretty . Her chin was fragile and deep-cut but there was plenty of muscle in the cheeks and very wide cheekbones . Margie 's eyes had had care . They were that hazel to blue to steel color that changes with the light . It was a durable face that had taken it and could take it , even violence , even punching . Her eyes flicked about , to me , to the groceries , and back to me . I imagined she was a very close observer and a good rememberer too .  | " I hope you do n't have the same problem as yesterday . " She laughed . " No  --  no . I do n't get a drummer every day . This time I really ran out of coffee . " " Most people do . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people every morning ran out of coffee . " " Is that true ? " " Sure . Say , I want to thank you for sending your drummer in . " " It was his idea . " " But you did it . What kind of coffee ? " " Does n't matter . I make lousy coffee no matter what kind I get . " " Do you measure ? " " Sure , and it 's still lousy . Coffee just is n't  --  I nearly said my cup of tea . ' " " You did say it . Try this blend . " I picked a can from the shelf and as she reached to take it from me  --  just that little gesture  --  every part of her body moved , shifted , announced itself quietly . I 'm here , the leg . Me , the thigh . Not better than me , the soft belly . Everything was new , newly seen . I caught my breath . Mary says a woman can put out signals or not , just as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communications system that ran from her pointed patentleather toe to her curving soft chestnut hair . " You seem to have got over your mullygrabs . " " I had ' em bad yesterday . Do n't know where they come from . " " Do n't I know ! Sometimes with me not for the usual reason . " " You did quite a job with that fortune . " " Sore about it ? " " No . I 'd just like to know how you did it . " " You do n't believe in that stuff . " " It 's not belief . You hit some things right on the nose .  | Things I 'd been thinking and things I 've been doing . " " Like what ? " " Like it 's time for a change . " " You think I rigged the cards , do n't you ? " " Does n't matter . If you did  --  what made you ? Have you thought of that ? " She looked me full in the eyes , suspicious , probing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean no , I never thought of that . If I rigged them , what made me ? That would be like unrigging the rig . " Mr. Baker looked in the door . " Morning , Margie , " he said . " Ethan , have you given any thought to my sugges-tion ? " " I sure have . And I 'd like to talk to you . " " Any time at all , Ethan . " " Well , I ca n't get out during the week . You know , Marullo 's hardly ever here . Going to be home tomorrow ? " " After church , sure . That 's an idea . You bring Mary about four . While the ladies jaw about Easter hats , we 'll slip off and ? " " I 've got a hundred things I want to ask . Guess I better write them down . " " Anything I know , you 're welcome to . See you then . Morning , Margie . " When he went out , Margie said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Say  --  know what would be interesting ? How about if you turned the cards blindfolded or something and see how close they come to yesterday . " " No ! " she said . " That would n't work . You kidding me , or do you really go for it ? " " Way I look at it , it does n't matter about believing . I do n't believe in extrasensory perception , or lightning or the hydrogen bomb , or even violets or schools of fish  --  but I know they exist . I do n't believe in ghosts but I 've seen them . " " Now you 're kidding . "  | " I 'm not . " " You do n't seem like the same man . " " I 'm not . Maybe nobody is , for long . " " What caused it , Eth ? " " I do n't know . Maybe I 'm sick of being a grocery clerk . " " It 's about time . " " Do you really like Mary ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You just do n't seem to be the same kind of  --  well , you 're so different from her . " " I see what you mean . But I do like her . I love her . " " So do I. " " Lucky . " " I know I am . " " I meant her . Well , I 'll go make my lousy coffee . I 'll think about that card deal . " " Sooner the better , before it cools . " She tapped out , her neat buttocks jumping like live rubber . I had never seen her before . I wonder how many people I 've looked at all my life and never seen . It 's scary to think about . Point of reference again . When two people meet , each one is changed by the other so you 've got two new people . Maybe that means  --  hell , it 's complicated . I agreed with myself to think about such things at night when I could n't sleep . Forgetting to open on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene of the murder , or your glasses like those what-you-callems in Chicago . What does that mean ? ' What crime ? What murder ? At noon I made four sandwiches , cheese and ham , with lettuce and mayonnaise . Ham and cheese , ham and cheese ? when a man marries , he lives in the trees . I took two of the sandwiches and a bottle of Coke to the back door of the bank and handed them in to Joey-boy . " Find the mistake ? " " Not yet . You know , I 'm so close to it , I 'm blind . " " Why not lay off till Monday ? " " Ca n't . Banks are a screwy lot . "  | " Sometimes if you do n't think about something , it comes to you . " " I know . Thanks for the sandwiches . " He looked inside to make sure there was lettuce and mayonnaise . Saturday afternoon before Easter in the grocery business is what my august and illiterate son would call " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me at least that some deep-down underwater change was going on in me . I mean that yesterday , or any yesterday before that , I would n't have done what I did . It 's like looking at wallpaper samples . I guess I had unrolled a new pattern . The first thing was Marullo coming in . His arthritis was hurting him pretty bad . He kept flexing his arms like a weight-lifter . " How it goes ? " " Slow , Alfio . " I had never called him by his first name before . " Nobody in town ? " " I like it better when you call me kid . ' " " I thought you do n't like it . " " I find I do , Alfio . " " Everybody gone away . " His shoulders must have been burning as though there were hot sand in the joints . " How long ago did you come from Sicily ? " " Forty-seven years . Long time . " " Ever been back ? " " No . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What for ? Everything changed . " " Do n't you get curious about it ? " " Not much . " " Any relatives alive ? " " Sure , my brother and his kids and they got kids . " " I 'd think you 'd want to see them . " He looked at me , I guess , as I 'd looked at Margie , saw me for the first time .  | " What you got on your mind , kid ? " " Hurts me to see your arthritis . I thought how its warm in Sicily . Might knock the pain out . " He looked at me suspiciously . " What 's with you ? " " How do you mean ? " " You look different . " " Oh ! I got a little bit of good news . " " Not going to quit ? " " Not right away . If you wanted to make a trip to Italy , I could promise I 'd be here . " " What 's good news ? " " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " I balanced my palm back and forth . " Money ? " " Could be . Look , you 're rich enough . Why do n't you go back to Sicily and show ' em what a rich American looks like ? Soak up some sun . I can take care of the store . You know that . " " You ai n't quitting ? " " Hell , no . You know me well enough to know I would n't run out on you . " " You changed , kid . Why ? " " I told you . Go bounce the bambinos . " " I do n't belong there , " he said , but I knew I 'd planted something  --  really something . And I knew he 'd come in late that night and go over the books . He 's a suspicious bastard . He 'd hardly left when  --  well , it was like yesterday  --  the B. B. D. and D. drummer came in . " Not on business , " he said . " I 'm staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " " I 'm glad you did , " I said . " I want to give you this . " I held out the billfold with the twenty sticking out . " Hell , that 's good will . I told you I 'm not on business . " " Take it ! "  | " What you getting at ? " " It constitutes a contract where I come from . " " What 's the matter , you sore ? " " Certainly not . " " Then why ? " " Take it ! The bids are n't all in . " " Jesus  --  did Waylands make a better offer ? " " No . " " Who , then  --  them damn discount houses ? " I pushed the twenty-dollar bill into his breast pocket behind his peaked handkerchief . " I 'll keep the billfold , " I said . " It 's nice . " " Look I ca n't make an offer without I talk to the head office . Do n't close till maybe Tuesday . I 'll telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll know who it is . " " It 's your money in the pay phone . " " Well , hold it open , will you ? " " It 's open , " I said . " Doing any fishing ? " " Only for dames . I tried to take that dish Margie out there . She would n't go . Damn near snapped my head off . I do n't get dames . " " They 're curiouser and curiouser . " " You can say that again , " he said , and I have n't heard that expression in fifteen years . He looked worried . " Do n't do anything till you hear from me , " he said . " Jesus , I thought I was conning a country boy . " " I will not sell my master short . " " Nuts . You just raised the ante . " " I just refused a bribe if you feel the urge to talk about it . I guess that proves I was different . The guy began to look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bugger thought I was like him , only better at it . Just before I was ready to close up Mary telephoned . " Ethan , " she said , " now do n't get mad ? "  | " At what , flower feet ? " " Well , she 's so lonely and I thought  --  well , I asked Margie to dinner . " " Why not ? " " You 're not mad ? " " Hell , no . " " Do n't swear . Tomorrow 's Easter . " " That reminds me , press your prettiest . We 're going to Baker 's at four o'clock . " " At their house ? " " Yes , for tea . " " I 'll have to wear my Easter church outfit . " " Good stuff , fern tip . " " You 're not mad about Margie ? " " I love you , " I said . And I do . I really do . And I remember thinking what a hell of a man a man could become . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the walk of buried ballast stones , I stopped and looked at the old place . It felt different . It felt mine . Not Mary 's , not Father 's , not old Cap'n 's , but mine . I could sell it or burn it or keep it . I 'd taken only two of the back steps when the screen door whapped open and Allen boiled out yelling , " Where 's the Peeks ? Did n't you bring me the Peeks ? " " No , " I said . And , wonder layered with wonders , he did n't scream his pain and loss . He did n't appeal to his mother to agree that I had promised . He said , " Oh ! " and went quietly away . " Good evening , " I said to his retreating back and he stopped and said , " Good evening , " as though it were a foreign word he 'd just learned . Mary came into the kitchen . " You 've had a haircut , " she said . She identifies any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , pin curl , I have not . " " Well , I 've been going like spit to get the house ready . " " Ready ? " " I told you , Margie 's coming for dinner . " " I know , but why all the festive hurly-burly ? " " We have n't had a dinner guest in ages . " " That 's true . That 's really true . "  | " Are you going to put on your dark suit ? " " No , Old Dobbin , my decent gray . " " Why not the dark ? " " Do n't want to spoil the press for church tomorrow . " " I can press it tomorrow morning . " " I 'll wear Old Dobbin , as sweet a suit as you 'll find in the county . " " Children , " she called , " do n't you touch anything ! I 've put out the nut dishes . You do n't want to wear the dark ? " " No . " " Margie will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobbin . " " How do you know ? " " She told me . " " She did not . " " Wrote a letter to the paper about it . " " Be serious . You are going to be nice to her ? " " I 'm going to make love to her . " " I 'd think you 'd like to wear the dark  --  with her coming . " " Look , flower girl , when I came in , I did n't give a damn what I wore or nothing . In two short moments you have made it impossible for me to wear anything but Old Dobbin . " " Just to be mean ? " " Sure . " " Oh ! " she said in the same tone Allen had used . " What 's for dinner ? I want to wear a tie to match the meat . " " Roast chicken . Ca n't you smell it ? " " Guess I can . Mary  --  I ? " But I did n't go on . Why do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been to the Chicken Bargain Day at the Safe Rite Store . Cheaper than Marullo 's . Of course I got them wholesale and I have explained to Mary the come-on bargains at the chain stores . The bargain draws you in and you pick up a dozen other  | things that are n't bargains just because they 're under your ! land . Everyone knows it and everyone does it . My lecture to Mary Manyflowers died afoaling . The New Ethan Allen Hawley goes along with the national follies and uses them when he can . Mary said , " I hope you do n't think I was disloyal . " " My darling , what can be virtuous or sinful about a chicken ? " " It was awful cheap . " " I think you did the wise  --  the wifely thing . " " You 're making fun . " Allen was in my bedroom waiting for me . " Can I look at your Knight Templar sword ? " " Sure . It 's in the corner of the closet . " He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clothes , he got it out of the leather case and unsheathed it and held the shiny plated blade up in the light and looked at his noble posture in the mirror . " How 's the essay going ? " " Huh ? " " Do n't you mean , I beg your pardon , sir ' ? " " Yes , sir . " " I said , how 's the essay ? " " Oh ! Fine . " " You going to do it ? " " Sure . " " Sure ? " " Sure , sir . " " You can look at the hat , too . In that big leather case on the shelf . Feather 's kind of yellowy . " I got in the big old wide-bottomed tub with the lion 's feet . They made them big enough to luxuriate in in those days . I scrubbed Marullo and the whole day off my skin with a brush and I shaved in the tub without looking , feeling for the whiskers with my fingertips . Everyone would  | agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair , I looked in the mirror . I had n't seen my face in a long time . It 's quite possible to shave every day and never really to see your face , particularly if you do n't care much for it . Beauty is only skin deep , and also beauty must come from inside . It better be the second if I was to get anywhere . It is n't that I have an ugly face . To me , it just is n't interesting . I made a few expressions and gave it up . They were n't noble or menacing or proud or funny . It was just the same damn face making faces . When I came back to the bedroom , Allen had the plumed Knight Templar hat on , and if it makes me look that silly I must resign . The leather hatbox was open on the floor . It has a support made of velvet-covered cardboard like an upside-down porridge bowl . " I wonder if they can bleach that ostrich plume or do I have to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , can I have this ? " " Why not ? Where 's Ellen ? I have n't heard her young screechy voice . " " She 's writing on her I Love America essay . " " And you ? " " I 'm thinking about it . Will you bring some Peeks home ? " " I 'll probably forget it . Why do n't you drop in at the store and pick it up someday ? " " Okay . Mind if I ask something  --  sir ? " " I 'd be flattered . " " Did we use to own all High Street for two blocks ? " " We did . " " And did we have whaling ships ? " Yep . " Well , why do n't we now ? " " We lost them . " " How come ? "  | " Just up and lost them . " " That 's a joke . " " It 's a pretty darned serious joke , if you dissect it . " " We 're dissecting a frog at school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frog . Which of these beauty-ties shall I wear ? " " The blue one , " he said without interest . " Say , when you get dressed can you  --  have you got time to come up in the attic ? " " I 'll make time if it 's important . " " Will you come ? " " I will . " " All right . I 'll go up now and turn on the light . " " Be with you in a couple of tie-tying moments . " His footsteps sounded hollowly on the uncarpeted attic stairs . If I think about it while I tie a bow , the tie has a rotating tendency , but if I let my fingers take their own way , they do it perfectly . I commissioned my fingers and thought about the attic of the old Hawley house , my house , my attic . It is not a dark and spidery prison for the broken and the abandoned . It has windows with small panes so old that the light comes through lavender and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books stored there are not waiting to be thrown out or given to the Seamen 's Institute . They sit comfortably on their shelves waiting to be rediscovered . And the chairs , some unfashionable for a time , some rump-sprung , are large and soft . It is not a dusty place either . Housecleaning is attic-cleaning also , and since it is mostly closed away , dust does not enter . I remember as a child scrambling among the brilliants of books or , battered with agonies , or in the spectral half-life that requires loneliness , retiring to the attic , to lie curled in a great bodymolded chair in the violet-lavender light from the window . There I could study the big adze-squared beams that sup- port the roof  --  see how they are mortised one into another and pinned in place with oaken dowels . When it rains from rustling drip to roar on the roof , it is a fine secure place . Then the books , tinted with light , the picture books of children grown , seeded , and gone ; Chatterboxes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire , Flood , Tidal Waves , Earthquakes  --  all fully illustrated ; the Gustave Dore Hell , with Dante 's squared cantos like bricks between ; and the heartbreaking stories of I Tans Christian Andersen , the bloodchilling violence and cruelty of the Grimm Brothers , the Morte d'Arthur of majesty with drawings by Aubrey Beardsley , a sickly , warped creature , a strange choice to illustrate great , manly Malory . I remember thinking how wise a man was H. C. Andersen . The king told his secrets down a well , and his secrets were were safe . A man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading , for a story has as many versions as it has readers . Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure . Some pick out parts and reject the rest , some strain the story through their mesh of prejudice , some paint it with their own delight . A story must have some points of contact with the reader to make him feel at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tale I may tell to Allen must be differently built from the same tale told to my Mary , and that in turn shaped to fit Marullo if Marullo is to join it . But perhaps the Well of Hosay Andersen is best . It only receives , and the echo it gives back is quiet and soon over . I guess we 're all , or most of us , the wards of that nineteenth-century science which denied existence to anything it could not measure or explain . The things we could n't explain went right on but surely not with our blessing . We did not see what we could n't explain , and meanwhile a great part of the world was abandoned to children , insane people , fools , and mystics , who were more interested in what is than in why it is . So many old and lovely things are stored in the  | world 's attic , because we do n't want them around us and we do n't dare throw them out . A single unshaded light hung from a roof beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches wide and two inches thick , ample support for the neat stacks of trunks and boxes , of paper-wrapped lamps and vases and all manner of exiled finery . And the light glowed softly on the generations of books in open bookcases  --  all clean and dustless . My Mary is a stern and uncompromising dust harrier and she is neat as a top sergeant . The books are arranged by size and color . Allen rested his forehead on the top of a bookcase and glared down at the books . His right hand was on the pommel of the Knight Templar sword , point downward like a cane . " You make a symbolic picture , my son . Call it Youth , War , and Learning . ' " " I want to ask you  --  you said there was books to look up stuff . " " What kind of stuff ? " " Patriotic jazz , for the essay . " " I see . Patriotic jazz . How 's this for beat ? Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Almighty God ! I know not what course others may take , but as for me , give me liberty or give me death ! ' " " Great ! That 's the berries . " " Sure is . There were giants on the earth in those days . " " I wisht I lived then . Pirate ships . Oh boy ! Bang-bang ! Strike your colors ! Pots of gold and ladies in silk dresses and jewels . I sure wisht I lived then . Some of our folks done ? did it . You said so yourself . " " Kind of genteel piracy  --  they called them privateers . I guess it was n't as sweet as it sounds from a distance . Salt beef and biscuit . There was scurvy on the earth in those days too . "  | " I would n't mind that . I 'd get the gold and bring it home . I guess they wo n't let you do it any more . " " No  --  it 's bigger and better organized now . They call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our school that won two television prizes  --  fifty dollars and two hundred dollars . How 's that ? " " He must be smart . " " Him ? Course not . It 's a trick , he says . You got to learn the trick and then you get a gimmick . " " Gimmick ? " " Sure  --  like you 're a cripple or you support your old mother raising frogs . That gives you audience interest so they choose you . He 's got a magazine with every contest in the whole country in it . Can I get one of those magazines , Pop ? " " Well , piracy is out , but I guess the impulse lingers . " " How do you mean ? " " Something for nothing . Wealth without effort . " " Can I get that magazine ? " " I thought such things were in disrepute since the payola scandals . " " Hell , no . I mean no , sir . They just changed it around a little . I 'd sure like to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is loot , is n't it ? " " It 's all dough , no matter how you get it . " " I do n't believe that . It does n't hurt the money to get it that way but it hurts the one who gets it . " " I do n't see how . It 's not against the law . Why , some of the biggest people in this country ? " " Charles , my son , my son . " " How do you mean , Charles ? " " Do you have to be rich , Allen ? Do you have to ? " " Do you think I like to live without no motorbike ? Must be twenty kids with motorbikes . And how you think it is if your family has n't even got a car , leave alone no television ? " " I 'm deeply shocked . "  | " You do n't know how it is , Dad . One day in class I did a theme how my great-granddad was a whaling captain . " " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they call me ? Whaley . How 'd you like that ? " " Pretty bad . " " It would n't be so bad if you were a lawyer or in a bank or like that . Know what I 'm going to do with the first chunk of loot I win ? " " No , what ? " " I 'm going to buy you an automobile so you wo n't feel so lousy when other people all got one . " I said , " Thank you , Allen . " My throat was dry . " Oh , that 's all right . I ca n't get a license yet anyway . " " You 'll find all the great speeches of our nation in that case , Allen . I hope you 'll read some of them . " " I will . I need to . " " You surely do . Good hunting . " I went quietly down the stairs and moistened my lips as I went . And Allen was right . I felt lousy . When I sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the paper to me . " What a comfort you are , wiggles . " " That suit looks real nice . " " You 're a good loser and a good cook . " " The tie matches your eyes . " " You 're up to something . I can tell . I 'll trade you a secret for a secret . " " But I do n't have one , " she said . " Make one up ! " " I ca n't . Come on , Ethan , tell me . " " Any eary children listening in ? " " No . " " Well , Margie Young-Hunt came in today . Out of coffee , so she said . I think she 's carrying a torch for me . " " Come on , tell . " " Well , we were talking about the fortune and I said it would be interesting to do it again and see if it was the same . " " You did n't ! " " I did so . And she said it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . " " I do when they 're good . " " Think she 'll do it tonight ? "  | " If you care to offer me a penny for my thoughts , I think that 's why she 's coming . " " Oh , no ! I asked her . " " After she set you up for it . " " You do n't like her . " " On the contrary  --  I 'm beginning to like her very much , and to respect her . " " I wish I could tell when you 're joking . " ; ili Ellen came in then quietly so that you could n't tell whether she had been listening but I suspect she had . Ellen is a girl-girl-girl and thirteen to boot , sweet and sad , gay and delicate , sickly when she needs it . She is in that stage like dough beginning to set . She may be pretty , or not . She is a leaner , leans on me , breathes on me too , but her breath is sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Ellen leaned on the arm of my chair and her thin little shoulder touched mine . She ran one pink finger down my coat sleeve and onto the hairs on my wrist and it tickled . The blond hairs on her arm shone like gold dust under the lamp . A devious one , she is , but then I guess all girl-girl-girls are . " Nail polish , " I said . " Mama lets me if it 's only pink . Your nails are rough . " " Are n't they ? " " But they 're clean . " " I scrubbed them . " " I hate dirty nails like Allen 's . " " Maybe you just hate Allen lock , stock , and bobtail. "  | " I do . " " Good for you . Why do n't you kill him ? " " You 're silly . " She crawled her fingers behind my ear . She 's probably making some boy kids very nervous already . " I hear you are working on your essay . " " Stinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes ! Very good . I 'll let you read it when it 's done . " " Honored . I see you 're dressed for the occasion . " " This old thing ? I 'm saving my new dress for tomorrow . " " Good idea . There 'll be boys . " " I hate boys . I do hate boys . " " I know you do . Hostility is your motto . I do n't like ' em much myself . Now lean off me a minute . I want to read the paper . " She flounced like a 1920 movie star and instantly took her revenge . " When are you going to be rich ? " Yes , she 'll give some man a bad time . My instinct was to grab her and paddle her but that 's exactly what she wanted . I do believe she had eye shadow on . There was as little pity in her eyes as you 'll find in a panther 's eyes . " Next Friday , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sick of being poor . " And she slipped quickly out . A listener at doors too . I do love her , and that 's odd because she is everything I destest in anyone else  --  and I adore her . No newspaper for me . I had n't even unfolded it when Margie Young-Hunt arrived . She was done up  --  hairdresser done up . I guess Mary would know how it 's done , but I do n't . In the morning the out-of-coffee Margie was set for me like a bear trap . The same evening she drew a bead on Mary . If her behind bounced , I could n't see it . If anything was under her neat suit , it was hiding . She was a perfect guest ? for another woman  --  helpful , charming , complimentary , thoughtful , modest . She treated me as though I had taken  | on forty years since the morning . What a wonderful thing a woman is . I can admire what they do even if I do n't understand why . While Margie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you done with your hair ? " . . . " I like it " ... " That 's your color . You should always wear it " ? the harmless recognition signals of women  --  I thought of the most feminine story I ever heard . Two women meet . One cries , " What have you done with your hair ? It looks like a wig . " " It is a wig . " " Well , you 'd never know it . " Maybe these are deeper responses than we know or have any right to know . Dinner was a series of exclamations about the excellence of the roast chicken and denials that it was edible . Ellen studied our guest with a recording eye , every detail of hairdress and make-up . And I knew then how young they start the minute examination on which they base what is called their intuition . Ellen avoided my eyes . She knew she had shot to kill and she expected revenge . Very well , my savage daughter . I shall revenge myself in the cruelest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was a good dinner , over-rich and too much of it , as company dinners must be , and a mountain of dishes not ordinarily used . And coffee afterward , which we do not ordinarily have . " Does n't it keep you awake ? " " Nothing keeps me awake . " " Not even me ? " " Ethan ! " And then the silent , deadly war of the dishes . " Let me help . " " Not at all . You 're the guest . " " Well , let me carry them . " Mary 's eyes sought out the children and her spirit moved on them with fixed bayonet . They knew what was coming , but they were helpless .  | Mary said , " The children always do it . They love to . And Ilic'v do it so well . I 'm proud of them . " " Well , is n't that nice ? You do n't see it much any more . " " I know . ' We feel very fortunate that they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking for an escape , thinking of making a fuss , getting sick , dropping the beautiful old dishes . Mary must have read their evil little minds also . She said , " The remarkable thing is that they never break anything , do n't even chip a glass . " " Well , you are blessed ! " Margie said . " How did you teach them ? " " I did n't . It 's just natural with them . You know , some people are just naturally clumsy ; well , Allen and Ellen are just naturally clever with their hands . " I glanced at the kids to see how they were handling it . They knew they were being taken . I think they wondered whether Margie Young-Hunt knew it . They were still looking for an escape . I dropped the beam full on them . " Of course they like to hear compliments , " I said , " but we 're holding them up . They 'll miss the movie if we do n't let them get to it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a quick and startled look of admiration . They had n't even asked to go to the movie . Even if teen-age children are n't making a sound , it 's quieter when they 're gone . They put a boiling in the air around them . As they left , the whole house seemed to sigh and settle . No wonder poltergeists infest only houses with adolescent children . The three of us circled warily around the subject each one knew was coming . I went to the glass-fronted cabinet and took out three long-stemmed , lily-shaped glasses , cotton twist , brought home from England , heaven knows how long ago . And I poured from a basket-covered gallon jug , dark and discolored with age . " Jamaica rum , " I said . " Hawleys were seamen . "  | " Must be very old , " said Margie Young-Hunt . " Older than you or me or my father . " " It 'll take the top of your head off , " Mary said . " Well , this must be a party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think it 's all right , dear ? Just before Easter , I mean ? " " The Sacrament is n't Coca-Cola , my darling . " " Mary , I 've never seen your husband so gay . " " It 's the fortune you read , " said Mary . " It 's changed him overnight . " What a frightening thing is the human , a mass of gauges and dials and registers , and we can read only a few and those perhaps not accurately . A flare of searing red pain formed in my bowels and moved upward until it speared and tore at the place just under my ribs . A great wind roared in my ears and drove me like a helpless ship , dismasted before it could shorten sail . I tasted bitter salt and I saw a pulsing , heaving room . Every warning signal screamed danger , screamed havoc , screamed shock . It caught me as I passed behind my ladies ' chairs and doubled me over in quaking agony , and just as suddenly it was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even know it had happened . I understand how people once believed the devil could take possession . I 'm not sure I do n't believe it . Possession ! The seething birth of something foreign with every nerve resisting and losing the fight and settling back beaten to make peace with the invader . Violation  --  that 's the word , if you can think of the sound of a word edged with blue flame like a blowtorch . My dear 's voice came through . " It does n't really harm to hear nice things , " she said . I tried my voice and it was strong and good . " A little hope , even hopeless hope , never hurt anybody , " I said , and I put the jug away in its cabinet , and went back to my chair and drank half the glass of ancient , fragrant rum and sat down and crossed my knees and locked my fingers in my lap .  | " I do n't understand him , " Mary said . " He 's always hated fortune-telling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My nerve ends were rustling like dry , windblown winter grass and my laced fingers had whitened from pressure . " I 'll try to explain it to Mrs. Young  --  to Margie , " I said . " Mary comes from a noble but poor Irish family . " " We were n't all that poor . " " Ca n't you hear it in her speech ? " " Well , now that you mention it ? " " Well , Mary 's sainted , or should be , grandmother was a good Christian , was n't she , Mary ? " It seemed to me a little hostility was growing in my dear . I went on . " But she had no trouble believing in fairy people , although in strict , unbending Christian theology the two do n't mix . " " But that 's different . " " Of course it is , darling . Nearly everything 's different . Can you disbelieve in something you do n't know about ? " " Look out for him , " Mary said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will not . I do n't know about fortunes or fortune-telling . How can I not believe in it ? I believe it exists because it happens . " " But you do n't believe it 's true . " " What 's true is that people get it done , millions of them , and pay for it . That 's enough to know to be interested , is n't it ? " " But you do n't ? " " Wait ! It is n't that I do n't believe but that I do n't know . They 're not the same thing . I do n't know which comes first ? the fortune or the fortune-telling . " " I think I know what he means . " " You do ? " Mary was not pleased . " Suppose the fortune-teller was sensitive to things that are going to happen anyway . Is that what you mean ? " ow- " That 's different . But how can cards know ? " I said , " The cards ca n't even move without someone turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew she sensed Mary 's growing unease and she wanted instructions . " Could n't we work out a test ? " I asked " Well , that 's a funny thing . These things seem to resent a test and go away , but there 's no harm trying . Can you think of a test ? " " You have n't touched your rum . " They lifted their glasses together and sipped and put them down . I finished mine and got out the bottle . " Ethan , do you think you should ? " " Yes , dearling . " I filled my glass . " Why ca n't you turn the cards blindfolded ? " " They have to be read . " " How would it be if Mary turned them or I did , and you read them ? " " There 's supposed to be a closeness between the reader and the cards , but I do n't know  --  we could try . " Mary said , " I think if we do it at all , we ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . She does n't like change ? little change , I mean . The big ones she can handle better than anyone , blows up at a cut finger but would be calm and efficient with a cut throat . I had a throb of unease because I had told Mary we discussed this , and here we were seeming to think of it for the first time . " We talked about it this morning . " " Yes , when I came in for coffee . I 've been thinking about it all day . I brought the cards . " It is Mary 's tendency to confuse intentness with anger and anger with violence and she is terrified of violence . Some drinking uncles put that fear on her , and it 's a shame . I could feel her fear rising . " Let 's not fool with it , " I said . " Let 's play some cassino instead . "  | Margie saw the tactic , knew it , had probably used it . " All right with me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich . Let it go at that . " " You see , I told you he did n't believe in it . Ile leads you all around the bush and then he wo n't play . IIc makes me so mad sometimes . " " I do ? You never show it . You are always my darling wife . " Is n't it strange how sometimes you can feel currents and cross-currents  --  not always , but sometimes . Mary does n't use her mind for organized thought and maybe this makes her more receptive of impressions . A tension was growing in the room . It crossed my mind that she might not be best friends with Margie any more  --  might never feel easy with her . " I 'd really like to know about the cards , " I said . " I 'm ignorant . I always heard that gypsies do it . Are you a gypsy ? I do n't think I ever knew one . " Mary said , " Her maiden name was Russian but she 's from Alaska . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a guilty secret I 've never told you , Mary , how we came to be in Alaska . " " The Russians owned it , " I said . " We bought it from them . " " Yes , but did you know it was a prison , like Siberia , only for worse crimes ? " " What kind of crimes ? " " The worst . My great-grandmother was sentenced to Alaska for witchcraft . " " What did she do ? " " She raised storms . " I laughed . " I see you come by it naturally . " " Raising storms ? " " Reading cards  --  same thing , maybe . " Mary said , " You 're joking . That is n't true . " " It may be joking , Mary , but it 's true . That was the worst  | crime , worse than murder . I 've still got her papers  --  only of course they 're in Russian . " " Can you speak Russian ? " " Only a little now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst crime . " " See what I mean ? " said Mary . " He jumps this side and that side . You never know what he 's thinking . Last night he ? he got up before daylight this morning . ' Went for a walk . " " I 'm a scoundrel , " I said . " An unmitigated , unredeemable rascal . " " Well , I would like to see Margie turn the cards  --  but her own way without you mixing in . If we keep talking , the children will be home and then we ca n't . " " Excuse me a moment , " I said . I climbed the stairs to our bedroom . The sword was on the bed and the hatbox open on the floor . I went to the bathroom and flushed the toilet . You can hear the water rushing all over the house . I wet a cloth in cold water and pressed it against my forehead and particularly against my eyes . They seemed to bulge from inside side pressure . The cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my face down against the damp washcloth and when it warmed up I wet it again . Going through the bed- room , picked the plumed Knight Templar 's hat from its I put the hat on the newel post of the banister , and it looked like a drunken admiral if there is such a thing . " Get the card table , Eth . It takes lots of room . " box and marched down the stairs wearing it . " Oh , you fool , " said Mary . And she looked glad and relieved . The ache went out of the air . " Can they bleach ostrich feathers ? " I asked . " It 's turned yellow . " " I think so . Ask Mr. Schultz . " " I 'll take it down Monday . " " I wish Margie would turn the cards , " said Mary . " I would dearly love that . "  | I brought it from the hall closet and snapped the legs open . " Margie likes a straight chair . " I set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Concentrate , " said Margie . " On what ? " " As near as possible on nothing . The cards are in my purse over on the couch . " I 'd always thought of fortune-telling cards as greasy and thick and bent , but these were clean and shining , as though they were coated with plastic . They were longer and narrower than playing cards and many more than fifty-two . Margie sat straight at the table and fanned them  --  brightcolored pictures and intricate suits . The names were in French : l'empereur , l'ermite , le chariot , la justice , le mat , le diable  --  earth , sun , moon , and stars , and suits of swords , cups , batons , and money , I guess , if deniero means money , but the symbol was shaped like a heraldic rose , and each suit with its roi , reine , and chevalier . Then I saw strange cards  --  disturbing cards  --  a tower riven by lightning , a wheel of fortune , a man hanging by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death  --  la mort , a skeleton with a scythe . " Kind of gloomy , " I said . " Do the pictures mean what they seem to ? " " It 's how they fall in relation . If they fall upside down they reverse their meaning . " " Is there a variation in meaning ? " " Yes . That 's the interpretation . " The moment she had the cards Margie became formal . Under the lights her hands showed what I had seen before , that she was older than she looked . " Where did you learn it ? " I asked . " I used to watch my grandmother and later I took it up as a trick for parties  --  I suppose a way of getting attention . " " Do you believe in it ? "  | " I do n't know . Sometimes remarkable things come out . I do n't know . " " Could the cards be a concentration ritual  --  psychic ex-ercise ? " " Sometimes I think that 's true . When I find I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's when it is usually accurate . " Her hands were like living things as they shuffled and cut and shuffled and cut again and passed them to me to cut . " Who am I doing ? " " Read Ethan , " Mary cried . " See if it matches yesterday 's . " Margie looked at me . " Light hair , " she said , " blue eyes . Are you under forty ? " " Just . " I ? " The king of batons . " She found it in the deck . " This is you " ? a picture of a crowned and robed king holding a huge red and blue scepter and Roi de Briton printed under him . She laid it out face up and reshuffled the deck . Then she turned the cards rapidly , speaking in a singsong voice as she did . A card on top of my card ? " This covers you . " Crosswise on top ? " This crosses you . " One above ? " This crowns you . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this behind you . " She had formed a cross of cards on the table . Then rapidly she turned up four in a line to the left of the cross , saying , " Yourself , your house , your hopes , your future . " The last card was the man hanged upside down , le pendu , but from where I sat across the table he was right side up . " So much for my future . " " It can mean salvation , " she said . Her forefinger traced the line of her lower lip . Mary demanded , " Is the money there ? " " Yes  --  it 's there , " she said absently . And suddenly she gathered the cards , shuffled them over and over , and laid  | them out again , muttering her ritual under her breath . She did n't seem to study individual cards but to sec the whole group at once , and her eyes were misty and remote . A good trick , I thought , a killer at ladies ' clubs  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cool and composed and confusing . If you can hold people tense , hardly breathing , expectant for a long time , they 'll believe anything  --  not acting , so much as technique , timing . This woman was wasting her talent on traveling salesmen . But what did she want of us or of me ? Suddenly she gathered the cards , patted them square , and put them in the red box , which said : I. Muller 6 Cie , Fabrique de Cartes . " Ca n't do it , " she said . " Happens sometimes . " Mary said breathlessly , " Did you see something you do n't want to tell ? " " Oh , I 'll tell all right ! Once when I was a little girl I saw a snake change its skin , a Rocky Mountain rattler . I watched the whole thing . Well , looking at the cards , they disappeared and I saw that snake changing its skin , part dusty and ragged and part fresh and new . You figure it out . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it happen before ? " " Three times before . " " Make any sense the other times ? " " Not that I know of . " " Always the snake ? " " Oh , no ! Other things , but just as crazy . " Mary said enthusiastically , " Maybe it 's a symbol of the change in fortune that 's coming to Ethan . " " Is he a rattlesnake ? " " Oh ! I see what you mean . " " Makes me feel crawly , " Margie said . " Once I kind of liked snakes and then when I grew up I hated them . They give me the willies . I 'd better be going . " " Ethan can see you home . "  | " Would n't think of it . " " I 'd be glad to . " Margie smiled at Mary . " You keep him right here with you , " she said . " You do n't know what it 's like to be without one . " " Nonsense , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your finger . " " That 's what I did before . It 's no good . If they come that easy , they 're not worth having . Keep him home . Someone might grab him . " She got into her coat as she talked  --  a fast scrammer . " Lovely dinner . I hope you 'll ask me back . Sorry about the fortune , Ethan . " " Will we see you in church tomorrow ? " " No . I 'm going up to Montauk tonight . " " But it 's too cold and wet . " " I love the mornings on the sea up there . Good night . " She was out before I could even hold the door for her , out as though something was after her . Mary said , " I did n't know she was going up there tonight . " And I could n't tell her : Neither did she . " Ethan  --  what do you make of that fortune tonight ? " " She did n't tell one . " " You forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you make of it ? I think she saw something she did n't want to tell . Something that scared her . " " Maybe she once saw the snake and it stayed in her mind . " " You do n't think it had a  --  meaning ? " " Honey roll , you 're the fortune expert . How would I know ? " " Well , anyway , I 'm glad you do n't hate her . I thought you did . " " I 'm tricky , " I said . " I conceal my thoughts . " " Not from me you do n't . They 'll stay right through the second show . "  | " Come again ? " " The children . They always do . I thought you were wonderful about the dishes . " " I 'm devious , " I said . " And , in due course , I have designs on your honor . "  | IT HAS been my experience to put aside a decision for future pondering . Then one day , fencing a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already completed , solved , and the verdict taken . This must happen to everyone , but I have no way of knowing that . It 's as though , in the dark and desolate caves of the mind , a faceless jury had met and decided . This secret and sleepless area in me I have always thought of as black , deep , waveless water , a spawning place from which only a few forms ever rise to the surface . Or maybe it 's a great library where is recorded everything that has ever happened to living matter back to the first moment when it began to live . I think some people have closer access to this place than others  --  poets , for example . Once , when I had a paper route and no alarm clock , I worked out a way to send a signal and to get a reply . Lying in bed at night , I would see myself standing on the edge of the black water . I pictured a white stone held in my hand , a circular stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters " 4 o'clock , " then drop the stone and watch it sink , turning over and over , until it disappeared . It worked for me . On the second of four I awakened . Later I could use it to arouse inc at ten minutes of four or quarter after . And it never failed me . And then sometimes a strange , sometimes hideous thing  | thrusts up to the surface as though a sea serpent or a kraken emerged from the great depths . Only a year ago Mary 's brother Dennis died in our house , died dreadfully , of an infection of the thyroid that forced the juices of fear through him so that he was violent and terrified and fierce . His kindly Irish horse-face grew bestial . I helped to hold him down , to pacify and reassure him in his death-dreaming , and it went on for a week before his lungs began to fill . I did n't want Mary to see him die . She had never seen death , and this one , I knew , might wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother . Then , as I sat waiting by his bed , a monster swam up out of my dark water . I hated him . I wanted to kill him , to bite out his throat . My jaw muscles tightened and I think my lips fleered back like a wolf 's at the kill . When it was over , in panic guilt I confessed what I had felt to old Doc Peele , who signed the death certificate . " I do n't think it 's unusual , " he said . " I 've seen it on people 's faces , but few admit it . " " But what causes it ? I liked him . " " Maybe an old memory , " he said . " Maybe a return to the time of the pack when a sick or hurt member was a danger . Some animals and most fish tear down and eat a weakened brother . " " But I 'm not an animal  --  or a fish . " " No , you 're not . And perhaps that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all there . " He 's a good old man , Doc Peele , a tired old man . He 's birthed and buried us for fifty years . Back to that Congress in the Dark  --  it must have been working overtime . Sometimes a man seems to reverse himself so that you would say , " He ca n't do that . It 's out of character . " Maybe it 's not . It could be just another angle , or it might be that the pressures above or below have changed his shape . You see it in war a lot  --  a coward turning hero and a brave man crashing in flames . Or you read in the morning  | paper about a nice , kind family man who cuts down wife and children with an ax . I think I believe that a man is changing all the time . But there are certain moments when the change becomes noticeable . If I wanted to dig deep enough , I could probably trace the seeds of my change right back to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a pattern of larger things . It 's as though events and experiences nudged and jostled me in a direction contrary to my normal one or the one I had come to think was normal  --  the direction of the grocery clerk , the failure , the man without real hope or drive , barred in by responsibilities for filling the bellies and clothing the bodies of his family , caged by habits and attitudes I thought of as being moral , even virtuous . And it may be that I had a smugness about being what I called a " Good Man . " And surely I knew what was going on around me . Marullo did n't have to tell me . You ca n't live in a town the size of New Baytown and not know . I did n't think about it much . Judge Dorcas fixed traffic tickets for favors . It was n't even secret . And favors call for favors . The Town Manager , who was also Budd Building Supplies , sold equipment to the township at a high price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved street went in , it usually turned out that Mr. Baker and Marullo and half a dozen other business leaders had bought up the lots before the plan was announced . These were just facts of nature , but I had always believed they were n't facts of my nature . Marullo and Mr. Baker and the drummer and Margie Young-Hunt and Joey Morphy in a concentration had been nudging me and altogether it amounted to a push , so that " I 've got to put aside a little time to think it out . " My darling was purring in her sleep , with the archaic smile on her lips , and she had the extra glow of comfort and solace she gets after love , a calm fulfilledness . I should have been sleepy after wandering around the  | night before , but I was n't . I 've noticed that I am rarely sleepy if I know I can sleep long in the morning . The red dots were swimming on my eyes , and the street light threw the shadows of naked elm branches on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cradles because the spring wind was blowing . The window was open halfway and the white curtains swelled and filled like sails on an anchored boat . Mary must have white curtains and often washed . They give her a sense of decency and security . She pretends a little anger when I tell her it 's her lace-curtain Irish soul . I felt good and fulfilled too , but whereas Mary dives for sleep , I did n't want to go to sleep . I wanted to go on fully tasting how good I felt . I wanted to think about the I Love America Essay Contest my offspring were entering . But behind these and others , I wanted to consider what was happening to me and what to do about it , so naturally I got out the last thing first and I found that the dark jury of the deep had already decided for me . There it was , laid out and certain . It was like training for a race and preparing and finally being down at start with your spikes set in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol cracks . I found I was ready with my spikes set , waiting only for the shot . And apparently I was the last to know . All day people had remarked that I looked well , by that meaning I looked different , more confident , changed . That drummer had a look of shock in the afternoon . Marullo had inspected me uneasily . And Joey-boy felt the need to apologize for something I had done . Then Margie Young-Hunt  --  maybe she was the sharpest with her rattlesnake dream . Some way she had penetrated and discovered a certainty about me before I was certain of it . And the symbol was a rattlesnake . I found I was grinning in the dark . And afterward , confused , she used the oldest trick  --  the threat of infidelity , a bait cast in a flowing tide to find what fish are feeding there . I did n't remember the secret whisper of her hidden body  --  no , the picture  | was of her clawed hands that showed age and nervousness and the cruelty that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I wish I knew the nature of night thoughts . They 're close kin to dreams . Sometimes I can direct them , and other times they take their head and come rushing over me like strong , unmanaged horses . Danny Taylor came in . I did n't want to think about him and be sad but he came anyway . I had to use a trick a tough old sergeant taught me once , and it works . There was a day and a night and a day in the war that was all one piece , one unit of which the parts were just about all the dirty dreadfulness that can happen in that sick business . ' While it was going on I 'm not sure I knew its agony because I was busy and unutterably tired , but afterward that unit of a day and a night and a day came back to me over and over again in my night thoughts until it was like that insanity they call battle fatigue and once named shell-shock . I used every trick I could not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . It waited through the day to get at me in the dark . Once mawkish with whisky I told it to my top sergeant , an old pro who had been in wars we have forgotten ever happened . If he had worn his ribbons , there 'd have been no room for buttons  --  Mike Pulaski , a polack from Chicago , no relation to the hero . By good fortune , he was decently drunk or he might have clammed up out of a conditioned conviction about fraternizing with an officer . Mike heard me out , staring at a spot between my eyes . " Yeah ! " he said . " I know about that . Trouble is , a guy tries to shove it out of his head . That do n't work . What you got to do is kind of welcome it . " " How do you mean , Mike ? " " Take it 's something kind of long  --  you start at the beginning and remember everything you can , right to the end . Every time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | through the finish . Pretty soon it 'll get tired and pieces of it will go , and before long the whole thing will go . " I tried it and it worked . I do n't know whether the headshrinkers know this but they should . When Danny Taylor came into my night I gave him Sergeant Mike 's treatment . When we were kids together , same age , same size , same weight , we used to go to the grain and feed store on I-Iigh Street and get on the scales . One week I 'd be half a pound heavier and the next Danny would catch up with me . We used to fish and hunt and swim together and go out with the same girls . Danny 's family was well fixed like most of the old families of New Baytown . The Taylor house is that white one with the tall fluted columns on Porlock Street . Once the Taylors had a country house too  --  about three miles from town . The country all around us is rolling hills covered with trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hickory and some cedars . Once , long before I was born , the oaks were monsters , so big that the local-built ships had cut their keels and ribs and planking within a short distance of the shipyards until it was all gone . In this rolypoly country the Taylors once had a house set in the middle of a big meadow , the only level place for miles around . It must once have been a lake bottom because it was flat as a table and surrounded by low hills . Maybe sixty years ago , the Taylor house burned down and was never rebuilt . As kids Danny and I used to ride out there on bicycles . We played in the stone cellar and built a hunting lodge of bricks from the old foundation . The gardens must have been wonderful . We could see avenues of trees and a suggestion of formal hedges and borders among the scrabble of the returned forest . Here and there would be a stretch of stone balustrade , and once we found a bust of Pan on a tapering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its horns and  | beard in the sandy loam . We stood it up and cleaned it and celebrated it for a time , but greed and girls got the better of us . We finally carted it into Floodhampton and sold it to a junk man for five dollars . It must have been a good piece , maybe an old one . Danny and I were friends as all boys must have friends . Then his appointment to the Naval Academy came through . I saw him once in uniform and not again for years . New Baytown was and is a tight , close-made town . Everyone knew Danny was expelled and no one discussed it . Taylors died out , well , just as Ilawleys died out . I 'm the only one left , and , of course , Allen , my son . Danny did n't come back until they were all dead , and he came back a drunk . At first I tried to help but he did n't want me . He did n't want anybody . But , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over everything I could remember right up to that very morning when I gave him the dollar to let him find his local oblivion . The structure of my change was feeling , pressures from without , Mary 's wish , Allen 's desires , Ellen 's anger , Mr. Baker 's help . Only at the last when the move is mounted and prepared does thought place a roof on the building and bring in words to explain and to justify . Suppose my humble and interminable clerkship was not virtue at all but a moral laziness ? For any success , boldness is required . Perhaps I was simply timid , fearful of consequences  --  in a word , lazy . Successful business in our town is not complicated or obscure and it is not widely successful either , because its practicers have set artificial limits for their activities . Their crimes are little crimes and so their success is small success . If the town government and the business complex of New Baytown were ever deeply investigated it would be found that a hundred legal and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations  --  petty larceny . They abolished part of the Decalogue and kept the rest . And  | when one of our successful men had what he needed or wanted , he reassumed his virtue as easily as changing his shirt , and for all one could see , he took no hurt from his derelictions , always assuming that he did n't get caught . Did any of them think about this ? I do n't know . And if small crimes could be condoned by self , why not a quick , harsh , brave one ? Is murder by slow , steady pressure any less murder than a quick and merciful knife-thrust ? I do n't feel guilt for the German lives I took . Suppose for a limited time I abolished all the rules , not just some of them . Once the objective was reached , could they not all be reassumed ? There is no doubt that business is a kind of war . Why not , then , make it all-out war in pursuit of peace ? Mr. Baker and his friends did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his structure collapsed they inherited . And is n't that a kind of murder ? Have any of the great fortunes we admire been put together without ruthlessness ? I ca n't think of any . And if I should put the rules aside for a time , I knew I would wear scars but would they be worse than the scars of failure I was wearing ? To be alive at all is to have scars . All this wondering was the weather vane on top of the building of unrest and of discontent . It could be done because it had been done . But if I opened up that door , could I ever get it closed again ? I did not know . I could not know until I had opened it . . . . Did Mr. Baker know ? Had Mr. Baker even thought of it ? . . . Old Cap'n thought the Bakers burned the Belle-Adair for the insurance . Could that and my father 's misfortune be the reason Mr. Baker wanted to help me ? Were these his scars ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and bunted and shoved about and pulled around by many small tugs . Once turned by tide and tugs , it must set a new course and start its engines turning . On the bridge which is the planning center , the question must  | be asked : All right , I know now where I want to go . How do I get there , and where are lurking rocks and what will the weather be ? One fatal reef I knew was talk . So many betray themselves before they are betrayed , with a kind of wistful hunger for glory , even the glory of punishment . Andersen 's Well is the only confidant to trust  --  Andersen 's Well . I called out to old Cap'n . " Shall I set the course , sir ? Is it a good course ? Will it get me there ? " And for the first time he denied me his command . " You 'll have to work it out yourself . What 's good for one is bad for another , and you wo n't know till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , but perhaps it would n't have made any difference . No one wants advice ? only corroboration .  | V V FIEN I awakened , old sleepy Mary was up and gone and coffee and bacon were afoot . I could smell them . And you 'd have to search for a better day for a resurrection , a green and blue and yellow day . From the bedroom window I could see that everything was resurrecting , grass , trees . They chose a proper season for it . I put on my Christmas dressing gown and my birthday slippers . In the bathroom I found some of Allen 's hair goo and slicked it on , so that my combed and brushed scalp felt tight like a cap . Easter Sunday breakfast is an orgy of eggs and pancakes , and bacon curling about everything . I crept up on Mary and patted her silk-covered fanny and said , " Kyrie eleison ! " " Oh ! " she said . " I did n't hear you coming . " She regarded my dressing gown , paisley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't wear it enough . " " I have n't time . I have n't had time . " " Well , it 's nice , " she said . " Ought to be . You picked it . Are the kids sleeping through these wonderful smells ? " " Oh , no . They 're out back , hiding eggs . I wonder what Mr. Baker wants . " The quick jump never fails to startle me . " Mr. Baker , Mr. Baker . Oh ! He probably wants to help me start my fortune . "  | " Did you tell him ? About the cards ? " " Course not , darling . But maybe he guessed . " Then I said seriously , " Look , cheesecake , you do think I have a great business brain , do n't you ? " " What do you mean ? " She had a pancake up for turning , and it stayed up . " Mr. Baker thinks I should invest your brother 's legacy . " " Well , if Mr. Baker ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That 's your money and your safety . " " Does n't Mr. Baker know more about that than you do , dear ? " " I 'm not sure . All I know is my father thought he knew . That 's why I 'm working for Marullo . " " Still , I think Mr. Baker ? " " Will you be guided by me , sweetheart ? " " Well , of course ? " " In everything ? " " Are you being silly ? " " I 'm dead serious  --  dead ! " " I believe you are . But you ca n't go around doubting Mr. I Baker . Why , he 's  --  he 's ? " " Ile 's Mr. Baker . We 'll listen to what he has to say and then  --  I still will want that money right in the bank where it is . " Allen shot through the back door as though fired by a slingshot . " Marullo , " he said . " Mr. Marullo 's outside . He wants to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , ask him in . " " I did . I Ic wants to see you outside . " " Ethan , what is it ? You ca n't go out in your robe . It 's Easter Sunday . " " Allen , " I said , " you tell Mr. Marullo I 'm not dressed . Tell him he can come back later . But if he 's in a hurry , he  | can come in the front door if he wants to see me alone . " He dashed . " I do n't know what he wants . Maybe the store 's been robbed . " Allen shot back . " He 's going around front . " " Now , dear , do n't you let him spoil your breakfast , you hear me ? " I went through the house and opened the front door . Marullo was on the porch , dressed in his best for Easter mass , and his best was black broadcloth and big gold watch chain . He held his black hat in his hand and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come in . " " No , " he said . " I just got one word to say . I heard how that fella offered you a kickback . " " Yes ? " " I heard how you threw him out . " " Who told you ? " " I ca n't tell . " He smiled again . " Well , what about it ? You trying to say I should have taken it ? " He stepped forward and shook my hand , pumped it up and down twice very formally . " You 're a good fella , " he said . " Maybe he did n't offer enough . " " You kidding ? You 're a good fella . That 's all . You 're a good fella . " He reached in his bulging side pocket and brought out a bag . " You take this . " He patted my shoulder and then in a welter of embarrassment turned and fled ; his short legs pumped him away and his fat neck flamed where it bulged over his stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in the bag  --  colored candy Easter eggs . We had a big square glass jar of them at the store . " He brought a present for the kids , " I said .  | " Marullo ? Brought a present . I ca n't believe it . " " Well , he did . " " Why ? He never did anything like that . " " I guess he just plain loves me . " " Is there something I do n't know ? " " Duck blossom , there are eight million things none of us know . " The children were staring in from the open back door . I held out the bag to them . " A present from an admirer . Do n't get into them until after breakfast . " As we were getting dressed for church , Mary said , " I wish I knew what that was all about . " " Marullo ? I 'll have to admit , darling , I wish I knew what it was all about too . " " But a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a grave simplicity ? " " I do n't understand . " " his wife is dead . He has neither chick nor child . He 's getting old . Maybe  --  well , maybe he 's lonely . " " He never has been here before . While he 's lonesome , you should ask him for a raise . He does n't drop in on Mr. Baker . It makes me nervous . " I gauded myself like the flowers of the field , decent dark suit , my burying black , shirt and collar so starchly white they threw the sun 's light back in the sun 's face , cerulean tie with cautious polka dots . Was Mrs. Margie Young-Hunt whomping up ancestral storms ? Where did Marullo get his information ? It could only be Mr. Bugger to Mrs. Young-Hunt to Mr. Marullo . I do not trust thee Margie Young , the reason why I can not tongue . But this I know and know right spung , I do not trust thee Mrs. Young . And with that singing in my head I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter buttonhole . In the angle made by the foundation and the sloping cellar door there is a protected place , the earth warmed by  | the furnace and exposed to every scrap of winter sunlight . There white violets grow , brought from the cemetery where they grow wild over the graves of my ancestors . I picked three tiny lion-faced blossoms for my buttonhole and gathered a round dozen for my darling , set their own pale leaves about them for a nosegay , and bound them tight with a bit of aluminum foil from the kitchen . " Why , they 're lovely , " Mary said . " Wait till I get a pin , I 'll wear them . " " They 're the first  --  the very first , my creamy fowl . I am your slave . Christ is risen . All 's right with the world . " " Please do n't be silly about sacred things , dear . " " What in the world have you done with your hair ? " " Do you like it ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was n't sure you 'd like it . Margie said you 'd never notice . Wait till I tell her you did . " She set a bowl of flowers on her head , the yearly vernal offering to Eostre . " Like it ? " " I love it . " - Now the young got their inspection , ears , nostrils , shoeshines , every detail , and they resisted every moment of it . Allen 's hair was so plastered that he could hardly blink . The heels of his shoes were unpolished but with infinite care he had trained a line of hair to roll on his crested brow like a summer wave . Ellen was girl of a giriness . All in sight was in order . I tried my luck again . " Ellen , " I said , " you 're doing something different with your hair . It becomes you . Mary , darling , do n't you like it ? " " Oh ! She 's beginning to take pride , " Mary said . We formed a procession down our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where our church is , our old whitesteepled church , stolen intact from Christopher Wren . And we were part of a growing stream , and every woman in passing had delight of other women 's hats .  | " I have designed an Easter hat , " I said . " A simple , offthe-face crown of thorns in gold with real ruby droplets on the forehead . " " Ethan ! " said Mary sternly . " Suppose someone should hear you . " " No , I guess it could n't be popular . " " I think you 're horrid , " Mary said , and so did I , worse than horrid . But I did wonder how Mr. Baker would respond to comment on his hair . Our family rivulet joined other streams and passed stately greetings and the stream was a river pouring into St. Thomas 's Episcopal Church , a medium-high church , maybe a little higher than center . When the time comes that I must impart the mysteries of life to my son , which I have no doubt he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed with a kindly word for hair , he will go as far as his concupiscent little heart desires . I must warn him , however . He may kick , beat , drop , tousle , or bump them , but he must never  --  never ? mess their hair . With this knowledge he can be king . The Bakers were just ahead of us going up the steps , and we passed decorous greetings . " I believe we 're seeing you at tea . " " Yes , indeed . A very happy Easter to you . " " Can that be Allen ? How he 's grown . And Mary Ellen . Well , I ca n't keep track  --  they shoot up so . " There 's something very dear about a church you grew II in . I know every secret corner , secret odor of St. Thomas 's . In that font I was christened , at that rail confirmed , in that pew Hawleys have sat for God knows how long , and that is no figure of speech . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every desecration , and there were plenty of them . I think I can go to every place where my initials are scratched with a nail . When Danny Taylor and I punched the letters of a singularly dirty word with a pin in the Book of Common Prayer , Mr.  | Wheeler caught us and we were punished , but they had to go through all the prayerbooks and the hymnals to make sure there were n't more . Once , in that chair stall under the lectern , a dreadful thing happened . I wore the lace and carried the cross and sang a beefy soprano . Once the bishop was officiating , a nice old man , hairless as a boiled onion , but to me glowing with rays of holiness . So it was that , stunned with inspiration , I set the cross in its socket at the end of processional and forgot to throw the brass latch that held it in . At the reading of the second lesson I saw with horror the heavy brass cross sway and crash on that holy hairless head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lost the lace to a boy who could n't sing as well , a boy named Skunkfoot Hill . He 's an anthropologist now , somewhere in the West . The incident seemed to prove to me that intentions , good or bad , are not enough . There 's luck or fate or something else that takes over accidents . We sat the service through and heard the news announced that Christ was risen indeed . It ran shivers up my spine as always . I took communion with a good heart . Allen and Mary Ellen were n't yet confirmed and they got pretty restless and had to be given the iron eye to stop their jittering . When Mary 's eyes are hostile , they can pierce even the armor plate of adolescence . Then in the drenching sunshine we shook hands and greeted and shook hands and wished the season 's best to the community of our neighbors . All those we had spoken to coming in , we regreeted going out  --  a continuation of the litany , of a continuous litany in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed and to be respected . " Good morning . And how are you this fine day ? " " Very well , thank you . How is your mother ? " " She 's getting old  --  getting old  --  the aches and daggers of getting old . I 'll tell her you asked for her . "  | The words are meaningless except in terms of feeling . Does anyone act as the result of thought or does feeling stimulate action and sometimes thought implement it ? Ahead of our small parade in the sun went Mr. Baker , avoiding stepping on cracks ; his mother , dead these twenty years , was safe from a broken back . And Mrs. Baker , Amelia , tripping along beside him , trying to match his uneven stride with her fluttering feet , a small , bright-eyed bird of a woman , but a seed-eating bird . Allen , my son , walked beside his sister , but each of them tried to give the impression that they were total strangers . I think she despises him and he detests her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceal it in a rose cloud of loving words . Give them their lunches , my sister , my wife ? their hard-boiled eggs and pickles , their jelly-and-peanutbutter sandwiches , their red barrel-smelling apples , and turn them free in the world to spawn . And that 's just what she did . They walked away , carrying their paper bags , each one to a separate private world . " Did you enjoy the service , my darling ? " " Oh , yes ! I always do . But you  --  sometimes I wonder if you believe  --  no , I mean it . Well , your jokes  --  sometimes ? " " Pull up your chair , my dimply darling . " " I have to get lunch on . " " Bugger lunch . " " That 's what I mean . Your jokes . " " Lunch is not sacred . If it were warmer , I could carry you to a rowboat and we would go out past the breakwater and fish for porgies . " " We 're going to the Bakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church or not , Ethan ? Why do you call me silly names ? You hardly ever use my name . " " To avoid being repetitious and tiresome , but in my heart your name rings like a bell . Do I believe ? What a question ! Do I lift out each shining phrase from the Nicene creed , loaded like a shotgun shell , and inspect it ? No . It  | is n't necessary . It 's a singular thing , Mary . If my mind and soul and body were as dry of faith as a navy bean , the words , The Lord is my Shepherd , I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures , ' would still make my stomach turn over and put a flutter in my chest and light a fire in my brain . " " I do n't understand . " " Good girl .

Ellen , only last night , asked , Daddy , when will we be rich ? ' But I did not say to her what I know : We will be rich soon , and you who handle poverty badly will handle riches equally badly . ' And that is true . In poverty she is envious . In riches she may be a snob . Money does not change the sickness , only the symptoms . " " You talk this way about your own children . What must you say of me ? " " I say you are a blessing , a dearling , the brightness in a foggy life . " " You sound drunk  --  anyway intoxicated . " " I am . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are smelling it , sweetheart . " " What 's come over you ? " " Ah ! you do know , do n't you ? A change  --  a bloody big storm of a change . You are only feeling the outmost waves . " " You worry me , Ethan . You really do . You 're wild . " " Do you remember my decorations ? " " Your medals  --  from the war ? " " They were awarded for wildness  --  for wilderness . No  | man on earth ever had less murder in his heart than I. But they made another box and crammed me in it . The times , the moment , demaMded that I slaughter human beings and del I did . " ' " That was wartime and for your country . " " It 's always some kind of time . So far I have avoided my own time . I was a goddam good soldier , potkin  --  clever and quick and merciless , an effective unit for wartime . Maybe I could be an equally efficient unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me something . " " Sadly enough , I am . And it sounds in my ears like an apology . I hope it is not . " " I 'm going to set out lunch . " " Not hungry after that nor'easter of a breakfast . " " Well , you can nibble something . Did you see Mrs. Baker 's hat ? She must have got it in New York . " " What has she done with her hair ? " " You noticed that ? It 's almost strawberry . " r " To be a light to lighten the gentiles , and to be the glory of thy peo-ple Israel . ' " " Why would Margie want to go to Montauk this time of year ? " " She loves the early morning . " " She 's not an early riser . I joke with her about that . And do n't you think it was queer , Marullo bringing candy eggs ? " " Do you connect the two events ? Margie gets up early and Marullo brings eggs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . For once I 'm not . If I tell you a secret , will you promise not to tell ? " " It 's a joke ! " " No . " " Well , I promise . " " I think Marullo is going to make a trip to Italy . " " How do you know ? Did he tell you ? "  | " Not exactly . I put things together . I put things together . " " But that 'll leave you alone in the store . You 'll have to get someone to help you . " " I can handle it . " " You do practically everything now . You 'll have to get someone in to help . " " Remember  --  it is n't sure and it 's a secret . " " Oh , I never forget a promise . " " But you 'll hint . " " Ethan , I will not . " " Do you know what you are ? A dear little baby rabbit with flowers on your head . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshen up . When she was gone , I sprawled out in my chair and I heard in my secret ears , " Lord , now lettest Thou Thy servant de-part in pee-ace , according to Thy word . " And darned if I did n't go to sleep . Dropped off a cliff into the dark , right there in the living room . I do n't do that often . And because I had been thinking of Danny Taylor , I dreamed of Danny Taylor . We were not small or great but grown , and we were at the flat dry lake-bottom with the old house foundations and cellar hole . And it was early summer , for I remarked the fatness of the leaves and the grass so heavy that it bent of its weight , the kind of day that makes you feel fat and crazy too . Danny went behind a young juniper straight and slender as a column . I heard his voice , distorted and thick like words spoken under water . Then I was with him and he was melting and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smooth him upward , back in place , the way you try to smooth wet cement when it runs out of the form , but I could n't . His essence ran between my fingers . They say a dream is a moment . This one went on and on and the more I tried , the more he melted.  | When Mary awakened me I was panting with effort . " Spring fever , " she said . " That 's the first sign . When I was a growing girl , I slept so much my mother sent for Doctor Grady . She thought I had sleeping sickness , but I was only growing in the spring . " " I had a daymare . I would n't wish a dream like that on anyone . " " It 's all the confusion . Go up and comb your hair and wash your face . You look tired , dear . Are you all right ? It 's nearly time to go . You slept two hours . You must have needed it . I wish I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will , darling . And promise me you will listen to every word . " " But he might want a word alone with you . Businessmen do n't like ladies listening . " " Well , he ca n't have it that way . I want you there . " " You know I have no experience in business . " " I know  --  but it 's your money he 'll be talking about . " You ca n't know people like the Bakers unless you are born knowing them . Acquaintance , even friendship , is a different matter . I know them because Hawleys and Bakers were alike in blood , place of origin , experience , and past fortune . This makes for a kind of nucleus walled and moated against outsiders . When my father lost our money , I was not edged completely out . I am still acceptable as a Hawley to Bakers for perhaps my lifetime because they feel related to me . But I am a poor relation . Gentry without money gradually cease to be gentry . Without money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his son will be an outsider , no matter what his name and antecedents . We have become ranchers without land , commanders without troops , horsemen on foot . We ca n't survive . Perhaps that is one reason why the change was taking place in me . I do not Want , never have wanted , money for itself . But money is  | necessary to keep my place in a category I am used to and comfortable in . All this must have worked itself out in the dark place below my thinking level . It emerged not as a thought but as a conviction . " Good afternoon , " Mrs. Baker said . " So glad you could come . You 've neglected us , Mary . Has n't it been a glorious day ? Did you enjoy the service ? For a clergyman I think he 's such an interesting man . " " We do n't see you nearly often enough , " Mr. Baker said . " I remember your grandfather sitting in that very chair and reporting that the dirty Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only it was n't tea . Old Cap'n Hawley used to lace his rum with a little tea . He was a truculent man , some thought a quarrelsome man . " I could see that Mary was first shaken and then pleased at this warmth . Of course she did n't know I had promoted her to be an heiress . A reputation for money is almost as negotiable as money itself . Mrs. Baker , her head jerking with some nervous disorder , poured tea into cups as thin and fragile as magnolia petals , and her pouring hand was the only steady part of her . Mr. Baker stirred with a thoughtful spoon . " I do n't know whether I love tea or the ceremony of it , " he said . " I like all ceremonies  --  even the silly ones . " " I think I understand , " I said . " This morning I felt comfortable in the service because it had no surprises . I knew the words before they were said . " " During the war , Ethan  --  listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember anything like it  --  during the war I served as a consultant to the Secretary of War . I spent some time in Washington . " " I hated it , " said Mrs. Baker . " Well , there was a big military tea , a real doozer , maybe five hundred guests . The ranking lady was the wife of a five-star general and next in importance was the lady of  | a lieutenant general . Mrs. Secretary , the hostess , asked the five-star lady to pour the tea and Mrs. Three-Stars to pour coffee . Well , the top lady refused because , and I quote her , Everyone knows coffee outranks tea . ' Now , did you ever hear that ? " He chuckled . " As it turned out , whisky outranked everybody . " " It was such a restless place , " Mrs. Baker said . " People moved before they had time to gather a set of habits , or manners . " Mary told her story of an Irish tea in Boston with the water boiling in round tubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And they do n't steep . They boil , " she said . " That tea will unsettle varnish on a table . " There must be ritual preliminaries to a serious discussion or action , and the sharper the matter is , the longer and lighter must the singing be . Each person must add a bit of feather or a colored patch . If Mary and Mrs. Baker were not to be a part of the serious matter , they would long since have set up their own pattern of exchange . Mr. Baker had poured wine on the earth of conversation and so had my Mary , and she was pleased and excited by their attentiveness . It remained for Mrs. Baker and for me to contribute and I felt it only decent to be last . She took her turn and drew her source from the teapot ; l 1i , as the others had . " I remember when there were dozens of kinds of tea , " she offered brightly . " Why , everyone had recipes for nearly everything . I guess there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't made into some kind of tea . Now there are only two , India and China , and not much China . Remember tansy and camomile and orangeleaf and flower  --  and  --  and cambric ? " " What 's cambric ? " Mary asked . " Equal parts hot water and hot milk . Children love it . It does n't taste like milk and water . " That accounted for Mrs. Baker .  | It was my turn , and I intended to make a few carefully meaningless remarks about the Boston Tea Party , but you ca n't always do what you intended . Surprises slip out , not waiting for permission . " I went to sleep after service , " I heard me say . " I dreamed of Danny Taylor , a dreadful dream . You remember Danny . " " Poor chap , " said Mr. Baker . " Once we were closer than brothers . I had no brother . I guess we were brothers in a way . I do n't carry it out , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mary was annoyed with me for breaking the pattern of the conversation . She took a small revenge . " Ethan gives him money . I do n't think it 's right . He just uses it to get drunk . " " Wellll ! " said Mr. Baker . " I wonder  --  anyway the dream was a noonmare . I give him so little  --  a dollar now and then . What else can he do with a dollar but get drunk ? Maybe with a decent amount he could get well . " " No one would dare do that , " Mary cried . " That would be after killing him . Is n't that so , Mr. Baker ? " " Poor chap , " Mr. Baker said . " A fine family the Taylors were . It makes me sick to see him this way . But Mary 's right . He 'd probably drink himself to death . " " He is anyway . But he 's safe from me . I do n't have a decent amount to give him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mrs. Baker contributed a feminine savagery : " He should be in an institution where they could look after him . " All three were annoyed with me . I should have stayed with the Boston Tea Party . Strange how the mind goes romping , playing blindman 's buff or **26;450;TOOLONG when it should be using every observation to find a path through the minefield of  | secret plans and submerged obstacles . I understood the house of Baker and the house of Hawley , the dark walls and curtains , the funereal rubber plants unacquainted with sun ; the portraits and prints and remembrances of other times in pottery and scrimshaw , in fabrics and wood which bolt it to reality and to permanence . Chairs change with style and comfort but chests and tables , bookcases and desks , relate to a solid past . Hawley was more than a family . It was a house . And that was why poor Danny held onto Taylor Meadow . Without it , no family  --  and soon not even a name . By tone and inflection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be that some men require a house and a history to reassure themselves that they exist  --  it 's a slim enough connection , at most . In the store I was a failure and a clerk , in my house I was Hawley , so I too must be unsure . Baker could offer a hand to Hawley . Without my house , I too would have been canceled . It was not man to man but house to house . I resented the removal from real of Danny Taylor , but I could n't stop it . And this thought sharpened and tempered me . Baker was going to try to refurbish Hawley for Baker 's participation in Mary 's fancied inheritance . Now I was on the edge of the minefield . My heart hardened against my selfless benefactor . I felt it harden and grow wary and dangerous . And with its direction came the feeling of combat , and the laws of controlled savagery , and the first law is : Let even your defense have the appearance of attack . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the background . You know better than I do the slow , precise way in which my father lost the Hawley substance . I was away at war . I-low did it happen ? " " It was n't his intention , but his judgment ? " " I know he was unworldly  --  but how did it happen ? " " Well , it was a time of wild investment . He invested wildly . " " Did he have any advice ? "  | " He put money in munitions that were already obsolete . Then when the contracts were canceled , he lost . " " You were in Washington . Did you know about the con-tracts ? " " Only in a general way . " " But enough so you did n't invest . " " No , I did n't . " " Did you advise my father about investments ? " " I was in Washington . " " But you knew he had borrowed the money on the Hawley property , the money to invest ? " " Yes , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was in Washington . " " But your bank foreclosed . " " A bank does n't have any choice , Ethan . You know that . " " Yes , I know . Only it 's a shame you could n't have advised him . " " You should n't blame him , Ethan . " " Now that I understand it , I do n't . I did n't mean to blame him , but I never quite knew what happened . " I think Mr. Baker had prepared an opening . Having lost his chance , he had to grope about for his next move . He coughed , blew his nose and wiped it with a paper handkerchief from a flat pocket package , wiped his eyes with a second sheet , polished his glasses with a third . Everyone has his own method for gaining time . I 've known a man to take five minutes to fill and light a pipe . When he was ready again , I said , " I know I have no right in myself to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long partnership of our families . " " Good people , " he said . " And usually men of excellent judgment , conservative ? " " But not blindly so , sir . I believe that once they decided on a course they drove through . "  | " That they did . " " Even if it came to sinking an enemy  --  or burning a ship ? " " They were commissioned , of course . " " In i8oi , I believe , sir , they were questioned about what constituted an enemy . " " There 's always some readjustment after a war . " " Surely . But I 'm not taking up old scores for talk . Frankly , Mr. Baker , I want to  --  to rehabilitate my fortunes . " " That 's the spirit , Ethan . For a time I thought you 'd lost the old Hawley touch . " " I had ; or maybe I 'd not developed it . You 've offered help . Where do I start ? " " The trouble is , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I had some capital , where would I start ? " " This must be tiresome for the ladies , " he said . " Maybe we should go into the library . Business is dull to ladies . " Mrs. Baker stood up . " I was just about to ask Mary to help me select some wallpaper for the big bedroom . The samples are upstairs , Mary . " " I 'd like Mary to hear ? " But she went along with them , as I knew she would . " I do n't know a thing about business , " she said . " But I do know about wallpaper . " " But you 're concerned , darling . " " I just get mixed up , Ethan . You know I do . " " Maybe I 'll get more mixed up without you , darling . " Mr. Baker had probably suggested the wallpaper bit . I think his wife does not choose the paper . Surely no woman picked the dark and geometric paper in the room where we sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , " your problem is capital , Ethan . Your house is clear . You can mortgage it . " I wo n't do that . "  | " Well , I can respect that , but it 's the only collateral you have . There is also Mary 's money . It 's not much , but with some money you can get more money . " " I do n't want to touch her money . That 's her safety . " " It 's in a joint account and it 's not earning anything . " " Let 's say I overcame my scruples . What have you in mind ? " " Have you any idea what her mother 's worth ? " " No  --  but it seems substantial . " He cleaned his glasses with great care . " What I say is bound to be in confidence . " " Of course . " " Fortunately I know you are not a talker . No Hawley ever was , except perhaps your father . Now , I know as a businessman that New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it grow  --  a harbor , beaches , inland waters . Once it starts , nothing can stop it . A good businessman owes it to his town to help it develop . " " And take a profit . " " Naturally . " " Why has n't it developed ? " " I think you know that  --  the mossbacks on the council . They 're living in the past . They hold back progress . " It always interested me to hear how philanthropic the taking of a profit can be . Stripped of its forward-looking , good-of-the-community clothing , Mr. Baker 's place was just what it had to be . He and a few others , a very few , would support the town 's present administrations until they had bought or controlled all the future facilities . Then they would turn the council and the Town Manager out and let progress reign , and only then would it be discovered that they owned every avenue through which it could come . From pure sentiment , he was willing to cut me in for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had intended to let me know the timetable , or whether his enthusiasm got the better of him , but it did come through the generalities . The  | town election is July seventh . By that time , the forwardlooking group must have the wheels of progress under control . I do n't suppose there is a man in the world who does n't love to give advice . As I maintained a small reluctance , my teacher grew more vehement and more specific . " I 'll have to think about it , sir , " I said . " What 's easy for you is a mystery to me . And of course I 'll have to discuss it with Mary . " " Now that 's where I think you 're wrong , " he said . " There 's too much petticoat in business today . " " But it 's her inheritance . " " Best thing you can do for her is make her some money for a surprise . They like it better that way . " " I hope I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll just have to mull it over . Did you hear Marullo is going to Italy ? " His eyes sharpened . " For good ? " " No , just a visit . " " Well , I hope he makes some arrangement to protect you in case something happened to him . He 's not a young man . Has he made a will ? " " I do n't know . " " If a bunch of his wop relations moved in , you might find yourself out of a job . " I retired into a protective vagueness . " You 've given me a lot to chew on , " I said . " But I wonder if you can give me some little idea of when you will start . " " I can tell you this : Development is pretty much dependent on transportation . " " Well , the big thruways are moving out . " " Still a long way to come . The kind of men with the kind of money we want to attract will want to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That 's right . "  | " Furthermore , we have no place for an airport without pushing hills around . " " An expensive operation . The cost of labor would be prohibitive . " " Then what is your plan ? " " Ethan , you 'll have to trust me and forgive me . I ca n't tell you that at this time . But I do promise that if you can raise some capital , I 'll see that you get in on the ground floor . And I can tell you that there is a very definite situation , but it has to be solved . " " Well , I guess that 's better than I deserve . " " The old families must stick together . " " Is Marullo part of the group ? " " Certainly not . He goes his own way with his own crowd . " " They do pretty well , do n't they ? " " Better than I think is healthy . I do n't like to see these foreigners creeping in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did I say that ? " " No , I guess I just imagined it . " " You must have . " And with that Mary came back from the wallpaper . We did our courteous duties and walked slowly toward home . " They just could n't have been nicer . What did he say ? " " Same old thing . I should use your money to get a start , and I wo n't do it . " " I know you 're thinking of me , dear . But I say if you do n't take his advice you 're a fool . " " I do n't like it , Mary . Suppose he 's wrong . You 'd be without protection . " " I tell you this , Ethan , if you do n't do it , I 'll take the money and hand it over to him . I promise you I will . " " Let me think about it . I do n't want to involve you in business . "  | " You do n't have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the fortune said . " " Oh , Lord  --  the fortune again . " " Well , I believe it . " " If I lost your money , you 'd hate me . " " I would n't . You are my fortune ! That 's what Margie said . " " What Margie said , is in my head , in letters red , until I 'm dead . " " Do n't make a joke . " " Maybe I 'm not . Do n't let fortune spoil the sweetness of our failure . " " I do n't see how a little money could spoil anything . Not a lot of money  --  just enough . " I did n't answer . " Well ? do you ? " I said , " 0 prince 's daughter , there is no such thing as just enough money . Only two measures : No Money and Not Enough Money . " " Why , that 's not true . " " That is true . Remember the Texas billionaire who died recently ? He lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left no will , no heirs , but he did n't have enough money . The more you have , the less enough it is . " She said sarcastically , " I suppose you find it sinful for me to want new living-room curtains and a water heater big enough so four people can bathe the same day and I can wash dishes too . " " I was not reporting on sin , you juggins . I was stating a fact , a law of nature . " " You seem to have no respect for human nature . " " Not human nature , my Mary  --  nature . Squirrels bank ten times as many hickory nuts as they can ever use . The pocket gopher , with a stomach full to bursting , still loads his cheeks like sacks . And how much of the honey the clever bees collect do the clever bees eat ? " When Mary is confused or perplexed , she spurts anger  | the way an octopus spurts ink , and hides in the dark cloud of it . " You make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let anyone have a little happiness . " " My darling , it is n't that . It 's a despairing unhappiness I 'm afraid of , the panic money brings , the protectiveness and the envy . " She must have been unconsciously fearful of the same thing . She struck at me , probed for a hurting place , and found it and twisted the jagged words . " Here 's a grocery clerk without a bean worried about how bad it will be when he 's rich . You act as though you could pick up a fortune any time you want to . " " I think I can . " " How ? " " That 's the worry . " " You do n't know how or you 'd have done it before . You 're just bluffing . You always bluff . " The intent to wound raises rage . I could feel the fever rise in me . Ugly , desperate words moved up like venom . I felt a sour hatefulness . Mary said , " Look ! There it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " " Went right past the tree there and into our yard . " " What was it , Mary ? Tell me ! What did you see ? " In the dusk I saw her smile , that incredible female smile . It is called wisdom but it is n't that but rather an understanding that makes wisdom unnecessary . " You did n't see anything , Mary . " " I saw a quarrel  --  but it got away . " I put my arm about her and turned her . " Let 's go around the block before we go in . " We strolled in the tunnel of the night and we did n't speak again , or need to .  | As A cxILn I hunted and killed small creatures with energy and joy . Rabbits and squirrels , small birds , and later ducks and wild geese came crashing down , rumpled distortions of bone and blood and fur and feathers . There was a savage creativeness about it without hatred or rancor or guilt . The war retired my appetite for destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A shotgun 's blast was no longer a shout of fierce happiness . In this first spring a bouncing pair of rabbits paid daily visits to our garden . They loved best my Mary 's carnations , ate them down to raw crowns . " You 'll have to get rid of them , " Mary said . I brought out my 12-bore , sticky with grease , and found some old thickened shells with number five shot . In the evening I sat on the back steps and when the rabbits were in line I blasted both of them with one shot . Then I buried the furry ruins under the big lilac and I was miserable in the stomach . It was simply that I had grown unused to killing things . A man can get used to anything . Slaughtering or undertaking or even execution ; rack and pincers must be just a job when one gets used to it . ' When the children had gone to bed I said , " I 'm going out for a while . "  | Mary did n't ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ago . " Shall you be late ? " " No , not late . " " I wo n't wait up , I 'm sleepy , " she said . And it seemed that , having accepted a direction , she was farther along than I. I still had the rabbit misery . Perhaps it is natural for a man who has destroyed something to try to restore a balance by creating something . But was that my impulse ? I fumbled my way into the stinking kennel where Danny Taylor lived . A lighted candle burned in a saucer beside his Army cot . Danny was in bad shape , blue and gaunt and sick . His skin had a pewter sheen . It was hard not to be sick at the smell of the dirty place and the dirty man , under a filthy comforter . His eyes were open and glazed . I expected him to babble in delirium . It was a shock when he spoke clearly and in the tone and manner of Danny Taylor . " What do you want here , Eth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know better than that . " " You 're sick . " " Think I do n't know it ? I know it better than anyone . " He groped behind his cot and brought out a bottle of Old Forester one-third full . " Have a shot ? " " No , Danny . That 's expensive whisky . " " I have friends . " " Who gave it to you ? " " That 's none of your business , Eth . " He took a drink and kept it down , but for a moment it was not easy . And then his color came back . He laughed . " My friend wanted to talk business but I fooled him . I passed out before he could get it said . He did n't know how little it takes . Do you want to talk business Eth ? ' Cause I can pass out again quick . " " Do you have any feeling about me , Danny ? Any trust ? Any  --  well , feeling ? "  | " Sure I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a drunk , and a drunk feels strongest about liquor . " " If I could raise the money , would you go for a cure ? " The frightening thing was how quickly he had become normal and easy and  --  like himself . " I might say I would , Eth . But you do n't know drunks . I 'd take the money and drink it up . " " Well , suppose I paid it right to the hospital , or wherever . " " I 'm trying to tell you . I 'd go with the best intentions , and in a few days I 'd get out . You ca n't trust a drunk , Eth . That 's what you ca n't understand . No matter what I did or said  --  I 'd still get out . " " Do n't you want to come out of it , Danny ? " " I guess I do n't . I guess you know what I want . " He hoisted the bottle again , and again I was astonished at the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Danny I knew but his senses and perceptions were sharpened , so clear in fact that he read my thought . " Do n't trust it , " he said . " It 's only for a little time . Alcohol stimulates and then depresses . I hope you wo n't stay around ? o see that . Right now , I do n't believe it will happen . I never do when I 'm up . " Then his eyes , wet and shining in the candlelight , looked into me . " Ethan , " he said . " You offered to pay for a cure for me . You have n't the money , Ethan . " " I could get it . Mary inherited some from her brother . " " And you would give me that ? " " Yes . " " Even though I tell you never to trust a drunk ? Even if I assure you I would take your money and break your heart ? " " You 're breaking my heart now , Danny . I had a dream about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember ? " He raised the bottle and then put it down , saying , " No , not yet  --  not yet . Eth  --  never  --  never trust a drunk . When he ? when I 'm  --  horrible  --  a dead thing  --  there 's still a clever ,  | secret mind at work , and it 's not a friendly mind . Right now , right at this moment , I 'm a man who was your friend . I lied to you about passing out . Oh , I passed out all right , but I know about the bottle . " " Wait , " I said , " before you go any further , else it will look  --  well , you might suspect me . It was Baker brought the bottle , was n't it ? " " Yes . " " Ile wanted you to sign something . " " Yes , but I passed out . " He chuckled to himself and again lifted the bottle to his lips , but in the candlelight I saw the smallest bubble . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things I wanted to tell you , Danny . ' Was it the old place he wanted ? " " Yes . " " How does it happen you have n't sold it ? " " I thought I told you . It makes me a gentleman , lacking only the conduct of a gentleman . " " Do n't sell it , Danny . Hold onto it . " " What 's it to you ? Why not ? " " For your pride . " " I do n't have any pride left , only position . " " Yes , you have . When you asked me for money , you were ashamed . That means pride . " " No , I told you . That was a trick . Drunks are clever , I tell you . It embarrassed you , and you gave me a buck because you thought I was ashamed . I was n't ashamed . I just wanted a drink . " " Do n't sell it , Danny . It 's valuable . Baker knows it . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable about it ? " " It 's the only place nearby level enough for an airfield . " " I see . " " If you 'll hold out , it can be a whole new start for you , Danny . Hold onto it . You could take the cure and when you came out you 'd have a nest egg . "  | " But no nest . Maybe I 'd rather sell it and drink it up and ? When the bough breaks the cradle will fall , and down will come baby , cradle and all . ' " He sang shrilly and laughed . " Do you want the place , Eth ? Is that why you came here ? " " I want you to be well . " " I am well . " " I want to explain , Danny . If you were a bum , you could be free to do whatever you want . But you have something a group of forward-looking citizens want and need . " " Taylor Meadow . And I 'm going to hold onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately at the bottle . " Danny , I told you , it 's the only place for an airport . It 's a key place . They have to have it  --  either that or level the hills , and they ca n't afford that . " " Then I have them by the ying-yang and I 'm going to twist . " " You 've forgotten , Danny . A man of property is a precious vessel . Already I 've heard that the kindest thing would be to put you in an institution where you would get the care you need . " " They would n't dare . " " Oh , yes they would  --  and feel virtuous about it . You know the process . The judge , you know him , would rule you incompetent to handle property . He would appoint a guardian , and I can guess which one . And all this would be expensive , so of course your property would have to be sold to pay the costs , and guess who would be there to buy it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth parted . Now he looked away . " You 're trying to scare me , Eth . You picked the wrong time . Catch me in the morning when I 'm cold and the world is green vomit . Right now  --  my strength it is the strength of ten because the bottle 's here . " He waved it like a sword and his eyes went to slits gleaming in the candle- light . " Did I tell you , Eth ? I think I did  --  a drunk has a special evil kind of intelligence . " " But I 've told you what will happen . " " I agree with you . I know it 's true . You 've made your point . But instead of scaring me , you 're roused my imp . Whoever thinks a drunk is helpless is crazy . A drunk is a very special vehicle with special abilities . I can fight back , and right now I seem to want to . " " Good boy ! That 's what I want to hear . " He sighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it were the bead on the end of a rifle . " You 'd loan me Mary 's money ? " " Yes . " " Without security ? " " Yes . " " Knowing the chance of getting it back is a thousand to one against ? " " Yes . " " There 's an ugly thing in a drunk , Eth . I do n't believe you . " He licked his dry lips . " Would you put the money in my hands ? " " Whenever you say . " " I 've told you not to . " " But I will . " This time he tipped the bottle back and the big bubble rose inside the glass . When he stopped drinking , his eyes were even shinier but they were cold and impersonal as a snake 's eyes . " Can you get the money this week , Eth ? " " Yes . " " Wednesday ? " " Yes . " " Have you got a couple of bucks now ? " I had just that  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimes and a nickel , and three pennies . I poured them into his outstretched hand . He finished the bottle and dropped it on the floor . " Some- how I never put you down for clever , Eth . Do you know even a basic cure would cost about a thousand dollars ? " 11 " All right . " " This is fun , Eth . This is n't chess , it 's poker . I used to be pretty good at poker  --  too good . You 're betting I 'll put up my meadow as collateral . And you 're betting that a thousand dollars ' worth of booze will kill me , and there you 'll be with an airport in your lap . " " That 's a nasty thing , Danny . " " I warned you I was nasty . " " Could n't you think I meant it the way I said it ? " " No . But I 've got a way to  --  keep it the way you said it . You remember me in the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? You 're the kid with the built-in judge . Okay . I 'm getting dry . The bottle 's empty . I 'm going out . My price is one thousand bucks . " " All right . " " In cash on Wednesday . " " I 'll bring it . " " No note , no signature , no nothing . And do n't think you remember me , Ethan , from the old days . My friend here has changed all that . I have no loyalty , no fairness . What you 'll get is nothing but hearty laughter . " " I would only ask you to try . " " Sure , I 'll promise , Eth . But I hope I 've convinced you what a drunk 's promise is worth . Just bring the cash . Stay as long as you like . My house is your house . I 'm going out . See you Wednesday , Eth . " He eased himself up out of the old Army cot , flung the comforter behind it , and walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I sat for a while , watching the candle gutter down into the grease of the saucer . Everything he had said was true , except one thing on which I placed my bet . He had n't changed that much . Somewhere in the wreckage was Danny Taylor . I did n't believe he could amputate Danny . I loved  | Danny and I was prepared to  --  do just what he said . I was . From a distance I heard him singing in a clear , high falsetto : " Speed , bonnie boat , like a bird on the wing . Onward ! ' the sailors cry ! Carry the lad that 's born to be king Over the sea to Skye . " After a lonely while I blew out the candle and walked home by way of High Street . Willie was n't asleep yet in the police car . " Seems to me you 're out a lot , Eth , " he said . " You know how it is . " " Sure . Spring . Young man 's fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slipped in beside her , she half awakened . The misery was in my stomach  --  the cold , hurting misery . Mary turned on her side and gathered me into her warm grass-smelling body and I needed her . I knew the misery would get less , but right now I needed her . I do n't know whether she really awakened but even sleeping she knew my need . And afterward she was awake and she said , " I suppose you 're hungry . " " Yes , Helen . " " What do you want ? " " Onion sandwich  --  no , two onion sandwiches on rye bread . " " I 'll have to have one to stand you . " " Do n't you want one ? " " Of course . " She padded down the stairs and came back in a little while with sandwiches and a carton of milk and two glasses . It was a pretty hot onion . " Mary , muldoon , " I began . " Wait till you swallow . " " Did you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Why  --  yes . " " Well , I have a lead . I want a thousand dollars . " " Was it something Mr. Baker told you ? " " In a way . But private too . " " Well , you just write a check . " " No , darling , I want you to get it in cash . And you might pass the word at the bank that you 're getting new furniture or rugs or something . " " But I 'm not . " " You will . " " Is it a secret ? " " You said you wanted it that way . " " Yes  --  well  --  I do . Yes . It 's better that way . This is a burny onion . Would Mr. Baker approve ? " " He would if he did it . " " When do you want it ? " " Tomorrow . " " I ca n't eat this onion . I guess I smell bad enough now , though . " " You 're my darling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you mean ? " " Coming to the house . Bringing candy . " " God works in a mysterious way . " " Now do n't be sacrilegious . Easter is n't over . " " Yes ' t is . It 's one-fifteen . " " Good Lord ! We better get to sleep . " " Ah ! There 's the rub  --  Shakespeare . " " You 'd make a joke about anything . " But it was no joke . The misery stayed , not thought about but aching away , and sometimes I would have to ask myself , Why do I ache ? Mon can get used to anything , but it takes time . Once long ago I took a job wheeling nitroglycerin in a dynamite plant . The pay was high because the stuff is tricky . At first I worried with every step I took , but in a week or so it was only a job . Why , I 'd even got used to being a grocery  | clerk . There 's something desirable about anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the dark with the red spots swimming in my eyes , I inquired of myself concerning what they used to call matters of conscience , and I could find no wound . I asked whether , having set my course , I could change direction or even reverse the compass ninety degrees and I thought I could but I did n't want to . I had a new dimension , and I was fascinated with it . It was like discovering an unused set of muscles or having come true the child 's dream that I could fly . Often I can replay events , scenes , conversations , and pick up from the repeat details which escaped me at first showing . Mary found strangeness in Marullo 's coming to the house with candy eggs , and I trust Mary 's sense of strangeness . I had thought of it as a thank offering because I had not cheated him . But Mary 's question made me reinspect for something I knew but had passed by . Marullo did not reward for things past ; he bribed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in so far as I could be of use to him . I went back over his business instruction and the talk about Sicily . Somewhere he had lost his certainty . In some way he wanted something of me or needed something . There was a way to find out . If I should ask for something he would ordinarily refuse and get it from him , then I would know that he was off balance and deeply troubled . I put Marullo aside and went to Margie . Margie  --  that gives you an idea of her age . " Margie , I 'm always dreaming of you , Margie . I 'd give the world to . . . " I replayed the Margie scenes against the swimming spots on the ceiling , trying to add no more than was really there . For a long time , maybe two years , there had been a Mrs. Young-Hunt who was a friend of my wife , part of the con. versations I did not listen to . Then suddenly Margie Young Hunt had emerged , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Friday , but I could not remember  | it . On that day it was as though she announced herself . Before that it is possible that she did n't see me any more than I saw her . But from that time on she was present  --  a mover and a shaker . What did she want ? Could it be pure mischief of a woman with too little to do ? Or did she move to a plan ? It did seem to me that she had announced herself to me ? made me conscious of her and kept me aware of her . It seemed to me that she started the second fortune-telling in good faith , intending it to be the usual performance , polished and professional . Then something happened , something that tore it up . Mary had said nothing to cause her tension , nor had I. IIad she really seen the vision of the snake ? That would be the simplest explanation and probably the true one . Maybe she was truly intuitive , an intruder into the minds of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metamorphosis made me likely to believe this , but it could have been an accident . But what made her run to Montauk when she had not intended to go , join up with the drummer , spill the beans to Marullo ? Somehow I did n't believe she spilled things she did n't intend to spill . Somewhere in the attic bookcases there was an account of the life of  --  was it Bering ? No , Baranov , Alexander Baranov , the Russian governor somewhere near i800 . Maybe there would be some reference to Alaska as a prison for witches . It was too unlikely a story to be made up . I must look . I thought maybe I could creep up there now without waking Mary . Then I heard a creak of the old oak stair treads , then a second and a third , so I knew it was not a settling of the house from a change of temperature . It had to be Ellen walking in her sleep . Of course I love my daughter , but sometimes she frightens me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous and loving . She was always jealous of her brother and often I feel she is jealous of me . It seemed to me that her  | preoccupation with sex began very early . Maybe fathers always feel this . When she was a very little girl , her uninhibited interest in male genitalia was embarrassing . Then she went into the secrecy of change . Here was no angelic innocent girlhood of the magazines . The house boiled with nervousness , the walls vibrated with unease . I 've read that in the Middle Ages pubescent girls were thought to be susceptible to witchcraft and I 'm not sure it is not so . For a time we had what we called as a joke a poltergeist . Pictures fell from their hangings , dishes crashed to the floor . There were poundings in the attic and thumpings in the cellar . I do n't know what caused it , but I was interested enough to keep my eye on Ellen , on her secret comings and goings . She was like a night cat . I satisfied myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thumpings , but also I found they never happened when she was out of the house . She might be sitting staring into space when the poltergeist came , but she was always there . As a child I remember hearing that the old Hawley house was haunted long ago by the ghost of one of the puritanpirate ancestors but , according to accounts , he was a decent ghost who walked and wandered and groaned as he should . The stairs creaked under his invisible weight and he rapped on the wall when a death was imminent , all proper and in good taste . The poltergeist was something quite different ? malicious , malignant , and mischievous and vengeful . He never broke a valueless thing . Then he went away . I never really believed in him . He was a family joke , except that there he was and there were the broken pictures and shattered china . When he left , Ellen began walking in her sleep as she was now . I could hear her slow but certain footsteps going downstairs . And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . And a breeze sprang up and moved the shadows of leafing limbs on the ceiling .  | I slipped quietly from bed and slid into my bathrobe , for I , like everyone else , believed that a sleepwalker should not be startled awake . This sounds as though I did n't like my daughter , but I do . I love her , but I am somewhat in fear of her because I do n't understand her . If you use our stairs near the edge on the side of the wall , they do not creak . I discovered that as a tomcatting boy coming home from the back fences of the town . I still use the knowledge if I do not want to disturb Mary . I used it now  --  moved silently down the staircase , trailing my fingers against the wall for guidance . A dim and lacy sublight penetrated from the street-lamp side and dissipated to semidarkness away from the window . But I could see Ellen . She seemed to have a glow , perhaps her white nightgown . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was standing at the glass-fronted cabinet where the worthless family treasures are kept , the carved scrimshaw , the sperm whales and boats complete with oars and irons and crews , harpooner in the bow  --  all carved from whales ' bone  --  like teeth and the curved tusks of walrus ; a small model of the Belle-Adair , shiny with varnish , her furled sails and cordage brown and dusty . There were bits of the chinoiserie the old captains brought from the Orient after they had stripped the China area of sperm whales , bits and pieces , ebony and ivory , laughing and serious gods , Buddhas , serene and dirty , carved flowers in rose quartz and soapstone and some jade  --  yes , some good jade  --  and thin cups , translucent and lovely . Some of the things might be valuable ? like the small shapeless horses which yet had life  --  but if they were valuable it was an accident , must have been . How would those sailing , whale-killing men know good from bad ? or would they ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the parenti to me  --  Roman masks of the ancestors , or the lares and penates back to a stone fallen from the moon . We even had  | a mandrake root  --  a perfect little man , sprouted from the death-ejected sperm of a hanged man , and also we had a veritable mermaid , pretty ratty by now , but cleverly made by sewing the front end of a monkey and the after end of a fish together . It had shrunk with the years and the stitches showed , but its little teeth still showed in a ferocious smile . I presume that every family has a magic thing , a continuity thing that inflames and comforts and inspires from generation to generation . Ours was a  --  how shall I say ? ? a kind of mound of translucent stone , perhaps quartz or jadeite or even soapstone . It was circular , four inches in diameter and an inch and a half at its rounded peak . And carved on its surface was an endless interweaving shape that seemed to move and yet went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tail , nor beginning or end . The polished stone was not slick to the touch but slightly tacky like flesh , and it was always warm to the touch . You could see into it and yet not through it . I guess some old seaman of my blood had brought it back from China . It was magic  --  good to see , to touch , to rub against your cheek or to caress with your fingers . This strange and magic mound lived in the glass cabinet . As child and boy and man I was allowed to touch it , to handle it , but never to carry it away . And its color and convolutions and texture changed as my needs changed . Once I supposed it was a breast , to me as a boy it became yoni , inflamed and aching . Perhaps later it evolved to brain or even enigma , the headless , endless , moving thing  --  the question which is whole within itself , needing no answer to destroy it , no beginning or end to limit it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a square brass key , always in the lock . My sleeping daughter had the magic mound in her hands , caressing it with her fingers , petting it as though it were alive . She pressed it against her unformed breast , placed it on her cheek below her ear , nuzzled it like a suckling puppy , and she hummed a low song like a moan of pleasure and of  | longing . There was destruction in her . I had been afraid at first that she might want to crash it to bits or hide it away , but now I saw that it was mother , lover , child , in her hands . I wondered how I might awaken her without fright . But why are sleepwalkers awakened ? Is it for fear that they may hurt themselves ? I 've never heard of injury in this state , except through awakening . Why should I interfere ? This was no nightmare full of pain or fear but rather pleasure and association beyond waking understanding . What call had I to spoil it ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait . The dim room seemed swarming with particles of brilliant light moving and whirling like clouds of gnats . I guess they were not really there but only prickles of weariness swimming in the fluid of my eyes , but they were very convincing . And it did seem true that a glow came from my daughter Ellen , not only from the white of her gown but from her skin as well . I could see her face and I should not have been able to in the darkened room . It seemed to me that it was not a little girl 's face at all  --  nor was it old , but it was mature and complete and formed . Her lips closed firmly , which they did not normally do . After a time Ellen put the talisman firmly and precisely back in its place and she closed the glass-fronted case and twisted the brass key that kept it closed . Then she turned and walked past my chair and up the stairs . Two things I may have imagined  --  one , that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and second , that as she went the luminescence drained away from her . These may be impressions , children of my mind , but a third thing is not . As she ascended the stairs , there was no creak of wood . She must have been walking near to the wall , where the treads do not complain . In a few moments I followed her and found her in her bed , asleep and properly covered . She breathed through her mouth and her face was a sleeping child 's face .  | On compulsion I went down the stairs again and opened the glass case . I took the mound in my hands . It was warm from Ellen 's body . As I had done in childhood , I traced the cndlcss flowing form with my forefingertip and I took comfort in it . I felt close to Ellen because of it . I wonder , did the stone bring her somehow close to me ? to the Hawleys ?  | ON MONDAY perfidious spring dodged back toward winter with cold rain and raw gusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . The bold and concupiscent bull sparrows on the lawns , intent on lechery , got blown about like rags , off course and off target , and they chattered wrathfully against the inconstant weather . ji I greeted Mr. Red Baker on his tour , his tail blown sideways like a battle flag . He was an old acquaintance , squinting his eyes against the rain . I said , " From now on you and I can be friends on the surface , but I feel it only right to tell + you that our smiles conceal a savage contest , a conflict of interests . " I could have said more but he was anxious to finish his chores and get under cover . The Morph was on time . He may have been waiting for me  --  probably was . " Hell of a day , " he said , and his oiledsilk raincoat flapped and billowed around his legs . " I hear 1111 you did a social turn with my boss . " " I needed some advice . He gave me tea too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how advice is . You only want it if it agrees with what you wanted to do anyway . " " Sounds like investment . " " My Mary wants some new furniture . When a woman  | wants something she first dresses it up as a good investment. , ' " Not only women , either , " said Morph . " I do it myself . " " Well , it 's her money . She wants to shop around for bargains . " At the corner of High Street we watched a tin sign tear loose from Rapp 's Toy Store and go skidding and screeching along , sounding like a traffic accident . " Say , I heard your boss is going to make a trip home to Italy . " " I do n't know . Seems odd to me he never went before . ' Those families are awful close . " " Got time for a cup of coffee ? " " I ought to get swept out . Should be a busy morning after the holiday . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baker can afford time for a cup of coffee . " He did n't say it meanly the way it looks in print . He could make anything sound innocent and well-intentioned . In all the years I had never gone into the Foremaster Grill for a cup of coffee in the morning and I was probably the only man in town who did n't . It was a custom , a habit , and a club . We climbed on stools at the counter and Miss Lynch , I went to school with her , slid coffee to us without spilling any in the saucer . A tiny bottle of cream leaned against the cup but she rolled two paper-wrapped cubes of sugar like dice so that Morph cried out , " Snake eyes . " Miss Lynch  --  Miss Lynch . The " miss ' was part of her name by now , and part of herself . I guess she will never be able to excise it . Her nose gets redder every year , but it 's sinus , not booze . " Morning , Ethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He dragged me in , " I said , and then as an experiment in kindness , " Annie . "  | 1 Her head snapped around as though at a pistol shot and then , as the idea got through , she smiled and , do you know , she looked exactly as she had in the fifth grade , red nose and all . " It 's good to see you , Ethan , " she said and wiped her nose on a paper napkin . " When I heard it , I was surprised , " Morph said . He picked at the paper on the sugar cube . His nails were polished . " You get an idea and then it 's fixed and you think it 's true . Gives you a turn when it 's not . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I guess I do n't either . Goddam these wrappers . ' Why ca n't they just put it loose in a bowl ? " " Maybe because people might use more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once lived . on sugar for a while . He 'd go in the Automat . Ten cents for a cup of coffee , drink half , fill it up with sugar . At least be did n't starve to death . " As usual , I wondered if that guy was n't Morph  --  a strange one , tough , ageless man with a manicure . I think he was a fairly well-educated man , but only because of his processes , his technique of thinking . His erudition hid in a demi-world dialect , a language of the bright , hard , brassy illiterate . " Is that why you use one lump of sugar ? " I asked . He grinned . " Everybody 's got a theory , " he said . " I do n't care how beat a guy is , he 'll have a theory why he 's beat . A theory can lead you down the garden path ' cause you 'll follow it in spite of road signs . I guess that 's what fooled me about your boss . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . It was n't very good . It did n't taste like coffee at all but it was hot , and I spilled sonic on my shirt , so I know it was also brown . " I guess I do n't know what you mean . " " I been trying to track where I got the idea . I guess it 's because he says he 's been here forty years . Thirty-five years or thirty-seven years , okay , but not forty years . "  | " I guess I 'm not too bright . " " ' That would make it 1920 . You still do n't dig it ? Well , in a bank you 've got to case people quick , check hustlers , you know . Pretty soon you get a built-in set of rules . You do n't even think about it . It just clicks into place  --  and you ran be wrong . Maybe he did come in 1920 . I could be wrong . I finished my coffee . " Time to sweep out , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you asked questions I 'd be hard to get . But you do n't , so I got to tell you . Nineteen twenty-one was the first emergency immigration law . " " And ? " " In 1920 he could come in . In 1921 he probably could n't . " " And ? " " So  --  anyway my weasel brain says  --  he came in after 1921 by the back door . So he ca n't go home because he ca n't get a passport to get back . " " God , I 'm glad I 'm not a banker . " " You 'd probably be better than I am . I talk too much . If he 's going back , I 'm real wrong . Wait up  --  I 'm coming . Coffee 's on me . " " ' By , Annie , " I said . " Come in again , Eth . You never come in . " " I will . " As we crossed the street Morph said , " Do n't let on to his guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait , will you ? " " Why should I ? " " Why did I ? What 's in that jewel case ? " " Knight Templar 's hat . Feather 's yellow . Going to see if it can be whited up . " " You belong to that ? " " It 's in the family . We been Masons since before George Washington was Grand Master . " " He was ? Does Mr. Baker belong ? "  | " It 's in his family too . " We were in the alley now . Morph fished for the key to the bank 's back door . " Maybe that 's why we open the safe like a lodge meeting . Might as well be holding candles . It 's kind of holy . " " Morph , " I said . " you 're full of bull this morning . Easter did n't clean you up at all . " " I 'll know in eight days , " he said . " No , I mean it . Comes nine o'clock on the nose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the time lock springs and Father Baker genuflects and opens the safe and we all bow down to the Great God Currency . " " You 're nuts , Morph . " " Maybe so . Goddam this old lock . You could open it with an ice pick but not with the key . " He jiggled the key and kicked at the door until it finally burst open . He took a piece of Kleenex from his pocket and jammed it into the spring lock 's seat . I caught myself about to ask , Is n't that dangerous ? He answered without the question . " Damn thing wo n't lock itself open . Course Baker checks to see it 's locked after the safe 's open . Do n't blow my dirty suspicions to Marullo , will you ? He 's too solvent . " " Okay , Morph , " I said and turned to my own door on my own side of the alley , and looked around for the cat that always tried to get in , but he was n't there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw things I had never seen before and did n't see things that had worried and irritated me . And why not ? Bring new eyes to a world or even new lenses , and presto  --  new world . The leaky valve of the old box toilet hissed softly . Marullo would n't get a new valve because the water was n't metered and who cared . I went to the front of the store and lifted a slotted two-pound weight from the old-fashioned balance scale . In the toilet I hung the weight on the chain above the oaken tassel . The toilet flushed and kept on flush- ing . I went back to the front of the store to listen and could hear it bubbling and scolding in the bowl . It 's a sound you ca n't mistake for anything else . Then I returned the weight to its bar on the scale and took my place in my pulpit behind the counter . My congregation in the shelves stood waiting . Poor devils , they could n't get away . I particularly noticed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pew of breakfast foods . That reminded me of my promise to Allen . I found the extension hand for grabbing things from top shelves and took a box down and stood it tinder my coat in the storeroom . ' When I was back in the pulpit , the next Mickey Mouse in line smiled down at me . I reached behind the canned goods and brought out the gray linen sack of small change for the cash register , then , remembering something , reached farther until my hand found the old greasy .38-caliber revolver that had been there ever since I can remember . It was a silvered Iver Johnson with most of the silver peeled off . I broke it and saw the cartridges green with verdigris . The cylinder was so sluggish with ancient grease that it turned with difficulty . I put the disreputable and probably dangerous piece in the drawer below the cash register , pulled out a clean apron , and wrapped it around my middle , folding the top over neatly to conceal the strings . Is there anyone who has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty of the earth ? Are they born in reasoning and dictated by virtue or can some of them be the products of accidents , of daydreaming , of imagining , of the stories we tell ourselves ? I know exactly how long I had been playing a game of imagining because I know it started with the Morph 's rules for successful bank robbery . I had gone over his words with a childish pleasure Adults ordinarily will not admit . It was a play game that ran parallel with the store 's life and everything that happened seemed to fall into place in the game . The leaking toilet , the Mickey Mouse mask Allen wanted , the account of the open- ing of the safe . New curves and angles dropped into place , the Kleenex nudged in the door lock in the alley . Little by little the game grew , but entirely in the mind until this morning . Putting the scale weight on the toilet chain was the first physical contribution I had made to the mental ballet . Getting the old pistol out was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timing . The game was growing in precision . I still carry my father 's big silver Hamilton railroad watch with thick hands and big black numbers , a wonderful watch for time-telling , if not for beauty . This morning I put it in my shirt pocket before I swept out the store . And I checked the time so that at five minutes to nine I had the front doors open and had just taken the first deliberate broom strokes at the sidewalk . It 's amazing how much dirt accumulates over a weekend , and what with the rain , the dirt was slush . What a wonderful precision instrument is our bank  --  like my father 's railroad watch . At five minutes of nine Mr. Baker came into the wind from Elm Street . Harry Robbit and Edith Alden must have been watching . They backed out of the Foremaster Grill and joined him midstreet . " Morning , Mr. Baker , " I called . " Morning , Edith . Morning , Harry . " " Good morning , Ethan . You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank . I leaned my broom in the store entrance , took the weight from the scale , went behind the cash register , opened the drawer , and went through fast but deliberate pantomime . I walked to the storeroom , hung the weight on the toilet chain . Hooked the skirt of my apron over the belly band , put on my raincoat , and stepped to the back door and opened it a crack . As the black minute hand of my watch crossed twelve the clock bell of the firehouse began bonging . I counted eight steps across the alley and then in my mind twenty steps . I moved my hand but not my lips  --  allowed ten seconds , moved my hand again . All this I saw in my  | mind  --  I counted while my hands made certain movements - twenty steps , quick but deliberate , then eight more steps . I closed the alley door , took off my raincoat , unhooked my apron , went into the toilet , took the weight off the chain and stopped the flushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened my hatbox and closed and strapped it , went back to the entrance , took up my broom , and looked at the watch . It was two minutes and twenty seconds past ' nine o'clock ; pretty good , but with a little practice it could be cut under two minutes . I was only half finished with the sidewalk when Stoney , the chief constable , came across from the Foremaster Grill . " Morning , Eth . Gim me a quick half-pound of butter , pound of bacon , bottle of milk , and a dozen eggs . My wife run out of everything . " " Sure thing , Chief . How 's everything ? " I got the things together and snapped open a bag . " Okay , " he said . " I come by a minute ago but I heard you was in the can . " " It 'll take me a week to get over all those hard-boiled eggs " " That 's the truth , " said Stoney . " Man 's got to go , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he was about to leave , he said , " What 's with your friend , Danny Taylor ? " " I do n't know  --  is he on one ? " " No , he looked pretty good , fairly clean . I was sitting in the car . He had me witness his signature . " " For what ? " " I do n't know . Had two papers but turned back so I could n't see . " " Two papers ? " " Yeah , two . He signed twice and I witnessed twice . " " Was he sober ? " " Seemed like . Had his hair cut and a necktie on . "  | " I wish I could believe it , Chief . " " So do I. Poor fella . I guess they never stop trying . I got to get home . " And he galloped away . Stoney 's wife is twenty years younger than he is . I went back and brushed the larger pieces of filth off the sidewalk . I felt lousy . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the heavy custom . It seemed to me that everybody in town had run out of everything . And since our deliveries of fruits and vegetables did n't come in until about noon , the pickings were pretty slim . But even with what we had , the customers kept me jumping . Marullo came in about ten o'clock and for a wonder he gave me a hand , weighing and wrapping and ringing up money on the cash register . He had n't helped around the store for a long time . Mostly he just wandered in and looked around and went out  --  like an absentee landlord . But this morning he helped to open the crates and boxes of fresh stuff when it came in . It seemed to me that he was uneasy and that he studied me when I was n't looking . We did n't have time to talk but I could feel his eyes on me . I thought it must be hearing that I had refused the bribe . Maybe Morph was right . A certain kind of man , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prompted it . The **27;478;TOOLONG ? attitude must be particularly strong in men who play their own lives like a poker hand . The thought gave me a little chuckle but a deep one that did n't even raise a bubble to the surface . About eleven o'clock , my Mary came in , shining in a new cotton print . She looked pretty and happy and a little breathless , as though she had clone a pleasant but dangerous thing  --  and she had . She gave me a brown manila envelope . " I thought you might be wanting this , " she said . She smiled at Marullo the bright birdlike way she does when she does n't really like someone . And she did n't like or trust Marullo  --  never had . I always put it down to the fact that a wife never likes her husband 's boss or his secretary .  | I said , " Thank you , dear . You 're very thoughtful . Sorry I ca n't take you for a boat ride on the Nile right now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , did n't you run out of everything ? " " Sure I did . Here , I 've got a list . Will you bring things home tonight ? I know you 're too rushed to put them up now . " " But no hard-boiled eggs ? " " No , darling . Not for a whole year . " " Those Easter bunnies were sure busy . " " Margie wants to take us to dinner at the Foremaster tonight . She says she never gets to entertain us . " " Fine , " I said . " She says her place is too small . " " Is it ? " " I 'm keeping you from your work , " she said . Marullo 's eyes were on the brown envelope in my hand . I put it up under my apron and stuffed it in my pocket . He knew it was a bank envelope . And I could feel his mind hunting like a terrier after rats in a city dump . Mary said , " I did n't get a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children loved it . " " Just good wishes of the Easter , " he said . " You dress like springtime . " " Why , thank you . I got wet too . I thought the rain was over , but it came back . " " Take my raincoat , Mary . " " I would n't think of it . It 's just a shower now . You get back to your customers . " The pace got worse . Mr. Baker looked in and saw the line of people waiting and went out . " I 'll come back later , " he called . And still they came , right up until noon , and then , as usually happens , all custom stopped . People were eating lunch . The traffic died out in the street . For the first time all morning no one was wanting something . I drank more  | milk from the carton I had opened . Anything I took from the store I marked down and just deducted it from my pay . Marullo let me have things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think we could have lived on my pay if he had n't . He leaned back against the counter and folded his arms and that hurt , so he shoved his hands in his pockets until that hurt . I said , " I 'm sure glad you helped out . Never saw such a rush . But I guess they ca n't go on living on left-over potato salad . " " You do a nice job , kid . " " I do a job . " " No , they come back . They like you . " " They 're just used to me . I 've been here forever . " And then I tried a little tiny probe . " I 'll bet you 're looking forward to that hot Sicilian sun . It is hot in Sicily . I was there in the war . " Marullo looked away . " I do n't make my mind yet . " " Why not ? " " Well , I been away so long time  --  forty years . I do n't know nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't know me neither . " " I sure wish I could take a vacation in Italy  --  without a rifle and a field pack . Forty years is a long time , though . What year did you come over ? " " Nineteen twenty  --  long time ago . " Morph seemed to have hit it on the nose . Maybe bankers and cops and customs men get an instinct . Then another , maybe a little deeper probe came to my mind . I opened the drawer and took out the old revolver and tossed it on the counter . Marullo put his hands behind him . " What you got there , kid ? " " I just thought you ought to get a permit for it if you have n't got one . The Sullivan Act is a tough one . "  | " Where 'd it come from ? " " It 's been here all along . " " I never saw it . It do n't belong to me . It 's yours . " " Not mine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to somebody . Long as it 's here do n't you think you better apply for a permit ? You sure it 's not yours ? " " I tell you I never saw it . I do n't like guns . " " That 's funny . I thought all big Mafia men loved em . " How you mean , Mafia ? You trying to say I 'm Mafia ? " I made a big innocent joke about it . " The way I heard it , all Sicilians belong to Mafia . " " That 's crazy . I do n't even know no Mafia . " I tossed the gun into the drawer . " Live and learn ! " I said . " Well , I sure do n't want it . Maybe I better turn it over to Stoney . Tell him I just came on it behind something , because that 's what I did . " " You do that , " said Marullo . " I never saw it in my life . I do n't want it . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Out it goes . " It takes quite a few documents to get a Sullivan Act permit  --  almost as many as to get a passport . My boss had ants . Maybe too many small things had happened too close together . The elderly Miss Elgar , the princess royal of New Baytown , came in close-hauled , with a set jib . Between Miss Elgar and the world were two plates of safety glass , a space between . She negotiated for a dozen eggs . Having known me as a little boy , she never thought of me as anything else . I could see that she was amazed and pleased that I could make change . " I thank you , Ethan , " she said . Her eyes slid over the coffee-grinder and over Marullo and gave equal attention to each . " How 's your father , Ethan ? " " Fine , Miss Elgar , " I said . " Give him my greetings , that 's a good boy . "  | " Yes , ma'am . I surely will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time sense . They say she still winds the grandfather clock every Sunday night and it has been electrified for years . It would n't be bad to be that way , suspended in time  --  not bad at all , an endless afternoon of now . She nodded gravely to the coffee-grinder before she left . " Crazy in the head , " Marullo said and screwed his forefinger into his temple . " Nobody changes . Nobody gets hurt . " " Your father is dead . Why do n't you tell her he 's dead ? " " If she 'd believed me , she 'd forget it . She always asks after him . It 's not so long ago she stopped inquiring after my grandfather . She was his friend , they say , the old goat . " " Crazy in the head , " Marullo observed . But for some reason having to do with Miss Elgar 's unusual feeling about time , he had got hold of himself . It 's hard to know how simple or complicated a man is . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . I think , from habit and practice , Marullo had reduced his approaches to men to three : command , flattery , and purchase . And the three must have worked often enough to allow him to depend on them . Somewhere in his dealing with me he had lost the first . " You 're a good kid , " he said . " You 're a good friend too . " " Old Cap'n , he was my grandfather , used to say , If you want to keep a friend never test him . ' " " That 's smart . " " He was smart . " " All over Sunday I been thinking , kid  --  even in church I was thinking . " I knew he had been worried about the kickback , at least I thought he had , so I jumped it out to save him time . " About that fine present , huh ? " " Yeah . " He looked at me with admiration . " You 're smart too . " " Not smart enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long  --  twelve years ? "  | " That 's it  --  too long . ' Bout time for a change , do n't you think ? " " And you never took none of the petty cash and you never took nothing home without you wrote it down . " " Honesty is a racket with me . " " Do n't make no joke . What I say is true . I check . I know . " " You may pin the medal on my left lapel . " " Everybody steals  --  some more , some less  --  but not you . I know ! " " Maybe I 'm waiting to steal the whole thing . " " Do n't make jokes . What I say is true . " " Alfio , you 've got a jewel . Do n't polish me too much . The paste may show through . " " Why do n't you be partners with me ? " " On what ? My salary ? " " We work it out some way . " " Then I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciatively . " You 're smart , kid . But you do n't steal . " " You did n't listen . Maybe I plan to take it all . " " You 're honest , kid . " " That 's what I 'm telling you . When I 'm most honest , nobody believes me . I tell you , Alfio , to conceal your motives , tell the truth . " " What kind of talk you do ? " " Ars est celare artem . " He moved his lips over that and then broke into a laugh . " Ho , " he cried . " Ho ! Ho ! Hic erat demonstrandum . " " Want a cold Coke ? " " No good for here ! " He flung his arms across his abdomen . " You are n't old enough for a bad stomach , not over fifty . " " Fifty-two , and I got a bad stomach . " " Okay , " I said . " Then you came over at twelve if it was 1920 . I guess they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was choirboy , " he said . " I used to carry the cross in the choir myself . I 'm going to have a Coke . Alfio , " I said , " you work out a way for me to buy in here and I 'll look at it . But I warn you , I do n't have money . " " We work it out . " " But I 'm going to have money . " His eyes were on my face and could n't seem to remove themselves . And Marullo said softly , " Io lo credo . " Power but not of glory surged through me . I opened a Coke and , tipping it back , looked down its brown barrel at Marullo 's eyes . " You 're a good kid , " he said and he shook my hand and wandered away , out of the store . On an impulse I called after him , " How does your arm feel ? " He turned with a look of astonishment . " It do n't hurt no more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words to himself , " It do n't hurt no more . " He came back excitedly . " You got to take that dough . " " What dough ? " " That five per cent . " " Why ? " " You got to take it . You can buy in with me a little and a little , only hold out for six per cent . " " No . " " What you mean no , if I say yes ? " " I wo n't need it , Alfio . I 'd taken it if I needed to , but I do n't need it . " He sighed deeply . The afternoon was n't as busy as the morning , but it was n't light either . There 's always a slack time between three and four  --  usually twenty minutes to half an hour , I do n't know why . Then it picks up again , but that 's people going home from work and wives whomping up a last-ditch dinner .  | In the slack period Mr. Baker came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold chamber , until the store was clear of two customers , both sloppy shoppers , the kind who do n't know what they want , the kind who pick up and put down , hoping that something will jump into their arms and demand to be bought . At last the shoppers were finished and gone . " Ethan , " he said , " did you know Mary drew out a thousand dollars ? " " Yes , sir . She told me she was going to . " " Do you know what she wants it for ? " " Sure , sir . She 's been talking about it for months . You know how women are . The furniture gets a little worn , but just the minute they decide to get new , the old stuff is just impossible . " " Do n't you think it 's foolish to spend it now on that kind of stuff ? I told you yesterday there was going to be an opening . " " It 's her money , sir . " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sure-fire investment . I believe with that thousand she could get her furniture in a year and still have a thousand . " " Mr. Baker , I ca n't very well forbid her to spend her own money . " " Could n't you persuade her , could n't you reason with her ? " " It never occurred to me . " " That sounds like your father , Ethan . That sounds wishywashy . If I 'm going to help you get on your feet I ca n't have you wishy-washy . " " Well , sir . " " And it is n't like she was going to spend it locally . No , she 's going to wander around the discount houses and pay cash . There 's no telling what she 'll pick up . Local man might charge more but he 'd be here if she got a lemon . You should put your foot down , Ethan . Try to get her to rede- posit it ! Or you tell her to put the money in my hands . She 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her , sir . " " I know that . I tried to reason with her when she drew it . She just turned blue-eyed vague  --  said she wanted to look around . Ca n't she look around without a thousand dollars in her pocket ? You ought to know better , if she does n't . " " I guess I 'm out of practice , Mr. Baker . We have n't had any money since we were married . " " Well , ell , you 'd better learn and learn quick or you wo n't have any very long . The spending habit is like a dope with some women . " " Mary has n't had a chance to develop the habit , sir . " " Well , she will . Just let her taste blood and she 'll turn killer . " " Mr. Baker , I do n't think you mean that . " " I do too . " " There 's never been a more careful wife with money . She 's had to be . " For some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I 'm disappointed in , Ethan . If you 're going to get any place you 've got to be the boss in your own house . You could hold off new furniture another little while . " " I could , but she ca n't . " The thought came to me that I maybe bankers develop X-ray eyes for money , that maybe he could see the envelope through my clothes . Ill try to reason with her , Mr. Baker . " " If she has n't spent it already . Is she home now ? " " She said she was going to get a bus to Ridgehampton . " " Good God ! There goes a thousand bucks . " " Well , she still has some capital . " " That 's not the point . Your only entrance is money . " " Money gets money , " I said softly . " That 's right . Lose sight of that and you 're a gone goose , a clerk for the rest of your life . "  | " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the law . " " Women are funny , sir . Maybe your talking about making money yesterday gave her the idea it was easy to get . " " Well , you disabuse her , because without it you ca n't get any . " Would you like a cold Coke , sir ? " " Yes , I would . " He could n't drink it out of the bottle . I had to open a package of paper picnic cups , but it cooled him a little . He muttered like retreating thunder . Two Negro ladies from the crossing came in and he had to swallow his Coke and his rage . " You talk to her , " he said savagely and he strode out and crossed the street to go home . I wondered if he was mad because he was suspicious , but I did n't think so . No , I think he was mad because he felt he 'd lost his habit of command . You can get furious at someone who does n't take your advice . The Negro ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crossing , very nice people . They do n't trade with us much because they have their own store , only now and then they do some comparative shopping to see if their racial loyalty is n't costing them too much . They did more pricing than buying and I understand why  --  pretty women , too , such long , straight , slender legs . It 's a wonder what a lack of malnutrition in childhood can do for the human body , or the human spirit , for that matter . Just before closing time I telephoned Mary . " Pigeonflake , I 'm going to be a little late . " " Do n't forget we 're having dinner with Margie at the Foremaster . " " I remember . " " How late are you going to be ? " " Ten or fifteen minutes . I want to walk down and look at the dredger in the harbor . " " Why ? "
