After an elderly woman was mugged in an alley in San Pedro , Calif. , a witness saw a blonde girl with a ponytail run from the alley and jump into a yellow car driven by a bearded Negro . Eventually tried for the crime , Janet and Malcolm Collins were faced with the circumstantial evidence that she was white , blonde and wore a ponytail while her Negro husband owned a yellow car and wore a beard . The prosecution , impressed by the unusual nature and number of matching details , sought to persuade the jury by invoking a law rarely used in a courtroom-the mathematical law of statistical probability . <P> The jury was indeed persuaded , and ultimately convicted the Collinses ( TIME , Jan. 8 , 1965 ) . Small wonder . With the help of an expert witness from the mathematics department of a nearby college , the prosecutor explained that the probability of a set of events actually occurring is determined by multiplying together the probabilities of each of the events . Using what he considered " conservative " estimates ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being yellow were 1 in 10 , the chances of a couple in a car being interracial 1 in 1,000 ) , the prosecutor multiplied all the factors together and concluded that the odds were 1 in 12 million that any other couple shared the characteristics of the defendants . <P> Only One Couple . The logic of it all seemed overwhelming , and few disciplines pay as much homage to logic as do the law and math . But neither works right with the wrong premises . Hearing an appeal of Malcolm Collins ' conviction , the California Supreme Court recently turned up some serious defects , including the fact that not even the odds were all they seemed . <P> To begin with , the prosecution failed to supply evidence that " any of the individual probability factors listed were even roughly accurate . " Moreover , the factors were not shown to be fully independent of one another as they must be to satisfy the mathematical law ; the factor of a Negro with a beard , for instance , overlaps the possibility that the bearded Negro may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 figure , therefore , was just " wild conjecture . " In addition , there was not complete agreement among the witnesses about the characteristics in question . " No mathematical equation , " added the court , " can prove beyond a reasonable doubt ( 1 ) that the guilty couple in fact possessed the characteristics described by the witnesses , or even ( 2 ) that only one couple possessing those distinctive characteristics could be found in the entire Los Angeles area . " <P> Improbable Probability . To explain why , Judge Raymond Sullivan attached a four-page appendix to his opinion that carried the necessary math far beyond the relatively simple formula of probability . Judge Sullivan was willing to assume it was unlikely that such a couple as the one described existed . But since such a couple did exist-and the Collinses demonstrably did exist-there was a perfectly acceptable mathematical formula for determining the probability that another such couple existed . Using the formula and the prosecution 's figure of 12 million , the judge demonstrated to his own satisfaction and that of five concurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other couple in the area might satisfy the requirements. *
