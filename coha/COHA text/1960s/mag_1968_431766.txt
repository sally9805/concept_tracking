 | HOW COULD VIETNAM HAPPEN ? An Autopsy @# As A case study in the making of foreign policy , the Vietnam War will fascinate historians and social scientists for many decades to come . One question that will certainly be asked : How did men of superior ability , sound training , and high ideals ? American policy-makers of the 1960s ? create such costly and divisive policy ? As one who watched the decision-making process in Washington from 1961 to 1966 under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson , . I can suggest a preliminary answer . I can do so by briefly listing some of the factors that seemed to me to shape our Vietnam policy during my years as an East Asia specialist at the State Department and the White House . I shall deal largely with Washington as I saw or sensed it , and not with Saigon , where I have spent but a scant three days , in the entourage of the Vice President , or with other decision centers , the capitals of interested parties . Nor will I deal with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1961 , for instance , or the overall course of America 's relations with Vietnam . Yet a first and central ingredient in these years of Vietnam decisions does involve history . The ingredient was the legacy of the 7950s ? by which I mean the so-called " loss of China , " the Korean War , and the Far East policy of Secretary of State Dulles . This legacy had an institutional by-product for the Kennedy Administration : in 1961 the U.S. government 's East Asian establishment was undoubtedly the most rigid and doctrinaire of Washington 's regional divisions in foreign affairs . This was especially true at the Department of State , where the incoming Administration found the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs the hardest nut to crack . It was a bureau that had been purged of its best China expertise , and of farsighted , dispassionate men , as a result of McCarthyism . Its members were generally committed to one policy line : the close containment and isolation of mainland China , the harassment of " neutralist " nations which sought to avoid alignment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of alliances with anti-Communist client states on China 's periphery . Another aspect of the legacy was the special vulnerability and sensitivity of the new Democratic Administration on Far East policy issues . The memory of the McCarthy era was still very sharp , and Kennedy 's margin of victory was too thin . The 1960 Offshore Islands TV debate between Kennedy  | and Nixon had shown the President-elect the perils of " fresh thinking . " The Administration was inherently leery of moving too fast on Asia . As a result , the Far East Bureau ( now the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs ) was the last one to be overhauled . Not until Averell Harriman was brought in as Assistant Secretary in December , 1961 , were significant personnel changes attempted , and it took Harriman several months to make a deep imprint on the bureau because of his necessary preoccupation with the Laos settlement . Once he did so , there was virtually no effort to bring back the purged or exiled East Asia experts . There were other important by-products of this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somewhat shared a general perception of China-on-the-march ? a sense of China 's vastness , its numbers , its belligerence ; a revived sense , perhaps , of the Golden Horde . This was a perception fed by Chinese intervention in the Korean War ( an intervention actually based on appallingly bad communications and mutual miscalculation on the part of Washington and Peking ; but the careful unraveling of that tragedy , which scholars have accomplished , had not yet become part of the conventional wisdom ) . The new Administration inherited and briefly accepted a monolithic conception of the Communist bloc . Despite much earlier predictions and reports by outside analysts , policy-makers did not begin to accept the reality and possible finality of the SinoSoviet split until the first weeks of 1962 . The inevitably corrosive impact of competing nationalisms on Communism was largely ignored . The new Administration inherited and to some extent shared the " domino theory " about Asia . This theory resulted from profound ignorance of Asian history and hence ignorance of the radical differences among Asian nations and societies . It resulted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( It may also have resulted from a subconscious sense that , since " all Asians look alike , " all Asian nations will act alike . ) As a theory , the domino fallacy was not merely inaccurate but also insulting to Asian nations ; yet it has continued to this day to beguile men who should know better . Finally , the legacy of the fifties was apparently compounded by an uneasy sense of a worldwide Communist challenge to the new Administration after the Bay of Pigs fiasco . A first manifestation was the President 's traumatic Vienna meeting with Khrushchev in June , 1961 ; then came the Berlin crisis of the summer . All this created an atmosphere in which President Kennedy undoubtedly felt under special pressure to show his nation 's mettle in Vietnam ? if the Vietnamese , unlike the people of Laos , were willing to fight . In general , the legacy of the fifties shaped such early moves of the new Administration as the decisions to maintain a high-visibility SEATO ( by sending the Secretary of State himself instead of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back away from diplomatic recognition of Mongolia in the summer of 1961 , and most important , to expand U.S. military assistance to South Vietnam that winter on the basis of the much more tentative Eisenhower commitment . It should be added that the increased commitment to Vietnam was also fueled by a new breed of military strategists and academic social scientists ( some of whom had entered the new Administration ) who had developed theories of counterguerrilla warfare and were eager to see them put to the test . To some , " counterinsurgency " seemed a new panacea for coping with the world 's instability . So MucH for the legacy and the history . Any new Administration inherits both complicated problems and simplistic views of the world . But surely among the policy-makers of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations there were men who would warn of the dangers of an open-ended commitment to the Vietnam quagmire ? This raises a central question , at the heart of the policy process : Where were the experts , the doubters , and the dissenters ? Were they there at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer is complex but instructive . In the first place , the American government was sorely lacking in real Vietnam or Indochina expertise . Originally treated as an adjunct of Embassy Paris , our Saigon embassy and the Vietnam Desk at State were largely staffed from 1954 onward by French-speaking Foreign Service personnel of narrowly European experience . Such diplomats were even more closely restricted than the normal embassy officer ? by cast of mind as well as language ? to contacts with Vietnam 's French-speaking urban elites . For instance , Foreign Service linguists in Portugal are able to speak with the peasantry if they get out of Lisbon and choose to do so ; not so the French speakers of Embassy Saigon . In addition , the shadow of the " loss of China " distorted Vietnam reporting . Career officers in the Department , and especially those in the field , had not forgotten the fate of their World War II colleagues who wrote in frankness from China and were later pilloried by Senate committees for critical comments on the Chinese Nationalists . Candid reporting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diem government was inhibited by the memory . It was also inhibited by  | some higher officials , notably Ambassador Nolting in Saigon , who refused to sign off on such cables . In due course , to be sure , some Vietnam talent was discovered or developed . But a recurrent and increasingly important factor in the decisionmaking process was the banishment of real expertise . Here the underlying cause was the " closed politics " of policy-making as issues become hot : the more sensitive the issue , and the higher it rises in the bureaucracy , the more completely the experts are excluded while the harassed senior generalists take over ( that is , the Secretaries , Undersecretaries , and Presidential Assistants ) . The frantic skimming of briefing papers in the back seats of limousines is no substitute for the presence of specialists ; furthermore , in times of crisis such papers are deemed " too sensitive " even for review by the specialists . Another underlying cause of this banishment , as Vietnam became more critical , was the replacement of the experts , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can-do guys , " loyal and energetic fixers unsoured by expertise . In early 1965 , when I confided my growing policy doubts to an older colleague on the NSC staff , he assured me that the smartest thing both of us could do was to " steer clear of the whole Vietnam mess " ; the gentleman in question had the misfortune to be a " can-do guy , " however , and is now highly placed in Vietnam , under orders to solve the mess . Despite the banishment of the experts , internal doubters and dissenters did indeed appear and persist . Yet as I watched the process , such men were effectively neutralized by a subtle dynamic : the domestication of dissenters . Such " domestication " arose out of a twofold clubbish need : on the one hand , the dissenter 's desire to stay aboard ; and on the other hand , the nondissenter 's conscience . Simply stated , dissent , when recognized , was made to feel at home . On the lowest possible scale of importance , I must confess my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my senior White House employer would refer to me as his " favorite dove . " Far more significant was the case of the former Undersecretary of State , George Ball . Once Mr. Ball began to express doubts , he was warmly institutionalized : he was encouraged to become the inhouse devil 's advocate on Vietnam . The upshot was inevitable : the process of escalation allowed for periodic requests to Mr. Ball to speak his piece ; Ball felt good , I assume ( he had fought for righteousness ) ; the others felt good ( they had given a full hearing to the dovish option ) ; and there was minimal unpleasantness . The club remained intact ; and it is of course possible that matters would have gotten worse faster if Mr. Ball had kept silent , or left before his final departure in the fall of 1966 . There was also , of course , the case of the last institutionalized doubter , Bill Moyers . The President is said to have greeted his arrival at meetings with an affectionate ; " Well , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamics of domesticated dissent sustained the relationship for a while . A related point ? and crucial , I suppose , to government at all times ? was the " effectiveness " trap , the trap that keeps men from speaking out , as clearly or often as they might , within the government . And it is the trap that keeps men from resigning in protest and airing their dissent outside the government . The most important asset that a man brings to bureaucratic life is his " effectiveness , " a mysterious combination of training , style , and connections . The most ominous complaint that can be whispered of a bureaucrat is : " I 'm afraid Charlie 's beginning to lose his effectiveness . " To preserve your effectiveness , you must decide where and when to fight the mainstream of policy ; the opportunities range from pillow talk with your wife , to private drinks with your friends , to meetings with the Secretary of State or the President . The inclination to remain silent or to acquiesce in the presence of the great men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue so that you can be " effective " on later issues ? is overwhelming . Nor is it the tendency of youth alone ; some of our most senior officials , men of wealth and fame , whose place in history is secure , have remained silent lest their connection with power be terminated . As for the disinclination to resign in protest : while not necessarily a Washington or even American specialty , it seems more true of a government in which ministers have no parliamentary backbench to which to retreat . In the absence of such a refuge , it is easy to rationalize the decision to stay aboard . By doing so , one may be able to prevent a few bad things from happening and perhaps even make a few good things happen . To exit is to lose even those marginal chances for " effectiveness . " Another factor must be noted : as the Vietnam controversy escalated at home , there developed a preoccupation with Vietnam public relations as opposed to Vietnam policy-making . And here , ironically , internal doubters and dissenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own doubts , were often deemed best able to " massage " the doubting intelligentsia . My senior East Asia colleague at the White House , a brilliant and humane doubter who had dealt with Indochina since 1954 , spent three quarters of his working days on Vietnam public relations : drafting presidential responses to letters from important critics , writing conciliatory language for presidential speeches , and meeting quite interminably with delegations of outraged Quakers , clergymen , aca- demics , and housewives . His regular callers were the late A. J. Muste and Norman Thomas ; mine were members of the Women 's Strike for Peace . Our orders from above : keep them off the backs of busy policy-makers ( who usually happened to be nondoubters ) . Incidentally , my most discouraging assignment in the realm of public relations was the preparation of a White House pamphlet entitled Why Vietnam , in September , 1965 ; in a gesture toward my conscience , I fought ? and lost ? a battle to have the title followed by a question mark . @# TROUGH a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissent , and expertise were effectively neutralized in the making of policy . But what can be said of the men " in charge " ? It is patently absurd to suggest that they produced such tragedy by intention and calculation . But it is neither absurd nor difficult to discern certain forces at work that caused decent and honorable men to do great harm . Here I would stress the paramount role of executive fatigue . No factor seems to me more crucial and underrated in the making of foreign policy . The physical and emotional toll of executive responsibility in State , the Pentagon , the White House , and other executive agencies is enormous ; that toll is of course compounded by extended service . Many of today 's Vietnam policymakers have been on the job for from four to seven years . Complaints may be few , and physical health may remain unimpaired , though emotional health is far harder to gauge . But what is most seriously eroded in the deadening process of fatigue is freshness of thought , imagination , a sense of possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new Administration in its first year or two of office . The tired policy-maker becomes a prisoner of his own narrowed view of the world and his own cliched rhetoric . He becomes irritable and defensive short on sleep , short on family ties , short on patience . Such men make bad policy and then compound it . They have neither the time nor the temperament for new ideas or preventive diplomacy . Below the level of the fatigued executives in the making of Vietnam policy was a widespread phenomenon : the curator mentality in the Department of State . By this I mean the collective inertia produced by the bureaucrat 's view of his job . At State , the average " desk officer " inherits from his predecessor our policy toward Country X ; he regards it as his function to keep that policy intact ? under glass , untampered with , and dusted so that he may pass it on in two to four years to his successor . And such curatorial service generally merits promotion within the system . ( Maintain the status quo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some circumstances , the inertia bred by such an outlook can act as a brake against rash innovation . But on many issues , this inertia sustains the momentum of bad policy and unwise commitments ? momentum that might otherwise have been resisted within the ranks . Clearly , Vietnam is such an issue . To fatigue and inertia must be added the factor of internal confusion . Even among the " architects " of our Vietnam commitment , there has been persistent confusion as to what type of war we were fighting and , as a direct consequence , confusion as to how to end that war . ( The " credibility gap " is , in part , a reflection of such internal confusion . ) Was it , for instance , a civil war , in which case counterinsurgency might suffice ? Or was it a war of international aggression ? ( This might invoke SEATO or UN commitment . ) Who was the aggressor ? and the " real enemy " ? The Viet Cong ? Hanoi ? Peking ? Moscow ? International Communism ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies and tactics . And confused throughout , in like fashion , was the question of American objectives ; your objectives depended on whom you were fighting and why . I shall not forget my assignment from an Assistant Secretary of State in March , 1964 : to draft a speech for Secretary McNamara which would , inter alia , once and for all dispose of the canard that the Vietnam conflict was a civil war . " But in some ways , of course , " I mused , " it is a civil war . " " Do n't play word games with me ! " snapped the Assistant Secretary . Similar confusion beset the concept of " negotiations " ? anathema to much of official Washington from 1961 to 1965 . Not until April , 1965 , did " unconditional discussions " become respectable , via a presidential speech ; even then the Secretary of State stressed privately to newsmen that nothing had changed , since " discussions " were by no means the same as " negotiations . " Months later that issue was resolved . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that negotiations might include the Viet Cong as something other than an appendage to Hanoi 's delegation . Given such confusion as to the whos and whys of our Vietnam commitment , it is not surprising , as Theodore Draper has written , that policy-makers find it so difficult to agree on how to end the war . Of course , one force ? a constant in the vortex of commitment ? was that of wishful thinking . I partook of it myself at many times . I did so especially during Washington 's struggle with Diem in the autumn of 1963 when some of us at State believed that for once , in dealing with a difficult client state , the U.S. government could use the leverage of our economic and military assistance  | to make good things happen , , instead of being led around by the nose by men like Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee ( and , in that particular instance , by Diem ) . If we could prove that point , I thought , and move into a new day , with or without Diem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the wishful thinking of the air-strike planners in the late autumn of 1964 ; there were those who actually thought that after six weeks of air strikes , the North Vietnamese would come crawling to us to ask for peace talks . And what , someone asked in one of the meetings of the time , if they do n't ? The answer was that we would bomb for another four weeks , and that would do , the trick . And a few weeks later came one instance of wishful thinking that was symptomatic of good men misled : in January , 1965 , I encountered one of the very highest figures in the Administration at a dinner , drew him aside , and told him of my worries about the air-strike option . He told me that I really should n't worry ; it was his conviction that before any such plans could be put into effect , a neutralist government would come to power in Saigon that would politely invite us out . And finally , there was the recurrent wishful thinking that sustained many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air strikes had begun : that surely , somehow , one way or another , we would " be in a conference in six months , " and the escalatory spiral would be suspended . The basis of our hope : " It simply ca n't go on . " As A further influence on policy-makers I would cite the factor of bureaucratic detachment . By this I mean what at best might be termed the professional callousness of the surgeon ( and indeed , medical lingo ? the " surgical strike " for instance ? seemed to crop up in the euphemisms of the times ) . In Washington the semantics of the military muted the reality of war for the civilian policy-makers . In quiet , air-conditioned , thickcarpeted rooms , such terms as " systematic pressure , " " armed reconnaissance , " " targets of opportunity , " and even " body count " seemed to breed a sort of games-theory detachment . Most memorable to me was a moment in the late 1964 target planning when the question under discussion was how heavy our bombing should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midpoint in the projected pattern of systematic pressure . An Assistant Secretary of State resolved the point in the following words : " It seems to me that our orchestration should be mainly violins , but with periodic touches of brass . " Perhaps the biggest shock of my return to Cambridge , Massachusetts , was the realization that the young men , the flesh and blood I taught and saw on these university streets , were potentially some of the numbers on the charts of those faraway planners . In a curious sense , Cambridge is closer to this war than Washington . There is an unprovable factor that relates to bureaucratic detachment : the ingredient of crptoracism . I do not mean to imply any conscious contempt for Asian loss of life on the part of Washington officials . But I do mean to imply that bureaucratic detachment may well be compounded by a traditional Western sense that there are so many Asians , after all ; that Asians have a fatalism about life and a disregard for its loss ; that they are cruel and barbaric to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ( and all look alike ? ) . And I do mean to imply that the upshot of such subliminal views is a subliminal question whether Asians , and particularly Asian peasants , and most particularly Asian Communists , are really people ? like you and me . To put the matter another way : would we have pursued quite such policies ? and quite such military tactics ? if the Vietnamese were white ? It is impossible to write of Vietnam decisionmaking without writing about language . Throughout the conflict , words have been of paramount importance . I refer here to the impact of rhetorical escalation and to the problem of oversell . In an important sense , Vietnam has become of crucial significance to us because we have said that it is of crucial significance . ( The issue obviously relates to the public relations preoccupation described earlier . ) The key here is domestic politics : the need to sell the American people , press , and Congress on support for an unpopular and costly war in which the objectives themselves have been in flux . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric . As the difficulties and costs have mounted , so has the definition of the stakes . This is not to say that rhetorical escalation is an orderly process ; executive prose is the product of many writers , and some concepts ? North Vietnamese infiltration , America 's " national honor , " Red China as the chief enemy ? have entered the rhetoric only gradually and even sporadically . But there is an upward spiral nonetheless . And once you have said that the American Experiment itself stands or falls on the Vietnam outcome , you have thereby created a national stake far beyond any earlier stakes . Crucial throughout the process of Vietnam decision-making was a conviction among many policy-makers : that Vietnam posed a fundamental test of America 's national will . Time and again I was told by men reared in the tradition of Henry L. Stimson that all we needed was the will , and we  | would then prevail . Implicit in such a view , it seemed to me , was a curious assumption that Asians lacked will , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonAsians must prevail . A corollary to the persistent belief in will was a fascination with power and an awe in the face of the power America possessed as no nation or civilization ever before . Those who doubted our role in Vietnam were said to shrink from the burdens of power , the obligations of power , the uses of power , the responsibility of power . By implication , such men were soft-headed and effete . Finally , no discussion of the factors and forces at work on Vietnam policy-makers can ignore the central fact of human ego investment . Men who have participated in a decision develop a stake in that decision . As they participate in further , related decisions , their stake increases . It might have been possible to dissuade a man of strong self-confidence at an early stage of the ladder of decision ; but it is infinitely harder at later stages since a change of mind there usually involves implicit or explicit repudiation of a chain of previous decisions . To put it bluntly : at the heart of the Vietnam calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been regularly and repeatedly wrong ? and whose standing with their contemporaries , and more important , with history , depends , as they see it , on being proven right . These are not men who can be asked to extricate themselves from error . THE various ingredients I have cited in the making of Vietnam policy have created a variety of results , most of them fairly obvious . Here are some that seem to me most central : Throughout the conflict , there has been persistent and repeated miscalculation by virtually all the actors , in high echelons and low , whether dove , hawk , or something else . To cite one simple example among many : in late 1964 and early 1965 , some peace-seeking planners at State who strongly opposed the projected bombing of the North urged that , instead , American ground forces be sent to South Vietnam ; this would , they said , increase our bargaining leverage against the North ? our " chips " ? and would give us something to negotiate about ( the withdrawal of our forces ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was urged by many in the military who were dead set against American participation in " another land war in Asia " ; they were joined by other civilian peace-seekers who wanted to bomb Hanoi into early negotiations . By late 1965 , we had ended up with the worst of all worlds : ineffective and costly air strikes against the North , spiraling ground forces in the South , and no negotiations in sight . Throughout the conflict as well , there has been a steady give-in to pressures for a military solution and only minimal and sporadic efforts at a diplomatic and political solution . In part this resulted from the confusion ( earlier cited ) among the civilians ? confusion regarding objectives and strategy . And in part this resulted from the self-enlarging nature of military investment . Once air strikes and particularly ground forces were introduced , our investment itself had transformed the original stakes . More air power was needed to protect the ground forces ; and then more ground forces to protect the ground forces . And needless to say , the military mind develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilians . Once asked to save South Vietnam , rather than to " advise " it , the American military could not but press for escalation . In addition , sad to report , assorted military constituencies , once involved in Vietnam , have had a series of cases to prove : for instance , the utility not only of air power ( the Air Force ) but of supercarrier-based air power ( the Navy ) . Also , Vietnam policy has suffered from one ironic byproduct of Secretary McNamara 's establishment of civilian control at the Pentagon : in the face of such control , interservice rivalry has given way to a united front among the military ? reflected in the new but recurrent phenomenon of JCS unanimity . In conjunction with traditional congressional allies ( mostly Southern senators and representatives ) such a united front would pose a formidable problem for any President . Throughout the conflict , there have been missed opportunities , large and small , to disengage ourselves from Vietnam on increasingly unpleasant but still acceptable terms . Of the many moments from 1961 onward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important opportunity that was lost : in the summer of 1964 the President instructed his chief advisers to prepare for him as wide a range of Vietnam options as possible for postelection consideration and decision . He explicitly asked that all options be laid out . What happened next was , in effect , Lyndon Johnson 's slow-motion Bay of Pigs . For the advisers so effectively converged on one single option ? juxtaposed against two other , phony options ( in effect , blowing up the world , or scuttleand-run ) ? that the President was confronted with unanimity for bombing the North from all his trusted counselors . Had he been more confident in foreign affairs , had he been deeply informed on Vietnam and Southeast Asia , and had he raised some hard questions that unanimity had submerged , this President could have used the largest electoral mandate in history to de-escalate in Vietnam , in the clear expectation that at the worst  | a neutralist government would come to power in Saigon and politely invite us out . Today , many lives and dollars later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive possibility . In the course of these years , another result of Vietnam decision-making has been the abuse and distortion of history . Vietnamese , Southeast Asian , and Far Eastern history has been rewritten by our policy-makers , and their spokesmen , to conform with the alleged necessity of our presence in Vietnam . Highly dubious analogies from our experience elsewhere ? the " Munich " sellout and " containment " from Europe , the Malayan insurgency and the Korean War from Asia ? have been imported in order to justify our actions . And more recent events have been fitted to the Procrustean bed of Vietnam . Most notably , the change of power in Indonesia in 1965 ? 1966 has been ascribed to our Vietnam presence ; and virtually all progress in the Pacific region the rise of regionalism , new forms of cooperation , and mounting growth rates ? has been similarly explained . The Indonesian allegation is undoubtedly false ( I tried to prove it , during six months of careful investigation at the White House , and had to confess failure ) ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , for the clear fact that the economies of both Japan and Korea have profited enormously from our Vietnam-related procurement in these countries ; but that is a costly and highly dubious form of foreign aid ) . There is a final result of Vietnam policy I would cite that holds potential danger for the future of American foreign policy : the rise of a new breed of American ideologues who see Vietnam as the ultimate test of their doctrine . I have in mind those men in Washington who have given a new life to the missionary impulse in American foreign relations : who believe that this nation , in this era , has received a threefold endowment that can transform the world . As they see it , that endowment is composed of , first , our unsurpassed military might ; second , our clear technological supremacy ; and third , our allegedly invincible benevolence ( our " altruism , " our affluence , our lack of territorial aspirations ) . Together , it is argued , this threefold endowment provides us with the opportunity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernization and stability : toward a fullfledged Pax Americana Technocratica . In reaching toward this goal , Vietnam is viewed as the last and crucial test . Once we have succeeded there , the road ahead is clear . In a sense , these men are our counterpart to the visionaries of Communism 's radical left : they are technocracy 's own Maoists . They do not govern Washington today . But their doctrine rides high . Long before I went into government , I was told a story about Henry L. Stimson that seemed to me pertinent during the years that I watched the Vietnam tragedy unfold ? and participated in that tragedy . It seems to me more pertinent than ever as we move toward the election of 1968 . In his waning years Stimson was asked by an anxious questioner , " Mr. Secretary , how on earth can we ever bring peace to the world ? " Stimson is said to have answered : " You begin by bringing to Washington a small handful of able men who believe that the achievement of peace is possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer believe that it is possible . " And then you throw them out ? and bring in a new bunch who believe that it is possible . "
