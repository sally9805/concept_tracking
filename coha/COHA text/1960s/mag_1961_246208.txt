Summing up , Adolf Eichmann said : " I have regret and condemnation for the extermination of the Jewish people , which was ordered by the German rulers , but I myself could not have done anything against it . I was a tool in the hands of the strong and powerful and in the hands of fate itself . . . Where there is no responsibility , there can be no guilt . " Thus , finishing 70 hours of testimony , he closed up the last of the brown folders from which he had produced mountains of documents , blew his nose heartily and leaned back to receive the onslaught of cross-questioning from Attorney General Gideon Hausner . <P> Fussy and long-winded , Eichmann had irritated his defense lawyer , Robert Servatius and three judges of the Israeli court . Loquaciously he had told ( though nobody asked him ) how his functions had grown to include confiscation of Jewish property and deciding which Jews were hostile to Germany . Affidavits from six former Nazi associates hurt him the most . They pictured Eichmann not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions . One called Eichmann " death 's great expediter . " <P> But under the circumstances . Eichmann had not done too badly for himself . He had some success in showing that he followed rather than originated orders . He disproved charges that his Bureau IV B 4 administered the death camps and showed that his job , organizing transportation to the death camps , was always carried out on orders from very senior Nazis . Said Servatius : " Eichmann and I are confident , and we feel some hope . ' ' <P> This was before Hausner began his crossexamination . At the prosecution table , Hausner had been waiting impatiently to begin the attack , fidgeting and rubbing his bald pate red . Speaking stridently , questioning vindictively . Hausner opened with a quick barrage . <P> " When you were interrogated by the police , you said . ' I know that I shall be found guilty of murder . . . I am ready to hang in public and atone for this terrible crime . ' Are you ready to repeat those words here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eichmann : " I do not deny what I said during interrogation . ' ' <P> " In your own heart , do you find yourself guilty as an accomplice to the murder of millions of Jews . Yes or No ? " <P> <P> " Yes , from the human point of view , because I was guilty of carrying out and implementing deportations . " <P> Reminding Eichmann of his oft-quoted statement in 1945 that " I will gladly leap into my grave knowing that 5,000,000 enemies of the Reich had been wiped out along with me , " Hausner hammered at Eichmann to get him to admit that he had considered the Jews to be the enemy , and finally Eichmann surrendered saying , " Yes , the Jews were the enemy . " <P> Shrilly Hausner asked if Eichmann believed that the Nrnberg death sentences carried out against top Nazis were just . Eichmann replied with a weak jawohl . When court recessed , Eichmann leaned forward dazedly , his head almost touching the glass of his protective cage .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
