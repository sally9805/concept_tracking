O , to be young and a correspondent in Hollywood . <P> " Showbiz scheduling cover on Raquel Welch . . . " read the query to Jonathan Larsen in our Los Angeles bureau . And indeed , says Larsen , " when I told people that I was going to interview Raquel Welch , everybody conjured up this image of her in a plunging minidress , batting her long eyelashes at me in seductive silence over a candlelit dinner . " Alas , it was n't like that at all , reports Jon . " Our first interview took place in broad daylight , with Raquel in a voluminous caftan , drinking Gatorade and complaining nonstop about the problems of being a modern sex goddess . " Despite that somewhat disappointing start , Larsen spent the better part of two weeks with Raquel , observing her on the set of Myra Breckinridge , interviewing her in her dressing room and back home . He found her refreshingly pleasant and outgoing . So did Mark Goodman , who wrote this week 's story and recently flew out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Raquel and her husband and friends . " I was impressed by her brightness , " says Goodman . " She is terribly concerned with her image-with the idea that she is only a screen personality and is not a bona fide person in people 's minds . " As a matter of fact , notes Goodman , it was curious to see that Raquel , for all her visibility , goes almost unrecognized by passers-by on the street . <P> The Cover : epoxy resin sculpture by Frank Gallo . Though Gallo 's slender , sexy swingers grace many museums and private collections around the world , this is his first for TIME and first of a real , live girl . The others have all been imaginary . The sculpture took three weeks to complete , and Gallo personally brought it from Champaign , Ill. , to New York-it sat beside him in a first-class Ozark Air Lines seat . At first the package was too bulky to get the seat belt around , so Gallo was obliged to unwrap it . That caused quite a stir on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Gallo , " and announced that they were pleased to have Myra Breckinridge on the flight with them today . "
