Oil derricks weathered under the south western sun ; tramp steamers rusted in their harbor slips . But the visitor from New York heeded neither the heat nor the scenery . Samuel I. Newhouse , 67 , had come to the Texas Gulf Coast port of Beaumont for only one reason - to run down a rumor that the city 's two news papers were for sale . Beyond that possibility , Beaumont held no charms for the little man from the big city . And when the rumor proved false , the visitor could not get out of town fast enough . <P> But Sam Newhouse 's unopened check book smoldered in his briefcase . Buying newspapers is not only his chief pleasure ; it is the purpose of his life . Surely there must be a paper for sale somewhere in the vicinity . On impulse , Sam headed for Houston . There he goggled at the sights : sleek Cadillacs schooling in the streets , glittering shops , new buildings all over the city , and more new buildings rising on nearly every block . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without pausing even to examine a copy of the Post , Hous ton 's leading daily , Newhouse sought out its co-proprietor , Mrs. Oveta Gulp Hobby , and put in a magnificently reckless bid . Would she sell him the paper for , say , $40 million cash ? No , said Mrs. Hobby politely , she would not . <P> Disappointed a second time , Sam Newhouse telephoned Newspaper Broker Allen Kander in Washington , D.C. He was down South . Where could he buy a newspaper ? Try New Orleans , Kander suggested . Newhouse did . And just two weeks after that long-distance phone call , U.S. journalism 's smallest publisher ( 5 ft. 3 in. , 136 Ibs. ) closed the biggest deal in U.S. journalistic history . For $42 million-more than three times what the Louisiana Territory cost the U.S. in 1803-Newhouse bought both of New Orleans ' papers : the morning Times-Picayune ( circ. 195,151 daily , 307 , - 983 Sunday ) and its evening companion , the States-Item ( 163,650 ) . * <P> The Louisiana purchase not only set a record but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With 19 dailies having a combined daily and Sunday circulation of 5,700,000 , he now owns , in whole or part , more newspapers than anyone else in the U.S. ; he has one more than the Scripps-Howard chain , eight more than the shriveled empire governed by the descendants of William Randolph Hearst ( although the circulation of Scripps-Howard and Hearst each exceeds that of the Newhouse papers ) . Nor does Newhouse 's ascendancy end there . Scripps-Howard , Hearst , and the whole U.S. newspaper field are contracting . Newhouse is still growing-at such an exponential rate that the price he paid for New Orleans is almost one-third the cost of all his other properties combined . Among the country 's newspaper giants , Sam Newhouse seems to know best how to make daily newspapering pay . <P> " You Run It . " He has successfully made money out of newspapers for 40 years . Beginning with the $49,000 he invested in 1922 for a slice of the tiny , money-losing Staten Island Advance , he has spent some $122 million collecting properties that now include not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations and two magazine publishing firms , a 66% interest in Conde Nast and Street &; Smith . By conservative estimate , these possessions are worth $250 million today . They produce a handsome annual gross in excess of $125 million . <P> This solid-gold pyramid was erected by a man who
