Angry pacifists rampage through the streets of Frankfurt , Hamburg and Munich in protest against West German membership in NATO . The CIA reports that they will burn down barracks of foreign troops next day . Though West German police can not cope , Chancellor Erhard 's Cabinet decides not to call out the army . The U.S. , French and British ambassadors meet , proclaim a state of emergency , dissolve the Bundestag and jail the Cabinet . <P> Fantastic ? The situation , perhaps-but , due to a curious anachronism , the solution would be perfectly legal . Under the 1955 Bonn Convention , in which the Allies recognized West Germany 's sovereignty , the three powers retained the right not only to occupy Berlin but also to declare a state of emergency in West Germany and rule by decree , if necessary , to ensure the security of their forces . The Allies agreed to relinquish this right only when the Bonn government enacted its own " emergency legislation . " * The trouble is , Bonn still has not done it . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . The Christian Democrats have proposed emergency legislation three times in the past eleven years , but since it would amount to a constitutional revision , they need a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag to enact it . Willy Brandt 's Social Democrats have always opposed the bills , partly because they disagreed with various clauses , but mainly because of the implacable opposition of the trade unions to the whole idea . Union leaders are still haunted by memories of 1933 , when Adolf Hitler , upon the famous pretext of the Reichstag fire , used Article 48 , the emergency provision of the Weimar Republic 's constitution , to suspend constitutional guarantees and turn the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich . <P> <P> This year the Social Democrats decided to ignore the unions and work out a compromise emergency bill with the Christian Democrats . Within weeks , the bipartisan effort was near success . Prospects looked so good , in fact , that the German Trade Union Federation came out sternly against the bill , and the 1,900,000-member Metal Workers Union called for protest demonstrations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next September 's national election , the Socialists lamely backed down and announced they would not vote for the bill after all . <P> <P> * Also retained by the Allies , under the same arrangement : the exclusive right to tap telephone and telegraph wires and sample mail-privileges that have proved invaluable in keeping tab on the free world 's largest ( 16,000 to 20,000 ) network of Communist agents .
