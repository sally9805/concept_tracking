When a boy from Berkeley joins the Peace Corps to teach young Ghanaians , that 's idealism with a touch of glamour ; when he signs up to teach in Harlem , that 's plain idealism . When a Kansas nurse helps Pakistani psychotics , that 's useful and also exotic ; when she helps Navajo neurotics , that 's just useful . Last week the Kennedy Administration approved the blueprint for a project abundantly idealistic and daringly short of glamour : the domestic Peace Corps , probably to be known by the undramatic title of National Service Corps. * <P> The Administration expects hot objections , typified by Ohio Senator Frank Lausche 's recent blast that ' ' we have legions of Peace Corps workers already in our country " - he mentioned ministers , parents , teachers , social workers , the police , and parole officers . The Administration argues that thousands of idealistic students and others need a Government agency ( probably under the Health , Education and Welfare Department ) to organize , pay and steer them into good works . " We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says a White House study group . <P> The goal is to alleviate some conditions uncomfortably similar to those of countries where the Peace Corps works . The White House is concerned about : <P> &gt;An estimated 30% of youths entering the U.S. labor force in the 1960s will not have finished high school . Some 23% of all nonwhite adults in the U.S. are " functional illiterates " - unable to read even want ads . <P> <P> &gt; Most children of the nation 's 500,000 migrant workers ( average annual wage : $911 ) receive little or no schooling . The same goes for the nation 's 285,000 reservation-bound American Indians . U.S. jails , prisons and reformatories hold thousands of people " desperately in need of basic education and training . " <P> &gt; More than 165,000 new Cuban refugees include 13.000 children without parents . An estimated 35% of all mothers in big cities can not afford prenatal care . <P> NSC alone can not possibly produce solutions . As currently planned , its function is to be a kind of " Precept Corps " - sending small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local people and working under their orders . By example , the volunteers are supposed to spur greater local action-soon working themselves out of a job and moving on to another trouble spot . <P> Harvesting Idealism . NSC aims to start small with 500 volunteers by midsummer , probably hit peak strength in three years with 3,000 to 5,000 members . It will cost then about $10 million a year ( one-sixth of this year 's Peace Corps budget ) . For recruits , it will rely heavily on students and retired people , demanding slightly lower physical standards than the overseas Peace Corps . Domestic corpsmen need not be college graduates , but will have to be U.S. citizens aged at least 18 ( no top limit ) , with warm , steady characters and almost any useful skill . They will get four to six weeks ' training at colleges and universities , serve for one year without pay , get mustering-out pay of about $900 . Though draft-deferred , they will not be exempt from later military service . As Interior Secretary Stewart Udall recently put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have let lie fallow here at home .
