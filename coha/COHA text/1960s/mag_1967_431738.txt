 | Dusk ? The Magic Hour @# I REMEMBER a day when I was very small , and my mother took me to a fair , and I got lost . After searching without finding her , I set out for home by myself . I walked up one road , down another , expecting to stumble on something recognizable . But everywhere the unfamiliar houses seemed unfriendly and forbidding . Afraid to knock on any door , I crept close to a tree in an empty corner lot and fell into the sleep of exhaustion . At dusk I awakened . The first of night was seeping into the neighborhood , shadow by shadow . A pale wash of sunset pinked chimneys and rooftops . As I watched , the sky @#  | shook my bones with arriving joy . " But almost as good as returning home at day 's end is the exhilarating business of faring forth then . There is no better time to take a train to the city than in the precious interval between day and night , when the blue air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or to walk in a quiet country lane as the sparrows cheep sleepily , and night insects awaken to begin a fine musical clamor . Listen to that cricket ! In that hour , an ordinary neighborhood stroll has an atmosphere of expectancy . Glimpsed through lamplit windows , everybody seems to be getting ready for something . Before her mirror , a pretty girl puts on makeup . In the front room , a boy builds a fire . And look , in the next house , that elegant lady lighting candles ? there 's going to be a party . Meanwhile , nearly forgotten , the last lovely light of day is caught on a pond and behind a hill , back of your barn and around the corner . But when you look again , it will be gone . To go out . . . to go somewhere and meet the evening ... . What happiness for a child to burst from the house to play in the hide-and-seek dusk ! As the hour grows later , the games become marvelously harder . " I see Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a witching shadow ? An elusive greenish-yellow gleam flashes , then another . Fireflies ! The darkened to the deep , translucent blue of almost-evening , and a brilliant first star appeared ? my own reliable wishing star , right where it belonged . Suddenly my world was righted . This was the magic time when wishes were made and faces washed , when daddies appeared and babies had baths ? a friendly time . Without hesitation , I ran to the nearest door and banged on it . Within an hour I was safely home . My parents asked why I had waited so long to seek help . I could not explain . I can not now , except to say that the enchantment of dusk is still upon me , still smooths away my fears and lifts my spirit . I dare more at dusk . The lights come on , for one thing ? the companionable lights .

Dusk is for homecoming , a wonderfully **27;672;TOOLONG hour . Telling of his boyhood in a small English village , Laurie Lee writes exuberantly , " The day was over and we had used it , running errands or prowling the fields . We returned to the kitchen , back to its smoky comfort . Every stone in the path as I ran down home  | hunt is on . Running , shouting , hot cheeks soothed by the cooling air , boys and girls call from up and down the riverbank , " Got one ? " " Got more'n you ! " Lovers wander hand in hand , paying no attention to the packs of children . A favorite trysting place in our town is a wooden bridge over a little rocky waterfall . Young couples meet there .

" Someday I 'll meet you at sunset , the way I used to , " a boy wrote his girl from Vietnam . She mentioned the letter to me . That evening I saw her standing alone on the bridge . Through the long , memory-crowded dusk , she stood there , throwing pebbles into the water . I have a friend who often sits by herself on the porch after supper . " I love the smell of sundown , " she told me once , and the odd phrase stayed with me . Never again can I be oblivious to the smells that mark the seasons at twilight . To a certain muddy March freshness , when t air has a balmy promise .

Byrd wrote : " In t northeast a silver-green serpentine aurora pulsed and quivered gently The day was dying , the night being born ? but with great peace . In that instant I could feel no doubt of man 's oneness with the universe The conviction came that there must be a purpose in the whole , and that man was part of that purpose . " In the measureless blue of twilight , one glimpses , perhaps , a mystery and meaning beyond the turn of this trivial whirling stone on which we live . @#
