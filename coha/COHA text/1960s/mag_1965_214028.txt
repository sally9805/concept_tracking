For Walter Ulbricht , goateed leader of the most escaped-from satellite in the Soviet bloc , it was a week of rare triumph . Arriving in Egypt for his first official visit outside the Iron Curtain , the East German President was greeted at the Cairo railroad station by Nasser , a 21-gun salute , 23 non-Western ambassadors and 20,000 students and workers chanting a heartwarming slogan : " America , withdraw your money for Israel or Nasser will step on you . " <P> There were trips to a textile factory , Luxor and the Aswan High Dam . There was a state banquet at which Ulbricht and Nasser exchanged their countries ' highest awards . To Nasser went East Germany 's Order of the Grand Golden Star for International Friendship , to Ulbricht went Egypt 's Great Collar of the Order of the Nile-and , to Ulbricht 's wife Lotte , the Great Collar of the Order of Perfection . <P> That was about the only sign of perfection along the Nile last week , for Ulbricht was an expensive guest in a febrile situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with West Germany for its secret arms shipments to Israel . When suspension of the shipments failed to head off the visit , Bonn retaliated . Over the past six years Bonn has supplied Egypt with more than $400 million in hard currency loans and development aid , and last week Chancellor Ludwig Erhard canceled all further financial support . <P> Nasser claimed that this would hurt German trade more than Egypt and looked for aid elsewhere . A French technical mission is currently touring the country scouting possible projects ; Poland has already offered to take up some of the slack ; and Ulbricht himself has committed $83 million in East German money . <P> Backing Nasser , the 13-member Arab League warned that resumption of the arms shipments would force them to break relations with Bonn and , presumably , recognize the East German regime . Still , Nasser was moving carefully . He withheld full recognition from East Germany , and in a remarkable aside to Ulbricht , he said : " I need n't explain to you the deplorable and painful circumstances surrounding our relations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid further worsening in the current state of affairs . " He also went out of his way to underline Egypt 's " radical differences with Communist ideology . We believe in religion and refuse dictatorship by any class . "
