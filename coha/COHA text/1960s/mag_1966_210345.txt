According to baseball 's version of the Chinese calendar , 1962 was the Year of the Stealer , 1963 was the Year of the Pitcher , 1964 was the Year the Phillies Folded , and 1965 was the Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant . So far , 1966 is clearly the Year of the Tape Measure . <P> Ballplayers must be stronger , or the ball must be livelier , or the air must be thinner , because the way this season is going , a horse-or at least his hide-will get to the moon before a man . In one game last week , Braves Outfielder Hank Aaron , no heavyweight , twice flicked his wrists and twice sent liners whistling high over Atlanta Stadium 's 400-ft. - deep leftfield wall . In Washington , awed witnesses reported that a drive hit by Senators Outfielder Frank Howard was still climbing when it caromed off the centerfield seats 480 ft. from home plate and 75 ft. above the ground . In Baltimore , the Orioles ' Frank Robinson topped even that by becoming the first player ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baseball was finally located lying in a parking lot 540 ft. away . <P> Stinging Tributes . Those feats are minor sensations compared to the springtime heroics of a pair of rookies named Rick Reichardt and George Scott . " I do n't have a natural home-run swing . My arms are too short , " says Outfielder Reichardt , a 23-year-old Wisconsin lad who signed a $200,000 contract with the Los Angeles Angels in 1964-thereby making him the most beautiful bonus baby of all time . Rick 's first act as a pro was to step into the batting cage at Chavez Ravine and belt a ball straight over the 410-ft. sign in dead centerfield . <P> A solid 6-ft. 3-in. 210-pounder , Reichardt insists that he has not yet begun to hit . Earlier this month , he tied a big-league record by hitting two home runs in one inning . And last week he ranked ninth in the American League in batting ( .304 ) , second in home runs ( eight ) , fifth in RBIs ( 18 ) and first in getting hit by pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sting-but they are the sincerest tribute any pitcher can pay a batter . <P> Too Big &; Too Good . Hardly anybody throws at George Scott-and that 's another kind of tribute . The rookie first baseman of the Boston Red Sox is sturdier ( at 6 ft. 2 in. , 217 Ibs. ) and maybe even stronger than Reichardt . He also is a straightaway swinger who hits his hardest shots right back through the middle-over the pitcher 's mound . So opponents have concentrated instead on varying their pitches , probing for a weakness . New York 's canny Whitey Ford figured a high fastball might be just the ticket-until Scott hit it 500 ft. into the upper deck at Yankee Stadium . Two weeks ago , Scott and the Red Sox invaded Minnesota for a four-game series . Twins Pitcher Dave Boswell tried to sneak in a waist-level fastball ; Scott drove it 365 ft. into the rightfield stands . Then Al Worthington experimented with a wide , high curve ; George hit that 365 ft. into the leftfield stands . Finally , in desperation , Jim Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around sadly to watch the ball sail 443 ft. into the centerfield bleachers.
