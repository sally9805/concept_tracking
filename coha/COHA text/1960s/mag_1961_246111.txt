Ever since 1948 , skivvy-clad sprinters have strained to get a stride in front of Mel Patton 's sizzling 9.3 sec. world record for the 100-yd. dash . Although ten men have matched his time , * no one yet has raced past Patton into the record book . But this year the old champ has a new , more dangerous challenger : San Jose State 's cocky Dennis Johnson , a whippet-fast Jamaican who is undefeated in eleven straight races , and this month became the first runner in history to tie Patton 's world record four times in a single season . Says Johnson : " I should break the record this summer . I 'll do it the first time I get any competition . " <P> Olympic Flop . Born in Kingston , 22-year-old Sprinter Johnson ran the 100 in 11.5 sec. at the age of twelve , and caught the eye of Jamaican Track Star Herb McKenley . The ex-Olympian painstakingly tutored Johnson for six years , coached him to Jamaican high school records of 9.6 sec. in the 100 , 21.1 sec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1959 he entered Bakersfield ( Calif . ) College , and cut his running times to a creditable 9.4 sec. in the 100 , 20.6 in the 220 . Unhappy with his poor showing in the 1960 Olympics-he started sloppily , was eliminated in the loo-meter quarter-finals-Johnson transferred to San Jose State to work under canny Track Coach Lloyd ( " Bud " ) Winter , who developed U.S. Sprinters Ray Norton and Bobby Poynter . <P> Together , Johnson and Winter carefully studied movies of Germany 's gabby Olympic Champion Armin Hary . They decided that Hary won his races at the start . " I knew my own start was terrible , " says Johnson . He tried moving his starting blocks back farther than normal , rising more leisurely into the " set " ' position , taking a quicker first stride to get the jump on the rest of the field . Purpose of the " slow rising " technique , says Winter , is to keep Johnson completely relaxed until the moment the starter 's gun fires . " Our research shows that reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flap . Johnson 's new start has worked so well ( last month he ran a wind-aided 9.2 ; fortnight ago , at Fresno 's West Coast Relays , he won in 9.4 despite a strained groin muscle ) that rival coaches are screaming foul . Occidental College 's Chuck Coker argues that Johnson is using an illegal " rolling start " ; that he is in motion before the starter 's gun . The University of Illinois ' Leo Johnson has threatened to force changes in N.C.A.A. track rules to ban his namesake 's " questionable " technique . But most track officials agree with Coach Winter that Sprinter Johnson 's starts are perfectly proper . " There 's nothing remotely illegal about Dennis ' start . " says Winter . " The only sin he 's committed is to run 9.3 . " Johnson himself is unconcerned by the ruckus . " I 've never had any complaint , not even a black look , " he says , " from any of the guys I 've raced against . All I get from them are congratulations .
