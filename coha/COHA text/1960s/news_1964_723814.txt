txt A decision that hospitals built with Federal aid may not segregate their patients or their staffs was left standing today by the Supreme Court . The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , dividing 3 to 2 , handed down the decision last November . It ' held unconstitutional a pro vision of the Federal hospital aid law authorizing separatebut-equal facilities . Today the Supreme Court declined to review the case . As is customary in such actions , it gave no reasons . But the circumstances made it all but certain that the effect would be a new and broad assault on racial practices in the South . The N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund , which handled the case , hailed the Supreme Court 's action , saying it would " affect 2,000 hospital and medical facilities throughout the South . " Hailed as ' Entering Wedge ' Jack Greenberg , directorcounsel of the fund , said the decision would " put an end to keeping Negroes , out of white hospitals or segregating them within the hospitals , and requiring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they wanted treatment . " He went on : " It will be an entering wedge for Negro physicians into the mainstream of medical practice in the South . We wait to see whether the medical profession will voluntarily follow the law or whether a long , hard process of litigation such as we have had with schools will be necessary . " The immediate legal effect will be in the Fourth Circuit , which covers Maryland , Virginia , West Virginia and North and South Carolina . All Federal courts there are now bound by the rule against hospital segregation , The other Southern states are in the Fifth Circuit , except for Arkansas , which is in the Eighth , and Tennessee , in the Sixth . These other circuits could differ with the Fourth , but the best guess is that they probably will not . The case at issue today involved two hospitals at Greensboro , N. C. The Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital admitted only a few Negro patients and gave no staff privileges to Negro doctors or dentists when the case began , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider Negro staff applications . The Wesley Long Community Hospital , so far as the legal record shows , is completely segregated . Both are nonprofit hospitals operated under North Carolina law as private charitable corporations . But both have had substantial Federal aid in recent construction , Cone $1,269 , - 950 and Long $1,948,800 . The aid was given under the Hill-Burton Act of 1946 , named for Senators Lister Hill , an Alabama Democrat , and Harold H. Burton , an Ohio Republican who later went to the Supreme Court . The act forbids discrimination in general , but with this key proviso : " An exception shall be made in cases where separate hospital facilities are provided for separate population groups , if the plan makes equitable provision on the basis of need for facilities and services of like quality for each group . " It was this proviso that the Fourth Circuit held unconstitutional . The opinion was by Chief Judge Simon E. Sobeloff . The key question before the Court of Appeals was whether the hospitals were so private in character that they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination by governmental action . State 's Role Noted Judge Sobelof r found that there was deep involvement on North Carolina 's part in the two hospitals . He relied heavily on the fact that the Hill-Burton Act itself required state participation in several ways , such as making an over-all state hospital plan . Thus the Fourth Circuit concluded that these hospitals were too public in character to practice segregation . The logic of the opinion would seem to apply to any other institution receiving Hill-Burton aid . The suit was originally brought by 11 Negro doctors , dentists and patients . The Justice Department intervened on their side , agreeing that the Hill-Button proviso was unconstitutional and that segregation at the hospitals should be enjoined . The decision could have some impact on the forthcoming civil rights debate in the Senate . The bill as passed by the House declares void all segregation provisions of Federal law , such as the Hill-Burton proviso . And it orders agencies giving direct aid to end segregation in the programs . This case could be said to accomplish part of the objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have far less sweeping effects than a general Congressional command to end discrimination in Federally aided projects .
