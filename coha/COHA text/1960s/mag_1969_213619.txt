Once upon a time there lived in New York City a little boy named Danny Reeves whose father was very rich . <P> When Danny and his friends wanted to play touch football , dad 's chauffeur would drive them to the playground in a long , shiny automobile . That was fun , but for Danny the greatest fun of all was the idea of some day having a foot ball team of his very own , Why ? As Danny once told a friend : " Is n't it the dream of every American boy to own a football team ? " For Danny , at least , it was . So , in 1941 , when he was 28 years old , he went out and bought himself a team named the Rams and later he found them a nice home in Los Angeles . <P> It was wonderful . There were lots of All-America players to buy and trade A big stadium to fill with cheering fans Coaches to advise And , best of all , there was the fun of going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football with friends . The only trouble was that too often Danny 's team lost more games than it won , once for seven seasons in a row . That got to be boring and , in an effort to liven things up , Danny kept switching coaches . When he fired No. 6 just two days before Christmas of 1965 , some people said that he had become too difficult to work with . Danny could not understand that . As he often said , football was , after all , just " fun and games . " <P> Exclusive Toy . Then , three years ago , Danny offered the coaching job to George Allen . Danny had to fight a nasty legal battle to free him from the Chicago Bears ' coaching staff , but eventually he got his way . The players loved Allen ; in the past two seasons they won 21 games , lost four and tied three . The fans loved Allen too , but Danny was unhappy . For one thing , Allen , the son of a factory worker , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For another thing , people were beginning to refer to Danny 's team as George 's team . Back at the Bel-Air , Danny told his pals that the way Coach Allen drove the players at practice and worked 18 hours a day " takes all the pleasure out of owning a team . " Somehow , he sighed , it was " more fun " losing with the other coaches than winning with George . So , not wanting to appear mean again , he waited until the day after Christmas to tell Allen that " this is the end . " <P> George Allen cried . One group of fans burned Danny in effigy . Others picketed Danny 's office and formed a citizens ' council to reinstate the coach . The players took a poll of the team and reported that 38 out of 40 loved Allen . Eight of them said that if he left , they would too . The team , said All-Pro Defensive Tackle Merlin Olsen , was not " the exclusive toy of a rich man . " Danny was hurt , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more say in management , he tried to stand up to the big guys . He would not be pressured , he said , and if they did not like it , well , he would take his football team and go home .
