Into the Federal Aviation Agency 's headquarters in Washington last week were carted more than three tons of closely guarded papers . The stacks of documents were the entries of three of the nation 's leading planemakers-Boeing , Lockheed , and North American Aviation-in the biggest design competition in the history of U.S. civil aviation . At stake is the Government contract , worth at least $750 million , to build a supersonic transport . <P> The companies are under strict orders to keep their proposals secret , but enough has already leaked out to produce some reasonably accurate ideas about designs for the SST , as the supersonic is known in aviation . The most salient point about the U.S. SSTs is their unexpected size . All three planemakers proposed SSTs measuring about 210 ft. in length ( v. 153 ft. for the longest Boeing 707 and 180 ft. for the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic ) . The big planes are designed to carry 150 to 210 passengers , depending on seating arrangements , and attain a speed of Mach 3 ( three times the speed of sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To withstand the heat generated by the higher speed , the U.S. supersonics will be built of titanium and stainless steel . <P> The major difference among the U.S. designs is in the wings . Drawing on its experience as builder of the Air Force 's RS-70 , which will be rolled out within the next two months , North American has used the combination of a small stabilizing fin and a delta-wing for its SST design . Lockheed 's proposal features a delta-wing design similar to the Concorde 's . Boeing 's design is the most advanced , employing a " variable-sweep " wing that can be adjusted to different settings . By extending its wings , Boeing 's SST could take off and land at the same speeds as supersonic jets , tucking in its wings for swift supersonic flight . <P> The SST proposals-along with the power-plant proposals submitted by General Electric , United Aircraft and Curtiss-Wright-will be evaluated by a team of 210 Government aeronautical experts , will also be studied by the nation 's airlines . If the FAA decides that the designs of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the final contracts will be awarded in May . Otherwise the two leaders in each category will be placed in a one-year design competition to decide the winners . Even if contracts are awarded in May , the U.S. can hardly hope to get its SST into commercial service before 1972 , two years later than the rival Concorde . But the world 's airlines are so confident that the U.S. will produce a superior plane that they have already placed 70 orders for whatever plane is finally built v. only 49 orders for the Concorde .
