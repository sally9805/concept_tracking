AS EVERY Southerner knows , there is a sharp distinction between the truth and the sure ' nuff truth . One is concerned with facts , the other with essence . The only inheritance I got from my two grandfathers ? one a Confederate , the other a Union man ? was the sure ' nuff truth about the Civil War . It sounded a lot different from the truth put out by the historians . For this reason , however , I have begun to suspect that it might be a vital asset to the national economy . For a major industry , the writing of Civil War books , is now sputtering to a dead stop because it has run out of raw material . The official records and generals ' memoirs were used up long ago ; prospectors armed with Geiger counters have rummaged through every attic in the country in search of letters and diaries ; and by late 1960 the last surviving scraps of paper , front every sutler , cook , and camp follower who could write , had been run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thousands of writers , printers , and booksellers are facing unemployment ? even though the Centennial which starts this month has four years to run and the demand for Civil War books apparently remains as insatiable as ever . Under * Notably Catton 's Nostalgia Foundry and the Miers Distillery , bottler of 90-proof blood.the circumstances I do n't feel that in good conscience I can keep my little hoard of raw material cached away any longer . The first bit of sure ' nuff truth I picked up ? at about the age of six ? was that the Civil War was fun . This seems to have escaped the historians and all of the stuffier generals , such as Sherman . ( Not Lec . He believed it might be fortunate that war is a bloody business , lest men learn to like it too much . And until the Battle of Yellow Tavern Jeb Stuart evidently regarded the whole thing as a wonderful lark . ) Anyhow , as my grandfathers told it the war was a four-year picnic , with fireworks . A partial explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's memories , which filter out the unpleasant . ( My Confederate data trickled through a double filter . Because my Grandfather Caperton died before I was born , his story reached me secondhand , mostly from three uncles . ) Certainly both youngsters , like any other soldiers , were often cold , hungry , scared , and in pain . But I am pretty sure that on the whole they had an uproarious good time . For one thing , neither of them had to walk . The Caperton family ( none of whose members has ever cared for walking ) managed to spare one of its plow horses so that George could enlist in the Fourth Alabama Cavalry . Grandfather Fischer was born beside the Ohio , on a farm near Marietta. and from the time he was old enough to lift a hoe he had looked with envy at the sailors lounging on the decks of the paddle-wheelers that steamed past . So at the age of twelve he signed up as a cabin boy on one of Commodore Foote 's gunboats . " One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me later , " was when they paid me off at the end of the war and sent me back to that damned farm . " They ate better than most . The cavalry had endless chances to steal chickens , hogs , and roasting ears ( plus an occasional jug of whiskey ) , and it is one of America 's oldest military traditions that the Navy always gets better food , and more of it , than the Army . Their bloodshed was modest . That old infantry jibe ? " Who ever saw a dead cavalryman ? "  - -  was n't quite fair , but it was n't altogether baseless either . And among the river sailors , squatting behind their armor of boiler plate and railroad rails , the casualty rate was lower still . Finally , my grandfathers found time between battles for some memorable parties . The Fourth Alabama was commanded by disciplinarians ? Nathan Bedford Forrest and later Joe Wheeler ? who never encouraged the sort of carousing which was legendary among Stuart 's troopers ; but they could n't prevent a campfire brawl now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowie knife argument , in which George Caperton got his most serious , if not exactly glorious , wound . ( Later he broke an arm when a horse was Om out from under him at Shiloh . Since the surgeons were n't bothering with trifles at the time , he never got it properly set and carried a lump of ill-knit bone for the rest of his life . ) CABIN BOY John Fischer got his only wound , his biggest party , and his worst disgrace in the Vicksburg campaign . He had volunteered for service on one of the transports which Admiral David Porter had chosen for the supposedly desperate race clown the Mississippi under the muzzles of the Vicksburg batteries , on the night of April 16 , Some sixty years later he told me about it , during the course of a long , hot afternoon of post-hole digging , in words about like this : " Everybody except Grant and Porter thought the scheme was crazy . While I was cleaning up the officers ' mess table I heard them say that even Sherman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bound to be sunk before we could steam a hundred yards beyond Big Bend , All that afternoon T helped stack cotton bales and barrels of hardtack along the rail , to give the deck hands a little cover . They made a mighty flimsy looking breastwork , and I figured that I 'd never live to see morning . " What really happened was a sort of anticlimax . The night was real dark , and of course there was n't a single candle or seegar alight in our whole string of ships . Besides , we stuck close to the west bank , so that the Reb gunners could n't see us too well even after they set afire some barns and houses to light up the river . " But they sure tried . For nearly two hours they blazed away with every cannon they could bring to bear , and I guess maybe ten thousand riflemen kept popping at us as fast as they could load . I watched the whole thing through a crack between two cotton bales , jumping like a rabbit every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aground and sank , and all the others got splintered up pretty bad ? but we did n't lose a man . " Seemed like I was always hungry those days , like a teen-age boy generally is , and as soon as the shooting was over I slipped along the deck till I found a smashed cracker barrel . I started eating hardtack as fast as I could stuff it in my mouth , aiming to get my fill before an officer caught me . In the dark I could n't see that a ball had stuck in one of those crackers , and I broke a tooth . It . was n't what you could call a combat wound , I guess , but it was caused by an enemy weapon . " Toward the end of the campaign some of the transports were ordered to Natchez for repair . In those days it was two towns ? a dignified cluster of porticoed mansions on the bluff , and below it a rowdy port , Natchez-under-the-Hill . " The minute we tied up , " my grandfather said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were loud and plentiful . But the Captaintold me and Henry that the cabin boys would have to stay and look after the ship . He also ordered us to have plenty of hot coffee ready by daybreak , on the theory that he and the other officers would need it when they got back . " Neither of us knew much about cooking , but we filled a ten-gallon wash boiler full of water and ten pounds of coffee and set it on the galley stove . By midnight it was boiling good , but an awful lot of coffee grounds seemed to he floating on the top . " Now somewhere I had heard that eggshells would settle coffee grounds . Henry argued that did n't stand to reason . What the situation called for was something with more body to it , like whole eggs . So we broke a dozen eggs into the boiler and stirred for a while . That helped some , but not much . So we added another dozen , and threw in the shells after them . " Naturally we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Henry found a bottle of vanilla extract in the pantry we decided to have a party of our own . Come daylight , we were smelling like a pair of angel-food cakes . At about that point it occurred to us that the coffee better be real good when the Captain got home . We broke in all the rest of the eggs in the galley , including those which were n't too fresh , and we were stirring hard when the officers wobbled up the gangplank . " In spite of all the pains we had taken , the Captain was n't happy about that coffee . In fact , he was downright irritable . Said we tried to poison him . Said we probably were Rebel spies . Said that anyhow we were no-good brats , and we would sure God spend the rest of the war in the brig . " Maybe we would have , too , if the officers had n't got tired of waiting on their own table . We never were officially pardoned , exactly , but the First Officer let us out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " FOR officers in general my grandfather had scant respect . Sherman , for example , he described as " a nervous ol ' fuss-budget " who nearly lost the Army of the Tennessee at Shiloh out of sheer carelessness , and who was saved only by the last-minute arrival of the river flotilla with firepower and reinforcements . But Grant , he admitted , " probably knew what he was up to . " Sometimes he added that " Grant was n't as flighty as most of them generals " ? a rare compliment from the old man , who regarded flightiness ( or any other display of emotion ) with chill contempt . This judgment apparently was based less on Grant 's record of victories than on a cabin boy 's observation of his behavior under fire . Grandpa 's best chance for a close-up appraisal came at the siege of Fort Donelson . For hours there the gunboats tossed shells into the Confederate entrenchments , while Grant watched from the river bank a few yards away . The weather was near freezing and an icy rain fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in his saddle like a wet chicken , " Grandpa remembered , " while the water dripped down his coat collar and the Reb cannon halls splashed mud all over his boots . " For his juvenile listener this was exciting stuff ? an eyeball witness 's account Of History in the Making . I nagged for details . What I wanted , I suppose , though I did n't know how to ask for it , was an insight into the character of a hero , some explanation of what it is that makes a great man great . What did he do to win that battle ? " He did n't do anything so far as I could see , " Grandpa said . " He just sat there like a hickory stump . " Well , then , how did he really look ? " He looked cold . " That was as close to the sure ' nuff truth about Grant as I ever got . At the time it seemed unsatisfactory , but years later I began to suspect that it summed up the essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hickory stump . EVERY one of the Southern children I knew in my knee-pants days would confess , when pressed , that : 1 . Before " The War " his family had owned a thousand slaves . ( Never 973 or 1,012 ; always an even thousand. ) 2 . It lived in a mansion with white columns in front . 3 . Not only was it aristocratic ? that went without saying ? hut wealthy until the Yankees ruined everything . For a long while I assumed that the Southern half of my family had enjoyed this vanished grandeur , like everybody else . Then , over the years . I gradually picked up from my innumerable kinfolk the disillusioning sure ' nuff truth : 1 . The Capertons had owned three slaves . Each of these had a large family , but nobody seemed sure whether the wives and children were slaves or not . While the Caperton men were off at war , the Negroes worked the farm , hid the livestock from Yankee raiders , and in general took good care of the little community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column which marchedacross the farm on its way to Chickamauga , a few miles to the east , they thanked the soldiers kindly , cheered the Stars and Stripes , and went right back to work . After the war they stayed on , living the same as always ; and when the family moved to Texas in 1891 , an ex-slave ? Wellesley Caperton ? went along . ( He found the Panhandle too windy and lonesome , and finally moved back to Dc Kalb County , Alabama. ) 2 . The " mansion " had no columns . Like most of the other old farmhouses on Sand Mountain . it was a dogtrot log cabin with an ell at the back . The same practical pattern is still being used by builders throughout the South , but the dogtrot is now called a breezeway and the construction is n't as solid . The walls of that cabin were made of squared-off walnut logs , some of which must have been four feet thick , When I saw it a few years back , they looked good for at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for winter use . down in the valley , but it did n't have any columns either . ) S. The Yankees did n't ruin the place . Aside from stealing a fen fence rails for their campfires , they apparently behaved with decorum . The family was poor because the soil on Sand Mountain never was much good , the Tennessee River habitually flooded the better fields in the bottoms , and malaria was endemic . Contrary to legend , it was n't The War that forced such families to the West ; they just hoped to make a better living on free homestead land . For the Capertons . TVA came a century too late . ANOTHER favorite legend of my boyhood was that the war divided many families in the Tennessee River country , with the result that kinfolks met on the battlefield , usually at bayonet point . I now know that my two grandfathers must have been on opposite sides in at least two battles ? Shiloh and Donelson ? and probably at Fort Henry . But it is most unlikely that they ever got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battlefield Or elsewhere . Moral : The sure ' null ti lith may be stranger than fiction , but it does n't make as satisfying a story .
