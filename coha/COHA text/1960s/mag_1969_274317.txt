On those few occasions when people under 30 are not watching movies , they are probably off making them . At universities all over the country , gymnasiums have been converted into sound stages , classrooms into editing cubbies . Although most student efforts are not good enough for general distribution , an occasional film is given a limited commercial run . A current example is a feature called Who 's That Knocking at My Door ? , made over a period of two years at New York University by Martin Scorsese , 26 , a graduate student . The film 's several weaknesses and excesses prevent it from being totally successful . But it introduces a young director who just may turn out to be one of the brighter talents of this eager new generation . <P> Drawing heavily on his boyhood in an Italian neighborhood in New York City , Scorsese has constructed a loose narrative about a jobless adolescent named J.R . ( Harvey Keitel ) and a wispy , enigmatic girl ( Zina Bethune ) . J.R . moves in a world where Cadillacs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandchildren down to the corner for a lemon ice is the No. 1 professional murderer on the East Coast . <P> At parties , J.R . and his pals drink vino , play with revolvers and have a good time with " the broads . " While the others amuse themselves by talking tough and riding uptown to visit the whores , J.R . shyly courts his girl on rooftops and ferries . But he can not bring himself to violate his strict Catholic heritage by sleeping with her . When she confides to him that she was once raped , he rejects her and returns to life with his cronies on the street . <P> Unfortunately , that street and its milieu overshadow the relationships within . Trying to combat a basically melodramatic situation , Scorsese goes too far in the opposite direction . He diffuses the action badly , destroying a good deal of plot continuity , and overindulges in scenes with J.R . and his buddies that are of peripheral importance . The whole of the picture is less than the sum of its parts , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choreographs his camera movements with an exhilarating , easy grace , and his dramatic use of rock ' n ' roll ( the film 's title comes from a 1958 hit by the Genies ) surpasses similar efforts in The Graduate and Easy Rider . Such fragments are bright enough to make Who 's That Knocking-and more important , Martin Scorsese-worth watching .
