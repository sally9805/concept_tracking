New York City has the nation 's biggest school system-and one of the saddest . <P> What " inertia and apathy " portend for the city-and for the whole nation-was summed up last week by the Ford Foundation 's President Henry T. Heald , onetime ( 1952-56 ) chancellor of New York University , in an angry speech before New York City 's United Parents Associations . " What happens in the nation 's largest city makes its impact throughout the country . Educational neglect means aggravation of the conditions leading to irresponsibility and lawlessness among our youth , an increasing economic burden for social welfare , the perpetuation of islands of squalor amidst shining centers of commerce and culture . And what is most tragic of all , it means that the potential genius and greatness in some of the youth in New York will go largely undiscovered and undeveloped . " The answer , that poor and immigrant New Yorkers have always managed to rise , is no comfort to Veteran Educator Heald . " Their rise was often promoted by a developing , dedicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 19605 fare ? " By all evidence , not well . " An educational revolution is beginning to sweep the U.S. , " but New York schools can barely " keep a foothold on the status quo . " They are run by a politically appointed board of education , gripped in a " fiscal imprisonment " that plants city hall between the schools and state funds . The whole system is bogged down in a mire of " administrative inefficiency , political manipulation and official timidity . " And why should this be ? In essence : " The response of many of the most intelligent people of New York to the school problem has been to flee from it . Rather than stay and help do something about the schools , they resort to private schools or the suburbs . ' ' Yet " a first-rate school system is within the grasp of New York City . " The job begins with recovery of the purpose of the schools-education . It begins with " a drastic overhaul " of school administration - complete divorce from the city 's politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it begins with privileged citizens ' remembering that " it is your children who are being shortchanged.
