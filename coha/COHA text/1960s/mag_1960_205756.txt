( See Cover ) <P> Along the eight-lane highways that stretch forth like tentacles from San Francisco , it was the time of day that tries men 's carburetors : the evening rush hour . Everyone wanted to get home at once . Trapped in a snarling , bumper-to-bumper tie-up , Salesman Bink Beckmann reacted with unusual calm ; he had a unique way of keeping his blood pressure down . On a tiny slip of paper he scrawled , " Hold dinner ; traffic tie-up " ; then he reached behind him into a cage , seconds later sent a homing pigeon fluttering out of the car window . A pigeon fancier , Beckmann carries eight pigeons on his daily rides to and from work , keeps his waiting wife informed of delays with pigeon-powered bulletins to their San Rafael home . <P> On the other coast of the U.S. , deep in the tunneled bowels of Manhattan 's Grand Central Terminal , Publishing Executive Cal Estes boarded the New Haven railroad 's 5:11 to Riverside , Conn . From long experience with the New Haven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed the unhappy vision of a late train , of his wife preparing dinner without any warning that he would be late . There was one way to prepare for the worst . With an air of quiet desperation , he went to the bar car , began drinking Scotch on the rocks as the train pulled out . The drinks were not wasted . By the time the 5:11 got to Riverside , it was 40 minutes late on a scheduled 47-minute run . <P> Bicycles &; Kayaks . Beckmann and Estes are resourceful examples of a special and hardy breed of U.S. citizen : the commuter . Like the U.S. postman , the intrepid commuter lets neither howling storms , nor packed trains , nor jammed highways , nor endless delays keep him from the completion of his appointed rounds between work and home . He is willing to endure all the journey 's perils for the sake of pursuing success in the city and the good life-or cheaper living-in the suburbs or exurbs . <P> Out of a U.S. working force of 66 million , commuters make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to work accounts for a larger volume of passenger traffic than any other type of weekday travel . Six million of them get to work and back home by auto , 450,000 by train , 3,550,000 by bus , subway or rapid transit . Others ingeniously make the trip by airplane , helicopter , bicycle , motor scooter , powerboat and , in the case of one hardy California commuter , by kayak . <P> The great postwar exodus to Suburbia has scattered commuters through the U.S. countryside surrounding great cities , put a crippling strain on the arteries that feed the metropolises . A few foreign cities also have problems in handling the commuter torrent : London and Paris groan beneath its weight , Tokyo hires students to push commuters tightly into rush-hour trains , and Calcutta 's commuter rails are so crowded that people ride prone on the roofs of coaches . But in the U.S. , the nationwide flight to the suburbs has created a huge problem for almost every major city . And the problem is due to get worse .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
