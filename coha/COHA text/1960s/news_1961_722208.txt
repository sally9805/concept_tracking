txt Transit negotiations to avert a city-wide subway and bus strike New Year 's Day entered their customary last-week crisis phase yesterday . Michael J. Quill summoned members of his Transport Workers Union to a strike meeting tonight at Manhattan Center . Employes of the Transit Authority and seven private bus companies will be asked to authorize a walkout if there is no new agreement by the deadline . David L. Cole , chairman of the Transit Labor Board , said the bargainers were getting down to " brass tacks " on basic economic issues . Mr. Quill differed . The negotiations , he said . were " rapidly breaking down . " Joseph E. O'Grady , a member of the authority , put it another way . He said : " All I can say is that things certainly are not coming to a very happy conclusion at the moment . " Threat by Electricians Another labor dispute with a New Year 's Day strike deadline was no nearer settlement yesterday . It involves 9,000 members of Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on millions of dollars worth of construction projects unless it gets a four-hour day instead of the ' present six-hour schedule . Meanwhile , Mr. Quill served ! notice that if he had an agreement only with the authority-1 but not with the private lines ? by 12:01 A. M. next Monday the union would strike against both groups . At the moment the only negotiations under way are those between the union and the authority . The private lines , 1 which extended their expiring contracts from Dec. 1 to Jan. 1 with a pledge of retroactivity , are waiting for the current talks to set the pattern for their own settlement , as they usually do . 2 Bars to a Strike Transit observers were inclined to regard Mr. Quill 's allor-nothing threat as a pressure device . They noted that if the union reached agreement with the authority there would be two bars to such a strike against the agency . One would be the new contract itself . It would contain a no-strike pledge , enforceable either on an order from Theodore W. Kheel , impartial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by injunction . Such an order might even include a no-strike directive against the private lines . The other bar to the strike would be the state 's CondonWadlin Act . This measure forbids stoppages by Government employes on pain of severe reprisal . Employes of the authority have city civil-service status and come under the law . With the strike deadline now only five days away , the possibility of a recommendation for settlement from the Transit Labor Board was increased . The board was set up last year by Mayor Wagner as a " new approach " to transit labor relations , with the specific objective of avoiding last-minute crisis settlements . Under ita original ground rules , which have not been closely followed , the board was to have made its recommendations by Dec. 23 . It did not do so . If the union and the authority remain bogged down ? especially over the T. W. U. demand for a four-day , thirtytwo-hour week  --  the board may propose settlement terms , not binding on either side , before New Year 's Eve . Quill Stand Questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for the shorter work week . But persons close to the bargaining suggested that if he could obtain a substantial money package that did not include a cut in hours , he might welcome a recommendation from the board against the thirtytwo-hour week as a way of getting " off the hook . " The union leader , who has asked for a 15 per cent wage increase and other benefits , indicated that the ; 35,000,000 settlement with the authority two years ago would not be adequate this year . He called the 1959 contract a " bad deal " and " small potatoes . " Two years ago he described the agreement as one of the best in union history . Mayor Wagner confirmed that that the city was considering a plan to lease the Fifth Avenue Coach Lines and its subsidiary , Surface Transit , Inc. , and then hire the present management to operate the city 's two biggest bus lines . He said that the city , not the companies , had originated the idea , and that details were still under discussion . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which expect to lose $800,000 this year , to meet the : osts of a higher wage bill . In addition it would permit the city : o make good on its pledge to ; seep the 15-cent fare . The Mayor acknowledged in reply to questions at a City Hall sews conference that the plan would be a subsidy to the corn ) anies borne by the taxpayers . tie pointed out that taxpayers already were subsidizing the 15-lent fare for Transit Authority rides . But he said cheap transportation was good for the city and it was a help to the city 's economy . He repeated a previous pledge to keep the present fare as long as possible . The Board of Estimate sets the fare for the private lines . The authority controls its own fare . The Fifth Avenue - Surface organization would prefer a higher fare to the lease-management plan . This morning subcommittees for the authority , the T. W.
