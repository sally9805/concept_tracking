txt Governor Rockefeller yester ? day bluntly put the blame for the rupture of friendly citystate relationships on Mayor Wagner and city representatives in the Legislature . He accused the Mayor of mis ? representation , tinged with " au. dacity , " in saying that city fiscal needs had been ignored in the state budget . In fact , he asserted , city demands were submitted " two days after my budget had gone to print . " Hinting broadly at boss control , the Governor said that agreements he had reached with the Mayor somehow had not been " translated into action in support of these programs by the city 's legislative representatives and those who control these legislators . " Last-Minute Shift Cited " I do n't know who controls them , " he said . " But all I know is that they can make speeches and take positions up to the time of the vote and then the whole group can go the other direction . " He cited how " a phone call from New York City " had induced Democrats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had helped prepare and had been supporting . He said that every Democrat had voted against last year 's increase in the gasoline tax , which W. Averell Harriman , his Democratic predecessor as Governor , had favored . " If anyone is shortchanging the city for political purposes , " Mr. Rockefeller said , " it 's the city 's own representatives in Albany who are playing pol - tics with this thing . " These were among the Governor 's comments on the WRCATV program , Citizens Union " Searchlight . " Immediately before that show , he appeared on the same station 's " Direct Line " program . Thus for a full hour he was answering questions either from the studio or his listening audience . " I think there 's a political smokescreen that is put out about city-state relationships , " he said , " in which all those who come from this area in the Democratic party participate * * * to confuse the public on the real facts of the issues and the problems which are faced down here . " He cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the Federal telephone tax available to the localities . He noted that the tax , estimated at $70 , - 000,000 for the state , would mean $40,000,000 for New York City alone . He said he found this Democratic opposition " incomprehensible " because if the state voted the tax and distributed it under the equalization formula , New York City would get only $20,000,000 . Tax Now Up to Congress The telephone tax is scheduled to die this year , but President Eisenhower has asked Congress to renew it . If Congress does not , it would then be possible for states to take it over . Governor Rockefeller has proposed that New York use the tax for schools , if the Federal Government relinquishes it . The Governor drew his picture against the background of Mayor Wagner 's assertion that the city needed $36,000,000 more for education . In answer to a question , the Governor said he could only conclude that the whole performance was in " in the sole interest of embarrassing " him . " And I think it is at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . Other points made by the Governor during the hour of questioning were these : fusion ticket in the 1961 mayoralty election " would be a very healthy thing , if it can give greater emphasis to twoparty government . " He pictured the Liberal and Republican parties joining forces to obtain that balance . He said scandals in the city showed the need to " get people of ability , courage , vision and integrity into government . " 41He confirmed that he would be speaking widely across the nation , particularly after the Legislature adjourns late in March , " on issues I think of fundamental concern today . " He sidestepped efforts to make him restate more definitely his earlier withdrawal as a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination . He laughed off the possibility of a draft or of running as the Democratic nominee . ( lHe still was against offtrack betting , the Governor said later , but he saw merit while on the air in a suggestion that the question be submitted to the voters in a referendum . He said this was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money from families " who need it most . " glie attacked Mayor Wagner 's contention that the city was " only getting 34 cents out of every dollar of state aid . " He maintained that it got 40 cents , which he deemed reasonable in view of the fact the city only had a third of the state 's school children . He stressed that , apart from school aid where the city percentage dropped to 28 or 29 per cent , the city got a large portion of aid . He said it got 81 per cent of housing subsidies , 65 per cent of health aid , 64 per cent of welfare payments and 54 per cent of general local assistance . ( Me maintained that Controller Arthur Levitt 's higher estimates notwithstanding , the state surplus was just $32,000,000 and " certainly will not justify a tax cut . " He said the state had a " tremendous number of problems to take care of , " including the doubling of college facilities by 1970 . Levitt Interviewed Controller Levitt. a Democrat , was interviewed yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He contended the surplus was " substantially more " than the Governor said because the Governor had set up a $50,000,000 reserve fund for persons claiming income tax refunds . Mr. Levitt maintained such claims would he offset by taxpayers owing the state money . This is the first year of state withholding , and there is no actual experience to support either view . The Governor said on the " Direct Line " broadcast , where telephoned questions were gathered by League of Women Voters ' workers , that he had not moved to implement proposals to change the - status of the Controller and Attorney General because he thought the proposals needed study . " This is a very important and delicate subject that should be debated and discussed by the people , " he said . Lefkowitz Consulted Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz , who is a Republican , spoke yesterday on the WCBS radio program " Let 's Find Out . " He said that like Mr. Levitt he had been consulted by the Governor and his aides on the proposal that their offices be made appointive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I disagree with them personally , " he said . On this program , Mr. Lefkowitz conceded that he had discussed with his family the possibility of running for Mayor here in 1961 but that he really had not " even started to think about it .
