The middle road is a difficult political path to follow , especially in Latin America , and Brazil 's President Joao ( " Jango " ) Goulart may yet veer back into the leftist demagoguery that gave him his start as a labor leader . But last week he showed that he means what he says about fiscal stability , economic austerity , and a fair shake for foreign investors . At the same time , as an astute politician , he remembered his vows to the nationalists who have long been his supporters . <P> To attack Brazil 's roaring inflation , Goulart raised the required reserves of private banks from 14% to 22% of deposits . The move should cut the amount of currency in circulation , by tightening the amount available for loans . Next , Goulart went after Brazil 's sorely unbalanced trade ( last year 's deficit : $67 million ) , increasing the rate of exchange from 310 cruzeiros to the dollar to 350 for buying , and from 318 to 359.30 for selling . This should encourage exports and make imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clamor from all sides to nationalize major foreign-owned utility companies . But he made it clear that he intends to give fair value for the properties . Since World War II , increased expenses and government-set rates have caught the U.S. and Canadian companies that run Brazil 's telephone and power plants in a profit squeeze that has kept them from needed expansion . Canada 's $1 billion Brazilian Traction , Light &; Power Co . Ltd. , which owns 82% of Brazil 's 956,000 telephones and one-third of the installed power capacity , has been making only 1% to 2% on its investment . It says it can do nothing about the complaint that some 300,000 citizens of Rio de Janeiro have been waiting as long as ten years for a phone . <P> On his trip to the U.S. two months ago , Goulart got President Kennedy 's general agreement to a plan under which the utilities would be nationalized for fair value . Brazilian Traction agreed . So did American &; Foreign Power Co . Inc. , whose eleven subsidiaries , worth $250 million , produce 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which recently lost a telephone system to Rio Grande do Sul 's Leftist Governor Leonel Brizola and is still trying to collect , was noncommittal . But Goulart 's decree last week should do something to ease I.T . &; T. 's pain . The government promises a down payment of 10% , with the rest to be repaid on a long-term basis provided the company agrees to reinvest at least 75% of the total in Brazil .
