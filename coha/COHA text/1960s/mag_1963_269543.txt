Olle and Barbro Stahl live in Stockholm 's working-class Stora Essingen District . Every morning Olle , 32 , kisses Barbro goodbye at the door of their flat and drives his Volkswagen to the city 's Vantor parish church , where he is a curate . Barbro , 30 , spends an hour or so with her son Krister and then goes across her garden to the Essinge parish church , where she is assistant pastor . <P> " Let your women keep silence in the churches , " enjoined St. Paul , and Christian tradition is strongly on the side of an all-male clergy . Outside Orthodoxy , the Anglican Communion and Roman Catholicism , however , the desperate need for clergy has given many churchmen cause to think twice about the validity of custom . Now at least 50 of the 168 churches belonging to the World Council of Churches admit women to the ministry . Barbro is the fifth of seven women to be elevated by the Swedish state Church to the Lutheran priesthood since Parliament authorized such an appointment in 1959 . <P> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went on to study theology together at the university there . They were married before receiving their degrees in 1958 , and she worked as a secretary in a parish house before the legal change cleared the way for her ordination . Her clerical duties are long and tiring . Lutheran ministers in Sweden are also civil servants , responsible for recording all births , marriages and deaths . She has visits from parishioners in search of spiritual help , spends most of her evenings on youth work or speaking to women 's organizations . Barbro also teaches Sunday school and every other week officiates at the parish Communion service . <P> There is still plenty of opposition to women ministers in Sweden , and last week ' Barbro was refused permission to preach in the cathedral of Linkoping . Another handicap is her tranquil good looks . " This is not a suitable attribute for a priest , " thundered one church magazine after her ordination . " Her beauty might awaken wrong feelings in male parishioners . " <P> Barbro , on the other hand , finds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people , especially girls , " who are able to talk to me about things they could not tell a male priest . " Barbro is well liked by her parishioners who seem to share her contempt for the Pauline shibboleth . " The time we live in " she says , " requires that both men and women help carry out and spread the teachings of Christ . Tradition is to help people , and not to bind them . "
