THE ECONOMY <P> Either transit fares or real estate taxes seem sure to go up in San Francisco because of the costly settlement that ended New York City 's twelve-day transit strike . Transit wages in the Golden Gate city are tied by contract formula to those in New York , highest in the nation . As a result , San Francisco 's transit wage bill could rise by $572,000 a year next July 1 and by another $1,600,000 a year in 1967 . Meeting that cost would require a 100 rise in realty taxes , from today 's rate of $10.17 per $100 of valuation-or else an end to San Francisco 's 15 fare . <P> Because the strike half-paralyzed <P> New York City , the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. and headquarters for more of the world 's commerce than any other business center , its ripples quickly spread across the nation , affecting thousands of businessmen and , potentially , millions of their customers . Banks and securities dealers from Chicago to Dallas ran into snags that curtailed check clearing and stock trading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped as much as 15% on railroads along the Boston-Washington axis . <P> Home in Frustration . Retailers everywhere in the U.S. still face the probability of late deliveries-perhaps even sales-losing shortages-of Easter finery . Reason : at least 125,000 New York garment workers were unable to reach their cutting tables and sewing machines at the height of the seasonal production rush . Some buyers in town for spring-fashion showings went home in frustration ; others turned to the growing garment centers in Dallas and Los Angeles . Eastern buyers , many there for the first time , helped swell the attendance by 33% at California Market Week in Los Angeles . In Denver , one store canceled newspaper ads because promised shipments of dresses failed to arrive . <P> Inside New York , estimates of strike-caused loss ranged from $500 million ( Mayor Lindsay ) to $800 million ( the Commerce &; Industry Association ) . The association figured that wage earners lost $187.5 million in pay for 75 million unworked man-hours-a blow that fell most heavily on the poor . Said Executive Vice President Ralph C. Gross : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since the Depression . " <P> Retailers suffered a $320 million loss in sales . Only 35% of the sales force showed up in most department stores - but that did n't matter , since customers stayed away in vastly greater numbers . Department-store sales during the first week of the strike fell 41% behind the level of the same week in 1965 ; but a mere ten miles away , in strike-free Newark , sales gained 14% . In New York City , some small shops were hit hardest of all . Most furniture and liquor stores did only half their normal business ; jewelers and camera and hardware stores reported sales declines of as much as 80% . To recover , many Manhattan stores scheduled post-strike sales . " Most businesses , " predicted Macy 's president , David L. Yunich , " wo n't be able to recoup their losses . "
