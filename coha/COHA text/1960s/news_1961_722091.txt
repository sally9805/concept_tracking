txt Governor Rockefeller offered a program yesterday to provide middle-income housing for 1,000,000 persons in 250,000 families here within ten years . He called for the construction of ; 4,750,000,000 M such housing by using the air rights above publicly owned , untaxed tunnel entrances , piers , highways , schools and storage tracks . While the concept is not new , the Governor 's plan is considered the most massive and most detailed yet suggested for utilizing these air rights . And Mr. Rockefeller made it clear that the plan as announced was his alone . Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz , the Republican candidate for Mayor , who is to make a major housing statement today , was not told in advance of the contents of the plan , the Governor said . Nor were city // officials , such as Mayor Wagner or Planning Commission Chairman James Felt , upon whom the success of the program would depend , Mr. Rockefeller said . The middle-income housing that would be provided by the Governor 's proposal would be constructed by private enterprise with the assistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rockefeller said the use of air right above city-owned property would mean : ' Properties that are now taxexempt can be put onto the tax rolls to yield the city millions in new revenue . " No existing dwellings will have to be torn down to make room for these new units . The new housing will be a complete gain in our supply of housing . " Good urban living can be supplied for nearly a million persons at rentals averaging $29 a room or less . " The Governor made his proposal at a news conference at the St. Regis Hotel . He said the program had been devised in a five-month study by his five-member Committee for Urban Middle-Income Housing . 208 Sites Found So Far A city-wide survey by the committee brought to light 208 existing public facilities above which new dwellings could be built , Mr. Rockefeller said , and further surveys would at least double the number of sites . In addition , housing could be constructed above future schools and other public facilities . Governor Rockefeller said that at the start he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on building each year for ten years apart ment units for 25,000 families , or about 100,000 persons , at an estimated cost of $475,000,000 a year . The financing would be done under the state 's Limited Profit Housing Companies Act . This authorizes the state to provide private developers with 90 per cent of the mortgages at low interest for forty years . It also authorizes the city to grant tax abatements up to 50 per cent for thirty years . The sponsors , who put up 10 per cent of the project cost , agree to limit their profits to 6 per cent . On each 25,000 housing units built above tax-exempt sites the city could expect to collect $7,500,000 a year in taxes . This would be increased considerably , after the tax abatement expired at the end of thirty years . The State Housing Finance Agency already has almost $400,000,000 available in loan funds for such projects , the Governor said , and this could be increased by the sale of bonds as more money would be needed . " The shortage of middle-in- ' come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major , cause of the blight and deterioration of the city , " the I Governor said . He chided the Wagner administration for not having a " clearly defined policy " on tax abatement . Similar Proposal by Mayor In 1959 Mayor Wagner made a similar proposal to use air rights above public buildings for new construction , but very little ever came of it . More recently the Board of Education said it was studying ! the possibility of building a cum-I bination commercial high school , and skyscraper office building ; in mid-Manhattan . A rental housing project is i being built as part of the new George Washington Bridge approach , and a cooperative is being built above the New York Central 's switching yards at Mott Haven . Mayor Wagner was not immediately available for comment last night . Mr. Lefkowitz , when he learned of the program , praised it as " bold and imaginative . " Mr. Felt said he could not endorse or oppose the proposal until he studied it .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
