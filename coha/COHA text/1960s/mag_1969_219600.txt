" When the legend becomes fact , " says the canny newspaper editor in John Ford 's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , " print the legend . " Sam Peckinpah is a film maker dedicated to telling truths and still preserving the legend of the American West . In feature films ( Ride the High Country , Major Dundee ) and television shows ( The Westerner ) , his characters are eminently fallible , their deeds frequently inglorious . They are legends both because and in spite of themselves . The Wild Bunch is Peckinpah 's most complex inquiry into the metamorphosis of man into myth . Not incidentally , it is also a raucous , violent , powerful feat of American film making . <P> One Good Score . The script-which Peckinpah wrote with Walon Green - has the sound and rhythm of a rambling campfire yarn . Pike Bishop ( William Holden ) is the aging leader of a ragtag bunch of bandits who ride through the Southwest trying to scrape together an honorably illegal living . The money from previous jobs has just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of murderous bounty hunters . After an unsuccessful stickup in which two of them are killed , the rest light out for Mexico , with the bounty hunters hard on their trail , looking to make what Bishop calls " one good score . " <P> The score turns out to be a crazy scheme to steal a U.S. armaments shipment for a freebooting Mexican general named Mapache , a slow-witted executioner fighting a losing battle against <P> Pancho Villa 's army . " We share very few sentiments with our government , " Bishop explains lightly as his men prepare to take the required rifles from a U.S. Army supply train . In 1913 , this sort of activity is already anachronistic and doomed to failure . Trying to fulfill the terms of the contract , the bunch get doublecrossed . At the same time , they are caught in the vise of their own simplistic code of honor ( " When you side with a man , you stay with him , " Bishop says ) . Mapache betrays them from one side while the bounty hunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the bloodiest battle ever put on film . <P> Individual Horror . " Listen , " Peckinpah says , " killing is no fun . I was trying to show what the hell it 's like to get shot . " Using a combination of fast cutting and slow motion , Peckinpah creates scenes of uncontrolled frenzy in which the feeling of chaotic violence is almost overwhelming . Where the slow-motion murders in Bonnie and Clyde were balletic , similar scenes in The Wild Bunch have the agonizing effect of prolonging the moment of impact , giving each death its own individual horror . Peckinpah repeatedly suggests that the true victims of violence are the young . Children watch the scenes of brutality and carnage wide-eyed , with little fear ; a Mexican mother nurses her child by holding her bandolier aside , the baby 's tiny fists pressed up against the cartridges . Finally , with mounting excitement , one boy gets to participate in his first fight-and excitedly shoots Pike Bishop in the back .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
