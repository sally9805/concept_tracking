For Robert Francis Kennedy the pain has just begun to subside . His wiry frame is still pounds lighter than it was last November , and for the first time gray is clearly visible in the thick thatch of light-brown hair . Around his eyes , too , there are bleak lines of grief that make the familiar diminutive " Bobby " seem inappropriate . Since that dreadful day in Dallas there have been other changes . The restless drive that was always so much a part of his style has eased perceptibly , and he has grown far more reflective . In his thoughts and his talk there is a new quality of detached deliberation . Time no longer seems to have quite the same urgency for him . The deepest difference , however , is something beyond manner or appearance . During most or his adult years he planned his life almost entirely in terms of service to his brother , the late President . " Bobby has always sacrificed himself for Jack , " an old friend observed shortly after he had reluctantly accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be diplomatic , ? ? bile Bobby was the tough guy who came along afterwards , laying down organizational law and saying no when it had to be said . I think taking this job was a hard personal decision for him . In a way , it vas a turning point in his career . I know he would have liked to run for office on his own . I hope What next for R.F.K. ? he still does , but 1 wonder if he ever will . " That was a little more than three years ago . Now , because of an assassin 's bullet , everything has changed . The 38-year-old Kennedy , once the President 's most important confidante and the second most powerful man in Washington , has to reassemble his life along new lines  --  in terms of his own wants and needs , of his duty as a husband and father , his role as the new head of a family marked by triumph and tragedy , his responsibility to what his older brother began and could not complete . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of the course his life will finally take . " My only interest was to be a good Attorney General and to help the President , " he said recently . " That was the easy way out for me , I grant . It was simple . Now it 's much more complex . For six weeks after my brother 's death I thought about it , and I did n't come to any conclusion , so I decided to stop thinking about it for a while and just finish out my term as Attorney General . " Few people realize how close he came to withdrawing completely from public life in the weeks that followed his brother 's death . At first he was in a state of shock . Later he seemed to live on nerve alone . Then he fell into desolation and despair , and friends tried in vain to divert him . Finally he started coming out of it on his own . There was a particularly poignant moment just before Christmas at a party for a Washington orphanage . A little boy approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone froze . The boy , realizing he had said something wrong , was close to tears , but Bob picked him up and reassured him . " That 's all right , " he said softly . " I have another . " By the end of the year he could even manage a wan wisecrack . When a visitor told him he was glad to hear that Bob had decided to take a week off to go skiing in Colorado , he said , " You 're the ninth person to tell me that today . What 's everybody plotting here , a palace coup ? " Today , an enormous amount of speculation is focused on Robert Kennedy 's future . Polls proclaim him favorite vice-presidential candidate among the Democratic rank-and-file . Politicians in a steady stream have privately urged him to commit himself ; son-le have already publicly endorsed him . When he is asked about this directly , the political realist in him can not resist the wry retort : " It 's really Lyndon Johnson 's decision , do n't you think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Kennedy was No.2 man in the Administration , and they still are not . Theirs is a wary relationship , not unfriendly but formal , with each being careful not to force himself on the other . Those closest to Kennedy believe that if President Johnson does pick a member of the Kennedy family as his running mated will be brother-in-law Sargent Shrivel ' . What Bob can not now say is what he would do if the vice-presidential nomination were offered to him . He is not being coy . When he has an answer to a question , he does not hesitate to give it . For example , he flatly denies the report that he plans to move to New York next year to launch an elective career there . As far as politics are concerned , " he says , " the only alternative to staying in Washington is returning to Massachusetts . Otherwise I do n't know whether I want to travel for a while or teach . " " Everybody talks about him as if he were n't human , " one of Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't have a wife and eight kids that maybe he ought to be spending a hell of a lot more time with , as if he did n't have thoughts and feelings of his own , as if he did n't have the right to sit back now and ask how all of this affects me . " Still , it is obvious that he could not turn his back on the memory of John F. Kennedy even if he wanted to . It was as the late President 's brother , not as Attorney General , that he undertook a diplomatic mission to Asia in January , for example . And when some 10.000 Japanese students greeted him with cheers , he told them , ' ' There was a special feeling between President Kennedy and young people . He was more than just the President of a country . He was the leader of young people everywhere . What he was trying to do was to fight for peace and also to light against hunger , disease and poverty around the world . You and I as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight ! " A vicarious tribute In Manila he spoke to another student group  --  one that John Kennedy would have addressed if he had lived to tour the Far East this past winter . After the Attorney General had finished speaking , the cheering students mobbed him . When he finally got into his car , his eyes welled with tears . " It was n't really for me , " he said . " It was for him . " A friend seated beside him quietly replied , " You 've got to do it for him now . " For perhaps 30 seconds Bob Kennedy sat there lost in thought . Then he slowly nodded his head in agreement . The idea of sending him to Asia originated with McGeorge Bundy , President Kennedy 's special assistant on national-security matters , who had stayed on at Lyndon Johnson 's request . For months Bundy had watched with increasing concern the bitter conflict between President Sukarno of Indonesia and the British-backed Malaysian Federation . Sukarno was organizing guerrilla warfare to " liberate " northern Borneo from Malaysian rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since large-scale fighting could easily involve the United States , Bundy felt Washington should send someone to try to halt hostilities . He suggested Bob Kennedy for two reasons . First , the Attorney General 's trip to the Far East two years before had been exceptionally successful , especially In establishing friendly relations with Sukarno . Bundy also was eager to get Robert Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson working purposefully together . Bob Kennedy was under no illusions about the mission . Even if he were successful in bringing about at least a ternPorary settlement , it would count for little to a U.S. public far more concerned with more immediately dramatic events . If he were unsuccessful , his critics would immediately leap on the failure as proof of his inability to operate without the backing of a brother in the White House . He had barely taken off , accompanied by his wife Ethel , before diplomatic circles snilTed that he would accomplish nothing . As it happened , he turned in a highly effective performance . He walked into a situation in which both sides had stopped talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it could win . When he walked out , he had secured  --  at least for the time being  --  the cease-fire he was after , as well as a promise to work out differences around the conference table . " Bobby did far more than anyone believed possible , " says a member of the national security staff . " It was his idea to concentrate on a cease-fire as the first step , with neutral Thailand policing it . He also kept everybody off balance with his disarming directness . He kept everything out in the open . For instance , he told the Malaysians that Sukarno thought they were simply puppets being manipulated by the British to humiliate him . At the same time he told Sukarno that the Malaysians considered him a kind of Asian Hitler bent on expansion . He then made it perfectly plain that if war was what everyone wanted , it was what they were going to get . But his theme was always the same : Let 's see if there is n't some solution besides war . If the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The trip , which took him around the world in 13 days , did much to mend his spirit . It also restored a great deal of the laconic humor , largely hidden from the public view , that had always laced his private conversation . For example , in Korea , where he spent a night and a day visiting front-line troops , he was briefed by an Army general . A little later , puffing on a cigar , he remarked to a companion , " I do n't want to worry you . But you remember that general who explained how we would handle the North Koreans if they attacked ? Well , the last time I saw him was two years ago in Berlin when he told us what we would do if the Russians ever moved in on us there . The only other time 1 saw him was when he was holding a briefing on the Bay of Pigs operation . " Even the acid comments of the British press failed to ruffle him . Since Britain was backing Malaysia , scarcely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold out to Sukarno in one way or another . Landing in England on his way back to Washington , he was met by a phalanx of reporters and photographers at London Airport . Standing in the door of the plane , he pointed toward them and said , " Suppose I get off carrying a sign that says , 1 just sold Singapore and I 'm glad ! ' " But , although the ability to laugh at life has returned , the past is never far away for Bob Kennedy . The hurt has simply been buried a little deeper . Spare moments are still not spent in relaxing but in reading and answering more of the telegrams and letters of condolence in his briefcase As the plane headed home . Ethel Kennedy quietly said . " This is the worst part . To go back to Washington now and not to find Jack waiting for him . " The time of the New Frontier is still too close for Bob to talk about it easily . He will start to say something , then his voice retreats into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together , " he will say , trying to assess his brother 's Administration . " I suppose the Cuban missile crisis was the single most important moment . But that was not all of it . . . " and his voice fades away . " He brought a new spirit to the land , " he will begin again . " He made politics something that a young person wanted to get into ... " and again he lapses into silence . Weighing it all together , he says , " What we did did n't always turn out to be the right thing , but we tried . I 'm selfish enough to think that in the long run we will he supported by history . " After his return from the Far East , Kennedy picked up the reins of the Justice Department , which had largely been hanled by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas deB . Katienhach . Up from the Civil Rights Division came a map of the United States , its southern portion spotted with pins marking the places where the Justice Department had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Criminal Division quickly found out that Kennedy had n't forgotten about Cosa Nostra . The second night after he had returned , Criminal Division chief Herbert Miller received a call at home at 10 PAL It was the Attorney General wanting to know about an investigation in the Chicago area . Miller was delighted . " It meant , " he says , " that Bob was hack in business . " Kennedy also kept an interested eye on the James HotTa trial in Tennessee . Naturally he was pleased that the Teamster boss was convicted but , he snorts , " It 's ridiculous to say I was after Hoffa per ally . What I was after was the conspi of power he represented . " He also en a round of conferences regarding his a trust program . " We should have g on it earlier , " he says . " But we 've sta now and I think we 'll improve . " Civil rights remains his chief concern Attorney General , however . Recently visitor reminded him of a conversati three years ago in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the problem settled . " I still believe that reason and ra tionality will prevail , " he said now , " es cept in Alabama and Mississippi . I also still feel that in the North there is far too much hypocrisy from people who pref talking about integration to actually liv ing it . 1 think that we 're going to have a lot of problems and bloodshed  --  after a it is a revolution  --  but in the end I think we will get through it . " He paused , thinking back . On the wall opposite him hung a painting that used to be in the White House , a portrait of his brother Joe , who was killed in action during World War II . On his desk are pair of miniature brass cannons , ma into bookends. that used to be on the d of his brother Jack . ' There were ma indications , " he went on , " that the Pr ident 's position in support of civil rights that he was going too fast  --  was going to cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any question of his being reelected . We used to talk about this and would say , ' What the hell . If we 're going to lose , let 's lose on principle . ' The point is that we really did not have any choice ' it was so clearly the correct thing to do . When he speaks of " the President , " he means John Fitzgerald Kennedy ; other wise it is " President Johnson . " What no lies ahead for Robert Kennedy depends to a large extent on the sort of relationship that he and Lyndon Johnson develop in the next five months . But Bob also remains a powerful political figure in his own right , the chief architect of the machinery that helped bring his brother to the White House in 1960 . If he does decide to stay in public life  --  and most of h friends think that he will  --  there are th conceivable paths for him to take . One is for him to continue in government as an appointed official . To his most fervent supporters this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wan to sec Bob run for the presidency so day , " a friend explains . " If he accepted another job , no matter how important , that %vould be the end of it . He has to get into the elective side of government " The second possible path is the vi presidency , assuming it is offered to hint . Kennedy recognizes this as within t realm of possibility and will now say only that he has an " open mind " about But under no circumstances would campaign for the position . The third path  --  and Kennedy 's likely course  --  is to break clean and an elective career by running for the go ernorship of Massachusetts two y hence . There is little doubt today that is what he would prefer to do . Only one thing is truly certain a Bob Kennedy 's future , however . As himself observed one recent evening , will never be able to " commit myself any individual again . "
