On a clear day , people in Costa Rica 's capital of San Jos used to enjoy the view of the dormant , 11,260-ft. volcano Iraz , 16 miles to the northeast . But dormant volcanoes , like " unloaded " guns , can be full of nasty surprises . Last March a violent explosion deep inside Iraz threw up a shower of rocks , some weighing as much as two tons .
