THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG-DISTANCE RUNNER ( 176 pp. ) - Alan Sillitoe - Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> I was told , continued Egremont , " that an impassable gulf divided the Rich from the Poor ; I was told that the Privileged and the People formed Two Nations , governed by different laws , influenced by different manners , with no thoughts or sympathies in common " <P> - Benjamin Disraeli : Sybil <P> Disraeli 's truism about England 's " two nations " appeared in 1845 , nearly a quarter of a century before he became Prime Minister . Today , despite the leveling influences of repeated wars and the advent of the welfare state , the two nations still eye each other across a gulf nearly as impassable . In Alan Sillitoe , the largely silent second nation has found a brilliantly articulate spokesman . His people , rattling around in the urban slums of the English Midlands , have nothing in common with the world image of the Englishman : tall , stolid , well-spoken with a reverence for fair play and the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in his novel , Saturday Night and Sunday Morning , Sillitoe 's characters are spry , gamy , wry-humored , and view the British policeman not as a kindly bobby but as " a dirty , bullying , jumped-up bastard . " <P> Son of a Nottingham tanner , 31-year-old Author Sillitoe left school at 14 to work in factories , turned to writing during the war while serving as an R.A.F. radio operator in Malaya . Far from being one of Britain 's heavily intellectual Angry Young Men , Sillitoe is extremely matter of fact in his recital of the war between the two nations . The blokes he writes about may have been " put inside " for anything from arson to stealing cars , from burglary to grabbing passing women and " trying to give them what-for . " <P> In the long title story , the battle lines are swiftly drawn . Smith , the 17-year-old narrator , is serving a stretch in a Borstal Institution for juvenile delinquents ( his offense : stealing 150 from a bakery ) . Encouraged by the hearty , sports-loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates , Smith lets down his high-minded sponsor by deliberately quitting in the stretch . Why ? Because Smith knows " it 's war between me and them , " and has no intention of giving aid and comfort to the enemy . <P> Many of the other stories point the same moral , and yet Author Sillitoe is almost never bitter , self-pitying or sentimental . Most of his people are buoyed by a bottomless optimism . As Smith puts it , talking about the warden : " It 's dead blokes like him as have the whiphand over blokes like me , and I 'm almost dead sure it always will be that way , but even so , by Christ , I 'd rather be like I am-always on the run and breaking into shops for a packet of fags and a jar of jam-than have the whiphand over someone else and be dead from the toenails up .
