Behind the Iron Curtain , the third anniversary of Fidel Castro 's victory was greeted with a flood of congratulatory telegrams-including " many requests " from Russian parents for permission to name newborn offspring ( Fidel ) . In Havana , Castro led into the anniversary with another of those speeches bragging about how cleverly he had concealed his Communism in the early days . " If , while we were in the Sierra Maestra , we had said , ' We are Marxist-Leninists , ' it is possible that we would never have been able to descend to the lowlands . " But among the other nations of the hemisphere , Castro 's third anniversary was a reminder of a decision to be made at the Jan. 22 meeting at Punta del Este , Uruguay , on the problem of what to do about Communist-dominated Cuba . <P> Castro 's own braggadocio has somewhat brightened the chances of a joint stand against him at Punta del Este . Before he made his boast , such pivotal Latin American leaders as Argentina 's President Arturo Frondizi were dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week , at Palm Beach on his way home from a world tour , Frondizi wound up 1 hours of talk with President Kennedy with an agreement that some action should come out of the Uruguay conference . <P> Frondizi is still opposed to such anti-Castro steps as diplomatic and economic sanctions . His argument is that sanctions would play into Castro 's hands by dividing the hemisphere into two debating camps : the seven nations that still maintain contact with Cuba v. the 13 that have broken relations. * As an alternative , Frondizi presented Kennedy with a new version of an idea proposed by Venezuela 's President Rmulo Betancourt . Instead of flatly condemning Cuba or Castro by name , each country would be asked to sign a declaration that would set standards-e.g. , a freely elected representative government , total respect for human rights - for membership in the community of American nations . Castro 's dictatorship could not and would not qualify , and could thus be ostracized . <P> Frigid Visage . What happens next-whether Cuba will be blackballed from the OAS , or isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild and tentative stand was apparently worrisome to Castro . He sent his Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Olivares Snchez flying through Latin America in an attempt to forestall any action at all at Punta del Este . <P> In Uruguay , Olivares told Chief of State Eduardo Victor Haedo that Cuba hoped that her right of " self-determination " ( even without elections ) would be respected at Punta del Este . Olivares de livered his message to Chile , then landed in Buenos Aires to see Frondizi . Castro 's messenger was bluntly told that Frondizi was " too busy . " After an hour with the Argentine Foreign Minister , Olivares marched out frozen-faced and silent . Shortly after the meeting , the Argentine Foreign Office released a pointed com muniqu repudiating Communism and ex pressing " enthusiastic support " for President Kennedy 's Alliance for Progress . <P>
