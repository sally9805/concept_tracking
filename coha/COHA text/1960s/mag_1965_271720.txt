British European Airways Trident Flight 343 approached London Airport one afternoon last week on a regular run from Paris . Captain Eric Poole sat in the cockpit , and the 80 passengers fastened their seat belts for the landing . The plane settled easily into the final approach and made a perfect touch down . But it was by no means a routine landing . As the plane taxied off the run way , Captain Poole got on the intercom to give his unsuspecting passengers a bit of a jolt : " Ladies and gentlemen , " he said , " the approach to the runway and the touchdown have been made by automatic equipment on board . " It was the first time that a jetliner with farepaying passengers aboard had landed by means of a computer . <P> The computer-operated landing system aboard the Trident is called the Autoflare , developed by Smith 's Aircraft Instruments and Hawker Siddeley Aviation . Autoflare takes over within 150 ft. of the ground ( see diagram ) . The plane is brought down the glide path toward the runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . From 150 ft. to 65 ft. , twin computers aboard take control , directing the descent with information they have memorized and stored during the preceding 15 sec . At 65 ft. , radio altimeters on board switch in . Now they signal the computers , which then bring the plane down to the proper landing point on the runway . The human pilot merely controls the plane 's roll and yaw . Only at touchdown does he push a button on the steering column to disengage the automatic system . <P> Though pilots have made Autoflare test landings with their windows blacked out , the system at first will be used in regular commercial traffic only when the ceiling is at least 300 ft . As another safety precaution , the two computers are hooked up so that if they disagree or malfunction they will automatically cut off , enabling the human pilot to take charge . In the U.S. , the only fully automatic landing system certified as airworthy by the Federal Aviation Agency is one developed by Boeing and the Bendix Corp. , but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . London Airport is fogged in at least a dozen full days each winter , and some days the pea soup is so thick that even a taxiing plane gets lost on the field .
