With little fanfare , the NAACP and the State of Massachusetts are moving down separate but similar paths to end the legal right of affluent suburban communities to preserve themselves as wealthy , white commuter bastions . At issue are the so-called " snob zoning " provisions of local home-rule statutes . Under these laws local town fathers can insure their com ? community 's insularity by laying out a grid of large-lot , single-family plots on all available land . The restric ? tions keep the poor bottled up in the cities , while the jobs move out to the closed-off suburbs . New job openings in the New York City metropoli ? tan area between 1952 and 1966 , for example , ran 7-1 in favor of the suburbs over the central city , according to NAACP figures . In San Francisco , the job rate had increased by 23,000 in town and 202,000 in the sub ? urbs . The Suburban Action Institute , a nonprofit re ? search and planning firm from White Plains , N. Y. , which compiled the NAACP figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 20 largest urban areas lies outside of the core cities . The Institute concluded that something must be done in the suburbs to venti ? late the overcrowded urban slums and give poor blacks and whites a chance to get available jobs . What the NAACP housing officials decided to do was hit the suburbs head-on . NAACP housing director William R. Morris turned up at a board meet ? ing in Oyster Bay , a sprawling conglomerate of wealthy and not-so-wealthy neighborhoods just 3o miles from Bedford-Stuyvesant by Long Island Expressway . Not only does Oyster Bay contain about 3000 acres of vacant residential land , it has the Grumman Aerospace Corp . with 30,000 jobs . Morris told the town 's five startled councilmen that unless they were ready to rezone half of their available residential land for small ? er plots than the present one- and two-acre zoning , and accept low density garden apartments to provide for a massive influx of low- and moderate-income workers earning less than $15,000 a year , he would ' see them in court . " What we 're seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to create a land bank for the devel ? opment of housing in the suburbs that have been closed to poor black and white persons all across the country . " Other areas being eyed by NAACP scouts : wealthy Fairfield and Westchester counties to the north of New York City , DuPage County north of Chicago and suburbs around Indianapolis . In the process , said Morris , the NAACP is prepared to launch a major constitutional court challenge against the whole con ? cept of restrictive suburban zoning , as being in viola ? tion of the 14th Amendment . Massachusetts home rule advocates received their first setback November 21 when a hotly contested lawwent into effect which will force affluent suburbs to set aside a portion of their zoned land for federal low- and middle-income housing . The law , the first of its kind in the country , took four roll calls in the state legis ? lature before it passed 122 to 98 . It gives local com ? munities the right to set health and safety provisions , thus allowing them a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required to give up more than three-tenths of one percent of its residentially zoned land in any one year ; only a small percentage of the land now zoned for large lot devel ? opment will be affected . The bill was pushed through the state legislature by an unusual coalition of suburban liberals and urban conservatives . The latter " voted because they 're glad to see the poor go , " a statehouse observer said . Boston has had a sharp surge of suburban jobs , not ? ably along the new highways 128 and 495 which ring the outskirts of the city . But the jobs they offer , as can be seen in page after page of ads in the Sunday edition of the Boston Globe , are for positions such as elec ? tronics experts . Morris , however , retains his optimism that downing snob zoning will help break up the impacted ghettoes : " In most areas where these industrial strips are going up , there is a constant demand for the unskilled alongside the skilled workers . Up to 10 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers and this is what we 're counting on . " It was nice to hear more than goo Southern Republi ? cans telling each other at the end of the party 's regional conference here that they 'd had a real fine time . They had indeed , one reason being that for all of their recent gains , Republicans in the South still have a sense of loneliness , a feeling that there is something wrong about not still being the Democrats that most of them were before they turned away from what they call , with the undying bitterness of the betrayed , " the national Democrat Party . " Just being together , prov ? ing to each other that so many were prepared to pay their way to New Orleans from the 13 states repre ? sented at this last of four regional Republican confer ? ences , and knowing that the attendance at their conference was better than double that at any of the ' others , was a source of comfort and pride . Clarke Reed , the party 's Mississippi and regional chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see how any libertarian or liberal can deny that what the South needs is a two-party system , " and there was no deny ? ing the evidence here that the South is closer than it has been in a century to meeting the need . There was , however , a plentitude of denial that the Nixon Administration and the Nixon leadership of the Republican Party are helping to meet the need with " a Southern strategy . " Reed , Harry Dent from the White House , Chairman Rogers Morton of the GOP national committee , and every other dignitary on the scene brought the subject up without being asked about it . They argued with striking fervor and , consistency that the " alleged strategy " is actually " a national strategy " that happens to appeal to the South a little more than it appeals to other sections . The only speaker who offered a variation on this theme was Vice President Agnew , who was hailed with stickers reading : SPIRO IS MY HERO . They greeted Agnew with ecstatic applause when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally came to the conclusion that it 's useless to deny that there is a Southern strategy ( Applause ) . But it 's not the strategy of the Republican Party . The Southern strategy is the brain-child of the liberal wing of the bemocratic Party ( Applause ) . The strategy is n't really very complex . It 's simply to criticize , and ridicule , and vilify the people of the South and curry political favor with the powerful , radically led , liberal groups of the ' great industrial cities which are presently ( sic ) in the North and the Midwest . So there 's your Southern strategy ( Ap ? plause ) . And because the people of the South have seen through this transparent demagoguery , they are turn ? ing in droves to the Republican Party . " Apart from this unwitting confession and from a couple of cracks at Democratic Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee for sponsoring , and the Senate majority for approving , a hike in personal income tax exemptions and thereby practicing " demagoguery " and " fiscal ir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to his previous display at New Orleans on Oc ? tober 19 and to his subsequent pyrotechnics . Here , this time , there were no jibes at " impudent snobs " and youthful " rotten apples , " no attacks on television and other news media . The Vice President presented instead the appearance of a handsome , contained , and thor ? oughly complacent robot , an effect that may have been due in part to the fact that two-thirds of his speech was a word-for-word repetition of one he had delivered in Washington the preceding Monday . It occurred later to some of the conferees that their hero had given them very little to cheer except himself . But that , quite evidently , was enough at the time for them and for him . All of the many references by other speakers to Spiro Agnew drew noticeably more applause than ref ? erences to Richard Nixon did . When he was asked whether he saw any chance that Nixon might pickanother running mate in 1972 , Clarke Reed of Missfs ? sippi answered with the utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a Vice President locked in , it 's Vice President Agnew . " " There is very little work going on here , frankly , " Reed also said . Very little was , but at plenary and " workshop " sessions the delegates showed themselves in revealing detail . Most of them , male and female , were white , well off , middle-aged and older , along with a sprinkling of college squares . The very few Negroes were a pathetic lot , tolerated by the white delegates and , according to reliable report , representa ? tive of black constituencies so small as to be practically nonexistent . They did , however , embarrass Harry Dent and state chairmen " Bo " Callaway of Georgia and Duke Crittenden of Alabama with complaints that neither this conference nor the Republican Party was doing anything effective to halt the flight of blacks to the Democratic Party , A white delegate from rural Louisiana embarrassed the platform moguls even more by complaining that those among them who tried to answer the blacks tended to " stutter and fall through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned to his aid none other than Governor Claude Kirk of Florida , who bellowed that he , in person , had visited scores of black schools and slack ghettos and what more could the Negroes want ? The white mayor of a Louisiana toVvn told how he had promised a black bartender at his country club , who wanted a job as census enumerator , that " if you go down and change your registration from Democrat to Republican , I 'll do everything I can to help you . " Duke Crittenden averred in similar vein that the Nixon Administration was doing everything in its power to help the black man but did expect " some response from the black community " in the way of votes for Republicans . When a delegate from his home state , South Carolina , asked Harry Dent whether the Administration sup ? ported or opposed a pending congressional amendment that would legalize the kind of " free choice " school integration rejected by the Supreme Court , Dent sadly replied that HEW Secretary Finch had opposed the amendment , then added with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce the law " and would do so . The delegates were allowed to go on supposing , as they audibly did , that the Ad ? ministration would continue to enforce integration with maximum feasible consideration for the feelings of the white South . Postmaster General Winton Blount of Alabama , the only Southerner in the Nixon Cabinet and the only Cabinet member who graced the occasion , took a lot of floor fire from delegates who resented his plan to place postmasterships on a merit basis . A Texas county chairman asked him when the Nixon Administration was going to come to its senses and realize that " there is no substitute for patronage . " He was also asked , DECEMBER 20 , 1969 with equal bitterness , why the department was not more zealous in shifting its local deposits from banks controlled by Democrats to banks controlled by Re ? publicans . " We all know , " a delegate told him , " that these deposits pay off in campaign contributions , tickets to fund-raising dinners , and so forth . " Blount held out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? fully avowed a determination to run the postal system " on a nonpartisan basis . " Many delegates privately put it to Dent and other White House and national committee operatives that it was high time to apply that famous " Southern strategy " in the shape of more federal jobs for Southerners and less prating about Nixon 's national programs . Next to Agnew , the conference idol was Clement Hayns worth , the South Carolina judge who had been denied Senate confirmation for the Supreme Court . He was present only in spirit , but his case was a source of some dissatisfaction among delegates who 9 supposed that President Nixon could and should have kept his senior Senate leaders , Hugh Scott of Pennsyl ? vania and Robert Griffin of Michigan , from voting against Haynsworth . Nixon himself got enormous credit for backing his nominee to the last , and " Bo " Callaway elicited tremendous cheers when he prom ? ised to inform Judge Haynsworth " that he has re ? ceived a rising ovation of confidence from this group . " The party leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten House seats ' from the South next year turn upon the foundation hope that Nixon 's popularity with white Southerners will con ? tinue as high as it clearly is now . Why is it so high ( 86 percent , according to a CBS poll quoted to the con ? ference by Agnew and Dent ) ? Drake Edens , South Carolina 's quiet and impressive national committee ? man , gave as good an answer as any when he said , " We just feel that he wants to do what the people in our state want him to do . " Most US officers arrived in Vietnam stamped with the notion that since war was indisputably hell , innocent civilians would be killed . It was simply a question of how many . But war 's hell , like Dante 's Inferno , had descending circles of terror . And America , with its fantastic array of killing tools , determined how hot hell became for " noncombatants . " Not long after he issued the civilian casualty directive , Westmoreland approved the USE ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised ? a cluster bomb that combined the horrors of white phosphorus , napalm and fragmentation . More than a half decade before Lieutenant William Calley , Jr. , choppered to Mylai , US army advisers grappled with the problem of fighting a war in which the enemy was so indistinguishable from the innocent that it was often hard to avoid killing both . Their solu ? tion was to rely totally on South Vietnamese govern ? ment and military officials to finger the enemy . With the okay of the South Vietnamese , huge chunks of South Vietnam territory were designated as free fire zones on US military maps . American planes and artillery were given carte blanche to bomb and kill everything that moved in these " enemy " zones , which often included populous areas . Thus , two deadly precedents of the war were estab ? lished . First , the US military defined the enemy in terms of geographical territory , rather than in terms of insurgents interspersed in a largely uncommitted popu ? lation . All persons and animals in enemy zones were considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
