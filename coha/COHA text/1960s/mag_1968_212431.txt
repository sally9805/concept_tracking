" When I really believe in something , " says hard-driving NBC Documentary Producer Lucy Jarvis , " nothing stops me . " Her television credits justify the bravado . In 1962 , she cajoled Nikita Khrushchev into letting her film a special inside the Kremlin-a privilege never before permitted even the Soviet network . The following year , she collared France 's Cultural Affairs Minister Andr Malraux and demanded : " If Khrushchev trusted me , why ca n't you ? " - and gained TV 's first penetration of the Louvre . If guile or gall does not work , there is always main strength . Once when a Tokyo airport functionary tried to prevent her from covering an arrival scene , she simply let the poor fellow have it on the back of the neck with a karate chop . <P> Last week the irresistible force was at least slowed down . The project was an NBC documentary advertised as " Dr. Barnard 's Heart Transplant Operations . " Immediately after the Washkansky operation last month , Mrs. Jarvis set about gathering material for a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot biographical background footage on Surgeon Christiaan Barnard , interviewed his friends and medical colleagues , and filmed Barnard and his team as they performed open-heart surgery . She also discussed with Barnard the technical problems of covering the next heart-transplant operation , and came away with the impression that he would permit filming from behind a glass partition in the operating room . <P> " Shut Out . " Then came the flurry of demands for Barnard 's presence . CBS paid his air fare to the U.S. so that he could be interviewed on Face the Nation ( TIME , Jan. 5 ) - and , according to CBS News President Richard Salant , donated $5,000 in a charitable gesture to the Christiaan Barnard Research Fund . Suddenly , says Lucy Jarvis , " we found ourselves shut out . We could hardly get near him " - although Barnard did appear on NBC 's Today show . <P> In any case , " to protect the network , " Lucy Jarvis negotiated an agreement with Barnard 's next patient , Philip Blaiberg , and his family . NBC would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25,000 for exclusive movie and still pictures of the operation itself , and $16,000 for exclusive post-operation coverage . Was this the start of an internetwork auction ? Decidedly no , says CBS 's Salant . " We did not bid for anything , and we did n't offer anyone anything . We do n't believe in payments for rights to a hard-news story . Dr. Barnard does n't belong to anybody , he belongs to the world . " For its part , CBS was determined to get its cameraman into Barnard 's next operation along with NBC 's . <P> Sneaked Stills . As luck-and medicine-would have it , neither network got in . The Blaiberg operation came up too fast , and Barnard barred all film crews from the operation . A Cape Town fashion photographer , posing as a medical student , did sneak into the operating-room observation gallery and grabbed some stills ; NBC attorneys got a temporary injunction prohibiting him from " selling or disposing " of them . A doctor who had brought his subminiature camera into the operation also took a few pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
