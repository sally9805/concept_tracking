a  | ENGLISH AND AMERICAN EDUCATION Depth versus Breadth FoR the past three years I have been engaged , with my colleagues of the Central Advisory Council on Education in England , in a comprehensive study of the English educational system . I had some of my own education in the United States , and I have been a frequent visitor to America ever since . This double experience has bred in me a growing sense of astonishment that two countries which share the same language , so many of the same cultural traditions and ways of life , whose political , religious , and social aspirations are so largely identical , should have educational systems so utterly different as to provide almost no basis for a comparison between them . That is a strong statement , and my present purpose is to try to justify it . Let me first say , however , that I have no intention whatever of trying to show that one national system is , on balance , better than the other ; only that they are much more different than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different in purpose , structure , and method . Let us start with purpose . The two systems grew up in response to very different pressures and needs . In America , you have always been very conscious of the need to build up a new society . You have wanted to construct something bigger , richer , better than you have . This is said to arise from something in the American national character , but that seems to me to turn the logic upside down ; it is the American national character that has arisen from the circumstances in which the American people have found themselves . From the start it was necessary to create a supply of ministers of religion , of lawyers , and of skilled artisans ? I place them in the order of importance in which they were regarded at the time . Later on there came the obvious necessity of incorporating the great waves of immigrants into your society . Still later came the great task , in which you are still engaged , of knitting your varied economic , social , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of democratic government can work properly . Consciously or unconsciously , American education has at all times been designed to serve these social purposes . It has been regarded as an instrument by which society can build its own future . From its nature , it has inescapably been concerned with the rank and file of the people . Its chief concern for many generations has been to do something to the masses ? and I think the word is to , not for ? in the interests of the American dream . All this , of course , is platitude in America .  | What may not be quite so familiar is the contrast in the historical situation in England . We have never been very conscious of the necessity to build a new society . At all relevant times we have had a fully developed society already in being . And at all relevant times we have also , I am sorry to say , been on the whole pretty satisfied with the society we have . For most of the last two hundred years , American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; English education has been designed primarily for maintenance , with improvement coming second . In the very latest period , perhaps , those attitudes have started to change . As with so many aspects of education , there seem to be the first signs of a tendency to change sides . Your education is becoming socially more conservative just when ours is becoming more consciously radical . But that is a speculation for the future , on which I will not enlarge . I am talking of the influences of the past , which have shaped the structures of today . American education has always had to concern itself with the common man in his multitudes . The concern of English education has until very recently been with the maintenance of society , in the words of the old prayer which you will often hear in school and college chapels , " that there may never be wanting a succession of persons duly qualified to serve God in church and state . " This is a conception which does not necessarily embrace the education of the great mass . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . But it is not a tradition of education , above the minimum level , for the multitude . Post-primary education has always been thought of as a privilege in England ; it was not until 1944 that the principle of secondary education for all was established , and it is hardly yet fully effective . Let me pursue this contrast a little further . Let me give you two of the consequences , of which I would guess that one will shock you , while the other may perhaps surprise you more favorably . I will start with the shocker . The consequence of our different attitude is that the sheer size , the volume or quantity , of English education is very much smaller than American . The age at which the legal compulsion to attend school expires is still only fifteen . Moreover , that is an effective leaving age , and more than four children out of five in fact leave school before they are sixteen . Of the sixteen-year-old age group ? those between their sixteenth and seventeenth birthdays ? only 22 per cent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure falls to 13 per cent of the boys and 11 per cent of the girls . Among eighteen-year-olds , it is 8 per cent of the boys and 5.5 per cent of the girls . What strikes Americans , I find , as even odder than these figures is the fact that we are not , as a nation , greatly disturbed by them , although many of us think they ought to be larger . But we can not assume that public opinion is on our side . I am very doubtful whether there would be any support in public opinion for a policy of keeping the majority of children in school after sixteen , and I am certain that you would find hardly anyone in England who believes , as you do , in keeping all children at school until eighteen . Our college students represent about 3 per cent of each age group , and there is an expansion program in hand that will raise it to about 5 per cent . Anybody who suggested that we needed any more than that would meet with the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This attitude does not arise from any lack of love for our children . It is not because we think we ca n't afford it . The proportion of our national income that we spend on general welfare services ? social security , health , and the like ? is about the highest in the world . It is not from lack of generosity or lack of means that we confine education after the middle teens to a minority . 3t is because we sincerely believe that it is the right thing to do , in the interests of the children themselves . After all , there can be no absolute rules about education . Nobody believes that any child should be allowed to leave school at twelve . I do not suppose a time will ever come when , even in America , it will become legal or compulsory for everyone to stay in full-time education until twenty-five . Where you fix the age between those limits is surely a matter of judgment . And why should it be the same age for all children ? Our belief in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school against what can be got out of life , the average boy or girl has probably had the optimum dose after eleven years of schooling ? and do not forget that we begin , by legal compulsion , at the age of five . Eleven years , after all , is one year out of every six or seven of the average lifetime . Now let me give you the other side of the medal . Because education after fifteen or sixteen is confined to a minority , that minority gets every assistance that the state can provide . It is nowadays , to an overwhelming extent , a minority chosen for intelligence and attainment . There are , of course , still the independent schools , where very substantial fees have to be paid . But the pressure of numbers upon them is such that'la - stupid boy or girl will have great difficulty getting in . And in the state schools , selection is by merit 38  | only . But once selected , a boy finds himself with his foot not so much on a ladder as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best schools concentrated on him . If he can secure a place in a university , and that also is a matter of selection by merit , the state will pay his tuition fees and his living expenses , not only during the session but during the vacation as well . There is no such thing as working your way through college in England . We do not need a National Merit Scholarship scheme because we have one already . Nor is this a recent thing . It has been expanded in recent years , but it has always existed . LET me move on to structure . The outstanding difference here lies in the fact that we have a very much smaller degree of local control than you do . There are about 50,000 school boards in the United States , each of them , I suppose , more or less free to run the schools as it thinks best . That gives a total population in the average school board area of about 3500 persons . In England there are about 130 local education authorities , which gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are two other differences , apart from this sharp difference in size . Your school boards consist , I believe , in most states , of persons specially elected for the purpose , with no other duties . In England the schools are run by the county council , or the borough council , which is the general-purpose government of the area . Second , your school boards raise their own money by direct taxes , or at least the greater part of it . In England about 70 per cent of the expenditure of the local education authorities is met out of grants from the central government in London . There are advantages and disadvantages in this . It means that we do not have the enormous range in standards between rich areas , and poor areas that you do . It means a much greater degree of standardization of conditions of employment among the teachers , and therefore of interchangeability between school and school and between area and area . But it also inevitably means a greater degree of uniformity imposed from the center . . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more local freedom and variety than exist in the school systems of most Continental European countries . But there is no doubt that it is much more highly centralized than the American system . The other great difference under the heading of structure is the principle of selection upon which our system is based . All children , except the minority in fee-paying schools , go to undifferentiated schools from the age of five to the age of eleven . At eleven or thereabouts , a proportion of them , varying from area to area but averaging between 20 and 25 per cent , is selected for what we call grammar schools , which include children to the age of eighteen , though not all the pupils stay that long . The remainder go to what are called secondary modern schools , which include children to age fifteen and increasingly to sixteen , but no older . You will see from this description that the crucial time for an English child is at the age of eleven or a little more . The selection test then applied -- the famous or infamous eleven-plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and aptitude , without any suspicion of being derogatory to those who are not selected . But , of course , everybody wants to be selected , and with the growing pressure of numbers as a result of the post-war bulge of population , the selection has been getting steadily more competitive . As the result of agitation , the Labor Party has adopted the policy of abolishing the elevenplus examination by sending all children at that age to the same schools , the so-called comprehensive secondary schools . The Labor Party has moved toward this system in several of the areas where it controls the local council , and even in - Conservative areas there is a distinct movement to experiment with systems that do not involve sending children to different schools at the age of eleven . I have several times seen this movement quoted in America as evidence that English education is turning away from selection . I think this is a grave misunderstanding . The public objection to selection at eleven is social and political , not educational . It is an objection on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to their having different educations . And the remedies that are being applied are wholly in terms of institutions , not in terms of the education they provide . I know , for example , one large new comprehensive school built by a Labor council . Every child entering that school is tested and placed in one of fifteen " streams , " differentiated by the children 's intelligence and aptitude . This selection is done by the teachers ; the parents have nothing to do with it ; and the children are not even supposed to know which stream is which in intelligence grading . A child placed in one of the top streams will have an almost wholly different education from a child placed even in one of the middle streams . If this is not selection , I do not know the meaning of the term . But this is what we mean by a comprehensive school . Many people in England will tell you that the comprehensive school has been copied from the American ' I '  | comprehensive high school , some meaning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have often told them that they could hardly be more mistaken . Nonselection ? if that is the opposite of selection ? as it is practiced in America is totally unknown in England . By nonselection I mean the principle of treating all children alike , allowing them to sort themselves out by their choice of courses , by what they find easy and difficult , or by their varying ambitions ? with counseling assistance , no doubt , but without any compulsory segregations . I am sure that your system seems as odd to us as ours does to you . There is no retreat from selection in England ; the only change is that a growing number of people ? but still a minority ? think that the selection should be within a common school , not between schools . THE differences between the two countries in educational method make an enormous subject , and I must restrict myself to four points out of many that it would be possible to make . The first of these differences in method lies in the position of the teacher , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the things about American education that most strikes the English visitor is the importance you attach to textbooks . We have no parallel to that . To begin with , I do not think there are more than two or three , at most , of the local education authorities in England that tell their schools what textbooks to use . That is left to the teacher , occasionally the principal , or the head of department in a large school . And in the higher grades , more often than not , there is not a textbook at all . A teacher will often recommend a book as covering the subject pretty well and as being useful for reference but will not make any attempt to go through it chapter by chapter . This system places a much greater responsibility on the individual teacher , and I have often been asked in America whether we do not have a lot of trouble with it . So far as the political and social responsibility , of the teacher is concerned , I can not recall having heard of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a book which seems offensive or objectionable to somebody in authority . That is partly , perhaps mainly , because our system of large authorities and rather remote and indirect public control puts the individual teacher largely out of the reach of vigilance committees , whether of parents or of the local chamber of commerce . There is also a strong tradition against anything that smacks of political interference with the schools . Educational responsibility , however , is another matter . Quite clearly , a system like ours , which places so much responsibility on the individual teacher , can not work well unless the average standard of intelligence , knowledge , and teaching competence is high . Up to the present , we have been able to maintain that standard . It is partly . of course , a matter of numbers . In the whole of England last year there were only some 260,000 schoolteachers . We were a little short , but 300,000 would have given us all we need . And this is in a country about one quarter the size of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , but I am very sure it is many more than four times 300,000 . I do not see how you could possibly have coped with the enormous increase in the American school population in the past forty years without being willing to take thousands of young men and women who needed close support from a textbook before they could teach . Indeed , under the pressure of rising numbers in the schools , I fear we shall find before long that we shall have to give the teacher more assistance , and that implies more external control on his teaching . This particular contrast is not , however , entirely a matter of numbers . . It is partly also the result of a different tradition of teacher training , which , in England , has always laid a much greater emphasis on the content of what is to be taught than in America and much less on questions of pedagogic method . The second difference in method is the absence in England of the course system which is so universal in your schools and colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly different meaning in the two countries . If you asked an English school child what courses he was taking , he would n't know what you meant . If you asked him what subjects he was taking , he would answer English . Latin , mathematics , history , and so forth . But that would not mean , as it would in America , that those were the subjects he had chosen to take . They would be the subjects that his form , or class , was taking , and therefore that he was taking with the rest of the class . Until the boy is about fifteen or sixteen , it is unlikely that he or his parents have had any say in the choice of form in which he is placed . And at no age does he have any say in deciding the curriculum of that form . At the higher ages , there is a choice between three or four different curriculums , but each curriculum has to be taken , within narrow limits , as it stands . Here , indeed , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite so sharp a contrast in practice as it is in principle , as I observe that , more and more , those American boys and girls who have ambition to gain admittance to a good college find their choice of courses in high school )  | made for them by the college entrance requirements . But there is one important consequence r teaching that is worth bringing out . In an nglish school , in any year but one ( and that one what we call the fifth form year , about the age of fourteen or fifteen ) , you can assume that the pupils who are taking a subject in one year will be taking the same subject next year . The study of a subject can therefore be planned as a continuous process over a period of years . That is what we mean when we use the word " course . " We mean a whole balanced curriculum of six or seven or eight subjects , planned to continue over three or four or five years . Once a boy or girl enters on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the end . And all the boys and girls in a course will take substantially the same subjects , with perhaps slight options , as between a second classical or a second modern language . You will therefore understand how bewildered we are when we contemplate one of your neat , packaged , self-contained , nine-month courses , such as high school physics . It is no good asking an English schoolboy when he enters college how many years of French he has had at school . Two boys might both truthfully answer nine years . But they might mean totally- different things , and neither one would mean what you thought he meant . How , then , do we measure what a student has accomplished , if we can not count up the number of courses he has satisfactorily taken ? The answer is that we rely , to an extent wholly unknown to you , on general examinations . Every year ? sometimes every term ? the pupil has to take a written examination in all the subjects of the curriculum , and his further progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination . Most of these examinations are set and assessed within the school itself , by his own teachers . But at three crucial points in his career the examination is set and assessed by an external body . The first of these is the eleven-plus examination , which determines to which sort of secondary school the child should go . The second comes at fifteen or sixteen and is called the Ordinary Level of the General Certificate of Education , set and assessed by one of nine examining boards closely associated with the universities . This examination can be taken in any number of subjects from one upwards , but the most usual practice is to take it in from five to nine subjects . Third , there is the Advanced Level of the General Certificate of Education , which is taken at eighteen or thereabouts and which plays a large part in university entrance . I have been describing the practice of the grammar schools ; that is , the schools for the brightest 20 to 25 per cent of the children . Examinations , especially written examinations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less intelligent children . Even in this case , however , they play a much larger part than they do in America ; and there is a rising demand for public examinations , at lower standards of intelligence than those of the General Certificate of Education , for these less gifted children . I can not honestly say that the children themselves clamor for examinations , but employers do , and therefore so do the parents . All the questions that Americans ask and answer in terms of the number and variety of courses a student has taken we ask and answer in terms of the examinations he has passed . I HAVE left to the last what is the sharpest difference of all between our two systems . This is our system of specialization , in which England is , I think , unique in the world . A student will take the examination for the Ordinary Level of the General Certificate of Education at the age of fifteen or sixteen in a wide range of subjects drawn both from the humanities and from the natural sciences . But once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is to say , he will devote two thirds , or perhaps even more , of his time in school to a narrow range of subjects . In one boy 's case it may be physics , chemistry , and mathematics ; in another 's it may be chemistry and biology , or it may be history or modern languages and literature , or classical languages and philosophy . But , whatever the choice , the greater part of the pupil 's attention , in the classroom and in his private study time , is given to his specialty , and he will take the advanced level examination at eighteen in his special subjects only . When he gets to the university , the specialization is even more intense . The range of subjects does not usually get any narrower , but the student gives 100 per cent of his time to it . I have found that to Americans , and indeed to educationalists from every country in the world except England , this seems a very strange system indeed . Perhaps you will have difficulty in believing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cite my own case , though it is now more than thirty years old . I was a modern languages specialist . For my last three years at school , from the ages of fifteen to eighteen , I studied mostly French and German language and literature , perhaps three or four hours a week of history , and one hour of Scripture on Sundays . For another two years at Cambridge , even the history and the Scripture were cut out , and I studied French and German exclusively . Five years of my life were given to those languages . My experience was 41  | perhaps a little extreme ; I think the admixture of general and contrasting subjects would nowadays , in a good school , be a little bigger . But the difference would not be great . The English boy or girl is a specialist from the age of fifteen or sixteen . The advisory council of which I am chairman was specifically requested by the Minister of Education to review this system of specialization . We examined it most carefully and discussed it at great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end we came to the conclusion that we wanted to see it continued . We found that it was being pushed too far , and we have made a number of suggestions for removing what we think are abuses . But we have reported in favor of this system of specialization . And that is a unanimous conclusion reached by a council made up of educators of all kinds . Perhaps you will find that fact as extraordinary as the system itself , and I must try to give you some of our reasons for thinking that , in this matter , we in England are in step and the whole of the rest of the world is out of step . Let me begin by telling you of one argument that we reject . This is the argument that every intelligent citizen , or every educated man , ought to know something about each subject in a range so wide that it compels a balanced curriculum ; that no one can afford to be ignorant of history , government , science , languages , and so forth . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , it is true that there are certain elementary skills and knowledges that everyone must have ? reading , writing , arithmetic , and several more . But these essential elements can be , and should be , provided by the age of sixteen . If you go on with them after that age , you will be wasting your time , because the knowledge you instill will be forgotten unless it can be attached to the main intellectual interest of a boy 's or girl 's life , which begins to emerge at about that age . The second part of the answer is that it is only when you have got these essential elementary skills and knowledges out of the way that you can confront the real task of education . The acquisition of factual knowledge is by itself a poor test of any education and a lamentably poor test of the education of boys and girls of seventeen and eighteen . It has been said that the process of education is not to be compared to that of filling up an empty pot , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an education is whether is teaches the pupil to think and whether it awaken ' his interest in applying his brain to the variou ' problems and opportunities that life presents . If these have once been done ; then factual knowledge can easily be assimilated ' ' :  - -  W these have not been done , then no amount of nodding acquaintance with widely varying fields of human knowledge will equip a boy or girl with an educated mind . We in England argue the case for specialization not primarily on the score of the information it provides but because it awakens interest , teachc ' clear thinking , and induces self-discipline in study . We believe that , if you can find which of the recognized intellectual disciplines most arouses a boy 's interest ? and we confine his choice to five or six recognized disciplines , chosen for their intellectual content , not for their vocational value ? if you can let him spend his time on what interests him , but insist that he- must work hard at it . go deep into it , follow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the stage scenery that defines the formal academic subject , you will really be teaching him how to use the mind that God has given him . This sort of intensive study takes a great deal of time , and that is why it can only be applied , for any one student , to a restricted range of subjects . No doubt you will say that the boy must be very narrow as a result . That may be . Are you sure that being narrow is worse than being shallow ? I find that English education has a high reputation among Americans . I am often asked , for example , whether it is not true that the eighteenyear-old boy in England is a year or two ahead of his American contemporary . I always answer that question , or assertion , by asking some others . What boy ? If an English boy is still at school at eighteen , he is necessarily in the upper quartile in intelligence . Are you comparing him with the average American high school graduate , who is of average intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has been giving nearly all his time and attention for two years ? It would be strange if he were not a long way ahead in those . Or over the whole range of a broad curriculum ? He has been taught different . things , by different methods , with a different purpose in view , in a different sort of school . There is no fair basis for a comparative judgment .
