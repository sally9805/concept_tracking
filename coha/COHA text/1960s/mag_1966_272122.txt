Komsomols at the Crossroads <P> Komsomolskaya Pravda 's Ace Reporter V. Chikin was as shocked as any other true atheist by the letters pouring in from outraged readers . They complained that young people were snapping up gold-plated crosses on sale in state-run shops . Crosses ! Sniffing a scoop , Chikin went snooping . <P> Sure enough . He was no more than 20 steps inside the main entrance of GUM , the Soviet Union 's largest department store , when his eyes fixed on the deep decolletages of two young sales girls . There , hanging from their necks , were glittering gold crosses . No , they said , they were not Catholics , but faithful Komsomols ( Young Communists ) . <P> No , the crosses had no meaning . They were merely the latest fad . Fashion , Chikin , fashion-and profit . GUM Buyer Klavdia Mikhailovna picked up the trinkets for 330 each , presumably from a Czech costume-jewelry firm , which has been flooding Eastern Europe with such baubles . Klavdia put them on sale for $3.33 , turning a neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union , where selling Bibles can lead to banishment , Klavdia was just a little too avantgarde . By week 's end Chikin could report in a follow-up story that the doublecross to dialectical materialism had been avenged . Klavdia was suddenly jobless .
