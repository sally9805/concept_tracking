Astronomers have long known pre cisely how fast the earth moves as it cir cles around its own star , the sun ( 66,500 m.p.h. ) , and how fast the solar system revolves around the core of its own galaxy , the Milky Way ( 481,000 m.p.h . ) . <P> They have even been able to compute the astounding speed with which the Milky Way moves around the center of a supercluster of 2,500 neighboring galaxies ( 1,350,000 m.p.h . ) . Yet the earth and the Milky Way are also in motion with respect to the vast reaches of the universe itself. * <P> While scientists have often speculated about this universal speed , they have never been able to record or measure it . For one thing , they lacked a suitable frame of reference in which they could clock the earth 's speed through the universe as a whole . Now , a young Stanford University astronomer has made such a computation by using a phenomenon so distant in origin that it can be considered at the very outer limits of the cosmos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milky Way galaxy , the earth is hurtling through space at 360,000 m.p.h . <P> As his celestial speedometer , Dr. Edward K. Conklin , 27 , used the faint field of high-frequency radiation that seems to blanket all parts of the heavens . These scattered signals , first detected by scientists of the Bell Telephone Laboratories four years ago , may well be the remnants of the primordial flash that , according to many astronomers , gave birth to the universe more than 10 billion years ago . Just as a cyclist feels more of a breeze when he rides with the wind in his face rather than at his back , the lingering radiation from the so-called " big bang " would appear slightly stronger to an observer on earth when the planet is moving toward the radio waves . Conklin figured that if he could somehow determine the apparent excess of radiation caused by the earth 's own motion , he could , in fact , then measure the motion itself . <P> Expanding Universe . Conklin set up two small radio telescope antennas at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak near Yosemite National Park , and pointed them in opposite directions . For 23 days , the antennas swept different quadrants of the skies ; periodically they were reversed to reduce the risk of built-in electronic error . By comparing the slight variations in readings , Conklin was able to calculate the earth 's velocity toward the distant sea of radiation . <P> He may also have found possible confirmation of the " big bang " theory . If the universe had indeed been born in a cataclysmic explosion eons ago , it would still be expanding in all directions . Despite their continued drift away from the original blast , the individual parts of the universe would remain in approximately the same position in relation to one another - much like the lettering on the surface of an expanding balloon . That , says Conklin , is the pattern of galactic movement indicated by his observations .
