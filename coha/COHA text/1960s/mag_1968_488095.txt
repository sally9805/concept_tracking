When Curtis LeMay was a child , he earned spending money by killing sparrows and selling them to a lady as food for her tomcat . One gathers from his autobiography , Mission with LeMay , that that is his happiest boyhood memory . His most exciting memory is of seeing a stunt flier die buried in mud . A lonely , plodding boy , LeMay had a vile temper which he did not learn to control , by 422 his own admission , until he was an adult . His life at school was completely drab and uninspiring . No teacher took an interest in him : " It is a common human experience to have enjoyed , during school years , the companionship and encouragement of some particular teacher . . . . I do n't remember anything of that sort occurring , to me . " Outside school , he seems to have worked constantly and had no time for sports or club activities or what he calls " boyand-girl stuff . " At home , the other members of the family all but ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LeMay 's business . I do n't think anyone gave it much thought or cared whether I would get through or flunk , , , , , out , or what . " Life , in any real sense , did not begin for LeMay until m , he joined the U.S. Air Force . He is one of those strange creatures who have sprung from our military incubus ! , uneasy , if not unhappy , except when they are planning , , , ; devastation . Like many of this breed , LeMay has con- ' siderable insight into his own character and is rather AA forthright in describing what he sees : " I have been ? accused and still am accused of possessing a single-track mind . Guess they are right . " He is the compleat warrior . Bravery and skill at killing are what matter to him , not ideology . He speaks kindly of Mao Tse-tung , recalling a samurai sword he received from the Chinese Communist overlord during World War II . Says LeMay : " Would n't be surprised if Mao had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reputation as a scrapper . " Nazi scrappers draw similarly amiable appraisals from LeMay  --  as fighters , not as Nazis . On the other hand he is immediately suspicious of soldiers who claim combat fatigue ; a person can be the most loyal capitalistic democrat in every other respect , but if he cracks mentally under the strain of battle , LeMay is likely to dismiss him as " the louse , the bum , the yellow so-and-so . . . this stinko character ; he 's just scairt . " ( Breaking physically is , by LeMay 's standards , permissible . ) One ? wonders if he knows that his Presidential running mate + was mustered out of the Air Force with a 10 per cent disability rating for " psychoneurosis " after being hospitalized for " severe anxiety state , chronic , manifested by tension states , anxiety attacks , anorexia .. . . " When LeMay retired in 1965 at the age of 5,8 ? hurried onto the shelf by President Johnson because of his perpetual feuding with Defense Secretary McNamara he had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thirteen years , which was longer than any other person had held the rank . The moment of - greatest pride in his career was probably the bombing raid he masterminded that left 16 square miles of Tokyo in rubble , and caused more deaths and injuries than any other single military operation in history . He had wanted , to lead the raid from the air , he said , but was obliged to direct it from headquarters and " it was no fun . " Now that LeMay has emerged again from his Los Angeles suburban home in Bel Air and taken temporary leave of his job as head of Network Electronics Corp. , in Chatsworth , Calif. , to join the American Independent Party ticket as Vice Presidential candidate , a large segment of the press is attempting to portray him as a uniquely frightening addition to the political picture . And of course ' he is frightening ; but it is a distortion to make him seem so exceptional . He is little more frightening than Hum- , phrey or Agnew or Nixon or Muskie ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 U.S. Senators and a , ' similar proportion of the U.S. House of Representatives , - favor a Pentagon budget of $72 billion , the largest in - history and one that is not entirely honest because it does not cover certain war-related expenses , such as the cost of keeping up veterans ' hospitals and GI Bill expenses and veterans ' pensions . LeMay is certainly no more frightTHE NATION/October 28 , 1968 ening than the Pennsylvania labor leader who denounced Senator Clark 's efforts to shave the Pentagon budget as " a threat to the safety of United States fighting men and the jobs of Pennsylvania workers . " The trouble with ballooning him into such an impressive ogre is that we may be inclined to heave a sigh of relief when he and ' Wallace are defeated  --  as though it made all that difference . So , just to keep a proper perspective on this most normal American killer , let us run over LeMay 's positions : He , like Nixon , is against the multilateral , nuclear ban . He reasons that , while other nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A-weapons and eventually gain superiority . He was the first , or at least the loudest , top official in the Pentagon to urge bombing North Vietnam ; he has never urged use of atomic weapons in the war , although he has counseled against saying we would not . Wallace 's own firm statement that he would never use atomic weapons in Vietnam seems to have been no more than a panicky reaction to the way the press jumped on LeMay 's " just another weapon " appraisal of nuclear bombs . But Wallace 's staff , an oily crowd , began at once to explain 423 Wallace 's aversion to radioactive dust in sentimental terms . Paul W. Valentine of The Washington Post wrote : " Part of this feeling , his associates say , came from talks with doctors in Houston while his wife was receiving radiation treatment for cancer that ultimately was fatal to her . Through those talks , they said , Wallace came to realize how much radiation can damage the body . " Maybe . But this postdated solicitude for Mrs. Wallace 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out campaigning for governor less than four months after her first cancer operation and kept her in harness almost to the end , her hold on the governor 's office giving him a good base of operation . LeMay 's proposals for A-bomb usage have gone far beyond Vietnam . Back in the days when we had the A-bomb and Russia did not , LeMay is said to have called a secret meeting of top officials and proposed wiping out Russia . He does n't deny this very firmly . He says , " I do n't ever remember having called such a meeting , " but he admits that he might have told " some of my people at one time or another , ' We 've got this capability . Maybe the nation ought to do it . ' I might have said that off the cuff . But never did I make any such formal suggestion . " But he came very close to making it formal . And in any event , he still likes to say we may " look sadly back " to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have a sufficient stockpile to retaliate . " That was the era when we might have destroyed Russia completely and not even skinned our elbows doing it . " What 's more , since the same conditions still exist apropos of China , he now asks if we are n't missing a chance there . We still could do it " before the Chinese military potential grows worse than it is today . " LeMay 's mind is so uncluttered and his reasoning so simple that he sees nothing odd in quoting from an Air Force/Space Digest editorial as objective support of his own objectivity . He is startlingly naive . While most military men and politicians pretend that a military-industrial power ring does not exist , LeMay goes out of his way publicly to encourage this group to take a firmer hand in shaping government policy . At a meeting of the National Security Industrial Association in Washington three years ago , he rallied " the military , industrial and ' scientific communities " to a firmer display of patriotic propaganda " in direct proportion to the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a look at the budget shows , is a very great proportion indeed . LeMay does not think the civilian branch of the government should interfere in the slightest with the plans of the generals , except to cut back an the money if it can . " If a Secretary of Defense says , ' No , you can not have this system because we can not afford it , ' we accept his decision . What we did object to was the Secretary 's saying ' no ' to something the military wished to do , and giving a military reason . " Since he would limit the civilian administration to fiscal controls , he is giving the civilians no control at all , for Congress never denies the military anything on grounds of economy . LeMay is a right winger but a very clumsy one . He has written a book that is almost a Bible to the right 424 wing , but he used a collaborator , McKinley Kantor , whoie Andersonville was one of the favorite targets of the right wing a few years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows all the right-wing clich ? positions , but he takes them in a very gauche manner . " I 'm for welfare programs , Medicare , for instance , " he says . " Certainly this country ought to provide medical care for everybody , but I do n't say the government has to do it " On civil rights : " I ca n't understand all the fuss about this civil rights business . The trouble is being caused by a bunch of professional no-goods , Communists . I think the Communists are up to their eyebrows in the civil rights movement . As a matter of fact , I know it . I 've seen some of the reports . These reports were never made public . " ( Apparently shown to him by his close friend J. Edgar Hoover , who enjoys passing " confidential " files around among a select circle of pals . ) He even has a right-wing clich ? for the war , which he says he would end by the total destruction of North Vietnam ? " leaving not one brick stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most humane manner possible . " The only effective right-wing organization to which LeMay belongs is the American Security Council  --  an anti-subversive outfit which has been guided over the past few years by such illustrious far-outs as Adm . Ben Moreell , USN retired , and Gen. A. C. Wedemeyer , USA retired  --  but which nevertheless sneaks some of its propaganda into top places . Last year , for example , The " Yew York Times played up a front-page story saying that the American Security Council had discovered we were desperately behind in the missile race  --  and did not mention that the ASC was a right-wing front . After LeMay 's maiden campaign speech , an outburst of candor which got him in immediate trouble with Wallace ( but gave the newsmen priceless quotes , such as , " I 'll be lucky if I do n't come out of this sounding like a drooling idiot " ) , Wallace has used the tactic of displaying A LeMay but letting him say very little . It 's just as well for his cause . LeMay has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , a tendency to drone and to say " uh , " and a weakness of mental will that allows him to wander off into the dullest kind of homey trivialities . As for the dead-pan part , - spectators can give him a little sympathy on that . It is caused by a stroke he suffered in the early 1940s . That stroke , plus some deafness ( Wallace also suffers from deafness ) , plus poor eyesight , plus prostate trouble , prompted a medical officers ' board to give him 60 per cent disability when he was mustered out of service . Still , one must be a bit cautious with sympathy . After all , LeMay was flying jets right up to the end of his service ? and drawing flight pay for it  --  and on the afternoon he retired from the Air Force , FAA Administrator Najeeb Halaby hoked up a special ceremony in which he presented LeMay with a private pilot 's license . And the 60 per cent disability rating allows him to avoid income tax payments on about $10,000 of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of monsters , and must indeed be defeated . But the bigger worry still remains with whom are you going to defeat them ? THE NATION/ October 28 , 1968
