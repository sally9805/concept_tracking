He descended into Hell ; the third day he rose again from the dead ; he ascended into Heaven . <P> In unequivocal terms , the traditional Apostles ' Creed sums up one of the central mysteries of Christianity : God 's promise of eternal paradise or perdition beyond the grave . Millions of Christians recite the Creed as an affirmation of their faith . Yet many theologians are now attempting to redefine heaven and hell in this-worldly terms-not as places where humans somehow survive after death , but as states of mind and modes of being that begin here on earth . As they see it , the world itself is the supreme opportunity for man 's fulfillment and salvation , and the afterlife a " spiritual dimension " that emphasizes the noblest traits and aspirations of this life . <P> Most Christian theologians readily agree that eschatology-the doctrine of death and the afterlife-owes more to superstition than to supernatural wisdom .

In the Middle Ages , Dante confidently limned a topography of the beyond that seemed as convincingly detailed as a map of Italy . <P> To eras in which life was a cruel trial of disease and despair , there was deep comfort in the dream of heaven as God 's good-conduct reward . Now that man has more and more conquered nature , eternity has become more and more distant . " A certain satisfaction with this world has replaced the aspiration for heaven , " says Italy 's Roman Catholic Philosopher Ettore Albino .
