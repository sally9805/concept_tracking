Diamond Jim Brady went there regularly , accompanied by 27 Japanese houseboys and Lillian Russell . One day William K. Vanderbilt strolled into the casino to await some delayed dinner companions , dropped $130,000 in a few minutes . Another day John W. ( " Bet a Million " ) Gates lost $500,000 on the races , then proceeded to win back most of it by playing faro until dawn . In the afternoons , Victor Herbert conducted concerts on the porch of an elegant hotel ; - in the evenings , Caruso and John McCormack sang outdoors . Such was the summer scene at the turn of the century at Saratoga Springs , New York 's celebrated resort for socialites , tycoons and just plain millionaires . <P> That golden heyday is gone . Though the ponies still run in August , the casinos were shuttered by law in 1950 , and the noisome waters of Saratoga 's springs - once sipped for everything from dropsy to hangovers - have been washed out by wonder drugs . Yet Saratoga is awakening , to a different kind of tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first-rate music and dance festivals in the U.S. , if not the world . In the summer , more and more of the major U.S. symphony orchestras and dance companies are packing their tubas and tutus , fleeing the sweltering cities for theaters in the sticks . And many of them are settling in and around the place where Diamond Jim and Bet a Million used to gambol . <P> Like Ballpark Hot Dogs . Last week the old spa took on a fresh eminence with the opening of the Saratoga Per forming Arts Center , the most impres sive of the many new U.S. summer theaters . Nestled in a pine-fringed hollow , the center will be the summer residence of George Balanchine 's New York City Ballet and Eugene Ormandy 's Philadelphia Orchestra . The theater itself , designed by Manhattan 's Vollmer Associates , is one of the world 's largest , seating up to 5,100 inside and another 7,000 outside . People who perch on the upward-sloping lawns pay $2 each , get an unobstructed view of the stage . <P> Somehow Beethoven under the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relished all the more by virtue of the setting . <P> Saratoga is just the latest jewel in the neighborhood . Within easy driving distance are : <P> &gt; The Marlboro Music Festival , where Pianist Rudolf Serkin plays host to 85 musicians from around the world for the best sessions of chamber music on the summer circuit . The concerts , with such as Cellist Pablo Casals , are held in a 630-seat theater at Marlboro , Vt . <P> &gt; Tanglewood , in Lenox , Mass. , summer home of the Boston Symphony and the most prestigious of U.S. music festivals . Besides the symphonies in Tanglewood 's 6,037-seat open-air shed this summer , there will be a week-long Festival of Contemporary American Music , - Music including four world premieres . <P> &gt; Music Barn , a resort just one-half mile from Tanglewood , where the top rock , folk and jazz artists perform in a converted stable . This season 's roster includes Pete Seeger , Thelonious Monk , Dave Brubeck , Lionel Hampton . <P> &gt; Jacob 's Pillow , near Lee , Mass. , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet , modern and ethnic dance in a barnlike theater . Twelve new works will be seen .
