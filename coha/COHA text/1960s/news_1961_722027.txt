txt Former Senator Herbert H. Lehman said yesterday that if Governor Rockefeller had any information he believed merited the censure or removal of Mayor Wagner he had a duty to make it public immediately .

Mayor Wagner has indicated that he prefers that the decision on a new Tammany leader be put off until after the November election . Elapse of Time Stressed In calling upon the Governor to issue any data reflecting on the Mayor , Mr. Lehman said : " I would feel that it would be a surprising thing that if any of these charges had any degree of validity ? and the hearings were held way back last June  --  that Governor Rockefeller would have held them up all this time . " It would be something that I 've never heard of a Governor doing . If there are charges that he believes merit censure or removal or anything of that sort , it is the duty of the Governor to make these public immediately . " Mayor Wagner , who is reported to have testified under oath before the state commission , brushed aside the allegations of the Tammany leader last week as " part of the De Sapio tactics  --  attacking myself and my family personally . " Mr. Lehman 's position , voiced on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord with Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz , the Republican mayoral candidate . Mr. Lefkowitz said last Friday that the S. I. C. had a duty to disclose information relating ) to the Mayor 's official conduct . Further , he said it was unfair to permit implications of wrongdoing to hang over the head of anyone .

" Mayor Wagner , " he noted , " has stated that he will serve out his term and I certainly do not think he will leave after one year . " Mr. Lehman said the Mayor 's record and his experience would be issues in the city election and added : " I think Mayor Wagner will prove , as I think he did during the primary , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has shown courage . And , in my book , there is nothing ' more important than courage . "
