" The professional critics will no doubt call this work eclectic , " said Leonard Bernstein , warming to one of his fireside chats from the podium of Manhattan 's Philharmonic Hall . " Very well . Here are the elements you may find : certainly Schoenberg , Mahler , perhaps Bartok . This is the music of a very eclectic man , and you should hear the passion of Spain , the worldliness of Vienna , the German methodology , the English love of tradition . " With that , New York Philharmonic Pianist Paul Jacobs sounded the first six notes of the tone row with a crashing force that introduced to the U.S. the haunting Symphony No. 1 of Spanish-Exile Composer Roberto Gerhard . When the final note was sounded by a lone violin , it was clear that the premiere had been long overdue . <P> Speed &; Excitement . Gerhard , 66 , fled Spain during the Civil War . Earlier he had studied with Schoenberg in Vienna and Berlin , but he decided to go to England and settled at Cambridge , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composer . " Teaching would have been safety-first , " he says , " a sign of lack of confidence to survive . " Instead , he adopted a hermit 's quiet and began turning out a blizzard of atonal music . The Symphony No. 1 , composed in 1953 , was not played publicly in England until last February , but it has already made Gerhard a major English succs d'estime . <P> Gerhard 's music is splashed with cliff-hanging melodies that grow out of his insistence that twelve-tone composition need not always be atonal . " There are alarming signs that composition with twelve tones may become a Cause , " he wrote while working on his symphony , then proved his freedom from causes by building his music on rhythmic patterns outlawed by the canons of serial technique . The First Symphony opens with a lively burst of serial figures , repeated over and over in headstrong violation of Schoenberg 's rules . Rushing excitement then gives way to the eerie calm of the second movement ; the science-fiction-thriller sound of Gerhard 's adagio strings led the admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerhard 's world " as excitingly mysterious as that of any space traveller . " <P> In the final movement , a race of violins and piano goes so fast that a second-chair man complained during rehearsals that it could not be played at all . " Wait till you get excited . " Bernstein said , and in last week 's performances , the movement came off beautifully . <P> Meat &; Poison . Gerhard has just completed a string quartet to add to the thick sheaf of compositions that has followed the First Symphony-another symphony , a concerto for harpsichord , strings and percussion , and a new work called Concert for Eight , which is scored for an accordion and seven instruments " masked " to produce odd sounds . He is totally unconcerned about the cool public reception his works usually find . When a listener cried " Rubbish ! " at the close of a Gerhard concert in England two years ago , Gerhard blithely said : " One man 's meat is another man 's poison , but I hope the man who thinks my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
