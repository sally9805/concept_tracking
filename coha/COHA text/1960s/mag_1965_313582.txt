People were beginning to whisper about Scotland 's Jimmy Clark , 28 . Two years ago he was the world 's No. 1 race-car driver-the Grand Prix cham pion , winner of a record seven races . In 1964 , it looked like the same story all over again when Clark won three out of the first five Grand Prix races . Then everything went wrong . <P> A broken valve cost him the German Grand Prix . A shaft snapped in Austria , a tire blew in the Indy 500 , an oil line burst in the Mexican Grand Prix after Clark had led for 64 of the 65 laps . Britain 's John Surtees won the 1964 Grand Prix championship ; Clark finished third . To top it off , he got into a friendly snowball fight in the Italian Alps last month , twisted his back , and wound up with a slipped disc . The experts wondered : Was Clark washed up ? <P> Cracking a Ton . They got their answer . Strapping himself into a surgical corset , Jimmy slid gingerly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's East London race track at 100.10 m.p.h. - the first time anybody had " cracked a ton " ( topped 100 m.p.h. ) on the tricky , twisting track . <P> A time trial and a race are two different things . The 210-mile South African Grand Prix was the first big race of the 1965 season ; 50,000 fans turned out to watch , and everybody who was anybody was there-Champion Surtees in his Ferrari ; Britain 's Graham Hill , the 1962 winner , in his B.R.M. ; Jack Brabham , 1959 and 1960 champion , in his own Brabham-Climax . But Clark 's practice lap had won him the pole position , and the starter 's flag barely fluttered before he shot into the lead . By the 13th lap , he was already lapping stragglers . Twice , he shattered the official track record , and on the 84th lap , he zipped around the 2.4-mile course in 1 min. 27.4 sec. to break it a third time-clocking 100.33 m.p.h . Smiled Lotus Designer Colin Chapman : " He must have an itch in his corset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line he sped , slowing almost to a stop when an official gave him the checkered flag of victory . In the pits , Chapman screamed and waved a sign with a big number 1 on it . The official had goofed : Clark still had a lap to go , and Surtees was closing in . Furious . Jimmy stomped down the throttle ; the Lotus snarled around the track once more , coasted into the pits-the winner by a comfortable 31 sec . " Imagine , " sighed an awed South African fan , " what Clark could do if he were feeling fit . " <P> With his Lotus finally functioning perfectly and nine points chalked up toward the 1965 Grand Prix championship , Clark quickly forgot the pain in his back . " It feels good to be back on top again , " he beamed . Come June , factory mechanics will replace his Lotus ' 195-h.p . V-8 Climax engine with a hush-hush 16-cylinder job that is supposed to have something of the same effect as gluing two of the old engines together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are simply picking up a bit more power , that 's all . "
