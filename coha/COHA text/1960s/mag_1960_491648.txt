They went to the shed where the cows were kept . The Reeces ' cow had a broken foreleg and would have to be destroyed . Their two cows were lyme in the shed in a welter of sand and stones , exhausted but still aloe . " I 'm going up to the Recces ' , " Cormac said to his wife . " I 'll come with you . " said Jackie .

Weed and rocks lay all crier the fields . There was not one stone wall left on the island , The stones of the walls had been flung into the hollows of the fields . which were full of ocean water w hipped by the wind . The wind was fitful and threw the two of them about as they struggled over the stone and seaweed on the fields . The ocean was still a writhing gray and white around the island , the waves running in many directions , flinging into each other with claps , which could be heard above the wind gusts . When they got to the top of the hill which overlooked the headland on which the Recces lived , they found that there was no house there .

Then the roof  --  and then the sea and the wind had conic in and killed the old man with the bent knees and the pointed chest and fits wife . There was no trace of either of them . and Cormac came back to his son . The boy had stopped crying , but was still staring at the ruins of the cottage as if he did not see it or did not believe what he saw . " He was not strong enough , " he said dully to his father . " He was strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island and he died on the island with his woman and in his own house . That is strength . " Four days later the seas calmed , and the Conneeleys returned . Pat Conneeley had not been able to get back when he took his children to the mainland because the coast guard had decided against returning with him . But now the sun shone , and the sea was blue again , and out in the ocean there was only a trace of spume around the Hags . Jackie went up the ruins of the boreen and found the place where Saint Bren dan 's well was . The well was full of weed and stones , and he started to clean it out . I-le had something to explain to the saint , and he thought that if he cleared out the well , the saint would be in a better humor to listen to him and would not be offended at what he had to say .

During one of these it was banned by law , and resived only because the addition of a tenth pin and change of the pin pattern from a diamond to a triangle circumvented the ban . The sport . however . has never before attained anything like its current height in number of players and alleys or the gradiose character of bowling establishments . This is the day of the million-dollar bowling palace , a social center of some respectability , offering a community 's best citizens not only a game but also shops , nurseries , meeting rooms and food and drink . The day is largely over when bowling alleys were often a basement adjunct of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 211 The seven-year-old miss , her schoolmates and her parents are not the cause of the bowling growth , but a product of it . Bowling first started jumping during and directly after the war . War-rich factory workers had no gasoline and often came off shifts at odd hours . Bowling alleys near such potential customers offered relaxation that was available at any time , in any weather . Bowling establishments that had formerly closed at definite hours simply stayed open as they were required , a habit that led to today 's very common twenty-four-hour operations . Several strong factors merged to keep this wartime rise from waning . The move to suburbia produced clusters of people who welcomed a community sports center and who had the money and leisure to make use of it . Then , in 1954 at Mount Clemens , Michigan , a most powerful influence appeared . A bowling establishment there installed completely automatic pin-setting machines on every alley , These machines did everything a pin boy used to do except ask for tips . They were never tardy or absent , reluctant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the setting up of pins . Complete automation meant that the bowling house could operate at capacity at all times if the proprietor could find the customers . It also meant that investors , with an important part of the business stabilized , could afford to risk considerably larger sums in new establishments . The size of an establishment , in fact , was no longer limited by pin-bob availability . This inevitably led to large and larger establishments . The American Machine and Found- , Company produced the first automate machines , which are rented to usca on a use rate . About three years law **25;1860;TOOLONG introduced machines which arc sold outright . The two companies compete bitterly , but cad ' recognized that the market for Ng products was firmly tied to the populaal of bowling . First A.M.F. and then Bruaa wick began what has been no less thant giant national promotion of bowling e5 a sport . The ( Continued en Page 7 ? ' 76 ( ( moused front Paw 7-ii promotion has li en no small part of the howling boom . fhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three major network television bowling programs and innumerable local shows . Clinics and exhibitions go into all corners of site country . If itI . oca , proprietor wishes to stage his o ? - ? promotion , he can draw from 100 - the stables of A N " and Brunsw , most of them as at 5100 an appearance . A . .11ese promotional took developed and as his facilities became more elite , the bowling proprietor w. ? canvass wider and wider ? for business . He could inv ails is hoots. the churches , industrial plants , fraternal and civic organizations , inviting them to form teams and leagues to use his handsome , new and respectable premises . In this way thi ? boss hug proprietor was propelled from his former status of saloon satellite to a role as substantial businessman and pillar of the community . Harold Weber . in seventeen sears as a bowling proprietor , has witnessed and been a part of this trtmsformation and growth . He now operates a typical product of that growth . All Star Lanes . Dempster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the important Promotion Committee of the Bon ling Proprietors Association of America , which represents 80 per cent of the commercial houses of the country . All Star Lanes is a thirty-four lane establishment worth more than 51,000,000 . It is a fully automatic house . with A.M.F.-leased machines clear across the deck  --  nearly 90 per cent of the country 's bowling houses are now automatic . All Star is a miniature community in itself . In addition to the howling lanes , it houses a billiard club restricted to members . a cocktail lounge , a bar and a meeting room which not only is used for assemblies of bowlers but also is available to any civic organization . All Star has a pro shop , a shoe-rental department . a children 's nursery , a combined sales counter and control center , and a restaurant which is leased to an outside operator . Weber has a staff of forty-four persons , many of them seasonal or part-time . They include his son . Martin K. Weber . a brisk young man who shares with Loretta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , All Star 's operational deviations from the average house are two . On Marty Weber 's decision the house does not sell bowling balls , although Marty himself is a qualified ball driller and fitter . He says , We have no big star resident here , and sooner or later every bowler blames his ball for scores with which he may be dissatisfied . if there is no big name around to tell him that the ball is all right , he blames the one who sold it to him . We prefer to shift that blame out of the house . " Also the All Star does not sell its own bowling shirts . This activity is given to Moe Shiffman , one of three All Star supervisory instructors . The bowling shirt , incidentally , is one of a curious family of bowling accessories that has sprung up with the sport . It is a sport shirt with a contest attached . Several shirtmakers offer prizes for unusual scores , if the bowler at the lime is wearing the maker 's brand of shirt . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slacks and shoes can pick up prizes in four figures . Harold Weber , a hard-working , energetic man who is bubbling with promotion ideas and has contributed many to the industry , concentrates on bringing bowlers into All Star . " Once they arc here , it is up to them to choose any addi tional services they need . We do not push anything but bowling . The bar , for example , is there . Our customers can use it if they like , but I am not operating a saloon . If I want to run a saloon , I 'll go somewhere else and open one . " It is not quite that casual . In attaining big-business size , bowling establishments have had the services of architects and designers , sometimes furnished by the manufacturers , who lay out a house with sharp attention to the traffic flow and Ilse best position along that flow to plant sales temptations , Since All Star is a modern house , now in its third season , it has been well planned not only for commercial operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance halls lies alongside the end alley and affords the visitor a vista across the thirty-four lanes , which are backgrounded by a black wall on which is hung a large metal abstract sculpture . Another such piece stands alongside the main outside street entrance . Both are by Abbott Pattison , Winnetka sculptor . The concealed part of a bowling establishment is behind the alleys . In an automatic house , as in All Star , this is a corridor of mechanical action . The bowling ball , rolling into the back curtain of the pit , triggers the machine , which then automatically-responds to the bowling situation . it will sweep the downed pins off the alley , and reset in their correct position any that are not downed , even if the first ball has moved them slightly off their spots . It will also reset all pins at the beginning of each new frame . The machine has only one mental block . It can not understand a game in which a spare is scored in the last frame and the bowler is entitled to one final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll , the machine waits for a second ball , as if the frame were in the middle of the game . and human help is needed . Someone must push a button . At least twenty pins are required to keep the machine functioning , since it fills the racks without waiting for supplies of pins to be swept from the alley . Pins are not a small investment ; a minimum supply for thirty-four-lane house costs $3500 . Weber owns his pins . but pin-maintenance companies also rent them . Along with its commercial success All Star has also experienced many of the problems common to bowling today . Weber had to light a zoning board to secure his present location , This is a common occurrence . Also , All Star is operating in an area that is oversupplied with lanes . Oversupply is not yet a common occurrence , but an overabundance of lanes in some localities has produced price wars . This is a point of contention between proprietors and equipment manufacturers . There is an industry formula for selling equipment to new bowling establishments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed per 1000 population within a square mile . a rule that varies with type of location and is sometimes ignored . The people who come to All Star are mostly suburbanites from Skokie and other of Chicago 's northwest suburbs , including Evanston . They till two parking lots , one of which is badly overcrowded in the busiest hours . Contrary to sonic of the newer bowling palaces , All Star has no open , sweeping approach to its structure , it stands directly on the corner of two streets , flush with the sidewalks . The structure is typical , arch-roofed and single story , but the identification signs are unusually subdued . " I promised the zoning board , " Weber says , " that I would take car traffic off the streets into my lots and would refrain from operating bright or flashing signs . Our All Star sign is fluorescent and glows under black light . I 'm nuts , and I admit it . I always want something different . " Weber is quite the contrary of nuts . His operation is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is often called upon as a consultant by establishments in trouble . Weber says flatly , and Howard Sechausen , executive director of the Bowling Proprietors Association of America , confirms that " no bowling establishment has ever latm immor ... 41111 gone bankrupt . " However , at the request of B.P.A.A , ihe firm of Ernst and Ernst recently completed an analysis of bowling operations at 255 establishments in this country . The report indicated a sharp downtrend in net profit during 1958 compared with the two previous years . It is claimed that while customers arc increasing , the construction of new alley beds is outrunning the increase in bowlers , resulting in a decline of net profits after taxes to 2.5 per cent , All Star 's linage , which is number of games bowled , runs 75 per cent higher than the average for its size category and more than double the average for all houses studied , ranging from four-lane to sixty-four-lane . All Star 's heavy linage is attributable to a high ratio of league bowling  --  organized competitive teams which bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very active promotional sense has gained him much of this business . He is rarely without a new idea . Recently he recommended formation ofa pregnant- women 's league . It was not a success . He knew it would not be , but it did call attention to bowling . A misfire in this same field which Weber did not quite expect was a closed-circuit television connection between the alleys and the nursery , with monitors between each two lanes . The theory was that mothers who had left tots in the nursery could keep track of them on television . The device was useless and was later removed . The bowling mothers , it developed , wanted a respite from the children , They preferred to leave the watching chore to the nursery supervisor . Bowling has a less narcotic quality than some other garnet , and a surprising number of current bowlers started playing casually , accidentally or just to be sociable . Take a pair of All Star league contestants , Neil Franklin and Wait Kahle . They are young engineers who work in a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bowl in an I.B.M . league . Franklin . who is single , had no interest in bowling . " I was dragooned into it , " he said . " The office wanted forty men , and not that many signed up , so I was either going to bowl or become unpopular . I bowled . And now I 'm glad of it . It helps to relax the tensions of my job . " Kahle shows no signs of needing relaxation , and in contrast to Franklin he wanted to bowl . He had always bowled a little , and the weekly league night offered him a harmless night out from his family . For Lily Reisman the sport has a much stronger attraction . Lily and her husband came to Skokie from Czechoslovakia ten years ago . She had never known the game before she joined the Parent-Teacher Association of East Prairie grammar school and was invited to join the P.T.A . league . She is fascinated by the sport , often seeks instruction from Dolores Stale , an All Star instructress. sometimes bowls by herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available . Dorothy Sugar , another East Prairie P.T.A . bowler , got into bowling through her hay fever . She got tired of seeking refuge from pollen at home and in air conditioned movies and turned to air-conditioned All Star Lanes for a change . She is a bowling proprietor 's dream  --  a summer bowler . Summer is bowling 's barren season . Two other young housewives , Peggy Carroll and Frances Rasps , bowl in the sizable St. Athanasius church league at a morning hour . They think the best part of bowling is the chance to get away from household and child cares . Straight male or female leagues arc the most common in bowling everywhere , but Weber has several mixed leagues . One of these is an evening league from the Evanston Golf Club . The Evanston club is large enough to provide a league of eight teams . Head of the bowling is Al Fenskc , who explains ; " In the summertime we are accustomed to playing golf and having an occasional drink with each other , and howling is one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One distinction of the Evanston league is that anyone who rolls a turkey  --  three strikes in a row  --  is entitled on the spot to kiss all team members of the opposite sex . Weber has church leagues from three major religious faiths , a weekly booking of handicapped children of which he is especially proud , and industrial and civic leagues . Northwestern University has used the lanes in shaping a bowling team . But the most picturesque leagues are the juveniles . They are probably also the most trouble , but they are salesmen to their parents and they comprise a hard core of future bowling business . The teams of youngsters are bracketed in two-year age periods , beginning from seven to nine years . It is Marty Weber 's job to alert the community to All Star 's preseason offer of a week 's free bowling instruction for young people and thereafter to organize those who decide to sign up . The charge is less than for adults , three games for 51 .25 , but only ninety-five cents of this is for bowling . Fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the season . The remaining fifteen cents goes to teen-age bowlers who handle the scoring for the youngest teams , help parents with discipline and , when it is needed , do a little coaching . The appearance of the seven-to-nines on Saturday morning is a spectacle of bowling pandemonium . The real small bowlers , thickly interlarded with parents , mill around , scuffle and squeal . Although some show budding signs of nice bowling swings , most show little kinship with the ball , the pins and the alley and not even a nodding acquaintance with the foul line . They deliver the ball standing , sitting , falling down and sliding , and no effort of any kind fails to bring cheers from the bench . Weber is fond of advising people that kids should be taken off the streets and put into the alleys . In this early-age category he must mean gutters , because that is where most of the balls go . On the first day of this season in September , Cynthia Richards , a tiny blonde , preceded her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing . But after being coaxed into rolling the first ball she thereafter ignored him . Roger Salzgeber , nine and one half years old and hence one of the more capable of the young group , became so upset by his mistakes that he offered his mother half his week 's allowance if she would leave . As Saturday progresses , ages , and scores , go up , parents disappear altogether and heavier balls appear  --  maximum is sixteen pounds . By midafternoon the top teen-agers , slick and well-coordinated , have taken over one end of the row of lanes , and birthday parties have crept into the other end . The latter bring back young and boisterous players . On the same opening day there were five parties in progress , with the largest occupying three lanes and fifteen children . Important as it is , juvenile bowling is the small end of the bowling busines . Women 's leagues are of much greater consequence , and men 's industrial and organization leagues most important of all . If there is a bar in the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men 's evening leagues is heightened . There is even a difference between a predominantly beer crowd and a mixeddrinks crowd . The latter is more profitable . Bowling proprietors have even been known to refuse bookings at the best hours for nondrinking leagues . The statistics , however , arc with Harold Weber in his concentration on bowling . Bowling receipts comprise 69 per cent of total receipts of an average house . Bar receipts tire the second source of income , but average only 15 per cent , and a restaurant is third in importance . Weber is below average in the restaurant item since he merely rents the restaurant quarters . Rental of bowling shoes , now an almost universal practice , has materially helped the bowling boom . Shoes rent for only twenty cents a pair , and income from this service , according to the Ernst and Ernst study , is only 2 per cent of art establishment 's receipts . All other categories are even less . Heaviest operating cost in a bowling house is for pinsetting , which , in All Star 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machines . This charge starts higher , but is reduced after 10,000 lines on each lane and again after 14,000 lines . Comparison with machines purchased outright is difficult . Purchased pinsetting machines cost a little more than the equivalent of five years of rental costs at the rate at which Weber operates his lanes , but volume and differences in interest cost and servicing charges have a bearing on the comparison . To the bowler , an evening 's entertainment is relatively inexpensive . Three games at the standard fifty cents a line is little more than a movie . The cost of outfitting for those who bowl often enough to want their own gear is considerably less than for golf . Shoes , bowling ball and carrying bag in fair quality can be had for about fifty dollars , of which the ball would represent half the total . There is a larger and larger money element in bowling as its popularity grows . Industrial plants with big employee leagues can build up prize pots in five figures by having bowlers chip in only about 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there have been several hundred cases of league treasurers absconding . All Star has its own banking system for leagues that bank their prize funds , and both balances and disbursements are subject to continuing confirmation and audit . The boom also has fostered a new and prosperous class of professional bowlers . Star bowlers cash in on a multitude of local and regional tournaments , maintain exhibition contracts with equipment makers , earn perhaps 8100 a week for affiliation with a top team , pick up endorsement money and perhaps win money on television contests  --  one winner collected $22,500 . The American Bowling Congress , which is the sixtyfour-year-old arbiter of howling 's rules and standards , conducts the largest of all annual tournaments , the A.B.C . In the last twenty years the A.B.C . prize money has never totaled less than $174,000 , and in 1953 , when the tournament was held in Chicago and drew an unusually large number of contestants , the prize pot was over $500,000 . Despite bowling 's new popularity , the alley beds themselves have undergone little change . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few feet and at the end where the timber crashes . In mid-alley the beds are commonly soft pine , which permits the bail to bite the surface and make effective whatever spin the howler has applied upon delivery . The pins are also still maple , although tough plastic now coats most of them and later may take over the whole pin . Ball returns have gone underground . and the ball has been forced to pass through a duster on its return . It then pops up , its speed checked , on racks between alleys . The existence of so large a number of tenpin players has had many effects on the bowling scene . One is the toppling of long-standing scoring records . However , the sport has not been changed so severely that pilot error has been eliminated . It is still a game in which a hairline shift of the ball can make a notable difference in the score , Witness the achievement of Ed Lubanski of Detroit last summer , In a television appearance at Miami , Lubanski , 1959 Bowler of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive perfect games of 300 each a feat that is almost unheard of in bowling history . But even Lubanski is human . which will be welcome news to hack bowlers . In the game preceding his two 300 games he , together with a Scotch doubles partner , rolled 149 , a duffer total . Moreover , the A.B.C . records are full of fantastic reversals of form in the annual A.B.C . tournament . Consider the bowler who once followed a superior game of 266 with a dreadful ninety-nine in the very next game . Or the bowler who followed a 205 game with a game of fifty-three that included eight gutter balls . And at times bowlers may rise to heroic heights . In 1958 the A.B.C . title winner , Ed Shay , came up to his final game needing 294 to win . He bowled 300 . The preceding year Bob Allen needed a last game of 296 to win . He rolled 298 . All Star , while it has held clinics and exhibitions , is not a tournament house and hence not a site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its better bowlers do win distinctions in regular play , however , and Weber provides them with trophies , arm-band awards and enrollment on an honor roll . There have been 300 games , all-spare games and Dutch 200 's , which are complete games of alternate spares and strikes . These also occur at other houses , but All Star was the site of one game which may never have been matched elsewhere . It was turned in by Billy Salzgeber , aged eight , the younger brother of the boy who tried to bribe his mother to leave . Billy rolled a game of ten , but he did it the hard way  --  one strike and eighteen balls in the gutter .
