In a season when paintings have grown large enough to require flatcars for easels , and brushstrokes have turned into mighty walls of color bright enough to divert low-flying aircraft , a Lilliputian touch is welcome . Such is the mark of Italy 's Gianfranco Baruchello , 41 , whose works seem painted with a brush one millimeter wide to produce meticulous yet mysterious images that float across glossy white panels like microbes creeping from an infested imagination . <P> " Painting is my language , " says Baruchello , son of an Italian lawyer . Neither pop nor op , his vocabulary is intellectual , full of hints-a Proustian complex of personal remembrance . And he inscribes his nib 's nuances as if they were the scientific jiggling track of his own electroencephalograph . " To throw a pot of paint at a canvas is not my language , " he says . " Images are like sounds-complicated . We communicate in complicated sounds . I communicate in com plicated images . " <P> He refuses to supply a dictionary for his thickly poetical paintings , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ekstrom Gallery . At a quick glance , they seem like wall scribblings , or graffiti , which suggest the vocabulary of dreams . A tryptich entitled High Plateau of Uncertainty is complete with contours numbered to indicate altitudes . <P> Another theme is labeled Inferiority Complex . And the tiny images that speckle these works are ciphers but also reference points dotted on the topography of his own thoughts . A cartoon imitation of a World War I biplane suggests war ; corsets and garter belts spell out the paraphernalia of lust ; a woman 's pelvis is decorated with the design of a jet engine . " The life force , " says Baruchello , " is supplied with fuel from two reservoirs-love and fear . " <P> <P> His work is surreal , finicky , and owes much to Dada . Baruchello has even done a portrait , titled Chemical Inducers in Marcel Duchamp 's Brain , of that venerable , revamped Dadaist . Painted on three layers of Plexiglas , the portrait is a phrenologist 's delight , with arrows depicting the flow of nervous energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strewn through Baruchello 's work , it is the facsimile of an artist 's mind .
