Dr. Maxwell Lewis Rafferty flew to Los Angeles and called a news conference at a downtown hotel . Facing a roomful of expectant radio , television and newspaper reporters , the California Republican candidate for the United States Senate put it simply : " We candidates have a duty , as the kids say , to cool it . " This was a switch for Rafferty who , since he gained national prominence=or notoriety  --  has made full use of his 400 considerable flair for personal invective , unhampered by any nagging doubts of his own rectitude . But now , reviving a phrase used by the " old Nixon , " Rafferty told the newsmen he detected a deplorable tendency among political candidates to " go for the jugular . " By pat coincidence , he singled out for his concern one candidate in particular , Alan Cranston , the 54-year-old liberal Democrat who opposes him for the Senate . Rafferty accused Cranston of contributing to the " brooding climate of violence " and thereby risking the danger of stimulating further assaults on public figures , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rafferty added , almost by reflex , " I could say all kinds of things about my opponent , but I will not . " ( Laughter . ) Apparently , Cranston had contributed to the " brooding climate of violence " by replying to Rafferty 's attacks , instead of ignoring them , as Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel had done when battling Rafferty in the Republican.primary . It turned out that Kuchel had made a fatal political misjudgment . As an example of the kind of restraint he practices on his opponents , Rafferty later in the campaign charged that Cranston had moved " perilously close to . . . treason " when he urged a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam . For the past six years , since he was first elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction in California , Rafferty had said " all kinds of things " about personalities and issues ; his current popularity , like that of George Wallace , may tell more about the country than it reveals of the man . The stakes in the Senate battle are high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backdrop of ' war abroad , war in our streets and general confusion and rancid conflict , the conservative tide that elected Gov . Ronald Reagan and Sen. George Murphy is still running in California and may not have reached its peak . The national significance of political trends in California is obvious . The state 's economy is now so large that some statisticians claim it would rank , if separated from the rest of the United States , fifth among the nations of the world ' . Rafferty makes headlines and catches the eye of the teleVision camera with short , staccato bursts of opinion like the following : On Vietnam : " If the North Vietnamese do not respond to a seven-day ultimatum on the 1 peace talks then we should turn our objectives over to the military to achieve . " On draft resisters : " Creeps , cowards , Communists . " ( In World War II , Rafferty appealed his 1-A classification twice and finally was rejected for flat feet . ) On foreign aid : " It 's not my fault there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has always been starvation in Asia , largely because the Asiatics insist upon breeding like rabbits . " On riots : " I would favor declaring martial law immediately in any riot zone , and provide for military courts-martial to deal with rioters and looters right on the streets . " On crime and punishment : " I 've had it up to here with sob sisters who insist we should be kind to creeps who prey on us or punks who stamp helpless polio victims to death . " On students ( at Berkeley ) ; " Who pays the tuition for their four-year course in sex , drugs and treason ? I will tell you . You and I do . " Max Rafferty is a political accident , but that may be said of many politicians . Richard Nixon , this generation 's most pragmatic practitioner of the art , says a politician 's ' greatest asset is being in the right place at the right time . With no advance warning to the state or notice to him , fate shoved Rafferty from relative obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational system in the nation . Six years later he had knocked out of office the 57-year-old Kuchel , a veteran of fifteen years in Washington , minority whip of the Senate and a ' man who had never before been defeated in thirty-two years of politics . Rafferty was born in New Orleans fifty-one years ago and moved with his family to California in 1931 . He graduated from Beverly Hills High School at 16 , a bright product of the educational system he has so incessantly attacked . He graduated ' from UCLA with a degree in history and took an M.A. in school administration , but the clue to the future Rafferty can be found in UCLA student politics ' of thirty years ago : He-was an ardent member of a group- called UCLA Americans , organized to rid the university of " Communist activities . " Stanley Rubin , editor of the college paper , The Daily Bruin , and now a Hollywood movie producer , told David Shaw of the Long Beach Independent Press-Telegram : " I remember he got so angry over an editorial I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his ROTC.uniform and boots , looking every bit like a storm trooper . He had two- big football players with him , and they said they were going to beat the hell out of me . " After returning to UCLA in 1939 to pick up teaching credentials , Rafferty disappeared into the Mojave Desert , where he began his career as a football coach and English instructor in a small-town high school . While working his way slowly up through the system 's bureaucracy , he obtained a doctorate in education from the University of Southern California . In 1952 , when Rafferty sought to become principal of a new high school in San Bernardino , he was rejected by the superintendent , who recalls : " I .. . heard stories about how he criticized football officials so vehemently that he whipped the crowds into a frenzy , and the officials were so frightened they ran from the field and drove off right after the games without stopping to shower and change clothes . " Rafferty 's later political opponents know how those officials felt . ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly always too hot to bother about anything , was having -a brawl over " progessive education . " The town , a Santa Fe Railroad preserve with a solidly unionized working class , rallied behind the " three Rs " and threw out the entire school board ; the school superintendent and three principals resigned . Rafferty was brought in as the new superintendent to restore order . He did that and more . One newspaper commented that , after five years of Rafferty , the school children of Needles were getting " one of the best public educations in the state . " Shortly thereafter he was called to La Canada , a wealthy Los Angeles suburb which had been through a school unification fight with the usual casualties and was looking around for a new superintendent . And there , in the spring of 1961 , Rafferty became famous . He had not yet unpacked-when the , school board president asked him whether he would like to address a public meeting . He would , he - did , and ' became the leader of the right-wing ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Passing of the Patriot " seven years ago , but it is still included in his standard campaign kit . One redolent passage from this celebrated declamation reads : " The results of our system , of public education are plain for all to see . the worst of our youngsters growing 401 up to become booted , side-burned , duck-tailed , unwashed , leather-jacketed slobs whose favorite sport is ravaging little girls and stamping polio victims to death ; the best of our youth coming into maturity for all the world like young people fresh from a dizzying roller-coaster ride , with everything blurred , with nothing clear , with no positive standards , with everything in doubt . No wonder so many of them welsh out and squeal and turn traitor when confronted with the grim reality of Red military force ' and the crafty cunning of Red psychological warfare . " Referring thus to the behavior of some captured American soldiers during the Korean War , Rafferty did not men-lion that their average level of education was ninth grade and did not remind his middle-class audience that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omissions mattered not at all to the legions of the Right , disgruntled by recent setbacks at the polls . They whooped it up for the superintendent , and soon he was booked into every light-wing rally in the state . Rafferty 's sudden acclaim could not have happened at a time more propitious for him . Dr. Roy E. Simpson , State Superintendent of Public Instruction , was retiring in 1962 , and the ultraconservatives knew opportunity when they saw it . Easily persuaded to become their candidate , Rafferty won the nonpartisan office by outtalking a UCLA professor of speech , Ralph Richardson . " He clubbed me to death with the progressive education issue , " Dr. Richardson says , " even though progressive education had not been used in California in ten years . " After his election by 200.000 votes , while Richard Nixon was losing to Gov . Edmund G. Brown , ' Rafferty consolidated his hold on public attention with nonstop oratory . His themes were the war , uprisings in the ghettos , student riots , pornography and narcotics , often bundled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafferty has not been a disaster for education in California ; indeed , he has not had much effect on it . EVen if he had been utterly convinced by his own rhetoric  --  which , given his intelligence , is not likely  --  he would have found it difficult to accomplish radical change . The Superintendent of Public Instruction in California , while an elected official , is the administrative officer of the Board of Education , appointed by the governor ; his power is limited . And in Rafferty 's case , nine of the ten board members had endorsed his opponents in 1962 . ( Since 1966 , Governor Reagan has appointed six new members who are more closely akin to Rafferty 's philosophy . ) Of the twenty-seven changes Rafferty advocated in 1962 for California education , nineteen , he says , have been adopted  --  a phenomenal record . But a closer reading suggests , as one observer put it , that most of the reforms are - " sweetly scented with anti-climax . " They range from " an end to progressive education as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " production by the State Department of Education of recommended lists of children 's classics to be sent to all elementary and junior high schools . " Among others : " Adoption of music textbooks containing such patriotic songs as Columbia the Gem of the Ocean , You 're a Grand Old Flag , and Yankee am Doodle Boy . " These are listed under the category , " Education in Depth  --  a California Revolution . " Some of the reforms have more substance . Rafferty shifted control of teacher training from the school of education in each state college to the Liberal Arts and Science Departments . In teacher training , he placed more emphasis on subject matter and less on methodology . He obtained extension of free public education to the mentally retarded and sponsored compensatory education for dropouts , and he has consistently pressed for more state aid for local schools and a consolidation of school districts to cut costs and increase efficiency . These moves hint that the new superintendent had something of the " sound educational philosophy " credited to him by one critic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlays this philosophy " with Philistine attitudes and ideological views that are irrelevant to the battle for basic education . " But Rafferty 's " Philistine attitudes and ideological views " were not irrelevant to his career . Once settled in office , he troubled himself far less with problems of education than with national and international affairs . Exceptions were emotion-packed , news-making episodes like the row stirred up by The Dictionary of American Slang , a volume comprehensive enough to include most of the more uninhibited sexual expressions . This book found its way into school libraries , and Rafferty denounced it as " a practicing handbook of , sexual perversion . " He condemned the Supreme Court for its decision on prayers in public schools and is currently attacking the appointment of Eldridge Cleaver as a guest lecturer in a special course on racism at the University of California at Berkeley . There is no evidence that Rafferty cared very deeply about such issues , but they were useful to him as political steps to higher office . When he announced for the Senate ? appropriately on Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the record should have prepared them . And the time was ripe . In the spring of 1968 , Senator Kuchel , an easygoing moderate of 57 and a product of the Earl Warren era of tranquillity in California , was vulnerable . Kuchel , when other politicians were discreetly silent , had earned the enmity of the hard-core Right by denouncing the John Birch Society for its attacks on Chief Justice Warren , who had appointed him to the Senate in 1953 . The Senator slammed the point home by refusing to support Barry Goldwater , Sen. George Murphy and later Governor Reagan when they declined to repudiate the society . Governor Reagan 's pulsating dislike of Senator Kuchel , whom he tagged by inference during the Goldwater campaign as one of the " traitors " to the Republican Party , was well known . But as Reagan 's staff began to persuade him that he had a chance for the GOP Presidential nomination , the Governor began to think more of party unity and less of ideology . Trying to prevent a Right-liberal split in the California Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator would go along with Reagan 's ambitions and Reagan would remain neutral in the primary . Reagan kept his end of the deal , rather effectively , it appears , blocking financial support for Rafferty THE NATioN/October 21 , 1968 from the wealthiest of the conservatives who had financed his own victory over Brown . That turned out not to matter very much . Rafferty 's campaign manager , Dick Darling , reported that $950,000 rolled into the primary campaign from 73,000 individual contributors . Rafferty spent $135,000 more in the primaries and plans to spend $1.5 to $2 million  --  if he can raise it  --  against Cranston . In October , money , unexpectedly , became a problem . It was reported that big GOP contributors , watching Rafferty sag in the post-primary opinion polls , were not returning his telephone calls with much zest . Rafferty 's unctuous oratory may offend the sensibilities of moderates , but he can stir up the faithful to a pitch of fervor . After one of his window-rattling jousts against vice , crime and the Supreme Court , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little strong , did n't he ? " A sweet-faced , middle-aged woman who had been listening with palpitating attention turned on the lawyer : " He 's a great man , a fine man , an honest man who tells the truth . " The lawyer , embarrassed by her insistence , nodded agreeably , but she would not be put aside . " Do you know , " she asked him , " what 's happening in our schools ? They put on plays there , with Negro and white children kissing each other . " Rafferty is adept at playing on the fears of such people , but he was not elected and re-elected superintendent of schools solely by bigots , nor did he win over Senator Kuchel with the aid only of the embattled Right . He got heavy support from the middle class and cut deeply into blue-collar areas that ' have been traditionally Democratic . The concerns that motivate the supporters of Rafferty , Reagan and Nixon are the basic concerns of everybody : the inconclusive war in Vietnam , riots in the ghettos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , big taxes , big spending  --  and circling over all this the terrifying pace of change that threatens established institutions and inherited values . " Something has gone wrong with this country , " says Dick Darling , a bedrock conservative . " There is a break- : down in morality , a lowering of all standards . Loyalty to family , friends and country no longer count for anything . The pendulum has swung too far toward the welfare state . This irritates the average citizen . " But Darling , an affable real estate man from Riverside , claims some sympathy for the New Left rebellion against " the system . " The New Left , as he sees it , is currently making the mistake that the Goldwater conservatives made four years ago : " Four years ago we were too extreme . We would argue , but we would not reason . The same people who worked for Goldwater worked for Reagan , but they were tempered by their Goldwater experience . " Darling 's sympathy for the New Left , held carefully within bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " liberal establishment . " ( As Cranston gathered strength , Rafferty dropped Darling , called Reagan for help , and Reagan sent in a rescue squad of his top aides . ) Darling 's average citizen , whoever he is , may be only irritated , but a strong current of fear , frustration and hatred is coursing through the country . These emotions surface more readily on the Left and ' the Right , but it is apparent that the great majority of the voters ? Richard TEL NATION/October 21 , 1968 Scammon 's " unpoor , the unyoung , and the unblack " ? also are beginning to , respond . The right-wing appeal in traditional working-class districts has been evident for several years . In an area of southeastern Los Angeles County with a 63 per cent Democratic ' registration advantage , Governor Reagan beat Governor Brown by nearly 2 to 1 two years ago , and George " Wallace is strong there . The residents of the area , 94 per cent white , and heavily unionized , voted 5 to 1 to repeal California 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro neighborhoods of south-central Los Angeles . In some respects , the blue-collar class  --  workers g6tting $6,000 to $10,000 a year  --  are as alienated as the ideological Left and Right . The ' causes are not hard to discover . A professional campaign manager in Los Angeles , mapping an appeal to traditional working-class Democrats , found workers " fed up " with higher taxes , inflation , the war and fear of " encroaching Negroes and violence . " As he said , " taxes hit them harder than anyone else , more of their sons go to war , and integration makes heavier psychological demands on them than on the better educated . Most of them ca n't afford to send their kids to college , and yet every night on television they see the middle-class kids rioting on the campus and chanting ' Ho Chi Minh . ' " In appealing to the discontented , whatever the origin of their anger , Max Rafferty stirs up fear with one hand and ' ladles out flattery with the other . " I 'm here to say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began in typical fashion recently to a receptive dinner audience of young businessmen and their wives . The phrases fell neatly into place : " We are accused of the terrible crime of being American . " On the war : " Do n't 403 blame our government for the suffering in the villages of Vietnam . We are there only because they begged us to come . " On racial outbreaks : " Do n't blame me . I 'm not a sniper , a looter or a burner . " On poverty : " I did not cause it . You did not cause it . " On the Supreme Court : " Social reformers , political hacks , child-marrying mountain-climbers . " The innocents of the world , it seems are the comfortable middle classes . A man less talented than Rafferty would have had difficulty converting mild Senator Kuchel into a great " sick ' 60s " symbol of pornography , dope , violence and lawlessness , but Rafferty accomplished it in this way : " Washington . . . is a place for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obedience to the Constitution and our laws . . . . I leave you to decide whether my opponent is this kind of Senator  --  whether he has ever been this kind of Senator . " And further , " I can not tell you why my opponent has n't led a Senatorial campaign against dope ; I can only tell you that I will . " This was overkill , and while Rafferty defeated Kuchel , his margin was only 69,000 in a vote of more than 2 million . Alan Cranston hopes to pick up a large slice of the nearly Million votes that Kuchel received , and the polls show that he may . Former Governor Brown predicts : " Many Republicans are so mad at Rafferty for what he did to Kuchel , that they will vote for Cranston . " Cranston is assiduously cultivating the anti-Rafferty reaction among Kuchel supporters and the results are beginning to show . " Max Rafferty , you 're guilty of another big smear .

She was formerly vice chairman of the Republican State Central Committee , director of the California Federation of Republican Women , and served as Women 's Co-Chairman for Sen.

" What upset Mrs. Sherry was Rafferty 's delightful invention that Kuchel had voted to give U.S. financial aid to China to build steel mills . Sanford Weiner , a professional campaign director who before has always handled Republican campaigns , is now working for Cranston . Weiner explains , " Rafferty 's election would destroy any chance to elect a moderate Republican in California for years . " Cranston , a moderate much like Kuchel , was a founder of the liberal California Democratic Council fifteen years ago . In later years , as an influential Democrat and twice- 404 elected state controller , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the roster of its current heroes . Two years ago , Cranston collaborated with Governor Brown to force Simon Casady out as CDC president , although both had supported him for the post . Casady was guilty of prematurely opposing the war in Vietnam , and his taunting attacks on President Johnson became an embarrassment to the party in an election year . Cranston 's credentials predate the CDC by many years . As a foreign correspondent in Germany , he early recognized the significance of the rise of Hitler . He compared the German-language edition of Mein Kampf with the watered-down propaganda version distributed in the United States , and on returning from Europe in 1939 edited a new version that followed the original text . The book sold half a million copies in two weeks , after which the courts stopped the sale-by ruling that Cranston had infringed the copyright . During World War II , Cranston became chief of the foreign language division of the Office of War Information , later resigning to enter the Army . After the war , he wrote The Killing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of Nations . The New York Times called the book one of the ten best of the year . Before returning to California to enter politics , Cranston held two important nongovernment posts in Washington . He headed the Common Council for American Unity , organized to reform immigration and naturalization laws , and was president of United World Federalists . Cranston suffers from some of the same disadvantages that plagued Kuchel . A political sophisticate , tall , bald and a little glum looking on television , he has difficulty competing for public attention against a bouncy , graying Rafferty with the hearty good looks of an Irish cop . Cranston advocates an immediate bombing halt in Vietnam and urges de-escalation of the war , but maintains that the United States " ca n't cut and run out of Vietnam . " He is for law enforcement combined with " tangible help " for the ghettos . These propositions are not easy to match against Rafferty 's simplistic decisiveness , but Cranston , after watching Kuchel go down , decided nevertheless that he had to carry the fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " My opponent says the answer to violence . abroad and violence at home is more violence . He advocates revenge and retribution . I advocate reason and reconciliation . " Three Southern California counties ? Los Angeles , with 40 per cent of the state 's population , Orange and San Diego  --  are where the action is . In beating Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 California primary , Barry Goldwater lost forty-four of the state 's fifty-eight counties , but piled up a plurality of 134,000 votes in Los Angeles , Orange and San Diego Counties to carry , California by 68,000 . The Rafferty-Kuchel outcome was markedly similar . Rafferty lost forty-three counties to Kuchel , but amassed a lead of 218,000 votes in Los Angeles , Orange and San Diego to win state-wide by 69,000 . Goldwater went on to disaster and Cranston 's backers hope that Rafferty will meet a similar fate . They have history on their side , if history counts for anything this year . In California politics , the winner of a divisive primary struggle loses in November . THE NATION/ @ @ @ @
