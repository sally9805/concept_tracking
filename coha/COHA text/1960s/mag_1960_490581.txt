Notes and Comment THESE are hard times for the layman . He is no longer thought competent to work out his own opinions on many matters , even many that touch him intimately . His very survival has become the property of committees and the subject of learned argument among specialists . He has little to say in the affair , poor fish , being largely ignorant of the information upon which plans for him are based . He can only suppose that the experts know their business , and this sometimes requires a deal of faith . Consider a personal instance . Whenever an air-raid drill is conducted in our building , we descend from our office , on the nineteenth floor , to the corridors of the tenth floor , where we huddle with other baffled laymen . Someone , evidently , has figured out that the tenth floor is proof against explosions . Everything above this floor might he vaporized and everything below it smashed to rubble , but the flour itself , and all its grateful occupants , would waft gently down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wish we had more faith in it . And we can not help feeling the same reluctantly doubtful way about the recent recommendation of the New York State Committee on Fallout Protection . This studious body has urged the legislature to make a fallout shelter mandatory in every home in the state by July 1 , 1963 . Each householder would be required to stock his shelter with enough food to keep the occupants nourished for two weeks , by the end of which time , it is hoped , they might safely venture out . The idea , according to the Committee , is that such a program would " provide a powerful deterrent to the unleashing of an attack . " We wonder if it would . It seems to us that a citizen can do little to win a war while crouching in his basement And , from everything we hear , any future war will be decided long before he has opened his last can of beans . We would feel more confident and hopeful if the money required by the shelter program  --  which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to raise a generation wise enough to preserve a difficult peace . Although we are admittedly ignorant in the matter of megatons and roentgens , we can not help doubting whether any shelter , however stuffed with canned goods , could really mitigate the horror of another war . Besides , speaking strictly for ourself , we have no ambition to outlive the world . Paper E dote on success stories , especial- ly when the hero is one of those old-fashioned American go-it-aloners who , starting from scratch , or maybe even a little behind scratch , manage to turn a bent for homely invention into tens of millions of dollars and then have a marvellous . time making more inventions and more millions . We met a hero of this description a couple of weeks ago ; his fortune is based on his being the founder and proprietor of the largest individually owned construction company in the world , with over a hundred million dollars ' worth of building contracts currently in hand , but it began with inventions he made in his early youth , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has devised ways of building houses of paper , submarines of concrete , and trailers with swimming pools , and lives in a fantastic pleasure dome in Beverly Hills , wherein carpets slide up over the windows at the push of a button ( protection against imploding glass in the Atomic Age ) and lights go on and off if you simply tell them to . This paragon 's name is Hal B. Hayes , and our talk with him took place in the course of one of his periodic flying visits to this city  --  truly flying , for Hal B. Hayes-Contractor , Inc. , projects arc scattered over the continent , and he spends much of his time in the air , darting from one job to another and keeping close tabs on the day-to-day activities of his ten thousand-odd employees . A trim , good-looking bachelor of forty-eight , with bright-blue eyes , graying hair , and the quizzical expression of a man who longs to be asked to solve impossible problems , Hayes was horn and raised in Lenoir , a small town in western North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hard times during the depression , and at seventeen young Hal lit out for California . Starting as a timekeeper for a construction company in San Francisco , he had risen to general superintendent within a year , and was ready to quit and become his own master . Already he was preoccupied with the notion of building houses cheaply , on assembly-line principles ; in those days he was concentrating on reinforced concrete , and by his middle twenties he had invented and patented a dozen or more devices  --  collapsible steel forms , and cranes and other tools for moving heavy weights  --  by means of which he was able to erect finished houses of precast concrete in a matter of days , By the time he was thirty , he had built hundreds of such houses throughout southern California , had made his first trifling million or so , had brought sizable chunks of the Hayes family West to join him , and had received the supreme accolade of a writeup by Dale Carnegie . " Once , as a stunt for Life , I put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furnishings , and landscape gardening , in thirty-four minutes , " he told us . " I 've always been a great one for doing things fast . I still am . " Mr. Hayes started experimenting with concrete ships during the Second World War ; nothing came of them at the time , but he is at present negotiating with a European government for the construction of a number of cargo-carrying concrete submarines . He claims that , given a big enough order , he could turn out concrete submarine hulls five hundred feet long and fifty feet in diameter at the rate of one every five minutes . Almost as dazzling is the speed with which he can turn out paper houses . " My associates and I have developed a new kind of plastic-impregnated paperboard , " he said . " It 's far stronger and cheaper than any other composition hoard on the market  --  so strong that we can build houses of it without rafters , sheathing , roof shingles , studding , bracing , or any of half a dozen other conventional structural members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roof over a frame , as the cables of the George Washington Bridge are draped on its towers , then staple it and the side walls to the frame with a giant rotary stapling machine . In a few hours , we produce a shelter that is tight , well insulated , weatherproof , rotproof , and vermin-proof , and good for decades of hard use . And cheap ! We estimate that in this country we could build a five-room house for about four thousand dollars if the unions and building codes would only let us try . But since the unions do n't want us to render their methods obsolete overnight , we 're not likely to get our way here for a long time , That 's one reason we 're making paper trailers ; they escape the building codes , because they 're not houses , hut on the site they unfold from a unit ten feet wide , forty-four feet long , and eight feet high into a four-bedroom house with kitchen , bathroom , and wood-burning fireplace . The swimming pool , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even brighter at a prospect they seemed to glimpse somewhere just past our left shoulder . " 1 , Vith our paperboard , adequate shelter everywhere in the world becomes an economic possibility for the first time , " he said . " We 're starting an international company to make the stuff abroad . In most countries , the ordinary building materials and methods put proper housing out of the reach of the mass of people . Our hoard can be made from the poorest pulpwood imaginable . There 's enough quick-growing pulpwood in the Amazon Valley alone to let us rehouse the whole world every ten years . I would n't he a hit surprised if by the year 2000 half the people on earth were living in paper houses . " We had a parting question for Mr. Hayes . Was it true that the lights in his house in Beverly Hills went on and off at the sound of a voice ? He nodded . " You just say ' On ' for on and ( Off ' for off , " he said .

L ' , VER Y Washington 's Birthday , Yale , mother of men , invites her innumerable progeny to return to New Haven , attend classes and sports events , have lunch in Commons , listen to a speech by President Griswold , and otherwise partake of the privileges and splendors of undergraduate life . ( If the chase has a beast in view , and if the beast is bigger contributions to the Alumni Fund , what 's the harm in that ? There are few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in giving money to his alma mater . ) This year , Alumni Day was devoted in large part to paying homage to Yale authors , living and dead  --  not Yale authors of books of history , economics , paleontology , and the like , of whom there have been so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up , to say . nothing of honoring them , but Yale authors of belles-lettres , of whom , over the past two hundred and fifty-nine years , the college has produced an astonishingly high number , from such early birds as Jonathan Edwards , class of 1720 , and James Fenimore Cooper , class of 1806 , to such comparative late-comers as Sinclair Lewis , class of 1907 , and Philip Barry and Stephen Vincent Benet , both class of 1919 . Living Yale authors had been invited to come hack and he made much of , and though many of the most distin-guished  --  among them Archibald Mac-Leish , class of 1915 ; Thornton Wilder , class of 1920 ; and John Hersey , class of 1936 ? apparently had other fish to fry , some thirty Yale poets and novelists turned up , enjoyed a preprandial glass of sherry with the president , shared a fine roast-beef lunch with sev teal hundred fellow-alumni , attended a pro-fessorial colloquium on Yale writers that was addressed by Robert Penn Warren , Charles Fenton , and Cleantli Brooks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where samples of their works , and of the works of two hundred and seventy other Yale authors , were on dis-play . In the line of duty , we attended both lunch and reception , and if we have any generalization to make , it is that the authors present looked more like Yale men than they did like au-thors . At lunch , President Griswold called on all writers everywhere to show the rest of us the way to a better world ( " This way to the Egress , " we thought , and were sad to recall that P. T. Barnum was n't an Old Blue ) , and at the reception he noted with regret that while he was an author  --  among his books are " Farming and Democracy " and " Essays on Education "  - -  he was n't a belletrist , and had therefore been denied any part of the day 's honors . The first genuine helletrist we came on was Mr. Harold Gulliver , of the class of 1916 . A resident of Valdosta , Georgia , and the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gulliver told us that Valdosta had been mighty good to him ; though poets are thought to be moody souls , given to solitary ways , his home town had seen to it that he was elected president of the local Rotary Club and commander of the local post of the American Legion . Our next literary lion proved to be Mr. John Knowles , of the class of 1949 , whose contribution to letters , a novel entitled " A Separate Peace , " is only just coming off the press . ( The earliest book on display in the library was Jonathan Edwards ' " Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God . " The latest was " A Separate Peace . " Conclusions were drawn . ) Mr. Knowles confessed that he 'd recently been trying his hand at haiku . " They look so easy , " he said , as many a tyro of haiku has said before him . Up came Mr. John Leggett , of the class of 1942 , whose novel " Wilder Stone " is on the best-seller lists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Yale had had any influence on his novel . He thought hard . " In a negative way , perhaps , " he said . " Wilder Stone did n't go to Yale , but he wished he had . " Our promising tote4i-tete with Leggett was broken into by a thickset author named Roswell Ham , Jr. , of the class of 1941 , who told us that his third novel , " A Peak in Darien , " is scheduled for publication this summer . Mr. Ham turned out to be that very rare creature , a self-confident author . " My book 's a social satire about commuters , " he said , " and , believe me , it 'll put the man in the gray flannel suit in his grave . I advise you to read it . Get it at a library , or go to England , where you can buy it cheaper , or wait till it comes out as a paperback , but read it ? A. Peak in Darien . ' " We swore we 'd remember the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Papa - knows- best . A gentleman tells us that he recently bought a suit at Brooks Brothers and , after wearing it a time or two , decided that the trousers were somewhat longer than he liked and a bit too wide at the cuff . The next day , he packed them down to the store and explained the matter to a flue : there . The fitter made the necessary diagnostic measurements . The trousers were , he agreed , a trifle long  --  perhaps as much as an inch . He would see that they were properly altered . But there was nothing to be done about the width . " Your cuff is now exactly eighteen inches , " he said . " And eighteen inches is our minimum , sir . We 're not allowed to make trousers any narrower than that . " Double E ran a piece in this department a while hack on the history of fingerprinting and managed , to the surprise of some of our readers , not to mention the name of Bertillon , who is often thought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingerprints . The fact is that bertillonnage is , or was , another system of identification altogether , based on a standard set of measurements ( the skull , the left forearm , the left foot , height , arm reach , and so on ) ; it preceded fingerprinting as a method of identifying criminals , and in its heyday , toward the end of the last century , it was considered every bit as infallible as fingerprinting is today . Rertilionnage was the brain child of Alphonse Bertillon , a French anthropologist who was born in 1853 and died in 1914 . The astonishing coincidence that led to its abandonment by police and prison authorities in this country occurred in 1903 , at the federal prison in Leavenworth . A new prisoner by the name of Will West was being measured according to the Bertillon system , and a clerk in the prison office thought he recognized the man as a criminal named William West , who had passed that way some time before , and when the clerk checked the files , he found that William West had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , on checking the records further he was dumfounded to discover that William West was obviously another person , for he was at that very moment in a cell in Leavenworth . The two men were hastily brought together ; the resemblance between them was so strong that they might have passed for twins , and when they were both remeasured , their Bertillon measurements proved to he identical . To heighten the coincidence , in spite of the fact that they happened to have nearly the same name , they were not even distantly related . Bertillonnage never recovered from this blow , while fingerprinting profited by it , for though Will West and William %Vest were otherwise almost indistinguishable , their fingerprints were substantially different . What is the likelihood that dactyloscopy will someday suffer the same fate as bertillonnage ? Well , someone has estimated that under the Henry system of classification  --  the one used in this country and throughout most of Europe  --  the chances of two people 's having even a single fingerprint in common are roughly one in sixty-four billion , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ten , fingerprints in common are something like one in two hundred and fifty trillion , so everybody can stop worrying . Realism AN art teacher we know , who deals with local first-grade students , has sent us a report on a little girl who handed in a rather competent crayon drawing of a boy running after a dog . Particularly eye-catching were wisps of black smoke that curled from the boy 's and the dog 's heads . The teacher , remcmbering her two semesters of child psychology at college , gently worked up to the question of the smoke . " Oh , it 's a diesel boy , " the little girl explained , " chasing a diesel dog . " Sportsman OUR man Stanley , his face somewhat ruddier than usual , turned up in the office the other day wearing hip hoots and a red-checked wool shirt , asked us to feel the biceps of his right arm , and deposited the following dispatch : " Walked briskly over to Coliseum on cold , gray , penetrating day last week to National Outdoor Exposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim excess blubber , oil up the old machine , get in a spot of exercise .
