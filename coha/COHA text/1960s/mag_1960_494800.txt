Walter Z , Laqueur Caucasian Diary The jet age has not yet reached the Caucasus . It takes 54 hours by train from Moscow to get there , or 7 by plane . Until recently no foreigners were allowed to visit the region . Pyatigorsk " Yesterday evening I arrived in Pyatigorsk and found lodgings on the outskirts of the town , fairly high up at the foot of the Mashuk ; if a storm comes the clouds will hide my roof . When I opened the window at five o'clock this morning my room was full of the scent of the flowers in the small garden ; cherry blossom gazes into the room and sometimes the wind covers my desk with white petals . The panorama is magnificent : in the West one sees the blue peaks of the five-headed Beshtau ... in the North the Mashuk rises like a Persian fur cap ; in the East below me there lies the clean town ; one hears the murmuring of the mineral springs and the voices of the cosmopolitan crowd . Further away the mountains form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on the edge of the horizon one sees the silver chain of the snow-covered summits from Kasbeck to Elbruz . It is a pleasure to live in such a place . . . . " Thus Lermontov 's Petchorin , " A Hero of Our Times , " probably the most astonishing short story by a 25-year-old writer in all world literature . The journey to Pyatigorsk has become faster , but the jet age , fortunately , has not yet reached the Caucasus . It takes 54 hours by train from Moscow or seven by plane ; arriving in the town at midnight in bright moonlight , the traveler feels something of the old romantic magic of the place . It is a pleasure to live in such a place , but in the early morning some illusions fly away ; open the window at five o'clock , wakened not by the murmuring of the mineral springs or the scent of the flowers but by the infernal noise of the kolkhoz market opposite . The crowd outside is cosmopolitan all right but the fine gentlemen from Petersburg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lermontov saw and fell in love with . It consists of highlanders ( Gortsi ) with their enormous hats , Kabardins , Georgians and RusWALTER Z. LAQUEUR , editor of Soviet Survey , wrote these notes while traveling this past August in the Soviet Union . sians , Armenians and Ukrainians . There are no foreigners in this crowd : until recently they were not allowed in this area at all . Neither the mountains nor the magnificent panorama has changed , but there is a gigantic television mast on the top of the Mashuk , and on a single day the indomitable Elbruz was recently climbed by 1,300 Alpinists . Nowadays Pyatigorsk is a rather dull provincial town with 69,000 inhabitants , 7 public libraries , 15 sanatoria , an Institute of Education and a pharmaceutical college , factories where bricks , reinforced concrete , machinery , butter , liqueurs and chemicals are produced , 4 cinemas , 4 large and several small bookshops , 5 restaurants , 15 nursery schools , a newspaper and a television station . The traveler can get this and other important information from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he finds in his room . There is a special quality about the only hotel in the place ; it appears to date from the period of Pushkin and Lermontov , but the sanitary installations were probably in a better state then . A modern hotel in another part of the town is , however , to be opened shortly and the traveler can not complain about bad service even in the old caravansary ; everyone is courteous , friendly and obliging . ( One has to leave Moscow to become acquainted with Russian hospitality . ) And even the hardened traveler is rather moved when the employees of the " Gostinitsa " wave to him from the window as he leaves ; the gesture provides him with food for thought on the inverse relationship between hygiene and cordiality in modern hotels and the world generally . In the entrance-hall of the hotel there is a branch post office with large pictures of Lenin , Stalin and Kalinin . ( Khrushchev figures , however , in the city 's main post office . ) There are more portraits , busts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the Soviet Union : the Georgians are not apparently prepared to give up the memory of the late Yosef Visseriohovitch . Various queues form in front of the post office counters , including one for telephone couTHE NEW REPUBLIC pons ( or " talons " ) . To book an inter-urban call is a major operation in the Soviet Union . One buys the coupons at the post office ( which is impossible at night ) . Only then a trunk call can be booked at home or from a public call box ; to avoid the complications most Russians prefer to send a telegram . Pyatigorsk is not only a town of sanatoria and factories , it is also a cultural center . Notices on the walls of the houses announce performances by leading theatrical companies from Moscow , Leningrad and Saratov who appear in the summer months . Deborah Pantoffel is to sing arias from La Traviata and Rigoletto . The Great Waltz appears twice ? as a film and as a ballet . Leslie Caron in Lili and Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday enjoys considerable popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Political and Scientific Knowledge " is giving a lecture on the " cunning methods of foreign espionage organizations . " The Moscow engineer Pavel Levin on holiday in Essentuki is speaking about India where he has worked , and a few filmstars from Moscow are appearing in the local television program . The Life of the Streets A walk through the streets of a provincial town like Pyatigorsk provides more vivid impressions and more significant details of the life of the Soviet citizen than weeks in Moscow . The day begins very early in the provinces ; people are already on their feet , or more precisely , in the streets , by 7 o'clock . The crowds are greatest in the kolkhoz market and wooden stalls surrounding it . Men and women with shopping bags stream through the gates of the great market-hall adorned with portraits of the party leaders , and inscriptions about the coming victory of Communism . The Soviet authorities are very touchy about the kolkhoz markets and taking photographs there is very much frowned on . They regard it as a relic of capitalist economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little stools , offering their goods for sale , do so on their own initiative and fix their own prices : it is really a bit of a free market economy inside a completely different economic system . According to the Moscow guides there are no longer any such markets in the capital : but one can see with one 's own eyes that this is not true . The Moscow telephone directory lists no less than 29 such institutions . It is true , however , that the kolkhoz markets have ceased to play an important part in the provisioning of the capital now that basic supplies in the State shops are more or less adequate . In the provinces the kolkhoz market is often still the center of the small town ? at any rate for some hours of the day . The touchiness of the authorities is difficult to understand since the kolkhoz market is obviously bound to disappear in the course of time . Nobody can fathom the economic rationale of these undertakings : how can it possibly pay the women to travel a considerable distance by train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples or plums or a few dozen eggs ? They themselves or their husbands will know best whether it is worth while ; the prices of fruit , vegetables and meat are high and so long as they do not come down to any considerable extent , the markets are likely to continue . Incidentally , in spite of all its primitive fittings , the market-hall is clean and there are no flies . There is no wrapping up either : the buyers bring their own nets or bags . I did not know about this and was advised to buy a newspaper at the entrance for 20 kopecks instead . Not far from the market-hall is the large State food shop ( Gastronom ) . The choice and quality of goods is passable , the prices are high and the purchasing system exasperating . To buy bread , butter and sausage , for example , we have to stand in seven different lines : first of all , we approach the assistant of the particular department , who indicates the price of the commodity ; from there we proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and finally we return to the bread , butter and sausage lines where the goods are eventually handed over . People wait patiently , but sometimes there are altercations and even something of an affray . The police on the street corner , not keen on interfering , look the other way . There is an old Soviet joke about the militia being responsible for order ( Poryadok ) but not for disorder ( Bezporyadok ) . The passivity of the militia led in 1958 to the establishment of the Druzhiny , a kind of Home Guard with a distinctive red arm band who appear in strength especially in the late afternoon and evening . These men and women enlist on a voluntary basis to fight hooliganism and have done more to restore public order than the militia . Although they are unarmed , they are more feared than the militia . The Soviet traffic police are likewise well-known for their vigor and severity . They often stop drivers in the streets without previous warning and subject their vehicles to a pretty thorough inspection . It is needless to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform , is fairly easily spotted even by the untrained foreign visitor . Opposite the kolkhoz market is the public prosecutor 's office and next to it a kiosk where I buy the local morning paper and the Rostov edition of the Moscow Pravda . By the side of the kiosk watches are repaired in a small shop : the traveler sees more shoemakers and watchmakers in Russia than anywhere else in the world . Fifteen years ago a watch was still a rarity ; today they are available in all price ranges , beginning at NOVEMBER 21 , 1960 about 225 rubles ( i.e. $22 ) . Part of the road is excavated and gas pipes are being laid ; there has been talk of a gas supply for years and the local paper complains that the work is not going ahead fast enough . Demands are growing : until about 1950 there was hardly any public transport and no private cars at all , yet today , one of the older inhabitants told us , people grumble if they have to walk a mile or two . Many houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little boy proudly shows us his school ; first impressions were very good but we learnt that there are not enough school buildings in Russia and some of the classes have to be taken in two or three shifts . We asked the little boy whether the teachers are allowed to beat their pupils . He looked up rather pitifully , " No , they are not even allowed to give extra work as a form of punishment . " Odd that in a country with such an authoritarian government teachers are forced to manage without punishments . Among the adults , however , everything is conducted in strictly hierarchical fashion : the senior officer in an institution addresses his subordinates as " thou " whereas they have to address him as " you . " There has been some opposition to this recently , however . ( Old party members are an exception and always address one another as " thou . " ) Such remnants of egalitarianism have by now become rather infrequent . The visitor will hardly be able to shed much new light on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has preoccupied so many critics for more than 3o years . But status plays a very great role in Soviet society : the young lecturer makes a very deep bow indeed when he meets his professor , the deference shown by officials to their superiors is most remarkable , to call him " Comrade Lieutenant " is the surest way to soften the stony heart of a policeman if one has contravened some traffic regulation . One does not see much of the Soviet army in public , but the intention is obviously to make the officer a much more distant figure of respect to the enlisted man than in the American Army , for instance . It would be fascinating to prepare a list of U 's and ? nonU 's in Soviet society . Years ago there simply was the difference between civilized ( kulturny ) and uncivilized behavior ; by now this term is on the way out and has been replaced by a much more complicated set of behavior . It has not only to do with the possession of a country house or a car ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carrying a bundle in the street or smoking an inferior brand of cigarette , or not to be able to dance ( and I do not mean folk dances ) . The choice of men 's apparel is as yet limited by Western standards , but extreme emphasis is now put on clean and correct dress , especially among the intelligentsia . Once upon a time it was de rigueur among Russian intellectuals to neglect their appearance , but these days are gone . Seen in the street : many middle-aged women still wear the headshawl which here as elsewhere in Russia marks the older generation off from the modern young girls hurrying to their offices , shops or factories , many of them with a book under their arm . On a large red roll of honor in the middle of the square are inscribed the names of citizens who have distinguished themselves at work . Not far away there is another pillar on which no one cares to see his name : I read about the commander of the local " Druzhiny " accused of sleeping when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ( name and address given ) with a venomous tongue : she is described as a hooligan and is said to have slandered her fellow-lodgers and written anonymous letters . In Khrushchev 's Russia it is customary to mobilize public opinion against ( unpolitical ) evil-doers who can not be prosecuted under the statutes of " Socialist legislation " ; public denunciations at mock trials specially convened for this purpose are the fashion . A stay in a Soviet provincial town leaves the visitor with a picture that is by no means clear ; it has little in common with the official propaganda put out for foreign consumption . It is equally certain that life in 1960 is very different and much better from what it used to be in the Stalin era . Russia is in the throes of develop ments which may lead in all kinds of directions but , like Gogol 's celebrated Troika it is impossible for anyone to say where the road will end . Essentuki : Fields of sunflowers on either side of the road ; an imposing building , rather like a fortress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had built for himself and which was finished in 1916 . The lay-out of the new part of this little town is pleasant ; the streets are lined with flower beds . There is a touch of the Orient about the old part of Essentuki ; we are near the geographical frontier between Europe and Asia . The main road climbs to about 3,000 feet and it is not long before we reach Kislovodsk . For the Soviet citizen Kislovodsk means Narzan , the mineral water that is drunk all over the Union . There is a Narzan street , a Narzan hotel , a Narzan bookshop , a Narzan art gallery and , needless to say , a Narzan sanatorium and countless other institutions where the name occurs . It comes from the Karbardian and refers to the carbonic drink of the legendary heroic tribe of the Nartens . Nowadays the mineral water is bathed in by unheroic patients suffering from circulatory or other internal complaints , but plenty of Narzan is still drunk . Round the original spring in the spa park , which is now mechanized and surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouses pour out the Narzan for visitors . The patients subject themselves to a strict regimen : for there are 15 different diets and baths and innumerable variations in 5o sanatoria . Not without good cause , Soviet doctors think highly of walking as a cure and there are three standard walks , ranging from half a mile for the infirm to 7 miles for those with no organic disorder . On the way there are 20 check points where one can have one 's pulse and blood pressure measured and where inquiries are made about one 's general state of health . 150,000 visitors come to Kislovodsk alone every year . The Academy of Sciences , the Usbek Council of Ministers and many other more or less important organizations have their own sanatorium here . A considerable number of visitors who come to Kislovodsk are , however , in the best of health . They come because so many of their friends and acquaintances spend the summer months in the Caucasus or because they want to get away from the heat of Baku , Erivan and Tiflis . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from the sanatoria there is only one large hotel and three boarding houses in the place . A key to the problem has been supplied , however , in an article published in the local paper about a man at the railway station who offers to obtain private accommodation for visitors in return for a commission of 15 percent . The area around Kislovodsk was described as follows by Lermontov in " A Hero of Our Times " : " Solitude pervades the whole place and mystery is everywhere : the deep shade of the avenues of lime trees which lean over the noisy foaming river rushing on from stone to stone through the verdant mountains ; and the gorges , misty and silent branching out in all directions ; the fresh aromatic air , impregnated with the fragrance of the tall grasses of the South and the white acacias ; the everlasting sweet drowsy murmuring of the icy streams which meet at the valley 's end and race merrily along to their final plunge into the Podkumok . " Holiday at the Spa It is doubtful whether Lermontov would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery are all gone . At the Khram Vosducha ( the " air temple " ) there is a roundabout that never seems to close down ; the gigantic rocks around the old castle named " Intrigue and Love " are covered with such inscriptions as " long live peace in the whole world " and " Serge Ivanov was here . " Despite the cool weather hundreds of people bathe and row in the lake and one has to line up to get a free table in the " Tourist , " an excellent restaurant , a few miles from the town . To escape the crowds we followed the little footpaths that lead into the mountains : in the distance there are the little mountain villages of the Kabardian-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Republic . In 1944 Stalin had all the Balkars deported to Central Asia and it is only in recent years that some of them have returned to the Caucasus . There are still wild cats , foxes and wolves in the mountains . In winter they come right up to the edge of the town ; bears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best place to undertake sociological studies is the spa park where thousands take the prescribed walk in the late afternoon . Armenians and Georgians have come with large families by taxi or in their own cars , and there are the professors from Moscow , Leningrad or Kiev with their wives . They used to be the best paid section of Soviet society : some of them received more than one salary and were paid 10 , 15 or even zo thousand rubles a month . This has now been changed : a professor can now only draw one salary ( and one pension ) and the maximum is around 5,000 rubles . ( There are , as usual , a very few exceptions . ) But do n't pity them : one can manage quite well on 5,000 rubles , which is 6 or 7 times the average salary . Then there are the actors from the great cities combining a starring part with a holiday at the spa . And finally there are some who really are ill . What do all these people do in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be better organized , otherwise young people may go astray . The newspapers complain that whole sections of the population have been seized by a mania for games . Even in the park you can see them playing cards , dominoes , billiards and a game , unknown to me , called preference . Russians have a traditional weakness for games ; vide Pushkin 's " Pique Dame , " Tolstoy and Dostoevski . Some of them forget time and the world when they become absorbed in cards or billiards . It is not easy to modify this tradition but attempts are now being made to offer more light music and organize lectures , not only on the world political situation and the resolutions of the zest Party Congress but also on such subjects as " Is There Life on the Stars ? " and , more down to earth , " Problems of Married Life . " The day ends early in Kislovodsk . There is no night life . Dance music can be heard coming from one of the sanatoria , " Soviet jazz , " a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dancing is very slow and most of the tunes appear to date from the period of " Alexander 's Ragtime Band . " The last train from Pyatigorsk brings in a few new visitors who line up in the possibly vain hope of getting a taxi . In the food shops work goes on till late in the evening , but even they have closed by now . The last visitors to the flower exhibition in the pump room have returned and over a loudspeaker comes the beginning of the late evening news : Govorit Moskva . In spite of holidays , Narzan and billiards the voice of Moscow is still audible in the Caucasus .
