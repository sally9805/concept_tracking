An Off-Campus Love Story A story by Margaret Dursin My Aunt Fern tended to concentrate heavily on whatever she did ; it made her a famous scientist . In later years , we joked about the time she split the ovary , but back in 1938 nobody had yet thought to split the atom , and we referred to her work as developing multiple ovulations in the little brown bat . Actually her popularity problem was quite as severe as that later suffered by the United States when it experimented with nuclear devices . Fern had to listen to quite as much comment , not in the daily newspapers , but at home in New Amherst , Indiana . Grandfather Winston was professor of Latin at the same university where Aunt Fern was associate professor of biology . Grandmother , Mother , Aunt Ellen , and I were all interested spectators in her social problems . Aunt Fern had never led a wildly romantic life , but there had always been plenty of available young men doing gymnastics on the lower rungs of the teaching profession . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably could n't look for love , but she could easily locate some chemistry goon or a medieval French type . Aunt Fern was tiny , and had n't a physical flaw except that she was n't beautiful . She had regular features and china-blue eyes and brown hair fastened in a bun . She always looked very presentable in a low-pressure way , like a movie heroine before she takes off her glasses  --  but Aunt Fern did n't wear glasses . Nobody ever minded taking Aunt Fern out until she got promoted . But if you put a tall young English instructor next to a tiny associate professor who does n't much care , the instructor begins to feel like a big dumb cluck who has n't made the most of himself ; he does n't call back . Aunt Fern began to sit at home being an associate professor . Grandmother said that maybe Fern had a sub-clinical vitamin deficiency , but Mother said the only deficiency she saw was of eligible men . Aunt Ellen said that Fern would have an ideal life if she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aunt Ellen said she was referring to scientific couples like the Curies , who had dedicated their lives to science . Aunt Fern , who was reading a detective story in the corner , closed her book with a bang and said , " When Pierre Curie reincarnates in New Amherst without his wife , and makes me an offer of marriage , I 'll accept . " Then she swept out of the room looking very attractive . It made me wonder whether rouge or emotions would do her the most good in the long run . Grandmother quickly apologized by saying poor Fern was lonesome . Thirty was an awkward age although not recognized as such in child-care books , and she hoped Gesell would keep going until he reached the ages of her children , as the parent-child relationship could be very difficult between the ages of thirty and fifty , and we need a scientific guide for the period when parents are turning childlike , and children parentlike . Grandfather , when consulted , saw no need for Fern to marry . He pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financial freedom among friends . He said he felt it unfortunate that superior people so often became emotionally entangled in marriage when the clean straight lines of personal freedom might have led to greater happiness . Grandmother hoped in a clenched voice that he was merely quoting from a minor Latin poet . " Henpectus , my dear , " said Grandfather , hastily , but the next week he brought home to dinner an assistant college-textbook editor from a New York publishing house . Mother and I sat on one side of the table across from Fern and the Young Man , and we ate pot roast and drank Dago Red out of a Chianti bottle , and lit the ceiling with a crackling display of Winston wit and erudition with pauses for the Young Man to contribute drab personal experiences in the big city . Fern was just as charming as if he had been the grocery boy , and just as detached . It was n't my fault that he asked me to go for a walk around the campus after supper . I was fifteen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked men . Mother said that I had dealt a death blow to Aunt Fern 's confidence in her sex appeal . Grandmother said that of course if Fern had cared to take the trouble  --  but it was the principle of the thing , Dear , and I would never be popular unless I maintained a ladylike approach . " Like Aunt Fern ? " I asked , and they gave me reproachful looks and left . Aunt Ellen later told Grandmother I should he gotten out of the house Margaret Du rain , whose earlier story called " The Bat Lady " also dealt with the family in this one , is herself from an academic background in Akron , Ohio . Now living in Pleasantville , New York , she has taught at Westchester Community College , and written four novels . until Fern was unsettled , and I think she was right . Fern settled down to fourth-quarter review in advanced physiology , embryology , and assorted cold cuts with the biology majors . Weekends , she set up experimental work for metabolism studies on bats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon in May , " can say that breathing is not respectable . " The family was not very sympathetic with her work on bats ' ovaries . " It is not sensational , " said Aunt Ellen . " It is not even very interesting , " I said . " It is useful , " said Aunt Ellen , " and traditional and if you grow up to be as sensible as your Aunt Fern , we can all be grateful . " At that moment a terrific chugging was heard on the street , and a large piece of machinery ground to a stop directly in front of where we were sitting on the front porch . It ejected a gorgeous hunk of man in dirty work clothes who came up the walk . His hair was curly black , and so was the hair on his chest because his shirt was open . One cheek had a smudge of oil , but on the other , you could see that he needed a shave . He walked like a man who was tired in all his muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking for a long time yet . " Hi , Fern , " he said . " How are you feeling ? " " I 'm perfectly all right , thank you , " said Fern in a very small voice . It had an odd squeak in it , and she was hunched down in her chair blushing . All her Aunt Fern-ness was gone , and I 'd never seen her look so pretty . It came to me that he ought to be wearing a sash around his waist and a dagger in his teeth . He ought to pick up Aunt Fern , sling her over his shoulder , throw her into the maw of the machine , and drive off into the sunset . Fern sat up with a great effort . " Mother , " she said , " This is Edward Wyroski ; my mother . And this is my sister Ellen and my niece Diane . " He nodded to us , but kept his eyes on Fern . " Ed saved me from a fall today , " explained Fern . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , one of those they 're tearing down to widen the road . " " Fern , " said Grandmother , " where are you hurt ? " " No place , " said Fern impatiently . " I fell off the ladder and Ed caught me . " " You would n't think a hundred pounds could land so hard , " said Ed . He held up his forearm where a dark bruise was swelling . " I bet you got 62 Privacy by David Shapiro The ocean is full of flowers that betray me because your unhappiness has a hospital in it with vacillating doctors who care about everyone . Even with patience like slow music we wo n't be well again and here are the shades closing , the doors closing . When it was winter outside I played master . The grapes were frozen and my own jaws tightened around a really beautiful piece of flesh . I could n't stop in the motion I was falling . Can I brush back your hair which is falling ? Ca n't I live nearby you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pay for comfort and your chairs . I have removed all the evidence that you were here except when I tremble , when I dream , when I breathe I bleed . one , too . " Their eyes held for a moment , and Fern 's dropped . " But Fern , you never fall off ladders , " said Grandmother , and I think you ought to tell me these things , " and with a nod to Ed , " not that we are n't very grateful . " " A ten-foot drop , " said Ed , admiringly to Grandmother . " And she stays as cool as a cucumber until she finds out that she smashed a bat . So she cries about the bat . " Grandmother and Aunt Ellen and I carefully did not look at each other . Aunt Fern cries when she is angry , and if she needed that bat for her experiment , she was n't weeping tender tears . " t h , wo n't you sit down , Ed ? " said Grandmother . " Diane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I got back the inquisition was going full swing . The Winstons are very democratic about whom they talk to the face , and behind the back , of . You might say we were not snobs , only perfectionists . " Hot compresses , " said Aunt Ellen , " are the very best thing for bruises . You must have your wife put on hot compresses . " " I 'm not married , " said Ed . " It must be dusty , driving that  --  er  --  vehicle , " said Grandmother , sympathetically rocking back and forth . " Do you do it all day ? " " Well , " said Ed , " it 's like if I asked you if you worked that rocking chair all day . Some days you do and some you do n't . " He took a sip of homemade grape juice as though it were what he drank every day . " Is your home around here ? " asked Aunt Ellen . " My folks come from Chicago , " said Ed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , " supplied Aunt Fern . " Ed 's a contractor . " " You folks want a reference , " said Ed , " call Mr. Beatty at the First National Bank . " He turned to Fern . " How about going out to dinner tonight if you really feel okay ? " " It 's our Daughters of New Amherst night , " reminded Grandmother . " Oh , Mother , I do n't always have to go to that , " said Fern . Sometimes , I admired the way the Winstons operated . In one sentence , Grandmother had established that Fern was a socially eligible girl who would n't be spending the evening at home in any case , and Fern had let Ed know she was dying to go out with him without having to say a word directly . That evening , he showed up at the house properly dressed . He took Fern out to a very expensive dinner , and a few nights later to a carnival . He took her places she would not ordinarily go , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the large panda Fern brought back from the carnival , and told her she should not let Ed spend so much money on her . Fern explained that in Ed 's business , be owed so many people so much money , and others owed him so much back , that he did n't count money like ordinary people . Ed took Fern to Churchill Downs , and they got a story by Margaret Dursin 63 back from the long ride very late . At breakfast the next morning Fern said there was more to horse racing than she had supposed when a physiologically sound beast could be beaten by a nag who had nothing to recommend him except a hereditary record for running well in mud , She said there seemed to be a number of scientific records kept on racehorses including physical histories and mental traits and moods . She thought that mental records on other animals might be interesting , provided they were correlated to physical condition . When she had finished her metabolism study , she might run a series relating the happiness quotient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , that psychology could give her insights into the possible satisfactions of brown bats . " What did Ed think of this idea ? " inquired Mother . " That is n't what we talked about , " said Fern and staggered off to a nine o'clock class . Grandfather said it was hard enough to raise a child into physiology without having her go around in a road scraper , Aunt Ellen said if he 'd noticed lately , it was a Cadillac convertible , and she did n't see why there always had to be something wrong with men with beautiful cars . Mother said there was n't a thing the matter with Ed except that he was migratory , uneducated , and ineligible . Grandmother said that every girl should have a rich suitor once in her life , and Fern deserved some relaxation after all the years she had studied so hard . Ed brought Fern a box of chocolates , two fashion magazines and a best-selling novel about sex life in small towns . We all ate the candy and read the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up very becomingly . Grandfather did not like the novel . He said the Romans did that kind of thing much better because they were at ease with their bodies . Ile said between the Post Office and modern plumbing , there was no really natural school of literature in America . Grandmother said it was nice to have read a book ahead of all her friends who signed up on the library list , but that she personally preferred books with fewer bodies and more love . Mother said she was under the impression that the two often went together , but Aunt Ellen said that what Grandmother meant was emphasis , and that sex scandals were very tragic for everyone concerned . Aunt Fern said she did not think that true love was ever tragic , because no matter what came after , you had had it . " Most people want to keep it , " said Mother , who had lost my father . " I would think of love as a loan from heaven , " said Fern . " It does n't seem to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that Ed Wycoski ceased to be an interesting type , and became the man who might make Fern non-Winston . But I do n't think Fern even noticed the closing of the family ranks against them . She must have been occupied with the diversities of love . This probably accounted for her inviting Ed home to a company dinner . Grandmother was in the kitchen frying chicken . Fern was setting the table with the best china , which almost matched a bouquet of pink roses she had picked from the vine on the front porch . Aunt Ellen was in the library with the encyclopedia and the business section of the Sunday New York Times , looking for information on road construction in order to carry on polite conversation with Ed . Grandfather had put on his oldest tweed jacket which had worn through the elbow patches , and muttered , " Lot of damned nonsense , " at intervals . As he adored Marcus Aurelius , it could n't have been the book he was reading . It was going to be an awful meal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " why the family dislikes Ed so much . He 's the handsomest man I shall ever know . " " Have you ever thought about all Fern 's defects ? " asked Mother . ' ' She is n't athletic or artistic or domestic or a leader . She is n't even average . Fern has a high IQ and an ability to exploit scholastic achievement . How can she make Ed happy with that ? " " You 're all afraid of Ed . " " I expect we 're a little neurotic about the common man , " said Mother . " We wish it were n't so lonely in the ivory tower . We wish the foundations were n't rocked by what the least educated man wants for the United States  --  or what a half-educated man might want for Fern . " " I 'd rather be romantic , " I said . Dinner started off politely . It was cream of asparagus soup , and Grandfather discoursing on his grandfather who had been a tin peddler in Vermont . I removed the soup plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that great-great-grandfather only peddled two summers while working his way through Harvard Divinity . After I 'd brought out the dishes of chicken and peas and mashed potatoes and canned corn and spiced peaches and homemade rolls and currant jelly , I set the plates in front of Grandfather so that he could ask each person what he wanted . Aunt Ellen was wrestling with road construction , and you could tell that the encyclo-64 AN OFF-CAMPUS LOVE STORY pedia did n't know the same things about it that Ed did . Fern at there looking dreamy . Grandmother kept pressing currant jelly on Ed in between the macadam and the cement . The conversation ran down , and for the first time I could remember there was nothing but the sound of chewing at the Winston dinner table . Ed swallowed a large bite and initiated a sentence . " I 'd like to speak to you after dinner , " he said to Grandfather . When we got up from the table , I dashed for the sewing room upstairs . If you stick your head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library . Iwished I could have seen Ed walk into Grandfather 's library , which I have always been convinced was designed to make intellectuals feel ill at ease . The shelves were loaded with used great books , and used books that would have been great if anybody had read them , and used books that were curiosities , and used books that Grandfather just happened to like . There was an authentic smell of leather and furniture polish and dust . Then Ed spoke . " Ars gratis artis ? " he said firmly . I nearly fell into the grate . " In a way , " said Grandfather , " but the effect is nice , do n't you think ? " He never went to MetroGoldwyn-Mayer movies , or any other kind for that matter . I could hear them sitting down . Grandfather in his brown leather chair ; Ed in the wooden captain 's chair , which had a lovely patina from students having wriggled their bottoms in it over the years . You wanted to see me , " said Grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry . " " And ? " " Habeas corpus , " said Ed . There was a short silence while Grandfather digested a remark that was rude , but indubitably Latin . " You find yourself forgetting your Latin ? " he said at last . " I never had any , " said Ed . " I only know what you hear around . " Grandfather snorted . " You were asking for my daughter 's hand . " " In toto , " said Ed . Not bad , " said Grandfather , getting into the spirit of things . " But what can you offer her ? " " Sigma Chi ? " said Ed . " Wrong language , " said Grandfather . " In deo speramus ? " " You 're getting there . " " E pluribus unum ? " " The aim of all good marriages , " said Grandfather , " but no bigamy , mind . " " Nihil desperandum , " said Ed , making rustling noises as though wiping his forehead . " I had not realized , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional language in the United States  --  it might make an interesting paragraph in The American Scholar . Do you know any more ? " " Pax vobiscum , if it 's all right with you , " said Ed getting up . " It 's Fern 's decision . " " Exit , " said Ed . They were married very quietly at the end of June . Grandmother said that Ed was a very unusual young man , Grandfather said that it is n't the amount of education , but the ability to correlate what we did n't know we knew that makes the difference . Aunt Ellen wrote all her friends that since Ed had nothing to recommend him but money and good looks , she could only suppose that Fern had married for love .
