The U.S. economy seems headed for its most expansive era yet in the 1970s . That was the message of a study presented last week by Martin Gainsbrugh , chief economist of the National Industrial Conference Board , a private center for business research . Two years in preparation by a dozen of the board 's staff economists , the study projects remarkable advances in family income , now averaging $9,300 . By the end of the next decade , the typical American household will earn almost $14,000 - in terms of today 's prices - and enjoy a 40% increase in the real standard of living . At the same time , the number of families with incomes above $10,000 will rise from 15 million to 34 million . Those with less than $5,000 will decrease from 13 million to less than 11 million out of a total 61,400,000 . <P> The N.I.C.B. figures that U.S. production , which has increased an average 3% annually for the whole 20th century but rose to 4.5% during the ' 60s , will continue to grow by 4.5% a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually large rise in the labor force , the result of high birth rates in the late 1940s and 1950s . The labor force has been increasing by an average 1.2% a year , but in the 1970s it will jump 1.7% annually . In addition , continued investment in research and new plants should maintain productivity gains at the historic rate of 2.8% a year . Altogether , the gross national product , in terms of current dollars , should come close to $1.25 trillion by 1975 and $1.5 trillion by 1980 . <P> Gainsbrugh warns , however , that these prospects for prosperity will prove hollow if inflation continues at its current rate of more than 4% . If it does , he says , it " could foreshadow a boom followed by a severe deflation later in the 1970s . " Convinced that sensible Government policy will avoid such a crisis , he estimates that inflation will average 2% during the decade . Tending to reinforce his assumption , such economic barometers as industrial production and personal income have begun to level out under the growing pressure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
