txt AIRLINES PROPOSE ALTERNATE PLAN TO 4111 JETPORT Would Divert Private Planes and . Expand 3 Fields Port Agency Disagrees By EDWARD HUDSON A committee of - 10 major airlines offered yesterday r airport proposal it said would meet the needs of New York through 1980 without a fourth jetport . The proposal was immediately attacked by the Port of New York Authority , which operates the three jetports In the metropolitan area and has long held that a fourth will be badly needed between 1970 and 1975 . The agency called the committee 's technical study " specious , unrealistic and unworkable . " A statement it i support of a fourth airport was also issued by Pan American World  --  Airways , which is not a member of the committee . Pan Am said planning for the new site should proceed without delay . New Runways Proposed The committee 's plan is to increase the capacity of the three existing jetports  --  Kennedy International , La Guardia and Newark ? by diverting many business and private planes note . using them to " superior " private fields nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three main airports plus separate runways for air taxis and other light planes that choose to continue to fly in . Two airfields proposed for development as attractive alternatives for light planes were Teterboro Airport in New Jersey , now used almost exclusively by light aircraft and soon to be modernized by Pan American , and either the Floyd Bennett Naval Air . Station in Brooklyn or another unnamed airport in Staten Island . Floyd Bennett is still in military hands . The committee indicated that it had no specific recommendation on which of several public agencies might be persuaded to take over and develop Floyd Bennett or any other field . Nor was there any indication that the military was prepared to give up Floyd Bennett , Group Formed in January The program was put forth at a news conference in the Roosevelt Hotel held by the Metropolitan Airlines Committee , an organization formed last January by the major airlines : , erring New York to ' represent their common interests in airport planning . The committee , headed by Elwood R. Quesada , former Federal Aviation Administrator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conducted ' for the committee by an independent consulting concern . The committee also released copies of letters sent Oct. 15 to the Governors of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut , outlining its recommendations . One suggestion advanced to the Governors was for one of // for a new jetport as a " land bank , " to be held until there is agreement that a fourth jetport is required . A spokesman for Governor Rockefeller of New York said last night that the committee 's report was under study by the Governor 's staff. - Last July 29 Mr. Rockefeller , citing a need ' for " immediate action " toward building a new jetport , had asked the Porn Authority for a " definitve recommendation " on a site before January . Over the last six years the Port Authority has issued four major reports on 20 possible sites for a new jetport in the metropolitan area , but only one was found to meet all its criteria . This is the Great Swamp area ' in Morris County , N .. J. , about 25 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local residents defeated this plan . Part of the area is now a National Wildlife Refuge , Port Authority Replies Reacting yesterday to the committee 's proposals , the Port Authority'issued the texts of letters sent Monday to Governor Rockefeller and Gov . Richard J. Hughes of New Jersey , detailing the agency 's objections to the committee 's findings . The findings had been given to the bi-state port agency in advance . In assailing the committee 's technical study , the Port Authority said : " It sheds crocodile tears over the problems of corporate and private aviation and then proposes to exclude almost all aircraft from the three major airports except those carrying airline passengers . " The port agency charged that the study , by R. Dixon Speas Associates of Manhasset , L. I. , " was an attempt to support the theories and objectives " of C. R. Smith , chairman of American Airlines . and also chairman of the airline committee . ' Extensive ' Studies Cited Last October , when tJe airlines first began to sponsor independent jetport studies by the Speas organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it said , " extensive " , studies had already been ' done and there was no point in duplicating them . American Airlines Was one of the prime movers in organizing such independent studies , which culminated in the Speas report the committee finally made public yesterday . The basic points advanced by the airline committee yesterday were as follows : ( Rod Authority forecasts of existing airport capacity have been too conservative . By 1980 Kennedy , LaGuardia and- Newark will be able to handle 197 , plane movements an hour in instrument weather , as against 162 movements now possible . The committee 's program , plus expected improvements in airtraffic procedures and expansion plans already in being , will make this so . ( Even with an increase in capacity , the three airports %yin fall far short of demand , unless private and business planes can be lured away by more attractive facilities elsewhere . The light planes now constitute a fourth of the traffic at the three main airports , and their numbers are expected to grow even larger . A. fourth jetport in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing jetports . By 1975 the capacity of the three airports will be 187 movements an hour , and demand will be 233 . A fourth jetport would attract only 25 of these hourly movements , it is ' estimated , leaving 21 movements an hour uncared for at the present fields . In its rebuttal to the Governors , the Port Authority took issue with the study on the following main points : ' ( Instrument-weather operations at Teterboro , Floyd Bennett or a Staten Island airport would severely interfere with regular flights at the three main airports . ( New runways and other changes recommended in the study for Newark , La Guardia and Kennedy , as well as a civilian conversion of Floyd Bennett , would " substantially " increase noise in metropoltan communities . ( The airport changes recommended in the airline study would involve construction costs that might equal or exceed the cost of a new jetport . ( Most of the operational conclusions and proposals in the study " are totally unsubstantiated , " ( The committee acknowledged that a final computer analysis on ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months. ) lOnly 15 per cent of the private flying at the three main airports is " re/ocatable. " according to a Port Authority survey , not 48 per cent , as suggested in the Speas study . ( Even if all light planes were barred from the three existing jetports , the capacities of these fields would still be inadequate to meet the demands of 1975 . This was a conclusion of an Aviation Development Council report last year , in which the Port Authority and some airlines , including American , took part . Inconvenience Foreseen The airline committee argued that travelers would be ' inconvenienced V a fourth jetport . It said a new field would aggravate flight-connection problems and increase the chances that a traveler would land , on his return from a trip , at an airport other than that at which he parked his car when he left . The committee acknowledged , too ; that the carriers faced additional landing fees and other charges at ' t fourth airport .
