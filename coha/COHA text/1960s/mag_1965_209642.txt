QUESTIONS OF TRAVEL by Elizabeth Bishop . 95 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $3.95 . <P> <P> " And some there are who wander the world looking for what is like unto themselves , " old Andr Gide once mused . " But there are others , and I am one of these , who seek above all strangeness in things . " Poet Elizabeth Bishop is another one of these . For more than 30 years , she has wandered the five continents in search of the intractable , in search of a beauty unbefriending and the poetry of the passing strange . Travel is her profession , and her art is the art of snapshot . Her poems are bright slides that commemorate in gloating color and big-pored detail the places she went , the things she saw , the tiny epiphanies of passage . They are very few and very fine . In Poems : North and South-A Cold Spring ( 1954 ) , her volume of collected verse , there are only 48 poems , but they include some of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Questions of Travel there are only 20 poems , but six of them are egregiously good . One is a 30-page prose poem that contains this spectacular child's-eye view of a horse being shod : " He is enormous . His rump is a brown , glossy world . His ears are secret entrances to the underworld . One of his legs is doubled up behind him in an improbable affectedly polite way . Clear bright-green bits of stiffened froth , like glass , are stuck around his mouth . . and the cloud of his odor is a chariot in itself . " <P> Most of the best poems in the book describe Brazil , where Poet Bishop has kept a pied terre since 1952 , and describe it in images that blazon the retina long after the book is closed . In " The Armadillo , " for instance , she pictures the " frail , illegal fire balloons " that during Holy Week float up from Brazilian villages into the starry darkness , where they " flare and falter , wobble and toss " like fiery little moons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers flush and fill <P> with light <P> that comes and goes , like hearts . . . <P> Last night another big one fell . <P> It splattered like an egg of fire <P> against the cliff behind the house . <P> The flame ran down . We saw the pair <P> of owls who nest there flying up <P> and up , their whirling black-and-white <P> stained bright pink underneath , until <P> they shrieked up out of sight .
