txt Washington , July ** chirp and peep and , bewilderingly , try to slay each other , these five , fluffy , cinnamon colored infants which some deem as priceless as the finest gems or greatest art . They are whooping crane chicks thriving in indoor and outdoor nurseries under 24-hour watch at the government 's Maryland Patuxent wildlife research center 20 miles from here . If they prove anything , it is , that great world powers sometimes can display tenderness and care about strange and wonderful things such as the perpetuation of the grand and nearly exterminated whooping crane . War Enters Picture But , befitting the tragic history of the huge birds , had it not been for the Israeli-Arab crisis , the five might have been six , altho no one really can say . Once upon a time , whoopers nested in Illinois , but no more . Once upon a time , there were thousands upon thousands of them , but no more . Last fall , when the whoopers - America 's tallest bird at nearly 5 feet-set down at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were 43 , five of them born that summer in Canada 's Northwest Territory not far from the Arctic circle . Still , the whooper-counters stniled . In the fall of 1939 , there were only 22 wild whoopers alive , and some who thought about whooping cranes at all predicted disaster because no one knows how low the population of any species may fall before it no longer can reproduce itself . Combine in Egg Hunt This year , the United States and Canadian governments decided to embark for the first time on a whooper egg hunt . At Patuxent , American scientists such as Dr. Ray Erickson , assistant center director , had been preparing for this day for six years . Work had begun then with the sandhill cranes , scientifically considered a rare species . The whoopers are labeled " endangered . " Scientists hatched sandhill crane eggs in incubators . They experimented with feeding . They gave antibiotics for intestinal upsets . They worked on problems of " imprinting , " a process which permits the very young birds to identify with their own species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate with their own kind . Make Regular Surveys May 31 , Erickson and Glen Smart , the center 's supervising biologist , flew from Washington to Fort Smith , Canada , to embark on a conservation strategy as documented and prepared as any battlefield assault . For years , the Canadian wildlife service Has been making regular helicopter surveys of the whooper nests . in the marshy , remote fastness of Wood Buffalo national park . Erickson had , for instance , charted dates on which the whooper eggs had been laid in the huge nests . This mattered . The biologists felt the eggs to be flown to the United States would have a better chance of hatching if they were removed the last week before hatching . A whooper egg incubates about 30 days . " It was n't really stealing , " Erickson said . " It was rescuing doomed eggs . " Approaches Their Nests The female whooper lays two eggs , a day or two apart . Frequently one is damaged , never to hatch . Or , if it does , the elder chick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unexplained violence noted at Patuxent and typical of birds . June 2 , a helicopter flew Erickson and a Canadian biologist from Fort Smith to the nesting grounds . The Americans had agreed the Canadians would remove the eggs . Sloshing thru water a foot to 15 inches deep , Ernie Kuyt of the Canadian wildlife service gingerly approached three nests while the parents , some rising into flight , left . Taking one egg . from each nest , and leaving the second , and carrying the purloined eggs in a sock , Kuyt reboarded the helicopter that returned to Fort Smith . Erickson placed the eggs in a portable incubator brought from Patuxent . The helicopter returned to the nesting grounds . Another three eggs were taken and rushed to Fort Smith . Wrap in Tissue Paper A few hours later , while Erickson and Smart guarded their treasures , a fixed wing Canadian aircraft flew over the nesting grounds . The whooper parents had , or were , returning to the nests to incubate the remaining egg . There was jubilation among the humans . Later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest 4% inches long-in tissue paper , and tucked three each in two special suitcases . Because 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is the best incubating temperature , the suitcases were heated by two hot water bottles in each . The eggs fitted in specially designed compartments . Holes to accommodate thermometers also had been cut into the cases . During their nearly 25-hour " egg hap " from Fort Smith to Friendship airport near Baltimore ? a trip that required three changes of planes and a brief glimpse at the precious eggs by a surprised United States customs man at Great Falls , Mont. ? one of the two men checked the thermometers every two or three minutes . But tragedy struck at Billings , ont . The whooper chick begins to peep 8 to 12 hours before he starts the arduous task of trying to chip his way free from his egg prison , another 8 to 12 hour process . Erickson and Smart heard a peep in one egg . They prayed the chick would hold off until it arrived at Patuxent . One Chick Dies At Billings , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger nail in the shell , then died . " We have done an autopsy and nothing abnormal was found , " Erickson said . " We just do n't know . It was a day premature . It may have been weak . But we also think the high altitudes  --  these birds are used to living around 1,000 feet above sea level at the most  --  and the differing pressurization in the planes could be the reason . " Canada , as concerned as the United States , had hoped to provide Erickson and Smart with a Canadian jet that would fly the eggs nonstop into Friendship , permitting , Erickson felt , more control of altitude and pressurization . But on June 2 the Israeli-Arab conflict , which erupted into war on June 5 , was sizzling . The " whooping crane " jet was diverted to United Nations use . Put in Incubator Late June 3 , Maryland state police met the flight and hurried eggs and scientists to Patuxent . Shortly before midnight , the five eggs were tenderly installed in the center 's incubator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 24-hour watch began . And Erickson , not given to overstatement , reported he was " exhausted . " June 9 , two downy whoopers hatched . Two more arrived on June 11 . The fifth was clocked in on June 13 . Each weighed about a quarter of a pound and stood 8 or 9 inches . While her husband was working in Canada , Mrs. Erickson was at home here sewing two enormous white shrouds with gauze strips over the eyes . The whooper chicks were not to see a human , in human form , or hear a human voice , until the scientists were certain the image had been fixed in their infant brains that they were whoopers . Nursery Is Described To a nonauthority on whoopers , a description of their specially built indoor nursery was astounding . Two plyboard , life size , figures of adult whoopers had been painstakingly prepared , painted in the adult whooper plumage of white with the ruby crown and black wing feathers , and articulated so the necks could bend as in feeding . They were mounted where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erickson for a time had hoped to dye white a sandhill crane adult , also a large bird , gray in plumage . Tests were done on the sandhill feathers to learn which dye substance would take best . But the plan was abandoned . Instead a live , still-gray sandhill was placed in a larger cage opposite the whooper chicks . And he , in addition to being a father figure , proved to be a protective foster father . He cheeped crane talk to them across the netting . " Father " Has Left He tried to protect them when the silent , faceless , white robed figures resembling Ku Klux Klansmen lost in an aviary entered the nursery area with food . But the robes are gone now . The " father " sandhill has been returned to his normal pursuits . On days when the sun shines and the temperature rises to 75 or more , the whooper chicks are moved to their outdoor nursery . An intestinal problem that assailed one ? he is still the smallest because it slowed his weight gain  --  was handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered another has been hobbled until it strengthens . A grave danger with whooper chicks , as with sandhills raised previously , is to overfeed unintentionally . The skeletal structure may weigh too much for the spindly legs . Double Birth Weight The whoopers have nearly doubled their birth weight . But this is the sheerest margin of a beginning . Much lies ahead . Why , for instance , do the whooper chicks seek to destroy each other ? Erickson reported they would see each other thru the net and glass separations between their pens , and try to charge , peeping a juvenile war cry of fury . Will man succeed in his great plan to raise in captivity whoopers that , once released , will know enough to take up the migratory habits of their wild kin  --  the great , 2,500-mile spring flight from Texas to the Canadian nesting grounds , and the fall return ? The five now so eagerly watched at Patuxent will never be free . They are destined as breeding stock for offspring who , if all goes well , some day will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from tip to tip . Canus Is His Name Erickson hopes the five little ones will grow up as has Canus named for Canada and the United States , a 3-year-old whooper at Patuxent found as a young bird injured and unable to fly on the Canadian nesting grounds . Canus is tractable , dignified , tolerant of man , and incredibly handsome despite the unavoidable amputation of one wing . But the offspring of these five  --  a day at best four to six years away when they reach sexual maturity-will be raised differently . They must be brought up to be wild . And , if a technique successful with the sandhills works with the whoopers , man may be able to dramatically increase the egg production . The sandhills also lay two eggs a season . But if these eggs are removed immediately , the female lays more eggs . Production of 17 sandhill eggs for one female per breeding season has been achieved at Patuxent . Sex Is Important Another relevant question persists . What are the sexes of the five whoopers ? Is it possible Patuxent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knows altho such odds would seem impossible . " And we wo n't know until they are about a year old , " said Erickson with a patient smile . " Then they will begin calling to each other . The male bill is held higher than the female 's when he calls . That 's the only ways we can tell . " And if he has six males ? " We 'll have to return for more eggs next year , " Erickson answered . But there are other reasons for optimism . At the San Antonio zoo , two of the seven whoopers in captivity are incubating two eggs , their first . In far-off Wood Buffalo national park , eight chicks have hatched , say the Canadians . If they , and the 43 at Aransas last fall , all make it back to Texas this fall a wildly optimistic hope since some always are lost or die , there would be 51 wild whooping cranes in the world , a virtual whooper population ex , plosion . Could Be Famous Tear This year could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crane . To some Americans and Canadians who never have seen , nor wish to see , a whooping crane , it may all seem ridiculous and costly . But to others , musing upon man 's history of plundering , polluting , and abusing the earth , the sky , and the seas , and exterminating with a willful hand fish and animals and birds , it may instead be a sign that man can repent and care .
