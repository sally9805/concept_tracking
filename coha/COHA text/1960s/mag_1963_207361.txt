Julian Grimau Garcia was 25 and a detective in Madrid when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 . But he was also a member of the Spanish Communist Party , and his professional police training soon landed him a key job in the Red apparatus . He became chief of " criminal investigations " for Madrid , Valencia and Barcelona , ferreting out supporters of Francisco Franco . Part of Grimau 's job was to serve on kangaroo courts , called Chekas ( after the onetime initials of the Soviet secret police ) , which ordered dozens of summary death sentences during the brutal three-year war . <P> After the Republican collapse Grimau fled , worked as a Communist agent in Czechoslovakia , Russia , Mexico and Cuba . A member of the central committee of the outlawed Spanish Communist Party , he was living in France when he slipped across the frontier in 1959 to reorganize the Spanish Communist underground . After several trips in and out of Spain since 1959 , an informer gave him away to police in Madrid last November . Franco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogation . During one session , Grimau leaped , fell , or was pushed from a first-floor window , fracturing his skull and both arms . <P> <P> Last week , with a large dent in his forehead , gaunt , balding Grimau heard a seven-man military court tick off the charges against him ; they ranged from " continuing military rebellion " to arson , torture and execution of anti-Republicans by the Chekas 25 years ago . The maximum penalty was death . Did he care to say something before sentence was passed ? " Only this , " replied Grimau . " Since 1936 , I have lived the life of a Communist . I will die a Communist . " <P> Then he took his seat and listened in tently as the court pronounced the sentence everyone expected-death . <P> This was the cue for Communist dem onstrations in half a dozen West Eu ropean cities ; Nikita Khrushchev , no stranger to executions , had the gall to send a personal appeal for clemency to Franco . Grimau 's wife vainly urged President Kennedy to intervene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out the penalty . At a meeting with his Cabinet , Franco upheld the sentence . <P> Next day at dawn , Grimau , pale but composed , was led into the courtyard of Carabanchel Prison just outside Madrid . He walked alone to the wall , refused a blindfold , shouted " Viva el Comunismo ! " , and then collapsed under a volley of shots fired by Spanish Moroccan troops .
