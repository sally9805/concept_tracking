It was most curious . To New York newspaper offices last week came a telegram signed by Eleanor Roosevelt and charged by Western Union to her privately listed telephone number . It denounced Democratic Secretary of State Dean Rusk for his description , made during a Madrid stopover , of Spain 's Dictator Francisco Franco as " an ally of the U.S. in the fight against Communist aggression . ' ' Said the telegram : " That a member of this Administration could praise a Fascist tyrant who has violated every basic precept of freedom and decency is indefensible just as General Franco is indefensible . " <P> Next morning Mrs. Roosevelt denied that she had sent any such telegram ; it apparently had been called into the telegraph office by an impostor . Said Eleanor : " While the sentiments might not be far away from what I think , I would never send a telegram of this sort to the Secretary of State . " Just as curious as the episode itself was the editorial applause given to the fraud by the New York Times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Se non e vero , e ben trovato , ' which roughly translated means : ' Even if it was n't true , it was a good idea . ' "
