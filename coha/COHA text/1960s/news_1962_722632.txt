txt Letters to The Times Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The present Soviet influence in Cuba is admittedly a threat to our security , but condemnation of the situation in moral terms once again lays the United States open to the charge of hypocrisy . What difference is there between Russian military support of Cuba and United States support , for example , of Turkey ? One might claim that Castro is a dictator and runs a police state . But at least he came to power to public acclaim . Cuban refugees and reports from within the country must be somewhat discounted , as Cuba has traditionally had elements dissident to any government ? to Batista , to Prio , to Batista 's first regime , etc . General Gursel in Turkey took power in a military coup and there is no assurance that the present government there has any more popular support than Castro in Cuba ; the recent elections in Turkey were not what Americans would consider democratic . Another country bordering the Soviet Union and receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only an autocracy but is a monarchy , an institution which is moral anathema to people in all parts of the world . Our support of the above countries and the concurrent establishment of our military influence on Russia 's borders is morally no more worthy than the Soviet Union 's influence in Cuba , and our pious protestations about Cuba must appear ludicrous in the eyes of the world . Political realism states that the eventual victor is the only one who will be " right . " We should concentrate on the task of being sure that we are the victor , and cease the hypocritical condemnation of the enemy 's tactics as unmoral . CHARLES F. MANSFIELD . New York , Sept. 8 , 1962 . No Violence Feared Thus , as far as I could ascertain , the possibility of violence , racial or otherwise , interfering with a midmorning ceremony celebrating the opening of new low-rent housing units on the block  --  a ceremony precisely similar to many others which have been held in many similar blocks in the city  --  was never entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reasonable . Of course , I am aware that the West Ninety-fourth Street block in question is not a pretty one . Actually , the city government has been hard at work on this block , expediting undertakings designed to relieve tensions . The Commission on Human Rights has been concentrating on that block . So have voluntary agencies In the area . As for housing , that block contains a total of fifty buildings of which thirty are definitely scheduled to be rehabilitated and ten to be demolished  --  all in Stage I of the West Side Urban Renewal Program . In other words , all existing government programs and facilities are already being utilized to remedy conditions . The social and housing problems Mayor Denies 94th St. Ban Dedication Postponed , Not Canceled , Wagner Explains TO THE EDITOR OF THENEW YORK TIMES : I scarcely remember when I was more amazed by a Times editorial than when I read yours of Sept. 7 entitled " The Decay of New York . " On Sept. 5 the usually factual news columns of The Times reported as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to base an editorial on that untruth . I refer to your editorial reference to the " decision to cancel the dedication of rehabilitated buildings on West Ninety-fourth Street because an outbreak of violence was feared . " You refer to this as though it were a fact , although it was based entirely on your " dope " story reporting that the Executive Committee of the Housing Policy Board had made such a decision at a meeting on Aug. 29 . I did n't get around to making an inquiry into the actual facts until I saw your editorial , in which you concluded , on the basis of what already had struck me as a ridiculous report , that " this was equivalent to a confession that the police could not guarantee the safety of Mayor Wagner at a ceremony . . . in broad daylight in the heart of Manhattan 's West Side . " I separately asked the following members of the Housing Policy Board Executive Committee for the precise facts in the situation : Chairman James Felt of the Planning Commission ; Chairman Milton Mollen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the City Housing Authority ; Paul O'Keefe , Commissioner of Real Estate , and Julius C. C. Edelstein , my executive assistant and personal representative on the Housing Policy Board and its Executive Committee . Their replies added up to an amazingly different story . Circumstances Cited The facts  --  as might have been ascertained by checking with any of these members of the Executive Committee  --  are as follows : The Executive Committee of the Housing Policy Board did not meet at all Aug. 29 , as reported by The Times , but did meet on Aug. 24 , on Aug. 30 and again on Aug. 31 . At none of these meetings , nor at any other meeting of the Executive Committee , was a decision made to cancel ( or even to postpone ) the ceremony celebrating the opening of the four rehabilitated houses on West Ninety-fourth Street . The Executive Committee , at its meeting Aug. 24 , did discuss the ceremony in question in a rather desultory way . It was certainly not deemed an important policy matter , and no aspect of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Executive Committee was to leave to Chairman Reid of the Housing Authority and to Chairman Mollen of the Housing Redevelopment Board the responsibility for deciding on the details of the ceremony . There was no discussion among the principals at this or at any other Executive Committee meeting of possible violence at the time of the ceremony nor of any danger to me or to any other participant . The decision to postpone ( not cancel ) the ceremony was subsequently made by Messrs . Reid and Mollen some time during the week of Aug. 27 , on the basis of a number of technical and procedural reasons  --  entirely unrelated to any fancied threat of violence . we face in New York City are , in fact , common to all big cities today and are world-wide . To meet these problems , new programs and new techniques have been and are needed . We have developed some which are already considered models , such as our laws and programs against discrimination . At the same time , our efforts to cope with the world-wide rise in crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per capita than in any other major city of the United States . In statistical terms on a per capita basis , New York City has a lower crime rate for murders and for rapes than fifteen other major United States cities and a lower rate for aggravated assaults ; including muggings , than nine other major cities . I am proud of our police force . I wish it had less crime to cope with . ROBERT F. WAGNER . P. S. I hereby invite you and your readers to the ceremony signalizing the opening of these houses , scheduled for early next month . New York , Sept. 10 , 1962 . The news story of the cancellation of the Ninety-fourth Street ceremony was obtained from public officials considered reliable by The Times. ? Editor , The Times . Nations We Support Our Aid to Russia 's Neighbors Compared to Her Role in Cuba Bus Drivers on Turnpike To THE EDITOR OF THENEW YORK TIMES : Several times in recent years I have thought of writing a sma1 protest against the senseless driving of bus drivers on the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more impassioned plea since this past week my cousin , his wife and their children were killed by a bus ; said one newspaper report , " as bus tried to overtake car . " Most of us have traveled on the turnpike and know that feeling of apprehension and resignation one gets when a bus is sighted rapidly approaching . Only a senseless society can condone several tons of high-powered steel bearing down on any car . Are schedules more important than human lives ? Why ca n't buses be kept to a fifty-mile maximum speed that can be checked by timing the bus from its entry onto the turnpike to its exit ? Can this regulation be brought home only after one views the twisted wreckage of a car in which members of his family were riding ? STANLEY C. GABOR . New York , Aug. 27 , 1962 . For Youthful Senators TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Listening to those two young men , Messrs . McCormack and Kennedy , plead for the chance to serve their state and country , revives hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be old fuddy-duddies ? PAUL DAVIS . New York , Sept. 5 , 1962.
