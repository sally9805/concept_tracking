txt Letters to the Editor of The Times Letters to the Editor of The Times Our Purpose in Asia To the Editor : In his column of Dec. 29 James Reston urged that we " redefine purposes " in Asia . Have we the grasp of realities to do so ? At the rail junction of Suchow , between the two great rivers of China , the only massive Asian army which could be marched into battle for an ancient regime was broken in late 1948 . Mao 's generals could then parade south , having created the model twentieth-century victory for a movement originally guerrilla . Since then , China has been pushing forward , in painful yet relentless fashion . In post-Suchow Asia the less numerous peoples east and south of the Himalayas may , given enough adroitness and determination , be neutral to their giant neighbor , but they can no longer expect to be permanently antiChinese . Have we not , in the so-called battle for Asia , long been in the position of the Confederates after Gettysburg and Vicksburg ? We may expend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entrench temporarily here and there , and create a Lost Cause for future demagogues . But we can no longer win the war . Because we teach neither Chinese languages nor institutions in our schools , and.have to depend upon stray Commonwealth journalists for news , we do not see what China is . We are a young nation , and have no cautioning memory of China when she is near her natural strength . But that people of 700 million , accustomed by its history to disciplined labor , begins to stir ; a distant nation of 190 million can not expect to control the reverberations , The verdict of Suchow can be reversed only by the destruction of habitable life on this planet . How can we redefine our purposes until we recognize China in this fundamental way ? RICHARD W. REICHARD Associate Professor of History Cornell College Mount Vernon , Iowa , Jan. 3 , 1966 tainment of their objectives redistribution of wealth to a degree is inevitable . MARCUS S. FRIEDLANDER New York , Jan. 6 , 1966 ? To Tax Transit 's Beneficiaries To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subway system is a money-losing operation . The strike has made it clear that the system does not lose money ? rather , that it subsidizes business in the city , state and in the far corners of the nation . Every concern in the nation which feels an economic pinch as a result of the strike and which pays no money for the operation of the system has received services for which it has not paid . A measure of the value of the service is obtained by noting the losses incurred during the absence of the services . The Chamber of Commerce reports a $100-million loss a day in New York City as a result of the strike . Barry Goldwater reports that the economy of Phoenix , Ariz. , has been affected by the strike . If the Chamber of Commerce is correct in estimating the losses , then it seems reasonable and proper that those beneficiaries should pay enough ( say , a 1 per cent tax ) to allow the men who run the subways to obtain a decent wage and not to shift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an effective mass transportation system is essential to everyone in the city  --  the worker , the employer , the investor , the student and the consumer . Now it is up to the political leaders and the newspapers to call for an end to the subsidy paid by Transit Authority workers and travelers to support the remainder of the city and a portion of the state and the nation , and to insist that all share the costs by an equitable system of city , state and Federal taxes . SANFORD GELERNTER Jackson Heights , L. I. Jan. 9 , 1966 ? Bonding Ex-Prisoners To the Editor : The City Department of Labor applauds the program of the Social Restoration and Research Center , as stated by its counsel in a letter published Jan. 3 , to make available to men with criminal records $1,000 surety bonds these men may require for purposes of employment . This , however , does not cope with the broad problem of industry requirements for bonds in much greater amounts . For example , the experience of the Department of Labor Placement Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surety bonds required for truck drivers by the larger firms in the trucking industry range in amounts of $25,000 to $50,000 , and more in some instances . JAMES J. MCFADDEN Acting Commissioner New York City Department of Labor New York , Jan. 7 , 1966 ? Population Control To the Editor : Though brief , your Jan. 4 editorial " Treadmill to Starvation " is a most timely warning , largely unheeded , about what will happen if we do not provide an adequate , humane birth-control program for ourselves and other nations in the immediate future . Unless we slow down the runaway population increase our problems of today will seem like child 's play for those who will live in the world of A.D. 2000 . Unlike many other social problems . which sprang upon an unsuspecting world , the population explosion is giving us ample and grim warning . The world simply can not increase food production fast enough to fill the increased empty stomachs . Full-scale humane birth control ( not abortions ) is the other answer . Who wants to eat ground-up fish , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's dinner ? GRAHAM R. HODGES Pastor , Emmanuel Congregational Church Watertown , N. Y. , Jan. 6 , 1966 ? Pope 's Role in Plot To the Editor : In connection with Lawrence E. Davies 's news article " A Pius Role in Plot'on Hitler Reported " which appeared in the Dec. 31 , 1965 , issue of your newspaper , and in the interest of complete historical honesty , it is worth pointing out that the motives of the German military who were trying to negotiate peace , using the Vatican as intermediary , were not entirely of the highest . These generals wanted peace at that time , 1939 , because they felt Germany was not yet ready to fight a winning war . Their motive was not anti-Nazi in the ideological.sense  --  they were indeed apolitical  --  nor was it pacifist . These Germans were solely hoping to buy time , even if that necessitated the removal of Hitler . The fact that Lord Halifax was part of this " anti-Nazi " group should be Sufficient to make the group 's true motivations at least somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is altogether different from the perspective that Prof. Harold C. Deutsch of the University of Minnesota gave it . IDA R. FEITELBERG Lake Worth , Fla. , Jan. 3 , 1966
