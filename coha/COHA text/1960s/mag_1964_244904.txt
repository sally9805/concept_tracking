Sitting idly aboard an airliner one day in 1956 , a Tennessee theater-chain owner named David Flexer was struck by how much the cabin resembled a screening room . Flexer 's brainstorm : Why not show movies in flight ? He formed a company called Inflight Motion Pictures , Inc. , spent five years developing a compact , shock-resistant projector and screen with the help of Trans World Airlines . <P> <P> TWA began showing movies on its overseas flights in 1961 , has remained the only U.S. airline to show movies in the air , largely because of an exclusive contract it made with Inflight . The line has steadily expanded its movies to U.S. transcontinental flights , has found them a popular drawing card that has helped increase its passenger load 24% since 1961 . Now TWA 's days of exclusivity are nearly over , and the U.S. public is about to be served movies as commonly as meals in flight . Last week American Airlines announced that it will put on its own show for passengers , thus ensuring that other airlines will soon join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tapes in the Cockpit . American plans quite a variety-show offering : closed-circuit TV pictures of takeoffs , landings and scenery below , full-length movies , local TV shows while waiting on the ground and stereophonic music for traditionalists . After convincing itself with a public opinion survey , American got Sony Corp . to make special equipment for its theater in the air . Whereas TWA 's films are flashed on the screen at the front of the cabin from a projector hidden high above the aisle , Sony is equipping American 's planes with a series of 9-in . TV sets-one for each two passengers in first class and one for each nine in coach-with individual headsets and controls . Movies will be transmitted from tapes in the cockpit . The first screenings will be on the Chicago-Los Angeles run , but by the end of September all 45 of American 's Astrojets will be fitted for airborne entertainment . <P> <P> Also on Ships &; Buses . Airline schedules may soon read like movie guides . <P> Pan American this week is running a test flight with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed a similar system , called " Travelvision " for showing movies and television on planes , ships , buses and trains , and within two months will install the first system in a U.S. airline . Flexer 's Inflight has 35 systems working aloft for TWA , another four for Pakistan International Airlines ; it has also obtained a waiver of its exclusive TWA contract so that it can service noncompeting routes , is presently negotiating with one international and four domestic lines . <P> With all this competition ahead , pioneering TWA is thinking of offering half-hour movies on its shorter-distance flights . Hollywood has clearly invaded the heavens ; its problem now is to tailor its products to flying times .
