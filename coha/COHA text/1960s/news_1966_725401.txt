txt Remember that chatty , personally signed letter you received recently from your senator here in Washington ? Chances are the senator did n't write it . He probably did n't sign it  --  or even see it . By Norman Motheny. staff photographer Signing ? by machine Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen 's signature machine handles his volume mail . It is all part of the modern age  --  and the population explosion . Your senatorial reply was probably rapped out in two or three minutes by a $4,000 automated typewriter . From there it was whisked to another machine which scrawled a flourishing signature . Then it was put on a small assembly line where it was automatically folded , stuffed , and addressed . The senators do n't like the system . Nor do they like to talk about it . But most have bowed before the onslaught of hundreds of letters a day . And this year the mail has been heavier than ever . " It 's the worst we 've ever had , " sighed an aide to Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are going to be four or five months late . The only thing we 're staying current with is Illinois . " Switch from the past Mr. Dirksen 's mail , spurred by his filibuster against repeal of Section 14 ( b ) of the Taft-Hartley Act and his proposed prayer amendment , has been hitting 4,000 letters a day . That puts him in first place in the Capitol . About 17 full-time staffers wrestle with this deluge , and they are aided by 14 part-time volunteers . At one time recently it took four people just to open the letters . To help in the battle , the Senator 's office has enlisted eight tape-operated typewriters and an offset printing press . This mechanized approach is a big switch from earlier days , recalls Sen. Carl Hayden ( D ) of Arizona , 54-year veteran of the Hill . There was " hardly any mail " then , he says ? maybe six letters a day . A senator or congressman could dash off his replies in quick order . In the office of Sen. Richard B. Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as recently as 20 years ago a staff of three people was able to formulate careful answers to all the Senator 's correspondents . Today , 13 aides are almost overwhelmed . Over on the House side the mail is not so heavy for each member , although Rep. Wright Patman ( D ) of Texas counts 1,000 or so a day . A more typical figure for representatives seems to be about 100 letters a day . Last October , for the first time , funds were made available for House members to buy $2,000 automated typewriters of their own . These machines are beginning to appear in many House offices now . Like the Senate machines , the ones in the * // *Congress automates to handle mail load // House are operated with punched tape . They are used , for the most part , to respond to mail dealing with legislation or other policy questions . Two categories In a House or Senate office , constituent mail falls into two major categories , " case " mail and policy mail . Case mail , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting his social-security payments , someone else may be squabbling with his draft board , another may need help with an immigration problem . All these are divided among various aides to the congressmen for special investigation . But the bulk of the mail deals with government policy ; voters urging their congressmen to take a certain stand on an issue . First reply personal In a large office , policy mail is usually handled like this : When the first letter arrives on a particular topic , it will probably be shown to the congressman . He will then , in many cases , draft a reply . As other letters come in , staff aides will use this first reply as a guide to compose further responses . Later , if this flow of mail builds heavily , a form letter will be prepared and punched on tape . Thereafter , letters will be answered by machine . In the Senate basement , rooms filled with these machines chatter loudly day and night . Signature machines busily sign between 150 and 400 letters an hour , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , some members on both sides of the Hill valiantly man their desks and read and sign hundreds of letters a day . Mail important One of the most dedicated is Mr. Patman of Texas . Every piece of mail ( excluding bulk mailings ) passes over the congressman 's desk . Each reply gets Mr. Patman 's okay and his signature ? in full . This means long , 10-hour days during the week , another eight hours on Saturday , and about four hours on Sundays . But the congressman , now in his 38th year in the House , stays with it . But the bulk of those 16 million letters that poured into the House last year and the almost 10 million letters to the Senate never individually came before a congressman 's eyes . This may be somewhat disillusioning to the pure democrat . But aides all emphasize the importance their bosses put on the mail . They say the first question many of them hear when their congressman arrives in the morning is : " What does the mail say today ? "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
