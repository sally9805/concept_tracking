A girl can do almost anything she really wants to , do n't you agree ? She can tan instead of burn , look sexy but also look like a lady , have a job that PAYS because she 's smart and still stay fascinating to men . I 've done all these things , and thank goodness there 's one magazine that seems to understand me-the girl who wants everything out of life . 1 guess you could say I 'm That Cosmopolitan Girl . <P> So says the sleek , sexy career girl in the ads for Cosmopolitan magazine , which these days is aimed at readers who are just the opposite : single women , 18 to 34 , who are not knockouts , who are unsure of themselves , who are searching for a man . It is a recipe concocted by Editor Helen Gurley Brown , 45 , author of the bestselling Sex and the Single Girl , and it has turned a humdrum publication of women 's features into a sort of female Playboy . Since the winsome Mrs. Brown took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 900,000 , ad revenues have more than doubled , to $3,600,000 . Mrs. Brown likes to think of her magazine as a " sophisticated older sister . " It is edited , she says , " for the girl who does n't have everything going for her , who has to inch along . " <P> Conquering Sex . The magazine is mainly concerned with the inch-along 's emotional ( read sexual ) needs . There is scarcely an anxiety that may torment her that has not been fully aired in the pages of Cosmopolitan , and she may even have picked up some new ones . Articles tell her how to get married , how to get divorced , how to be a successful mistress , how to make a man of her husband , how to avoid sexual entanglements with Daddy , how to make the most of " brief encounters . " There is no sexual problem , apparently , that is not conquerable . " Shy girls can be the sexiest , " announces the magazine ; so can flat-chested girls : " They substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is something very feline and terrifically exciting about the way a small-bosomed girl moves . " <P> As Cosmopolitan sees it , there is almost no human activity into which sex can not be introduced . Instructions on how to go skiing turn into advice on how to snag a skier . " You 're standing on the left line next to a slim-hipped Nordic god . You produce a cigarette . He 's got to be interested if he removes his gloves in arctic weather and delves through pockets to light you up . " Even archaeological expeditions are happy hunting grounds . " One night , wild and high , " reports a girl who joined a dig in Greece , " we danced Zorbalike steps to records and formed amorous twosomes that lasted until dawn . " <P> It may all be frothy , but Mrs. Brown is in dead earnest . There is such a shortage of available males , she feels , that a girl has to use all her wiles to catch a man . " It is no longer a question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She does . The question is , can she cope ? " To help them cope , Mrs. Brown carefully scrutinizes the copy of Cosmopolitan , has even assembled a " manifesto " on good writing . It warns against the clichs of women 's magazines such as " out of this world , " " She weighed 102 Ibs. soaking wet , " and " Most girls would give their eyeteeth. "
