In house-hungry , comfort-starved Alaska , Shangri-La is a place called POW . Officially , POW is the 400-acre Port of Whittier , located on an arm of ice-free Prince William Sound and back-dropped by the glaciated peaks of the Chugach Mountains , which provide some of the world 's wildest , most breathtaking scenery . <P> POW is only 62 rail miles from Anchorage , but for all the good it does Alaskans , it might as well be in Tibet . <P> Established as an emergency defense port by the U.S. Army in 1943 , it cost $55 million , has now been declared surplus property by the Pentagon ; the Army wants to unload it , perhaps for as little as $800,000 . <P> Indoors Is Unnerving Too . The most impressive of POW 's ten major rein forced concrete buildings is the six-story Buckner , one of the most lavish edi fices ever built by the Army Engineers . <P> It has 273,660 sq . ft. of floor space , houses a 350-seat theater , staff offices , closed-circuit TV system and studio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newspaper office , bank , post office , 17-bed hospital , twelve-man jail , four-lane bowling alley , two 1,000-ft . <P> rifle ranges , an officers ' club and bar , 1,000-man mess hall , kitchens and bakeries , commissary , library , chapels , fully-equipped hobby shop , lounges , dental clinic , five elevators and assorted stor age rooms . <P> The 14-story Hodge building is the tallest apartment house in Alaska , with 177 apartments of up to three bedrooms , bachelor officer quarters for 39 , lounges , 28 laundries , rows of freezers , snack rooms , playrooms and hobby rooms . A network of tunnels connects the Hodge and other buildings , including a schoolhouse with a capacity of 200 pupils . Beyond all this is an assortment of service shops , a boat shop , telephone exchange , gymnasium , fire station , warehouses , steel docks-and a $5,500,000 power plant with enough juice ( 6,500 kw ) to supply a town of at least 2,000 people . The place was designed to accommodate 1,700 residents . In a real emergency it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caretakers . <P> <P> POW 's main disadvantage is the weather . During summers the place is drenched by interminable rains ( 160 inches annually ) ; in winter the temperature rarely drops below 0 F. , but a year 's snowfall has been measured at more than 70 ft . Winter winds blow a steady 80 m.p.h. , with gusts hitting 135 m.p.h . Servicemen there rarely went outdoors in the winter without good reason . Indoors could be unnerving too , since the region is subject to frequent earth tremors . <P> More Cell Space ? Last week in Juneau , the Alaska legislature was considering whether to take the U.S. Government up on its bargain-basement offer . The trouble is , Alaskans can not agree on what they would do with POW if they owned it . Some want to make it the new state capital . Others want to turn it into a tourist resort , or perhaps a sort of deep-freeze Las Vegas . There was a move on to acquire it for a penitentiary ; the state 's jails are now badly overcrowded . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just fill up again with lawbreakers who are now free because of the cell shortage .
