Not since William Tecumseh Sherman wheeled 100,000 Union soldiers south under a May sun 101 years ago have so many Northerners been in such a hurry to get to Atlanta , Ga . Last week the city was under siege from both professional football leagues : A.F.L. Commissioner Joe Foss announced a franchise for an A.F.L. team next year ; N.F.L. Commissioner Pete Rozelle , on Peachtree Street at the invitation of Atlanta 's Mayor Ivan Allen , talked glowingly about N.F.L. expansion to Atlanta by the fall of 1966 . And baseball 's Milwaukee Braves made a hopeful lunge . Already destined to play in Atlanta next year , the Braves offered Milwaukee $500,000 to drop a court injunction and let them carpetbag south to Atlanta 's new $18 million stadium , after next month 's All-Star Game . <P> The circumstances that lured all three groups toward Atlanta were , in a way , the same that impelled Sherman . Atlanta is the hub of the South ; it has fine transportation ( good roads , superb air service ) , and is an important center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks who yearn for major league sport . The closest baseball team of significance is the Cincinnati Reds , 450 miles away ; the nearest pro football is in St. Louis , 550 miles away . The city 's handsome new stadium seats 51,000 for baseball , 57,000 for football . And that is just the beginning . With club owners more interested now in the tube than the turnstile , Atlanta is a TV promised land so hungry for something to watch that Washington Redskin games and major league baseball games are piped in by coaxial cable . <P> The Atlanta Braves will get handsome TV income from Anheuser-Busch and home-brewed Coca-Cola among others ; and J. Leonard Reinsch , who offered the A.F.L. $7,500,000 for a football franchise , happens to be president of Cox Broadcasting Corp. , owner of Atlanta 's biggest station . <P> Ghostly Silence . The television potential , along with the South 's sports-minded population , explains why the N.F.L. 's Commissioner Rozelle is so anxious to beat the upstart A.F.L. into Georgia . The stronger N.F.L. has already lined up equally prestigious backers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndicate dickering for a team : Texas Oilman John Mecom Jr. , Indianapolis Speedway Owner Tony Hulman , Coca-Cola Heir Lindsey Hopkins Jr . So far , Atlanta 's Stadium Authority has been playing it cozy , says only that no decision on rental rights will be made until July 1 . <P> With all those fans waiting in Atlanta , baseball 's Braves are sadly losing both money and prestige in Milwaukee . Powered by such sluggers as Eddie Mathews , Joe Torre and Hank Aaron , the Braves were only 2 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers last week and tasting World Series . Milwaukee could n't care less . Attendance has fallen as low as 913 people at one game , and in contrast to the mid-1950 's when Milwaukee packed in 2,000,000 fans a year , the total this year after 22 dates is only 125,600.
