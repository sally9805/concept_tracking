With wry bitterness , Hondurans call their small Central American republic " the land of the 70s-70% illiterate , 70% rural , 70% illegitimate . " And they might add 70% politically unstable . The military coup that ousted President Ramn Villeda Morales , 54 , was the 136th revolution in 142 years of independence from Spain . Only two constitutionally elected chiefs of state have completed their terms . <P> President Villeda Morales , a pediatrician turned reform politician , almost made it ; the coup came only ten days before elections to choose a new President . It undid six years of hard work to change the banana republic 's image of mud-hut misery , one-crop economics and machine gun politics . <P> Choose Your Flag . Elected in 1957 to succeed a military junta , Villeda Morales made a start on agrarian reform , got $11.6 million in Alliance for Progress aid and used it to launch a modest development plan to educate his 1,950,000 people , build roads and attract new industry . Personally popular and staunchly antiCommunist , he kept Honduran far leftists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infiltrators . " I am asking you , " he once told a labor rally , " to choose between Communism and democracy , between the blue and white flag of Honduras and the red flag of Russia . " <P> <P> What Villeda Morales could not do was pacify the country 's bush-league , 5,000-man armed forces . By a quirk in Honduras ' constitution , the army rates as a semiautonomous agency , dependent on the Congress for funds , but taking orders only from itself . Villeda Morales first alarmed the soldiers by creating a new civil guard that eventually became a 2,500-man personal army responsible only to the President . The gripes grew louder and finally reached the flash point over the government party 's choice of an almost certain successor in the Oct. 13 elections . He was Modesto Rodas Alvarado , 43 , the hardheaded president of Congress who was determined to put the army in its place ; he actually campaigned with a promise to curtail the military 's power . <P> Formula As Before . As rumor of the impending coup spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brass out of it . Last week the Pentagon even rushed in Major General Theodore F. Bogart , of the U.S. Army Forces Southern Command , for secret talks to be sure everyone got the message . But all threats and pleas were useless . Early one morning last week , four air force fighters swooped low over the tile-roofed capital of Tegucigalpa , as troops cut off access to the presidential palace . Villeda Morales ' loyal civil guardsmen put up a vain resistance , and gunfire rattled through the cobblestoned streets . Honduras ' President made a last desperate phone call to Ambassador Burrows for U.S. help . But Washington could not act that fast-if indeed it knew what to do . Over the radio came the classic announcement : " The patriotic armed forces " had overthrown the President " to end flagrant violations of the constitution and obvious Communist infiltration.
