" In no election in at least 25 years has sentiment been so closely divided or opinion so fluid . " So wrote Dr. George Gallup last week after taking his third poll of the presidential campaign . For the first time since the conventions , Kennedy took the lead , if a slight one . Asked which candidate they favor or " lean " toward favoring , 48% of the voters chose Kennedy , 47% Nixon . Only 5% were undecided ( a percentage considered too low by both candidates ) . In Gallup 's first poll , immediately after the Republican Convention , Nixon led Kennedy 50% to 44% . In the second poll the two were tied with 47% . <P> On issues , the Republicans lead 3-to-2 as the party more likely to keep the U.S. out of World War III . But the Democrats are favored 4-to-3 to arrest a declining domestic economy .
