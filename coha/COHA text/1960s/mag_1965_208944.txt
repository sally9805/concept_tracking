Rising to demand a vote of confidence in Parliament last week , Greek Premier George Anthanassiadis-Novas quoted the author of The Frogs , to describe the man who sought to destroy him . Ex-Premier George Papandreou , said Novas , in the words of Aristophanes , was just another demagogue apt for " rousing the mob and terrorizing those who hold contrary opinions . " The chorus of frogs was provided by 145 Deputies of Papandreou 's ( and Novas ' ) Center Union Party , who , instead of croaking brekeke-kex-koax-koax , hooted " Judas ! " and " Traitor ! " at Novas and his ministers . At the end of the debate , they voted the Novas government out of existence . <P> Papandreou himself appeared in Parliament exactly once : to shout a triumphant ohi ( no ) when his name was called in the roll on the vote of confidence , then stalk out dramatically , leaving the chamber behind in cacaphonic chaos . To win his majority , since 24 Center Union Deputies backed Novas , Papandreou needed , and got , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to the 145 votes of Center Unionists who had remained loyally behind their stubborn old leader . Young King Constantine was on the spot , and he had no choice but to talk things over with Papandreou next day . After a 75-minute conference , Papandreou emerged to say only that " I have asked the King to give me the mandate to form a new government . In case that request is not accepted , I have suggested elections within the constitutional limit 45 days . "
