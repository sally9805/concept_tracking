The first explosion came at dawn . The sleepy-eyed citizens of Bolzano , a quiet , German-speaking town in Italy 's Alpine province of South Tyrol , trembled wonderingly out of bed and into the streets . At the second blast , an eerie bluish light flashed over the mountains as a high-tension tower toppled and its 220,000-volt cables short-circuited . For two hours the bombs continued to go off around Bolzano . The stunned Tyroleans slowly realized what had happened . Germanic extremists , who had long been agitating for more local autonomy , had declared private war on the Italian state . <P> Dissension has simmered in the Tyrol ever since the southern half was cut away from the Austrian empire at the peace tables of 1919 and given to Italy . The deal clearly violated Wilsonian principles of self-determination , since the overwhelming majority of Tyroleans did , and still do , speak German and consider themselves Austrian . Ever since Attila , invaders have swooped down into Italy through the Brenner Pass ; but the annexation allowed the Italians to establish a defense line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current troubles began in 1946 , when Austria and Italy renegotiated the original settlement , and Austria won promises that the Germanic peoples under Italian rule would be assured equality and a measure of legislative autonomy . <P> The ink was hardly dry before Tyrolean extremists found cause for grousing . The Italians merged South Tyrol with Italian-speaking Trento province , creating a new , bigger " autonomous " Alto Adige province in which the Italians outnumbered the German-speaking citizens 2 to 1 . The Tyroleans claimed Italians were given all the important government administrative jobs ; German was neglected in the public schools and no longer recognized as an official language . Last year Austria took the Tyroleans ' claims to the U.N. , which directed Austria and Italy to get together and settle the problem . Two tries earlier this year failed , but in preparation for a third try later this month , tacit agreement had been reached on giving the German minority a larger hand in internal affairs . <P> Apparently the terrorists were not willing to wait . All week long the Tyrol 's quiet villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power system . Twenty percent of Bolzano 's electricity was knocked out in the first two days . Whole factories shut down . Cars belonging to pro-Italian Tyroleans were bombed . Only one man was killed , a road worker who was blown apart trying to unstrap a bomb from a tree along the Brenner highway . But police averted a major disaster when they discovered and defused a bomb only an hour before it was set to go off under a dam at Selva dei Molini . The dam 's collapse would have flooded the entire valley . <P> The Italian government declared a state of emergency in Alto Adige , ordered everyone to turn in all private arms , including even hunting rifles . Responsible Tyrolean leaders disavowed any part in the violence , condemned the terrorists , and few Tyroleans showed any great interest in the German-language pamphlets that invariably appeared in the wake of the bombing urging " support for the fight for liberation . " Looking for a ray of hope , the daily Il Popolo sensibly noted : " The terrorists ' acts may result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
