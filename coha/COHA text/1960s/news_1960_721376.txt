txt Roaring around Ford Motor Co. ' s Dearborn , Mich , test track these days is a collection of weird-looking automobiles . Almost chrome-tree and painted dull black , they are heavily plastered with masking tape and cardboard to disguise their true lines . Similar cars are running around the clock at General Motors Corp . ' s Milford , Mich. , proving grbunds and at Chrysler Corp . ' s Chelsea , Mich .. test track . Occasionally , they can even be spotted on public roads in remote regions . The vehicles are pilot models of their makers ' 1961 cars . Their mission : To shake out the last few " bugs " in design , engineering and construction before the 1961 models go on sale to the public a few weeks hence . The cardboard and m'asking tape are used to shield the cars from the public 's gaze until they make their formal debuts . The testing job is an important one . Failure of parts after new automobiles are in service can be enormously expensive . Deep in the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part which costs only two cents to manufacture and less than that to Install on the assembly line . If , however , the engine must be torn down in a dealer 's repair shop to replace the part , the job will cost 5100 . And , since such failures are frequently covered by the warranty agreement . the added expense comes directly out of the auto maker 's profit . Word Gets Around Even more important in the long run : Word of trouble In a new model quickly gets around , and the impact on sales can be severe and longlasting . Much of the blame for disappointing sales of Chevrolet 's compact Corvair has been laid to the fan belt failures , high gasoline consumption of heaters and carburetor icing encountered by early purchasers of the car . In en effort to avoid such experiences , auto makers each year spend more time and money on torturing components and finished cars to find probable trouble spots . Ford expects this year to drive its test cars 17 million miles , compared with 15 million in 1959 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 100 in 1953 . The five major car manufacturers have an estimated 1100 million invested in proving ground facilities covering 22,000 acres of land , paved with 200 miles of special test roads and staffed by 2,500 workers . Parts suppliers , moreover , perform many tests of their own . Among tire producers , for example , U.S. Rubber has a test track In California and Goodyear , Goodrich , Firestone and General all own facilities In Texas . Each auto maker has a somewhat different system dt testing , but usually all tests fall into one of three categories : Evaluation or , as the engineers irreverently put it , " Why people do n't like the car . " Performance , or how well the car does what it was designed to do as far as speed , gas mileage and other specifications are concerned , Endurance , or how far it will go before falling apart . Perfect Is Too Good Manufacturers admit they are n't trying to build perfect cars , with each part guaranteed against failure . They claim that they could not achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief aim is to see that all their cars are safe . A single failure of such a vital part as a steering wheel or brake pedal , for example , is unacceptable . Where safety is not Involved , the determining factor is costa A manufacturer balances the costs of replacing defective parts against the costs of additional testing to eliminate such parts . " About 1 ' failure of a part on cars in production is the limit , " says William R. Rodger , chief engineer-vehicle testing for Chrysler . " Two percent is a catastrophe . " Any component will fail if it is punished enough , of course . So the engineers must be sure their experiments are n't carried too far . " It 's just as costly to overtest as to under-test " explains Philip Pretz , director of Ford 's testing office . " You spend more money and may set too high a standard " that will increase manufacturing costs prohibitively . On the other hand , Detroit 's recent history is full of instances in which cars have been driven hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop trouble as soon as they reached the hands of retail customers . What happens in such cases ? Car makers , usually loquacious when it comes to countering criticism , have a tough time with that question . Corvair 's fan belts were tested for three years in the laboratory without trouble , a Chevy engineer asserts . But 18 months before production , a manual shift was developed and later offered as an option for buyers who did not want an automatic transmission . The manual shift increased strains on the belt during shifts , he adds , especially in the hands of an unskilled driver . Whatever the reason , Chevy has now cleared up the problem . A good way to see how auto makers try to avoid costly mistakes in new care  --  and how some of the bloopers are missed ? is to watch engineers at work on road tests , particularly at their proving grounds . It is here the final decisions are made on a new car . Ford 's facilities are typical . The company has proving pounds at Romeo . Mich. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingman , Ariz. , in addition to its Dearborn track . Ford also has test stations at Sennerstown , Pa. , and Colorado Springs , Colo. , for running tests over public roads . The Romeo grounds include a five-mile , high-speed test oval which Ford says has a " maximum usable speed " of 180 m.p.h . It also has 7% miles of blacktop durability roads with rolling stretches and occasional rough surfaces : another 2 ' . miles of shtirp turns and hills ; eight miles of gravel roads ; test grades up to ate : . and ponds , swamps and " unimproved cross-country trails . " Condensed Mileage Proving grounds are constantly being changed to gear theta to actual driving conditions the average driver will hit . But by having " more bumps per mile . " each test track mile duplicates about 2t miles of public roads . Al H. Esper , former Ford chief test driver and now Ford 's executive engineer-proving grounds , recalls the company 's test roads were about half gravel and half paved 20 or 25 years ago . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Auto companies go to great pains to eliminate in their laboratories many alternate parts before embarking on costly road tests . Vic Hopentan . Ford 's executive engineer-testing laboratories , flips through a thick plastic-band book listing nearly 90 standard tests his laboratory men can perform . Each , he says . is closely correlated to what can be expected on the track . Test labs include machines for bouncing springs , opening and shutting doors , and performing other checks . Wind tunnels and cold rooms are given heavy use . Lab tests are becoming more complicated . Electronic computers now " build " parts math . emetically and check them out even before they are fabricated ; Chrysler since 1957 has built three-eighths size plastic scale models of bodies to test before fabricating one in metal . Testing begins long before cars are put into production . Besides testing pilot production models , Chrysler engineers now are also working on the structural prototypes of 1963 models . Suspension systems are being tested in chassis prototypes . Most of the potential failures will be discovered In this phase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot welds on the body alone may be made . Expensive Prototypes After these tests , Chrysler will build aboin 20 " program cars " if there is a big model change . These hand-built cars  --  which cost $100,000 to $250,000 apiece  --  will be close to what actually will be put into production , but without such details as window lift mechanisms and dash boards . The body and suspension have the longest lead time ( time needed to get from blueprint to production I so work is started there . " We made a change in the floor plan " of the 1962 model this spring , recalls Mr. Rodger , " and were within two weeks of the deadline . " All auto makers test such parts as engines , axles , transmissions and brakes in existing models long before they are needed . Ford , for example , has four Thunderbirds running around the country with parts that wo n't be used until 1065 models , if at all . Checking also goes on long after the new cars hit the nation 's streets . Companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field men around to dealerships to inquire about service problems that come up frequently . When these problems are traced to faulty parts , such faults can be eliminated in cars subsequently produced . As soon as new models are available , most manufacturers run durability tests on their own and competitive makes . Garages at the proving grounds frequently hold as many ' tars of other companies , Including foreign builders , as the auto makers ' own products . By checking other makes , the auto engineers try to learn how well the Ideas of rival engineers are work . Mg out . In spite of all their effort , engineers are the first to admit that things often do go wrong . Sometimes it 's the fault of manufacturing rather than design . But , says Chrysler 's Mr. Rodger , " there are no open and shut cases . " A poorly-made part usually could have been helped by better design ; a poorly designed one can frequently be improved by better manufacturing . Often , claim the engineers , it 's the little things that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And finding the little things is difficult . The Valiant , for example , was plagued by gas fumes entering the passenger compartment during its testing . Engineers closely checked gas connections and body sealing , but could n't locate the trouble , Gas In Air Pipe Then one hot day in Texas . recalls Mr. Rodger , testers pulled into a restaurant for lunch after filling the gasoline tank . When they came out , they found a puddle of gasoline under the car . Heat was expanding the fuel in the tank , forcing it up an air vent pipe . Simply bending the pipe so the gasoline would drip on the road , and not on a car part , solved the problem . In another Chrysler gasoline problem , engineers discovered fumes which rose while the gas tank was being filled , were attacking the plastic taillight lens . They hastily switched to a plastic that was n't affected . One winter , Ford owners found their door locks freezing up . They could n't get out It they were in the car , or get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one because , when their test cars were hand assembled . enough grease from the fingers of mechanics went on the locks to prevent freezing . In the factory , mechanized assembly did n't furnish this film . A little lubricant added during assembly licked the problem . Sometimes a problem for one car is n't a problem for another . Cadillac , says a former engineer , once was plagued by owner complaints of squeaking springs . Engineers could n't understand the complaints : they were using the best materials available , polishing the springs . and tapering the ends . ' Most competitors were not . One day , says the engineer , he was In the shop of a Cadillac dealer who also sold Buicks . The dealer happened to have Oldsmobiles in the shop as well . The engineer pushed down on the front of a Buick ? " we 'd learned Just how to do it by then , " he recalls  --  and It squeaked too . The Olds was even worse . The dealer 's explanation : " Buick and Olds owners do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect it in a Cadillac . " This ended the squeak research . " Spring squeaks , " says another engineer , " are n't dangerous , and unless really bad , do n't affect sales . So we do n't worry about them . "
