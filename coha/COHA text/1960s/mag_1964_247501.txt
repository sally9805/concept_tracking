Where were they ? Headed for Wilmington ? Leaving Cleveland ? Circling Miami ? Such was the pace of Republican William Scranton 's headlong campaign for the G.O.P. presidential nomination that in the minds of aides and newsmen traveling with him in his chartered Electra , places and events blurred . <P> Scranton often prowled the plane , ignoring the FASTEN SEAT BELTS sign , to chat with reporters . Once , he picked up the galley telephone , read over the aircraft loudspeaker system a lengthy statement that got far less attention than it deserved . <P> The Evidence . " Since in politics almost anything can happen from day to day , it would not necessarily be impossible for Senator Goldwater to beat Lyndon Johnson in November , " said Scranton above the Electra 's drone . <P> " But there is such a thing as playing with odds so long that only the most optimistic partisan would have anything but a glimmer of hope . I believe that would be the position of the Republican Party with Barry as the candidate . <P> " Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . Why , then , am I saying it this bluntly now for the first time ? First of all , I am a party man , and I do n't believe I should lightly question the ability of a fellow Republican to win . After most serious thought , I have determined in my own mind that the more serious disservice to party unity and to party vitality would be to keep quiet about it . If for reasons other than a determination to win in November my party is to be steamrollered into nominating Barry-something I do n't believe is going to happen-then at the very least we ought not to kid ourselves about what we are doing . " <P> Insisting that " the evidence against a Goldwater candidacy is so devastating as to be incapable of complete error , " Scranton continued : " In state after state , surveys show that against Lyndon Johnson , Barry would not carry even a majority of Republican voters . " He reeled off the results of polls taken among Republicans , some by independent pollsters , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucci : nationally , 62% of Republicans would vote for Johnson , only 29% for Goldwater ; in New Jersey , 72% of Republicans prefer Johnson , 20% Goldwater ; Maryland , 63% Johnson , 27% Goldwater ; Ohio , 64% Johnson , 17% Goldwater ; Iowa , 52% Johnson , 30% Goldwater ; Minnesota , 46% Johnson , 44% Goldwater . <P> Concluded Scranton : " Barry 's chances in the cities are just unbelievably poor . Yesterday , for instance , we completed our latest check in Philadelphia . Barry Goldwater can count on only 11% of the total vote against Lyndon Johnson . <P> " If Senator Goldwater is nominated , I will support him and work for him , whatever the long odds of his being elected . <P> " On the other hand , I think that if I am the candidate , I can beat Lyndon Johnson .
