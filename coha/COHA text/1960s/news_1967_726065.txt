txt Soedal The New York Times ALBANY , Jan. ** Rockefeller and legislative leaders have reached tentative agreement on the mechanics of a state lottery . The only unresolved issues at this point are which state agency shall administer the lottery and whether the winners shall be chosen on the basis of horse races or straight drawings . All other major details have been generally agreed upon and are as follows : liThe lottery will be run four times a year . ( iTickets will cost $2 and will he sold only in banks ; all banks in the state will be permitted to sell them . CVending machines , which had been suggested in some quarters , will not be used . COn each running of the lottery , there will probably be a few thousand minor winners but only a handful of big winners . Revenue Is Uncertain State officials are estimating that the net annual revenue from the lottery will be $60-million , although they agree that they have almost no data on which to base their forecast , , so it is little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood banks throughout the state , the money will eventually be collected , processed and turned over to the state by a small number of large regional banks , in somewhat the same manner as the sales tax is collected . State officials rejected the idea of letting one " super-bank " control and process the sales in all the banks , a role that the Chase Manhattan Bank had suggested for itself . With the sales tax , eight regional banks do the collecting , among them Chase Manhattan . The banks receive no compensation for their services , but they have the temporary use of // Albany Plans $2 Lottery Tickets and Sale at Banks // : the tax money and can invest it and earn interest on it before turning it over to the state . The lottery , the proceeds of - which will go to the public schools , was approved by the voters last November by a 3-to-2 margin . The Legislature ' must now decide how it should be run . Representatives of the Governor and the legislative leaders have been negotiating for the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of a bill . . High sources said today that since almost all differences had now been resolved the negotiators would start drafting the measure next week . Some problems had risen over suggestions that if the biggest yield was to be realized , the best method would be to price tickets low  --  say at 25 cents or 50 cents  --  and sell them through vending machines in public places . Both legislative leaders  --  the Democratic Assembly Speaker , Anthony J. Tra.via , and the Senate Republian majority leader , Earl W. Brydges  --  rejected this approach on the ground that it would induce children and the poor to gamble on the lottery . The leaders and the Governor generally agree there should be an age requirement for buying lottery tickets , but they have not decided whether it should be 18 or 21 . The questions of which system should be used to pick winners and which state agency should oversee the lottery are not considered serious obstacles to an agreement , but only matters that will take a few more days of negotiation . Until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be based on horse races as it is in the three-yearold New Hampshire sweepstakes , because that would save the state from paying the 10 per cent Federal gambling tax on gross lottery revenue . Congress passed a law , at New Hampshire 's request , exempting state-run lotteries from the tax , provided the winners were determined by horse races . ? However , some officials here , ' including Senator Brydges , have expressed concern that having a large sum of prize money dependent on the outcome of a horse race might tempt " questionable interests " to tamper with the system . Prize money , as now estimated , would total about 35 per cent of a $120-million gross , or $42-million . Another 15 per cent , or $18-million , would go for the costs of running the program , and the remaining 50 per cent , or $60-million , would be the net revenue to the state for school aid .

Those officials who would rather use straight drawings , fishbowl style , than horse races argue that the loss of the Federal tax exemption would be somewhat blunted by not having to give any purse money to the tracks . Others point out , however , that the tax loss , an estimated total of $12-million. would be many Mies the amount of the purse subsidies and much too large to ignore . On the question of which state agency should administer the lottery , Governor Rockefeller . prefers the Department of Tax-. ation because it already has a system of collection with ' trained employes throughout the , state . He feels it is not economically feasible to set up a new agency with new personnel . Mr. Travia , on the other hand . first proposed the Controller 's office as the administrator , but . is now insisting that a new independent state agency be set up to do the job , such as a sweepstakes commission . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that putting the administration in the Taxation Department might lead to overlapping salaries and costs . The Speaker also believes Ithat the number of personnel in a new agency could be kept , at a minimum .
