The ball game was in the 13th inning , and the Los Angeles Dodgers were still locked tight in a 3-3 tie with the Houston Colts . In the Dodger dugout . Manager Walt Alston issued crisp orders to his lead-off batter , Shortstop Maurice Morning Wills- " If you get on , run . ' ' <P> Wills needed no urging . Drawing a walk , he streaked for second on the first pitch , skidded in safely on his belly a split second before the Colt catcher 's throw . Three pitches later , he stole third as well . <P> this time piling in under the bag with a neat hook slide . The rest was easy . A Dodger batsman lifted a pop fly to short centerfield , and Wills came scooting home - again beating the throw-with the run that not only won the game , but for the first time this year put the Dodgers alone at the top of the National League . <P> In the era of the home run , Maury Wills is a refreshing throwback to an older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were won or lost by speed on the bases . In 1915 the late great Ty Cobb set the major league season record by stealing 96 bases for Detroit , and legend has it that " the Georgia Peach ' ' filed a knife-edge on his steel spikes to enforce his belief that " the base paths belong to the runner . " The 29-year-old Wills has the same determined speed-if not the same temperament . With more than half of the season to go . he already has 34 stolen bases to his credit , seems certain to top the record for active players of 56 steals , set in 1959 by Chicago 's Luis Aparicio . So swift and so canny is Wills that he has been caught trying to steal only five times this year , and the experts give him a chance to top even Cobb 's record . Says Alston : " He 's the greatest base stealer I 've seen in the majors . ' ' Green Light for Go . The son of a Washington , D.C .. Baptist preacher . Wills spent nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team brought him up to stay in 1959 . <P> Though he was a good fielder and had a fair batting eye , he was no long-ball hitter . It took him the better part of three seasons and 1,675 times at bat to hit his first major league home run . But in 1960 , his first full year in the majors . Wills stole so many bases ( 50 ) that the Dodgers ' front office presented him with the second-base sack from their home park . <P> The performance put him far ahead of such former Dodger stars as Pee Wee Reese ( 30 bases in 1952 ) and Jackie Robinson ( 37 bases in 1949 ) . Last year Manager Alston held null back by letting him run only on signals-Wills still stole 35 bases to lead the league . This year , says Wills , " I have the green light to run when I please . ' 1 And with a respectable .269 batting average ( 74 hits , all but eleven of them singles ) , the light goes on often .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
