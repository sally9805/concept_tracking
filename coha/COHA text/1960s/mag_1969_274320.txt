Once upon a time , Hollywood was a town without a country . To portray small-town America , camera crews would generally go no farther than the studio lot , where an idealized Main Street stood gleaming in the California sun . It is much to the credit of Director Francis Ford Coppola that he refused to accept that kind of prefabricated fakery . Bundling a handful of actors and technicians into a fleet of cars , he drove from New York to Colorado , filming a story about a young married woman on the run from responsibility . The result , called The Rain People , has such a strong sense of the U.S. as a dramatic character that Coppola 's people tend to melt into the landscape . <P> Natalie ( Shirley Knight ) wakes one morning to a soot-gray New York dawn , turns away from her husband , stares at the ceiling , then makes a quick , silent decision . After a shower and a visit to her parents , she begins her odyssey . Calling her husband from a gas station on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confused and pregnant . She loves him but wants time to think . So she drives slowly through a Pennsylvania autumn , picking up a hitchhiker named Kilgannon ( James Caan ) who turns out to be a retarded college-football player with a plate in his head . He has been promised a job by the father of an old college girl friend , but the girl 's family greets him with ridicule . Another job as a handyman on a reptile farm falls through when Kilgannon becomes so frightened of losing Natalie that he starts to let the animals out of their cages . He even interrupts Natalie 's assignation with a Nebraska motorcycle cop ( Robert Duvall ) , provoking an improbable denouement that obviously wanted to say something about violence in America but winds up merely as death by cinematic accident . <P> Coppola 's other films ( You 're a Big Boy Now , Finian 's Rainbow ) have been overloaded with a kind of lighter-than-air dramaturgy , and The Rain People sadly falls victim to similar sentimental pretentions . The relationship between Natalie and Kilgannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dialogue is sophomoric Salinger , as when Kilgannon explains that " the rain people are people made of rain . When they cry , they disappear altogether because they cry themselves away . " Still , the geography is simply splendid . Coppola seems to sense that lying between the Hudson River and the Rockies is the greatest film set in the world . If only he could have used it to better dramatic advantage .
