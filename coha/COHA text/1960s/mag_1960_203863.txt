" Changes are coming ! " cried Singapore 's fiery Lee Kuan Yew , 37 , on the wild night last year when 80,000 supporters of his left-wing People 's Action Party celebrated its sweep of the island 's first general elections . Seventeen months have passed since Lee and his motley crowd of Chinese , Indian and Malay anti-colonialists took over the internal government of the famed imperial base . The most startling change last week seemed to be the change that has come over Singapore 's revolutionary rulers . <P> Puritans by Exertion . Taking office , they poured out their avenging anti-Western zeal by ripping down Queen Elizabeth 's portrait , slashing British bureaucrats ' salaries , banning juke boxes , comic books and other manifestations of what they called the West 's " yellow culture . " Tieless , coatless puritans presiding over the sybaritic center of the old South Seas , they rapidly got a name as Southeast Asia 's most honest administrators . Certainly their streets were the cleanest . But Prime Minister Lee , a wealthy , Cambridge-schooled Chinese , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to revolutionary socialism since , among other things , it lacks any major industries to nationalize . His revised economic policy : " Teaching the capitalists how to run their system . " <P> To lure back fugitive investment money and to attract new capital , Lee offered five years ' outright tax exemption to new industry . By last week Socialist Lee had landed eight new enterprises led by Shell , which is building an $18 million refinery . <P> The Japanese have started building an $8,000,000 refinery and are making plans for a steel mill . London has promised $20 million to improve the harbor . World Bank and U.N . missions have been in Singapore discussing ways to provide the $110 million outside help needed to complete Lee 's $330 million , five-year plan to turn Singapore into an industrial outpost to rival Hong Kong . Labeling Communists " the ultimate enemy , " Lee has shaken up trade union leadership , set up an arbitration court to cut down on strikes . <P> <P> Lee 's most serious opposition now comes from the left , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placate with government jobs . They are led by fiery young Fong Swee Suan , a secretary of the Trades Union Congress . Last week Fong attacked Lee for " softness on capitalism . " Lee retaliated by summarily ordering Fong to " vacate " his post in the Labor Ministry . <P> Federation by Example . Unlike the leaders of most other restive dependencies , Lee has no interest in seeing Singapore trade its present status as an autonomous state for complete and permanent independence . Instead , he insists that despite Singapore 's overwhelmingly Chinese population ( Chinese outnumber Malays six to one ) , the island 's future lies in joining the Federation of Malaya . With this in view . Lee has made Malay the official language , has appointed as chief of state a Malay personage , Inche Yusof bin Ishak . So far , the Federation itself has been wary : Singapore 's 1,200,000 Chinese would upset the Federation 's racial balance , put the Malays in a minority .                @ @ @ @ @
