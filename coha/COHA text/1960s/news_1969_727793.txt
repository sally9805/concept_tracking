This first story describes strange difficulties involved ? in reporting a strange war . BY JOSEPH BOYCE ( Chicago Tribune Press Service In 1969 : by The Chicago Tribune LAGOS , Nigeria , April 19 ? I had been in this capital city of Nigeria exactly 24 hours when I was arrested . I had left my hotel , the Bristol , in the heart of Lagos to take pictures of the downtown area . The camera dangling from my neck seemed to attract considerable attention but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it and froze into poses whenever I drew near them . One Nigerian who was not fascinated was a sergeant with the army military police . Takes Picture of School Children I had just taken some pictures of school children when he walked up and asked what I was doing . I had seen him looking at me from in front of a large building across the street but had not given his scrutiny much thought . It turned out that the building was headquarters for the army medical corps . The sergeant wanted to know why I was taking photographs near a military installation and demanded to see my passport . I replied that I had not realized that the building , which looked ordinary enough , was a military installation . The sergeant thumbed thru my passport while I explained that I was a reporter from the United States , that I was taking background pictures for news articles , and that I had no intention of breaking any laws . " We are at war , " the sergeant replied . " You can not just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to happen next . Then the sergeant flagged down a passing army car in which a young lieutenant was riding . The sergeant saluted sharply and said , " I was on my post , sir , when I saw this man taking pictures of everything moving in the street . " Boyce Tells Soldier His Side of Story I finally was able to tell my side of the story . The lieutenant instructed the sergeant to take my passport " so that we will know where to get in touch with him if we need to . " For the first time I refused to cooperate . No one was going to keep my passport . The lieutenant did not argue . He told the sergeant to return the passport and to take my name , local address , and the passport number . He then ordered his driver to proceed , leaving the sergeant and me standing in the street . I thought that was the end of the incident but it was not . The sergeant conferred with a private , whom he jokingly called his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter should be reviewed by an officer of higher rank . So into the medical corps building we went . We met another lieutenant who told us to follow him up several flights of stairs . Finally I was ushered into the office of a lieutenant colonel , apparently the man in charge of the outfit . This officer listened to the sergeant 's account of the incident and to my explanation and apologies . I even offered , to let him confiscate the film . Warned Not to Take Photographs Then the colonel directed me to write a note to the effect that I had been warned not to take ' any more pictures near military installations . " If you are caught doing so again , things may not go so well  --  for you , " he said . Then he ordered the sergeant and a private to escort me back to my hotel The private carried a machine gun loaded with live ammunition ? " From America , " he said . Later , an official of the United States information service here told me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cameras and film . Some even had been detained by Nigerian authorities for several days , he said . He suggested that I take no more pictures unless accompanied by a Nigerian military escort . " You see , " he said , " the problem is that here almost anything could be a military installation . " Tomorrow : Lagos  --  a city in the grip of a war and a boom
