The last of Colombia 's big-time bandits is Pedro Antonio Marin , 34 , alias " Tiro Fijo " ( Sure Shot ) , a killer responsible for some 200 murders . In a drive to stamp out the senseless violence that has torn the country 's backlands for almost two decades , an army regiment last May went after the bandit and his gang , but Tiro Fijo escaped . Now he is back in business , more vicious than ever and proclaiming himself a Castro-style guerrilla . <P> One morning recently , Tiro Fijo and 160 men , wearing olive green fatigues in the Cuban fashion , stopped a bus on a country road 200 miles southwest of Bogot ; they sprayed the 24 occupants with submachine-gun fire , leaving 13 dead , including two nuns . The band then marched to the nearby town of Inza ( pop . 1,000 ) , where Tiro Fijo 's men executed the mayor , town treasurer , bank manager and a policeman before looting three stores and a bank . To the terrified townspeople , Tiro Fijo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and not by his nickname , because he is no longer a bandit but a Communist guerrilla fighting for Colombian liberation . At his side was an aide whom others in the band referred to as el cubano . <P> <P> President Guillermo Len Valencia denounced the Inza raid as " violence financed from international fields , " sent 1,000 anti-guerrilla troopers chasing after the killers . Even as the man hunt was underway , new terror struck nearby . Kidnapers seized Harold Eder , 61 , one of Colombia 's richest and most influential industrialists , from his ranch near Cali , beheaded Eder 's police bodyguard , demanded 2,000,000 pesos ( about $145,000 ) ransom , the highest sum in the sordid history of Colombian kidnaping . <P> Many observers blamed the job on Tiro Fijo , though the army somewhat lamely insisted it was the work of a local smalltime bandit . President Valencia sent 3,000 more troops into the area , but at week 's end Eder was still captive and Tiro Fijo still free . Nervous Colombians feared that their torn country was headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to do much about it .
