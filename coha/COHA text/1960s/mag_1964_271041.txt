During a tour of Tokyo eight years ago , Composer Benjamin Britten was introduced to " a totally new operatic experience " -a Japanese No drama . Fascinated by the stark economy of style and the eerie mixtures of guttural chants , drums and flute , Britten decided that it might be interesting to give an English background to the simple tale of Sumida-gawa- a demented mother seeking her lost child . <P> Britten finally brought East and West together last week in a 14th century Norman church near his home in Aldeburgh , a tiny ( pop . 3,000 ) fishing village on the windswept east coast of England . The occasion was the 17th Aldeburgh Music Festival , where right from the start the main attraction has always been Townsman Britten . The premiere was just about to begin when a thunderstorm knocked out the electricity . When light was restored , Britten unfolded his hour-long opera , Curlew River , a moving parable patterned after an English medieval mystery play , but with strong No overtones in its echoes of Sumidagawa , its incantatory music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new " Oriental period " for Britten ? Press and public agreed that Curlew River may not be a major work , but it may well mark a turning point in Britten 's creative career .
