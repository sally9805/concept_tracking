Progress has always been the great bulldozer , demolishing Greek temples for paving stones and palace walls for slums . How in the New World is the graceful Georgian mansion to withstand the shopping center , or the columned grandeur of Pennsylvania Station to prevail against the flat , glass-curtain wall ? <P> But all over the U.S. , citizens are increasingly concerned to hand down to future generations some of the architectural heritage of America 's past , and are joining forces to find the ways and means . Their latest victory , and one of the most notable of all , has just been won in the Connecticut industrial and commuting town of Norwalk . There Civil War Profiteer LeGrand Lockwood spent about $1,500,000 to build himself a 60-room chateau that is perhaps the finest example of Victorian architectural extravagance still standing . <P> <P> Untidy Warren . The four-story granite house is composed of a series of suites grouped around a central rotunda , lit by a skylight that is invisible from the ground . No expense was spared on the interior fittings . Wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust for Historic Preservation : " It has the best frescoed walls I have ever seen in this country , and the lavishness of the marble and wood inlay work almost defies description . " <P> Lockwood finished his chateau in 1867 , barely in time for the financial panic of 1873 , which ruined him . Sold in 1876 to Manhattan Soft-Drink Magnate Charles D. Mathews , it remained in his family until 1938 , when his maiden daughter died and the city took over . The mansion soon served as an untidy office-warren for several city agencies . Voting machines jammed two rooms , old schoolbooks cluttered the marble entrance hall , and the Italian suite was stacked with city records . <P> It was inevitable that the city begin thinking , as cities do , how nice it would be to have a lovely new steel-and-concrete city hall there , with lots of glass and air conditioning and plenty of electrical outlets for the IBM machines . <P> Group Effort . At this point , some of the citizens in what is normally a civically unconscious town began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor Carroll Calkins , some 20 of them started what they called the Common Interest Group , which went to work rounding up popular support to save the mansion from the 20th century and for it . <P> It was a bitter blow for the organizers when the city council decided to pass the buck and put the issue to the voters . Restoration and preservation of the mansion , with the extra money it would cost and the need to find other space for city office work , would certainly be defeated at the polls , they thought . <P> But when the ballots were counted , the results were 8 to 6 in favor of keeping the Mathews mansion as a historic site . Said Calkins last week : " What happened on election day shows that Americans have a far livelier sense of obligation to the past-and to posterity-than many of our bureaucrats have realized .
