" You were wonderful , ' ' said Maria Callas , " but you owe something to me , you know . After all , I persuaded you to sing roles like Lucia . " She was speaking to a big , square-jawed Australian woman named Joan Sutherland , a former secretary who has won a sudden but solid reputation in the Bellini-Donizetti territory that Callas calls her own . Last week Soprano Sutherland , 33 , was appearing at Britain 's stylish Glyndebourne Festival in Bellini 's I Puritani . On the lawn at intermission , as they were consuming their hamper-packed chicken-in-aspic suppers , members of the black-tied audience buzzed that Joan could already stand comparison with the incomparable Maria . <P> Puritani takes place in Cromwell 's England , where the Cavalier hero daringly dupes the Roundheads , but in the process is forced to abandon his betrothed , Elvira , who goes insane . Soprano Sutherland 's triumph last week was that she made her audience overlook the opera 's gothic absurdities and focus on its moments of real beauty , including Elvira 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her splendid " Qui la voce sua soave , " which introduces a mad scene every bit as effective as the more famous one in Donizetti 's Lucia di Lammermoor . Her voice was precise , agile , light-textured and luminous . The London Observer praised her " extraordinary beauty of tone , ' ' and the Daily Mail found in her performance an " almost intolerable poignancy . ' ' <P> Oddly enough , Soprano Sutherland started out in an entirely different style , hoping to be a Wagnerian singer . The daughter of a Sydney tailor , she took her first voice lessons from her mother , a " nonprofessional mezzo-soprano , " won a number of local competitions and with the prize money decamped for London . At Covent Garden auditions , she learned that the Wagner repertory was not for her : " My voice really is n't heavy enough for that , and I soon understood that I 'd been forcing it along a road that was wrong for it . " <P> She heeded the advice of her Australian pianist husband , Richard Bonynge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century Italian bel canto repertory . Now , on the living-room wall of her Kensington home , Soprano Sutherland has a picture of one of her idols : Singer Elizabeth Weichsel Billington , reputedly the mistress of George IV , who almost singlehanded brought bel canto opera to popularity in England in the early 18th century . Joan Sutherland sees no reason why she can not perform the same service in the 20th century . " I will be happy , " says she , " if I can just sing in every opera Bellini ever wrote .
