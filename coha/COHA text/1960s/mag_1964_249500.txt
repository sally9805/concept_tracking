The sight of Farmer Austin Stottlemyer 's 50 handsome Holstein cows moseying down the main street of Antietam Furnace might have seemed properly bucolic to a casual visitor . But not to the natives of the little ( pop . 51 ) Maryland village . Stottlemyer was careful to obey the state law-one farm hand walked in front of the herd and one behind-but the villagers complained that the cows obstructed traffic , trampled flower beds , and left a trail of manure that was not only tracked into houses but sometimes caused children to slip and fall perilously close to passing cars . On their way between barn and pasture , the cows even poked their heads into the village store and let go with a loud moo . The citizens of Antietam Furnace took their case to the circuit court in nearby Hagerstown , won a ruling closing the road to the cows . But Stottlemyer appealed . <P> Last week the cows won a decisive victory . Ruled Maryland 's Court of Appeals : " The age of the auto has not eliminated the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the periodic bovine excursions and their lingering residue occasion some inconvenience and annoyance to them . But the obstruction of traffic for a few minutes , the presence of manure on the highway and the occasional tracking of it into buildings are not inconveniences serious enough in a rural community to call for the restraining power of a court .
