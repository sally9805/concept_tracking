 | What Women Can Do for Peace A CHARMING and intelligent woman has objected that Midge Decter 's article , " The Peace Ladies , " in the March issue of Harper 's was not very helpful . She agrees with Miss Decter that the present activities of the women 's peace organizations ? picketing , mass demonstrations , and such ? are largely irrelevant , and sometimes actually harmful to their cause . " But , " she says , " a great many women , including me , feel strongly that we have to do something to prevent another war . This is a primitive , powerful emotion . It has to find an outlet somewhere ? and if it ca n't be channeled into some constructive direction , it is bound to boil up in irrational ways . " She has a point . The following suggestions are submitted , therefore , in hopes that they may help her and other concerned women to focus their considerable energies and talents in a more useful way . So far these ladies have concentrated almost entirely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results have been frustrating , because picketing can not help in a delicate diplomatic negotiation any more than it can in a brain operation . Moreover , the ladies have no way to put effective pressure on the Kremlin , Peking , and de Gaulle , who are the chief obstacles to a disarmament agreement . Their basic mistake , however , is their assumption that arms are the main , if not the only , cause of war . There is remarkably little evidence to support this assumption . I do not know of any case in which an arms race was the underlying cause of a war ? though in the years before 1914 it certainly did something to inflame more deep-rooted rivalries . The most common historic reasons for conflict have been national ambitions , messianic ideologies ( ranging from the Sword of Islam and the Crusades to modern fascism and communism ) , racial hatreds , a ruler 's dreams of glory , @# or ( as with the Vikings and Homeric Greeks ) simple lust for loot . And when people bent on killing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs and stones ? as India 's Hindus and Moslems demonstrated when their subcontinent was partitioned after World War II . In that flare-up of religious and racial passion , something like a million and a half men , women , and children were slaughtered without benefit of modern arms . Nuclear weapons would of course make another war unimaginably worse than anything in human experience ; but it is not clear that they make it more probable . On the contrary , there is a growing belief in Washington that at least for the moment the nuclear stalemate may be a positive , stabilizing force . It would be a fine thing , of course , if an arms-control agreement can ev entually be achieved ? if only for the enormous savings in money and resources . But it would not be a sure guarantee of peace . I N the future the chief danger of war seems likely to come , not from an arms race or even from the classic causes , but from an element new to history : the pressure of population . Indeed , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate for another forty years , major wars appear to be inevitable . Overpopulation has of course led to war in the past . It was , for example , a main reason why the ancient Greeks invaded Italy and Asia Minor to found colonies , and why the Goths , Mongols , and Huns flooded west from the Asian steppes in successive invasions of Europe . But never before has the pressure of population risen , all over the globe , so rapidly and steadily as it is rising today . If it keeps up , an explosion is inescapable ? just as it is when the steam pressure in a boiler climbs above the bursting point . A glance at the accompanying chart shows why this is so . For many centuries the number of  | @# human beings increased very slowly . Then , about 1800 , it began to shoot up like a rocket . In roughly a million years between the first appearance of man and that date , the total reached about one billion . In the century and a half since then , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years it seems certain to double again . The explanation has been documented in countless books : how modern medicine and sanitation sharply cut the death rate ? especially deaths among young children ? while the birth rate kept right on . So what ? Up till now ? so the Micawbers among us say ? we have managed to take care of a trebled population pretty well . Maybe something will turn up before it trebles again . God will provide . . . . Such happy optimism is hard to maintain if you look at a few facts . In 1800 , fertile continents were still largely empty ? most of North America , Australia , and Latin America . Today no continents are left . Small patches of not-yetovercrowded land still survive , here , in Canada , Southeast Asia , Siberia , and a few other places ; but they are filling up fast . Nor is it true that the world 's multiplying population has fared reasonably well . While living standards have risen since 1800 in this country and Europe , in other places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , and many Latin Americans do n't eat as well now as they did then . For it takes two acres of land to feed a person adequately . ( Not well ? just " adequately . " ) Yet we have only about one acre of food-producing land for each person on the globe ? and we are adding 55 million hungry mouths every year . We ca n't possibly add farmland that fast . Every new acre now has to be won , at heavy cost in labor and investment , from the deserts and swamps ; while at the same time other acres are being lost through erosion and overcropping . In fact the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN ' reported last October that there had been little if any increase in world farm production during the previous year , so that somewhat less food actually was available per capita . That meats that a third or more of the world 's people already are hungry most of the time ? but not as hungry as they are going to be . Conceivably by heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algae , perhaps , and the large-scale harvesting of seaweed ? mankind could double food output in the next forty years , thus keeping barely even with population growth . But even if this improbable feat could be accomplished once , it obviously can not be repeated indefinitely . Since the surface of the globe is strictly limited , the " Standing Room Only " sign will have to go up eventually ? and much sooner than most of us realize. * CHINA , where such facts press the hardest . has now become the most dangerous nation . Already it has a fifth of all the people in the world , and it adds 22 per cent every decade . Thes are crammed inside a territory which is bards
