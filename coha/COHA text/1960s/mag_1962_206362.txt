If the South had forty editors like W. 0 . Sounders , it could be rid of most of its problems in five years . <P> -H . L. Mencken <P> William Oscar Saunders was in the old tradition : a personal journalist , a high-horsed crusader , a one-man crowd . For 30 years , as editor-publisher of a rural North Carolina weekly , he unremittingly fought graft , corruption , red-neck segregationists , pharisees of all kinds-and some 60 libel suits . Last week , in a book entitled The Independent Man , Saunders ' only son , Keith , 52 , now an aviation writer in Washington , recalls the turbulent career of one of the last of an all but vanished American journalistic breed . The Elizabeth City Independent , which Saunders launched in 1908 on a borrowed $300 , ran head-on into trouble from the start , and stayed there . Saunders offended the town , which was deeply religious , with some of the most irreverent news coverage ever committed to print . BRIDE OF THREE WEEK 'S BEATS ASS OFF HUSBAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young farm wife in neighboring Camden County had bravely rescued her husband from an aggressive jackass . Even the clergy was not immune from attack . After one Baptist preacher denounced him from the pulpit , Saunders discovered and published the fact that the preacher owned the only bawdyhouse in town . Another Independent editorial volley , aimed at an anti-Semitic evangelist named Mordecai Ham , blew down the revivalist 's tent . <P> Retracting a Libel . Saunders reserved his most withering fire for more vulnerable targets : corrupt politicians , indolence in public office , the outmoded mores and traditions of the Old South . " E. F. Aydlett. " read one two-line item about an Elizabeth City attorney who controlled the town , " was seen in the courthouse one day last week with his hands in his own pockets . " Aydlett tried to bribe Saunders into silence , with no more effect than those who resorted to threats , legal action and even violence . Walter L. Cohoon , editor of a competitive paper , twice thrashed Saunders on Main Street and also sued him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , Cohoon had to drop the suit when Saunders printed this impenitent retraction , WALTER COHOON IS NOT A BRAYING ASS . Subsequent Independent exposures of Cohoon 's shenanigans led to his conviction as an embezzler . " The trouble with the Independent , " its editor once wrote , " is that it has always been 15 to 20 years ahead of its time . ' ' The paper scoffed at Woodrow Wilson 's illusions about " a war to end all war , ' ' called for diplomatic recognition of Soviet Russia in 1917 , and advocated birth control-in an area whose champion father sired 34 offspring . It badgered local officials into passing and enforcing some of the most stringent pure milk , water and meat ordinances in the state .
