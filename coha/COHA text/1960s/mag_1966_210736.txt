TIME and its reporters were banned in Indonesia in 1961 , and President Sukarno has never been secretive about his opinion of our coverage , which sharply delineated the country 's downward slide under his capricious rule . The situation drastically changed last September when an attempted Communist takeover was put down by the army , and the generals began to maneuver Sukarno into the background . <P> The new military regime lifted the ban on TIME . Bangkok Bureau Chief Louis Kraar flew into Djakarta to witness the mopping-up operations of Lieut . General Suharto 's troops and the radical political changes that the military were setting in motion . After two weeks , the door closed again and Kraar had to leave . In the sub sequent tense weeks of struggle between Sukarno and the army , we found other ways of keeping informed . This week 's cover is the 23rd story that we have run on Indonesia since the attempted coup . <P> When Sukarno was finally forced to pass on his powers to the new regime in March , the TIME ban was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American reporters to return . Sukarno spotted him and exploded . " I 'm so angry , " he sputtered , " I do n't want to talk to you . " <P> Key men in the new power structure , as well as Sukarno 's pretty Japanese wife , were willing to talk to Kraar as they were to talk with Senior Editor Edward Hughes when he toured Indonesia last April . Kraar , who has spent eleven weeks in Indonesia since September , was joined by Frank McCulloch , chief of the Hong Kong bureau , and Singapore-based Stringer Dan Coggin . In a six-week , 6,000-mile swing , Coggin covered Java , Bali , Sumatra and Sulawesi . The correspondents ' massive reports furnished the material for Writer John Blashill 's story . <P> As Sukarno 's political powers waned , so it seemed did his chronophobia . At a palace reception , as he was boasting how he had banned Beatle music and Beatle haircuts , McCulloch 's gleaming pate caught his eye . " Haw , " beamed the Bung , " this TIME and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does he ? " Then he leaned close to McCulloch and , as though imparting a state secret , whispered : " But do not worry , my friend . Grass never grows on a busy street . " <P> LAST week the American Bar Association announced its Gavel Awards , and once again TIME ( with Look ) won the honors in the magazine category . TIME also received a 1959 Gavel for its May 5 , 1958 cover story on the rule of law . <P> The Gavel Awards are given for " distinguished service " in communicating to the public " the basic values of our legal and judicial systems . " TIME was cited for its regular coverage of these systems in the Law section - which is written by Robert Shnayerson and edited by Richard Seamon - plus a specific citation for the July 16 , 1965 Essay , " The Revolution in Criminal Justice . " <P> In a letter to Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan , A.B.A. President Edward W. Kuhn said : " The competition for awards this year attracted the second largest number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you have every right to be proud . " We are indeed .
