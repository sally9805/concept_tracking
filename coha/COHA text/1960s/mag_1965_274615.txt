Though it is the world 's biggest corporation , and earned $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 1965 , the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. is not exceptionally profitable . Its return of only 8% on invested capital ranks it 43rd among the 50 largest utilities . By contrast , General Motors , which last week announced nine-month profits of $1.54 billion , the highest of any company ever , collects 22.8% on its capital . Reason for A.T . &; T. 's modest return : as the nation 's No. 1 private monopoly , it is sternly regulated and frequently investigated by Federal and state governments . Last week the Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to begin history 's broadest investigation of the Bell System 's interstate and foreign rates , costs and earnings . <P> The FCC suspects that Bell may be charging too much for some services , too little for others . With its usual sympathy for Bell 's smaller competitors , the Commission has been aroused by a complaint from Western Union that Bell is undercharging for services in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.4% on the private-line telegraph service and 4.7% on the private-line telephone service that it sells to business in competition with Western Union , but gets a return of 10% on interstate telephone services which it monopolizes . The FCC will also investigate whether A.T . &T.; pays unnaturally high prices for the equipment that it buys from its satellite company , Western Electric , in order to inflate its expenses and thus justify unreasonably high rates . <P> Sensing that any Government probe would call for lower rates and profits , many of A.T . &; T. 's 2,674,141 investors sold stock , pushing A.T . &; T. shares into a paper loss of $792 million before they recovered mildly at week 's end . Actually , the FCC may well order A.T . &; T. to raise some rates to take the pressure off competitors . Whatever comes of the investigation , which will last about two years and tie up considerable company talent , A.T . &; T. does not stand to suffer much . Twice in the past two years it has reduced longdistance rates under FCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A.T . &; T. might well be able to pare long-distance rates still further , but a fat slash would create so much new business that it might lead to one big busy signal .
