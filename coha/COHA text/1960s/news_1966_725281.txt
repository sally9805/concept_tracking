txt What 's ahead . Northwest fishery experts are deep in a knit-browed search for ways to cool the Columbia River and take the heat off the salmon . The Columbia , one of the world 's last major spawning grounds for seagoing salmon , may be literally " cooking " itself out of that distinction . In less than 35 years , more than 700 miles of the Columbia 's main stem have been dammed into lakes warmed by the sun . The same thing is happening on the Snake and other Columbia tributaries . And the nuclear fuel plant at Hanford , Wash. , on the Columbia 's banks has been using and warming the river 's flow . Fishery authorities now say if something is n't done the Columbia 's temperature will hit 85 degrees by 1980 ? about 8 degrees too warm for salmon survival . Already thousands of migrating salmon have been lost in the warm lakes impounded behind the Columbia River dams .

Eight western states are banding together to peer at 1980 . They will be asking , then trying to answer , two key questions . What will it be like then ? And what must be done to plan for it ? The study will embrace the eight states of the Rocky Mountain region  --  Colorado , Wyoming , New Mexico , Utah , Arizona , Idaho , Nevada , and Montana . All will participate . The 42-month-long study will headquarter in Denver , but each state will maintain coordinating offices and directors . Some 30 or more experts in various disciplines will prepare papers looking ahead in their fields to 1980 . The effort is being propped by a $1 million grant from the United States Office of Education . Its ultimate aim is to gear education to cope with the expected changes . Democratic intraparty fires are about to flare again in California . The California Democratic Council ( CDC ) will meet next month in Fresno .

San Francisco 's billion-dollar Bay Area Rapid Transit project , called BART , may be losing its luster as a national showcase for do-it-yourself financing . Work on the three-county system 's 75 miles of tracks , tubes , and tunnels is dropping months behind schedule . Costs are running millions above BART estimates . And more trouble may lie ahead . The project just barely squeaked by the voters in the first place . It needed a 60 percent majority and got just less than 61 percent . And the decision to tap Bay Bridge tolls to pay for the transbay tube has piqued many bridge users . Now even the $133 million expected in bridge tolls wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bid for " breather " caissons at either end of tube went way above BART 's estimates . What if the same thing now happens with bids on the entire transbay tube ? BART then will either have to risk going back to the voters hat in hand for more funds , ask the state Legislature to tap more bridge tolls , or pry money from Congress . How and why .. Oregon has a corner on the earth 's first mail-order business in " moon rocks . " Lunar geologists figure a small field of exposed volcanic rock in the Oregon Cascades near Bend comes closer than anything in the United States to the anticipated surface of the moon . Samples from the outcropping are in great demand . A ton of the field 's five different kinds of rock has been shipped to the Bureau of Mines Research Center in Minneapolis . A 10-ton volcanic block went to the Martin Company in Baltimore , which is designing the tools astronauts will carry to the moon . Samples from Oregon 's Moon Country have gone to Grumman Aircraft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of evidence : There is n't a bit of green cheese anywhere in the Bend lava beds.
