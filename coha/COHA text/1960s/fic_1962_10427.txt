/ SEVEN DAYS IN MAYnext year . I know there 's an election coming up , but we senators of the United States are feeling a little pushed around after that row on the treaty . " " Spoken like a true Senate man , Ray , " Lyman said . " I do n't suppose you did any of the pushing ? " " Why , Mr. President , I would n't say that , now . I may have helped some of my colleagues reason together a bit , but no more . Anyway , there wo n't be anything much doing on the Hill for three weeks now , with the recess starting . I 'm in the clear myself except for an armed services meeting tomorrow to find out what will be left of our defenses after you take the bombs away . " " Scott going to be there ? " " Yessir , Gentleman Jim himself is going to deliver the overallreport and then we 'll hear in detail from the Navy on its plans . " " Well , if Prentice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep an eye on him . Give me a ring if he says anything interesting , will you ? " Clark got up from the table . " Sure will . By the way , what do you hear from Doris and I , iz ? " " Doris called last night from Louisville , " said Lyman . " Liz 's baby is due in a day or two . Certainly this week . Potential grandpas get kind of excited , Ray . " The Lymans ' only child , Elizabeth , had been married a week before his own inauguration . " We could use a little one right now , " said ( ' lark . " Why waste your first grandchild on a week when you 're riding high in the polls ' ? " " Liz is a great little politician , " said Lyman affectionately . " I think she 's tinting it perfectly for Pop . " " Give ' em both my love , " said ( ' lark . The two friends headed for the west wing . Lyman dropped off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors ' lobby . There were only two reporters on the job at this early hour , but they both wanted to know how the President felt about the new Gallup Poll. 41 / MONDAY " I never quote the President , " said Clark . The lazy smile spread over his face . " But you can quote me , if you 're hard up . Twenty-nine per cent of the people still think Truman lost to Dewey in 1948 . " Lyman settled himself behind the big desk in his office . A moment later Paul Girard popped his head through the door from his adjoining cubbyhole . Lyman looked at him and shook his head . " I can tell by those eyes , you did n't get to bed early , " he said . " Where were you last night ? " " In the camp of the enemy , " Girard said , shaking his big , ugly head morosely . " I dined , or rather drank , at the home of Stewart Dillard , lobbyist for Union Instruments . " " Watch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember Sherman Adams and Matt Connolly . " " If I promised anybody anything last night , I ca n't remember it this morning , " Girard said . " Anyhow , I spent most of the time listening to that bastard Prentice proclaim his undying loyalty to you . " " I 'll bet he did . Well , we can console ourselves in the knowledge that no one else likes him either . " " General James Mattoon Scott ought to love him , the way Prentice was talking about him last night , " Girard grumbled . " Christ , the way he makes it sound , you 'd think Scott could walk on water . " He pulled a white , five-by-seven card out of his pocket and slipped it into a holder on Lyman 's desk . " There 's today 's line-up , Mr. President . The first batter is Cliff Lindsay . He 's due at 8:40 , or a minute and a half ago . " " Hold him up for a couple of minutes , please , Paul , " Lyman said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switch on his intercom box as Girard left . " Esther ? Please get me the Vice-President . Yes , he 's probably still at home . " A red light winked beside his phone and he pushed the proper button. 42/ SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " Vince ? Yeah , I know . I saw it too . How about coming down for lunch ? You can cheer me up . I want to talk about your trip , too . 12:30 okay ? Fine . Thanks , Vince . " Cliff Lindsay , president of the AFL-CIO , bowed slightly to the President as Girard ushered him in . He said nothing as they shook hands and Lyman motioned him to a chair . " You sent for me , Mr. President ? " Lindsay 's tone was totallynoncommittal . " Yes , I did , Cliff . Those strikes at the missile plants on the Coast do n't make any sense at all to me . The men are getting good wages . There are no valid grievances that I can see . Maybe there 's something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in . " " You 've been getting your story from the Secretary of Labor , " Lindsay said stiffly . " We do n't consider him exactly an unbiased source . " Lyman smiled . " You mean he 's too pro-labor ? " " If that 's intended as a joke , Mr. President , I can assure you the executive council wo n't take it that way . " " I can assure you this is no time for jokes , " Lyman answered , his own tone now sharp too . " I want you to tell me why those men are on strike . " " It 's no secret , Mr. President . Sure , it 's a jurisdictional dispute . The sheet-metal workers get into a row with the aluminumworkers , the Teamsters side with the sheet-metal guys and next thing you know the jobs are picketed . Maybe it 's not the best beef in the world , but that 's no cause for your Secretary of Labor to start hollering that labor is irresponsible . He knows damn well that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Secretary made the statement with my approval , " the President said . " Cliff , I 'm sick and tired of the Federation 's all-or-nothing attitude . " Lindsay 's face was passive , but his blue eyes darted around the room angrily . " If we were all last time , " he said slowly , " we could be nothingnext time . " 43 / MONDAY " If that 's a threat , " Lyman said , " I must say your timing is poor . If we do n't show some unity now , with the Russians watching us over this treaty , there might be no next time . " " You got to give me time to work this thing out , " Lindsay said , less aggressive but still stubborn . " I 'll give you a week , " Lyman said . " If you ca n't clean it up by next Monday morning , I 'll have to send the Attorney General into court . " He escorted Lindsay to the door . Again the union chief took the offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cliff was all right , and he had a few political problems of his own . Lyman buzzed for Girard . " Paul , tell those West Virginia people that the Secretary of the Interior will handle the Rhododendron Queen . Tell them I 've got a special Security Council meeting or something . " " Any real reason , Mr. President ? " " Yes , dammit . I need to plan some strategy and if I 'm going to do it , I need to think  --  for a change . " Girard bowed slightly , grinning . Lyman knew no other man who could smile with quite that mixture of cynicism and warmth . " I know , boss , " he said . " It comes over all of us now and then . " Jordan Lyman knew he had handled Lindsay right and was sure he had come out ahead , but he was angry and frustrated . I came into office after that mess in Iran had this country 's stock down to almost nothing , he thought . I had to do something about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarmamenttreaty , something every President since Teddy Roosevelt tried to do , and I got one . What do I get ? Labor is down on me . Business has always been hostile , and now that they 'll have to make something besides nuclear warheads they 're madder than ever . And if you believe Gallup , the public  --  whatever that is  --  is mad too . It was hard for Lyman to understand the country 's apparenthostility toward the treaty . Neither he nor anyone in his administration would ever forget the wave of relief that44 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYswept the nation and , in fact , the world the day the treaty was signed . A photographer had snapped a picture as Feemerov left the United States embassy in Vienna after the all-night session that buttoned it up . Lyman and the Russian , shaking hands on the steps , were haggard and unshaven after the final bargaining , but morning sun flooded the scene with the promise of a new day . The picture was printed in every city in the world . Men looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their shoulders , and wept . But later the reaction set in . He began to understand how Wilson felt after Versailles . No matter how many times you explained , publicly or privately , the safeguards so painstakinglybuilt into the treaty , someone always made a splash by charging " appeasement " or " sellout . " The Senate debate on ratification gave every member of the lunatic fringe plenty of chance to rant . People started to worry about their jobs , as if the United States could n't prosper without making bombs . As if Marx and Lenin and Khrushchev had been right . God knows , Lyman thought . I do n't trust the Kremlin either . That 's why it took seven weeks to negotiate that treaty instead of seven days . But how can we possibly lose ? If they cheat , we know it and we 're hack in business on twenty-four hours ' notice . We do n't dismantle a single bomb until they do . And it had to he done . That was the one thing that finally compelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies to do likewise . With atomic weapons already stacked like cordwood and Peiping boasting of a third hydrogen test , there was n't much time left . This country will understand that eventually , he thought . I hope to God it does n't take too long , but they 'll understand . President Jordan Lyman could lament the fickleness of public opinion , as this morning , and still retain his faith in the eventual soundness of collective public judgment . He had thought it out often during a public career that ran from district attorney through state senator , state attorney general and governor to the White House . Question : How do you know that the electorate will wisely exercise the power it is45 f MONDAYgiven in this republic ? Answer : You do n't  --  but it always has , in the long run . Lyman 's wrestle with the problem was no matter of past decades , either . Even now the windows of his study were lighted late on many nights while he sat inside , feet propped up , shoulders pushed back in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , from Jefferson'sletters to Eisenhower 's press conferences . He rarely went back from his office to the mansion at night without picking a volume off the shelves in the Cabinet room that held the writings of the Presidents . Most .. eople took the American . system . for granted even while they proclaimed its perfection . Lyman pondered it , questioned it , wondered about it , and so knew why it worked so well . The intellectual curiosity that led Lyman into this long study , and the knowledge gained from it , also gave him a poise and balance that served him well now . He could lose his temper , but he never made an important decision when he was angry . He would weigh the pros and cons of an issue until his aides were in despair , then make up his mind and never waver again . Yet even as he stayed on a course so carefully charted , Lyman could always make himself see the other side . This was not modesty but breadth of understanding , although it did not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that under certain circumstances GeneralScott or Secretary of the Treasury Christopher Todd , the " brain " of his Cabinet , might have made a better President than he . Lyman did not find it necessary to add , on such occasions , that under existing circumstances he was better fitted for the job than they . He knew it . Those who heard his remarks , however , sometimes wondered whether he was afflicted with self-doubt . Lyman , having thought it out , would have been willing to disabuse them of this notion if they had asked about it . But they did not , for the associates of the President of the United States do not voice such notions to him , and so the question lingered in their minds  --  and perhaps in the mind of the public too . Certainly Lyman was a good deal more complex than one46 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYwould guess from a glance at his record , a record of unbrokenpolitical triumphs in every election he ever entered and of consummate skill as well in the art of back-room politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the man who came to Chicago with the greatest number of first-ballot votes . Lyman , accompanied by Clark , simply took a back elevator to Vince Gianelli 's room and told him he could not possibly win the nomination . Gianelli exploded indignantly , but Lyman , who of course had thought it all out before , explained the situation to Gianelli so preciselythat the only remaining question was whether the New Yorker would accept second place on the ticket . He did , within the hour . Lyman 's race against President Edgar Frazier that year was never a contest . He won it at the very start with a single sentencein his speech accepting the nomination : " We will talk till eternity , but we 'll never yield another inch of free soil , any place , any time . " The Republicans could never overcome the public distaste for the Iranian War and the national revulsionagainst the partition that ended it . They privately derided the Lyman-Gianelli ticket as " The ( ' op and the Wop , " trying to turn Lyman 's pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Democrats . The analysts guessed later that this whispered slur cost the G.O.P. more votes than it gained . The Democratic ticket carried all but seven states in the first real landslide since Eisenhower . Yeah , Lyman thought , I carried forty-three states a year and a half ago . Now I 'm trying to do something for all those people , and I do n't think I could carry ten states today . He walked into his lavatory , splashed cold water on his face , and wiped it dry . " Listen , Lyman , " he said aloud , " there 's life in the old bird yet . You 'll bring this thing off . You 've got to . You ca n't let the world down . " There you go again , he thought , talking to yourself , trying to sound like the big shot . Knock it off , Jordie , you 're making an ass of yourself. 47 / MONDAYLyman went back to his desk and began reading the intel- ligence reports left for him by his military aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a college professor . At fifty-two , his rather long face was less wrinkled than seamed . His curly hair was thinning back from the temples and was streaked with occasional strands of gray . Although he had it trimmed weekly and kept at it with a comb , the hair had a wiry quality that made it appear perpetually tousled . Colorless plastic frames held his glasses on a prominent nose . He was not a tall man , standing an inch under six feet , but oversized hands and extremely big feet , appended to a rather thin body , gave him a gangling appearance . No one would call him handsome , but he looked like a man who could be trusted  --  and no politican could ask more of his own physique . The President read and signed the stack of mail his secre- tary had left for him , holding out a couple of letters that were n't quite right so that he could dictate new versions . He was well into another pile of mail when Esther Townsend came in . She had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was attorney general of Ohio , moved into the governor 's office with him and inevitably accompanied him to the White House . No one else on his staff knew Jordan Lyman as well as this tall , blonde girl with the light-brown eyes and the wisp of hair falling over her forehead . She knew him so well that she rarely had to ask what to do with a problem . He knew her so well that he never had to worry about her judgment . " The Vice-President is here , " she said . " Do you want some more time to yourself ? " " No , thanks , Esther , " he said , " I 've done all the thinking that a man can stand in one day . Tell the kitchen they can bring lunch over here . " Over that lunch the two leaders commiserated on the evi- dent ebb in the administration 's popularity . " I have n't sold the treaty to the country , Vince , " Lyman said . " I 've been too busy selling it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Italy I 'll have a plan . We 'll work48 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYout of this , do n't worry . We can . We have to , because we 're right . " " I 'm not faulting you , Mr. President . So Gallup puts us down . So what ? It 's one of those things . A couple of months from now , you 'll be a hero . " " You 'll be the hero this week , Vince . Home-town boy makes good . " Lyman blew him a kiss , bravissimo . " Say , where 'd you dream up that weekend in your grandfather 's village ? That 's a great idea . " Gianelli beamed , winked and waved his arms , never missing a beat as his fork propelled meat loaf into his mouth . Lyman could never quite get over Gianelli 's appetite and the haste with which he appeased it . But as Vince had once said : You want Ivy League manners , you should have picked someone from Princeton to run with you -- and lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who cooked that one up ? Prentice , that 's who . I had it worked out to stop Saturday in Corniglio , you know , just run up on the way from here to there , make a little speech . So last Friday Prentice comes up to me in the cloakroom and says what am I going to do in the old country ? And I give him a rundown . All of a sudden he sticks that finger in my face , the way he does , and gives me a big song and dance about tradition and sentiment and the Italo vote . He should tell me about that . But he says why not give the home-town thing a little more moxie and spend a couple of nights there ? It 's a natural if I ever heard one , no matter who thinks it up , so I buy it quick and yesterdaythe boys leak it to the papers . " " Prentice is sharp , all right , " Lyman conceded dryly . " He made enough trouble for us over the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this simmers down some . I know , I 'll never trust the bastard either , but an idea 's an idea . Right ? " " Right , Vince . You going up to what's-its-name has real charm . " " Moxie , " Gianelli corrected . " Okay , moxie , " Lyman agreed with a grin . " And moxie we can use right now . " 49 / MONDAYTheir talk drifted into small political gossip . Gianelli frequentedthe Senate cloakroom and the Speaker 's rooms over in the House and he regularly brought Lyman an assortment of useful , if not always particularly elevated , nuggets of information . The Vice-President stowed away a pineapple sundae , patted his stomach , and rose to go . " Cheer up , chief . From now on , things will start looking up . " He waved from the door . " Arrivederci , Mr. President . " After he left General Scott 's office , Casey concerned himself with strictly military matters in the strictly routine way with which he began each day . While the chairman conferred with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of messages , inquiries and receipts for orders that had accumulated since his relief from duty the day before . Selectingthose that required Scott 's attention , he added them to the Sunday stack and presented himself at the E-ring office shortly after the British Chief of Staff had left . Scott , puffing on his first cigar of the day , was in good humor . Casey could almost feel himself basking in the General'sradiance , as though he were standing on a beach in the first full heat of the morning sun . It was a rare man who , once within range of Scott 's personality , failed to feel better for it . " You look pretty chipper , Jiggs , for a man who had the Sunday duty . " " Marge and I stepped out last night , General . Pretty good party at the Dillards ' . I think you 've met him . He 's Union Instruments ' man here . " " Anybody I know there ? " Scott asked . " Yes , sir . Paul Girard from the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . " Scott examined the thin column of cigar smoke wavering in the uncertain eddies of the air-conditioning currents . He chuckled . " With those two , " he said , " I 'll bet there was a small goroundover the treaty . Prentice uphold our side all right ? " " He was pretty candid , sir . Also quite complimentary about50 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYyou . " Now , why this line of questions ? Casey wondered . Scott must have covered all this last night with Prentice at his quarters . Unsure of his ground , Casey turned to business . " Here 's the message file , General . And I wondered if you would n't want to invite a couple of Congressional people to observe the All Red , sir ? It might not hurt us on the Hill if the leaders saw just how smoothly we can work when we have to . " Scott pressed his palms hard against his desk , fingers spread , the nails white where he pushed them against the wood . Casey had long ago noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes clenching the fist , sometimes pressing on an object , often simply pushing the heels of the hands against each other . He looked at Casey for a moment , then studied the ceiling briefly before he answered his question . " No , Jiggs . I want to test our security as well as our readiness , " he said . " Right now , nobody in Congress has a hint of it , and I want to see if we can keep it that way . " Casey was on the verge of blurting an objection  --  that SenatorPrentice already knew about the alert . But , again remembering the odd meeting at Fort Myer last night , he decided not to . Scott looked at his watch . " Time for the tank . Walk over with me , and then wait awhile . We may have some questions you can help us on . " " The tank " was the big conference room used by the Joint Chiefs . The name memorialized the depressing effect it had had on several generations of occupants . Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rug as " disappointedmustard , " and the walls as " tired turquoise . " Althoughit was on the outer side of the building , the Venetian blinds were usually closed , further emphasizing the room 's cheerless atmosphere . Between the windows a cluster of flags provided the sole touch of bright color . There were nine of them : the personal flag of each service chief and the standard of each of the four services , plus the chairman 's own flag  --  a blue-and-white rectangle divided diagonally with two stars in51 / MONDAYeach half and an American eagle , wearing a shield and clutchingthree gold arrows , in the center . A changing array of wall maps lent the proper military tone to the room . Today , Casey noted , a map of the United States had been hung . As Casey retired to a chair outside , the service chiefs arrived , one at a time , from their own offices . First in was General Edward Dieffenbach , the stocky paratrooperwho was Army chief of staff , wearing the black eyepatchthat made him famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the jump boots with which he liked to emphasize his continuing rating as a qualified parachutist . General Parker Hardesty , Air Force chief of staff , needed no such sartorial trademarks . His wavy brown hair and long cigar served the purpose equally effectively . Next was General William ( " Billy " ) Riley , commandant of the Marines , owner of the most innocent blue eyes and the most belligerent jaw in the military establishment . Unlike the others , who had only a nod for Casey , Riley paused and winked . " Into the tank again for the Corps , Jiggs , " he said . " Outnumberedas usual . " Scott appeared again , but only long enough to close the door . Wait a minute , General , Casey thought , you have n't got the Navy with you yet . But the meeting began and wore on , and there was no sign of Admiral Lawrence Palmer , the chief of Naval Operations . Scott must have known he was n't coming . The four chiefs met in private for twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and motioned him to a chair . Casey sat down in the " Air Force seat " just vacated by General Hardesty . Scott pressed his hands togetherand strode over to a window to raise the blind . Casey , tapping the big brown ashtray in front of Hardesty 's place , squeezed his thumb against a crumpled ball of paper . He fingered it idly as Scott sat down and lit a fresh cigar . " Jiggs , " the General said , " Colonel Murdock told me you heard about our Preakness pool . As a personal favor , I 'd ap-52 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYpreciate it if you 'd keep that to yourself . " Casey could not quite hide his surprise . " Do n't worry , sir , " he said , grinning . " All I want is the right horse . Seriously , General , I always respect your personal messages . " " I trust you 'll keep Admiral Barnswell 's reply in confidence too . " " Of course , sir . " Scott cocked an eyebrow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize when you get your star . " He smiled at Casey . " Which I hope wo n't be too long coming . " The reference to his career genuinely flustered Casey . " Actually , General , I make it a point on the Sunday duty to limit myself to official traffic . I do n't inquire about the chairman 's personal messages , but this time  --  well , sir , the young jaygee in all-service radio is something of a gossip . " " So I 've heard . Name 's Hough , is n't it ? " " Yes , sir . " Back at his desk , Casey found he still had the little wad of paper from the conference table . Ile unfolded it absently as he mused on Scott 's mention of a possible promotion for him . By the book , he was n't due for consideration for another three years . By then there m ig , ht not he so many stars to hand out , thanks to the disarmament treaty . At least that was the way a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not waste a lot of time thinking about it . Why such a flap about those I'reakness messages ? Scott seemed a little uneasy even talking , about them . Casey could n't remember the chairman 's ever being on the defensive that way before . He flattened out the little piece of paper , which turned out to be a page from one of the memo pads on the chiefs ' table . Something was written on it , in pencil , in General Har- desty 's scrawl . Casey squinted to make it out . It seemed to say : " Air lift ECOMCON 40 K-212s at Site Y by 0700 Sat . Chi , NY , LA . Utah ? " The K-212 was the newest of the military jet transports , 53 / MONDAYbig enough to handle a hundred troops in full battle dress with light support weapons . There was that queer ECOMCON thing again . Now , just what the hell is going on ? Casey asked himself . That 's Hardesty 's writing , all right . Why would anyone need a big jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little irritated as he stuffed the paper into his pants pocket . Why is a whole operation being kept secret from the director of the Joint Staff , who is supposedto know everything ? On his way to lunch a couple of hours later , Casey met Dorsey Hough in the corridor . The bored look was gone from his sallow face . Instead , he wore a triumphant grin . " Hey , Colonel , you know that transfer I was telling you about ? Someone must have heard me talking . It came through a few minutes ago and it 's good old Pearl for me . " He did a poor imitation of a hula twist and winked at Casey . " And say , by the way , Big Barnsmell turned out to be the only party poop on the chairman 's racing form . All the others came through with their IOU 's . " He swaggered off down the hall , whistling " Sweet Leilani , " without waiting for a reply . Good God , Casey thought , a man needs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around this place . What a flatheaded flannelmouth that kid is . How does a man like that get cleared for code duty ? Thank God the Japanese are n't threatening Pearl Harbor this semester . In mid-afternoon , after delivering a folder of papers to Scott 's secretary , Casey met another colonel  --  this one Army  --  as he was leaving the chairman 's office . The two men all but collided head on in the doorway . " Well , well , if it is n't my favorite jar-head himself , " said the soldier , pulling Casey into the corridor and looking him up and down appraisingly . " Hello , Broderick , " Casey replied , trying to hide his distaste for the other man 's use of an epithet that was generally intended to provoke a Marine to blows . " I thought you were in Okinawa , or maybe worse . " 54 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYA heavy hand came down just a bit too hard on Casey 's shoulder . " Not me , Jerome , not me . " Instantly the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel John R. Broderick was as ugly a man as he knew . His eyebrows merged in a dark line over the bridge of his nose , a scar marked his right cheek , the backs of his hands were covered with thick black hair . Casey had seen Broderick'sface contorted with contempt and had long ago decided this was the most arrogant officer he 'd ever met . They had fallen out the first time they had seen each other , in the officers ' club at the Norfolk Naval Base during joint amphibious exercises years ago when Casey was in the basic officers ' course at Quantico and Broderick was a new second john in the Army . They were standing at the long mahogany bar when Broderick made some sneering remark about the Marines . Casey suggested he had n't meant it and when Broderickrepeated his gibe , Casey invited him outside . Instead , Broderick swung at him right there and ( ' asey swung back . Luckily two friends broke it up and there were no senior officers in the room . Their paths crossed occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Casey remembered Broderick , by then a Signal Corps battalion commander , growling that the country would never be worth a danm until we got a President " with enough iron in his spine to shut down the goddam Congress for a couple of years . " Ironically , their wives met and become friendly while they were overseas , and Casey later suffered through a couple of strained social evenings while Broderick inveighed against the President , both parties , and politicians in general . A few months ago the Brodericks disappeared from Washington and Casey had n't bothered to find out their whereabouts . Somewhere along the line Broderick had learned that he could always rile Casey by using his middle name . " Jerome , my boy , " he said now , " I hear you 're doing a fine job as director of the Joint Staff , a fine job . " Casey felt like swinging again . Not the least of Broderick's55 / MONDAYpoisonous traits was his habit of saying everything twice , as though his listener were either deaf or a moron , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Uh . . . oh , no you do n't , no you do n't . I 'm top secret , pal , all the way . Just in town for the day to report to the chairman . " He nodded toward Scott 's office and smiled condescendinglyat Casey . " Have it your own way , Broderick , " Casey said . " You usually manage to , anyway . " " How right , Jerome , how right . See you around sometime . " Casey was back at his desk a few minutes later , still irritated , when Marge called . She had just finished a round of golf at the Army-Navy Country Club and was about to pick up the boys at school . " Jiggs , " she asked , " who do you think I just saw in the clubhouse ? " " Abercrombie and Fitch . " " Monday 's your bad day for jokes , honey . I saw Helen Broderick . Very mysterious , like Mata Hari . Would n't say what John 's doing . Something very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the hush-hush things , dear ? " " Oh , sure , " Casey said . At least I used to , he thought . " Well , I 'm dying to know . Sounds all hot and sandy and deliciously secret . What time will you be home tonight ? " " The usual , more or less , I guess . Say about six . " Casey toyed with a pencil on his desk . So Broderick is head of some secret command near Fort Bliss , eh ? That checked with what Mutt Henderson was talking about yesterday . On a hunch , he fished out of his jacket pocket the paper Mutt had given him and dialed the number . Henderson answered . " Hi , Mutt . Jiggs . Just checking on you . When you leaving ? " " In a couple of hours , after the C.O. gets through with Scott . " Casey kept his tone casual . " Hope you get along better with Johnny Broderick than I do , " he said . " The guy rubs me the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he takes a lot of getting used to. 56 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYBut he 's one hell of a C.O. , Jiggs . Our outfit really moves . The men do n't like him , but they work their butts off for him anyway . Big morale man . " " Well , good luck , Mutt . Let us know next time you come up here . " My God , Casey thought as he hung up , Scott sure picked a fine Fascist son-of-a-bitch to run his ECOMCON  --  whatever that is . Casey pulled the stack of papers out of his " in " box and doggedly set to work on them . He could n't keep his mind on the job . The events of the past two days kept intruding on his concentration . Finally he gave up trying and just sat , wondering why he was so addled . Suddenly he got up , cleared his desk , locked his safe , and picked up his cap . " Miss Hart , " he said to his secretary , " call the car for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's any flak , I 'll be there . " His car was in the driveway when the Army chauffeur delivered Casey at his home . The boys were nowhere in evidence . He found Marge in the kitchen . " It 's only four o'clock , Jiggs , " she said , startled . " Are you sick ? " He answered with an embrace whose vigor and duration were sufficient to convince her of his good health . He grinned at her when she wiggled loose . " Nope , I 'm doing fine , " he said , " but I need to take the car for an errand . I wo n't he long . " He changed into slacks and sport shirt , then drove down to the Potomac and out the George Washington Parkway , past the fashionable homes on the bluffs , all the way to Great Falls . He parked and walked down along the dirt path to a rock ledge overlooking the cascades . Casey sat on the rocks and watched the brown water of the Potomac careen over the falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting into new rapids . He watched this , but he did not really see it , for he was thinking . Prentice talking about being " alert . " Admiral Barnswell refusing to put up ten bucks for the chairman 's betting pool . That bastard Broderick . ECOMCON . General Hardesty's57 / MONDAYcrumpled memo : a big airlift to New York , Chicago , Los Angeles and . . . and maybe Utah . Why Utah ? In fact , why an airlift ? What was Site Y anyway ? And why was Scott suddenly cutting him out of things ? Bits and pieces from the past two days swirled in Casey 's mind like the water at the foot of the falls . He struggled to sort them out . The Vice-President 's trip , for some reason , kept intruding on his thoughts , but he was at a loss to know why . Casey again felt the uneasiness of Sunday morning and the anxiety that had kept him awake last night . He sat by the falls and stared down at them , and he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost an hour , oblivious of the strolling couples and the racketing children who passed him . Then he stood up , stretched , and walked slowly back along the path , his eyes on the ground . He was still preoccupied as he drove along the river toward town . In Langley the sight of a telephone booth at the corner of a service station lot broke the spell . Casey pulled off the road , dropped a dime into the coin box , and dialed . " White House . " The operator was simply stating a fact . Casey took a deep breath , started to speak , then hesitated . " White House ? " The phrase had become a question . " Paul Girard , please , " said Casey , finding his voice . " May I tell him who is calling ? " " Colonel Martin Casey . " " Just a minute , Colonel . " There was a delay of more than a minute before Girard came on . " Jiggs , if you offer to buy me a drink , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisecrack . " Paul , " he said , " I want to see the President . " " Oh , fine , " Girard scoffed . " What did you do when you got home last night ? Pick up where I left off ? You really must be flying by now . " " Paul , " Casey repeated , " I want to see the President . No kidding . " " Sure . All you have to do is invent a forty-hour day and we58 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYcan take care of you and everybody else too . " " Paul , I 'm serious . I 've got to see him . " Girard chuckled patronizingly . " Okay , pal . How about my saving you a few minutes the next time your boss comes over here ? I 'll slip you in afterwards if you can hang around . " " Uh-uh . I have to see him right away . Today . " For the first time there was the slightest hint of professional wariness in Girard 's voice when he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this all about ? Some hot-shot Pentagon business ? " " Paul , I ca n't talk to you about it now . " " You can tell your uncle Paul , J iggs . These phone lines are okay . " " No , no , I do n't mean that . " Casey was sweating inside the stuffy phone booth , but the heat was not the cause . " I ca n't tell you about it , Paul . It 's . . . it 's a national security matter . " Casey knew there was much defense information to which he had access but which was denied to Girard on the theory that he did n't need to know it . He hoped the phrase would be enough . It was n't . " Jesus , Jiggs , are n't you pretty far out of channels ? How about doing it through Scott or the Secretary of Defense ? " " I ca n't , Paul . " Girard again chose to see the funny side . " Ah , I 'm beginning to get it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion ? Or are you after the chairman 's job ? " Casey squeezed the phone hard . " Paul , listen to me . Please . You know I 'd tell you about this if I could . I 'd like to . I think the ) ' resident would , and will , but he 's got to decide that . ' ) ' here are things involved that I 'm sure you do n't know about and it is n't up to me to tell them to you . " He stopped . " Go ahead , J iggs . " There was no jesting in Girard 's voice now and Casey knew he had broken through . " I said it was a national security matter . What I really mean is , it involves the . . . the security of the government . The President has to know about it as soon as possible . " 59 / MONDAYGirard was silent for what seemed to Casey like half an hour . Then he spoke again , all business . " Well , how about tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 'll be twelve hours wasted , " Casey said . " Besides , I can only come at night . " " Oh . " There was another pause . Then : " Hang on , Jiggs . Let me talk to The Man and see what I can do . " Casey loosened his shirt , pushed the door of the booth open a foot or so , and lit a cigarette . It was half gone when Girard 's voice came through the phone again . " Okay , Jiggs . Be here at eight-thirty sharp tonight . Conte in the east entrance . I 'll be waiting for you . And I sure hope it 's as important as you said , because the President hates any nighttime stuff . " " Thanks , Paul , " said Casey . " It 's important . And Paul , tell the President all you know about me . He 's got to hear me out . " Monday NightCasey left his car in a garage on F Street and walked around the block past the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city like a veil , blurring the sharp edges of daytime . The statue of Albert Gallatin in front of the Treasury seemed friendly , almost lifelike , in the dusk . There were few people on Pennsylvania Avenue , for Washington , unlike Paris or London , withdraws into itself after sunset . It is a habit that Europeans patronize but which Americans feel lends a kind of lonely dignity to their capital . Casey was simply thankful for the lack of pedestrians on the streets ; he did not care to be seen just then . He had viewed the scene scores of times : the great elms arching over the sidewalk from the White I louse lawn , the last white-capped guide still prowling the corner in quest of a late tourist , the handful of bench sitters dozing in Lafayette Park , the glow from the great hanging lantern on the White House portico . Tonight the calm setting seemed somehow unreal , strangely detached from his own mission . Casey turned the corner down East Executive Avenue and walked quickly to the east gate , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubicle . In the semicircular driveway beyond , Girard was waiting , his eyelids half lowered like tiny curtains in the big head , his hands jammed in his pants pockets . " Here 's my man , officer , " he said . " He 's okay . " Girard made no effort to suppress his curiosity as they walked along the wide ground-floor hallway through the east wing to the mansion itself . " What the devil is this all about , Jiggs ? " " Paul , I told you I ca n't tell you about it . That 's got to be up to the President . Did you brief him on me ? " " Sure . " Girard paused before he pressed the elevator button . " Listen , Jiggs , I hope this is n't more trouble . The Man 's got all the headaches he can stand right now . " The elevator doors slid open and they stepped into the little car . With walnut paneling , rich brown carpeting , and two oval windows in the doors , it seemed almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second floor and led him across the cavernous hall  --  actually a great room in itself  --  that swept almost the whole width of the mansion . The President 's study was oval in shape . Casey guessed that it must be directly above the ornate Blue Room on the first floor . Here , in the living quarters , the colors were warmer , thanks to soft yellow carpeting and slip covers , but the study was still far too large for Casey 's taste or comfort . Its high ceiling , pilastered walls , tall bookcases , and shoulder-high marble mantel combined to make him feel a little less than life-size . President Lyman was reading , his big feet all but hiding the footstool on which they rested , when Casey and Girard entered . An Irish setter with silky red-brown hair and sad eyes lay curled on a little hooked rug beside the President 's chair . Lyman laid his glasses on a table , stood up quickly and came forward smiling , his large hand extended . The dog accompaniedhim and sniffed gravely at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a pleasure to see you outside of businesshours. " 62 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " If this is n't business , " Girard said , " I 'll strangle him . " He returned to the door . " I 'll leave you two alone . " " Colonel , " said Lyman as the door closed , " meet Trimmer . He 's a political dog . He has absolutely no convictions , but he 's loyal to his friends . " " I 've read about him , sir , " said Casey . " Good evening , Trimmer . " " Ever been up here before , Colonel ? " " No , sir . Just social occasions downstairs . Awful big rooms , sir . " Lyman laughed . " Too big for living and too small for conventions . I do n't blame Harry Truman and the others for gettingout of here every time they had the chance . Sometimes it gives me the creeps . " Lyman swept his arm around the room , his bony wrist thrusting out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to hold a hall in , this room is about as cozy as you could expect . They tell me it used to be pretty stiff until Mrs. Kennedy did it over in this yellow . And she found that old footstool somewhere . The Fraziers left it that way and Doris and I decided we could n't improve on it either . " Casey was vastly ill at case . he was no stranger to high officials , including this President , but somehow even Lyman 's small talk , though obviously intended to relax him , made the nature of his errand suddenly seem to dwindle in dimension . What had been real and immediate in the roar of Great Falls now looked fuzzy and a hit improbable . He stood somewhat stiffly . " Drink , Colonel ? " " Why . . . yes , sir . Scotch , please , sir . A little on the pale side , if you do n't mind . " " Fine . I 'll keep you company . " The drinks mixed , the two men sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trimmersettled down again on his rug , his eyes on Casey . Over the white marble mantel , the prim features of Healy 's Euphemia Van Rensselaer looked down on them , not altogether approvingly . Casey was facing the tall triple windows which pro-63 / MONDAY NIGHTvided , through sheer mesh curtains , a vista of the darkening Ellipse . The fountain on the south lawn raised its stream of water below the balcony . Far away , down by the tidal basin , stood the domed colonnade of the Jefferson Memorial , its centralstatue softly spotlighted . A little to the left , and much closer , rose the gray-white shaft of the Washington Monument , red lights at its top as a warning to low-flying aircraft . " And now , Colonel . That matter of national security . " Lyman 's eyes were on Casey . Casey licked his lips , hesitated a moment and then began just as he had rehearsed it on the drive from home . " Mr. President , " he asked , " have you ever heard of a militaryunit known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I have . What does it mean ? " " I 'm not sure , sir , but in normal military abbreviations , I 'd think it would stand for something like Emergency CommunicationsControl . ' " " Never heard of anything like that , " the President said . Casey took his second step . " I know a colonel is n't supposed to question his commander in chief , sir , but have you ever authorized the formation of any type of secret unit , regardless of its name , that has something to do with preserving the security of things like telephones , or television and radio ? " Lyman leaned forward , puzzled . " No , I have n't . " " Excuse me again , sir , but one more question . Do you know of the existence of a secret army installation that has been set up somewhere near El Paso recently ? " " The answer is no ' again , Colonel . Why ? " " Well , sir , I had n't heard of it either , until yesterday . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared and I 'm supposedto know everything that goes on in the military establishment . That 's even more true of you , sir , as commander in chief . " Lyman sipped his drink for the first time . Casey reached gratefully for his own highball and took a swallow before he went on . " In a way I 'm relieved that you said no ' to those questions , 64 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYMr . President , but in a way I 'm not . I mean , if you had said you knew all about ECOMCON , I 'd have said thanks and apologized for bothering you and asked permission to go home . I 'd have been pretty embarrassed . But the way it is , Mr. President , it 's worse . I 'm frightened , sir . " " We do n't scare easy in this house , Colonel . Suppose you let me have the whole story . " " Well , sir , yesterday I learned from an old Army friend , a Colonel Henderson , that he 's executive officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another man I know , an Army colonel named John Broderick . Both of them are Signal Corps , which means their outfit has something to do with communications . They 've had a hundred officers and thirty-five hundred men training secretly at a desert base near El Paso for six weeks or so . " I ran into Henderson by accident and naturally he thought I knew all about it , because of my job . He said one odd thing that got me thinking , something about how they spent more time in training on the seizing than on the preventing . ' He complained that somebody up here must have a defeatist attitudebecause their book seemed to assume that the Communistsalready had the facilities . " " What facilities ? " Lyman broke in . " He did n't say . " " Who set up this outfit ? " " I assume General Scott did , sir . At least Henderson and Broderick were up here to report directly to the chairman today . " Of course , " Casey went on , " when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it for some perfectly logical security reason . It did n't occur to me then that you might not know about it . It just seemed odd . Then this morning I got another jolt . Look at this , sir . " Casey took the memo-sized paper from his wallet , unfoldedit carefully , and handed it to the President . Lyman reached for his glasses . He studied the note for a minute . " I must say I ca n't make much out of this scrawl , Colonel . " 65 / MONDAY NIGHT " That 's General Hardesty 's writing , sir . I know it pretty well . The paper comes from one of the memo pads they use in the Joint Chiefs ' meeting room . It was rolled up in a ball in an ashtray and I happened to pick it up this morning . " " What does it say ? I ca n't make sense out of the part of it I can read , let alone the rest . " Lyman held out the note . Casey took it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECOMCON. 40 K-212s at Site Y by 0700 Sat . Chi , NY , LA . Utah ? ' " It looks to me , sir , like Air Force jet transports  --  that 's the K-212  --  are scheduled to lift this whole command out of Site Y  --  that 's what Henderson called the base near El Paso  --  before the alert Saturday , and take the troops to Chicago , New York , Los Angeles , and maybe Utah . The telephone company has big relay facilities for its long lines , you know , sir , in Utah . " Lyman eyed Casey closely . Casey , in his turn , noted a frown on the President 's face . He wondered whether it was a sign of concentration  --  or of suspicion . " Just what are you leading up to , Colonel ? " " I 'm not sure , as I said , Mr. President . But let me try to tell you the other things that have happened in the past two days . It 's all very hard for me to sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . Slowly , carefully , and in detail , Casey recountedevery oddity that had occurred since Sunday morning . He began with Scott 's invitation to the five field commandersfor wagers on the Preakness , Admiral Barnswell 's curt " no bet " reply , and the unusual emphasis that Scott had put on the need for silence on Casey 's part . He told of meetingSenator Prentice at the Dillard party , of Prentice 's outspokencondemnation of Lyman and praise of Scott , and of his use of a phrase that indicated knowledge of the alert . He explainedhow he had seen Prentice 's car parked outside Scott 's quarters at midnight , and how Scott had lied to him about that visit by saying he had been asleep by 10:30 . He told of Scott 's apparently lying again when he said no one on Capitol66 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYHill knew of plans for the alert . He mentioned Dorsey Hough 's sudden transfer . He quoted Broderick 's previously stated views on the desirability of a government without a Congress , and cited his bitter disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiefs had set the alert for a time when Congress would be in recess , when the Vice-President would be abroad  --  and when the President would he in the undergroundcommand post at Mount Thunder . He told of his surprisewhen he noted in the paper that Gianclli would be in a remote mountain hamlet in Italy Saturday night . By the time he had finished , the White I-louse was in the full embrace of night . Only the street lights and the glint of water in the fountain could be seen through the windows . Casey glanced at his watch . He had talked for almost an hour withoutinterruption . President Lyman stretched and ran a big hand through his wiry hair . He walked over to a small table , selected a pipe , and went through the fussy little preparations for smoking it . Casey , uneasy again in the silence that followed his long recital , drank off the last ice water in the bottom of his glass . " Colonel , " said the President at last . " Let me ask you a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott ? " " Just about a year , sir . " Lyman struck a match and pulled at the pipe until he had it going . " Have you mentioned what you 've just told me to anyone else ? " " No , sir . Paul asked about it , but I thought you were the only one I should talk to , under the circumstances . I have n't said a thing to anyone else . " Lyman , hack in his chair , crossed his feet on the stool and tried several smoke rings . There was a little too much draft from the open windows . " What is Scott 's real attitude on the treaty ? " the President asked . " I know he 's been against it in his testimony on the Hill , and I gather he 's leaked some stories to the newspapers . But67 / MONDAY NIGHThow deeply does he feel ? " " He thinks it 's a terrible mistake , sir , a tragic one . He believesthe Russians will cheat and make us look silly , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise attack some night , at worst . " " And you , Colonel , how do you feel ? " Casey shook his head . " I ca n't make up my mind , Mr. President . Some days I think it 's the only way out for both sides . Other days I think we 're being played for suckers . I guess I really think it 's your business , yours and the Senate 's . You did it , and they agreed , so I do n't see how we in the militarycan question it . I mean , we can question it , but we ca n't fight it . Well , we should n't , anyway . " Lyman smiled . " Diggs , is n't it ? " he asked . " Is n't that what they call you ? " " Yes , sir , it is . " Casey began to feel almost normal . " So you stand by the Constitution , Jiggs ? " " Well , I never thought about it just that way , Mr. President . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worked pretty well so far . I sure would n't want to be the one to say we ought to change it . " " Neither would I , " Lyman said , " and I 've thought about it a lot . Especially lately , after this row over the treaty . How do the other chiefs feel about the treaty , Jiggs ? " " Just like General Scott , sir . They 're all against it . The C.N.O. , Admiral Palmer , sometimes even gets a little violent on the subject . " No sooner had he finished the sentence than Casey felt a rush of guilt . Criticizing a ranking officer inside the service was one thing , but outside quite another . " I did n't mean to single out the Admiral , sir . They all feel that way . It 's just that he  --  " Lyman cut him off . " Forget it , Colonel . By the way , at that meeting this morning  --  the one where you think that note was written  --  were all of them there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , Admiral Palmer was n't in it . " Now Casey was thoroughly confused . " Anything unusual about that ? " 68 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " No . . . Yes , sort of . Now that I think of it , he did n't have a representative there either . I mean , it 's not unusual for a chief to miss a meeting , but they always send someone to sit in for them . In fact , I ca n't remember another time when a servicejust was n't there at all . " Lyman thought for a minute , then apparently dismissed this line . " By the way , Colonel , who are Scott 's special friends in the press and television ? Do you know ? " The question startled Casey . He glanced at the President 's face for a clue , but Lyman was studying the bowl of his pipe . " Well , sir , " Casey said hesitantly , " I 'm not really sure . He knows some of the big columnists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of Washington bureau chiefs , but I do n't know of any of them being a special friend . The editor of Life has been in a couple of times , and of course the militarywriters for the Baltimore Sun and the Star here . " I ca n't think of any others . . . Wait a minute . He 's very close to that television commentator , I larold MacPherson . I think he 's with RBC . MacPherson has called several times when I 've been in the General 's office , and I know they 've seen each other socially . Frequently , I 'd say . " " And that horse pool business ? " The President seemed to be going over the things Casey had told him . " I do n't quite get your point on that . " " I would n't have thought anything , " Casey said , " except along with everything else . Frankly , sir , I think that message could he a code for some kind of . . . well , action , on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , if that 's right , Admiral liarnswell has included himself out . " - , Again there was silence . " Well , to sum it up , Jiggs , what are you suggesting ? " " I do n't know for sure , sir . " Casey fumbled for the right words . " Just some possibilities , I guess . What we call capabilitiesin military intelligence , if you know what I mean . I guess it all sounds fantastic , just saying it , but I thought it was my duty to lay it all out for you . " 69 / MONDAY NIGHTThe President 's voice was suddenly hard . " You afraid to speak plain English , Colonel ? " " No , sir . It 's just that  --  " Lyman interrupted harshly . " Do you mean you think there may be a military plot to take over the government ? " The words hit Casey like a blow . He had avoided the idea , even in his own thoughts . Now it was there , an ugly presence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said wanly , " as long as you use the word may , ' making it a possibility only , I mean . " " Are you aware that you could be broken right out of the service , " Lyman snapped , " for what you have said and done tonight ? " It was Casey 's turn to stiffen . The cords stood out in his short , thick neck . " Yes , sir , I am . But I thought it all out pretty carefully this afternoon and I came here and said it . " He added quietly : " I thought about the consequences , Mr. President . I 've been a Marine for twenty-two years . " Lyman 's sudden harshness seemed to slip away . He went over to the little bar , mixed himself another Scotch and asked Casey if he would n't like a second . Casey nodded . God knows I need one , he thought . " You know , " Lyman said , " I can never get over the caliber of the service academy graduates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nation . And they 've been good for it . The country has believed that  --  look at the rewardsmilitary men have been given , even this office I happen to hold right now . There 's been a real feeling of trust between our military and civilians , and damned few countries can say that . I think it 's one of our great strengths . " Lyman went on , looking at the liquid in his glass , not so much talking to the other man in the room as musing aloud about the generals and admirals he had known and admired . He spoke with something like awe of the combat records of Scott , Riley and Dieffenbach . He said he agreed with the70 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYpeople who thought Scott might be the next President . Casey listened respectfully , sipping his drink . He had n't realized the President felt this way . He seemed to know everythingabout the military . He was generous in his evaluation of men . When Lyman told an anecdote about General Riley , a story of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he also was becoming aware that this man was far more perceptive and sensitive than he had realized . " Maybe that 's why our system works so well , " Lyman concluded , " fitting men with the brains and courage of Scott and Riley in near the top , making use of their talents , but still under civilian control . I 'd hate to see that balance upset in some hasty action by men who 'd come to regret it until the day they died . " " So would I , sir , " Casey said . " Have you any bright ideas on what I ought to do , Jiggs ? " " No , sir . " Casey felt inadequate , almost as if he 'd let this man down . " I 'm just a buck passer on this one , Mr. President . The solution is way out of my league . " The President unhitched his big feet from in front of him and stood up in an angular series of motions that seemed to proceed one joint at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no perceptible pull , but Casey found himself moving toward the door as he returned the handshake . " Colonel , " Lyman said , " I very much appreciate your coming in to see me . I think perhaps I ought to know where I can reach you at any time . Could you call Miss Townsend , my secretary , in the morning and keep her up to date on where you 'll be ? I 'll tell her to expect the call . Thanks for coming in . Thanks very much . " " Yes , sir . Good night , sir . " Casey was out in the big hall . Lyman came after him as he started for the elevator . " One other thing , Colonel . Now that you 've talked to me there are two of us who know about your thoughts . I think maybe I 'd better be the one to decide from now on whether anyone else should know . That includes your wife , too . " " I never tell her anything that 's classified , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified by the Commanderin Chief , " Lyman said with a quick smile . " Good night , Jiggs . " When Girard came back to the President 's study after meeting Casey on the ground floor and escorting him out , he found Lyman walking restlessly around the room . " Get a drink in your fist , Paul , " the President said . " You 'll want one . Your friend Casey thinks he 's discovered a military plot to throw us out and take over the government . " " He what ? " Girard gaped in disbelief . " That 's what the man says . A regular damn South Americanjunta . " " Oh , Christ . " Girard groaned in mock horror . " Not this month . We 're booked solid with troubles already . " Lyman ignored the opening for light repartee . He spoke slowly . " Paul , I 'm going to tell you everything he told me . First , there 's one thing you need to know . Another All Red alert , a full readiness test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. I 'm supposed to go up to Mount Thunder for it . Under the security plan , you were n't to know , and neither was anyone else except the chiefs , Casey and Colonel Murdock , Scott 's aide . Now remember that and listen to me . " Lyman recounted Casey 's full story . He showed Girard the creased scratch-pad sheet with General Hardesty 's scribbles , and copies of Scott 's message and Barnswell 's reply , all of which Casey had left with him . As Lyman talked , Girard sank lower in his chair , his sleepy eyes almost closed , his head cradled between his hands . " Now let me add a few things I know that I did n't tell Casey about , " Lyman said when he had finished . " Several months ago I got a call from General Barney Rutkowski , the chief of the Air Defense Command . I 've known Barney awhile and I guess he thought he could speak freely to me . Anyway , he said General Daniel , the SAC commander , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with Scott about thepolitical mess the country 's in and the military 's responsibility , ' or something like that . Barney asked me what to do . I told him that I could use a little advice from Scott , but the upshot was that Barney stalled off the invitation and nothing came of it . At least , I never heard any more about it . " Girard pulled his ear . " I gather your point is that Daniel is one of the men on Scott 's betting list . " " That , and the wording of the invitation Barney got , " Lyman said . " Now , second . Vince Gianelli told me at lunch today that Prentice was the one who suggested he spend Fri- day and Saturday nights at his grandfather 's place in the mountains . Fred suggested it to him last Friday , Vince says , and he changed his plans to do it . Of course , it 's a good pub- licity gimmick , but it 's funny that Prentice would be thinking up ways to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed the date for the alert , which Prentice obviously knows about , if we can believe what Casey says . " " Do n't worry about that part of it , boss , " Girard said . " Jiggs is solid . He never makes anything up , and he 's got a good memory to boot . " " A third point , " Lyman went on . " A week ago Sunday , I watched the Harold MacPherson show on RBC . He spent twenty-five minutes blasting me and the treaty and five min- utes praising the hejesus out of Scott . I had n't seen him in quite a while . Actually I watched because Doris had been raving about his sex appeal and it made me curious . The fel- low 's a spellbinder all right . His style reminds me of Bishop Sheen or Billy ( rahvu years ago . Afterwards I realized I did n't know much about him and I asked Art Corwin to run me a quiet check . " " You could have told me , " complained Girard . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , normally did the confidential political chores . " I meant to , Paul , but I just forgot , frankly . Well , to my surprise , Corwin came back with word that the FBI has quite72 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY73 / MONDAY NIGHTa file on MacPherson . It seems he belongs to several of those far-right-wing groups . A couple of them have a lot of retired military men in their memberships . You know the kind of thing they advocate . " Girard grunted . " Yeah , stamp out everything . Some of these military guys seem to hate what they call socialism ' more every time they get another free ride out of it , from the academies on . If you took them seriously , we 'd have to indictourselves for treason  --  and them with us . " " That 's about it . Anyway , Casey says Scott and MacPhersonare close friends . That kind of surprised me , but if it 's right , then Scott may be playing around with the lunatic fringe . " Now , fourth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants me to shake off the press at Camp David and take a chopper down to Mount Thunder . I said I 'd like to take a newspaper pool man to play square with the boys , but Scott insisted that this alert had to be worked just like the real thing . So I gave in . But you can see what that means . I 'll be going to the cave Saturday with only Corwin and one or two other agents , at the most . " " The way you make it sound , " Girard commented dryly , " you better take along a couple of divisions of Secret Service men , to say nothing of the Alcohol Tax Unit , the FBI , and anybody else who can fire a gun . " " I take it from that crack that you do n't believe Casey 's story ? " Lyman asked . " I do n't say he is n't telling the truth , boss . I 'm sure he is . I just do n't agree with the conclusion . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd . " " Yes , it is , " Lyman said , " but the string of coincidences is getting pretty long . " " The thing that seems unlikeliest to me , " Girard said slowly , " is the e-co-hop business , or whatever Casey calls it . How in the devil could Scott set up a big outfit like that , with all the people and supplies involved , without your hearing74 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYabout it ? It may only have been operating six weeks , but they must have started construction right after you signed the treaty last fall . " " On the other hand , " Lyman said , " it ought to be easy enough to check . " Girard got up and went over to the phone beside the curved sofa by the windows . " Sure it is . How about giving Bill Fullerton a call ? He 's a career man with no ax to grind . And he knows where every dime in the Pentagon is spent . " " Go ahead , " Lyman said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unit e-com-con . ' " Girard reached Fullerton , head of the military division of the Bureau of the Budget , at his home . " Bill , " he said , " keep this one confidential , because it 's from The Man . Have you people ever cleared any money for something called ECOMCON ? It 's supposed to he an Army outfit with about thirty-five hundred men . That 's right . .. . You have n't , huh ? " Lyman scribbled a note and held it up for Girard : " Any unallocated JCS funds ? " Girard was still talking to Fullerton . " You ever hear of this ECOMCON yourself , Bill ? " Girard put his hand over the mouthpiece and spoke to the President . " Never heard of it , he says . " lie spoke to Fullerton again . " One other thing , 13111 . Do the Joint Chiefs have any unallocatedmoney ? . . . Oh , yeah . No other way , though ? .. . Well , listen , Bill , thanks . Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it under your hat , okay ? Right . See you . " Girard hung up and turned to Lyman . " He never heard of it . Ile says he 'd have to , because every new project has to be justified before him first , no matter how highly classified it is . The Joint Chiefs have a hundred millionfor emergencies , but they 're supposed to get your approvalin writing and so far as he knows the money has n't been tapped . Hell , if there are thirty-five hundred men down at that base , that 's somewhere around twenty million bucks a year just to feed , pay , and put clothes on ' em . " 75 / MONDAY NIGHTGirard mixed himself a second drink . Lyman tapped the bottom of his own glass , long since emptied of the Scotch he 'd shared with Casey , on the heel of his hand , but shook his head when Girard offered him the bottle . The two men sat again for several minutes , not speaking . " My sister 's little kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't bring myself to think seriously about it . " " That thought has been going through my head too , Paul , but I think I had better proceed on the assumption it might be true . " " Sure . " Girard nodded in agreement . " This could add up to something bad . Something very bad , " Lyman said , measuring the words out . " Yes , it could , boss . " " I 'm glad you agree . Then I do n't have to spell it out for you . " Lyman walked to the triple window that looked out on the south lawn , swung open the door cut into the right-hand sash , and stepped onto the balcony . The night air felt wonderfully fresh . He stood there looking at the huge obelisk that honoredWashington , a good general who 'd made a good Presidenttoo . Out of sight beyond the magnolia tree to his right , he knew , was the memorial to Lincoln , a good President who 'd had his troubles  --  God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight , away up the Mall to the left , was the statue of Grant , that very good general who had made a very bad President . Lyman turned back into the study where Girard waited and went on as if he had not interrupted himself : " And I think it 's just as well , Paul , not to try to spell it out . We might find we were spelling it out all wrong , and that could be very embarrassing . " " Okay , " said Girard , " let 's play it that way . So what do we do now ? " " If Casey 's story means what he thinks it does , we 've got only four full days left before Saturday . It 's too late to do anythingtonight . We 've got to start in the morning . Then , if it76 j/ SEVEN DAYS IN MAYdoes check out and we can stop it ... then what ? " " That 's easy , " Girard said . " You fire the whole crew and haul ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " No , " he said , " I do n't think so . Not in this administration , Paul . Not now and not later either . A trial like that would tear this country apart . Well , think about it . Let 's break it up now and I 'll see you first thing in the morning . " " Good night , Mr. President , " Girard said . " Do n't lose your sleep over this thing . There may be some ridiculous explanationthat 'll give us all a good laugh . " Lyman shrugged . " Maybe . Good night , Paul . " Now the President was alone , except for Trimmer . He tugged at his tie , walked back and forth , then stepped out onto the balcony again . Truman 's balcony . Everything in this house was a reminder of the past . One of Jack Kennedy 's rocking chairs , its cane seat and wooden back covered with yellow canvas , stood in the corner of this study . The desk , its veneered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been Monroe 's . By the door into the bedroomwere two flags , the President 's personal standard and the national colors . The latter had stood there unchanged since the day Hawaii was admitted as the fiftieth state in Eisenhower'stime . What a lonely house , l.yinan thought . Too big , too empty , no place in it where a man can wall himself off and think his own thoughts undisturbed by the least . What 's more , it is n't mine . From the balcony tie could see the intermittent sweep of headlights as motorists curved past the high iron fence at the foot of the White ( louse lawn . As always , they slowed when they came in line with the house , hoping even in the night to catch a glimpse of the inmates . Fantastic . That was the only word for the colonel 's story . Lyman wondered whether the man was sound mentally , despiteGirard 's assurances . Still , his reactions were normal and average . The way he had been tongue-tied when he came in , 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was just like every other first-time visitor . Maybe a little too much like every other visitor , in fact . Could it possibly be some kind of double play by Scott , to trap him and make him appear a fool before the country , to discredit the treaty ? No , that was even more farfetched . The only prudent course was to check this thing out as quickly and quietly as possible and be done with it . Perhaps , as Girard said , there was some ludicrously simple explanation . Maybe it was a once-in-a-million string of coincidences with no connection whatever . After all , do n't they say that if six monkeys hit typewriters long enough , they 'd write the EncyclopediaBritannica ? Lyman went back to his armchair and his pipe . It was time to get this thing down to a manageable level . The first thing to do was what Girard said  --  find out about this ECOMCON business . For that , he 'd need someone he could trust . Better start picking the team . Mentally he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd appointed in the sixteen months since his inauguration . Lyman had n't gone far before he realized what he was doing : he was discarding name after name of men he had picked to do important jobs , but who could n't be counted on for this one because they were n't tough enough , or trustworthy enough , or close enough to him  --  or because they might talk about it if it turned out to be a mirage . Because they might talk . It was n't that he feared being laughed at . The point was that he would n't want even a whisper to get out that he had so much as dreamed it could happen . That would be bad for the country . And bad for Jordan Lyman too , he thought . Now , is n't that a damn-fool way to decide who can be counted on to help preserve the security of the country ? Still , face it , Lyman , you 're human and that 's part of it . All right , then , who wo n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stay in all the way and do some good if it 's not ? He thought at once that both Girard and Ray Clark would78 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYchuckle at his self-analysis and confession . Have to tell them . tomorrow . Well , that settled that . There could be no effective defense of his position without Girard and Clark . Who else ? Casey , of course . The colonel might not be the most brilliant officer he 'd ever met , but his instincts seemed sound . Let 's hope his facts are too . Or hope , dammit , that they are n't . At any rate , Casey was already in this thing up to his eyes . The Cabinet ? Lyman ran swiftly through the list . The Sec- retary of State would be pedantic , tiresome , and of absolutely no value . The Secretary of Defense talked too much , about everything . Good God , the man was never quiet . Even when he had good ideas , nobody could listen long enough to catch them . Lyman liked Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welfare . In such a power struggle as this one might be , his advice would be good . And he had guts . But the big Negro could n't slip in and out of the White house without a dozen people noticing it and it hundred questions being asked . His skin makes him risky . Forget it . Lyman tossed aside one name after another , half wonder- ing whether the process reflected on the men involved or on him for having picked them . Ile knew he was saving Todd for the last : Christopher Todd , the flinty , cultivated Secretary of the Treasury , the best mind in the government . Furthermore , he had proved he could keep his mouth shut on the President 's business . And another big plus Chris loved a conspiracy . Give him a cloak and he 'd invent his own dagger . He also had the Yankee lawyer 's ability to sp(x)n through a mass of mush like this and pull out the hard facts . Chris had to be in . When he ran through the White llouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane names fell away like dry leaves in autumn . These were the men %ho had fought through the campaign with him , had helped set up the administration , but who among them could be relied on in this kind of funny business ? Not his press secretary , certainly . Frank Simon skimmed the surface , accurately and swiftly , but this was over . r , 79 / MONDAY NIGHThis head . He was also too exposed , too much an " outside man . " Better for both of us if he does n't know . Lyman 's specialcounsel ? Too legalistic . Law would n't help here . His chief lobbyist ? Too vain . He 'd want to carve out a juicy role for himself . But there was Art Corwin . The quiet , big-shouldered agent , " Mr. Efficiency " to his men on the White House Secret Servicedetail , would do anything for the President  --  for any President . Lyman knew without ever having inquired that Corwin'sallegiance was to the Presidency , not to the man who happened to hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move far without Corwin at his side . He had to have him . Who else , now ? The director of the FBI ? A powerful man , and thus good to have on your side in a fight . But Lyman hardly knew him ; he had spoken to him only three times , always in brisk , formal sessions . The President took down a copy of the Congressional Directoryfrom a shelf , smiling at the thought that he had to consult a compendium to remember whom he had appointed . He ran through the deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries , the members of commissions , even the courts . The names stared back at him blankly , without sympathy . He really did n't know any of these men that well . For a mission abroad or a legislative opinion , yes . In a fight for the system itself , no . And so , at last , he came back to six men : himself , Clark , Girard , Casey , Chris Todd , and Art Corwin . And Esther . Good Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone call without her knowing everything . She would be efficient , loyal , cheerful  --  and she would n't be doing it for love of an institution . At least we 're seven to the chiefs ' five , Lyman thought . We may lack a few divisions and missiles , but we 've got two centurieson our side  --  and four days . Four days ! Casey did n't come here with a dream . He brought an absolute , incredible , fantastic nightmare . It makes no sense at all. 80 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYHe walked through the door into his bedroom and stood in front of the dresser while he emptied his pants pockets . The whole world to worry about , plus one baffled Marine , plus the chairman of the Joint Chiefs . Oh , quit posing , Lyman , he told himself , and go to sleep . " Time for bed , Trimmer , " he said to the setter . " Out you go . " The dog stood patiently by the door until Lyman opened it . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nightly sleeping spot in the serving pantry just outside the kitchen . As he buttoned his pajamas , the President watched the lights going on in the parked cars around the Ellipse . Curtainmust be down at the National , he thought , noting the little knots of people coming from the direction of the theater into the bright patches under the street lights . It was the end of the daily cycle for Washington , which goes to bed earlier than any other capital in the world . The night baseball game had ended and the last stragglers scuffed across the outfield grass of the stadium toward the exits . In Arlington Cemetery , the guard changed at the Tomb of the Unknowns , the off-duty squad racking up its gleaming ceremonialrifles before turning in for the night . At the National Press Club the last strong men threw their cards down on the table , drained their glasses , and headed for home . Among them was Malcolm Waters of the Associated Press , who had allowed himself an evening of poker and VirginiaGentleman because The Man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Ilill two tired staff men left the Senate Office Building , commiserating with each other over the piles of prerecesswork that kept them at their desks so late . In a modest split-level house in Arlington Jiggs Casey rubbed his eyes , turned off the lamp , and laid down a batteredcopy of the World Almanac . It was the only book he had been able to find in the house that contained the text of the Constitution of the United States. 81 / MONDAY NIGHTIn the small booths around the White House a new shift of policemen took up the task of guaranteeing that the President would be kept safe  --  as safe as any human being could be  --  from harm to his person . They guarded the man . The office he occupied took care of itself . For almost two hundred years it had needed no guard . Tuesday MorningJordan Lyman opened one eye , then shut it again . Rain spat- tered against the windowpanes in the half-light of early morn- ing . Coming out of his sleep , Lyman listened to the comforting steadiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chill , damp mornings of his Ohio boyhood when he 'd stay snuggled in the blankets to await his father 's ritual call : " Time to get up , Jordie , the world 's waiting for you . " Here in the White ! louse the world was always waiting , but no one dared wake the President without orders  --  and Lyman had left none for this morning , l Ie stretched and scratched the back of his head . ( ; od , what a dismal day . Why had n't they ever moved the capital to Arizona ? Lyman 's months as Presi- dent had confirmed his pet theory about American diplomacy : that it lacked " initiative " primarily because of the Washington climate . The city was always wet , overcast , humidly hot or damply cold . All the bright , cool , cheerful days in a year would n't fill one month on the calendar . He was awake now , but still reluctant to abandon the com- fort of his bed . He thought of his daughter Elizabeth in Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor kid . She 's 8283 / TUESDAY MORNINGprobably in the hospital right now . Well , it will be a goodlookingboy , with Liz and her husband as the producers . Boy ? Sure , Liz will come through . Better call Doris this morning and see how things are going . Lyman was swinging himself out of bed , his feet reaching for the floor , when he remembered . That Marine colonel last night and his incredible story . Scott . MacPherson . ECOMCON . He sat for a few minutes on the edge of the bed , then picked up the phone on the night table . " Grace , " he said to the operator , " good morning . Or it was until I looked out the window . Call Esther at home , will you please , and ask her to come down as soon as she can . Tell her I 'll probably still be eating breakfast . Thanks . " Lyman washed , shaved and dressed within fifteen minutes . Leaving his bedroom , he managed a smile for the warrant officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes . What a way , Lyman thought , to make a President start a rainy day . He was in the dining room , inwardly fuming again over the grapefruit , when Esther Townsend came in . She was scrubbed and neat , her lipstick very light , the little collar of her blouse tilted upright with starch and the wisp of hair curling over one temple . Why does n't she get married ? thought the President ... The idea fled before the others crowding in behind it . " Have some coffee , Esther , " he said . " The news is as foul as the weather this morning . Somebody wants my job . " Esther eyed him over her coffee cup as she sat at the corner of the table . " Now , Governor , " she said , using the term she had favored ever since he was attorney general of Ohio and still two years away from the governorship . " Is n't this a little early to be worrying about ' 76 ? " " Somebody wants my job right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story , and his own additions , into about five minutes for her benefit . " This may be a complete misunderstanding all around , 84 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYEsther , " he said as he finished the recital , " but we 've got to find out fast . For the time being , only five people are going to know about this beyond you and me : Ray Clark , Paul Girard , Colonel Casey , Art Corwin , and Chris Todd . If any one of them calls during the rest of this week , no matter what time of day , I want you to take the message . " " Do you think I 'd better sleep here at the House ? " she asked . Her tone was neutral , and Lyman had no way of guessing her reaction to the story . Lord , he thought , I wish I knew my own . If the sun was shining now , I 'd think the whole thing was cockeyed . " Yes , I do . I think for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's office . And , Esther , what about the switchboard girls ? In a situation like this -I know it 's silly  --  but I 'd rather not trust anybody you do n't . " " That 's easy , " Esther said . " Helen ( ' hervasi and I are good friends . I 'll get her to set up the two daytime shifts so that calls from any one of those five people will be switched to her . I 'll take the overnight shift myself . " " You ca n't do that , Esther . " Lyman was genuinely concerned . " You 'd be out on your feet in two days . " She shook her head . " No , I can nap some during the day , and there wo n't be any calls much after midnight . " " Well , what do you think of it all ? " Ile was curious , for she still had made no comment on this weird new problem of the Lyman administration . She pointed her index finger at her head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They both grinned . " Actually , Governor , I 'm puzzled , just as you are . As a woman , 1 'd say I 'd have to know more about General Scott . I do n't have any particular feeling about him , I mean in that kind of thing . It ' I were you , I 'd find out more about his girl friend . " " What girl friend ? " " Oh , have n't you heard that old one ? " Esther smiled wisely and shook her head as if in pity for the backwardness of the male . " It 's been the gossip for a couple of years . The General85 / TUESDAY MORNINGis supposed to slip up to New York now and then to see a very chi-chi item named Millicent Segnier . She 's fashion editor of Cherie magazine . They 're supposed to have a big thing . " " Well , I 'll be damned , " Lyman said . " The things a man learns when he lets it drop that somebody is making a pass at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly anything to save the Republic with . Look , time 's awasting . Get Ray Clark here right away . " The morning papers lay neatly piled on the table behind the desk , still unread , when Clark sailed into Lyman 's office . " What in God 's green earth are you gettin ' me outa mah bed at this houah fo ' , Mistuh President ? " asked Clark . His face was still wet from the rain . " Ah ai n't got me one of them free ten-thousand-dolluh White House funeral wagons to carry me , neither . 01 ' Ray got ta drive hisse'f . " Lyman 's smile was no more than perfunctory . " Stow the accentthis morning , will you , Ray ? We 've got some fast thinking to do . " He buzzed for Esther and asked her to order a breakfast for Clark . " Do you know a Marine colonel named Casey , Martin Casey ? " " Sure , " Clark said . " If you mean the director of the Joint Staff . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favor once , too . The son of a pretty prominent fellow in Atlantawent AWOL from Marine boot camp down at Parris Island . The kid got what was coming to him , but Casey was nice enough to see they kept it out of the papers . " " How do you size him up , Ray ? " " Pretty straight , so far as I know . " Clark saw the look on Lyman 's face and refined his appraisal . " I 'd go a little further . You get a feeling about some people . It 's just a hunch , but I 'd say Casey was solid . Why ? Do you have to trust him on some-thing ? " " We sure as hell do , Ray . Casey came to see me upstairs last night . He thinks he has evidence that there may be a military plot to seize the government on Saturday . " 86 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYLyman had expected Clark to explode with a guffaw . Instead , the senator just raised his eyebrows and stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I 'm a little crazy ? " Lyman asked . " The first , Jordie . " " Why , for God 's sake ? " " You tell me the story first . Then I 'll tell you why . " This time , as he had with Girard the night before , President Lyman spent almost an hour in the telling , being careful to fit in his own additions , Girard 's talk with Bill Fullerton of the Budget Bureau , and even Esther 's piece of gossip about Scott . Clark finished his breakfast as Lyman talked . " Now , my questions , " Lyman said as he finished the narrating . " As the ranking member on Arnicd Services , have you ever heard of ECOMCON ? And wily were n't you surprised ? " " As to the first , " Clark said slowly , " I sure have n't . As for the second , I 'll tell you why . Goddanunit , Mr. President , I 've told you at least three times that morale in the services is lousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean even further than ever before . And the officers  --  and the regular NCO 's and enlisted men too -- -think your refusal to restore the old fringe benefits is sonic kind of personal affront on your part. , , " Ray , I promised you we 'd send up a hill to adjust military pay and benefits , but when I do I want to do it right and give it a real shove . Maybe 1 have let it slide too long , but the bill 's just about ready now . " I.vman tujged at his ear . " But you do n't really think that the - nilitary would try to seize the governmentjust because they 're underpaid , do you ? " " No , " said Clark . " Of course not . But it 's part of the climate . Jordie , this country is in a foul mood . It 's not just the treaty , or the missile strikes , or any one thing . It 's the awful frustration that just keeps building tip and up . They think every new Presidentis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commies go away . Of course , he never is . But right now it 's getting worse . I 'll bet I get five hundred letters every time that nut MacPherson goes on the idiot box . And some senators get more . " 87 / TUESDAY MORNING " But a Pentagon plot ? " Lyman 's tone was incredulous . " I 'm talking about the climate , Jordie . The move could come from anywhere . I 'll bet if that bastard Prentice had a little real guts inside that belly of his he 'd be ready to try it too . When you 're down to 29 per cent in the polls , they line up to take pot shots at you . Anything can happen . " " You did n't read the Gallup Poll that way yesterday , " Lyman said . " I did n't know General Scott had rented himself a white horse yesterday , either . " " Then you believe it ? " Lyman asked . " I 'm like you and Casey . I think we damn well better check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I could count on you , Ray , " Lyman said , his voice showing his relief . " I 'm not quite sure where I 'd turn if it were n't for you . " Clark stared at Lyman . " Mr. President , you 're the best friend I 've got and I 'd do almost anything for you , " he said , " but if you do n't mind my saying so , this might turn out to be something a lot bigger than just helping Jordan Lyman . " Lyman walked around the desk . " Scratch a true Southerner , " he said , " and you find a patriot , despite the Yankees he has to put up with . And now , since we 've let our hair down , Ray , I hope you can stay out of trouble for the rest of the week . " Clark 's eyes shifted away from the President . " I do n't make promises to other people on that subject . I make ' em to myself . " " Any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no bottle for the duration . That 's an order . " Clark was curt . " I can take care of myself , Mr. President . What do you want me to do next ? " " See if you ca n't get something out of Scott at the hearing this morning about ECOMCON , " Lyman said . " You know , from the side , easy . We ca n't let him get the least idea that we suspect anything . And be back here at two o'clock sharp . I want a meeting . Come in the east entrance . We 'll go up to the$$ / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYsolarium . I 'm going to talk to Corwin and Chris alone this morning . " Lyman was at the buzzer by the time Clark had shut the door behind him . " Esther , get Art Corwin in here right away . And listen , Esther , tell Paul to go see Fullerton and get a rundownon all the classified military installations in the country . Overseas , too , while he 's at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anybody about last night 's call  --  or today'seither . One other thing : I want Chris Todd here at eleven . Okay ? " Arthur M. Corwin , chief of the White I-louse Secret Service detail , came quietly through the door . Corwin seldom smiled , yet no face in the White House seemed so full of good humor . Though his cheeks and mouth remained uncommitted , the littlecrinkles around his eyes gave him the look of a man who enjoyed everybody and everything about him . After fifteen years as a field agent -- dealing primarily with counterfeiters  --  he had been assigned to the White I louse under Lyman 's predecessor , Edgar Frazier . Lyman had chosen him to head the detail when the job opened up through retirement . The two men had taken a quick liking to each other on electionnight , when Corwin showed up at the governor 's mansion in Columbus to guard the new 1resident of the United States . Lyman knew without asking that Corwin had never cared for Frazier ; his respect for the agent increased when he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as a single casual word . Corwin was taller than the President , wide-shouldered and strong , the proud owner of a bristling crew cut . Though his interests were narrow ( Lyman was sure his chief bodyguard had n't read more than half a dozen books since graduating from Holy Cross ) , he read the newspapers carefully every day , trying to keep one step ahead of his boss in guessing where he might go , whom lie might see , and what visitors he might have in . Now he stood waiting in front of the desk . " Sit down , Art , " Lyman said . " I may be in a jam and I need your help . First , you ought to know that there 's another All89 / TUESDAY MORNINGRed alert scheduled for Saturday . You were n't to know until the last minute under the security plan . " In his fourth review of Casey 's story , Lyman found himself editing it , condensing some points , dwelling at length on others . As the events took sharper focus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Admiral Barnswell 's refusal to join Scott 's horse-race pool , and the crumpled note in Hardesty'shandwriting  --  stood out most sharply . Corwin seemed to think so too . " It 's awful hard , Mr. President , " he said , " to believe that anybody could fill up a big hunk of desert with men and suppliesand buildings and not have word get back to the White House somehow . " " That bothers me , too , Art , most of all , " Lyman said . " Of course , Casey is only guessing . He 's put two and two together and maybe he 's come up with five . But I sat down this morning and tried to list in my own mind all the classified bases we 've got , and I could n't do it . We have so many of them now , and so many levels of classification , that it would n't occur to most people to mention a particular one to me unless some decision had to be made about it . " Corwin said nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does he share my feeling of outrage at the mere thought that intelligent and capable  --  and trusted  --  Americans might be preparing a challenge to the Constitution ? Does he feel the same despair and frustration at the idea ? Does his loyalty , as a guard , run to the body or to the spirit of what he 's protecting ? " What do you think about it , Art ? " " I think I 'd better double the detail , with the men I know best , " Corwin replied quickly . " No , no , I do n't mean that . What do you think about the whole thing , the idea ? Does it make any sense to you ? " Corwin smiled for the first time , and Lyman thought he could read something like affection for him in the agent 's face . " Mr. President , " he said , " my predecessor on this job and I get together every once in a while . You 'd be surprised how we think of Presidents . As far as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAYS IN MAYyou 're all part babe in the woods and part fool . " Somebody is always trying to knock off the President , in one way or another . We shortstop a hundred letters a year from screwballs who want to cut your throat or poison you or drill you with a rifle . " Lyman smiled ruefully . " And Dr. Gallup must have talked to every one of them last week . " Corwin smiled politely , but was not to be diverted . " But with all of that , Presidents do the damnedest things . Remember when Truman stuck his head out the window in Blair House , right in the middle of that Puerto Rican thing , to see what all the shooting was about ' ? And Kennedy swimming all by himself fifty yards off his boat in cold water forty feet deep  --  and him with a bad back ? Or hiscnhower playing golf at Burning Tree ? Why , the woods are so thick along some of those fairways that a dozen nuts could have a shot out of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised a big hand to protest . " 13ut this is different , Art . If it 's ... if it 's true , this could be an operation to take over the Presidency , the office itself . " " It 's all the same to us , Mr. President , " Corwin answered . " We do n't trust anybody . Maybe you 'll laugh , but I find myself running an eye over some of your top people , even the Cabinet , looking for a bulge under their jackets . " " We 're not on the same wave length , Art , " Lyman insisted . " There is n't any danker , physical danger , to me in this . What this may be is it threat to the ollice I happen to hold . And , therefore , to the C'onstitution . " " It comes down to the same thing , sir . If anybody wants to take over the government , they have to get rid of you first somehow , or at least put you away  --  say in a back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see he was wasting time . Corwin refused to follow him into the realm of political philosophy . But did it really matter ' ? Corwin was chained to one task : the protection of the physical person of the President . Well , it might come down to that . And if the thing turned out to be an elaborate91 / TUESDAY MORNINGtissue of nothing , and Lyman became the laughing-stock of the country , at least Corwin would n't join the merriment . Or gossip , either . " Well , Art . We 're all going to meet this afternoon , at two , in the solarium , and I want you there . In the meantime , what would you think about trailing General Scott to see what he 's up to ? " Corwin grinned again . " Who says we 're not on the same wave length ? I was just going to suggest that . And you 've got the right man for it . I used to get plenty of practice when I was chasing those funny-money artists . " Esther came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting , but Lyman asked first for Frank Simon . The thin , wiry young press secretary , looking like a pinched owl behind his horn-rimmed glasses , hurried into the office . He was the best public relations technician in the business , but the mere sight of him always made Lyman feel a little jumpy , as though somebody had just scraped his nerve ends . " Frank , " he said , " I 'll have to scrub that eleven o'clock appointment with Donahue of the Fed . There are a lot of loose ends on the implementation of the treaty that some of us have to work out . But do n't tell the reporters that . Just say it 's been postponed because I 'm working on legislative matters . All right ? " Simon twitched his shoulders . " We 'll draw some snotty storiesif you cancel your only appointment today , after that poll yesterday . " " I ca n't help that , Frank . If the first stage of this disarmamentdoes n't come off exactly as we agreed , all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , Mr. President . " Simon 's shoulders hunched again . " It 's a lot easier to handle these things , though , if you can give me a little advance notice . I do n't do my best work in the dark . " If you only knew how dark , Lyman answered silently . Christopher Todd strode in , carrying his ever-present portfolio . An aura of assurance moved with him : Nothing was92 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYever out of place in Chris Todd 's world . At sixty , he had been Wall Street 's ranking corporate lawyer when Lyman called him to the Treasury . A ruddy , leathery tan bespoke his weekends as a yachtsman , formerly on the Sound , now on Chesapeake Bay . He wore a gray suit whose perfect tailoring was as elegantly inconspicuous as its discreet pattern . A darker gray tie was totally plain except for a tiny blue anchor in its center . His black shoes , bench made in England , were impeccably polished but not quite shiny . The gold watch chain across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Phi Beta Kappa key which reposed out of sight in a pocket at one end of the chain was his own . The press sketched Todd as " sharp , " " cold , " " cultivated , " " sardonic . " He was all that , and more . Lyman rose to greet him , then took from a desk drawer the box of fine panatela cigars that lie kept there especially for Todd . The President opened his own tobacco pouch and filled his pipe as Todd inspected a cigar , clipped it , and lit it with a kitchen match from a box in his coat pocket . Then Lyman told the story again . As he recounted it , this time in infinite detail , he could see Todd 's eyes brighten . The lawyer sat stiff in his chair , watchingLyman steadily except when he studied the end of his cigar . Lyman knew he was timing the ash . A good cigar , Todd believed ( and frequently proclaimed ) , must go at least fifteen minutes before it nee ( le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple question . " Well , what 's the verdict , Chris ? " Todd 's gray eyebrows arched upward . Foes of the Secretary found this habit of his particularly annoying , believing it indicated  --  as it usually ( lid- disdain or reproof . Lyman , however , was merely amused , as lie was by many of Todd 's calculatedtraits . " If I went into court as Scott 's counsel against that kind of nonsense , " said Todd , " I 'd move to quash the indictment and we 'd be out of the courthouse in ten minutes . " " I did n't offer it as evidence , " Lyman replied gently , " but as93 / TUESDAY MORNINGa presumption of evidence . You 're not the only lawyer in the room , Chris . " Todd 's blue eyes snapped . " Mr. President , there are no lawyersin Ohio . Only apprentices in the law . When they become lawyers , they move to New York . " " Or Washington , " the President said . He laughed as he relit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Todd began . " You obviously set great store by this ECOMCON business . Nobody has heard of it before . Not you , not Girard , not Fullerton , not this ColonelCasey . Well , then , what makes you think it does in fact exist ? We have only the colonel 's conjecture . He obviously has no facts . " " And the Hardesty note ? " asked Lyman . " That refers to it , and to a Site Y , the designation that Casey 's friend uses for his post near El Paso . " " That could easily mean another place . The proliferation of these secret bases has always seemed foolish to me . We confuse ourselves more than we do the Soviets . " " Well , we may have an answer to that this afternoon , " Lyman said . " Girard is checking out the location and designationof every classified installation . " " And as for flying troops to big cities in an alert , that seems to me not only logical but prudent . " Todd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck , we 'd need disciplined troops in the metropolitan areas to keep order and prevent complete breakdown . And , if I may say so , the conversion of a wagering pool on the Preakness into a code for some sinister plot to seize the government seems to me to have no foundation whatsoever . It 's sheer guesswork . Everybody knows General Scott loves horse races , and everyone who loves horse races bets on them . Colonel Casey 's deductive powers are lurid , to say the least . " Lyman leaned on the desk , supporting his chin in both hands . " Forget the details for a minute , Chris . What do you think of the over-all probability ? Do you think the mood of the94 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYcountry and the climate of military opinion make such an operation , let 's say , a possibility ? " " No , I do n't . " Todd studied the stump of his cigar before dropping it into the big desk ashtray . " But obviously , Mr. President , I realize we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd be guilty of gross negligence if we did n't . " Todd unsnapped his briefcase and took out a long yellow scratch pad . He jotted down a series of numbers with his pen . Opposite the first he wrote : " ECOMCON . " " Let 's just run through it all again , " he said . " I 'll study the last this noon and try to come up with a workable plan of investigationby this afternoon . I must say , though , Mr. President , you do n't have many investigators available . " " Try to change places with me in your mind , Chris , " Lyman said , " and then run through a list of a thousand friends and associates , and see how many you think you can trust completely . You 'll be surprised how few you come up with . " " Especially , " said Todd acidly , again arching his gray eyebrows , " if you weed out all those who you think might laugh at you when the monster vanishes out of the bedtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyman . " You 're not only a good big-city lawyer but a pretty fair country psychologist too . " They enumerated events and circumstances , item by item , until Todd had filled a page and a half with numbered notes . " A couple of things in here lead me to believe that your Colonel Casey has a vivid imagination , " Todd said . " For example , take Fred l'rentice 's remark about staying alert ' on Saturday . What earthly excuse is there for linking that to the All Red ? Alert ' is a word that anyone might use . " " I guess you might be right there , Chris . 1 suppose that once Casey got suspicious every casual remark took on some significanceit might not really have . But I think you have to look at it along with everything else . " " Well , I 'd better get back to my office , " Todd said , sliding the pad back into the case and snapping the catch , " and try to snake some sense out of this jumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio like a professor on his way to class . Through the door Lyman watched him bowing slightly to Esther as he passed her desk . Then she looked at the President and he beckoned to her . " Esther , " he said , " call Colonel Casey and tell hiin about the meeting . You do n't need to explain . But tell him to use the east entrance again . " Well , Lyman thought , in all of my little band of brothers , only two of us can see the forest for the trees ... if there is a forest . Only Ray Clark and I can see the big question . There ca n't be a constitutional struggle unless the atmosphere is right , unless people are really worried deep down in their bellies . Are they ? ... Good old Chris . He 's intrigued by the idea of a conspiracy . You can tell it from his eyes , even if he wo n't admit it . But it 's all a matter of evidence , of wit- nesses , with him .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . Paul sees it as a simple power struggle between Scott and myself . Casey ? He 's just an officer , doing his duty as he sees it . They 're all on the side of the angels , the President mused , and I could n't ask for better people . But I ca n't make them understand why it 's important . They all think it is , each for his own reasons , but those reasons are n't good enough . I 've got to try to make them see it my way , and only Clark sees it that way now ... but does he ? Is he worried about the coun- try ? He thinks he is , but I do n't know . I do n't know if you really can worry about it , no matter who you are and how much you think , unless you sit in this chair here . Alone . Sometimes I think no one except the President ever thinks of the country , all of it . I wonder if anyone else can , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the long windows that stretched from ceiling to floor . The heavy May rain continued to beat down on the hedges , the rose bushes , the rhododendrons , and the big shiny leaves of the magnolia tree . A guard , his head pulled into the turned-up collar of a black rubber raincoat , sloshed along the curving driveway . The President stood96 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYwatching , smoking , silently cursing the weather  --  and the myopia of men . In the pressroom , reporters and photographers were playingwild poker , dealer 's choice . Quarters and half dollars clinked noisily on the table . Three telephones were ringing . Milky Waters had his feet on his desk as he talked with Hugh Ulanski of United Press International . The noncommittal tone Waters used with politicians and other news sources was not in evidence now . As dean of the White House press corps , he spoke with authority among his peers . " I ca n't figure the guy , " he said . " The day after a national poll comes out showing him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment  --  and cancels that one . " " Maybe he 's a secret nudist , " suggested Ulanski , " and he 's contemplating his navel . " " You got the wrong religion for navel watching , son , but the right idea . I like the guy , but if he 's a politician I 'm a sword swallower . " Simon came into the pressroom . Waters left his feet up but reached for a notebook . The poker game paused expectantly . " It 's nothing much , " the press secretary said , fingering his dark-rimmed glasses . " I was asked what legislative matters ' the President is working on this morning . I have n't got to him yet , but I 'll have it for you at the afternoon briefing . " " Frank , you 've given me an idea for my overnight . " It was Ulanski . " Instead of my day lead , which said the President did nothing , I 'll say the president is worn out from doing nothing , and has been ordered to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile left . The poker game resumed . The rain continued . Jiggs Casey 's morning in the caverns of the Pentagon was as gloomy as the weather outside . A rising torrent of conflictingconjectures had been flooding his mind from the moment he got out of bed . The ashtray on his desk had doubled its normal accumulation of cigarette stubs , and he had decided that his career as a Marine was finished. 97 / TUESDAY MORNINGWhat crazy impulse had sent him to the White House with that nightmare story ? How could he have thought of implicatinga man of Scott 's stature in a plot that had no basis except a frayed string of coincidences ? And he had betrayed his own service . Marines do n't do that . The feeling of disloyalty to his own kind put Casey in an ugly humor . Every time he tried to think concisely about the episodes that had made such an impression on him yesterday his emotions pulled him back to his own plight . Probably by this time the President had called for his service record and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God , at least there 's nothing like that in it . Or maybe Lyman had just called General Scott direct and told him the director of the Joint Staff needed a mental examination . The last possibility was still in Casey 's mind when , shortly after ten o'clock , he was summoned to Scott 's office . Well , here it comes , he thought as he walked down the hall . Add one Marine to the retired list . Scott 's greeting was friendly as he motioned Casey to a chair . In addition to the usual buoyancy , Casey thought he noted an almost jovial air . " Jiggs , " the General said , " you 've been working too hard on the alert . I want you to take the rest of the week off . Why do n't you and Marge duck down to White Sulphur and blow yourselves to a good time ? " Casey had expected almost anything but this . He shook his head . " I could n't do that , sir , " he said . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General . I just would n't feel right . " Scott waved aside the objection with a sweep of his cigar . " Not a thing to worry about . Murdock can handle anything in that line . You 're tired . I can sense it . " " Sir , I want to be up at Mount Thunder with you on Saturday , " Casey protested . " Well , that 's all right . You just check back in on the job Saturday morning , then , and pick it up as planned from there . But in the meantime , let 's call it a three-day pass . " Casey started to say something , but Scott cut him off. 98 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " Look , Jiggs , I 've thought about this . Frankly , word that you 're gone will spread around fast . Nobody would think an alert was in the works with the director gone . Consider yourselfpart of the security cover . And remember , you ca n't think only about Saturday . I 'd rather have you around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one exercise letterperfecton Saturday . " Casey tried to keep his voice from faltering . " When do you think I should leave , sir ? " " Right now , " boomed Scott . " Walk out and go home . Kiss Marge for me . " He walked Casey to the door and squeezed his arm . " See you Saturday , Jiggs . Have fun . " Before his short ride home was half over , Casey had settled on a depressing diagnosis . President Lyman had called Scott , told him of the night visit to the White - louse , and the two men had agreed that Casey was a good officer who badly needed a rest . Yes , that must be it . Calm of a kind returned to Casey . Ile thanked the driver in front of his house and ran for the front door , splashing through the puddles . The empty carport indicated that Marge was out on some kind of errand . That 's one break anyway , he thought . It 'll give me a little time to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he opened the door . He answeredit while water trickled off his raincoat onto the floor . " Colonel Casey ' ? " " This is Colonel Casey . " Ile did n't recognize the caller 's voice . " Colonel , this is Esther Townsend at the White House . Your secretary said you had gone home . You are asked to attend a meeting at two o'clock . Please use the east entrance . The guard will have your name . Take the same elevator you did last night , but go to the third floor . It will be in the solarium , to your left , directly above the study . " " Yes , ma'am . I 'll be there . " " Thank you , Colonel . The President said you did n't need to be informed of the subject matter . " 99 / TUESDAY MORNINGCasey removed his raincoat and cap in a daze , ignoring the water that had collected on the floor . He unbuttoned his blouse and loosened his tie , then slumped into a chair in the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't a bad dream after all . The President must have done some quick checking and decided he was right . That this meant trouble only heightened Casey 's excitement . But why the sudden offer by Scott of a three-day vacation ? Offer , hell  --  he had been ordered to get out of the office . Had the General learned that Casey had driven past his house last night ? Maybe a sentry recognized him or wrote down his licensenumber . Or maybe Mutt Henderson had told Broderick of Casey 's interest in ECOMCON , and Broderick had tipped off Scott . Had Murdock gotten suspicious ? Of what ? Casey knew he had given Murdock no cause for alarm . Maybe more coded traffic on the Saturday operation was due to go out and they wanted Casey out of the way so he would n't see the dispatches . In the Armed Services Committee room in the old Senate Office Building , Senator Raymond Clark took his place , just to the right of the chairman 's seat at the head of the table . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of the long , baize-covered table . In the witness chair at the other end , General Scott was waiting to testify . Admiral Lawrence Palmer , the chief of Naval Operations , sat beside him . Behind them , on folding metal chairs , was a row of colonels and commanders , fiddling with the documents in their fat briefcases . Scott whispered with his aide , Colonel Murdock , whose head snipped up and down as he nodded agreement . The left side of Scott 's blouse blazed with six rows of battle decorations and service ribbons . He was , as always , totally relaxed and confident in manner . Clark eyed Scott with fresh interest . There is n't the slightestdoubt about it , he thought , that fellow is the most impressivemilitary man this town has seen in twenty years. 100 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYSenator Frederick Prentice came in from his private office through a door held open by the committee clerk . The chairmannodded to Scott and Palmer before sitting down in his black-leather chair . He took a deliberate , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment putting the other committee members in the same category of personal property as the green-veined marble pillars , the service flags heavy with battle streamers , and the beautifully ornate crystal chandeliers . Prentice slapped a folder of papers on the table and rapped his gavel once . The clerk hung a sign , " Executive Session , " on the outside of the main door , then closed and locked it . " We are meeting late this morning , " Prentice said , " in order to accommodate General Scott . However , we have the consent of the Senate to sit during the session , so we will not have to adjourn at noon . We 'll just go ahead until one o'clock , which will give us an hour and a half , if that is satisfactory to the senators . " Prentice looked to his right and left , then tapped the gavel again . " Very well . General Scott , you may proceed . You had almostfinished with your over-all presentation last week , and I would hope there would n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Palmer and the Navy . General ? " Scott leaned back in his chair and pressed his fingers down on the edge of the table . His shoulders tightened with the pressure . He began slowly . " I think we had covered all weapons systemsexcept the l ( 'IIM family . acre , as the committee knows , we believe we have more than closed the so-called missile gap of the late fifties and early sixties , and we are now moving rapidly to bring in the Olympus , which should put us well ahead of the Soviet in thrust as well as accuracy . " Needless to say , the Joint Chiefs view the current missile strikes with the utmost concern , since they involve almost entirelythe production lines for Olympus . As you know , the treaty requires us to dismantle only the warheads . The missiles themselves can be built  --  and should be . They will provide us101 / TUESDAY MORNINGwith some insurance , no matter how fragile , in the very critical months ahead . " Prentice , ignoring his own injunction against interruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are you satisfied that other departmentsof the executive branch are doing all they can to terminatethis completely unauthorized stoppage over some petty jurisdictional dispute ? " There was a slight stir among some of the committee Democrats . Scott glanced along the table , and when he replied his words were tactfully restrained . " I can not reply directly , Mr. Chairman . I assume that is the case . I know the President called in the head of the AFL-CIO yesterday on the subject . I have not yet been informed of the outcome . " " Do n't you think you should be kept up to date , " asked Prentice , " considering your responsibilities in this field ? " Scott smiled . " Well , Mr. Chairman , I fully expect to be kept posted , but  --  " Senator George Pappas , an Illinois Democrat and a loyal supporter of the Lyman administration , broke in . " This line of questioning is totally unproductive , " he said . " The chairman knows the White House is doing its best in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is confidentit will be taken care of . I think we might remember that General Scott is n't supposed to be a labor arbitrator . " " I just want the record clear as to where we stand , " Prentice said . " I think it 's already clear where some people stand , " snapped Pappas . Prentice smiled . " Let 's move ahead , General , please , now that the distinguished senator from Illinois has cleared the air in his usual fashion . " " Mr. Chairman  --  " said Pappas angrily , but Prentice snapped the gavel against the table to cut him off . Scott talked , lucidly and decisively , for a quarter of an hour , ending his discussion of missiles with a summary of the entire defense situation . He wasted no words , yet managed to102 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYpaint a detailed and vivid picture of the nation 's strength . " Of course , " he concluded , " the Joint Chiefs and the rankingfield commanders all feel that the next six weeks are critical . Knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it suits their convenience , we intend to maintain our forces on a more or less constant alert until the treaty goes into effect . " Prentice cleared his throat . " Thank you , General . The chairman will confine himself to one question . In connection with your last statement , do you think the United States is in more danger , or less danger , since the ratification of the nucleardisarmament treaty ? " Scott picked up the pencil that lay on the table in front of him and doodled on the memo pad placed there by the committeestaff . A good half minute passed before he answered , and when he spoke it was in a measured , almost gentle tone . " If I might be permitted a personal allusion , Mr. Chairman , this country has been awfully good to me . " The committee was intent on Scott 's words . " It is probably a cliche to say that I came from humble beginnings , but it is true . " It never occurred to me , really , until I entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with all citizens , of a really unique system of government . " I came to the Point in 1934 . I think the committee would agree that you could hardly describe that as a year in which our system was operating at its optimum level . But it did not take long for the Academy to make quite clear to me the virtuesof our form of government and the differences between the American and other societies . " Everything that I saw in the war years reinforced my feelingson this subject , as did my contacts with other societies in the Far East and , more recently , the Near East . " I must say , speaking now on a completely personal basis , and not in my official capacity , that I have been disturbed , over a period of years , at indications that Americans do not always recognize the full dimensions of the threats to them and to this . . . this marvelous system under which we live . I103 / TUESDAY MORNINGthink that an examination of the period of the late thirties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of early 1961 , and of more recent years would indicate at least the shadow of a recurring pattern , a pattern of what might be called complacency ' or wishful thinking . ' " I apologize for this rather indirect answer to your question , Mr. Chairman . But what I would like to say is this , really : I hope we are not now entering another such period . We have , as I said , a system in this country that we all want to protect and preserve . It is my personal feeling that we are approaching a critical period , as critical or more so than any in the past thirty years , because of the fact that the government has decided to attempt a nuclear disarmament treaty . " The committee is quite familiar with the reasoning of the Joint Chiefs in connection with the treaty . There is no point in my going over that again , except to say that the Chiefs still believe that the treaty is too vague on the question of inspection of new nuclear construction . We still contend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build ten new Z-4 warheads , for example , at some unknown and undetected location , at the same time that he is disarming ten Z-4 's from the stockpile , under inspection , on July 1 . " So I do believe we are entering a period so dangerous that we may face some factors that are totally unexpected . Our system , which has meant so much to me personally and which we all want to see sustained , does contain some features which might make it vulnerable . I am sure that none of us would want to see that system used to bring about the collapse of the very things it has made possible . So , obviously , to the extent that we may encounter new or unexpected problems , to that extent there is increased danger . " Scott stopped speaking and dropped his hands from the edge of the table into his lap . Senator Raymond Clark squared the papers in front of him . That was quite a testament , General , he thought . I wonder if we 've got you figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He beamed104 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYopenly and proudly . " General , I think I speak for the entire committee when I say I regret very much that we have no written record of your magnificent statement . I only wish that all Americans could have heard it . . . . Now , the members of the committee may have some questions . Let 's keep them as brief as possible , so we can get on to Admiral Palmer . " He nodded to Clark , the next-ranking Democrat . The Georgian looked at Scott . Well , he thought , it is n't going to sound very good after your lines , but I better go to work . " General , " he began , " I can only echo what the chairman has said about your statement . Now , there is just one point about which I am curious . You may have covered it at a session I missed . What are we doing to safeguard our communicationsfacilities , telephone long lines , television cables , broadcasting facilities , things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no change in Scott 's intent expression . " Without going into detail , Senator , " the General said , " I think I can assure you that adequate provisions have been made . Communications have always been the lifeline of any military establishment , and they are of course far more so today . We fully realize that , and have acted on that realiza-tion . " " I 'd appreciate it if you could amplify just a bit , " Clark suggested . Scott smiled , almost apologetically . " Senator , this is a quite sensitive subject , and I 'm not sure this is the time or place to  --  " " The committee simply does not have time . " It was Prentice , cutting in . " We ca n't start into anything of that scope today . We 're on the verge of a recess here , Senator Clark , and we must get to Admiral Palmer . " " I notice , Mr. Chairman , " said Clark quietly , " that you had time to raise a question about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if the committee could indulge me for just a moment . " " Much of the communications field is highly classified , " 105 / TUESDAY MORNINGPrentice snapped . " The General does n't have time today to sort out what he can properly tell the committee and what he ca n't " " Oh , now , Mr. Chairman . " Clark was still slouched in his chair but his voice was cold . " There has n't been a leak from this committee in my memory . And there is a long record of complete disclosure to it by the defense establishment , going back even as far , if I am correctly informed , as 1945 , when details of the Manhattan project were made available several months before the first atomic bomb was used . " Murdock leaned over and whispered to Scott while Clark was talking . The General nodded agreement and gestured to Prentice . " If I may interject , Mr. Chairman , " he said , " the committee knows that we had a practice alert some weeks ago . What it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our complete satis- faction . We had trouble , in particular , with some of the com- munications . We are getting the bugs out now , I think , and I 'd prefer to wait a few weeks  --  say , until after the Congressional recess  --  when we can give the committee a full report that would include any revisions we may decide to make . " Prentice beamed gratefully down at Scott . " Is that a satis- factory solution ? " he asked Clark . " No , it is n't , " Clark replied . " I think we are entitled to some information now . Further , I do n't want to leave even the slightest impression that the senator from Georgia thinks any member of this committee can not be trusted with sensitive in- formation . " " There was certainly no such implication intended on my part , Senator , " Scott said , " and I would hope there would be no such inference drawn . Frankly , this is an involved subject , on which I think the committee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just are not equipped to provide that this morning . " Prentice used his gavel . " I can personally assure the dis- guished senator , " he said , bearing down on the word " distinguished , " " that our communications are secure . Now , un-106 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYless the senator wishes to force a vote of the committee , I think we will proceed . If there are no other questions for General Scott , we will hear Admiral Palmer . " He glanced at the other senators . None of them spoke and Prentice brought the gavel down again . " Without objection . Admiral Palmer . " The Admiral 's testimony consumed a half hour . When he finished and the meeting was adjourned , Clark stopped briefly at his own office and then left the building to eat lunch . The rain had slackened to a drizzle , but the overcast still hung oppressivelylow . From the office building only a faint outline of the Capitol dome , half a block away , could be seen . General Scott 's limousine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb . Scott was holding the door open for someone . Even from behind him Clark recognized the square bulk of Senator Prentice . The two settled on the rear seat and the car pulled away on the wet asphalt . As it did so , a gray sedan slithered out of a parking place down the block , heading in the same direction . When it passed Clark , he noticed the driver . He had seen him hundreds of times : it was Art Corwin . So you 've put us all to work already , Jordie , thought Clark . Well , you 'd better , Yankee boy . There 's plenty to find out  --  and maybe not much time left to find it out in . Christ , he thought , I need a drink . Clark hesitated on the sidewalk , made a half-motion to turn back toward his office . Then he jammed his hands in his raincoat pockets and stepped doggedly off the curb toward the restaurant he had decided on earlier . It was only a block away , the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tuesday AfternoonShortly before two o'clock , Esther Townsend brought a brown manila envelope to President Lyman , who was in the upstairs study . " You did n't ask for this , Governor , " she said , " hut Art Corwinthought you might want it before the meeting . Do n't ask me how he got it . " Lyman cut the envelope open and drew out a thin cardboardfolder . The tab on the side , lettered by hand in ink , read : " CASEY , Martin Jerome . " It was Colonel Casey 's service record ; Lyman suddenly realized that though he was commander in chief of the armed forces , he had never before seen an officer'sservice file . He thumbed through it , retracing Casey 's career in the biographical card , proficiency reports , medical examinations , and citations . Quite a substantial officer , he thought . Indeed , quite a brave officer . A sheaf of papers near the end of the file caught his attention and he read them carefully . Lyman went up to the third floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the solarium . He found Christo-107108 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYpher Todd already established in one of the heavy leather chairs . Jordan Lyman did n't use this room often , but he liked it . Added by Harry Truman when the house was rebuilt in 1951 , it was all plate glass , steel , and linoleum tile , low-ceilingedand unadorned , completely unlike any other room in the mansion . Eisenhower had used it for bridge games . The Kennedys removed the wicker ' furniture , added a couple of knee-high sinks in an alcove , and turned it into a playroom for Caroline and John Jr . The Fraziers left it that way for their own grandchildren , but Doris Lyman had redone it as a hideawayfor her husband . Lyman retained one memento from Caroline 's tenancy  --  a blue plastic duck which squatted quizzicallyon the window sill . The morning rain and noontime drizzle had subsided into a solid mist that beaded the angular , five-panel window and made the room seem almost like the bridge of a ship at sea in a heavy fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house on a day like this , " grumbled Todd . " I feel like a man trying to navigate the Sound in a pea-souper . " " I know what you mean , " Lyman said , " hut there 's no telephoneup here and only one door . Maybe no place is secure enough for our kind of business , but I feel better here . " Todd pointed to the little bar in the alcove . A half dozen bottles and an ice bucket stood ready . " Do you think it 's a good idea to tempt Senator Clark that way ? " he asked . " Look , Chris , I know Ray has hit the bottle pretty hard for the last couple of years since Martha ( lied . But in a pinch he 's all right , better than most of us . I happen to know that from Korea . " " In Korea he had n't met his wife and lost her , " Todd argued . " It looks like an engraved invitation to me . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finality . Girard , Clark and Corwin turned up , one at a time , in thenext few minutes , and Casey stepped through the doorway withmilitary punctuality at just two o'clock . Lyman introduced him109 / TUESDAY AFTERNOONto Todd , who had never met him . Casey fidgeted as the Treasurychief appraised him from crew cut to cordovans , much as he might eye the timbers and rigging of a new sloop . When they were all seated , the President put on his glasses and pulled two pages from the envelope containing Casey 's service record . " This is a report on Colonel Casey 's last complete medical examination , " he explained . " It was done at Bethesda two years ago , when he was promoted to colonel . I wo n't read it all , but I think you will be interested in one comment from the psychiatristwho examined him . Quote : This officer is normal in all respects . He exhibits no anxieties , has no phobias and is free from even the minor psychiatric disturbances common to a man of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given such a clean bill of mental health . ' Unquote . " Lyman , Clark and Corwin grinned at Casey as the Marine reddened slightly . " Well , " Casey said , " I thought I might be going nuts this morning until Miss Townsend called me . It was the longest four hours of my life . " " Be happy to be regarded as totally sane , Colonel , " said Todd . " There are few men in this city of whom as much could be said with confidence . " " I took this rather unorthodox step , " said Lyman , " because I wanted to settle all doubts at once . Jiggs may be mistaken in his analysis of recent events  --  that we 'll find out  --  but he 's producedit out of a sound mind . Now , I think the best way to proceed is to turn things over to Chris Todd . He 's the prosecuting attorney , so to speak , and at least for this afternoon it 's his show . " The Cabinet officer pulled black-framed spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yellow legal-length scratch pad . " We all know Colonel Casey 's story , " Todd began , " but as I understand it , he is not aware of several things President Lyman mentioned to the rest of us . " Speaking to Casey , Todd told of General Rutkowski 's call110 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYseveral months before ; of Vice-President Gianelli 's revelation that Prentice had suggested he spend the weekend in his ancestralvillage in Italy ; of the FBI file on Harold MacPherson 's extremist affiliations , and of Scott 's insistence that Lyman fly from Camp David to Mount Thunder for the alert without accompanyingnewspapermen . " If you 'd known all that , Jiggs , you might have brought the Marines with you last night , " quipped Clark . " The Marines , " said Todd coldly , " are reported to be with General Scott this week , Ray , or had n't you heard ? " Casey looked at Lyman . He was obviously anxious to say something , and the President nodded . " You do n't know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged me  --  no , ordered is more like it  --  to take a three-day leave this morning . I was home before noon . " " Any reason ? " asked Todd . " No , sir , not much . He just said I looked tired and ought to take some time off . Of course , he may have heard something from Murdock or one of the guards at Fort Myer . " " Umm . " Todd wrote on his yellow pad , but did not seem overly impressed . " Is there anything else new bearing on the . . . ah . . . situation ? " he asked . There was an uncomfortable moment of silence . We 're a funny crew , Casey thought . 1 F.ach man here is tied to the President , but not to any of the others . Except me . I do n't know any of these men except Paul . I wonder how the President picked this group ? Casey was puzzling over the absence of " big " names from Congress and the Cabinet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications , and of Scott 's putting him off by explaining that there were changes under way because of failures in the last alert . " Is that right , Jiggs ' ? " Lyman asked . " No , sir , " said Casey quickly . " That is not true . About the only thing that went right with the last All Red was communications . Even the big master cut-in , the one that allows us to111 / TUESDAY AFTERNOONtake over the networks , worked perfectly , in spite of the fact that it had never been tested before . " " Score another for Gentleman Jim , " said Girard . " And I always thought he was a real Boy Scout . " " Well , he gave a wonderful imitation of one this morning , " Clark said . " He laid down a personal statement for the committeethat was about as fine as I ever heard . " He went on to quote the General on the treaty and his fears of Russian duplicity . " Of course , " said Lyman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean Scott 's character . Even to consider tamperingwith the Constitution requires a certain kind of personality  --  overly ambitious and a little bit warped . Scott has always impressed me as just the opposite . I 've never doubted his sincerity , nor his feeling for the country either . After all , I appointed him chairman of the Joint Chiefs . How about it , Jiggs ? " " That 's why I waited so long yesterday , " Casey said hesitantly . " General Scott has never been a conniver . We have them in the service , sir , just like you have them , I guess , in politics . But the General is always straightforward . He always says that he could never have gone so far in any other coun-try . " " As I say , " Clark added , " he struck that same note this morning . And I could n't detect any false overtones either . " " That 's what I mean , " Casey said . " I guess you all remember that old joke about MacArthur , how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthem and say , They 're playingour song , dear ' ? Well , I 've always kind of thought it was Scott 's song . " Casey paused a moment , then added : " So his misstatements to me yesterday hit me pretty hard . " " You mean lies , do n't you , Colonel ? " asked Todd quickly . " Well , yes , sir . " " I just think we 'll make more progress if we 're completely frank , " Todd said tartly . " It will save time . " They waited for the President to resume his discourse on112 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYScott , but Lyman , busying himself with the filling and firing of his pipe , said nothing . Todd went back to his check list . " Anything else new ? " " I followed Scott today , " offered Corwin , " as the President directed . When he left the Senate hearing this morning , Senator Prentice got in the car with him . They drove to General Scott 's quarters at Fort Myer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Riley drove up , and then General Dieffenbach arrived in an Army car . They were still there when I had to leave . Must be a pretty long lunch . " " Admiral Palmer was not there ? " asked Todd . " Nope . No sign of him . " Todd tapped his pencil on his teeth . His brows gathered in thought . He was clearly enjoying his role as chief diagnostician . " As you know , " he said , " Palmer was not at the chiefs ' meetingyesterday . That did not seem particularly significant , but his absence today makes it look more interesting . The only member of the Joint Chiefs not present . Mr. President , I have an idea . " " All right , Chris , shoot . " " Why do n't you call Barney Rutkowski ? You could remind him of his earlier conversation and find out if anything has developedsince that he knows of . ' Fell him you want him to fly in here and talk to you in confidence . Then , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pretext and sound him out . It might he very illuminating . " " Do you suppose Barney knows Palmer ? " asked Clark . Casey had an answer . " All the chiefs have visited the Air Defense Command . They go there at least once a year . " He chuckled . " So do I. I veryhody likes Colorado Springs . " " That 's good enough , " said Todd . " What do you think , Mr. President ? " Lyman walked to one of the windowpanes and rubbed a finger across it . He did n't improve the visibility ; the mist was on the outside . " I rather like the idea , " he said. 113 / TUESDAY AFTERNOON " But do n't let Rutkowski know what 's bothering you , " Todd said . " This business , I mean . " Corwin , sitting at the door , snapped his fingers and held up a hand for silence . A moment later there was a knock at the door . The Secret Service man opened it a little  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside  --  and then , recognizing Esther Townsend , threw it wide . The secretary was all smiles . " Sorry to interrupt , Mr. President , " she said , " but you just became a grandfather . A baby girl . Liz is doing fine . " " Oh , my God . " Lyman got up quickly . " I completely forgot about that . I meant to call Doris this morning . Gentlemen , excuse me for a minute , will you ? I have to call Mrs. Lyman . " " Never mind the cigars , " Clark said . " I 'll buy for the house  --  from your stock downstairs . " " While you 're down there , " said Todd , as if he had not heard Esther , " why not call Rutkowski , Mr. President ? Time 's run-ning . " The connection to the hospital in Louisville was already open when Lyman reached his bedroom on the floor below . His wife Doris , cheerful as ever , bubbled happily over the wire . Liz was fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had waited a few minutes before calling to make sure Liz was all right . The baby was all in one piece , with the right number of everything , and nicely wrinkled . Would it be all right to name it Florence , after Lyman 's mother ? " Whatever the kids want , " Lyman said happily . " And , honey , kiss Liz for me . And tell Ed he 's a great man . " Another button on Lyman 's phone winked insistently . He told Doris to hang on and pushed it . It was Frank Simon on the other line . " Mr. President , " said the press secretary , " Esther told me you were calling Louisville . How about letting the photographerscome up for a shot of you ? We could use it . The boys in the pressroom think you 're sick . " " Sure , sure . " Lyman was excited . " Bring ' em up , Frank . " 114 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYThe photographers trooped in just as Lyman was telling his wife that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) she might as well wait until Monday . Too much doing on the treaty to give him any free time anyway , he said . " That 's an awful serious look for a new grandfather , Mr. President , " said Pete Schnure of AP photos . " How about a smile , huh ? " Lyman obliged to the accompaniment of a brief barrage of flashbulbs , but he shook his head when they asked for more . Simon palmed his charges out the door into the oval study . The President wound up his talk with his wife , then made sure they had started down on the elevator before asking Esther to get him General Rutkowski at the Air Defense Command on a normal commercial line . It took several minutes . " This is Jordan Lyman , Barney . How are you ? " " Fine , Mr. President . " The voice was strong and confident . " Barney , you remember that call you made to me several months ago ? " " Very clearly , sir . " " Has there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter ? " " No , sir . I indicated at the time I did n't think such a conversationwould be proper , and that 's the last I heard of it . " " Barney , something quite important may have come up . Could you fly in here tonight ? " " Certainly , sir . I can leave in an hour or two . " " Please keep it in confidence , Barney . Invent some other excuse . I mean I 'd rather it was n't known that you 're coming to see mc . " " No trouble at all , Mr. President . I always have business in Washington . In fact , I planned to conic next week anyway . Shall I call you when I get in ? " " Please . Just ask for Miss Townsend . She 'll find me . " Corwin was spluttering with laughter when Lyman returned to the solarium . Casey was wiping his eyes and even Todd wore a smile . Clark had been entertaining . " And speaking of doctors , " he said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company with maternity-ward humor  --  " reminds me of 01 ' Doc , who ran against me in a primary one time . He used to collect his campaign funds on the spot , after he worked the crowds up with a good long speech . He 'd stand there , all pink and sweaty with beer and righteousness , and call out the denomination of the bills as they handed ' em to him . Ten more for the campaign pot , ' like that . Well , one time a fat-cat auto dealer down in south Georgia passed him a fifty-dollar bill . 01 ' Doc , he looked at it , and looked at it again , and damn near fainted  --  and then stuffed it into his pocket and sung out loud and clear , Ten more for the campaignpot ! ' " They all congratulated Lyman . Clark said it ought to add at least five points to his next poll rating . Girard proposed a toast , nodding toward the portable bar , but the President shook his head . His mind was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , " he said . " I 'll send him over to see Palmer . But , Chris , I want some thought given to the way Barney should be handled . It has to be just right . " Todd nodded and scribbled a note on the top of his pad . Then he ran his pen down his list again . " The first thing to straighten out , " he said , " is this ECOMCON business . Do we have any solid evidence at all that it exists , aside from Colonel Casey 's talk with Henderson and the Hardesty note ? I gather we do n't . " Lyman nodded at Girard . " Paul , give us that list of classifiedbases you got this morning . " Girard read off a list of seventeen installations . All but five were outside the continental limits . Two of those five , Mount Thunder and a special area at Camp Ritchie in Maryland , were underground retreats for top government officials in case of a nuclear war . The other three were the sites of vaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no base near El Paso , and none with the ECOMCON designation or a similar mission . Nor was any of the bases , at home or abroad , known to Fullerton by the " Site Y " designation. 116 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " He said the only time that tag was used , so far as he knows , was for Los Alamos where they made the atomic bomb in 1945 , " Girard said . " I could not have recited that list from memory , " Lyman said , " but I know that each installation on it was specifically authorized by myself or one of my predecessors . Furthermore , on the day after my inauguration I was briefed on each classifiedbase then in existence . I am positive there has never been any discussion of any installation of a secret nature near El Paso . " " That clarifies my point , " said Todd . " There appears to be nothing in writing anywhere to indicate that this base does in fact exist . With all due respect to Colonel Casey , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of business is to find out ? " asked Lyman . " Precisely , " Todd replied . " I3ut how ? Of course , the normalprocedure would be for you , Mr. President , to call General Scott and ask him . If he denied it , you would then order him to accompany you on an inspection trip to the El Paso area . If there were no base , you would fire Colonel Casey and apologize to Scott . If there were one , you would disperse the ECOMCON troops and dismiss Scott on a charge of in-subordination . " The five men looked at the President . Lyman smiled patientlyat Todd . " Are you seriously suggesting that course of action , Chris ? " he asked . " No , " Todd said , " I am merely saying that would be the normal way for a President to act , under normal circum-stances . " Girard moved in . " Look , Mr. Secretary . If there turned out to be no base , the story would be plastered all over every paper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool , and the administration would n't be worth the baling wire it would take to hold it together . That 's not politics , Mr. Secretary . It 's lunacy . " 117 / TUESDAY AFTERNOON " But of course we assume the base does exist , or we would n't be here . " Todd 's temper was rising . " Look at the other side , Chris , " said Lyman . " Let 's say we find the base and I demand Scott 's resignation . I suppose his reply would be that I had authorized the base orally . We 'd set up a fight in Congress and the newspapers that could literally tear the country in half . " " Christ , yes , " added Girard acidly . " The llouse would vote a bill of impeachment within a week , with the mood the country 's in . They 'd say the boss was out of his mind . And much as I love him , you put his word against Scott 's right now and I would n't bet a dime on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lyman . His voice was sarcastic , but his smile was tolerant  --  and agreeing . " Wait a minute , all of you , " Todd said . " I 'm not advocating this . It 's just that my instinct always is to sail the shortest course for the harbor in a squall . " " That 's why you 're the Secretary of the Treasury , by appointment , instead of being a senator or governor by election , Chris . " Lyman spoke slowly , in schoolmaster fashion , as men do to friends outside their trade . " We 're really at the heart of the matter here , aside from Scott 's character itself , and it 's a political judgment : Is this thing possible  --  really ? I 've spent most of the last twenty-four hours thinking about that . " The President got up from his chair in his gawky way and walked halfway around the room to lean against the center window sill . He crossed his feet as though trying to hide their size and fussed with his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jiggs 's visit last night brought into focus a lot of things that have troubled me since I took over this job . I hope you can stand a little philosophy ; I think it goes to the guts of this thing . " Ever since that first atomic explosion at Hiroshima , something has been happening to man 's spirit . It 's not surprising , really . Up until then a man could have some feeling that even in a terrible war he had some control over his existence. 118 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYNot much , maybe , but still some . The bomb finished that . Everybody 's first thought was that it would end war . Everybody'ssecond thought was that if it did n't , he was at the mercy of the people who had the bombs . Then came the hydrogen bombs and now these awful neutron weapons . " Civilization can go with a moan and a whimper overnight . Everybody knows it . But how can an individual feel anything but helpless ? He ca n't grab a rifle and rush out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help much by joining the Navy and serving on a missile submarine . He 'd know that if he ever got an order to fire , it would mean that his home was probably already a pile of ashes  --  or would be in fifteen minutes . " The room was still . Todd , sunk in his chair , had let his pad slip to the floor . Corwin sat straight against the door . Casey noiselessly stubbed out a cigarette and clasped his hands behind his thick neck . " None of that means much to the dictatorships , " Lyman went on . " In a monolithic state-  - -  and that 's what Russia has been for centuries , under czars and commissars both  --  people never get used to influencing their government , and they do n't miss it . But a democracy is different . Each of us has got to feel that we can influence events , no matter how slight the influence . When people start believing they ca n't they get frustrated , and angry . They feel helpless and they start going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the Birch society , now the popularity of this fanatic Mac-Pherson . " Lyman paused and looked at his companions . Todd took the cue . " Granting all that , Mr. President , " he said , " you 'll recall that when General Walker  --  remember , that division commanderin Germany- - got out of line in 1961 , President Kennedy wasted no time relieving him . " " That 's exactly my point , Chris , and a good example of it , " Lyman said . " Kennedy was quite popular then , and opinion was clearly on his side . But since then this climate119 / TUESDAY AFTERNOONI 'm talking about has got steadily worse . People have seriously started looking for a superman . Do n't think I could n't feel that in the campaign . I guess I sounded like one in that acceptancespeech , too , thanks to Ray . " Clark chuckled . " We only had eighteen words in that punch line , but I bet we worked on it for two hours . " " Wise men  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any supermen , " Lyman resumed . " The trouble is that democracy works only when a good majority of citizens are willing to give thought and time and effort to their government . The nuclear age , by killing man 's faith in his ability to influence what happens , could destroy the United States even if no bombs were ever dropped . That 's why I decided I had to bring off that treaty if it was the only thing I ever did . " Lyman shook his head . " I do n't know if it 's enough , though . Maybe it 's coming too late . The climate for democracy in this country is the worst it 's ever been . Maybe General Scott thinks he holds salvation in his hands . If he does , he 's pitifullymistaken , and I feel sorry for him . " The President sat slouched on the sill of the big window , his wiry hair rumpled and his hands and feet looking ridiculouslylarge and awkward . It occurred to Casey that he looked more like a country poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all conscious of it . Clark finally broke it with a loud , " A-men , Brother Lyman ! " Lyman chuckled and gestured to Todd . " That 's enough from the revival tent , I guess , even though I really mean it , " he said . " Let 's get back on the track , Chris . " " Well , I assume that accepting your reasoning leaves only one course open to us , " Todd said . " That is to start gathering evidence to see whether there is a . . . an operation , or whether there is n't . " " That 'd be my idea , " Girard said . " Then somebody has got to go down to El Paso and see for himself , " said Todd , obviously glad to be back on firm120 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYfactual ground . " We ca n't phone . We ca n't ask people . Somebody'sgot to go . " He looked around the room . " I 'm the one , " Clark offered . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't look like a senator , maybe , but if I get in a jam I can always show my card and claim I 'm making an investigation for the committee . It would be natural enough , too , with the recess . " " I guess Ray 's right , " Lyman said . " But , Ray , I want you back right away . See if you ca n't get down there tonight or first thing tomorrow , and make it a one-day job . At least be sure you 're back here by Thursday night . And keep in touch with Esther . " " Right . " Clark stretched , as though his job was already finished . He glanced at the bar . " You 'd better have Henderson 's phone number , Senator , " Casey said , pulling out his little address hook . " And I can brief you on Mutt and his wife after we get through here . " " Okay , " said Clark . " And the name 's Ray . " " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in your roundup of new stuff since Casey 's trip here last night . As I get it , Esther claims Scott has a girl friend in New York . There might be something there . " " You 're right , " Todd said . " It does n't bear directly on this thing , but it ought to he investigated right away . Besides , someone has to go to New York to get a better line on MacPherson . If there is a plot , he may be in on it , although I must say that seems unlikely . What possible use could he be to them ? " " That 's easy , " Girard shot back . " He could be their mouthpiece , the one who tells the country it has a new boss . " " That does not impress me , " Todd said , fingering his watch chain . His eyebrows arched in disdain . " I must say all that mumbo-jumbo about some master television switch leaves me unimpressed , too . " Casey , his voice low-keyed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Mr. Secretary , but that happens to be something I know a good deal about . If this is what we think , and they have the use of that master override control , the President could be prevented from speaking to the country for hours  --  even if he were otherwise free to do so . The way it 's set up , you 'd never have a chance . " " What 's that girl 's name again ? " asked Corwin . " Segnier , " said Todd , consulting his pad . " S-e-g-n-i-e-r , Millicent Segnier . According to Miss Townsend , she is fashion editor of a magazine called Cherie . " " That 's right , " said Casey . " I met her once . " Todd looked at Casey in surprise . Lyman tapped the Marine 's shoulder as he walked behind him to return to his chair . " Well , well , " he said . " I saw nothing in your service jacket to indicate any special proficiency with the ladies , Colonel . " Casey blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " he said , " I know a girl in New York who knows her . Or maybe I ought to say I knew a girl in New York who knew her when I knew the girl in New York . " He stopped abruptly , confused by his own words . Clark 's booming laugh keynoted a general outburst of mirth at Casey 's expense . " Maybe you 'd better start over , Colonel , " said Todd . Now Casey laughed too , but his words came with an effort . " We do n't discuss this in the Casey household any more , " he said . " But two years ago , before my assignment to the Joint Staff , I ran the Marine security detail for two weeks that time Feemerov came to the UN . " " And ? " Todd prompted him . " And since the New York police were really running the security show , I had quite a bit of free time on my hands . I met a girl who was a television script writer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Segnier at a party . " " Have you kept in touch with this television female ? " Todd asked 122 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " No , sir . " Casey was emphatic , then blushed again as Girard chuckled wickedly . " Well , that is , I have n't seen her , but I know she 's still in the TV game up there . " " That seems to solve the problem of who goes to New York , " commented Todd . " Oh , please . " Casey recoiled almost visibly at the thought . " Mrs. Casey would n't understand a secret mission to New York , not at all . She really would n't . " Todd insisted . " You know this woman  --  the General 's woman  --  and you also know somebody who is in the televisionbusiness and therefore can easily provide some information on MacPherson . There is n't time to start from scratch on this . " The President intervened , too . " Look , Jiggs , we do n't have much choice . Chris has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner in this house for more reasonsthan one . Art 's job , and it 's one that only he can handle , is to follow Scott . Ray is going to El Paso and I 've already picked out a chore for Paul . That leaves you . " " What can I tell Marge , sir ? " Casey asked . " Nothing , " said Todd . " But if the domestic pressure gets too strong , perhaps the President could call Mrs. Casey . " " I 'd be delighted , " said Lyman . " Lord . " Casey was dejected . " If it was any place but New York . " " Do n't you wish you 'd stayed on Scott 's side ? " gibed Clark . " We do n't need the name of your friend , " Lyman said , " but you 'd better leave her phone number with Esther . " Todd returned to his scratch pad and went down his list of items , point by point . Each called for some discussion . SenatorPrentice 's name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long inspection of his character . Consensus : While it appeared incredible that Prentice would join a move against a system in which he already held so prominent a place , his campaign contributors included many big defense contractors , he had complete confidence in the military  --  and he openly doubted the Lyman administration 's ability to survive if the123 / TUESDAY AFTERNOONRussians cheated on the nuclear disarmament treaty . Todd saved the Preakness messages until the last . " Aside from ECOMCON , " he said , " this is the one thing that seems to me the most unlikely . I 'm speaking now of Colonel Casey 's interpretation of the agreed facts . " As I see it , these messages can mean three things . First , they may be exactly what they purport to be , a wagering pool . Second , they may be a cover for a proper and prudent military step , to wit , lulling the field commanders before Saturday'salert . Third , the messages may be a coded exchange for a clandestine military operation thus far not revealed to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as a betting man , is n't he ? " " Sure , " said Clark . " We joked about it when he came beforethe committee for confirmation as chairman of the Joint Chiefs last year . Prentice said he guessed it was Scott 's only bad habit . " " I 've seen his picture in the papers plenty of times , at some track or other , " Girard said . " So it could easily be what the messages say it is , " added Todd . " Wait a minute , " Lyman said . " What about his obvious annoyance over Casey 's learning of the messages ? " " Well , " said Todd , " obviously the government 's military radio networks are n't supposed to be used for that kind of thing . So you could n't blame Scott for wanting to keep it quiet . " " The only thing about that , " Casey said , " is that Scott knows I see a lot of his personal traffic , and some of it would cause more rumpus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked the commander of the Almy supply depot at Bordeaux to send him a case of claret . He used all-service radio for that , and Code Blue  --  that 's the chairman 's personalcode . But he never cautioned me about that , or anything else , until yesterday . " " Still , " Todd insisted , " there 's no hard evidence to prove124 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYthese are not messages about a horse race . Now , let 's examine the second possibility . Is he simply duping his field com- manders before an alert ? " Again it was Casey who raised a doubt . " What sticks me there , " he said , " is Admiral Wilson . I ca n't imagine Topping Wilson agreeing to a wager by radio  --  or any other way . Why , he once banned all gambling on a cruiser division he commanded . " " How do you know that ? " asked Todd . " I had the Marine detachment on the flagship , " Casey re- plied . " But the whole fleet knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now that he 's CINCPAC , he 's even tougher . It does n't make sense to me that he 'd do what he told his entire command not to do . " Todd was obstinate . " Still , you have n't proved anything . " Casey reddened , but not from embarrassment this time . " Look , Mr. Secretary , " he began . Lyman cut in fast . " Calm down , Chris . Jiggs is n't trying to prove anything . By the time we collected enough proof to satisfy a court of law , it might well be too late to stop whatever we proved was going on . " Casey relaxed . Todd grunted unhappily but moved ahead . " All right , assuming the worst , " he said , " and these mes- sages are  --  " " Wait a second , " Girard interrupted . " Thinking about the alert again made me wonder about something . Mr. President , who decided which people were going to know about the All Red in advance ? " " Why , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.O.P. with us . " Casey spoke up . " You mean , sir , that you did n't ask General Scott to withhold the information from the Secretary of Defense ? " " No , indeed . I did n't think about it at the time , one way or the other . " " That 's not the point , Mr. President . " Casey was speaking to Lyman , but his words were aimed at Todd . " The General125 / TUESDAY AFTERNOONspecifically told me , when I asked about it , that you had ordered the Secretary blacked out . " Girard moved his heavy frame uneasily in his chair . " There goes the General again , telling another lie . I 'm beginning to feel kind of nervous about our great military leader . " Todd said nothing , but he made another note before going back to his argument . " Assuming the worst , as I started to say , " he said , " and these messages are some kind of private code , when could it have been devised ? Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The General has toured the overseas bases and commandsthree times in fifteen months , " Casey said . " Is that customary ? " asked Todd . " No , it 's some kind of record . Also , every one of those five officers has been in Washington within the last couple of months . " " They all saw Scott , of course ? " " Yes . " " And all but Wilson , " interjected Clark , " appeared before the Armed Services Committee during our general review of the defense situation . " " Still assuming the worst , " Todd said , " that brings us down to the Sixth Fleet commander , Admiral Barnswell , the one who replied no bet . ' Obviously that assumes greater significanceif some kind of plot is afoot , which I do n't believe , and if the messages are a private code , which I 'm not convinced of . " Lyman pushed forward in his chair . " Chris , I 've already decided that the only prudent course is to send Paul over to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plane tonight without being noticed . I 've already talked to Vince about it , and he 's glad to do it . I gave him the idea that Paul has a little confidential personal business abroad . " " Good , " agreed Todd . " Now , does anyone know anything about Barnswell that would help Paul on this ? " " I 've met him , " Clark said , " but I really do n't know much126 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYabout him except that he seems to have a talent for avoiding controversy . He 's a mighty bland witness when he testifies . " " That 's just it , " Casey said . " I thought a lot about that , too , before I called Paul yesterday . You see , Barnswell has quite a reputation around the Pentagon as a , well , a vacillator . He always keeps his nose clean , he never sticks his neck out . He likes to know how the wind 's blowing before he commits him-self . " " A clean nose and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You paint an intriguing portrait , indeed , Colonel . " " I know I do n't express it very well , Mr. Secretary . " Casey was thoroughly irritated at this crusty old lawyer and his snide cracks . " But , frankly , they say Barnswell 's the kind of officer who likes to be with the winner  --  and usually is . " " My God , " Lyman said , " how did a man like that get by the Secretary of the Navy for a key job like the Mediterranean fleet ? " " As a matter of fact , Mr. President , " drawled Clark , " how did Secretary Wallstedt get by you ? " His usual joshing tone was missing . It was obvious to the others that some political nerve of the Georgia senator had been touched . Lyman looked embarrassed . There was a hush in the room as the six men looked at each other , all of them realizing in this moment that the I.ynman administration could never be quite the same again , no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on there would be those who knew and those who could never know , and the line dividing them would respect neither politics nor position . The thought affected each man in the solarium differently , dependingon his degree of intimacy with the President . But whatever that degree , the realization laid a chill upon the room and the darkening mist outside seemed to grow thicker . Todd busied himself wiping his glasses . Lyman finally broke the silence . " I think you 'd better have a letter from me , Paul , just in case . " He went to a little writing127 / TUESDAY AFTERNOONdesk in the corner and pulled out a sheet of stationery bearinga gold presidential seal on the familiar tan paper that Lyman used for his personal notes . He wrote rapidly : Dear Admiral Barnswell : The bearer , Paul Girard , is my appointments secretary and personal associate . I trust that you will extend him every courtesy of your command and will also answer fully and frankly any questionshe may put to you . He is acting for me and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in confidence . Your co-operation will be appreciated . Sincerely , Jordan Lyman " You 'll have to get yourself from Rome to Gibraltar somehow , Paul , " said Lyman , handing him the note after sealing it in an envelope . " And get it in writing , Paul , " Todd warned . " You 're a gentleman , but your word would n't count for much in a court against that of Barnswell or Scott . " The meeting was drawing to a close . Todd looked around the room . " Everybody plan on being back here by Thursday noon at the latest , " he said . " If Casey 's right , we 'd have only forty-eight hours left after that . " " The code , Chris , " Lyman reminded him . The President looked a bit sheepish . " Oh , yes , " Todd said . " If we 're up against the real thing , we 've got to be careful . I 've fixed up a little code for us to use on the phone . " Corwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on all four legs with a little thud . " Mr. Secretary , I do n't think you need to worry about that . Any time you call into the White House , as long as you know the operator and the person you 're talking to  --  and I gather the President has fixed that up through Miss Townsend  --  you do n't need to worry . These lines are as secure as man could make them . " 128 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " Well , what about the phone at the other end ? " Todd asked . " Just stick to public phone booths , " Corwin advised . " Nobodycould tap that many lines . " " Okay , " Lyman said , " I guess it was a little silly . But be careful how you say things , just in case . We 'll get the point even if you talk around it some . " " We 're all a little old to be playing games , " Todd said . " Frankly , I still think the whole thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . " " Ah hope you right , Mistuh Secretary , " said Clark , " but ah kin smell a catfish that 's been layin ' too long in the sun . " As the men filed out , Lyman drew Clark and Girard to one side . He closed the door after Todd , the last of the others to leave . " Those are three fine men , " he said , " hut I 'm not sure we speak the same language . Especially Chris . Hell , he wants me to climb up in the pulpit and shout thief ! ' and search the whole congregation . " " Let 's face it , " said Girard . " They are n't politicians . " " That 's it , Jordie , " Clark said . " Any politician would realizewhy you ca n't move in and clobber this thing right away . My God , with our rating today , we 'd lose hands down in any showdown with Scott . " ' " " And maybe lose the country with it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an excuse to junk that treaty  --  a big brawl in the United States between the military and civilian authorities . I just ca n't figure Chris . It 's funny that he would think we could move openly . " " This one , we play so close to the vest that nobody ever sees the cards . " ( ' lark said . " Exactly , " Lyman said . " I made up my mind last night that if there 's anything to this , we 've got to lick it without the country ever knowing about it . Of course , the only way to do that is to get some evidence that 's solid enough to force Scott to resign  --  on some other pretext . " 129 / TUESDAY AFTERNOON " Now that Chris is in it , " Girard said , " you 're going to have to make him see that , boss . " The three sat for another half hour , going over once again the events of Sunday and Monday . " How about giving him Treatment A ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and if the whole thing does turn out to be a phony , we 'll still be okay . " " Treatment A ? " Lyman was puzzled . " Oh , hell , you know what I mean , chief . " Girard exhibited his wicked grin . " Get him out of town . Send him somewhere  --  out of the country . Scott ca n't grab your job if he 's five thousand miles away . " Clark chuckled . " It must be something about this house . I remember a fellow who worked here in Kennedy 's time  --  he was a college professor , at that  --  telling me the best way to liquidate a man was to keep him out of town . Seriously , Jordie , it might be a good idea . " Lyman shook his head . " No , I do n't think so . It might work if it were almost any other kind of situation . But you ca n't just send the chairman of the Joint Chiefs galloping off on some made-up mission . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Art can keep an eye on him . " It was dark when Clark rose to go . The President shook hands with both men . " Both of you get back here fast , " he said . " I do n't want it to be just one politician against nine generals and admirals  --  or maybe more . " When they had gone , Lyman stood looking out the sweepingwindow . The mist had begun to break now , leaving a low overcast that reflected the glow of the city 's downtown lights . In the end it 's going to be Lyman against Scott , he thought , no matter who else is in it . Somehow he had to get the feel of the man . Sometime , in the not too many hours that were left , he would have to face the General alone . The President stood in the dark . The old-fashioned globes130 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYon the lights along the back driveway cast little halos in the thinning mist that scudded past them . They 're all good men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own in the end . God , what a lonely house . If only Doris were here . It would be nice to have someone to eat dinner with tonight . Tuesday NightArt Corwin parked in an apartment driveway across from the main gate of Fort Myer . He picked his spot carefully . The car rested on an incline that sloped down to the highway . A good four feet separated it from the automobile in front , so he could swing clear with one turn of his steering wheel . He was facing an intersection on Route 50 , so he could either cut across the divided highway and turn left , toward Washington , or turn right into the outbound lane leading to the Virginia countryside . The rain had stopped and the mist had lifted , though a low overcast still hid the moon . The wet streets and dripping foliage were dark and soggy , but the weather failed to confine Corwin 's spirits . He was alert and cheerful . A beer and a corned-beef-on-rye had tasted just right after the long White House meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better than a hundred miles an hour if necessary . And he was working alone again , back to the feeling of his early days in the Secret Service when the only worry was the next move of some small-time counterfeiter , not the hour-by-hour tensionof protecting the President of the United States. 131132 / SE JEN DAYS IN MAYCorwin had driven slowly past Quarters Six , on the hill insidethe old Army post , soon after seven . Both the official limousine of the chairman and Scott 's own big Chrysler stood parked in the driveway . Then Corwin chose this spot , across from the Fort Myer entrance , so he could watch all traffic going in and out of the post . He reparked twice to get just the right line of sight on the gate . Now the street light would illuminate the features of anyone who stopped at the guard hut for the routine nighttime check . This is a strange business , he thought . Whether Scott had designs on the office of the President he did n't know , but it occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin a defensive operation . Corwin had taught himselfalways to assume the worst . Did Scott want the Presidency ? Well , did n't almost everybody in this town ? He began to estimate how many men he should add to the White House detail later in the week . One thing he would do if he were running this jerry-built show would be to plant a man in the all-service radio room in the Pentagon . It would be tricky , but . . . He wondered if Todd had thought of that . He wondered , in fact , whether Todd 's personal reservations about the possibility of a military operation had n't blinded the Secretary to essential precautions that ought to be taken . Suppose , for instance , Scott moved up the date . What would we do then ? Corwin was deep in the problems of shielding the President when a dark-blue seven-passenger Chrysler slid out of the fort gate into the glare of the street light . The M.P . on duty at the entrance snapped off a salute . At the wheel sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore no cap . Corwin caught the unmistakable full crop of black hair , sprinkled with white and gray . There was one man beside him  --  General Billy Riley , the Marine commandant . No other jaw around Washington looked quite like that one . As the Chrysler wheeled onto Route 50 , heading away from Washington , Corwin switched on his parking lights , started his motor and rolled down the hill to the intersection . He let133 / TUESDAY NIGHTthree cars get between him and Scott before he switched on his headlights and pulled out into the traffic . The highway , three lanes wide , rolled out away from the capital . His tires sang on the wet pavement . Corwin liked this . He fixed his eyes on the top of the Chrysler , letting his peripheral vision take care of the normal problems of the evening traffic . He began to hum a song he 'd heard at his first Gridiron Club dinner in Washington , a parody to the tune of " Alice Blue Gown " : ... I remember the atom blew down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly on the accelerator , as the speed limit increased , to keep his distance behind Scott . With plenty of other cars on the road , it was easy . Where was the General heading ? In the jungle of neon lights and access roads at Seven Corners , Corwin saw Scott bear right onto Route 7 , the main road to Leesburg . The two cars moved slowly through Falls Church before the traffic began to thin out and speed up . Corwindropped farther back . He noted that Scott scrupulously observed the speed limit , holding steady at 55 . As they neared Leesburg , the overcast began to break apart . Corwin caught the outline of a cloud and could pick out one star peeping over its rim . The night began to freshen ; he rolled down his window to enjoy the country air . At the fork west of Leesburg , Scott bore right on Route 9 , heading toward Charles Town . Now , what gives there , General ? wondered Corwin . The night races at Shenandoah Downs ? Tailing became harder work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corwin found it difficult to keep more than one automobile between himself and the big Chrysler . With the valleys , hills and turns , he had to stay fairly close . Once or twice he turned out his lights completely , rushed forward at 70 , then switched on the headlights again . If Scott was monitoring his rear-view mirror  --  which he doubted  --  he would think another car had come onto the road behind him. 134 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYThey began to climb toward the Blue Ridge , the eastern rim of the Shenandoah Valley . The pursuit became a trial on the roller-coaster dips and twists of the road . Once Corwin turned off onto a gravel road , then made a hurried grinding U-turn to get back onto Route 9 . Scott 's car was disappearing , its taillightswinking as he braked around a curve . Luckily , Corwin was able to get behind a second car that had come along . He looked at his watch : 9:15 . The two generals had been on the road for an hour and twenty minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridge before dropping into the valley , the left turn indicator of Scott 's car blinked on . Corwin slowed to a crawl . Scott turned left . Corwin followed him onto a black macadam road that ran straight south along the spine of the ridge . He could see Scott 's taillights bobbing up and down about half a mile up the road . So that 's it , he thought . Because of his White House job , Corwin knew something about this road that few other Americansdid . Virginia 120 appeared to be nothing more than a somewhat better-than-average Blue Ridge byway , but it ran past Mount Thunder , where an underground installation providedone of the several bases from which the President could run the nation in the event of a nuclear attack on Washington . Corwin had come this way at least a dozen times before and knew the road . It was just as well , for some of the rises were so abrupt that it would otherwise be difficult to follow at night . Great trees stood along either side of the paved strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corwin 's headlights picked up two glowing dots besidethe road as a rabbit scuttled away to safety behind the rocks . Assuming that Scott was headed for the Mount Thunder station , a few miles farther on , Corwin turned off his headlights again . God , it 's dark , he thought . This is getting a little sticky . Suddenly he saw Scott 's brake lights flash ahead . Corwin stopped . Scott turned sharply and slowly to the left and vanished in the trees . Corwin , using his parking lights , drove on at little more than a walking pace until he reached a point about135 / TUESDAY NIGHTa hundred yards short of where Scott had turned . He found a wide spot on the shoulder and turned his car completely around , parking on the shoulder with his sedan facing back toward the highway . He tried a start . The ground was too muddy ; the wheels spun a bit . He inched the car forward until he found firmer footing in a patch of gravel . Satisfied , he turned off the engine , emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leather key case , with the ignition key outside , into the empty pocket . You never know , he thought , when you might have to leave in a hurry . He dropped the handful of coins into the glove compartment , pulled out his little flashlight and felt in his coat pocket for notebook and pencil . ' Corwin walked along the paved road to the place where Scott had left it . A narrow , unpaved drive cut east , down the side of the ridge , through a thick mixed stand of tulip trees , pine and sumac . On a little marker beside the fence corner Corwin , using his flashlight , could make out the word " Gar-lock . " More of tile same , he thought . This little road must lead down to General Garlock 's house . Brigadier General Matthew H. Garlock was the Mount Thunder station commander . Corwin had met him several times . If there 's a conference , he thought , I better get down there . The gravel road dropped steeply down the slope in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pad of pine needles , stumbling occasionally on a rock thrown out from the roadbed . He knew the overcast had dispersed overhead , but the woods here were so thick that no light at all penetrated . The heavy moisture from the day 's rain and mist clung to trees and ground , wetting his face whenever he brushed a branch but muffling his footsteps . In about a quarter of a mile the road took a final turn and came out into a clearing . Corwin stopped , caught for a moment by the beauty below him . Set back into the side of the mountain stood a low , ramblinglog house . Beyond the house the ridge fell away to a far valley . Hundreds of scattered lights shone up through the night haze that drifted across the lowlands . The sky was clear now , 136 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYthe stars crowding one another across the wide arc of the night , brighter by far than they ever seemed in the city . The moon , pale and hesitant , hung in the east like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights in the valley , Corwindecided , must be Middleburg : the smaller one , to the right , would be Upperville . In the distance , dim in the haze , lay the glow of Warrenton . Nice duty for General Garlock , he thought , living up here where he can look down on the Virginia horse country . Corwin inspected the house . To the right , in the kitchen , he could see a woman bending over the sink . The middle of the house , apparently several rooms wide , was dark , but on the left , in a big room with a fireplace , Corwin could see Scott and Riley sitting on a settee , facing him . When Scott flourished a cigar , a third man got out of a chair to light it for him , and Corwin saw that he was Garlock . The Secret Service agent walked , crouching low , across the lawn , and lowered himself over the edge of a terrace  --  right into a rosebush . He cursed silently as he sucked the scratches left on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he circled to his right , in the shadow of the darkened central rooms , tiptoed carefully across the gravel driveway , and took up a position below the lighted windows . Ile could hear plainly and he knew the three voices , but he was so low that all he could see was the heavy wooden beam in the center of the room 's ceiling . He dropped to one knee and used the other to support his notebook . It was awkward to hold both notebook and flashlight in one hand while he took notes with the other , but it seemed the only way . Scott was speaking . " . . . Appreciate your letting us come out at night , General . It 's about the only time all week that I 'll be free , and I wanted to firm up the details . And after our troubles with the last one , I want to check things myself . " " That 's perfectly all right , sir . " Garlock was being properly respectful , although he sounded puzzled . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be anything special for this alert ? " " Well , the President is coming up to take a look this time , " Scott said . " So we decided it might be a good idea to lay on some extra troops . " " Oh . " Garlock was surprised . " We 've never done that be- fore . " Riley chimed in . " Well , you know , we thought we might put on a little something extra for him . He was n't very happy about the last All Red . " " And a little extra security , too , with the President here , " Scott said . " Accommodations for about two hundred men would do it . You would n't have to worry about feeding them . They 'll carry full field rations for a couple of days as part of the maneuver . After all , they 'll be under full security and wo n't know where they 're headed when they start out . " " Oh , messing the men would be no problem , " Garlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do n't know about the bunks . We 're in pretty close quarters down there , General . " " Why ca n't some of them bivouac aboveground ? " asked Riley . " Most of them would be up there anyway , on a per- imeter , in case of the real thing . " " Well , " said Garlock , " if they 're coming in early , I 'm afraid it might break security on the alert . A lot of people drive along that ridge road and some of them are service people who keep their eyes open . " " Well , how about lower down on the hill , behind some of those old buildings ? " suggested Riley . " That might do it , " Garlock agreed . " By the way , when does the President arrive ? " " About noon Saturday , " Scott said . " Of course , the five chiefs will be here by 11:15 . If you 're worried about any loose ends concerning the President , I can help you wrap them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extra security guard is the only problem , " said the local commander . " I had n't realized you planned anything like that . We have almost a hundred men on permanent security detail here , you know . " Corwin thought Garlock sounded a bit miffed , as though the138 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYvisiting generals were implying some laxity on his part . Scott apparently had the same reaction . " Do n't take this as any criticism of your command , General , " Scott said . " It 's just that we 've got to learn to move security forces around this country much faster than we have . The last alert showed that clearly . " " If that 's what the President wants , " said Garlock , " well , of course , I have no objection . " There was silence for a moment and Corwin could imagine Scott 's gaze following the smoke from his cigar . When Scott spoke , his voice dropped a tone . " Actually , this is being done independently of the President , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty unhappy with our performance last time , and we want to show him  --  " Corwin had stood up to rest his cramped knee and in doing so had brushed against a euonymus bush . A branch , pushed back by his shoulder , was released when he moved again and swung against the side of the house with a wet slap . In the kitchen , a dog growled . The woman said , " Want to go out , Lady ? " Corwin jumped across the gravel driveway and ran up the sloping yard . He threw himself flat on the lawn and squirmed around to peer at the house under a large boxwood which flanked the roses lining the terrace . The kitchen door banged and a shiny black Labrador hustled along the drive to sniff at the shrubbery where Corwin had been . " Let 's go out , " said Garlock , opening a door from the room where the three officers had been talking . " We 'll have some fun if it 's another one of those deer . " Corwin saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He crawled across the yard , reaching the edge of the woods just as Garlock , followed by Scott and Riley , came out of the house . Garlock swept the light around in a narrow circle , beginning at the barn and continuing along the terrace where Corwin had been only a moment before . Corwin , now flatteninghis broad-shouldered frame behind a log , could feel the wet moss soaking his shirt. 139 / TUESDAY NIGHTThe three men walked along the driveway as Garlock probed the yard with his flashlight . The dog sniffed along Corwin'strail up to the terrace , but apparently lost the scent on the flagstones , for he began to run back and forth , barking unhappily . " A deer 's a beautiful sight , " Garlock said , " when you catch him in the light . Those eyes look like two hot coals . " He turned back to the house , but Riley took the flashlight from him , and with Scott moved up toward the woods . Garlockstayed near the house , and the dog stayed with him . Riley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Riley say : " It might have been an animal , Jim , but I had a funny feeling coming out here tonight . " " I do n't think you need to worry , " said Scott . " I stood a pretty good watch on that rear-view mirror . I do n't think anyone was following us . " Scott and Riley gave up the hunt a few seconds later and rejoined Garlock at the house . They went back to the living room , and the woman in the kitchen called Lady back in . Not until the kitchen door banged shut did Corwin move . When he did , he felt as if he were rolling in an old sleeping bag that had been left out in a downpour . Hardly a patch of clothing was dry . Regaining the gravel road , he broke into a run , and by the time he reached his car he was puffing hard . My God , he thought , I must be mud and slop all over from shoes to collar . Mr. President , if you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diem for this joyride , plus ten cents a mile for the car , plus a good dry-cleaning bill , you 're crazy . Then Corwin remembered that it would be the Secret Service , not the President , to whom the expense account would have to go . Working for the government , he thought , you ca n't win . Corwin drove back about half a mile along the macadam road until he came to a slight bend . He parked a few yards beyond it , calculating that from here he could see Scott 's headlightswhen he came out of Garlock 's road . It seemed unlikely140 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYthat Scott would turn south , for that was the long way around for the return trip to Washington . Garlock might take them that way to Mount Thunder , of course , but Corwin decided that from his position he could go either way without being spotted . He wished he had a cigarette now . He had quit smokingfive years ago , but now could recall exactly how good that first big drag on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeout on some counterfeiting gang . He did n't have long to wait . Lights swept out from Garlock 's road , hesitated , and then came north toward him . He gunned his car over a small hill in the dark . Then he switched his lights on and sped for Route 9 , turned toward Washington and drove  --  too fast  --  down the winding road which fell off the Blue Ridge . At the bottom , Corwin swung into a dirt road , turned his car around and waited again in the dark . A few minutes later the big Chrysler rolled past , Riley in the front seat with Scott . Corwin picked up the shadow , but much farther back this time . The ride home seemed to go more quickly . The night was clear now , as the last black cloud moved away to the east . The road had dried and a breeze had come up . The taillights of Scott 's car had assumed an identity of their own for Corwin , and he kept his eyes on them . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . This will be harder , Corwin thought , he 's taking the back road to Chain Bridge . That means he is n't going back to Fort Myer . And he is n't driving Riley home to the Marine Barracks in Southeast Washington , either . He must be heading for some place in Northwest Washington or Maryland . The road dodged and bent through the trees . Corwin had to stop several times to avoid getting too close to Scott . Not until the General crossed the Potomac on Chain Bridge did Corwin feel easier . Tailing in city traffic was a cinch ; he dropped back four or five cars . Scott drove across to MassachusettsAvenue and turned toward the heart of the city . Corwin followed him through two traffic circles before the chairman turned off into a side street that led to the rear of a huge new141 / TUESDAY NIGHTapartment building . When Scott drove into the hack parking lot , Corwin parked on the street nearby . He saw Scott and Riley walk past a lighted sign ( " ' I lie I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underground gar age . From his angle , he could see only their legs and feet as they crossed the room and turned into a side corridor . Ile waited until they had time to get into an elevator , then followed them . The hallway dead-ended at the freight elevator . Well now , he thought , that 's a strange way for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs to go calling . Corwin went back to his car , drove into the hack lot and parked about a dozen places away from Scott 's automobile ( ) n a hunch , he fished into his glove compartment and got out the pocket-sized Congressional Directory he always carried . I le looked up Prentice , Frederick , Senator from California . Sure enough . Residence : The Dobney . A few minutes later a yellow taxicab drove up and parked . Corwin recognized it as belonging to the fleet which had the concession at Dulles International Airport . He also recognized the passenger who got out . He was tall , angular , and walked with a slight forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit with a high sheen  --  the kind Corwin called an " electric suit . " Well , I 've done my homework pretty well , he thought . After his talk with the President that morning , Corwin had done two things before picking up Scott . He had arranged to get Casey 's service record , and he had studied the picture of every man mentioned by President Lyman . He had n't had to hunt for a likeness of the man who had just got out of the cab , because he had obtained a photograph of him at Lyman 's request a week ago . He was sure he was right ; the man now walking toward the back entrance of the Dobney was the television commentator , Harold MacPherson . Corwin got out of his car and strolled toward the garage . He saw MacPherson turn left and go down the hallway toward the freight elevator . It was more than an hour later  --  almost 1 A.M.  --  when Scott142 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYand Riley , this time accompanied by MacPherson , reappeared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MacPherson going back to the taxi . Corwin decided to fudge a bit on the President 's orders and follow the cab . The quarry was newer  --  and thus vastly more interesting . Frankly , Corwin thought , I 've had about enough of Gentleman Jim for one night . The new venture , however , proved fruitless . The taxi drove out to Dulles International , as Corwin had suspected it would . He followed MacPherson into the lobby , after brushing the worst of the mud from his shirt and pants , and watched the commentator check in at Eastern Airlines , buy a magazine and stroll down a ramp . Corwin watched him climb onto Flight 348 , a night coach to New York . The Secret Service agent went to a phone booth and called Esther Townsend at the White House . It was 1:55 A.M. " This is Art , " he said . " I 've got a report . It 's pretty inter-esting . " " Can it wait until morning ? " asked Esther sleepily . " Early morning , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How about seven o'clock , upstairs ? " " That 's okay . I 'll be there . " " I think that 's better , " Esther explained . " He did n't get to bed until an hour ago and this may be the last night in some time when he 'll get a decent rest . " " I 'm afraid that goes for all three of us , honey , " Corwin said . " I 'll be at home . " Flight 348 was lifting off the runway when Corwin drove past the last hanger . God , I 'm tired , he thought . And scummy . I smell like a muskrat . He tramped hard on the accelerator . He began to hum wearily : ... I remember the atom blew down All the foreign relations in town . WednesdayMorningThe night sky began to lighten in the east as Jiggs Casey and Senator Raymond Clark rode through the Virginia countryside . President Lyman 's agents were about their business ; Casey and Clark were headed for Dulles Airport , which Art Corwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on their way well before sunrise , they w e not the first of the President 's little force to start work . About the time Corwin reached home , with the red-clay mud of the Blue Ridge still clinging to his shirt , Paul Girard had flown out over the Atlantic in the after cabin of the big jet transport carrying Vice-President Vincent Gianelli to Rome . By prearrangement with Casey , Senator Clark was driving his own car to the airport . The two men wanted to be able to talk without worrying about an eavesdropping driver . Clark had beeped gently in front of Casey 's Arlington home just after 4 A.M. The colonel , waiting on his front stoop in the dark , climbed into the convertible with the red leather bucket seats143144 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYand threw his thin dispatch case in the back . He was bound for New York , Clark for El Paso . " Pretty fancy locomotion , Senator , " said Casey . " Jiggs , if you do n't start calling me Ray , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , Ray . " Casey liked this friendly politician from Georgia . " But it 's still a pretty snappy rig . " " Just a widower 's consolation , Jiggs . We got to have some fun in life . And what did your wife say about this junket ? " " If you think it 's easy to leave home without any explanation , you 're crazy , " Casey said unhappily . " I could n't say it was a secret mission because Scott might call . I could n't say the President sent me . I could n't say it was duty . Damn it , I could n't say anything . I just had to stand there and watch those big brown eyes turn green . " " Come off it , Jiggs , " Clark said in a mocking tone . " Do n't tell me Mrs. Casey has any reason to he suspicious of you . " The merging Virginia suburbs flew past . My God , this guy drives fast , Casey thought . The telephone poles raced by like pickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she does n't , no . But if she thought I was going to New York , she would he anyway . " " The gal who works for television ? " " That 's right . " " What was that all about , anyway ? " asked Clark . " You sounded pretty vague yesterday . " " It was a couple of years ago and it was all over almost before it started . " Casey offered nothing more . " I 'm beginning to get a little suspicious myself , Jiggs . " Clark 's tone was bantering . " Look , " said Casey defensively , " the only reason I know this Segnier ( lame is because of one weekend in New York two years ago when I was on the UN detail . She 's a friend of the girl I met . We ... well , it was short and it was one of those things . Marge got some word of it somehow and there was hell to pay . And there should have been , I guess . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 145 / WEDNESDAY MORNING " Yeah , I know , " Clark said . " Do n't start kicking yourself around all over again . " " It is n't that . It 's just that the President is almost forcing me back into something that was dead and buried . I mean , the only way I can find out anything about Scott and Millicent Segnier is through Shoo . " " Shoo ? " " Shoo Holbrook . Eleanor Holbrook . You might as well know . You might have to rescue me up there . She writes scripts for TV shows . " Clark drove a moment in silence . " Well , take it easy , Jiggs , " he said . " A good wife is worth an awful lot . " " I know . " " Worth more than anything , " said Clark , suddenly serious , " except a country . " " What do you really think about my story ? " Clark was obviouslythe President 's best friend , and Casey was frankly curiousabout his reaction . Clark took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think it 's the most harebrained , farfetched yarn I ever heard . " He paused . " And I think it 's probably true . " " You do ? " " Well , maybe not all the lurid details that your surmises would add up to . That 's what we 're trying to find out . But the climate 's right for something like this , Jiggs , just as the Presidentsaid yesterday . I 've felt it in my stomach for a long time . " You know , Girard and I stayed behind with the President last night . He needed us . After all , we were the only two politiciansin the room besides him . You and Art and Todd are great guys to have in a thing like this , but it takes a professional to kind of weigh what 's possible and what is n't . " " What do you think he can do , the President ? " Casey asked . " I take it he wo n't consider a public showdown . " " That 's impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all and his friends would hint that the President had had a mental breakdown  --  or worse . They might call him146 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY 147 / WEDNESDAY MORNINGinsane . He could be impeached , but even if he was n't , the real power would pass to Scott , and from then on civilian authority would n't be worth a nickel . " " So ? " " So the President gets open-and-shut evidence in his hands and then ... " Clark stopped . Casey looked at him . The Georgian'sface had gone hard . " . . . And then he breaks him fast . Forces him to resign . Anything goes at that point . " Casey lit a cigarette . Clark must have been a pretty tough one himself in combat , for all his easy surface manner . " And what if he ca n't make the evidence stick ? " he asked . " I 've thought some about that , " Clark said , " but I do n't think the President has . He 's too confident that point will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a dream . One way , of course , would be to fire Scott out of hand without warning , install some guy like Rutkowski as chairman , call off the alert and order Rutkowski to break up ECOMCON  --  if it 's really there . " " You 'd have to do that by Friday night , " Casey pointed out , " before they start flying troops all over the country . " " I know , I know . But does Jordie . . . does the President know ? Jiggs , before we 're out of this we may need some professionaladvice from you . We might reach the point where we 'd need to know the exact place to cut the communications and the command chain , so that it belongs to us , not to Scott . " They fell silent . Casey felt small and a bit helpless in the half-light just before sunrise . Six men fumbling with a huge military machine  --  and no manual to guide them . The great apparatus of the Pentagon stood there , ready to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guns , ships , planes , missiles . Casey felt as if he 'd lost his bearings . Where were the powers of the Presidency , about which he 'd heard all his life and for which he himself had jumped on occasion ? " In our system , " Clark said , as though reading his thoughts , " a politician without the people is n't much , no matter where he sits . " As they drove into the airport parking lot , Casey copied Mutt Henderson 's El Paso phone number out of his address book onto a slip of paper and gave it to Clark . " Thanks , Jiggs , " Clark said , " but I think I better have a look at that base myself . If I do n't , we wo n't be any better off than we are now . " The two men shook hands and parted in the terminal lobby . The sun glowed large and red on the horizon when Casey boarded his shuttle plane to New York . A few minutes later , in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning jet flight to Dallas and El Paso . President Lyman 's first order of business this morning was an 8:30 call to his wife Doris at their daughter 's home in Louisville . Lyman knew that a soft word would keep Doris happy for hours , and he thought wryly that he should be grateful for at least one situation in which a mere expression of approval on his part sufficed to put things right . After chatting with Mrs. Lyman , he called Liz at the hospital , heard her whisper " Grandpa " for the first time and blew her a loud kiss over the phone . His mood was so cheerful when Secretary Todd telephoned a few minutes later that it earned him a rebuke . " Good God , Mr. President , " Todd said . " The way you sound , Scott must have given up and died . " " No . As a matter of fact , I was just about to call you about that . Can you come over right away ? " By the time Todd arrived from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning papers , informed his protesting press secretary that there would be no formal appointmentsthat day , checked with Esther Townsend to make sure his three emissaries were safely on their way , and finished reading Corwin 's notes on his night with Scott . Todd fingered his watch chain as he read through the Corwinreport , handed to him without comment by the President . Lyman removed his glasses , held them lightly in his big hands , and studied them as though inspecting the lenses for flaws. 148 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAY " I must say that nothing in here tends to undercut Colonel Casey 's story , " Todd said . " Imagine two grown men sneaking up a freight elevator in the middle of the night to meet with a fringe mental case like MacPherson . " " Incidentally , " Lyman said , " we can be pretty sure that it was Prentice 's apartment . Esther checked our phone list this morning and Prentice is the only member of Congress of any standing who lives at the Dobney . " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Todd said . " After all , he 's chairman of the Armed Services Committee , even if it was a bit late to call on him . But I ca n't see him mixing with that MacPherson . " Lyman leaned across his desk . " Look , Chris , if there is something up along the lines Casey suggested , it makes pretty good sense to me . MacPherson has eight or ten million listeners in his audience every night , and they apparently take everything he says as gospel truth . If Scott is planning something , he 'll need someone to sell it to the country . And the way MacPhersontalks , he 'd be willing to do it . What I ca n't figure out is Prentice 's part in this . " Now it was Todd 's turn to he slightly patronizing . " Mr. President , if there 's something going on  --  and I 'm still not ready to admit there is --  -- it 's quite obvious to me why Senator Prentice might he involved . Ile has a vested interest in the military not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents . Think of all the defense contractsin California . Almost all our missiles and planes are made there . And it 's not just big industry , it 's the unions too . You turn on disarmament full steam and there 'd be ghost towns all around Los Angeles for a while . " " Prentice is a bigger man than that , " Lyman protested . " He throws his weight around , and he fought me on the treaty . But I 've always respected him , really . " " I think it could he reflex action , pure and simple . He 's no deep thinker . That treaty is a threat to his way of life , that 's all . " Todd brought the conversation back to specifics . " What about Rutkowski ? " 149 / WEDNESDAY MORNING " We talked for about an hour last night , " Lyman said . " I found it a little hard to keep my hand hidden . I put it pretty much on the basis of being worried about what the military commanders were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barney agreed to sound out Admiral Palmer this morning . " " Did he  --  " The President interrupted . " Yes , there 's something else . Barney said he got a call about three weeks ago from Colonel Murdock , asking him to come to Washington for a talk with Scott . Murdock made it plain it was n't an order , just an invitation to discuss the political situation . Barney told him politics was n't in his line , but that he 'd drop in next time he came here . Murdock got kind of vague then and said Yes , do that , ' or something like that . " " I do n't think Rutkowski should drop in ' on Scott now , " Todd said . " Scott might suspect something . " " I agree , " Lyman said . " But I think I ought to call Scott right now , and tell him I 'm going to skip the alert and go to Maine for the weekend instead . " Todd nodded . " We want to try him out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner the better . " The President buzzed for Esther . " I have a sneaky job for you , dear , " he said . " I want you to get General Scott on the line for me , and then take down the conversation . " Todd stared intently at the President throughout the telephoneconversation . Occasionally Lyman nodded at him with a humorless smile . When he hung up , five minutes later , his early-morning buoyancy was gone . Todd started to ask something , but Lyman cut him off with a wave of his hand and buzzed for Esther . " Come in and read it back to us , Esther . " She came in with her shorthand book , sat down , and read : THE PRESIDENT : Good morning , General . This is Jordan Lyman. ' 11Af4150 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYGENERAL SCOTT : Good morning , Mr. President . I see we 're both early birds today . PRESIDENT : General , to come right to the point , I 've been thinking it over and I 'm not going to participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired out . I 've decided to go up to my place at Blue Lake and fish for two or three days . SCOTT : Mr. President , if I may take exception , sir , you really ca n't do that . You 're an integral part of the exercise . Your presenceis necessary . In fact , vital . PRESIDENT : I 'm only the last peg on the board , General . You know that . The alert can go through without me . SCOTT : But you happen to be the Commander in Chief , sir . Certain orders can only be given by you . PRESIDENT : But those are final orders , and will only be simulatedon Saturday anyway . SCOTT : It 's really more than that , Mr. President . Your presence is needed for morale , for the Chiefs and especially for the field commands who 'll realize you 're watching everything . PRESIDENT : Do n't worry about that . I 'll be following things closely at Blue Lake . SCOTT : If I may say so , sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation at this stage in our situation with Russia . They wo n't be very much impressed by an alert which takes place while you go fishing . PRESIDENT : Suppose you let me he the judge of that , General . I 'm afraid my decision is final . I just have to get some time off . SCOTT : Of course it is up to you , Mr. President , but I must say I ca n't endorse your decision . PRESIDENT : Well , I . . . SCOTT : When do you expect to go to Blue Lake ? PRESIDENT : I 'm probably going to fly up Friday afternoon , late . SCOTT : Well , I envy you . Good luck with the fish . PRESIDENT : Good-by , General . SCOTT : Good-by , Mr. President . Todd waited until the flush of anger faded from Lyman 's face . " Not an easy man to cross , " Todd remarked . " I 'm glad he 's on our side and not the Soviets ' . " " Our side , Chris ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I must admit my doubts are growing , " Todd said . " You151 / WEDNESDAY MORNINGcertainly drew a reaction from him . Now , what are you going to do about it ? " " I 'm going to call Hank up at Blue Lake . If Scott 's up to anything , I think he might send someone up there to get a look at it . " It took a minute or two for Esther to get through to Henry Picot , the President 's caretaker and fishing guide at his Maine retreat . " Hank ? This is Jordan Lyman . They are , huh ? How many ? ... You 're a liar , Hank . No , I ca n't come this weekend , but I want you to make it sound as though I am coming . That 's right . Drop the word at the store when you go in to get the mail . " And listen , I expect a few magazine people might turn up there to look the place over . Maybe in the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get pictures . If you see any strangers around the island , be polite to them , but do n't let them on the place . Okay ? And , Hank , get a good look at them and give me a call as soon as they leave , will you ? .. . " No , I 'm not sure they 're coming . It 's just a hunch . . . . No , no . You know I do n't have any enemies  --  except you and those fish . Okay . Thanks , Hank . " Todd nodded approvingly at Lyman . " If this thing is as bad as it 's beginning to look , your man Picot will have visitors before Friday . " " I think so too . " " Look , " Todd said , " I think I ought to go back to the office and work out an alternative plan . Suppose , for example , that we become convinced there 's something up , but we ca n't prove it ? In that case , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you would , Chris , " Lyman said . " Frankly , my thinkinghas n't gone that far . " When Todd left , Lyman went through Corwin 's report again . It read like a two-bit thriller . General Garlock he had met only once , and he could n't really remember him . Obviously , though , Garlock was n't in on Scott 's plans . Lyman felt strangely upset about General Riley . He remembered an up-152 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYroarious evening last year when he had given a party for the top Marine commanders , one in a series of military stag dinnershe put on . Riley had told story after story of World War II days with earthy , trenchant humor . Few men had made so quick or so favorable an impression on Lyman . Could Riley now really have a hand in challenging the system which had given so much to the country , to the Marines  --  and to Riley himself ? And how could men of the stature of Scott and Riley bring themselves to sneak into a freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a transparent charlatan as MacPherson ? Or had he misjudged MacPherson ? Or was Corwindreaming , too ? Esther 's buzzer , announcing General Rutkowski , cut Lyman'sthoughts short . He was thankful , for they were beginning to wander and the schedule would n't allow much of that . General Bernard Rutkowski wore his Air Force uniform and command pilot 's wings like a man born to them . He was stocky , blond , and just a trifle overweight . A bright , tough Chicago slum kid , he had literally forced his way into West Point , harassing three congressmen until one finally appointed him . He wanted to fly . Now he wanted to command fliers and missiles . He had carefully avoided Pentagon duty over the years ; the Air Defense Command was his first completely chairborne assignment and he suffered in it . Lyman waved at a chair and Rutkowski dropped into it , emphatically . The President offered him a cigar from the box he kept for Todd , and within a few seconds Rutkowski was enveloped in blue smoke . " That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Admiral Palmer , " the General said . He blew a hole in his smoke cloud and studied Lyman . " I 'm not much good on this espionage stuff , Mr. President , especially when I 'm still not quite sure what you wanted me to find out . " Lyman retreated to his veiled language of the night before . I hate doing this to you , Barney , he thought , but that 's the way it has to be. 153 / WEDNESDAY MORNING " Really , nothing specific , Barney , " he said . " As I told you , I 've been a bit worried over the attitude of some of the military commanders since we negotiated the disarmament treaty . I had a feeling there might be some organized resistance from some of your colleagues , and you know that would n't be good for the country . " Rutkowski was obviously not satisfied , but he shouldered ahead in his blunt way . " Anyway , " he said , " I told Palmer I had a feeling something was going on here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to get the word . I mentioned that call last winter from Daniel at SAC , and then the one a couple of weeks ago from Murdock . " Palmer fenced awhile , but he is n't much better at it than I am . He likes to get to the point . Finally , he said he felt the same way I did , but he could n't explain it . He said as far back as last Christmas Scott took him to dinner at the Army-Navy Club one night and talked nothing but politics . " " Did Palmer say what his reaction was ? " " Sure . He 's a stand-up guy . He said he did n't like it . He told Scott his job was to run the Navy and help make military strategyin the JCS , and that politics was out of his line . " " Was that the end of it ? " " For about two months . In February Scott had Palmer to dinner over at Quarters Six , with General Riley and General Dieffenbach . This time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , very critical of you and your foreign policy . " " Thought I was making a real mess of things ? " asked Lyman . " Well , yes . " Rutkowski grinned . " I 'm not going to repeat some of the language Palmer used . It got pretty purple . " " Do n't bother to spare me , " Lyman said , smiling . " That 's everyday talk in my business . You should see some of my mail . " " Palmer says he listened but did n't say much , and when the others tried to draw him out , he backed water . That was all for a while , until Palmer denounced the treaty when the Senate154 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYArmed Services Committee questioned him on it . He said Scott must have heard about his statement through the grapevine , because he called him that night to congratulate him . That time again Scott wanted to expand into a general politicaldiscussion of your administration , but Palmer would n't go for it . " " Is that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he got a call from Murdock not too long ago , just about the time I did , inviting him to talk over the political situation and the military responsibility . ' Palmerkind of told him off , I gather . He said he 'd already said his piece on the treaty , that it was your show now and that was that . " Oh , there was one other thing . Palmer thinks the other chiefs have had some meetings on this subject that he has n't been in on . He figures they 're getting ready to back some kind of citizens ' group that will try to get the treaty repealed , or something . He thinks the chiefs will give it all the covert supportthey can without having their names appear . He says he does n't believe in playing that way . " " What do you think of the treaty , Barney ? " asked Lyman . Rutkowski shifted his cigar to the corner of his mouth . " You want it straight , Mr. President ? " " It would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the Russkis are playing you for a sucker . I do n't think they have any intention of disarming . Oh , they might dismantle some bombs all right on July 1 , but how many more will they he stockpiling at some new base in Siberia ? " " You do n't trust our intelligence ? " asked Lyman . " Not on that one , Mr. President . Russia is too big a coun-try . " " But you would n't join some group , say General Scott 's if he has one , to fight the treaty ? " " Nope , " Rutkowski said . " You 've made the decision . You asked our advice . We gave it . You did n't take it . All right , now it 's up to you . God bless you , Mr. President , I hope it works . If it does n't , we start earning our pay the hard way . " 155 / WEDNESDAY MORNINGLyman hoped his smile looked as warm as he felt . " Barney , I wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the way you give it . You do n't straddle  --  like some I know . " " If you 'll pardon the language , Mr. President , " Rutkowski said , " straddling makes my ass tired . So I never got into the habit . " Lyman got up in his angular way and walked around the desk . As they moved toward the door , the President again asked Rutkowski to keep his visit to Palmer and the White House confidential . " If I need you again in Washington , Barney , " Lyman added , " I hope you 'll come down and stay awhile . " " As long as the taxpayers let me have that jet , " the General replied , " I 'm your man in two hours , any time . " When the door closed , Lyman went to the tall window and stood looking out at the rose garden , his hands in his pockets . The sun shone thinly this morning , but even that was a welcomeimprovement over yesterday 's rain . Had there been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , and was Scott merely up to the old military stratagem of quietly sponsoring a civilian organization to say what the generalswere not supposed to say for themselves ? If that 's all it is , Lyman thought , I 'll contribute fifty bucks to the pot and lead three cheers for Scott in Garfinckel 's window . But what about ECOMCON ? Does the chairman need thirty-five hundred trained saboteurs to reinforce public opinion ? Is there an ECOMCON , after all ? Well , on that one , Ray Clark should know in a few hours . When Clark stepped out of his plane at El Paso the heat encased his body . It was still early morning in West Texas , but the sun shone with unfamiliar intensity even from its low angle . Clark ran his tongue around the inside of his mouth , grimacing at the taste . He had slept since Dallas , but after boarding the plane in Washington he had drained the half-pint bottle of bourbon in his pocket in a couple of gulps. 156 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYHis face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubble stood out on his cheeks . Clark was n't sure whether he 'd like a drink or breakfast . He decided he 'd settle for either . A lunch counter appeared first . He ordered juice , doughnuts , and coffee and asked the waitress for the name of a good nearby motel . " Try the Sand ' n ' Saddle , " she said . " But it 's a nice place . Maybe you better shave before you check in , mister . " Clark got the cab driver talking  --  it was n't much of a task  --  on the short ride to the motel . " Say , I 'm looking for an old buddy from down home , " Clark said . " You know all the Army bases around here ? " " Ai n't many , Mac , " the driver replied . " They 's just big . You 're looking for Fort Bliss , maybe ? " " No , that does n't sound like it . " " Well , they got White Sands just a little ways up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the same way . " The driver studied Clark in the rear-view mirror . " Or Biggs field , here . Any of ' em ? " " Nope , " Clark said , " this is a new one . Maybe only a couple months old . Damn , I lost the piece of paper he wrote it down on . " " Well , there 's some kinda new base around here somewhere , one they keep pretty quiet . Tell you the truth , Mac , I do n't know where it is . We never get no business from it and if Uncle Sam do n't want me stickin ' my nose in his business , I do n't stick it in . " " This buddy , " Clark said , " he 's in the Signal Corps . " " You got me , pal . I never heard of that neither . " The Sand ' n ' Saddle sprawled invitingly in a two-story semicirclefrom the office where Clark alighted . Through the open passageways he could see a swimming pool and deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature to a painless 80 degrees . The senator registered simply as " R. Clark , Macon , Georgia . " A Mexican teen-ager with a fixed157 / WEDNESDAY MORNINGsmile and expressionless eyes took Clark 's overnight case and led him to a room on the upper level . A steady current of cool air poured from the gray machine in the window . Clark stooped over and held his face close to the source , massaging his temples and cheekbones . " How soon can you get me a little whisky ? " he asked the bellboy . " Sorry , boss , the package store does n't open until ten , " said the youth . " It 's far from here , too . " " Come on , son . " Clark handed him a $10 bill . " You must have a private stock for your good customers . " The boy disappeared and came back a few minutes later with a pint of blended whisky . Clark winced at the label , but took the bottle without comment . Alone , he wrenched the cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed his smarting eyes . Then , self-consciously resolute , he walked into the bathroom , put the bottle in the medicine cabinet and banged the little door shut . He returned to the bedroom and picked up the telephone . " Call me in an hour , please , " he told the operator . He stripped to his shorts , climbed under a sheet and went to sleep almost at once . When the phone rang an hour later he felt better . He shaved , changed into a short-sleeved shirt and lightweight sports jacket , and then sat on the edge of the bed , gazing at the slip of paper Casey had given him . Finally he made up his mind and asked the operator to get him the number . A woman answered . " Mrs. Henderson ? " " Yes . " " Ma'am , my name is Ray Clark . I 'm a friend of Mutt 's and Jiggs Casey 's . Jiggs gave me your phone number and told me to call when I got to town . I just missed Mutt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Mutt got in late Monday , but he had to go right out to the base . I 'm afraid he 'll be there through the weekend , too . " " Any way I can reach him ? " 158 / SEVEN DAYS IN MAYShe laughed . " If you find out , please tell me . I do n't even know where it is . " " You mean you 've never even seen it ? " Clark pumped his voice full of incredulity . " Well , he did show me the general direction once when we were driving over to White Sands , so at least I know my husband'snot in Alaska . " " Service wives have it rough . " " You 're not in the service ? " Mrs. Henderson 's voice becameguarded . " Oh , sure , " Clark lied . " That 's how I know how it is . Or , rather , my wife does . They keep me traveling all the time on the hardware gadgets . " " Oh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're stopping , and if he does get home , I 'll have him call you . " " Sorry . " He lied again . " I 've got to fly to L.A. this afternoon . Just tell him Ray called . And thanks anyway , Mrs. Henderson . " On his way out the door , Clark hesitated , stepped back toward the bathroom , then turned quickly and went out again , banging the door hard . He walked rapidly down to the office , putting a smile back on his face by the time he reached the desk . He handed his room key to the clerk and asked him to arrange a car rental for him . " Caddy ? " asked the clerk . Clark had n't realized a shave could do that much for a man 's appearance . " No , Chevy or Ford 's okay . " While he waited , Clark leaned on the desk and talked with the thin young man who ran the office . " What road do I take to go to White Sands ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54 . Take a left out front and then keep straight on out . It 's about sixty miles . " " Say , how do I get to that new Army base out that way ? I got a friend in the Signal Corps there . " " Search me . " The young man shrugged his shoulders . " I heard of some base out that way some place , but from what I hear , it 's supposed to be secret . " 159 / WEDNESDAY MORNING " What 's between here and White Sands ? " The youth grinned quickly . " Desert . " Several miles northeast of El Paso , driving at an unaccustomed40 miles per hour , Clark had to agree with the description . To his right , the gray-brown land stretched flat to the far horizon , burnished almost white by the unrelenting sun which now rode well up in the sky . Occasional small boulders , clumps of tumbleweed and scattered barrel cactus offered the only relieffrom the expanse . On Clark 's left rose the Franklin Mountains , gray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes . More than forty million years ago , an ancient agony beneath the earth 's surface had thrown up fire and lava to mold a mighty mountain range . Hundreds of centuriesof wind and sun had eroded the peaks , inch by inch , until the limestone hills stood like old men , gaunt , withered , timeless . Despite the heat , the dryness of the air left Clark feeling better than he thought he had a right to feel . He wiped his brow , but found no perspiration on it ; evaporation had turned him into a self-cooling machine . Just over the New Mexico state line , he swung into a service station . From the look of the empty road ahead , it would be the last for many miles . A man , from his stance of casual authority the proprietor , stood in the doorway . He wore a grease-spotted undershirt and his face was seamed and leathery . " Coke in there ? " Clark asked . The man nodded toward a big red box . Clark dropped in his dime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vending machine . " Have one ? " The man shook his head , but smiled faintly in thanks . " How far is it to White Sands ? " Clark asked . " About fifty . " " You sure got a hot country here , " said Clark , " and I got to make three PX 's out that way today . " " Salesman ? " " Yep . Detergents . But this is a new route for me . " This evoked no comment . Clark went on : " How many miles to **25;3793;TOOLONG McKenna 40 " Arf ! Arf ! Good man , Holman ! " Holman walked back to his locker grinning . After supper he went below again , in clean dungarees , to check some of his sketches . Po-han followed him and he would point to one of Holtman 's sketched crosses and then to a particular valve and ask , " Same ? B'long same ? " Po-han was always wrong , but he knew that there was something very wonderful about those marks on paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips and screwed up his features and he looked about to cry . Holman could read that expressionand he had often known in himself the painful , tantalizing feelingbehind it . Something in Holman answered to the young bilge coolie . He tried to explain , but the pidgin English they shared was not enough . Po-han could not get the idea of breaking down the great mass of piping into separate systems . He could not say what was moving in what direction through any of the pipes that Holman pointed out . He did not even have the idea of stuff moving through pipes . All of Holman 's doubts came back . How could these bilge coolies ever tend machinery ? " Come over here , " he told Po-han . Po-han followed him over to the feed pumps . Holman choked the throttle on the duty pump and dropped the pressure fifty pounds . " You fix , " he told Po-han . Po-han eased open the steam inlet and restored the pressure . The hot well stood just aft of the pumps . Holman knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level drop in the gauge glass with his Chinese eyes as wide and round as he could get them . Just as the water went out of sight , Holman closed the rundown valve . " You fix , " he said . Po-han practically flew to the make-up feed pump and set it clacking . He watched tensely until the water level built up again and then secured the pump . Holman tried him on several other operations and questioned him on them all . Po-han knew what to do , but he did41 The Sand Pebblesnot know what it was that he did . He knew in a vague way that steam and water moved through pumps and valves , but when he twisted a valve he did not realize that he was opening or closing it . To Po-han , all that he did was isolated little magics that moved a pressure gauge pointer or a water level back to the right place . What he had glimpsed in Holman 's sketches , what his eager , wistful eyes were reaching out for , was the big magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little magics . Well , some navy engineers he had known were not much better off than Po-han , Holman thought . He decided to try to show Po-han the steam cycle . He started at the boiler . " Inside b'long steam . Live steam , " he said , thumping the boiler shell . " Strong steam . " Po-han nodded . They traced the steam from the boiler shell to the feed pump throttle , and Po-han could not understand the difference between live steam going in and exhaust steam coming out . He just did not have the basic words and saying " exhaust " to him did not give him the idea behind the word . It was no good showing him pressuregauges . Po-han thought fifteen pounds on the exhaust gauge was " moh plashah " than one hundred thirty pounds on the steam gauge , because the exhaust gauge and its numerals were physically the larger . He could not read the numerals and he did not know the meaning of " pressure . " " Jesus . I do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began dulling the eager pain on Po-han 's face . " We 'll try a different way , " Holman said . This time Holman acted it out . He was live steam , coming along the line snorting and bulging his muscles , and the live steam did work in the feed pump , Holman reaching in to the crosshead with both arms , grunting heavily , pretending to lift the piston rod up and down as it stroked , and then the steam came out the exhaust valve wheezing , drooping , muscles slack , staggered over to the condenser and went to sleep , Holman 's folded hands beside his head . Po-han went through the same act . His eyes never left Holman 's face . He understood that the steam got tired in the pump , but he thought it died in the condenser . Richard McKenna 42 " Maskee . This side steam makee dead , " Holman said , slapping the condenser shell . He knelt and bled water from a cock on the air pump discharge . " Before steam , just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead steam . " " Stim dead ! Stim dead ! " Po-han knelt with the water flowing over his fingers and his eyes sparkled . He knew fire turned water to steam in the boiler , but apparently he had never realized that a flow of river water through the condenser turned steam back into water . The thought excited him . Holman became water and made undulating motions along the condensatedischarge line to the hot well . Po-han followed , undulating too . At the hot well he pointed to the water in the gauge glass . " Stim dead ! " Holman nodded and grinned . He undulated from the hot well along the feed suction line into the water end of the feed pump . Po-han followed . Holman came out of the feed pump still undulating silently , but stiffly , fists clenched and muscles bulging to indicate increase in pressure . Po-han followed suit , but he looked puzzled . lie did not understand pressure . Holman undulated stiffly through the feed heater and began making a sizzling noise . " This side makee hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature difference between inlet and outlet . Po-han understood . Holman sizzled and undulated along the feed line to the feed check on the boiler shell , pushed open an imaginarytrap door , clacked and went into the boiler . Po-han clacked and went in too . His face was like a searchlight . He looked at llolman and tapped the bottom of the boiler gauge glass . " Stim dead ! " Then he tapped the steam space above the water in the glass . " Stim live ! Stim live ! " It was wonderful to see his face . He was just realizing in his own fashion the life-and-death cycle of the steam , endlessly repeated , and how it tied together pumps , piping and heat exchangers into the big magic . He looked like Columbus discovering America . Suddenly , his Chinese face alive with joy , he began acting out the steam cycle again , as Holman had done it . Holman followed , grin-43 The Sand Pebblesfling . When Po-han came back as water to the feed pump , his face shadowed and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He did n't know how to ask and Holman did n't know how to tell him . " Pressure , " Holman said . " Makee pressure . " " Plashah . " It was just a noise in the air to Po-han . " Push . Workee , " Holman said . " Inside boiler live steam have got too much pressure . Suppose water wanchee go inside boiler , no have got pressure , no can open door . " He imitated the clack of the feed-check valve . Po-han was trying very hard , almost crying , but he could n't get it . Holman dropped the feed pressure by fifty pounds and tapped the gauge . " You belong water . Just now no have got pressure , " he told Pohan . He motioned Po-han to come along the feed line and Po-han did , undulating stiffly and doubtfully . " My belong live steam , have got too much pressure , " Holman said . He began snorting and grasped Po-han 's bare , sweaty shoulders and pushed him backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump . Then he stopped and raised the feed pressures back to normal and tapped the gauge . The feed check on the boiler began clacking again . " Now you have got pressure ! " Holman put Po-han 's hands against his shoulders . " Now push me , pushee live steam ! " he said . Po-han pushed weakly . " Workee ! Have got too much plashah ! " Holman said . Po-han pushed harder and Holman 's feet began to slide . He slid backward , his hands resting lightly on Po-han 's shoulders , and he saw the pure light of joyful learning come back into Po-han 's face . This time he really had the idea , with no dark spots left in it anywhere . " Plashah ! Plashah ! " Po-han cried . " Pressure ! " Holman echoed him , grinning happily too , and then he saw somebody in white watching them from the gratings . He dropped his hands , feeling foolish and embarrassed . Po-han , unseeing , went on to clack once more into the boiler . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the other watertender , the one junior to Burgoyne . Holman did not remember his name . " I got to write up the log , " he said . " I did n't want to break up any-thing . " He had a perky , sparrowy manner , to match his long nose and beady eyes , and a nasty little grin . " I was teaching him the steam cycle , " Holman said . " That what you call it ? " He did not quite dare make the wisecrack he wanted to . Holman set his jaw . " He do n't know enough English . He did n't know what pressure ' means , " Holman said . " 1 had to act it out for him . How would you do it ? " " I would n't bother . He already knows all he needs to know . They 're all too stupid to learn anything . " Holman flushed . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " I forgot your name . " " My name 's Perna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holman said harshly . " Everybody 's got a right to learn . Whoever wants to learn what I know , I 'll teach ' em ! " " You do n't have to get your bowels in an uproar about it , " Perna said . He made a face and went around the engine to the log desk . " I wo n't be surprised if I end teaching this coolie a damned sight more than you got brains enough to learn ! " Holman called after him . He went up the ladder , angry again . He had met that kind on other ships . He knew them now by their very tone of voice and manner . They sat on a nickel 's worth of knowledge as if it were the great Inca treasure , and if anyone junior to them learned something , they thought they were being robbed . Nothing in the world delighted Jake Holman more than bankrupting a son of a bitch like that . He could not go to sleep . Shadowy pipe and valves and fittings kept sliding across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angry knot left in his stomach and he could hear a faint buzzing be-45 The Sand Pebbleshind his left ear . It had been a long while since he had heard that buzzing . It came only when he was very tired or worked up about something , something like the clash with Perna . It always led his mind back to where it had first started , and he could only get rid of it by going back there . It was not a very nice place , back there . He had wanted very badly to finish high school , so where he had finished was in the jail in Wellco , Nevada , because that was how things worked in Wellco , Nevada . The town marshal was beating him up in a little room with a rough cement floor . The marshal had a blackjack swinging from his wrist , but he only used his fists . Holman could not seem to fight back . At sixteen , he was too near being a man to break and cry and not yet man enough to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing and he was losing the feel of his body and he could only keep getting up again from the floor that smelled like carbolic acid . The marshal 's face never changed , lean and leathery , not angry , not enjoying it , just doing a job in the same way he sometimesbroke remounts for the U.S. Cavalry in the pole corral at the edge of town . And so he broke Joris K. Holman down at last to his hands and knees in a mess of his own blood and vomit sharp and burning in his throat . Holman shuddered convulsively in his bunk . He was sweating all over . It was easier in court . The buzzing made a kind of dream screen between Holman and the rest of them . Garbage Tin , the school superintendent , was there , his eyes still blacked . Judge Mason would not take Holman 's word against Garbage Tin 's , about the lie . But Judge Mason did fix it up about Holman 's age and got him into the navy . To the end Garbage Tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The navy was a lot like reform school , but they paid you for it . They made Holman a fireman , because of his husky build , and when he got a ship he could go ashore with a little money in his pocket , for the first time in his life . He made no friends on the ship and he avoided civilians ashore . He hated civilians . He found a pock-marked Mexican whore on Pacific Street , with a kind , sweet face , and sheRichard McKenna 46could make the buzzing go away for hours , sometimes for days . He kept going back to Maria . Aboard ship he hated all military crap and he hated personnel inspection most of all . You had to stand at attentionwith your eyes fixed on an imaginary spot three feet ahead and six inches up while the captain talked about you to your division officer as if you could no more see nor hear than a piece of machinery . At those moments the buzzing was very bad . They were all excited because they were Making the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The posters of Uncle Sam pointing and glaringreminded him too much of Garbage Tin . He heard that in the Asiatic Fleet there for Standard Oil , Robert Dollarand Jesus Christ . All old Asiatic sailors were supposed to be crazy . Holman 's shipmates thought he was dim-witted , and sometimes they called him Asiatic . He decided slowly that he wanted to go to China , but he found it very hard to take initiative in anything in those days . Then his division officer dumped him in a China draft , to get rid of him , and so he went to China anyway . Holman sighed and relaxed quite a bit . His stomach was easing . It was much better in China . The whores were all like Maria , and the Japanese girls were the best ones of all , and they soothed and healed Jake Holman . The buzzing softened down and he began coming out from behind his dream screen . He liked it ashore . He liked junks and sampans and rickshaws and pagodas and tiled roofs with upturned corners . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of everything from dried duck gizzards to lacquered coffins . He loved the hanging red-and-gold signs he could n't read and the yelling Chinese arguments he could n't understand and the twangy , jangling music that did not sound like music . It all made him know that he was a hell of a long way from Wellco , Nevada . He began taking more interest in his work aboard ship , and then he discovered the big secret . Holman relaxed altogether . He could barely hear the buzzing behind his ear . The secret was simple . They could not get along without the47 The Sand Pebblesmachinery . If it did not run , the ship would be a cold , dark , dead hulk in the water . And it did not work with engines to order them to run and to send down the marines to shoot them if they did not run . No admiral could court-martial an engine . All machinery cared about a man was what he knew and what he could do with his two hands , and nobody could fool it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you broke the rules it did n't matter how important or charming or pure in heart you were , you could n't get away with it . Machinery was fair and honest and it could force people to be fair and honest . Jake Holman began to love machinery . It brought his mind alive again . Just as it had been with him in high school , he found that he could learn the inner secrets of machinery faster than anybody else . Just as it had been with his high school teachers , he discovered the basic ignorance of his senior petty officers , and of course they hated him for that . But they were also accountable to their officers for the machinery , and they were all secretly afraid of their machinery , and when they were convinced that Jake Holman knew more about it than they could ever learn , they were happy enough to let him take care of it and keep them out of trouble . The only favor he wanted in return was to be excusedfrom all musters and inspections and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant , and they always granted it . Wheneverhe could , Holman always transferred to a smaller ship . The smaller the ship , the less they had of military crap . Holman yawned and stretched his arms and the buzzing was all gone . This ship was the smallest yet , and it had as much military crap as a battleship . But they still had to have the machinery . And she really was a home and a feeder . He would worry about the rest of it tomorrow . He went to sleep. 3For turn-to next morning Holman walked around the engine room with Lynch . He was wearing his new white shorts and he felt very silly dressed like that in an engine room . This first walk and talk about the machinery on a new ship was always a kind of mental wrestling match , with the new man trying to show the chief how much he knew . Lynch would n't wrestle . Holman scratched his thumbnail on pump rods and commented that they were steam cut . He shook valve gears and the loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " That 's all we give a damn about . " The other engineers were all down there too in shorts , and their day 's work was only a gesture . Burgoyne looked around the fireroom while Perna checked the bunkers , and then they both made out the coal report . Stawski followed two coolies around and watched them jack over idle pumps with a crowbar . Wilsey watched a gang of cooliesjack over the main engine . The jacking gear was a removable worm that engaged a worm wheel around the shaft just aft of the engine . They turned the worm with a long ratchet bar , and it took three coolies hauling at it with a rope and singing , " Hay ho ! Hay ho ! " while a fourth coolie squatted and threw the bar clicking back after4849 The Sand Pebbleseach heave . Holman could barely see the balanced tons of . metal move . " Are them coolies dogging it , or is she really that stiff ? " he asked Lynch . " She 's stiff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 'll free up , with a day 's steaming . " Chien followed them around the engine room . He ignored Holman . He was very attentive to Lynch . Lynch told Chien various small cleaning and repair jobs to do . Holman simply could not draw Lynch into technical talk . " There ai n't no blueprints . Nobody ever knew the valve settings , " Lynch said . " Chinamen in Hong Kong built her for the Spaniards , Christ knows how long ago . So long ago her frames and plates are all wrought iron . " " I been noticing the dents . " " You ought to see her in drydock , all humps and hollows . She just ai n't got the springback steel has , " Lynch said . He laughed . " She 's a beat-up old bitch , but by God she 's a home ! " After battle drills Holman had to go with Lynch again , to sign Title B cards in the CPO quarters . The quarters were aft on the boat deck , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stateroom for the Chinese pilot . There were wicker armchairs outside under the awning and broad-leafed plants in green wooden tubs , and the Chinese messcookwas sitting in one of the armchairs shining shoes . Inside , the CPO bunks had blue spreads , but otherwise the place was no more clean and spacious than the crew 's compartment , directly below it on the main deck . " Lemon ! Catch coffee ! " Lynch told the messcook . They were alone at the round table inside . Holman had a big stack of cards to sign . On each one he had to cross out Pitocki 's name . Lemon brought coffee in a porcelain pitcher and set out two of the CPO cups with handles . Lynch leaned and pulled a bottle of rum out from under a bunk . He held it up and sloshed it . " You 'll have some , wo n't you ? " Richard McKenna 50 " Sure . And much obliged , " Holman said . Lynch splashed rum in the cups . He filled his own half full . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding , like wax that was too warm , and his brown hair was very thin on top . The hot coffee in the rum made an aromatic smell . " Here 's how , " Lynch said . He tossed off half his cup and snorted . " Ai n't how for me , " Holman said , grinning . He sipped at his cup . " Needed that ! " Lynch said . " Holman , I hear you locked horns withold Chien yesterday . " Holman went on guard . " It was n't much . We both saved face . " " Well , you know how slopeheads are about face and old custom , " Lynch said . " 1 got to cut you in on how we do things on this ship . Itai n't like the Fleet ships you 're used to , not a bit . " When you wanted something with a bilge coolie you always went through old Chien , he said . Same with the deck coolies , you went to Pappy Tung . You never got familiar with deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the compartment coolies , because they knew their places . And you never wore dungarees except to stand a steamingwatch . " Like you yesterday , in the bilges and all dirty , " Lynch said . " It made it look like you did n't trust Chien , so he lost face . And you lost face for being so dirty . " " That 's how it is on here , huh ? " " That 's how it is . " Lynch poured more rum for himself . It was putting a sparkle in his pouched eyes and his face looked firmer . " No , thanks . " Holman waved away the bottle . " What work do we do , and what do they do , down in that engine room ? " " They do the coolie work , the dirty stuff and the mule hauling . We give ' em the jobs , supervise and inspect . And we keep up the paper work . " Lynch squinted at Holman . " Oh , we make the big decisions , and we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chien carries the load . " " Whatever happens down there that ai n't routine ? " " Nothing ! Nothing , by God ! " Lynch leaned back and laughed . " Old Chien 's been aboard more than twenty years and not much can51 The Sand Pebbleshappen he ai n't seen and handled before . That 's what 's good about it . " Holman poured himself more coffee . He kept his face straight . " Keep old Chien happy , give him what he wants , and you can just forget about the Goddamned machinery , " Lynch said . It was clear enough that Chien had the place on this ship that Holmanwanted for himself . But how could he ever ease Chien out of it if all engine work was coolie work and he was not a coolie ? He saw Lynch eying him oddly and he tried to grin . " Get out of that Fleet way of thinking , " Lynch said . " We ai n't in no engineering competition . We ai n't got any division maneuvers or drill schedules to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Man 's ass if we break down . We do n't even have typhoons and we ai n't never out of sight of land . Engineering just ai n't important on this ship . " " I guess you 're right , " Holman said sadly . " What is important is face and old custom . " Lynch sipped at his coffee royal . " Take shaving . It 's old custom that Clip Clip shaves all hands . " He rubbed his jaw . " Hell , I 'd feel abused if I had to shave myself . I probably forgot how . " " The coolies get paid by squeeze , huh ? " " And how , they squeeze ! " Lynch nodded vigorously . " On coal and stores and chow  --  oh , I could tell you some stories . But you 'll see . " He chuckled . " It all goes to Lop Eye Shing . Sew Sew and Press Press and Clip Clip 's take , the tips , everything goes to Shing and he shares it out again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one boy for the ship , been aboard twenty-five years , " Lynch said . " He 's half paralyzed , you do n't see him on deck much . But he 'll be up tomorrow for payday . " Holman stood up . " I got ' em all signed , " he said , pushing the cards toward Lynch . " Thanks for the rum . And for the good advice . " Lynch waved a hand . " Good for us both . " In the compartment they were drinking coffee at the mess tables and waiting their turns for a shave . Holman poured a cup and sat down and Burgoyne shoved a paper at him . Richard McKenna 52 " Put your name down for your turn , " he said . " Do n't need a shave right now . " Holman knuckled his jaw . He had a stubble , but he knew it was too light in color to show much . " Ought to have a clean shave to take the quarterdeck , " Farren said . " You got the twelve-to-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's section . Holman looked at Farren 's beard . " Maybe I 'll grow me a beard , " he said . " It 's a free country , " the gunner 's mate said . They were not as friendly as yesterday . On any other ship Holman would not have cared about that , because he would have the machinery to back him up . He did not know about this ship . I will get shaved , he thought , and then , no , God damn them , shaving was a man 's own private business . They left Holman out of the talk . They were all kidding Clip Clip , talking about bending him on like a messenger and discussing his good and bad points as a piece of duhai . Clip Clip was a nervous , wizened old Chinaman in a white U.S. Navy surgical gown , and he was very fast and expert with his shaving . He shrilled and chattered back at the sailors , making a great show of anger , and they all laughed at him . A big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cheek , sneaked up and goosed ( lip ( lip . The old man jumped and squealed and turned , waving his razor . " My cuttee you neck ! " he shrilled . Ellis retreated , to a burst of laughter . " Every time you goose him , he adds twenty cents to your bill , " Farren told Ellis . " Serves you right . " " Aw , you reckon he 'd do that ? You reckon old ( ' lip Clip 'd do a thing like that to a shipmate ? " I ilis said . They all laughed some more . After a while Wong , the messcook , started putting out the mess gear for dinner . Bronson was a fleshy , important-looking first-class quartermaster . He stood stiffly on the quarterdeck and reeled off the watch dope to Holman : ships in port , senior officer present , weather . . . . Holman53 The Sand Pebbleshardly listened . He was hating it already and thinking how you relieveda steaming watch in an engine room . You went down early and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledgehow things were , you went to the throttle and told the guy , " Okay , I got it . " He did not understand half of what Bronson was saying . He did not know anything about this topside military crap and he did not want to learn . He was wishing that he had never put his name in for the U.S.S. San Pablo . " That 's the information , up to the moment . " Bronson stood waiting . " Okay , I guess I got it , " Holman said . " You 're supposed to salute me and say , I relieve you , sir . ' " Rage rippled over Jake Holman . " It ai n't regulation for enlisted men to salute each other , " he said , trying to control his voice . " On this quarterdeck we 're both junior officers of the deck , " Bronson said . " It 's how we do it on here , Holman . " " If you was sitting in God 's own armchair , you 'd still be an enlisted man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't salute you . I never did believe in that kind of crap . " Bronson turned pale . His lips pinched in and he looked at Holman in silence for almost a minute . Then he saluted and said , " I hereby turn the watch over to you , sir . " Holman checked his impulse to salute back . He turned his guilt to anger . " Okay , I got it , " he said , more surly still . " Give me that Goddamned peashooter . " His face was burning . Silently , Bronson unbuckled his pistol belt , and silently Holman buckled it on himself . Bronson went away . The pistol lay heavy and accusing against Holman 's thigh and the Chinese messenger was looking at him curiously . Holman knew he had gone too far . He had long known that his dislike of military crap was like a private disease , which no one else could understand . Other guys hated it and said so , but it did not curdle the inside of their bones . New panic tried to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hind legs . Like a whore in church . He stood at attention and looked down at his hairy bare legs and saw that his knees touched and his ankles touched and there was a long , Richard McKenna 54narrow , figure-eight gap between his knees and his ankles . He had never noticed that before . He did not know whether he was knockkneedor bowlegged . What am I doing here , he thought . Jesus Christ on a crutch , what am I doing here ? An old help he had once used came back to him . They could commandyou what you had to do , he thought , but they could not commandyou how you had to feel about it , although they tried . So you did things their way and you felt about them your own way , and you did not let them know how you felt . That way you kept the two things separate and you could stand it . Slowly , Holman began getting hold of himself . He was able to return the salutes when he checked out the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was senior OOD , and he came down and stood most of the watch with Holman . He was breaking Holman in , instructing him in the watch duties without seeming to , just passing along information while he talked casually about things . Franks was probably not trying to sound out his attitudes , Holman decided . Franks had a plain , straight manner , and he was not one of the sly , watching kind . It turned out to Holman 's reliefthat he would not have to know anything about seamanship . " Pappy Tung looks after all that stuff without anybody telling him , " Franks said . " He 's the best seaman aboard . " Pappy Tung seemed to have the same position on deck that Chien had in the engine room . He was a short , sturdy old Chinese with a dark face that seemed carved out of wood . Like the other deck coolies , he wore navy undress whites without insignia , but he also wore a black neckerchief to mark his rank . " That 's good . I sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important thing was the smart appearance of the ship , smart side and boat courtesies and , most of all , exchanging salutes with passing ships . Bugle calls , hand salutes and color dips had to be timed and spaced exactly right . Lt. Collins had a very raw nerve for passinghonors , Franks said , and if they did not go off exactly right he would raise hell . Franks handled the ceremony for the several ships55 The Sand Pebblesthat passed , to show Holman how to do , it . They only exchanged salutes with treaty power flags . A few rusty steamers flew the fivebarredChinese flag , but they did not make dips . The big junks did not bother with flags , unless you could call a white cloth with the skipper 's name in Chinese characters a flag . " That 's the kind of flags most of the warlords down in Hunan use , " Franks said . " The slopeheads just do n't savvy flags , is all . " Junks did have a kind of passing ceremony , when one junk overhauledanother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch one on the river . The faster junk was trying to cut sharp across the bow of the slower one and they were neck and neck and curving in toward the bank . On the smaller , slower junk the crew was screamingand beating gongs and shooting firecrackers . Franks chuckled . " That big boy 's trying to unload his devils on the little fellow . " Holman knew about that . They believed that devils held hands and tailed on behind a junk , more and more of them as time passed , and the only way to get rid of the devils was to cross the bow of another junk . If you could force another junk to cut through your string of devils , your cut-off devils would join his string and you went on your way bobtailed and lucky again . " We keep a tub of spuds on the bridge to throw at ' em , when they try that stuff on us , " Franks said . " Ignorant bastards , ai n't they ? " " I guess it 's real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the small junk was going to get a new load of devils , for all their noise and trying , and he felt a bit sorry for them . His other watch duties were to keep the log and carry out inport routine , sweepdowns , sick call and so forth . Most of the things had a bugle call attached and the watch messenger was also the bugler . There were four of them aboard and they were all named Fang . " So you do n't have to worry about telling ' em apart , " Franks said . The four Fangs were Lt. Collins ' addition to the ship . He had had Lop Eye Shing hire them away from the warlord army in Changsha . Paying them had raised the squeeze quite a bit and cigarettes and beer had each gone up a dime . Richard McKenna 56 " I had to let ' em squeeze all the canvas I was going to use for new awnings , " Franks said . " Was the ship as regulation military before Lt. Collins came aboard as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . It always has been . " Franks looked out over the pontoon . " He 's hot about it , all right . He can get kind of mystical about it and make you feel funny . But he 's just the right skipper for down in Hunan Province . " By the end of the watch Holman was almost at case . There was a signal watch on the bridge and a roving sentry and when they reported , on the hour , Holman exchanged smart salutes with them . When Farren relieved him at four o'clock , Holman said all the right things and exchanged salutes with Farren . He had the split set up in himself again , and it was working all right . From the quarterdeck he went down into the engine room to write up the log there , because he had also been standing the engine room watch officially on paper . It still seemed like a fantastic joke . Chien and his coolies were knocking off and Chien blew the boiler glass just as Holman came down . They exchanged blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . He felt slightly like an intruderwhen he went around to the log desk . He entered the four o'clock temperature and pressure readings in the various columns of the log sheet . Then he tilled them in for the three previous hours , and he felt like a sneak . Faking readings like that was called " radioing , " and it was an engineering sin . He signed his name to the log , and his name was a lie . Because the coolie who had really stood the watch was not even aboard , officially on paper , and he was only represented on the log sheet by tally marks in the margin for the buckets of coal he had burned . Well , that was how they did it on the U.S.S. San Pablo . That was what it meant to be a Sand Pebble . At sunset Franks mustered the duty section on the fantail and they made evening colors . Coolies watched it from the bank , but it was not much of a show . Holman turned in early and the Fang called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his bunk frame . The deck coolies were never supposed to touch you . There was nothing to do on the quarterdeck watch at night , except to write up the log . The Fang squatted and went to sleep beside the boat deck ladder and Holman was alone . He looked up the bank to the corner of the brick wall where he had stood and had his first look at the San Pablo two nights ago , and he shook his head . The deck log was a lot different from the engine room log . You had to put in the deck log what ships were in port and what kinds of clouds were in what parts of the sky and the direction and force of the wind . Holman had to search for the north star , finding the Big Dipper first , and he had not looked at the stars in years . The high , strung-out clouds drifted among the bright stars as if a strong wind blew up there , but there was only a light breeze on the river . The river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big river , already a mile wide six hundred miles from the sea . A few lights bobbed on it and there were more lights on the far bank . There was a pagoda over there , and an old walled city named Wuchang , but at night they blended with the dark , humpy hills . " High , scattered , moving clouds all over the sky , " he wrote in the deck log . He logged the air temperature and pressure from the barometer and also the river temperature and depth . Those were temperatures and pressures and water levels , just as you logged them in the engine room , he thought , but up here you could not adjust them if they were wrong . You could not know when they were wrong . Down beloweven the illiterate coolies knew that much , from red limit marks on the pressure gauge dials and pieces of string around water-level glasses . It was much better down below . You did not care which way was north ; you went by port and starboard , fore and aft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night or what the weather was , unless it got rough enough to pitch the screw out of the water or ship a sea down the skylight . In the engine room you had control of things . Holman paced across to the port side and back again , several angry times . Well , with the bugle you controlled a lot of what people did fromRichard McKenna 58the quarterdeck , he thought . What the ship did as a ship , as in renderingpassing honors . The gangplank was there . It was a kind of gate or threshold , the place where the ship officially touched the world . The gap in the bulwark was flanked by two big wooden slabs with eagles carved on them . Lots of ships in China had those slabs ; they were made cheaply ashore in the same shops that made chests and coffins . There was another eagle slab fastened to the bulkhead above the log desk and a long , narrow slab slung from the overhead just inboard of the light . It had a carved dragon and the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a name board mounted on the slab above the log desk . Something made the quarterdeck sacred , so that anyone coming on it always had to salute . But the Chinese did not have to salute the quarterdeck . The thing is to act like it 's sacred but not believe it , Holman reminded himself . Because after all it was only a small , triangular area of deck where the midship passageway met the starboard main deck gallery . Its only furniture was the arms locker under the boat deck ladder and on the other side the varnished log desk up against the white wooden bulkhead that enclosed the crew 's compartment . Almost all of the ship 's superstructure was wooden , and it had been built on the San Pablo 's wrought-iron hull after she had come to the river . She was much too topheavy ever to go to sea again . The log desk stood on high legs and you wrote standing up . The slanting top lifted up and inside were spare pencils , a pair of binoculars , a box for liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on liberty . That was all there was to the quarterdeck . There was no machinery . Well , that brass clock is a kind of timechopping-upmachine , Holman thought . The pistol on his hip was a kill-people machine . But the pistol was more like a power tool and so were all the other guns in the arms locker , and the cutlasses in there were hand tools . The name board beside the clock was like a status board in a big engine room , with pegs or tags to tell you at a glance what pumps were on and what important valves were closed or open . The name board had twenty-four names , each on a separate little59 The Sand Pebblesstick that slid in a groove . There were parallel columns for " Aboard " and " Ashore " and you slid the sticks from one to the other as the peoplecame and went . The top name was Lt. William Collins , USN , Commanding , and he was ashore . So was P. A. Lynch , CMM , ashore . They said Lynch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names was C. J. Pitocki , MM 1 /c , and he was aboard . They had all been telling him what a fine old guy old Pitocki was , Holman thought . They did n't want Jake Holman on their ship . They wanted some nameless , faceless raw material that they could nudge and pinch and shape into another Pitocki . It was a weird , lonely night notion , and it bothered Holman . He tried to scratch out Pitocki 's name and broke his pencil point on the transparent tape guarding it . Pitocki was unscratched . Sure , old Pitocki 's aboard , Holman thought . You do n't get rid of a twelve-year plankowner just by killing the bastard . The panic he had felt at noon began creeping over him again . He tried to visualize his own face , and he could not . He knew he had a firm , squarish face and a strong jaw and gray eyes spaced wide under bushy eyebrows , but he could not make himself see it . All he could get was magnified glimpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jaw , with lather and a razor scraping , or his hand with a comb parting his short , sandy hair above a vague , wide forehead . He was about to go aft and look in a mirror when the dozing Fang jumped to his feet . Holman saw a slim , erect figure in service whites walking briskly down to the pontoon . It was Lt. Collins . Lt. Collins returned the new man 's salute and started up the ladder to the boat deck . On impulse he stopped and turned , standing with his face in shadow and looking down at the new man , Holman , in the light beside the log desk . " Holman , how do you feel about this ship by now ? " he asked . " Do you think you 'll like this duty ? " " I like it fine , sir . " They always said that . They thought they had to . " Are you sure ? Do n't be afraid to speak up . " He made his voice friendly and reassuring . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all my life , sir , " Holman said . " I ca n't hardly believe yet how good it is on here . " " I mean the whole ship . The duty . I ) o you think you will be happy in this ship ? " Holman licked his lips . " When I get used to these topside watches , sir  --  I 'm more used to things down below I guess I will , sir . " He was not being candid . Lt. ( ' ollins began questioning him . He wanted to discover that puzzling something hinted at but not revealedby Holman 's service record . The man had grown up in a poor family in a small Western town . He had dropped out of high school to join the navy during the war . It was a perfect background for a career man . His frequent transfers Holman explained by saying that he wanted experience with new machinery plants . All his transfers had been at his own request . It did not explain his low marks in leadershipcontrasting with almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct way to ask him about that . " Can you say what you really feel about machinery , Holman ? " " It 's real , sir . " " What do you mean ? " The man pondered . " Well . . . other ships I been on . . . military stuff , drills and inspections . . . in the end , somebody gives you a mark on it . " He was grasping painfully for words to clothe his thought . " I mean , it 's always inside somebody 's head , like . But machinery runs good or bad or it do n't run at all . You ca n't fool yourselfor anybody else about it . It 's just . . . there . The same for everybody . " He was red and sweating from effort . " In the end the test of the military stuff is life or death in battle and possibly freedom or slavery for the country which gives one life . " He said it gently . The man seemed honest in his confusion . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins thought . There were the men who gave and took death in battle . There were the other men who shuffled papers and cooked beans and such , logistic support for the fighters . The army could keep them separate . In a ship , they all went into battle together . You could not make the distinction between man and man . It had to be made within each man , and each man had61 The Sand Pebblesconstantly to make it for himself . Military ceremony was a powerful help in that . The distinction was built into a man in his boot training and the military ritual thereafter maintained it . " You know the twofold nature of duty . " " Yes , sir . Military is most important . " He knows it as a verbal formula , Lt. Collins thought . Unconsciously he probably rejects it and that shows up in his behavior in some way that earns him those low marks in leadership . Lt. Collins made his voice firm but kindly . " San Pablo is not a Fleet ship , Holman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight and die that we avoid having to do so . No man can be excused . " " Yes , sir . I never meant  --  " " Anyone can learn technical skills . In San Pablo Chinese do the dirty work and routine drudgery . Military duty demands a certain spirit of instant readiness to deal in life and death . Only the very best men , and no Chinese , are good enough for that . " " Yes , sir . " " The men in San Pablo are that kind of men . They are all old hands . If you feel that you are not their kind of man , now is the time to say so . " Holman said nothing . He could probably not admit a thing like that , even to himself . But a strained look was growing on his face . The shoe was pinching . " We start summer cruising Monday . I still have time to swap you back to the Fleet , if you feel you will not be happy in my ship . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll learn what I need to . I 'll measure up , sir . " It was clear that he meant it . Lt. Collins smiled slightly . " Very well . I may talk to you again , in a few days . " He went on up the ladder and stopped outside his cabin , at the boat deck rail . The talk had begun a train of thought in him . That often happened , and he had no one with whom he could talk out such trains of thought . You should keep a journal , he told himself . The ley was death . In Cromwell 's time everybody knew aboutRichard McKenna 62death . The church saw to that . But now the people did not like anything that reminded them of death . The naval uniform marked men whose primary purpose in life was to deal in violent death . People would rather not have to know that , even some who wore the uniform . A few years back Josephus Daniels had put chaplains and paymastersinto the same uniform as line officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The current recruiting slogans were pure Josephus Daniels : Join the navy and learn a trade . Every battleship a school . It was no wonder the men tended to forget the primary purpose of their lives . The only true recruiting poster was one they did not use any more . It was Uncle Sam pointing and saying I need you . Any man who wanted a better reason than that did not belong in the navy . Well , the men in San Pablo were all right . Chinese handled their logistics and the Sand Pebbles could be pure , dedicated fighting men . If Holman was not one of them , they would know it and they would reject him . San Pablo 's isolation was a protection . But the way the times went , with the smart ones back in the States mocking their own history , Holman 's basic confusion could creep unseen into any man . Lt. Collins meant to call all hands aft for a talk before they started the summer cruise . This was the thing to talk about , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out across the dark water . His mind began forming simple phrases . He went into his cabin to jot a few of them down before he went to bed . On the quarterdeck , Holman paced anxiously . He had not thought before that he might be shanghaied off the ship . He did not want to go . He did not want to lose that bunk and locker and mess table . So he had lied to Lt. Collins . Well , he would just have to make it true . If they had no use for him as an engineer , he would have to become a good topside sailor . He resolved to give in on the shaving and do everything else he could to get on the right side of his shipmates . He was going to need their good will after all . He recognized the scared , qualmish feeling in his stomach . When63 The Sand Pebblesyou had something to lose , they had a way to put the fear of Christ into you . He could not stop pacing . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life when he had had something to lose. 4At breakfast Holman talked and tried friendly jokes and after drills he had Clip Clip shave him . The sailors drinking coffee were talking about Red Dog Shanahan , who had just finished two weeks of restric- tion for getting into a fight with Fleet sailors in Hankow . " You look pretty rugged , " Farren told Holman , in the barber chair . " You think you and me could take the Reg Dog for a run ashore and keep him out of trouble ? " " Be glad to try , " Holman said . " One of you can hold his mouth shut and the other one can hold his arms , " Wilsey said . " But who 'll hold his feet ? " " We 'll go to the Hole in the Wall . That 's just up the bank here , be- side the dockyard , " Farren told Holman . " We 'll wear shorts , and then we ca n't change our minds and go to Hankow . Hankow 's where the Red Dog runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , because Fleet ships were in port and all sailors ashore had to be dressed alike . " Sounds good . I 'll go , " Holman said . " You guys are my elders , if not my betters , " the Red Dog said . " I put myself in your hands . " 6465 The Sand Pebbles " I 'll bet anybody ten dollars you all come back under arrest , " Restorff , the gunner 's mate , said . " Oh , no , no , no , Gunner ! " Farren said . " The gunner always wins his bets , " he explained to Holman . " Do n't bet , Gunner ! " " Ca n't pass up easy money , " Restorff said . Everyone laughed . " I 'll take a dollar of that , Gunner , " Harris said . " I like to see guys get in trouble . " " Thanks , you kind-hearted shipmates , " Farren said sarcastically . " Harris , you cheap son of a bitch , you could at least of bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet you the other nine , Gunner , " Holman said . He leaned forward out of the barber chair to shake on it . The Hole in the Wall was a rough , stuffy little board-and-brick leanto and all they had was Horsehead beer served by two dumb and dirty Chinese girls . You could take the girls in back if you wanted to , Farren said . Who the hell wanted to , the Red Dog said . Holman did not talk much . He felt strange , being ashore with two topside sailors , and he knew that being accepted by the crew depended a lot on how he behaved on this first liberty . He would have to be agreeable , spend freely , and be game for anything . The beer was just cool , Limey fashion , and the girls brought chunks of ice to put in the glasses . The Red Dog picked up a chunk of the ice and squinted at it . " I can see the cholera bugs winking at me , " he said . " They all got slant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hankow . It was clean and cold and crystalline . It tinkled in the glass like the bells of fairyland . The Scotch whisky was smooth as a maiden 's brow and of a flavor so delicate that even the vast vocabulary of Red Dog Shanahan could not do it justice . " Belay that talk , " Farren said . " We got to make him stop that , Holman . He 's trying to undermine us . " " Cool , beautiful young Russian princesses . Virgin princesses . Green-eyed and graceful as cats . " The Red Dog sketched them with his hands in the air above the table . " Firm , rose-pointed breasts . SkinRichard McKenna 66like white rose petals . Curly , warm nests . " His voice and face were ecstatic . " Holman , we just got to put a sack over his head . We got to , or we 're lost , " Farren said . " He 'd get Jesus Christ in trouble , if he had him ashore . " Holman laughed . Farren reminded him of a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yapping little terrier . " You know , I 'm awash to the gunwales with this damned warm beer , " he said . " I 'd like a shot of whisky . " " If you great , monstrous bastards are awash , how do you think I feel ? " the Red Dog said . Farren stroked his heard . " Maskee , let 's go back to the ship and change into dress whites , " he said . He leaned to Holman 's ear and whispered , " We 'll shackle the little bastard to his bunk and go withouthim . " " Arf ! Arf ! Arf ! I heard that ! " The Red Dog jumped up on his chair and pointed accusing forefingers . " It 's mutiny ! " he cried . " Shame on you selfish sons of bitches ! " " I was joking . We 'll take you , " Farren said . " Come on aboard and change uniform . " " I do n't trust you . You ai n't going to trap me back aboard that ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You look like an honest man with no crap in your blood , Holman , " he said . " Let 's go up to Hankow and leave this bearded traitor here to founder himself . " " We 'd be out of uniform . How about the shore patrol ? " " We 'll go in a car , to the Green Front , " the Red Dog said . " It 's up an alley , and we can hire a kid to watch for the patrol . " " Okay , I 'm game , " Holman said . He stood up . " We 'll be sorry , " Farren said , standing up too . " You do n't Know this little pint of piss yet , Holman . He 's a devil . " They each took a beer to drink in the car , and it was cooler in the moving car with their shorts and short-sleeved shirts and their white sun helmets with the ship 's name across the front . The driver cursed and honked his way past brown-legged coolies pushing wheelbarrows67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twin baskets of green vegetables slung jouncing from shoulder poles . The road ran along the river bank and into Hankow along the broad , tree-lined bund . To the left , walkways ran down to pontoons with moored steamers and clusters of small craft . Most of the business buildings were of brick , several stories with arcaded verandas , and some had walls around them with gardens inside . It was a big , busy city , and there were many Sikh cops , as in Shanghai . There were five concessions in a row along the river , Farren said , but the German and Russian concessions belonged to the British now , on account of the British won the war . There was a victory monument for the war on the British bund , a lady angel on a pedestal , like the one in Shanghai , and beyond the British bund was the native city . Along the native bund the junks were three and four deep . The Green Front was a small place with a row of tables along one side and a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled cool and beery . Five sailors in dress whites were eating a meal at one of the tables and no one was at the bar . " Roll in , you Sand Pebbles ! " the bartender yelled when he saw them . " Hi , Farren . Red Dog , who let you out of your cage ? " He was a fat , pink man with thin white hair and a white shirt open at the neck . They introduced him to Holman as Nobby Clarke , a retired machinist 's mate and an old-time river rat . The back bar was stacked with bottles and there was also a stuffed pheasant and a photograph of an old sidewheeler . " That 's the old Monocacy , first gunboat on the river , " Farren told Holman . " When you see them wheels start to go round , it 's a sign you had enough and it 's time to go back to the ship . " " I steamed her , when I was a kid , " Nobby said . " She was a mankillingbitch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked fondly at the picture . The Red Dog was standing between Holman and Farren . Hethumped the leather dice cup on the bar and rolled five aces . " You got the devil on your side , Red Dog , " Nobby said . " He 's my uncle . When he dies , I 'll inherit hell . " Richard McKenna 68 " What 'll you do with hell ? " Farren asked . " I 'll sell it to the missionaries for a million dollars . " " You think you 're joking , but I believe you , you Irish peckerhead , " Farren said . " It 's true , " the Red Dog said . " Roll ' em , boys ! " Holman lost . He called for a new bottle of White Horse and said to leave it on the bar , which meant he was buying the bottle . The white-coated bar boy set up the drinks . In China , the white bartenders never mixed or served drinks . " Sure you 're that flush , Holman ? " Farren asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gunner , " Holman said . " Ho ho ho ! " Farren said . " That 's what you think . " They drank and talked and laughed , the Red Dog grinning up impishly from under his sun helmet cocked askew . They were all feeling the whisky and it was going to be one of the happy , floating drunks , Holman could tell . Some drunks were wild and jumpy and some were morose and savage and Holman 's drunks by himself were always sad and gloomy ones , but this drunk was floating . It was a knack the Red Dog had , to lift and carry a drunk . The Fleet sailors had finished their chow and were drinking at their table , talking in bursts and then falling silent , with morose faces , as if they could not get their drunk off the ground . They were from the U.S.S. Pigeon , a minesweeper . The Red Dog had taken the spirit of the place away from them , and they did not like it . " How come you guys up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're in uniform , " the Red Dog said . " We 're river rats , and this is our proper uniform . " One of the Pigeons started to sing " Subic " and the others joined hoarsely and they all went flat and false and petered out on the first verse . They were pretty drunk , but it was a heavy , lumpish drunk . The burly shipfitter they called Buffalo slapped the table . " God damn it ! " he roared . " Boy ! More drinks , you slant-eyed son of a bitch ! " He was a hulking man with a scarred , beaten-up face , probably a fighter . Holman knew how they were feeling ; they would not get drunker , they would just get meaner . One or another of the five kept69 The Sand Pebblesscowling at the Red Dog . They thought he was too cocky and happy . " Lynch was in a while back , " Nobby said . " With that Russian . " " She 's a cow , " the Red Dog said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginary breasts . " Red Dog , where 's them Russian princesses ? " Holman asked . " Right now they 're taking baths in donkey milk , " the Red Dog said . " They 're very special gear , Holman . They 're all directly descended from Ivan the Terrible . They wo n't come in till the rabble clears out . " A chair scraped behind them . " Hey , you guys , " Buffalo said . The Sand Pebbles swung around . Farren squeezed the Red Dog 's arm and frowned a signal to be quiet . " Seen any elephants today ? " Buffalo asked . " Not today , " Farren said . " Wearing them hats , I thought you might be hunting elephants . Want me to tell you how to catch a elephant ? " Holman squeezed the Red Dog 's other arm . " All we 're hunting today is white horses , " he said . " We already caught one . " He motioned his head at the bottle , almost empty now . " You want to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him your pretty white legs , " Buffalo said . The other Pigeons laughed jeeringly . They meant to start a fight . Nobby Clarke hurried around the bar . " Hold it , you guys ! Have a drink on the house , " he pleaded . " We 're the experts on elephants , " the Red Dog said . " We know elephants always come back to crap in the same place . So we find five piles of elephant crap and then we wait for the elephant . " Farren laughed and Holman joined him . They exchanged a look above the Red Dog 's head . We 'll take ' em , the glance agreed . It was a sudden warm bond between them and they turned the Red Dog loose . " Listen , slow down , take a turn , you guys ! Take your Goddamned argument outside , " Nobby was saying . " I saw some elephants over in the Jap Concession , " Buffalo said . " I think you better go over there . " He meant it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HeRichard McKenna 70set himself to take that Buffalo , when the thing blew . He knew his own quick , terrible strength could take down almost any man , and he feared an angry fight . But this would be a happy fight . " In case you elephant hunters lost your compasses , I 'll be glad to show you where the door is , " Buffalo said . The other Pigeons laughed nastily again and eased back their chairs . Their faces were ugly . " Oh , pee on you , John , " the Red Dog said in falsetto . Farren and Holman roared . It was a masterstroke of wit . The Pigeon 's Fleet nickname was Pea John and the Red Dog had insulted both the men and their ship . It stopped them cold . But , from their faces , in another heartbeat the air was going to be full of flying furniture . Nobby ducked behind the bar . Holman tensed for it . Footsteps sounded , the door opened , and four British sailors came in . They wore shorts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet and swept out a grand bow . " Dr. Bangerknox , I presume , " he said . " As I live and breathe , it 's Milord Red Arse Bite-'em-on-the-dog Shanahan ! " the foremost Limey said . " Hello , Farren . " He was a square , ruddy man of about Holman 's build and he was half drunk , but his gray eyes went keenly back and forth . He knew something was wrong . " We been hunting elephants and we caught a buffalo , " the Red Dog said . " What do you bold hunters know about buffaloes ? " " They 're vicious brutes . They charge with their eyes open , " the ruddy man said . " This buffalo 's up a stump . We ca n't make him charge . " " Not sporting to shoot unless he charges . " The Limeys were spreading out and balancing on their toes , siding with the Sand Pebbles without question . " Might take a reef in his tail , " the ruddy man said . " I 'll spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . They all chimed in with unprintable suggestions . The big shipfitter'slips were working and he was ready to go it blind mad . His shipmates could not face the sudden change in odds . " No , Martin . The hell with it , Martin , " they said , getting up . They did not call him71 The Sand PebblesBuffalo any more . They got him moving toward the door . " Come on , Martin , " they said . " Let 's find an honest American place to drink . " " Arf ! Arf ! Arf ! " the Red Dog barked after them . All the river sailors laughed . They were all at the bar with fresh drinks and the drunk was floating higher than ever . The ruddy man was Banger Knox , an engineer , and they were from H.M.S. Woodcock , which also cruised in Hunan Province . That made a bond between the two ships and they would always stand together against any Fleet ship or even a main river gunboat . The Hunan Chinese were much tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to Holman . The Woodcock 's nickname was Timber Dick , and the sailors were Timber Dicks , and in any main river port the Timber Dicks and Sand Pebbles always stood together . Farren told about the Red Dog 's stroke of wit against the Pea Johns and he had to explain it before the Limeys could laugh . " Fair baffles me how you blokes can twist a name into an insult , " Banger said . " You 've a low , nasty sort of talent for it . " They shouted each other down telling Holman about a fight last winter in Changsha . The Red Dog had begun calling the Limeys Limber Dicks , and after it had been explained to them they had all had a very good fight in a place called the Red Candle . " We tried for a fortnight after to hit on a good insult for Sand Pebble , " Banger said . " The best we could do was simple apple . " He looked pleadingly at Farren . " I hope you find that just a wee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples and horse apples . " Farren stroked his beard judicially . " I do n't know about simple apples . " " We 'll consider it a mortal insult , just to be friendly , " the Red Dog said . " Nobody but our fellow Hunanese can call us that . " Banger raised his glass . " Thank you , Milord Red Arse . " " But the Hunanese are the natives , " an English sailor said . " All right , we 're Hunaneers , " Holman said . " Us Hunaneers , we got no fears , " the Red Dog said . He began to sing , in a clear Irish tenor : Richard McKenna 72Us Hunaneers , we got no fears , We do not stop at trifles ; We hang our balls upon the walls And shoot at them with rifles . The Limeys thought that was very good . They explained that what made it so funny was that you could not really hang them upon the walls , you know . Holman began blanking out and coming back . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Limeys had a good song about the old bustard from Kent . ' Iwo more bottles of White Horse were on the bar and Nobby Clarke floated around back there like a pink balloon with sparse white hair . It was a very happy , highfloatingdrunk. liohnan talked very earnestly to Banger Knox . He had a profound new idea . Some men composed poems and some composed music , he explained to Banger , but Red l ) og Shanahan was the world 's finest artist at composing drunks . It was a shame the world did not know that about him . Too bloody right , Banger agreed . The Red Dog should be buried in Westminster Abbey . They decided solemnly to crown him drunkard laureate and they pulled tail feathers from the stuffed pheasant to stick in his helmet band as a crown . But the Red Dog thought that made him an Indian and he climbed on the bar and warwhooped and wardanced the length of it . There was shouting outside in the street and a bar boy went out to check and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys ! Hey , you guys ! " Nobby was saying . " If there 's trouble , you better go down to the bund and stand by . " " Let these main river people look after their own trouble , " Farren said . " We love everybody . " " We 're Hunaneers , " the Red Dog said . " We 're just visiting up here . " The thing about a floating drunk was that you were detached . You did not have to care about rules . You were floating so high and happy that the sad , serious people only laughed at whatever you did . It made them a little bit happy just to watch you and know how you were feeling and nobody wanted to shoot down a floating drunk. 73 The Sand PebblesFar off a power plant siren let go in short , fast hoots , on and on and on . Suddenly Nobby was wearing one of the washbasin British steel helmets and he was banging on the bar with a rifle butt . " Come on ! Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he was saying . " Come on , sailors ! Shove off down to the river ! " They were following the Red Dog down a wide street and Chinese in blue gowns and rags were running both ways . The store windows were all broken and so much torn white paper was on the street that it looked like snow . Two coolies were smashing a heavy iron grating edgewise down on new bicycles . Holman and Banger took the grating . They were much stronger men than the coolies and they could bring the grating thundering down like a Nevada stamp mill and bend a new bicycle almost double . The coolies kept pulling away the smashed bicycles and feeding in new ones . The crowd was thicker and it blocked them . The shaven Chinese heads were close together like cobbles in a pavement that also surged and heaved like a sea and a trapped rickshaw was like an island in it , shafts high , the fat Chinese passenger leaning forward onto the puller 's skinny brown shoulders . The Red Dog still had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Veins throbbed and swelled in the temples of the shaven heads and the mouths were open , screeching , and showing teeth and fluttering tongues . They pushed through into an open space and Farren still clutched a bottle of White Horse . It was about one-third full . He beckoned grandly with the bottle . " All hanje , " he said . " Time for lil drinkee . " It was a half-circle open space around the entrance to a cross street , and across the entrance was a line of Sikh cops and helmeted white civilians with rifles . They were yelling and motioning . One white man stepped forward . " Come inside , you drunken fools ! " he said . " They 'll kill you ! " " Not ush , " Farren said . " We 're Hooney  --  we 're Hunaneers . " " Come inside ! That 's an order ! " Richard McKenna 74The man pulled at Banger 's arm . Banger jerked away and looked very dignified . " You talk like a bloody Yank , chum , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hunaneer , you know . " The Red Dog began to sing . Us Hunaneers , we shed no tears , We give no damn for riches ; We prong our wives with butcher knives , Us hardy sons of hitches . More men came out and pushed and tugged them singing inside the line . Come on , you buccaneers , your officers are going to hear about this , the men said . Come on , for Christ 's sweet sake , before we all get killed ! They went along the street , staggering and stumbling , and firemen in red helmets were running past them the other way , unreeling white hose . They were going along beside a brick wall covered with stucco that had fallen off from big , scabby patches and a file of British sailors came by on the run and somehow carried off the Timber Dicks in their wake . Holman stopped . " You know , thish serious , " he said . They all stopped and looked back . Their drunk was coming down to earth . The yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great screeching , and white plumes of water shot up there . Further back , the British sailors were making a barricade of planks and a dismountedgate . The wall beside the barricade had sharpened bamboo stakes along the top and a big tree bushed greenly out over the wall . A woman with a pad and pencil came up from somewhere . She was not very young , and she looked frightened . " I 'm a reporter , " she said . " Do you think they 'll try to storm the armory ? " " Oh yes . They always storm the armory , " the Red Dog said . " Oh , you 're drunk ! " she said . She sounded disgusted . The woman went up to the barricade . The British sailors were lining out kneeling and they had a machine gun on a tripod and a young officer stood behind them with a sword . The plumes of water75 The Sand Pebbleswere falling back along the street and they wavered and stopped and the firemen fell back through the barricade . After them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they all went inside the compound . The woman went in with them . She turned in the gate to look back at the Sand Pebbles and the Red Dog threw her a kiss . " Krishe ! Got ta heave ! " Farren said . His eyes were bulged and glassy . The waving arms and shaven heads came down the street slowly as a tide makes and their frantic screeching filled the street . The young British officer walked back and forth slapping his leg with his sword . Above the shaven heads was a big sign for Three Castles cigarettes and the sudden crackling , volleying fire chopped through it and down into the crowd . The tripod danced and the machine gun throttled off the screeching like hands around a throat . The crowd was gone except for flopping , lumpish bundles criss-crossing each other on the street , and the firing ceased with a few after-pops . Farren was heaving and strangling , bent over , hands on stomach , his beard all foul . The sight and smell of it made Hoiman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Red Dog , take his other arm , " he ordered . " We got to get the hell out of here . " Around the second corner they ran into the American shore patrol . The drunk ended officially next day on the quarterdeck . Everyone not concerned with mast kept clear , but the ragged coolies on the pontoon watched it without understanding , as they watched everything on theSan Pablo . The three prisoners stood in line , hats in hand , facing the log desk , which had been moved across to stand right against the foot of the boat deck ladder . On the back of the log desk , ordinarily hidden , was a weather-stained card lettered : Shame on you bastards . It was an old San Pablo joke , but the three prisoners and the three chiefs standing in line inboard were very quiet and solemn . Lt. Collins came down the ladder and the chiefs saluted him . The prisoners did not have the privilege of saluting . Lt. Collins stood on the bottom step , where he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave them each in turn a cold , sharp stare . Then he turned his thin , dark face down to the paper on the desk before him . " You men are all charged with being drunk and out of uniform and with insolence to the shore patrol , " he said quietly . " Have you anything to say ? " Farren spoke for all three . " We just had too much to drink , sir , and we 're sorry now . " Franks stepped forward . " Farren is a good man , Captain , " he said . " He 's always clean and sober aboard and attentive to duty and very reliable . " In turn , Lynch and Welbeck stepped forward to say the same things about Holman and Shanahan . Lt. Collins turned his eyes back to the bareheaded prisoners and they were very cold eyes . " You are not specifically charged with what I consider your most serious offense , " he said . " There was a dangerous riot in progress . You should have placed yourselves under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or asleep , no matter what , you are fundamentally on duty every minute you draw breath . " His voice rapped harsh and cold at them : " There is no relief and no escape from your military duty ! " He slapped the desk for each no . " Do you clearly understand that ? " " Yes , sir , " they all said humbly . " Very well , then . " His voice lost its edge . " Holman , I am sorry to have to spoil your clean record so soon . Farren , your record already leaves much to be desired . " He looked at the Red Dog , dwarfed between Farren and Holman , and a twinkle came into his eye . " Shanahan , it is impossible for you to shock me any more , but I continue to be mildly disappointed in you , " he said . " I have no doubt whatever that , if the truth were known , you started that riot all by yourself . " He paused . " Stay aboard three weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , but he quickly hardened it and snapped , " Mast dismissed ! " and went back up the ladder . A few minutes later , drinking coffee in the compartment , Holman knew he was in . They were all calling him " Jake " and wanting to77 The Sand Pebbleshear the story of the big drunk again and what the captain said at mast . A well-composed drunk like that one always became a sea story , to be told and retold for years , and Jake Holman was already solidly a part of San Pablo folklore . He was a true Sand Pebble and there would be no more question of the captain swapping him back to the Fleet. 5It was their last day in Hankow and the skipper was going to make a talk after quarters . " He gets right fancy in them talks of his , " Burgoyne told Holman at breakfast . " You do n't know how to take it sometimes . " " Last Thanksgiving he told us how China is like Indian country in the old days in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the missionaries are the settlers . " " We 're the U.S. Calvary on the plains of Texas , " Wilsey said . " Prong the U.S. Calvary , " Harris said . " I hate dogfaces . " " I knew an old soldier once that was an Indian fighter , " Holmansaid . " We got lots of Indians back where I come from . " " Prong Indians too , " Harris said . " Pass that jam . " " It just now strikes me , the treaty ports and concessions are like Indian reservations , " Holman said . " Only it 's the palefaces that are on ' em . " " All but the missionaries , " Farren said . " The biblebacks are scattered all over hell 's half acre . They 're the ones give us all the trouble . " " Prong all missionaries twice , " Harris growled. 7879 The Sand PebblesWong brought Holman his dozen fried eggs . He explored the new thought as he ate the eggs . He liked new ways of looking at familiar things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After they made colors Bordelles put them at parade rest and Lt. Collins came to the edge of the grating to talk . As before , Holman was struck by the picture he made in white and gold against the great varnished wheel with the flag rippling red and white above it . Lt. Collins looked down , his thin face unsmiling . " Tomorrow we begin our summer cruising to show the flag on Tungting Lake and the Hunan rivers , " he said . " At home in America , when today reaches them , it will be Flag Day . They will gather to do honor and hear speeches . For us who wear the uniform , every day is Flag Day . We pay our honor in act and feeling and we have little need of words . But on this one day it will not hurt us to grasp briefly in words the meaning of our flag . That is what I want to talk about this morning . " He paused . Chinese quarreled noisily on passing junks . As always , ragged coolies watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . I want you to grasp what America really is , " Lt. Collins said , nodding for emphasis . " It is more than marks on a map . It is more than buildings and land . America is a living structure of human lives , of all the American lives that ever were and ever will be . We in San Pablo are collectively only a tiny , momentary bit of that structure . How can we , standing here , grasp the whole of America ? " He made a grasping motion . " Think now of a great cable , " he said , and made a circle with his arms . " The cable has no natural limiting length . It can be spun out forever . We can unlay it into ropes , and the ropes into strands , and the strands into yarns , and none of them have any natural ending . But now let us pull a yarn apart into single fibers  --  " he made plucking motions with his fingers "  --  and each man of us can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellowish thing , a foot or a yard long by nature . One American life from birth to death is like a single fiber . Each one is spun into the yam of a family and the strand of a home town andRichard McKenna 80the rope of a home state . The states are spun into the great , unending , unbreakable cable that is America . " His voice deepened on the last words . He paused , to let them think about it . It was a new thought and it fascinated Holman . Just by living your life you wound and you wound yourself into the big cable . The cable grew and grew into the future like a living thing . It was a living thing . The thought fascinated Holman . " No man , not even President Coolidge , can experience the whole of America directly , " Lt. Collins resumed . " We can only feel it when the strain comes on , the terrible shain of hauling our history into a stormy future . Then the cable springs taut and vibrant . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fibers press each to each in iron hardness . Even then , we know only the fibers that press against us . But there is another way to know America . " He paused for a deep breath . The ranks were very quiet . " We can know America through our flag which is its symbol , " he said quietly . " In our flag the barriers of time and space vanish . All America that ever was and ever will be lives every moment in our flag . Wherever in the world two or three of us stand together under our flag , all America is there . When we stand proudly and salute our flag , that is what we know wordlessly in the passing moment . " Holman 's eyes went to the flag . It looked almost alive , streaming and rippling in the breeze off the river . He felt that he had not ever really looked at the flag before . " Understand that our flag is not the cloth but the pattern of form and color manifested in the cloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been any pattern once , but our fathers chose that one . History has made it sacred . The honor paid it in uncounted acts of individual reverence has made it live . Every morning in American schoolrooms children present their hearts to our flag . Every morning and evening we render it our military salutes . And so the pattern lives and it can manifest itself in any number of bits of perishable cloth , but the pattern is indestructible . " A foul smell blew across the fantail . It was from a passing string of barges taking liquid Hankow sewage back to the fields that fed81 The Sand PebblesHankow . Sailors called them honey barges . The foul breeze made no difference in the bright , rippling appearance of the flag . " For us in San Pablo every day is Flag Day , " Lt. Collins went on . He was talking easily but earnestly . " Civilians are only morally bound to salute our flag . We are legally bound . All Americans are morally bound to die for our flag , if called upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in day to day readiness for that sacrifice . We have sworn our oaths and cut our ties . We have given up wealth and home life , except as San Pablo is our home . It marks us . It sets us apart . We are uncomfortable reminders , in time of peace . Those of you who served in the last war will know what I mean . " Heads nodded along the ranks . Holman nodded too . " It is said there will be no more war . We must pretend to believe that . But when war comes , it is we who will take the first shock and buy time with our lives . It is we who keep the faith . We are not honored for it . We are called mercenaries on the outposts of empire . But I want to speak for you an epitaph written for an army of mercenaries such as we in San Pablo . " He cleared his throat and spoke solemnly : These , in the day when heaven was falling , The hour when earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages and are dead . He paused again . There was some foot shuffling in the ranks . They did not want to take this stuff too personally , Holman knew . Lt. Collins hardened his expression . His eyes bored at them . He seemed to loom above them on the grating . His voice rang harshly . " We serve the flag . The trade we all follow is the give and take of death . It is for that purpose that the American people maintain us . Any one of us who believes he has a job like any other , for which he draws a money wage , is a thief of the food he eats and a trespasser in the bunk in which he lies down to sleep ! " It shocked them . Holman felt his cheeks burn . That was not the idea he had of himself . All along the ranks they were looking down at their feet . Richard McKenna 82Lt . Collins talked on , his voice quiet again . He talked about the flag code . There was a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was clean once more . The flag was a Person , Lt. Collins said . The union of stars was the flag 's honor point , its sword arm . You always displayed the flag so that it faced the beholders . There was only one time when the flag turned its back on the beholders . Lt. Collins ' voice became hushed . " That is at a military funeral , when one of us who has lived and died honorably goes to join the staff of the Great Commander , " he said . " Then our flag lies face down on the coffin and clasps the dead man in its arms . I am not ashamed to believe that in that moment the spirit of the dead man passes directly into our flag . That is our special reward , who keep the military faith . " He said it quietly , looking at them quietly , and went right on . " So may we all live and die honorably , each in his own time , " he said . " And now in closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Commander in Chief , has to say about our flag . " He pulled a white card from his pocket and read : " Alone of all flags , it represents the sovereignty of the people , which endures when all else passes away . Speaking with their voice , it has the sanctity of revelation . He who lives under it and is loyal to it is loyal to truth and justice everywhere . He who lives under it and is disloyal to it is a traitor to the human race everywhere . What could be saved , if the Flag of the American Nation were to perish ? " He sighed and put the card away . He seemed abruptly smaller and less intensely present . He went forward , walking rapidly and looking at no one . Bordelles took over to dismiss the formation . Afterward , the men stood around on the fantail . They were oddly quiet . Holman waited for someone to say something sarcastic . When men had been touched underneath , that was how they put themselves right again . Holman did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one started it . " Let 's go see what Big Chew 's fixing to feed us today , " Burgoyne proposed . He and Holman walked forward . The galley was built in above the83 The Sand Pebblesengine room on the port side . Its door opened on a triangular deck space that was the counterpart of the quarterdeck on the starboard side . One or both of the galley helpers , Small Chew and Jack Dusty , usually sat outside the door preparing vegetables . This morning it was Jack Dusty with red cabbage and green peppers . " Smells good , whatever it is , " Holman said . A swab was propped across the galley door . Holman peered in . It was a long , narrow space with a white tile deck . A sink , a worktable and a black coal range stood along the inboard side . The range had two nickeled oven doors and pots and skillets hung on the bulkhead above it . Big Chew was stirring some pots on the range top . He saw Holman and turned , waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said sharply . " Makee splice ! " Holman stepped back hastily . Big Chew was both fat and muscular under his white apron . He had a shaven bullet head and bold black eyes and a manner that said he knew he was boss in that galley . " Splice what ? " Holman asked Burgoyne . " The mainbrace ? " " He means surprise . We 're going to have a holiday dinner . " The two men stood back at the rail , sniffing the good smells . They heard the oven door click and slam closed and a hot , spicy smell drifted out to them . " Wonder what he 's making ? " Holman said . The Sand Pebbles did not have names for Big Chew 's dishes . No two of them were ever quite the same . They were all the best food Holman had ever eaten . He had already noted how the crew respected Big Chew . They would come to the galley and tell him how good the food was , but they would never think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any chow on here 's better than a holiday dinner in the Fleet , " Holman said . " Ai n't it the truth ! She 's a home and a feeder ! " Stawski and Ellis came up , sniffing , and Big Chew drove them off . Holman knew he was not going to feel like a thief when he ate that chow . The other men still did not mention the speech . Holman began to wonder if he was the only one disturbed by the speech . Richard McKenna 84All but Harris were quiet at dinner . Harris talked more loudly and obscenely than ever . Holman had always disliked foul talk at the mess table , and he had never once eaten a meal aboard any ship without it . The meal was baked ham and roast chicken , with vegetables and sauces , and the surprise was a special cake at the head of each table . The one between Holman and Farren was square , with white frosting , and decorated with a crude U.S. flag in red and blue sugar paste . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag Big Chew had put a Chinese character in red that meant good luck . " Pass the pronging chicken , " Harris said . " All we got here 's eating chicken , " Holman said . Harris scowled and reached a long arm for the chicken . " You know , just for today , Harris ought to talk clean , " Farren said . " You want the poor bastard to strangle ? " Wilsey said . " Only way he knows how to talk is dirty , " Burgoyne said . " Prong you and all your relations , Frenchy . " " You forgot my ancestors back to George Washington . " " Prong them three times , " Harris said . " All the way back to Miles Standish . " He had a long , lopsided chin that almost met his sharp nose when he had his false teeth out . He always turned his head sidewaysto bite at his food . " Harris learned all them words in his cradle , " Restorff said . " His mother spoke them words over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a long speech for Restorff . Suddenly , like a fire in dry grass , they were all ganging up on Harris . Harris felt it , and his coarse white hair seemed to bristle more wildly . " Harris never had a mother , " Farren said . " He was n't a baby . He was a pup or cub or something , " Holman said . " He was n't even born , " Wilsey said . " He just crawled up out of the bilges one day and put on a white hat . " Harris stopped eating . He glared at them and his wide slash mouth85 The Sand Pebblesgrinned at them like a shark . " Up all you bastards with a cargo hook , " he growled . " I can talk decent , when there 's any decent people to hear me . " " How do you know , if you never once tried ? " Farren said . " I 'll bet you ca n't . " " What 'll you bet ? How much ? " Harris thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ration of that cake . " " Bet money , you cheap bastard . " " We 'll all bet you our cake rations , " Wilsey said . " How about it , guys ? " They all nodded . " How about it , Harris ? " Wilsey said . " That 's five to one odds for you . That 's how sure we are you ca n't do it . " " Tell us a nice , clean sea story , " Burgoyne said . Harris slapped the table . " Maskee , I 'll do that ! I 'll show you God . . . blessed sailors ! " he said through his teeth . " Some of you maybe heard this story , but I was there and saw it happen . It was years ago , on the old . . . South Dakota . " They all grinned , as Harris narrowly avoided the obscene nicknamethey all used for that ship . " I had a kid striker in the electric gang , name of Arthur Lake , " Harris said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say . . . honey . . . if he had a mouthful . He had rosy cheeks and he wrote letters home and he kept his mother 's picture inside his locker door . He went ashore to the Y to swim and sing songs . He was always cleaning his fingernails and he stoled our battery water to brush his teeth when water hours was on . When he scrubbed his clothes he would n't hang ' em in the uptakes , like the rest of the black gang . Oh , my no ! He hung ' em topside with clothes stops , like the deck apes had to , because he said the sunlight made ' em smell clean and fresh . When he took a  --  I mean when he went to the head  --  he always used nine fathoms of . . . of . . . toilet paper ! " " Watch him sweat for them clean words , " Wilsey said . " Gettin ' ' em , ai n't I ? " Harris was eating again , chewing and talkingand glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in Shanghai Arthur and me and two watertenders was waiting for a sampan to come alongside so we could go ashore . ArthurRichard McKenna 86kept looking down to where his skivvy shirt crossed the V of his dress white jumper and he would pull his jumper out with his finger and sniff . I guess he liked the clean smell of himself . Well , we got a sampan , and the old woman sculling it wanted a dollar to put us ashore . The tide was running out very strong and we drifted a long way downriver before we could make her take forty cents . Then she landed us on the outboard side of a whole mess of barges and she was clear before we found out all the inboard boats was loaded honey barges . Of course the old . . . lady . . . done it on purpose . " " Jesus ! " Holman said . " Watch it , Holman ! You got to talk clean too , " Harris said . " I 'm sorry , " Holman said . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk a honey barge gunwale most times , " Harris resumed . " Only these all had dried mud dikes built up a foot high along the gunwales so they 'd hold more . And they was level full , all greenish-brown and covered with flies and bubbles rising and breaking in the hot sun . Me and the watertenders went across , but Arthur was afraid . We joshed him about it , and the slopeheads was all watching and laughing , like they always are , and finally Arthur started across . " Harris closed his eyes and threw back his head . " I can see him now . He come slow and careful and on his right that . . . stuff . . . was even with his shoe soles . It stunk so bad you could almost hear it stink and , I swear , it drew him . He had his arms out sideways and a awful look on his face and he 'd sway out over the stuff and then right himself and sway out over the water , and he was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his face was as white as his jumper . Then he started coming again and halfway across he fell into the stuff . He went clear out of sight under it . Then he come up all dripping and in one smooth motion , like a porpoise jumping , he went over the side into the river . We waved money and yelled Joe Min and the slopeheads hollered and looked all around , but them tide currents had Arthur , and nobody ever seen him again . " Harris opened his eyes and grinned sharkishly along the table . " There , by God ! I guess I proved to you bastards I can talk clean . " " You son of a bitch ! " Farren said . " You everlasting son of a87 The Sand Pebblesbitch ! You win , all right ! " He shoved the cake down in front of Harris . " We 're sorry we doubted you , Harris . We learned our lesson , " Wilsey said . " Now how about being a good shipmate and sharing that cake with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " Prong you hungry bastards . " Harris plunged his fork into the cake and lifted a chunk to his mouth . The cake was reddish-brown under the white frosting . " I 'll eat it all myself , " Harris said , chewing . " What I ca n't eat , I 'll spit on . " 6Show-the-flag cruising was very pleasant . They did not get underway until after quarters in the morning and they anchored before supper at night . Whenever he could , Lt. Collins anchored near a village or town and he would always spend several days at the walled cities . Hunan Province was hilly and green . There was the pale , feathery green of bamboo groves beside white farm compounds and the flat jade green of young rice fields and the glossy dark green of camphor and pomelo trees . In some places whole hillsides were pink and white with flowers and the breeze off those hills came fresh and pleasant across the decks of the San Pablo . Rocks and cliffs were olive green with moss and ferns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a huge pond with green , rocky islands in some places , and vast mudbank shallows and reed marshes in others , and clouds of white water birds that flew up screaming as the San Pablo thumped by their feeding grounds . In most places the lake had no definite shore , instead grading off into reed marsh , but near the Chien River the hills came right down to the lake , very steeply . They said the lake was really a big overflow basin for the rivers and it almost dried up in winter The currents ran brown along the drowned8889 The Sand Pebblesriver beds but in the shallows the mud settled out and the water was blue or green , depending on how the sunlight hit it . Breezes could roughen the water in little skipping dark spots here and there and a wind could roughen the whole surface and pick up a million glints from the sun , but there were no waves . It was very different from cruising on the ocean . The ocean was serious . The Chinese thought there were mermaids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and they were white porpoises . No one knew what porpoises were doing there , so far from the ocean . Probably the fresh water had bleached them . It was supposed to be bad luck to sight a white porpoise . The San Pablo passed many junks in the rivers and on the lake and swarms of sampans with men fishing or shrimp trapping , and there were mat huts and fishtraps all along the shores . Sometimes they passed long timber rafts with matshed villages on top of them and children playing around the huts . Occasionally they would meet H.M.S. Woodcock or the Japanese gunboat Hiro and then they would man the rail and exchange formal passing honors . They carried a Chinese pilot and much of the time in the lake he kept two deck coolies in the bow sounding with bamboo poles and singsonging water depths in high Chinese voices that blended with the bird screams . The lake was tricky . Sometimes they would see long-beaked herons wading and fishing only a hundred feet from the ship and that would be the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went the Chinese looked at them with a special unwinking , jaw-hanging kind of look . They gaped from junks and sampans on the lake and from their fields along the river banks , faces shadowed under conical bamboo hats , and from their creaking treadmillpumps that lifted river water to the fields . The treadmill coolies would turn facing the river , five or six abreast with their shoulders against the wooden bar , never breaking the rhythm of their creaking , endless climb . They would watch the San Pablo thump and waddle past them , high and white and blocky , smoke trailing from her single tall stack , and it was not possible to tell from their faces what they were thinking . People would come out of the walled cities to stand and watch or to move slowly along the stone-faced river bank , withRichard McKenna 90the same dumb looks . They would watch the Sand Pebbles at their musters and drills and calisthenics . For show-the-flag cruising , the bugling for drills and ship 's routine was done by all four Fangs at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not good enough to stay together on the calls . But loud bugling made military face in China and warlord armies in the walled cities seemed to bugle day and night . The San Pablo had to outbugle the warlords . It was not possible to guess from their faces what the Chinese thought about it all . There were some who watched without showing their faces . On the second day in the lake , passing a bluff headland , Holman heard Franks roar from the bridge : " All hands , take cover ! Clear port side ! " and a scatter of distant pops and the close-up hum of rifle bullets sent Holman running to the quarterdeck with his heart jumping . Stumpy Restorff was there beside the open arms locker , cleaning and oiling guns on a greasy hammock spread on deck . Ellis , the scarfaced seaman , was helping him . " It 's only a toofay salute , " Restorff told Holman . He was not excited . Bells jangled below and the fire doors clanged and the engine thud slowed . Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll try for a potshot from the galley windows , " he said . He left . Machine-gun fire crackled sharply from the bridge and then stopped . Pappy Tung and all the deck coolies had crowded into cover aft of the quarterdeck . " What 's toofay ? Who the hell 's shooting at us ? " Holman asked . " Toofay . Bandits , " Restorff grunted . The machine gun on the bridge cut loose again briefly and Ellis fired rapidly from the galley . After a long pause , the San Pablo 's whistle sounded . The little gunboat had a deep , hoarse whistle that would better have suited an ocean liner , and Burgoyne said it dropped the steam ten pounds every time they blasted it . Bells jangled again and the engine thud picked up and the deck coolies scattered back to their painting and scrubbing . Ellis came back with his rifle and a pot of steaming water. 91 The Sand Pebbles " Damn it , now I got to scald it out , " he said . " Thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " The San Pablo exchanged salutes with the toofay about once a week . Every town and district of Hunan was controlled by different groups of armed men . If they obeyed the treaties and did not interfere with treaty people , they were warlord troops . If they shot at gunboats and robbed such palefaces as they could catch , they were bandits . They all treated the civilian Chinese about the same , and that was not very well . Some of the minor warlords were supposed to be subordinate to the big warlord in Changsha , but for the most part each one was king in his own area . A great part of Lt. Collins ' job was dealing with warlords . Each steaming day Holman spent four hours on throttle watch , with Burgoyne tending water . He liked that , he and Burgoyne in dungarees and stripped to the waist , hand rags dangling from hip pockets and sweat towels around their necks , and the main-drive machinery talking and moving all around them . They steamed an easy five or six knots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was easy steaming . Too easy , Holman learned on his first watch . He kept the log and handled the throttle and Chien had charge of everything else . The old man moved all day between engine room and fireroom watching his coolies stoke furnaces and feel bearings and oil down and swab rods . When the low-pressure crank bearing ran hot it was Chien who gave it the emergency treatment with brown soap and water and came to the throttle station and told Holman he would have to slow the engine by ten revolutions . Chien had the only authority that counted , the authority to make decisions about the machinery and to carry them out . But Holman signed the log and he had the official responsibility . Old Chien could not have that , because he had no legal existence for the navy . Holman went to see Lynch . " I want a real steaming watch , " he said . " I know they got to be Chinamen , but I want the same ones each watch and I want to know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I can trust ' em . " " You can trust Chien . You see anything wrong before Chien does , Richard McKenna 92you just tell him , " Lynch said . " Hell , Jake , it 's easy as driving a car , way it is now . Why look for trouble ? " " Because I feel like a dummy down there , " Holman said . The throttle was the honor point . No Chinese was permitted to touch the throttle . But in effect they had everything else , and it was a stupid honor . Holman wrangled carefully with Lynch , not revealing all that he felt . " All right , I 'll settle for one man , to be my oiler on the main engine , " he said at last . " That coolie , Po-han . Reckon that 'd hurt old Chien 's feelings too much ? " " I 'll talk to Chien , " Lynch said . Chien gave in on Po-han , but he did n't like it . It was all unofficial , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was seldom . Scuttlebutt sprang up that Holman and Chien were feuding . That was probably Perna 's work , Holman thought . Perna was a sly bird . He and Wilsey and Stawski stood their watches in the old way , often one man tending both throttle and feed checks while the other was cooling off topside . Perna pretty well led Stawski , the big , stupid fireman , on a leash . There was one other fireman , a kid named Waxer , who did not stand steaming watches . He was a striker to Harris and also to Waldhorn , the radioman . One of Chien 's coolies named Chiu-pa seemed to do all the electrical work . Holman began to like Burgoyne . He was mild and easy-going , willing to let Chien run the fireroom , where Burgoyne was in charge on paper , but he sympathized with Holman 's desire for more control in the engine room . The throttle station was a brightly lighted angle formed by the log desk , with the gauge board up behind it , and the forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the engine room . Burgoyne would stand there , drooping his lean , tattooed weight by one hand from an overhead valve wheel , legs crossed , smoothing his drooping mustache with his free hand , under lip bulging with the Copenhagen which he spat at intervals into the trash bucket beside the log desk . He was a simple , pleasant , unhurriedman and a good watchmate . Sometimes he would sit on an upended bucket , elbows on knees . Holman invariably stood balanced93 The Sand Pebbleseasy and ready on both feet , watching the many-formed motions of the engine and listening to all the machinery sounds , even as he talked . Po-han ranged along the engine and back into the shaft alley on his oiling duties , and he was always coming to the throttle station to ask questions . Po-han was afire to learn . " I swear , Jake , Po-han 's the little image of you , " Burgoyne said one day . " Same square build and all the muscles , only his skin 's darker . " Burgoyne looked from Holman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear it ! Stands like you and cocks his head the same  --  Jake , he 's studying to ape you . " " Let him , " Holman said . " He 'll be a good engineer . " Po-han 's English got better every day . He was still linking up all the little magics into the big magic and he wanted to learn names . May . . . stim . . . stah . . . wowel ! he would say , for main steam stop valve , his eyes shining with joy in a new name learned . He was fitting what he learned into a very weird scheme of his own that Holman drew out of him one afternoon on watch . Po-han spoke as much of it as he could and acted out the rest . They laughed , watching him , and Po-han laughed too , because they were all friends . To Po-han , the engine was a metal dragon . The dragon ate steam and excreted exhaust steam to the condenser . The air pump and feed pumps were metal coolies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boilers were the fields and the stoker coolies out there were farmers who had captive suns in their furnaces . They were continuously raising a crop of steam which Holman , as throttleman , continuously harvested and fed to the dragon . It was honorable to be a steam farmer , but the greatest honor was to attend the dragon and massage his limbs and oil his joints . Po-han was very pleased and excited by his scheme . " Who 'd ever guess he was thinking like that , watching him work ? Pure wonders you , do n't it ? " Burgoyne shook his head . " Steam farm . The sun in a cage . " He laughed . " You could sure God get sunburned by them suns , all right . " " It ai n't just funny , " Holman said . " He 's got to make it hang to- gether best way he can . Do n't you , Po-han ? " He slapped the coolie'sRichard McKenna 94shoulder and grinned at him . " You know , Frenchy , coal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took sun to grow it . When you burn coal , it 's like turning that sunlight loose again . When you blister your arm on a steam valve , you really are sunburned , in a way of figuring . " " A funny way of figuring . I 'll have to study that . " " It is , Frenchy , you think it through . " The notion was exciting Holman . He pointed to the electric light above them . " That 's million- year-old sunlight , " he said . " You 're bad as Po-han , " Burgoyne said . " How do you guys think up stuff like that ? " He grinned and spat in the trash bucket . " Steam farms . I 'll have to tell Perna that . " " No . Perna 'd make a nasty joke out of it , " Holman said . " Po-han trusts us , to tell us things like that . " " You 're right . I wo n't tell Perna . " Through all their steaming watches Chien 's coolies worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching everything . He always wore his shiny black , close-buttoned jacket and he never had sweat on his bony face . Holman seldom spoke to him and he often felt the old man 's hostile eyes on the back of his neck . It would be no use to ask old Chien what scheme he had to hang the plant together . Probably he did not have a scheme , Holman thought , and he did not want to see Po-han gain one . Whatever the reason , Chien neither liked nor trusted Holman and Po-han . Holman found some eighth-inch copper tubing and wound it into a steam coil and hooked it into the back pressure line to the feed heater . I-Ic got a gray enamel pitcher and some mess cups from Wong and began making engine room coffee . The smell of the coffee , added to the odors of hot oil , hot metal and scorched rubber packing , made the engine room smell right to him for the first time . You always put a big pinch of salt into a pot of engine room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt you lost in sweating . It gave the coffee a special flat , oily kind of taste . " This is right good , " Burgoyne said , tasting his first cup of it . " I like to forgot how black gang coffee tasted . " 95 The Sand PebblesAt first the other watch would not make any coffee . They kept on sending to the galley for it . Po-han did not drink any of it , because Chinese did not like coffee and because it was strictly against old custom for them to use crew 's mess gear . Even when Wong and Clip Clip ate leftovers from the crew 's mess , they always used chopsticks and tin pieplates . One morning Lynch sniffed the coffee smell from above and came down for a cup . " Ai n't smelled that for years , " he said . " Makes me hungry for a cup . " He sipped at it . " Ai n't no coffee like shaft alley coffee , " he said . On other ships all the engineers believed that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also began brewing and drinking engine room coffee . The summer cruising shook Holman down to the ship 's routine . There were the daily drills and musters . Every Friday there was lowerdeckinspection . Lt. Collins and Bordelles and the chiefs , all in white , walked through the engine room and fireroom with old Chien hovering along in their wake to take their praise of how clean and shipshape it all was . They never asked how well it ran . Saturdays they had personnel inspection and Holman hated that as much as he always had . It was really no strain . The compartment coolies shined shoes the night before and laid out clean uniforms in the morning and Oh Joy always made a great chattering fuss about each man looking just right before he went out . It was the simple standing there and being looked at like a thing that Holman hated . After personnel inspectioncame inspection of topside and living spaces . It was a royal progress of Lt. Collins through the ship , accompanied by Bordelles and the chiefs , the Red Dog to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lead to bugle attention when they came to a place , and another Fang in the rear to bugle carry on when they left it . Holman had to stand by the quarterdeck arms locker for topside inspection . They never inspected the Chinese living quarters , in the old iron hull of the ship , below the main deck . About every ten steaming days they coaled ship , usually from Chinese barges . Chanting coolies streamed aboard with the coal inRichard McKenna 96flat baskets on top of their heads and dumped it down the deck scuttles . Other coolies below in the bunkers leveled and trimmed and the work went fast . The San Pablo had one thwartship and two wing bunkers , boxing in the fireroom , and they held about ninety tons . Lynch always took Chien 's word for tonnage and quality . " Chien 's the guy that 's got to burn it , he 'll look out for slate , " Lynch told Holman . " Do n't worry about it . " Bordelles would pay whatever Lynch said to pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze that paid all the coolies . Bordelles always paid in silver Mex dollars because they did not trust paper money in Western I lunan . There were no banks there , and Bordelles had to carry enough silver for the whole summer . They said he always left Hankow with his bathtub so full of silver dollars he could not take a bath until the Fourth of July . As soon as the coal was aboard , Pappy Tung and his deck coolies would go after the coal dust with hoses , scrubbers and rags , and in an hour or two the San Pablo would be as brass-gleaming white as ever . Payday was every other week and it involved more of the things Jake Holman did not like . Bordelles knew every man in the crew , yet he had to countersign each pay receipt as witness of the man 's signatureand then watch each man put his fingerprints on the back of his pay receipt to prove that he was really the man he was pretending to be . They had to file past the mess table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , and the only other place you had to carry your hat that way was in officers ' country . Welbeck and Bordelles , wearing pistols , sat in Burgoyne 's and Harris ' places at the mess table , and behind them Duckbutt Randall , also armed , guarded a dishpan full of reserve Mex dollars in brown paper rolls . Lop Eye Shing sat next to Bordelles , in Farren 's place , to collect each man 's coolie bill . The first payday was Holman 's first sight of Lop Eye Shing . He was tall and robust , with a big nose for a Chinese , and he did not look as old as he must have been . His paralysis gave his face a sad , sinister look , the left eyelid drooping  --  that was why they called him Lop Eye  --  and the left corner of his mouth drooped . The right side of his face was firm and bold . He talked good English , slurring some97 The Sand Pebbleswords , and when he talked little flickers of life ran through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught . He had a deep voice for a Chinese and he always wore a black skull cap and a gray gown and he walked with a gold-mounted cane . It was very plain that the other coolies were afraid of him . Shing collected a lump sum that covered laundry and barber and tailor bills and tips for Wong and Oh Joy , and it came to about ten percent of each man 's pay . No one ever asked for a breakdown . Shing dumped the dollars clinking into a basket on deck beside the table and they made quite a heap when it was all there . Then Clip Clip and Oh Joy would carry the basket aft and down to the Chinese quarters while Shing shuffled behind them with his cane . After payday the men who did not have liberty would gamble , rolling dice or playing blackjack , and sometimes poker . Restorff was usually the big winner . When they were not steaming , Holman took his regular turn at quarterdeck watches . He learned to stand them well , disliking them but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarterdeck , and at times it was interesting . The big event each day at anchor was when the chow came aboard . Big Chew would go over to market , importantly in a gray silk gown and carrying a fan and parasol . At the walled cities , he would always have a sedan chair to carry him , while Small Chew or Jack Dusty ran alongside . Having selected the food , Big Chew would come back alone and shortly afterward his helper and the market people would bring the food down . The food had to be inspected on the quarterdeck and the Sand Pebbles liked to gather and watch it and speculate on how it would taste . Jennings , the pharmacist 's mate , inspected the food . He took all his responsibilities very seriously and he was never known to laugh . He was a blond man with close-clipped hair and a rosy face and large , solemn pink eyes behind steel-rimmed glasses . He would kneel and look at the profusion of fruits and leafy vegetables in straw and wicker baskets and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wash all this very thoroughly in permanganate solution , " he would say . Then Jennings would stare dubiously at the meat , usually pork andRichard McKenna 98chicken , poke it , smell of it , and make fussy worry-sounds . " Chew , you must cook this meat very , very thoroughly , " he would say . Big Chew never washed anything in permanganate , but he cooked it all Chinese fashion and no one ever got sick . The San Pablo did not have refrigeration and , except for dry stores , they had to live off the country . Away from Hankow the food was almost wholly Chinese . It was roast duck and chicken and pork and ham cut up small and sweet little shrimps stewed or boiled or fried with rice and all manner of vegetables and spicy , gingery sauces . Every meal was different and each one was an experience to remember . Bordelles always paid without question whatever Big Chew said it cost , and that was another big source of squeeze . " Who cares , so long as Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Welbeck would say . Big Chew kept the troops happy , all right . After every meal someoneor other was certain to lean back and pat his stomach and say , " I ca n't give her much on liberty , but by God she 's a home and a feeder ! " He would be speaking for all of them . She could not be very much on liberty in Western Hunan , because there were no treaty ports with bars and whorehouses for the ocean devils . Off duty , the Sand Pebbles flaked out in their bunks or played cribbage and acey-deucey at the mess tables or stood on deck and stared back at the Chinese . Out in the lake , they sometimes went ashore to explore islands or hunt or fish through the mud flats and the reed marshes . There were millions of birds , but they lost most of those they shot , and they were always talking about getting a ship 's dog . They could go ashore sightseeing in the walled cities , but they had a rigid rule not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tame as the treaty port coolies and there were no Sikh cops to keep them in line . The old walled cities interested Holman . They lay along the rivers , with a paved bund and flights of stone steps leading down from it to the water . The walls were old and crumbling and gray , with99 The Sand Pebblesembrasured parapets , but with lines of laundry flapping up there instead of knights in armor . The gate houses had heavy , curving tiled roofs , like temples . All day long files of water coolies yo-hoed and slopped their way up the steps from the river with wooden buckets of water at the end of carrying poles , because the cities had no other water system . They had no electricity either , and the only lights at night were bobbing paper lanterns . They did not even have rickshaws . People who rode inside the cities had to ride jouncing in sedan chairs carried by coolies who never stopped screaming for gangway . Holman liked to walk through the narrow , crowded streets of open-front shops and stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the clean smell of camphorwood , chopstick splitting with the smell of varnish , the beating out of silver into the thin foil they used to make money for dead people in an endless shower of hammer tinks . The Chinese stared back at Holman , and he was a show to them . He wandered long , smelly , stone-paved streets narrow enough to span with his arms and roofed into dim tunnels with bamboo and matting . He always went into the temples and stared back at the fierce guard-gods with black beards and glaring eyes , and he nodded at the fat , calm Buddhas and smiled back at the gravely smiling Kwan Yins . He always left his money in Kwan Yin 's offering box . He was struck again and again with the thought that up until now he had never really been in China , but only in the treaty ports , which were a kind of bastard China . Sometimes in the cities he would meet other palefaces , walking or in chairs , and they would pretend not to see each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thought sailors set bad examples and cut down the local recruiting for Jesus , and the scuttlebutt was that they wanted all the gunboats taken clear out of China . Ensign Bordelles always had to call on the missionaries and see if they were having any trouble . Lt. Collins would not see them unless he had to . But he always called on the local warlords and went to their feasts and invited them and their staffs aboard the San Pablo for dinner in the wardroom . They would come down to the ship inRichard McKenna 100chairs , some wearing civilian gowns and some in uniform , and the Sand Pebbles always put on a smart show of saluting and bugling . Big Chew would feed their enlisted bodyguard outside the galley . Warlord soldiers never looked very military . They were scrawny men in sleazy gray cotton uniforms and straw sandals , and in full kit they would have a teapot hung from their belts and a paper parasol . It was commonknowledge that they never fought battles , but only made a great looksee pidgin of yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real battle with silver bullets . The San Pablo carried a locked storeroom full of beer in brown quart bottles , bought with the welfare fund . Several evenings each week Oh Joy would hire a sampan or wupan to lie alongside and the liberty men would go down into it to drink beer , because it was against regulation to drink beer aboard . They had to pay Oh Joy for the beer , and the profit went into the general coolie fund . Oh Joy would keep the beer in a tub with gunny sacks and pour river water over it to cool it as much as he could . He was a spry , dry , chattering old Chinaman with big yellow front teeth , and he looked like a wise , wicked old rabbit . Every payday they would have what Jennings called a " biological . " They always arranged to be at one of the walled cities , and Holman 's first one was at Changteh on the Yuan River , when he was still restrictedfrom the Hankow trouble . Oh Joy and Clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk came alongside right after breakfast . Urills went sloppily that morning because the Sand Pebbles were trying to catch glimpses of the women and they were all kidding Jennings . Ile would go aboard the junk and take smears and paint iodine numbers on their bellies so nobody could switch them on him when he came back to run his clap tests in the San Pablo sick bay . It would have been easier to bring the women to the sick bay , but there was a regulation against that . The Sand Pebbles always accused Jennings of turning down the young , pretty ones and keeping the old and ugly ones with bound feet . Excitement would build up and just before dinner Red Dog Shanahan would always put on the same act in the open space by101 The Sand Pebblesthe barber chair , which they called the bull ring . Red Dog would sketch out with gestures a woman on the deck and pretend to be Jennings examining her . Here now , down with the trousers , he would say , pulling them down , and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would paint the iodine number on the imaginary belly with pursed lips and sweeping flourishes . Sometimes the woman did n't understand and the Red Dog would assure her that it was only doctor pidgin . Then he would poke and prod and sniff and squint and wrinkle his nose and make worry noises , exactly as Jennings always did when he examined meat on the quarterdeck . The Sand Pebbles at the mess tables would hush laughing as Crosley began sneaking up behind the Red Dog . Crosley would wait until the Red Dog had his head right down in there and then he would make to push it while they all held their breaths and , after a few false starts , he would push it . The Red Dog would pretend his head was caught and he would lunge and buck and strangle while everybody roared . Finally he would get his head out and then reach in after his imaginary glasses and begin wiping them off . " Crosley , " he would say solemnly , " you must be sure to prong this meat very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh of all . At Changteh , when dinner was finished , Franks sounded his bosun 's pipe on the quarterdeck and passed the word : " Awa-a-ay boarders ! " The liberty men climbed across to the foredeck of the junk , where there was room for Clip Clip tending a tub of beer and room to roll dice for drinks . They also rolled to see who went first on the women and who took wet decks , and there was much laughing and despairing and arguing . The junk was the middle-sized kind , with three cabins in the low deckhouse amidships and a narrow walkway along each side . Oh Joy squatted on top of the deckhouse and collected two dollars from each man who entered one of the low , sliding doors . There was a standing argument about which was best , to keep going back to the best-looking girl or to take each in turn . Crosley , Ellis , Stawski and Perna formed what they called the Clean Sweep Club , and the last one to make a clean sweep had to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men stood along the bulwark and watched enviously . When one of the liberty men had enough , he could come back aboard and stand by for a duty man , and before the day ended all hands except the restricted men had a crack at it . For the first one , Holman was glad that he was still restricted . The junk was hired for the day by Oh Joy and the women were from someplace on the beach ; the people who owned the junk and lived aboard it stayed inside the stern castle . Twice a little boy got out and wanted to play on deck and his mother scolded him and dragged him howling back inside . Wong kept handing more beer across to Clip Clip and taking the empties aboard . They were singing and having a very good time on the junk . The best-looking girl was in the center cabin and she got most of the repeat trade . Late in the afternoon she began crying and wailing inside the cabin and shortly afterward Bronson came out and went forward . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry like that ? " Harris asked Bronson . " You ai n't hung as heavy as all that . " " She dropped her shoe in the piss pot , " Bronson said . " Hell of a thing to bawl about , ai n't it ? " She was still crying inside there when the junk pulled away , after evening colors . It cut down her trade a lot , but Oh Joy climbed down off the deckhouse with a whole sack full of Mex dollars . Clip Clip had a smaller sack full , from the beer . The profits from the biologicals went into the general coolie fund . In spite of the comforts and interests topside and ashore , Holman still loved the engine . On a steaming watch he would often lose the thread of Burgoyne 's talk as his eyes and ears drifted off into the engine , into the maze of oil-shining brass and steel higher than a man 's head and twenty feet long and all in whirling , stroking , rocking , lawful motion . The three piston rods stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the crossheads to bend like giant knees . The crossheads drove the conn rods like thick legs striding and the cranks went round and round like ponderous feet and ankles . Beside each crank , driven by it , the twinned eccentrics jigged their diverging rods to each end of the rucking , overarching link bars , which in103 The Sand Pebblesturn drove slender valve spindles back into the cylinder casting to measure and control the flow of power to the cranks . It was all flowing power , tons of sculptured metal in cyclical , patterned motion , and the light played through it in a pattern of rhythmic gleam and shadow . The manifold , repeating sounds of it flowed into Holman 's ears . The vibrations came in through his hands and feet and the smell of steam and hot oil and burnt packing filled his nostrils . It was all inside of him in a pattern of blood-pulse and nerve-thrill . Then he knew the engine was a blind , bolted-down giant doing a tireless three-legged dance . On his starboard side the main circulator chuck-chuck-chucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes , and on his port side the main air pump plunged and wheezed and gasped , starting the condensed steam on its way back to the boilers . Aft and away , whirling whitely through spring bearings and the squat thrust block , the shaft ran into the gloom of its long tunnel . Holman was tuning his ears to hear the individual sound of each working part of the engine and of each pump and , while he talked absently to Burgoyne , he would practice picking each one out separatelywith his ears . Within a few watches he had added an ear picture to the eye picture already inside his head , and he could make an inspection tour of the engine room with his ears alone , without leaving the throttle station . Whatever was going wrong , he would know it . That faculty with his ears was what had made men on other ships think Jake Holman had black magic with machinery . He began teaching it to Po-han . He was increasingly pleased with how Po-han could learn . The eager young coolie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , Po-han knew how to explore the room for himself . He was always surprising Holman with how much he had learned . Burgoyne praised Po-han and took pride in him too , because they were all watchmates . Holman 's ear picture was ugly because of the thud in the lowpressurecrank bearing . Something was wrong with the L.P. and old Chien and his coolies had to refit the bearing about every five steamingdays . The first day it would run almost quiet , but also hot , havingRichard McKenna 104to be nursed with soapy water and oil flooding and reducing speed until it wiped itself enough clearance to run easy . But then would begin the muted thud each time the great crank came round , and the shiver that ran dumbly through the ship . By the fourth day the thud would be loud and jarring and , to Holman , dangerous , although no one else minded it . Then Chien would refit it again . Chien did not want Holman to watch the bearing work . He and his coolies would hunch over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not often that Holman 's topside military duties gave him time even to try to watch . Chien never asked Holman to inspect and approvea bearing job or any other repair job . He would get anyone else who had paper authority , even Stawski , rather than Jake Holman . It irked Holman to see a stupid fireman like Stawski gravely inspectingand approving a job he could not possibly have done himself . Holman ached to refit the L.P. crank bearing with his own hands , coolie work or no . He was sure that after a few such refits he would begin to see a wear pattern that might tell him what was wrong . " It has to be out of alignment some way , " he told Lynch one day . They were drinking coffee at the throttle station . " That thump 's been in there for twenty years and nobody 's ever been able to take it out , " Lynch said . " It ai n't alignment . I 've seen that engine in dockyard stripped to the soleplate with piano wire through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I bet I could take out that thump , or else find out exactly why I ca n't , " Holman said . " There ai n't no mysteries about machinery . " " Big talk , Jake . " " Give me a chance to prove it , Chief . " " Oh hell , old as this ship is , ready for the scrap heap when they commission the new ones  --  " Lynch gestured impatiently and spilled his coffee . He was irritated . " Let old Chien handle it . Hell , she steams , do n't she ? " " Chien 'll keep her steaming , " Burgoyne said . " He always has . " Holman dared not press it , because Lynch had already cautionedhim several times about cutting in on Chien . The old man had beencomplaining . Scuttlebutt persisted that Holman and Chien were105 The Sand Pebblesfeuding . Yet all that Holman did was to walk around on steaming watch inspecting , and learning the plant with his ears , and teaching Po-han . Chien did n't want anybody to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise only paper authority while Chien himself kept the real authority , the only kind of authority that the machinery acknowledged , and the only kind that was real to Jake Holman . Chien was always around , working his coolies , and his blank old face and stiff shoulders expressed disapproval whenever Holman left the throttle station . Po-han would not talk about Chien . He was very much afraid of Chien . Holman sometimes worried that Chien might strike at Po-han , who was a very junior coolie . But Chien struck in other ways . Small things began to go wrong on watch . Holman would pick them up with his ears as often as with his eyes and go directly to the trouble and set it right . Then he would show Po-han , and that was how he struck back at Chien . It was a feud , but a very strange one . Once the vacuum began dropping , which meant an air leak , and Holman 's ears picked up the tiny , trilling whisper clear across the engine room and through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve on the air pump suction line , which had probably been a gauge connection many years ago . Holman went to it and reached under the floorplates and closed it in one sure motion , without even looking to find it . Then he rose and turned to meet Chien 's stare . The old man 's yellowed teeth were bared , and his face expressedpure terror . Often on a steaming watch Holman would lean with his hands on the protecting handrail and watch the L.P. crank as it thumped around . He knew there was misalignment , whatever Lynch said , and he hoped he might spot it with his eyes . He would watch the ton of moving metal sweep out its thirty-inch circle , half its orbit above the floorplates and half down in the crankpit , like rolling day and night . He could not spot anything . But his ears picked up an almost inaudible whispering . It seemed to shift and vary and came from everywhere at once . His ears could not pin it down and identify it . It was a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him something . Richard McKenna 106He would stand there for long minutes straining to interpret it . Then he would feel the hair bristle on the back of his neck and he would turn and Chien would be looking at him with that flat , bony old stare . One morning in mid-August a white porpoise crossed their bow . An hour later they got orders from Comyang in Hankow to go at once to Paoshan on the Chien River , where antiforeign riots were supposed to be in progress . They were already on their way to Paoshan and all it meant was raising speed to the maximum of eight knots , which would get them to Paoshan in late afternoon instead of next day . No one was very excited . The drill that morning was landing force , and they rolled full packs . Holman was in Bordelles ' section , with Farren as squad leader and Crosley , Shanahan , Ellis and Tullio as squadmates . They fell in on the fantail and it was the same as always , Bordelles inspecting gear and arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the water was clean and fresh . Then he went to the bridge to report . " Farren , you figure we really got to go ashore and shoot somebody ? " Holman asked . He wanted them to show the same tension that he was feeling . " Not shoot , " Farren said . " The warlord 'll stop it . Maybe General Pan 's men will have to shoot . " They all explained to Holman . Warlords sometimes had reasons for107Richard McKenna 108not stopping riots , but when they could save face by blaming it on a gunboat , they would usually stop them . They would explain to the people that if they did not more gunboats would come and kill everybody . Just the presence of the San Pablo moored under the wall with its flag and guns would probably calm Paoshan right down , Farren said . " They 're beating up native Christians and looting ' em , " Crosley said . " Likely Pan was n't squeezing enough protection money and he just wanted to put the fear of Christ in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , but what if he wo n't stop it ? Or ca n't ? " " Then we 'll stop it , " Farren said . " But how do you stop a riot ? " " Walk at ' em with guns , " Crosley said . " If they do n't give ground , fire over their heads . Then they 'll break and run . " " They 'll be howling in Chinese , " the Red Dog said . " You wo n't understand it , Jake , but what they 'll be yelling is : Here comes the great and terrible Red Dog Shanahan ! Run for your lives and hide all your virgins ! ' " " Hide all their samshu , " Ellis said . " Arf ! Arf ! " " No , but God damn it , I mean , what if they shoot back ? " Holman persisted . " Come at us ? " Farren shrugged . " We 'll make the best fight we can . We 'll mow the bastards like hay , while we last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly seriously they took all the drills that were only an irksome make-believe to him . He still did not believe he was to going to shoot anyone , or be shot at . He looked across the rail at the river and the green , swampy delta land from which white birds were flying upward screaming . He did not want to look at their faces . He did not know these shipmates of his . " Hell , do n't talk like that , Jake , " Tullio said . " They wo n't come at us . " They 'll run , " Crosley said . " Slopeheads always run . " " Silence in ranks ! " Bordelles had come back to dismiss them. 109 The Sand Pebbles " Chief Franks ' section will go ashore with the captain , " he said . " We 'll stand by in reserve aboard . Leave your packs and your guns on your bunks . " It was just like any other drill to all of them but Holman . When Holman took the steaming watch after dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse than Holman had ever heard it . The greater power was wiping and poundingthe soft metal more rapidly , and the more the clearance increased the worse it pounded , and it was like a snowball rolling downhill . At one o'clock Holman sent for Lynch . " Chief , we got to stop and take some clearance out of that bearing , " he told Lynch . " I heard it that bad before . " Lynch was scornful . " We only got about three more hours . " " She wo n't make it . " " Chien says she will . I already told the skipper she will . " Lynch went up angry . The knock became worse . It took on a sharp , bone-thudding quality that made the floorplates chatter and the wrenches behind the workbench jump in their hangers . Old Chien hovered near the L.P. , watching it narrowly . He was acting worried . So were Po-han and Burgoyne worried , and Holman 's nerves fined to a wire edge . At two o'clock he sent for Lynch again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm going to cut to half speed . " " Make your turns . " " She 's about to carry away , Chief , " Holman said . " She 'll blow a head and scald us . She 'll flail the rod through the bottom and sink the Goddamned ship ! " He reached for the fireroom annunciator . " I 'm going to slow down . " Lynch blocked his hand . " No , you ai n't ! Make your turns ! By God , that 's a military order ! " He was frowning and his lips were pooching in and out . He was angry and afraid too , and he was being stubborn . " Put that in writing ! " They had to shout at each other above the engine racket . " Put that on paper , with your name under it , andRichard McKenna 110I 'll do it , " Holman shouted . Lynch shook his head . " Okay , then , take this throttle ! " Holman yelled . " You and Chien can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Come on , Frenchy ! " He made to leave and Lynch stopped him . " We 'll secure , " he said , and walked around the engine . " Chien ! Burn down your fires ! " he yelled at the old man . " Pretty soon makee stop . " Lynch went up and Chien went to the fireroom . Holman began easing in the throttle . Lynch came back down with Lt. Collins , who looked angry and impatient . Chien came back and his coolies laid out wrenches and a sledge . The job would not take very long . Wilsey and Perna and Stawski came down in whites and drifted around . They wanted to make a show of concern and being useful , because the captain was down there . When the steam was low enough they anchored . It seemed very quiet , with the jarring thud stopped . Holman stayed at the throttle to position the L.P. crank , which would have to be at top center . The control lever worked a small reversing engine that could slide the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main engine and hold them at any point . When they were in mid-position the three slide valves were supposed to be closed and the engine stopped . But the valves leaked and , even with the steam shut off at the throttle , air leaked up the piston rods to create a pressure imbalancewith the vacuum in the condenser , and the engine would still run . It would lie quiet until enough air leaked in and then it would suddenly jump , one way or the other . To hold the L.P. on top , Holman had to keep jiggling the lever very slightly across midposition . The tremor of the control lever was magnified to an oscillationof several inches in the links and the great crank rolled ahead and checked and back and checked and Holman held the engine rocking there , all the trembling tons of it instantly responsive to his hand , and it felt like an extension of his own bone and muscle . He was showing Chien how well he could control the engine . Then they put in the jacking gear , pinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft , and the engine was in a secure mechanical111 The Sand Pebbleslock . Holman locked the control in mid-position and went around to watch the job . The crank was still trying to roll . It was working through the backlash of the jacking gear with sharp clicks each way , but the gear held it . The crank bearing was like a beer barrel split lengthwise and clamped around the crankpin with two big bolts on each side . They would have to back off the nuts enough to drop the bottom half slightly and take out a thin metal shim from each side and reduce clearance , and then slug the nuts up tight once more . It was emergencyprocedure and the coolies were not used to it . They were all afraid to get down into the crankpit and hold the wrench . Chien shrilled at them and they screamed back . " Why do n't they begin , Lynch ? " Lt. Collins asked . " You told me ten minutes . " " I 'll get down there and hold the wrench , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lench ! " Chien did not want to lose face by working , but even more he did not want Jake Holman getting in on any repair job . He took off his black satin jacket , to keep it clean , and his bony old man 's chest was hairless and smooth and showed every rib . He climbed down and held the wrench and the work went fast . The heavy-set coolie named Chiu-pa swung the sledge . When the shims were out he slugged the nuts up full due again and Chien handed out the wrench . Chien was tightening the set screws that locked the nuts when the crank came grinding at him with a high , dry squeal . Holman flew to the control lever . He heard the one great scream as the crank crushed the old man 's chest and drove his air out , and then he had the crank checked and trembling back on top center . Chien slid down out of sight , to the bottom of the crankpit . They were all running and yelling now . Lt. Collins started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prying up a floorplate . They were going to go into the bilges and pull Chien out through the manhole in the soleplate and that would twist and wrench hell out of the broken old man . Richard McKenna 112 " Lynch , come here ! " Holman yelled . " God damn you , Lynch , come here ! " Lynch came . He was pale and staring . Holman pulled Lynch 's hand to the control lever . " Hold her on top ! " he said , and ran . Chien was doubled over flat in the crankpit , head between legs . Holman straddled him in the slippery oil and water and reached between his own legs to grasp the skinny arms at the shoulders . He straightened up , lifting Chien carefully , and the crank kept nudging the back of his head with short , dry squeals . Lynch could not hold it as steady as Holman had . Lt. Collins leaned down to take Chien from Holman , and the old man 's face passed an inch away from Holman 's face . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no expression in the eyes . Chien 's mouth was open and bubbly blood came out of it and his chest was all torn and bloody . Jennings was on the floorplates with blankets and a stretcher , and when Holman climbed out of the crankpit they were already carrying Chien up the ladder . Holman looked at Lt. Collins . Neither spoke . They both had blood on them . Holman knelt and took out the jacking gear . He could see that the shaft had turned inside the worm wheel . He stood up again and he was beginning to shake . " I guess we can get underway now , sir , " he said . Lt. Collins seemed to jerk . " Yes . Yes , we can , " he said . He went up the ladder and Holman went around to the throttle . Lynch 's face was working and he had tears in his eyes . " I would n't trust you to hold it , " he kept saying , half to himself . " Nobody had time to think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess I 'll go stand by the sickbay , see about old Chien , " Lynch said . He went up . He would stop for a slug of rum first , Holman knew . They were all clearing out , even the coolie work gang . Holman started to open the throttle bypass , to let warming steam into the engine , and found it already open . He knew he had closed it . His arm113 The Sand Pebblesmuscles remembered closing it . But it was open , and that steam might have been just the extra push . . . It shook Holman . He did n't know what to do . Finally he pretended to open it , and he did not think Burgoyne noticed . They got underway and the L.P. still thumped , but it would take them to Paoshan . Burgoyne had to keep going out to the fireroom to check the stoker coolies , because Chien would not be doing that any more . Po-han did his oiling and tending , but he walked wide as he could of the L.P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " God damn it ! You know , just God damn it all to hell ! Poor old Chien , " and then he packed his lip nervously with snuff . They worked up to eight knots and moored to the Paoshan pontoon at about five o'clock , and Lt. Collins went ashore with Franks ' landing force section while Pappy Tung was still doubling up lines . Holman ate a late supper in dungarees and came out on deck . Bordelles told him to bear a hand and shift uniform and fall in with the reserve landing section . Farren and the others were already standing by under arms on the quarterdeck . Lynch was there , with the OOD duty . " I got to repair the jacking gear and refit a crank bearing , " Holman said . " The bilge coolies will do that , " Bordelles said . " I do n't think they can , without Chien , " Holman said . " What do you think , Chief ? " " I do n't know about them other ones , how much they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Mr. Bordelles . " " Why ca n't you do that ? " " Got the duty . " Lynch slapped his pistol . " Well . . . all right . " Bordelles did n't like it . Holman told Po-han to round up four coolies and put them to unbolting the big L.P. cylinder cover and wiping out the crankpit . He and Po-han repaired the jacking gear . The worm wheel fit over a collar on the shaft and it was meant to be locked in place by two square keys . Both keys were gone . One had been gone a long timeRichard McKenna 114and paint was so thick over the empty keyway that it was hard to tell it was even there . The other key had worked out with the jarring vibration that day , and nothing but rust had been holding the worm wheel when old Chien had gotten down into the crankpit and trusted his life to it . That was how it was with machinery , and Holman explained it to Po-han . If you were sloppy and ignorant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't matter how well you meant or how pure your heart was . But if you knew how and did take care of machinery , you were safer than you were in church . Old Chien was still alive up in the sickbay , holding on like a cat , Jennings said , and they would try to get a missionary doctor for him . But old Chien was through in the San Pablo engine room . " My sabby , Jehk , " Po-han said solemnly . Holman found keystock in the rack under the workbench and they cut and fitted two new keys . With a light chisel , Holman upset the collar and gear metal over each end of each key , to hold them in place no matter how much the shaft vibrated . When they had more time , they would put a countersunk machine screw through each key , he told Po-han . Po-han nodded eagerly . He understood the principle . Holman watched the four coolies work . They were suddenly friendly and anxious to please him , instead of being hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind of contact with them that he had with Po-han . They knew the job . They made up their beam clamps solidly and ran their eyebolts all the way in and they were clever riggers with their slings and chainfalls . They lifted aside the big cylinder cover and hoisted the piston and rod assembly and they walked the two bearing halves out on the floorplates very nicely . Chiu-pa seemed to have charge of them . The bearing looked terrible . In some places the metal was black with burnt oil and in others it was pounded smooth and silvery . Black and silver needles of wiped metal filled the oil grooves . Holman worked on the bottom half ; he could not hold off any longer . He cleaned out the oil grooves with a cape chisel and scraped the car-115 The Sand Pebblesbonized patches until the metal stopped coming off as gray dust and curled away in clean , silvery flakes . His hands enjoyed it and his eyes enjoyed seeing the bruised and dirty metal turn clean and frosty with scraper marks . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He began taking spots with the mandrel and scraping for a fit . Chiu-pa was scraping the top half and Holman saw that he was going much faster than Chiu-pa . He stopped to show Po-han how to scrape . Po-han was awkward . The scraper was a large three-cornered file with four inches of the small end ground smooth and grooved along each flat and the edges stoned sharp and smooth . The right hand had to learn a special rock and draw and the left hand had to learn how to pivot and tilt the edge for depth of cut . Holman could nip off a flake the size of a pinhead or curl off a long , broad shaving , without thinking how he did it , but he broke it down to fundamentals to show Po-han . The idle coolies squatted around grinning and watching and Holman had them all try their hands at it . They laughed and kidded in Chinese at each other 's fumbles . The one called Pai was pretty good with a scraper . They were all clever to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the why . They had a hollow steel mandrel the same size as the crankpin and they would coat it all over lightly with Prussian blue and roll it sliding around in a clean bearing half . When they lifted it out , blue would show on the contact points and they would scrape bearing metal off only under the blue highspots . After each scraping and test , the blue spots were bigger and there were more of them . Holman tried to explain about even distribution of load in the bearing so that no one area would have too big a share of the load and squeeze out the oil film and wipe . Po-han had to help the others in Chinese , because their English was not as good as his . Each blue spot was like a coolie who helped to hold the load of full engine power , Holman told them ; so the bigger the coolies and the more of them and the better spaced they were , the better they could hold the load . Pai and Dong and Chiu-pa did not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top half taking the gravity load of the pistonRichard McKenna 116and rod assembly , but they thought the coolies in the bottom half were loafers . They simply did not have the basic idea of energy flow . Po-han got it . He acted it out , fisting his arms around like a crank and saying , " Pushee pushee ! Pullee pullee ! " while the others looked at him in wonder . Yet Chiu-pa could spot and scrape and fit a bearing almost as skillfully as Holman . He did not need to know why he was doing what he did . It was just old custom . The stuff about little blue coolies was no more than a pleasant story to go with a piece of old custom . Well , they were all older men than Po-han , Holman thought . Maybe you had to be young . It was not old custom with Chiu-pa to round the edges of oil grooves , but when he saw how Holman did it he was willing to do the same . They put the refitted bearing back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lead wires squeezed inside to measure the oil clearance . When Holman wanted to take out shims to set the oil clearance at six thousandths , Chiu-pa objected . He was very sure that if it were not set at ten thousandths the bearing would burn out . He did not think of it as a figure or any kind of measurement , but only as matching scratch marks , probably made by old Chien , on the micrometer barrel and spindle . Well , if the engine was out of line , you would want more clearance to allow for that , Holman thought . There was something to be said for old custom , after all . He set it at ten . When the job was done and all of them had gone up except the watch coolie , it was nearly midnight . Holman felt tired and good . He felt satisfied at finally getting his hands on the machinery , and he was not going to let it go again . He made a pot of coffee and sat on the workbenchdrinking a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the log . He spread out a rag and sat beside Holman on the workbenchand had a cup of the coffee . They talked about Chien . " Them keys gone . Who 'd ever 've thought about that ? " " Everybody , after today , " Holman said . " Yeah , I guess . But you just never know , do you ? " 117 The Sand Pebbles " You can know if you want to , " Holman said . They heard noise topside . The landing force was back . Perna and Stawski came down and poured coffee and sat on the workbench . It was the first time they had ever come down off watch to drink engine room coffee . Wilsey told them about the keys . " It was them keys gone , huh , Jake ? " Stawski said . " You sure it was them keys gone done it , huh ? " He was eager about it . " Sure . Hell , yes , " Holman said . " What else ? " " It was them keys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go you , " Wilsey said . " We brought a missionary doctor back to look at Chien , " Perna said . " He 's up there now . " " They was all holed up in their compounds and the doctor did n't want to come out , " Stawski said . " The skipper really blistered his ass for him , way Bronson tells it . " " Wish I 'd heard it , " Wilsey said . " Prong missionaries . " " I was just thinking , working on that bearing , " Holman said " Any of you guys ever figure out just what it is you do , when you fit a bearing ? " " You spot and scrape and take leads , " Wilsey said . " Yeah , but why ? What do you mean by fit ? " " Well , fit . Everybody knows that . " Wilsey waggled his foot out in front of him . " Just fit . Like your foot in a shoe . " " In a bearing , it means equal distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Perna said . They did n't want to talk about bearings . Perna told about the rioting . The mob was out in the streets , all right , yelling and milling , but the Sand Pebbles had gone right on through to the warlord 's yamen . Lt. Collins had offered very politely to help the warlord stop the rioting and the warlord had declined politely and sent out his soldiers to do it alone . In a few hours they had the streets clear and quiet . The Sand Pebbles had gotten a good chow out of it , but Franks would not let them drink the warlord 's samshu . Afterward , they had checked all the missions . No palefaces had been hurt . Only a few native Christians had been killed . Richard McKenna 118 " One mission , they offered us all a glass of milk , " Stawski said . " What started them rioting anyway ? " Holman asked . " Some slopeheads claimed they saw a missionary woman boiling babies , " Perna said . " So they all went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful who they let see ' em , when they 're boiling babies , " Wilsey said. 8Chien still had life in the morning , like an ember in ashes . The missiondoctor wanted him to die on the San Pablo . When a Chinese died in a mission hospital , a story always started that the missionaries had murdered him so they could use his eyes to make camera lenses . If Chien died ashore , it might renew the rioting . After breakfast Bordelles took his landing force section on a boat trip to a rural mission about fifteen miles from Paoshan . The city looked normal , gates open in the gray stone walls and the line of water coolies chanting and slopping up the stone steps from the river . Not far above the city Farren turned the motor sampan into a broad creek . With his red beard under his white sun helmet and his strong , tanned bare legs , Farren looked like a pirate at the tiller . Bordelles sat beside him . Holman , Crosley , Tullio , Red Dog and Ellis sprawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na light a fire under China Light , huh , Mr. Bordelles ? " Red Dog said . " Going to try , " Bordelles said . " Anyway , it wo n't hurt to show the flag and a party of armed men to any bandits down off that mountain today . " 119Richard McKenna 120Holman sat up straight . China Light was Miss Eckert 's mission . He wondered if he might see her . He wished he had not spoken so harshly that last time they had talked . It was a clear , sunny morning and they had a lunch packed under the stern sheets . It began to seem like a picnic to Holman . The creek wound through green fields . It was stone-banked much of the way and overhung by drooping willow and mulberry trees . Children rode on water buffaloes that grazed along the bank . Other children tended duck flocks . They beat the ducks with bright rag scraps at the end of strings dangling like whips from long bamboo poles . The ducks quacked , but it did not hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed their heads and snorted , when they saw the boatload of armed ocean devils . Then the children peeped out again , very curious . But the grown people working in the fields or floating down to Paoshan in sampans filled with garden stuff only stared with blank faces . Away from the ship , Bordelles was quite democratic . He was tall and gawky , with a big nose and chin that would make a fine admiral 's mask someday . Holman began asking him questions about China Light . He learned that it was more than just a church and a school . It owned a lot of surrounding farmland . Hundreds of Chinese lived there , and about a dozen palefaces . It was supposed to be under the fat warlord in Paoshan , but it was also claimed by the bandit chief on the mountain , who was squaring around to fight the warlord . " A few more years and he 'll be the warlord , " Bordelles said . " Poor old General Pan will be going hungry up on the mountain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall off to the left . It came down steeply , without foothills , to the river flood plain . They were getting near enough to make out steep ravines , blueshadowywith timber . A lot of camphorwood and tung oil came from the mountain , Bordelles said . " Tell him about Old Man Craddock , " Farren said . " I seen him , " Holman said . " He was on the steamer I rode up from Shanghai . " " Did he speak to you at all ? " Bordelles asked 121 The Sand Pebbles " Once or twice , " Holman said . " Not very kindly . " Bordelles chuckled . " He would n't . Not old Craddock . " Craddock was a leader of a group which blamed all antiChristiantrouble in China on the treaties and gunboats , Bordelles explained . He had started a petition to have the San Pablo kept out of Tungting Lake . The people at China Light had notified the consul in Changsha that they were renouncing their personal treaty rights . They wanted no gunboat protection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course they could not do that . As American citizens , they were as much bound by the treaties as the Chinese were . The consul had told them so . " They know it and they like it , " Crosley growled . " They 're just making looksee pidgin for the slopeheads . " China Light was an independent mission . There were no higher echelons to bring pressure on Craddock , Bordelles went on . The China Light people would probably refuse to obey an evacuation order , if the consul had to send one out . So Lt. Collins had composed a waiver they would all have to sign individually . " They 're good . Read ' em one , Mr. Bordelles , " Red Dog urged . Bordelles read one . It stated that the undersigned chose to ignore consular advice to evacuate in full knowledge of the risk of harm to himself and embarrassment to the United States of America . " I swear before God that this is my own uninfluenced private and personal decision , and I hereby release the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the waivers ended . " They sign after they 've had a warning , " Bordelles said . " Might not be so easy , then . I have to make old Craddock sign a receipt for these and a promise ) . mail them to Changsha , if they ever refuse to evacuate . " " He 'll give you a bad time , Mr. Bordelles , " Tullio said . " I 'll give him one right back . " " They 'll run from real trouble , Craddock out in front , " Crosley said . " Do n't be too sure about old Craddock . " Bordelles told them about the file on Craddock in the consulate atRichard McKenna 122Changsha . His mission up north had been wiped out in the Boxer . His wife and several others had been killed . He got a big indemnity for them out of the Boxer Settlement , which also opened Hunan to missionaries . He married again and led the rush into Hunan , founding China Light in the same year the San Pablo had come to Tungting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots and with the indemnityfor that he bought enough local farmland to make the mission self-supporting . He owned it like a ranch . " Give him his due , he 's a tough old devil , " Bordelles said . They tied up at a stone jetty near a cluster of huts in a bamboo grove . Farren and Ellis stayed as boat guards . Bordelles led the four others in single file , arms slung , along a raised flagstoned path that was like a dike through fields blue with fat cabbages . The mission was about a mile away . It was a very long brick-walled compound with tiled roofs and treetops showing above the wall and the U.S. flag on a pole rising highest of all . Chinese huts scattered off from one end of it , into the fields . Bordelles took a branch of the path that led to the other end . It was hot walking under the high sun and dust stuck to their sweating bare legs and arms . Farmers in the fields watched them pass from under wide bamboo hats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ironbound double gates . The gates were closed . Bordelles knocked on the small side door . No one answered . Bordelles frowned and spat . " Not a word out of you men from here on , " he said . " You in particular , Shanahan . " " Arf arf , sir ! " the Red Dog said softly , and they all grinned . Bordelles drew his pistol and fired a shot into the ground . An old Chinese opened the side door , but he kept it on a chain and he could not understand anything . Finally a bearded white man came and flung the door open and stood there . " You are impatient , Mr. Bordelles , " he said . " I wish you had not done that . " He was Craddock . He was tall in a black suit , with a beak nose and fierce eyes deepset under shaggy eyebrows . His black beard was123 The Sand Pebblesstreaked with gray and he radiated power like an admiral . Bordelles was not abashed . " And I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've come on duty , Mr. Craddock . To check your safety and discuss changes in our evacuation plan . " " We are in God 's care here and we are all right . " Craddock had a deep , harsh voice . " All you accomplish , by coming here with your arms and your uniforms , is to imperil our standing with the Chinese . And we will never evacuate China Light , sir ! " " So you wrote the consul . That 's why I 'm here , sir . " Bordelles was being very formal . " Is there somewhere we can talk ? " " We are talking . " " I have papers you must read . I would prefer to talk privately , indoors . " Bordelles took a step toward the door . Craddock did not budge . " No doubt your arms are your warrant for forcible entry , " he said . Bordelles flushed scarlet . " Not at all , sir , " he said tautly . " Mymen are tired , hungry and thirsty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You are pleased to mock me , sir . Very well , come in . " Craddock stepped aside from the door . " I must ask you to leave your arms and cigarettes in the gate house . " They went in . " Put your cigarettes on that shelf , men , " Bordelles said . " The arms too , if you please , sir , " Craddock said behind them . " I am not free to please , sir . We are ashore on duty under arms , " Bordelles said . " Go ahead through , men . " It was abruptly cool and clean and green inside the wall . Three big white clapboard houses with green shutters lined each side of a flagstoned street . They were set back among trees and rose arbors and flower beds on neat lawns marked off by white picket fences . All the houses had downstairs and upstairs verandas with white railings and rocking chairs . Nobody was in sight except some coolies sprinklingwater on flower beds and borders . It was a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKenna 124 " This way , please . " Craddock passed them with quick , chopping strides , stiff and angry , and they followed him up the path to the first house on the right . A house servant in a gray gown came out and Craddock gave him sharp orders in Chinese . He led the sailors around by the side veranda to a back porch and pointed to some benches . He was being very snotty , in a Chinese way . They sat down , leaning on their rifles upright between their knees , and looked at each other disgustedly . " I guess we ai n't going to get any chow , " Crosley said . " Do n't look like it , " Holman agreed . Crosley was a signalman , a squat , ugly little man with a big head , pop eyes and a wide mouth like a frog . He had a hoarse , croaking voice to match his face . " That cheap , biblebacked old devil ! " he said . " Bordelles broke a few off in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there right now . " From time to time they could hear voices rise angrily somewhere inside the house . A servant came at last , with a basket of damp towels and bowls of tea . The sailors swabbed their faces and arms and legs with the towels , for momentary freshening . The towels were tepid instead of hot . They were getting second-chop treatment . Crosley scowled at his bowl of tea . " Do n't drink this slop , guys , " he warned . " They prob'ly pissed in it . " " Watch it ! " Tullio whispered sharply . Shirley Eckert was seated at her desk in the faculty office when she heard the shot . She went to the open window and saw Mr. Craddock stride angrily across to the gatehouse . She knew the gunboat was in Paoshan and the danger was supposed to he past . She was still nervous . Then armed sailors in white sun helmets and shorts came through the gatehouse . They swung along jauntily . Mr. Craddock took their officer into his house and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window . " I hope you 're not alarmed , Miss Eckert. " 125 The Sand PebblesShe turned . Mr. Gillespie had come in . His brown hair was rumpled and his tanned , pleasant face looked concerned . " I thought that shot might have alarmed you , " he said . " It 's only a bit of navy arrogance . Mr. Craddock will soon get rid of them . " " He 'll be rude to them , you mean ? " " Well . . . very formal . " Gillespie smiled . " Their coming here is deliberate provocation , you understand . They know they 're not wanted here . " Shirley was not sure she did not want them . Gillespie noted her hesitation . " Our only chance to carry on our work in China lies in breaking the association in Chinese minds between gunboats and missions , at least China Light , " he said . " That officer could just as well have come alone , in civilian clothes , if he had to come at all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " Shirley said . They had all been telling her about it . It was true enough . But something was not right . " All right , Mr. Craddock will be rude , " Gillespie said . " The Chinese will see and talk about his rudeness . Thus he makes this visit weaken the association rather than strengthen it , as they mean it to . " She nodded . Gillespie sat on a desk corner , one leg dangling . " The men . The sailors , " she said . " They ca n't help it . They have to obey orders . " " They 're hard men who have chosen a hard life . " " They 'll think we despise them . " " We must persuade the Chinese that we do . " He leaned forward . " They come flaunting rifles , " he said . " Rifles are for killing people , killing Chinese , in this case . How could we honestly welcome them , even without Chinese watching us ? " Mr. Gillespie was an evangelist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been quietly attentive and helpful to Shirley in getting settled at China Light . She did not want to disagree with him . " I think I will just go down and see if they want water , " she said . " I 'm sure Mrs. Craddock will have tea and towels sent out to them . " Richard McKenna 126If she dares , Shirley thought . Mr. Craddock utterly dominated his fragile wife . " Then just to say hello , " she said . " One friendly word . " He stood up , frowning slightly . " 1 ' 11 go with you . " " No . Please , " she said . " Not against your convictions , Mr. Gillespie . I 'm new and ignorant . It wo n't spoil anything , if I go . " He protested . She went out alone , taking stock of herself . She had on a tan dress with long sleeves and of course no makeup . She was having to let her hair grow out and she had scarcely enough yet for the skimpy knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to walk slowly so that perspiration would not soak through her dress . She was not going to charm anyone . But she could speak a friendly word . As she went down the side veranda of the Craddock house , she heard the old man 's angry voice inside . On the rear veranda one of the sailors whispered , " Watch it ! " fiercely , as if danger threatened . The four men jumped to their feet facing her , each with his rifle . It was awkward . She scanned their faces and words would not come . Then , with a small thrill , she recognized the big , square man . " Mr. Holman ! " she said . " I 'm so glad to see you again ! " " Miss Eckert . Hello there . " She had not meant her greeting to be so warm . Holman named off the other men for her like objects . They grinned , very ill at ease . It was hard to make talk . The nice-looking Italian boy was from Brooklyn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from New Jersey . She felt they wished she would go away and leave them to their man talk . She started to excuse herself . " If you 'd care to walk through the grounds , I 'll be glad to show you around , " she said , instead . Dutifully polite , they mumbled thanks and began to sling their rifles . " Oh , you 'd have to leave your rifles here , " she told them . " Then we ca n't go , " the froggy one said . " I 'll go , " Holman said . He leaned his rifle on a bench . " Take charge , Crosley , " he told the froggy man. 127 The Sand Pebbles " You ca n't ! You 're on duty ! " Crosley objected . " If any enemy attacks , you guys just open fire , " Holman said . " I 'll be back here before you see the whites of their eyes . " " It ai n't funny , Holman ! " Crosley said angrily . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arf ! Arf ! " one of the men said softly behind them . Holman grinned . " We call that one Red Dog on the ship , " he said . " I hope you wo n't get in trouble , leaving your rifle . " " They all make-believe with guns , " he said dryly . " Soon as they pick one up they 're John Paul Jones defending the Alamo , or some-thing . " " And you do n't make-believe ? " " Not with guns . I 'm an engineer . " He glanced around . " These houses and lawns and flowers sure look nice . " " They 're for the American staff . Most of them are away now , at Kuling for the summer . " They came into the grassy quadrangle with the flagpole in its center . Holman looked husky and sunburned and much more sure of himself than he had seemed on the steamer from Shanghai . " That 's the middle school , where I will teach , " she told him , pointing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student dormitory . And down at the other end is the hospital . " They were handsome two-story brick buildings with arcaded verandas and Chinese roofs , quiet because of summer vacation . Only the hospital had its verandas crowded and people coming and going . She told him about the Chinese doctor and nurses and all the work they did . " They have to send serious cases , like major surgery , to Paoshan , " she said . " But they do a lot of good . " " I 'll bet they do , " he agreed . " Say , you know , this is a pretty place . " He was sniffing the air and looking at the flowering shrubs and borders . " It 's like a park , " he said . She led him on through into the Chinese section of low houses in walled courts , all whitewash and gray-tiled roofs . The streets thereRichard McKenna 128were busy with cart and coolie traffic and children scrambling . She nodded and said hello to several Chinese wearing gowns . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explained . " I do n't know them all apart yet . They live in these houses . " " This is a big place . " He was looking all around . Just inside the shop and storehouse section she halted. " 1 do n't know what all is in here , " she said . " It goes on outside the gate . Some of the people are staff and some rent their shops and stores from the mission and work on their own . " " Like a little town , ai n't it ? " The high chatter of voices and the tool noises of men at work came through the sour-smoky smell . He sniffed . " It even smells like a Chinese town , " he said . " It 's not dirty , " she said defensively . " It 's the food and cooking oil they use , and incense . Lacquer and camphorwood in the work-shops . " " Hell , I like it ! " he said . " I 'm sorry if you thought  --  I mean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . " " Those long buildings , godowns , " she said . " The mission takes a share of the crops for land rent . Mr. Craddock keeps a reserve in those godowns , for bad years . No one ever starves around China Light . " " Like in the Bible . The skinny cows , " he said . " You know , this is all right . I guess I always thought missions only saved souls . " " They do , but that 's not in my department , " she said . " Mr. Craddockhas all sorts of plans for China Light . He has some machinery set up to make sugar out of beets , but nobody can make it work right . He has an electric light plant , still in the crates , someone told me . " " Whereabouts ? " " Somewhere in there . " She waved vaguely . " It 's too hot here . Let 's go on . " She led him to what had already become her favorite retreat , a stone bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Climbing roses covered the rough stone wall and tinged the air with delicate scent and color . Bees and one little bird were busy129 The Sand Pebblesthere . He sat beside her and fanned them both with his sun helmet . It had the name U.S.S. San Pablo in gold on a black ribbon sewed across the front brim . She looked at his face , strong , blunt and honest . He looked at her and she became abruptly conscious of her appearance . " I 'm letting my hair grow out , " she apologized . " It 's at its most wretched stage now . " She tried to tuck away stray wisps . " They do n't want me to wear most of the dresses I brought . " " You 're so young and pretty , nothing could spoil how good you look . " He said it honestly . She was not pretty , but if he thought she was , that made her so for him . She warmed to him . " Thank you , Mr. Holman . " Delicately , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has strong opinions , " she said . " I 'm afraid he 's right . Only I wish it did n't have to make such a difference between people . That 's why . . . what I . . . " " I know , " he said . " The guys felt it . They wo n't blame you . " " Not just me . . . " She could n't discuss it . She told him how she was studying Chinese six hours a day with Mr. Lin . She would have one class , of senior students who spoke fair English , when school started . By the next year she would know enough Chinese to take a full teaching load . " How long they got you signed up for ? " he asked . " Seven years . " " We ship for four at a time , " he said . " I been in China a little over seven years . " " Without going home ? " " My ship 's home . That 's how it is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way with me at China Light , " she said . " It is n't now . I wonder how long it takes ? " " Depends on the person , I guess . For me it was quick . " They talked about the riots in Paoshan . He was not pressing any claim . Still , she could not deny that the riots had sprung up in the gunboat 's absence and stopped with its arrival . She confessed to herRichard McKenna 130own fear during those two days , and her relief when the gunboat came . He smiled . " I 'm glad we came . " One of the Craddock house servants found them and chattered in Chinese . They stood up . " Your officer is ready to go , " she told him . " I hope he wo n't be angry with you . " " I do n't think so . " Constraint grew between them . She wondered if he was rememberinghow he had taken leave of her that other time . Suddenly he had both her hands . She realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good-bye , Miss Eckert , " he said . " I do n't feel any danger here . But if there ever is , we 'll be back . " He pressed her hands and dropped them . She watched him walk away behind the servant , husky and red , erect and square-shouldered . She did not feel any danger , either . She sat down again . Sometimes you met people and something flashed across , she thought . It was over in a flash , and you only knew about it afterward . This was the second time with Holman . The first time was on the steamer from Shanghai to Hankow . Riots were going on in Shanghai , with people killed . The passengers on the steamer were nervous and angry and they quarreled terribly . Holman took no part in it . The others talked of past wars and massacres and they were making her very fearful of China . It had been warm and sunny also , that other day . They were just passing a wooded bluff with gray walls and towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere the American destroyercame like a long gray spear flying . Brown smoke rolled from its four rakish stacks , sailors in white stood by the deck guns , and a string of colored signal flags danced gaily above the bridge . It was beautiful and deadly and it brought a catch to her throat . The steamer , rocking in its wake , was instantly all alarm . Men shouted and ran and clanged shut the steel doors penning the Chinese on the lower decks . Mr.131 The Sand PebblesCraddock hustled her to her cabin for safety . There would be shooting , he said . Alone there and fearful , she peeped from her window as the steamer rounded the wooded point . Gray walls slanted across a green hill and dark tiled roofs curved above them . Brown junks lay all along shore . The anchored destroyer swam into view , guns trained ashore . Two power boats filled with armed sailors drew V 's in the brown water , heading in past some wooden ship hulls with house roofs above their decks . Buildings showed through trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . She heard a distant noise of shouting . Distressed and fearful , vaguely not wanting to be alone , she had slipped out on deck . She saw Holman there , sturdy with his rifle . The sight brought the same catch to her throat that the destroyer had . Then he had pointed his finger through the bars and her focus had widened out to include the three Chinese children . " Bang bang , you 're dead , " the sailor said gravely . The children hesitated and then smiled . One pointed and said , " Cah ! Cah ! Cah ! " in an excited voice . Holman grinned at them . The little play changed everything . Her sense of danger vanished . It all seemed a game in which no one really hated and feared anyone else . That was in the smile they exchanged when he turned , startled and guilty , to meet her understanding smile . A short while afterward she was in the saloon with the refugee women . They came aboard off the hulks with amahs and crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strained , angry faces and the cords stood out in their necks . " Of course they run away when the sailors come , the cowards ! " one woman said . " Tie them to the cannon 's mouth , I say ! " " Whip them ! Make their bones drop out ! " another shrilled . Shirley could not hope to tell them what she knew . Nor could she tell the men , at an ensuing dinner-table argument . Mr. Craddock , not too gently , pointed out that the missionaries in Chinkiang had not been molested . They lived out among the natives and they had stayed quietly at home in prayer . The people from the foreign concession , Richard McKenna 132businessmen and the collectors of customs , salt tax and postal revenues , had fled to the hulks and sent for the destroyer . Their homes were looted and some houses were burned . Mr. Outscout , the chronicallyangry Englishman , had countered with an attack on Christian education in China . " Your schools . Put notions into Chinese heads . Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said accusingly . " How d'ye know what 's already in the heads , eh ? You 're all fools playing chemist . " He fountained with his hands . " Heads pop ! Burn ! Fizz over ! " It was a great embarrassment , Shirley knew , that mission-educated students were the most virulently anti-Christian . They were so despite considerable missionary support for Chinese independence . The business faction , which clung to the unequal treaties , enjoyed taunting the missionaries about it . " Christian education ! " Mr. Outscout tossed his gray hair scornfully . " Told Graves a few days past in Shanghai . Parade your very campuses , I told him , and for every placard denouncing the treaties there 's another maligning your Christ . Where 's your profit , eh ? Eh ? Graves could n't answer ! " " Our Christ , Mr. Outscout ! Will you deny Him , sir ? " The other men calmed the two . Holman , as usual , took no part . She no longer thought it was apathy . He simply did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to Mr. Craddock , who expected Shirley to side with him . On the trip to Hankow she had learned how deep and angry was the gulf between the two factions of foreigners in China . Many missionaries believed that the unequal treaties impairing Chinese sovereignty should be canceled . The most visible symbols of the treaties were the gunboats . Gunboats infuriated Mr. Craddock . They made it seem to him that he was preaching Christianity figurativelyat gunpoint . He had not liked her talking to Holman . " The saintliest spirit , if unguarded , may take a coloring from a troubled spirit which comes too near , " he had warned her once , in attempted delicacy . He did not speak to Holman himself. 133 The Sand PebblesSince her arrival at China Light , she had wondered more than once whether Mr. Craddock 's spirit was not troubled . He loved fiercely . He trusted God rather than gunboats with emotional speech and gestures which made God seem very like an invisible gunboat in the sky . Shirley did not want to take a coloring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get excited . " The Chinese are the most civilized people on earth , " he had told her . " Too many of us approach them as if they were tribal Africans . I hope you will not . " He also wanted to get rid of the treaties and gunboats . " The Chinese have a fundamental sense of decency and justice , " he said . " The gunboats only outrage it . We 'd be safer without them . " Shirley found that reasonable . She liked Gillespie . She thought Holman might have been a man much like Gillespie , if chance had not cast him as a sailor . Each man in his own way gave her comfort . She stood up , abruptly lighthearted . She began picking roses for her desk in the faculty office , where she must go now for her Chinese lesson with Mr. Lin . He was an elderly , dignified man and very patient with her . No one could help but trust and respect China in the presence of Mr. Lin . He gave comfort , too. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Craddock had left him in a bad temper . Once back in the boat , however , he softened . Red Dog urged him to tell about his fight with Craddock . Bordelles made a good story of it . Craddock , being independent , was hard to deal with . By the same token , he could not exert anything like the political influence back in the States that the mission board people could . All the Americans who put pennies in the plate to save the heathen could also put votes in the box to sink a Congressman . It was dangerous for a naval officer to cross a mission board . It was not very dangerous to insult Craddock . " You think they 'll really run the gunboats out of China , sir ? " Tullio asked . " Not a chance . They do n't want to , " Bordelles said . " They only want to be on record with the Chinese pretending that they do . " " What you think we 're building that new flotilla for , Tullio ? " Farren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lynch was waiting for Holman on the quarterdeck . " Jake , come below , " he said . " We got troubles , boy . " Holman followed him . " What happened ? " 134135 The Sand Pebbles " The engine 's haunted . " " Haunted ! " " The coolies think it is . Chien 's dead and his ghost is in the L.P. crankpit . The coolies are scared to come down here . " The engineers were all in dungarees , sitting on the workbench with a fresh pot of coffee . Lynch and Holman poured themselves cups and Lynch explained what Lop Eye Shing had told him about Chinese ghosts . It was very complicated . Dead Chinese left three ghosts . One of Chien 's was in the sickbay and one had gone ashore with his body , but the most dangerous of the three was the one in the crankpit . " Lop Eye says a Chinee ghost after while splits into little ghosts , and they split again , and after a month or two they ai n't no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't wait that long . We ca n't get underway without the coolies , " Holman said . " Lop Eye 's ashore now lining up some holy man to come aboard tomorrow and run the ghost off the ship , " Lynch said . " We 'll have to stand the auxiliary watches tonight , though . " Haythorn , the coxswain , came in on the gratings . " Hey , you bilge rats , " he called down . " How about some water in the washroom ? " Stawski slid off the workbench . " God damn it , I been filling that gravity tank every half hour , " he said . " What you deck apes doing with all that water ? " He went over and opened the steam inlet and started the fresh water pump clacking . Holman walked over beside him . " Keeping the water end lined up , eh , Ski ? " " Hell yes , every half hour , why not ? " " The water chest valves leak . Your water 's draining back through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discharge valve and it wo n't be every half hour . " Perna bounced out of the fireroom . Coal dust and sweat smudged his face and he was angry . He choked in the feed check . " You stupid Polack , watch how you take on feed ! " he told Stawski . " You 're killing my steam ! " " Come out here and tend your own God damned water , " StawskiRichard McKenna 136said . " You 're a watertender , ai n't you ? " " Damn right I am , and that means I 'm a rated man and not a coolie , " Perna said . " You come out and pass coal for me . " " Like hell ! I ai n't no coolie either . " Stawski turned to Lynch . " Chief , why do n't you fire them stupid coolies , if they wo n't work ? " " And then where 'd you be ? " Lynch said . " You figure two men on watch , do you ? " Holman asked Lynch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't reckon as I want to , myself , " Burgoyne said . " I wo n't stay down here alone at night , " Perna said . " Neither will Ski . We already talked about it . " " You mean both you guys believe in ghosts ? " " Not in American ghosts , " Perna said . " You ca n't tell about slopeheads . They 're sneaky bastards . " " If they think they got three ghosts , they might really have one , " Wilsey said . " Where there 's smoke there 's fire , Jake . " Burgoyne knuckled his mustache . " When I was a kid we lived in a house once where things come knocking on the door at night , " he said . " It bothered the womenfolk right much . We moved out of that house . " " Well hell , " Holman said . " We lack one man for a two-man watch hst . How about Harris ? " " He swears he wo n't come down here except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't look at me like that , either . Take Waxer . " " He know anything ? " " No . But he 'll be company . " " I 'll take the midwatch by myself , " Holman said . " If you 'll leave me a clean fire and a coal pile , Frenchy . " " I 'll sure do that , " Burgoyne said . After supper Holman talked with Farren and Bronson about taking engineers off the topside watch list . They sat at Bronson 's mess table with their watch lists . " Why ca n't you just let things slide down there , till the coolies come back ? " Bronson asked 137 The Sand Pebbles " There 'd be no water and the lights 'd go out , " Holman said . " You think you get them lights as natural as sunshine ? " He did not like Bronson . Petty officers who worked on the bridge , close to the officers , often acted as if some of the glory rubbed off on them . Bronson was very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Farren 's only losing two , " Bronson said . " That 's all I 'll give you . I 'll give you Perna and Stawski . " " I 'll take them and Wilsey too , " Holman said . " You ai n't giving me nothing , Bronson . I 'm taking my own men down where they belong . " " And I 'll take ' em back , " Bronson said . " You do n't have the right attitude , Holman . I 've heard the officers worry about you . Why do n't you get wise ? " " I 'm wise to you . Prong you . " " Take it easy , Jake , " Farren said . " And I 'm wise to you , " Bronson said . His face was red . " That coffee pot you started down there . The whole ship knows you rigged things to get Chien killed . " " Say that again ! " Holman stood up , leaning with his hands on the table . " God damn you , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bronson said defiantly . " You got some pet coolie down there you want to put in Chien 's place . " " Who told you that ? " " It 's just scuttlebutt . " " Scuttlebutt travels on words . " Holman 's voice was shaking . " You tell me one man you heard say that , or I 'll beat your fat face in ! " The other men were gathering around . Bronson had turned pale and it was very quiet in the compartment . " Hell , you know how scuttlebutt is , Jake , " Farren said . " It 's just talk , all a joke , what the hell ? " " Not when it calls me a murderer , it ai n't no joke ! " Holman looked at them all . " Any of you guys tell Bronson that ? " They all shook their heads . " Somebody has to say a thing for the first time . I think you just done that , " Holman told Bronson . " Now you come with me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take it back ! " Richard McKenna 138 " I was hasty , " Bronson said . " I guess I take it back . " " You mean you ai n't sure ? " Holman leaned nearer Bronson . " I 'm sure . I take it back . " " Well , see that you stay sure and you keep it back ! " Holman stood erect . He was trembling . " If I hear that story again from anybody , I 'll come beat your lying teeth down your throat ! " He walked back on the fantail , to be alone . Strangely , Stawski came back to reassure him . Holman brushed Stawski off . He did n't want to have to talk to anybody for a while . Wilsey and Burgoyne turned the watch over to Holman at midnight . It was in excellent shape . The steam was up and the fire cleaned and dampered and he would not have to tend the fire for at least an hour . He paced the floorplates restlessly , drifting around and looking at everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , Chien was dead . Dead . The engine room was already looking untidy . Water beaded the oily floorplates around the riremain pump and dirty rags hung here and there . The drip pan under the condensate pump was half full of water and smeared with swabbing oil . Holman began tidyingand wiping , to keep his mind busy . For some reason he kept remembering old Ed Gard . He had not once thought about old Eddie in many years . When he was eight he had a red coaster wagon to fetch the dirty clothes home and to deliver the clean laundry , all over town . Sometimesthe nice ladies gave him old clothes for him and his little brothers . They always showed him how strong and good the clothes still were and he was trained to say thank you to the nice ladies . It was hard to be friends with the other kids at school and around , when they laughed at him for wearing their old clothes , and the only friend he had was old Eddie . Eddie had a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feedyard on the edge of town , across the road from Jorry Holman 's house . Eddie had been in the Civil War and fought Indians afterward and he had a Pension . It was his plain duty to marry some good , Christian woman and let her take care of him , so that she could have a Widow 's Pension when be died . Jorry 's mother139 The Sand Pebbleswas one of the good women . But Eddie loved only horses and he would not even speak to any woman . He lived in the grain room and kept his clothes in a brown canvas warbag . He always wore khaki shirts and blue Levis . Sometimes , when he was working on harness with a bottle beside him , he would sing to himself , and he did not mind Jorry Holman watching and listening . He could not sing very well . One of his songs was : Oh , I 'm goin ' away to the Filla Pie NeensTo fight for my country and to live on beans . Sometimes it was the Filla Pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jorry Holman hoped he might go too . Jorry liked to get old Eddie talking about fighting Indians . He had fought them all over and he had been in a big Indian fight right where Wellco was now , only then it was only sagebrush and a few willows and cottonwoods along the creek . He had taken an arrow through his cheek and the scar still showed . Eddie dice not remember how the arrow tasted , but he said it hurt like billy hell when the whisky they gave him ran out through the hole . " What did you do with the arrowhead ? " Jorry asked . He wanted to see it , and to hold it in his hand . " I spit it out , " Eddie said . Eddie divided Indians into friendlies and hostiles , but he said they were all hostiles under their plagued red skins . Everybody knew the only good Indian was a dead one , but now they were living off the government up in Duck Valley and breeding like flies , and someday they would try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about old Eddie when he pulled his red wagon around Wellco with the laundry . He never knew but what right where he was standing maybe old Eddie killed an Indian on that spot before there were any houses in Wellco . One day , out in the sagebrush close behind his house , Jorry found a pure white arrowhead . He kept it and believed it was the very one which had gone through old Eddie 's cheek . After all , Eddie had had to spit it out somewhere nearby . The summer Jorry was ten years old Eddie took sick . The **27;3820;TOOLONG here from offices in the Russ Building in San Francisco . " " There 's your point , " Mr. McClellan repeated . " Here 's my point , " Walter Knight said . " We 're ex-pendable . " Everett smiled at Lily . The sun was setting behind his chair and his blond hair , cut close , looked white in the sunset blaze . Lily extended one bare foot and contemplatedit , not smiling back . Neither she nor her mother ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tactless to speak of the Legislature . Although Everett called her at six-thirty the next morning he did not wake her , because the heat had stayed all night and she had gotten up at five-thirty to lie on the terrace in her nightgown . By six o'clock the sun had been high enough to make the heat shimmer in the air again . Looking to the east and squinting to block out the sun , she could make out the Sierra Nevada swimming clear on the horizon . She wanted to go somewhere but did not know where . There was a glass of beer on the table , left from the night before , and she flicked a small colorless spider from the rim with her fingernail and let the warm flat beer trickle down her throat . That there was really nowhere to go ( she did not like the mountains and had only a week before come home from the coast ) made her no less restless , lying almost motionless in the still morning heat and chewing absently on the sash to her nightgown . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her grades had arrived from Berkeley yesterday , neatly and irrevocably recorded on the self-addressed postcards she had left in her bluebooks . One B-minus , in English 1B ;  |p51a  C in History 17A , a C in Psychology 1B , a C-minus in Geology 1 ( commonly known as a football players ' course in which it was impossible to get below a B ) , and a D in French 2 . Because the single B was in a three-unit course and the D in a four-unit course , she supposed that she was down grade points and therefore on probation . Had the postcards arrived at school , she would have been embarrassed . Here , it did not seem to matter . As her mother had observed , she had read some interesting books and gone to some nice parties ; once she was home , that was about the sum of Berkeley . She did not want to go back anyway . She could read books at home ; she could have a better time at parties at home . It was not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the parties which were the parties to go to ; she had . On a campus where healthy color and easy smiles were commonplace , her fragile pallor , her uncertainty , had attracted a good deal of attention and speculation . Only when the boys who asked her out discovered how real the uncertainty was did they begin , bewildered and bored , to lose interest . As one of them told Lily 's roommate ( who , reprovingly , told Lily ) , taking out Lily Knight was like dating a deaf-mute . " You have to kid around with them , be more fun , " the roommate advised . " Be yourself . " Although these admonitions seemed to Lily in some sense contradictory , she tried , the next weekend , to be more like the girls who were considered fun . Out with a Sigma Chi who had just been accepted at Princeton Theological Seminary , she had attempted some banter about Reinhold Niebuhr ; when that failed , she admired the way he played the ukelele . After several drinks , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although she neither understood them nor thought he should be telling them to her , she laughed appreciatively . When he asked if she would like to drive up in the Berkeley hills , shep52smiled with delight and said it sounded like fun ; later , she reflected that it had not been entirely his fault that he had misinterpreted her behavior that evening , which had ended in front of an all-night drugstore on Shattuck Avenuewhere , the prospective theologian told Lily , he could get some rubbers . ( " Rubbers ? " she had said , and he had looked at her . " Safes . Contraceptives . " She had begun shakingher head then , unable to think what to say , and he , sobered , had driven her in silence up the hill to the Pi Phi house . ) After that , she had refused all invitations for three weeks . During the spring semester she had gone out briefly with a graduate student who read for her psychology class , a Jewish boy from New York City named Leonard Sachs . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people Lily knew . They had taken long walks in the hills above the stadium , back through StrawberryCanyon ; had eaten dinner by candlelight in the small apartment he shared with a friend who did not like Lily and made a point of going to the library whenever she was around ; and had sat on Thursday nights in the empty box at the San Francisco Symphony for which the Pi Phis paid every year . He gave her articles clipped from The New Republic outlining the intrinsic immorality of an itinerant labor force , hunted up for her an old pamphletdemanding repeal of the California Criminal SyndicalismLaw , took her to San Francisco on the F train to hear a tribute to Harry Bridges , and urged her , after he had observed her knitting a sweater for her father , to utilizewhat slender talents she had by teaching handicrafts in a settlement house . Unable to locate " settlement houses " in the Berkeley Yellow Pages , she finally abandoned that project . He referred to the ranch as " your father 's farm , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he held defective mechanisms and the craven de/light he secretly took in luxury merchandise ; she asked him if he would not miss being home at Easter , and regardedhim in constant and only occasionally unwilling wonder . What both aggravated and enthralled him was her total freedom from his personal and social furies , and those Eumenides at his back were what attracted and repelledLily . " You 're my haunted lover , " she would laugh , although he was , literally , neither ; a fact which , in his roommate 's eyes , tended to confirm Lily 's social uselessness . She had even invited him up the river for a day during spring week . Once home , she regretted having asked him . But he was delighted by the prospect of observing her in her native decay , and so she drove to Sacramento to meet him one morning . As soon as she saw him standing on the lawn in front of the Southern Pacific station , radiating the same intense concern which had first charmed her in Berkeley , she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien to the Valley as she might have been to the Bronx , and the alienation went deeper than his black turtleneckedsweater , went beyond the copy of In Dubious Battlewith which he had been briefing himself on the train . By the time she drove him to the station that evening ( he had tried throughout dinner to correct the errors in Walter Knight 's impression of Upton Sinclair and EPIC ) , she was too exhausted even to speak . " You 'll be glad to get away from all this , " he said tentatively , taking a last drag on a cigarette and throwing it out the window . " Get away from all what ? " she said , watching the sparks in the rearview mirror . " I meant you 'll feel free in New York . You 'll develop . " Uncomfortably aware that she had at some point agreed to go to New York with him ( although she had never had the slightest intention of doing so ) , she increasedher pressure on the accelerator . " I 'm not likely to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once safe enough top54say what she meant , her hands on the wheel of her father 's car , driving the roads for which her father paid . " Any more than you 're likely to get away from wherever it is you come from . And we do n't throw cigarettes out the window here . It starts fires . " She had meant to go to bed with him but because she had still to discover , at seventeen , the possibilities in someone she did not like , she had not . Abruptly , Lily stood up and lifted the damp hair off her neck . With aimless violence , she threw the beer glass down the slope , then ran after it to where the lawn faded into dirt and dry yellow grass . Kicking a faucet open with her foot , she let the clear water ( well water , not the river water they used for irrigation ) splash over her arms and face . It was a waste of water early in a dry summer , and its extravagance relieved her . That helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break from the tree , and by the time she reached the house in her wet nightgown the telephone was ringing . " Sorry if I woke you , " Everett McClellan said . " I 'm about to take a truck into town for some extra help . " " You did n't wake me . " This was more like it . Hoping , although it could not matter , that her mother had not picked up the extension in her bedroom , she tried to smooth her hair with her free hand . " I mean I thought  --  " He spoke with some difficulty . " I thought you might like to ride in . " " Right now ? " " You 're probably busy . " " Not really . " She wondered what he thought she did between six-thirty and seven-thirty in the morning . " I 'll get dressed . " As she shook out her wet hair with a towel she hummedp55softly , and looked in the mirror for the first time in months without regretting the waste of her perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Marth , " Everett said when she climbed into the truck . " I 'm older . A year . " She glanced down at her thin arms , brown against the white of her dress . Martha McClellan was not yet seventeen , a freshman come fall at the Universityof California at Davis . When Lily 's mother , on the behalf of the Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Club , had urged Martha to enroll at Berkeley and participate in rushing , Martha had told her that it was necessary that she go to Davis , which was mainly an agricultural station , because her father wanted her to marry a rich rancher . And as a matter of fact so did she . Martha McClellan , Edith Knight had observed , was " a case . " " I know how old you are , " Everett said without looking at her . Lily pressed her forehead against the window , closed against the heat . Now in June the hops were starting up the strings , miles of them , ready to bear the thick green weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good year for the hops ; because her father did not grow them she did not know why . She supposed that it had to do with when the rain had come . Everything else did . " The hops are pretty , " she said . " You think so ? " " Yes , I do , " she said , rather at a loss . When it came to conversation , Everett McClellan was not one to give much away . " I think they 're very pretty and I 'm glad I 'm home . " They did not exchange another word until they reached the Labor Center in the West End , where Everett , getting out of the truck , ordered her to lock both doors from the inside and wait until he came back . As soon as he had en/tered the office , one of the Mexicans standing on the sidewalkoutside made a face at Lily . She smiled , embarrassed , and then pretended to be reading a book in her lap . After Everett had recruited thirteen men , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once at her , when he had trouble starting the truck , and then neither looked at her nor spoke . Her eyes closed , she listened to the men in the back of the truck , singing Bing Crosby songs and passing around a bottle of dago red , and wondered why Everett had called her at all . Mr. McClellan met them at the ranch , flagging wildly when he caught sight of the truck , an unnecessary exertion since he was standing where the trucks were habitually parked . Lily could not remember ever having seen him calm : even years before , when he had brought Everett and Martha and Sarah to call , he had given the appearance of a man beset by his own energy , scrawny with tension . He would leap to his feet when Edith Knight entered the room , accidentally knock over a chair , institute a prolongedsearch for a handkerchief , bound across the room to collar one of the children . He had always spoken to them as if they were puppies . Down , Martha . Sit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he muttered now , leaning over Everett 's shoulder as Everett entered the names on the payroll ledger . " Nobody left come seven o'clock but high-school boys and drunken wetbacks . Here 's one fact you wo n't learn in college , Miss Lily Knight : there 's nobody in God 's green world has less native intelligencethan a goddamn wetback . " Everett had once explained that his father referred to all Mexicans and to most South Americans  --  including the President of Brazil , who had once been entertained on the river  --  as goddamn wetbacks , and to all Orientals as goddamn Filipinos . There was no use telling him that somebody was Chinese , or Malayan , or Madame Chiang Kai-shek ; they were god/damn Filipinos to him . Easterners fell into two camps : goddamn pansies and goddamn Jews . On the whole , both categories had to do with attitudes , not facts , and occasionallythey overlapped . His daughter Sarah had for example married a goddamn pansy and gone East to live , where she picked up those goddamn Jew ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Levis and of her incongruously white dress . There was one thing about the McClellans not true of her father : they would n't run their ranches out of an office in the Russ Building even if they could afford to . Everett looked up . " We could ride along the river when I 'm finished . " " I do n't ride very well . " " Hah , " Mr. McClellan said . " I 'll say you do n't . She used to ride like she was sitting on a barbed-wire fence . I remember that much about Miss Lily Knight . Do n't be a fool , Everett . Take her swimming . " " I do n't have my swimming suit . " Lily remembered that Martha not only jumped horses at the State Fair every year but had twice beaten the Del Paso Country Club junior swimming champion in unofficial competition . " That child sees a bird , she tries to race it , " Edith Knight had once observed of Martha . An admirer of competitivenessin all forms , Edith Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha McClellan 's book " ; that Martha was a notoriously poor loser did not bother her , since she did not believe that losing was the point . " There 's one thing Martha has plenty of , that 's tank suits , " Mr. McClellan declared . " We can suit you fine . " Pleased with this play on words , he repeated it , and then bounded up to the house , screaming ahead for China Mary to get Martha on the stick and rustle up some tank suits . The McClellan house had the peculiarly sentimentalp58look of a house kept by men . There were pictures of Sarah and of Mildred McClellan , who had died at Martha 's birth ; above the piano ( " How 's that for a piano ? " Mr. McClellan liked to demand affectionately . " Came ' round the Horn in ' forty-eight " ) , the California Republic Bear Flag hung at what appeared to be half-mast . One wall was covered with framed certificates from the Native Sons of the Golden West and river maps showing channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts toward brightening up ran to crocheted antimacassars on the chairs and orange zinnias crushed haphazardly into Limoges cream-soup bowls . In one corner of the living room , on a table covered with a mantilla , was an assortment of gold nuggets and ivory fans . Although the table had always been there , there had been , since Lily 's last visit to the McClellans , certain additions : over the table hung an old Vanity Fair cover , a photograph of Katherine Cornell and her cocker spaniel as Elizabeth Barrett and Flush , and a yellowed front page from the Sacramento Bee showing pictures of the Duke of Windsor and the English princesses . The headline read " KING EDWARD ABDICATES ! DUKE OF YORK WILL RULE . My Mind Is Made Up , ' Says King . " The words Sacramento Bee had been partly obscured with adhesive tape , in deference , Lily assumed , to Mr. McClellan , who had little use for the English but even less for the Bee . " I see you 're admiring my memorabilia , " Martha said from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not seen Martha since the Christmas parties , at which Martha had , night after night , in some indefinable way made a spectacle of herself . Although she had not been drinking and had done nothing extraordinary , it had been impossible not to notice her , as it might have been impossible not to notice someone runninga high fever , or wearing a cellophane dress . She hadp59the same look about her now : her long straight blond hair hung loose around her thin face , so tanned that her eyebrows looked bleached , and she had on what appeared to be a leotard and a long green silk jersey skirt which trailed after her on the stairs . " What in the name of sweet Christ is that get-up ? " Mr. McClellan said . " You been practicing your ballet danc-ing ? " " I have n't taken ballet since I was twelve years old , thanks to the fact that nobody in this family except Sarah would ever drive me to my lessons . I 've been reading . " " Nobody gives a goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tank suit . " " Everett , " Martha called imperiously . " Guess what I 've been reading . " Everett looked up . Throughout this exchange he had seemed to withdraw : Lily had watched him fish in his pocket for a cigarette , inspect the cover of a Reader 's Digest which lay in a chair , whistle between his teeth . " What , " he said now . " What have you been reading , baby . " " The Anatomy of Melancholy . It 's number twenty-two on the list . " " She asked me for a reading list , " Everett said as Martha started back up the stairs . " I gave her one from Stanford . She 's already read about half the books on it . " " Strange little creature , " Mr. McClellan said . " You upset her , " Everett said with apparent effort . Mr. McClellan ignored him . " Melancholia 's one study you do n't need any lessons in , " he shouted up the stairs . " You strange little creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added as Martha came trailing downstairs again with a swimming suit in one hand . " Poor old Everett , " Martha said indulgently.  |p6o  " Do n't be a fool , Everett . Now let that girl get suited up . " They swam in the river , striking out for the far bank and swimming downstream with the current , still running cold with late melting snow from the mountains . When Everett reached the bank he waded back out to where the shallow ledge dropped off into the channel and pulled Lily , still struggling with the current , across the ledge and up onto the bank . " You do all right , " he said , pulling himself up after her . " I always think I 'll get dragged under . " She did not let go his arm . He moved as if to push her back into the water and then caught her , laughing , his arms low on her back . " You better not , " she laughed . " Why not . " " You just better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had about it the authentic ring of teasing , of inconsequentiality , that had eluded her at Berkeley . She had known all along that she could do it with someone she knew . Delighted , she lay back over Everett 's arms and stretched her legs in the hot dry air . By contracting her stomach she could make it concave beneath the wet coolnessof Martha 's swimming suit . She lifted one leg and saw , besides the water still glistening on it , a long scratch on her left thigh , gradually turning bruised where Everett had pulled her across a submerged root into the shallow water . " You look good . " Everett touched the scratch . " I feel good . " " You have the prettiest legs , " Everett said slowly , " of any small girl I ever saw . " " I guess you like tall girls better . " There : she was still doing it.  |p61Everett  looked at her , not smiling , and she was struck by anxiety : in her ignorance of how the game was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . " I like you all right , " he said after a while , still looking at her . " I never thought about it until last night . " " Never thought about what ? " Everett said nothing , and she wondered if she had angered or disappointed him , wondered if it was possible that she could lose Everett McClellan , in the sense that you could lose people who were not your father or your brother . " I wish you would kiss me , " she whispered , feeling again that Everett was suddenly not Everett but a stranger , someone to be won . He kissed her , and she clung to him a long time , watching the oak leaves swimming against the sun and feeling the ends of her hair floating just on the surface of the water and after a while opening her mouth and pulling down the straps of Martha 's bathing suit , before his hand tightened over the scratch on her left thigh . All right , she whispered over and over , and after a while she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . When Everett finally said , again and again in a kind of triumph , you feel it ? baby feel it , she assumed that it had happened . Later the scratch on her thigh became infected from the river water and left a drawn white scar noticeable whenever her legs got brown , but she did not think of it at the time.  |p62Lily  , he whispered every time as he lay spent in the rising morning heat , but she hesitated , equivocated , wondered if she was really obliged to marry him simply because he had wanted and taken her . That was in June . In July , when she figured that she had been screwed ( the word , which she had heard Everett use in reference to someone else , pleased her with its crisp efficiency , its lack of ambiguity ) a total of twenty-seven times , they once had an entire morning to spend : coming back from the narrow strip of beach they waded in the irrigation ditches , knee-deep in the soft ditch grass and slow muddy water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were her father 's orchards : the pears hanging warm and heavy , dropping to rot on the ground beneath the trees , going brown and bruised and drawing flies , going to waste in that endless summer as she , thank God and Everett , was not . She let her dress trail in the water and ranp63splashing through the ditch with her eyes closed against the sun . Catching her , Everett rubbed her face and bare sunburned arms with the cloudy river water that bubbled from a supply pipe ; they laughed ( Everett you fool my sunglasses I like you for being so brown Everett baby so hard I love you ) and fell down again together , for the pickers were working the far orchards that week , and when she screamed beneath him , remembering that snakes infested the ditches , he neither told her that there was no snake nor told her that the snake ( if there was one ) was harmless , but picked her up and held her until she was quiet and until the snake ( if there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon she told Everett that she would marry him , and then she ran up to the house to change her dress for lunch . It seemed as inescapable as the ripening of the pears , as fated as the exile from Eden . She mentioned it , however , to no one ; scarcely thought of it away from Everett . Through day after summer day she moved as if sunstruck , dimly aware that any announcementwould disturb the delicately achieved decision which had been , really , no decision at all : only an acquiescence . Was it , after all , so inevitable ? The word why , once spoken out loud , could bring the pears all tumbling down . She would have to say that she loved him : it was the only incantationwhich would satisfy them , even as it would dispel her own illusions . Unspoken , it might still be true . Everett remained the flaw in the grain . His constant and incontrovertible presence intruded upon her , prevented her from contemplating the idea of him , from polishing that idea into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning Everett would be sitting there , reading the Chronicle ; he would call her several times during the day , and a suggestion , from Edith Knight , that she and Lily might go to San Francisco for the dayp64could throw him into such despair that he would call every half-hour , all evening , to see when they were going , what they would do , when they would be home . Every scene Lily saw seemed to include Everett ; all she heard was Everett 's voice , asking when they would be married . " I do n't know , " she said finally one morning on the river . " I mean I do n't want to think about it right now . " " When do you want to think about it ? Next year ? The year after ? " " Everett . Stop talking that way . I 'm nervous . All brides are nervous . " She had read in a magazine that all brides were nervous , and had wondered whether that might not be her only problem : an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common to all women . " If you could just leave me alone a little , " she added , hopeful that she might be right . " Leave you alone , " Everett repeated . " I want to marry you . I do n't know how many times I have to say it . " " Wait until the hops are down , " she said finally . " You 're too busy now , you know that . " " I 'm not too busy to tell people . Do n't you want to tell people ? " " No , " she said faintly . " I do n't . " " You have to . You have to do it now . " " I told them I 'm not going back down to Berkeley . So they might have guessed . " She had told her parents that she wanted to take a semester off ; as far as their guessing the other went , she had invested her faith in the extreme improbabilityof their guessing anything at all . Putting asunder the delicate balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have to tell them . Your father likes me all right . Although nobody 'd know you did , the way you act when they 're around . "  | " I 'm not demonstrative . " She picked up a white pebble and skimmed it across the surface of the water , angling it downstream to catch the drift . " I do n't guess you learned to skip stones like that at Stanford . " " Lily , " he pleaded , sitting up and grasping her shoulders . " Listen to me . " She traced an L and a K and half of McC on his chest with her fingernail , not looking at his face . " There 's no use talking to Daddy until he gets the fruit out of the way , " she said at last . But when all the pears had been shipped to the canneriesand the hops on the McClellan place had been down six weeks , she still had told no one . " I do n't think you want to , " Everett said finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ah , sweet . " She kissed the back of his neck , ran a finger down his backbone . " It 's not you . " " What is it ? " " It 's anyone . Sometimes I do n't want to marry anyone . Some afternoons I lie on my bed and the light comes through the shutters on the floor and I think I never want to leave my own room . " " You 'll have a whole house . Is n't that better ? " She patted his hand and looked away down the river . " It 's your father 's house , " she said finally , grasping at the nearest point although not the one she had in mind . " We 'll build another house if you want . Would you like that ? " " I do n't know . " She was abruptly weary of trying to talk to Everett at all . " I do n't think you understand what I mean . " He turned away from her . " No . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically as she would a headache , the weight of Everett 's vulnerability . " Of course I want to , " she said flatly . " You know I want to . " Although they agreed that she would have told Edith and Walter Knight by the time Everett came by for dessertthat night , she had not . Telling them , she whispered to Everett when she opened the door , was impossible . Acceptingthis as fact , he got up from Walter Knight 's table and drove Lily to Reno that October evening , the night the year 's first snow settled over the Sierra Nevada , and had her declared his wife in the name of Washoe County and the State of Nevada . The ceremony was witnessed by the wife and son of the justice : the son pulled on blue jeans , the fly open , over his maroon-striped pajamas ; the wife , roused unwillingly but dutiful , smiled drowsily and patted Lily 's hair . Not quite eighteen , Lily had the distinctimpression throughout the ceremony that her lie about her age would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tears , nothing irrevocable , only a polite misunderstanding among good acquaintances . Later , from their hotel room , she called down a telegram reading " MARRIED EVERETT NOW AT RIVERSIDE RENO HOME SOON LOVE LILY " ; whatever her extravagances , long telegrams were not among them . Everett called the ranch to tell his father , but Martha answered the telephone . Covering the receiver , Everett turned to Lily , who sat , still wearing the skirt and sweater she had worn at dinner , on the edge of the bed with Hotel Riverside embroidered on the sheets . " Martha 's crying . She says I 'm leaving her alone . " " You 'll be living right there . "  | " She says that 's not the same thing and I must be a fool to think it is . " Lily lay down on the bed and buried her face in the pillow . She wanted nothing so much as to have her father there , to be downstairs watching him shoot craps , lulled by the action , the play of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the silver dollars as he stacked them . Make it the hard way . " Maybe she 's right , " she said , her voice muffled . They stayed a week in Reno . Lily bought a toothbrush and a pair of stockings in a Rexall drugstore , located some white cotton underwear in a shop specializing in trick holsters and mesh briefs embroidered with the days of the week , and ran into a Sacramento girl , Janie Powers , in the Riverside lobby . Apprehended by Janie as she stood , that first morning , wondering whether Everett would think himself slighted if she ate breakfast without waking him , Lily could not at first think how to explain her presence in Reno ; as it turned out , she did not have to . " I 'm getting a divorce , " Janie caroled across twenty-some feet of lobby . " What are you doing ? " Although Lily could not remember knowing that Janie had even been married , she supposed she must have heard and forgotten ; she could never keep straight the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out to buy a sweater , " Lily said guiltily . " I 'm just up for a few days and I forgot an extra sweater . " " Never mind that , " Janie said . " I 've got dozens . Have breakfast with me . " Once they were seated , Janie launched into a monologue about her husband , who was being tres impossible ( " I ca n't even spend one night on the Californiaside of the lake or he 'll contest my residency , he 's got somebody watching me night and day " ) , and it was notp68until they had finished a second cup of coffee that she again asked what Lily was doing in Reno . " Nothing special , " Lily said , pretending to look for a clock . " Listen . I promised to wake up my mother . " Two days later , Everett saw Janie Powers sitting at a blackjack table in Harold 's Club and asked her to have dinner with him and Lily . ( " You darlings , " Janie kept saying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet little thing keeping it a secret from Janie . " After two whiskey sours and a bottle of wine , Janie was struck by " the irony of it : Lily getting married , me getting  --  anyway . Tres symbolique . " ) Other than Janie , they saw no one . Everett slept late in the mornings ( Lily seemed to have known , always , the way he would look and feel beside her in bed , a comfortableif not particularly electrifying thing ) and shot craps a little in the afternoons ; Lily got up early , careful not to wake him , and walked by herself up one side of Virginia Street and down the other , stopping always on the bridge to watch the ducks on the Truckee River . She had asked Everett , thinking it might be wifely , if she could get him some toothpaste or shorts or something ; he had looked at her a long time , laughed , and said that he could take care of himself . One morning she thought she saw the son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately into a coffee shop and began dropping nickels into a slot machine . Although she did not want him to see her , it seemed important that she see him ( had it , after all , happened ? ) , and after he had passed by she ran out and watched until he turned the corner , but could not be certain that he had been the one . All she could remember clearly was his voice , an Okie voice : Ai n't she the prettiest little bride we had all week , now . One evening they had dinner on the California side of Lake Tahoe ; another they drove at twilight over the Geigerp69grade to Virginia City and found , there in the cemetery on the hill , the grave of someone in Everett 's family . Francis Scott Currier : B. 183o , D. 1859 . R.I.P . 2000 miles from home , 11 miles from the Ophir . They played tennis twice , and Lily ate lobster , in the dining room at the Riverside , for the first time in her life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in Reno a distinct air of celebration , the flavor of a wedding trip . When Everett took Lily home a week after their marriage , Edith Knight presented him with a kiss on each cheek and Lily with a list of two hundred people who had been invited to the reception . A practiced saver of situations , she had already begun a scrapbook pasted with clippingsfrom the Sacramento and San Francisco papers . Each showed Lily in a white middy blouse , her Dominican graduation picture . There was even one clipping from the Los Angeles Times , headlined " Former Solon 's Daughter Wed in Nevada . " Everett seemed bemused not only by the clippings but by the prospect of the reception : he took the list from Lily and studied it , asked about a few of the names on it , seemed to forget , and asked again . " This is quite a large party , " he said finally . " You were the one so crazy to get it institutionalized , " Lily whispered absently , touching the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that in all the years she had known the McClellans , they had never , except for Sarah 's wedding , four years before , given a party . Even Sarah 's wedding , or as much of it as Lily could remember , had seemed oddly improvised , an affair which included all the accouterments of other weddings but remained , in some vital way , not entirely a party . " I just wanted to marry you , " Everett whispered.  | " Well , you did . " Lily raised her voice . " Where 's Daddy ? " " It 's such an off season , " Edith Knight fretted . " It ca n't be a garden party and it ca n't be a holiday party . If you 'd waited six weeks we could have used Christmas trees . Something festive . " " The bride , " Lily said , " is generally considered attractionenough . I said where 's Daddy . " Edith Knight shrugged . " In his office , I suppose . I do n't believe he 's left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the arrangements . No help whatsoever . " Lily stood outside her father 's office , then opened the door without knocking . He was sitting behind his desk , looking out the window toward the island bridge . Everett 's Ford was clearly visible in the driveway ; her father had known she was home . " Well Lily , " he said , turning away from the window . " The child bride . " " I see we got a good press . " " Lily McClellan . " He gave the dry laugh Lily recognized as forced . " How does that sound ? " The words seemed to hang unnaturally between them . Lily averted her eyes . Laughing again , Walter Knight walked around the desk and put his hand out , tentatively . " Well , " he said . Although it did not seem likely that he had intended shaking hands with her , his hand was there , and so Lily shook it . He did not seem to know what to do then , and patted her shoulder gingerly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she had been a long time in a far place , and then , apparently relieved to have hit upon the phrase , he repeated it . " It 's nice to be back , " she whispered , able neither to look directly at him nor to speak normally . " You 'll be closer to home than you would have been in Berkeley , actually . "  |p71Encouraged  by this view of the situation , Lily nodded . Her father smiled and patted her shoulder again . " The McClellans are old friends . " She said nothing . In view of a fact she had just remembered  --  thatEverett was a second cousin to Rita Blanchard , whose grandmother had been a McClellan  --  her father 's remark seemed obscurely pointed . The issue seemed confusedbeyond repair , and Lily , blushing , took a silver dollar from the pocket of her polo coat and began to throw it up and catch it . " It 's snowing on the Pass , " she said rapidly . " We had a nice time in Reno . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her father nodded gravely . She dropped the dollar , which Everett had given her one night when he was winning , and watched it roll across the floor . " Well , princess , there 's no place like Reno . " Walter Knight picked up the dollar and dropped it into her pocket . " For all the mortal delights . Now let 's see if we ca n't get a drink before lunch . You could probably use one . Or two . " She tried to smile . Although she had hoped , all week and even this morning , that her father would tell her not to worry and somehow take things in hand , she saw now that it would be more or less up to her . Whenever she thought later of that week in Reno  --  and she thought of it quite often that first year , thought of it while she sat at dinner , listening to the clock in the hall and to Everett 's father chewing ; thought of it in bed , and reached to touch Everett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not alone ; thought of it sometimes beforeKnight was born , when she had been so frightened andp72Everett so reasonable , bringing her , every morning , the flowers she did not know how to arrange , the words she did not know how to accept -- it was with a longing she could never quite place , a nostalgia neither entirely truthfulnor entirely imagined . It was as if the week had existed out of time , as if they might happen upon it again one day by accident and find the same limpid air , forever suspended there between autumn and winter ; the same faces in the Riverside bar ; the same wild ducks lighting down on the same rocks along the Truckee , although even that week they had been on their way south : everything untouched , impervious to erosion , not exactly shining and not exactly innocent but preserved exactly as it had been , absolute proof against further corruption . She had said to her father that morning everything she could have said : We had a nice time in Reno.  |p73Young  married , river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 942 when she learned she was pregnant the second time she knew the roles she should be playing . It had not seemed as urgent when she had only Knight . Knight 's birth had pleased Everett ; Knight 's birth had pleased her , once it had happened . In the six months since Knight 's birth , however , nothing had changed . China Mary took care of him , just as she took care of everything else that needed doing in the house ; Martha worried about him , just as she worried about everyone else . She would call up from Davis in the middle of the week . " That fever , " she would begin . " What fever ? " Lily would ask . " That 104 fever he had a week ago Sunday . What fever . Anyway . You do n't think it could have damaged his heart ? " " We had Dr. Dubois , " Lily would say . " Dr. Dubois . Dr. Dubois has been senile since shortly before he delivered you . Let me speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Knight was a small animal still too inert to be entertaining ; he largely ignored his presence , pausing by the crib upstairs only when he suspected Everett or Lily to be watching . Nothing about Knight 's arrival , in short , had changed the mood of the house : Lily continued to stay upstairs as much as possible , nervous whenever she was downstairs that she was intruding upon the family she continued to think of as the McClellans , a house guest who had stayed on too long ; Everett became every day more abstracted , the way , she saw , he had always been around his father . " If you do n't stop whistling through your teeth , " she had whispered one night after dinner , " I 'm going to start screaming . " " Everett has always whistled through his teeth , " Martha had interrupted ; it was impossible to say anything , when Martha was home from school , that Martha did not hear and work into an issue . " Whistling is simply Everett 's way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily 's lap , " of pretending to be reading . " Everett seemed to Lily to act himself only when they were alone , and Knight did not change that . They could lie in bed in the mornings with Knight between them and laugh , but that did not quite make , Lily thought , a family . With two children , however , she would have to make more of an effort . Nothing about her modus vivendi was appropriate to a young wife and mother of two : the doctor , quite inadvertently , made that much . clear . Examining her , he asked whether any of her friends had told her about Dr. Grantly Dick-Read . " I suppose you mean naturalchildbirth , " she said quickly , uncomfortably convinced , as she lay in ignominy on the table , that both the doctor and his even more disapproving cohort , the nurse , had divined the shameful fact she had only then realized : she had no friends . She had her family , she had the McClellans ; she had a neat leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of girls with whom she had gone to school , to which she could address Christmas cards . But she had no one with whom she might have sat around over coffee and compared obstetrical notes . It was a failure she had never before fathomed : she did not much enjoy the company of women . " Natural childbirth , " she repeated , stalling . " I 'm not sure I 'd like that . I was in labor thirty-four hours with Knight . " " That 's because you were afraid , " the doctor said genially . He was a young obstetrician recommended by Martha ; Dr. Dubois had retired . " I do n't know . " Lily wondered with some irritation how she had happened to think Martha an authority on obstetricians . The doctor patted her thigh , affably . " You talk it over with your husband . " The notion that she might talk over natural childbirth with Everett seemed only slightly less ludicrous than the notion that she might have already talked it over with friends , and when Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distracted by the vistas of social failure opened up by the doctor ; sat down on the wet steps of the Capitol Building , and tried to think exactly what it was that young wives and mothers did . For a starter , they did not sit around by themselves on the Capitol steps smoking cigarettes in the rain ; she was sure of that . If they found themselves downtown after an appointment in the Medico-Dental Building they would have swatches to match , War Bonds to purchase , friends to meet for lunch . They would have an entire circle of friends with whom they lunched regularly , played bridge , talked about nat/ural childbirth and saddle-block anaesthesia and twilight sleep and the last time the Lunts played Memorial Auditorium . Deciding as she drove out to the ranch that the first step toward social regularity might well be the proper equipment ( she could not think what else it might be ) , she wrote immediately to Shreve 's in San Francisco and orderedsix hundred sheets of pale blue letter paper monogramedL.K.McC. , four hundred lined envelopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both Everett and the Post Office and one which she thought had a good deal more innate style than the Star Route number Mr. McClellan persisted in using ) , six hundred folded notes ( with matching envelopes ) engraved Mrs. Everett Currier McClellan , and something she had seen described in Vogue as a " hostess-saver , " a small book similarto one used by Mrs. Roosevelt 's social secretary to recordthe preferences , disinclinations , and favorite menus of all one 's guests . On the day the package arrived from Shreve 's , she set up a card table on the sun porch , filled Everett 's fountain pen , arranged a tray with a glass of iced tea and a fresh package of cigarettes , and set about writing some notes . Unable at first to think where to begin , she located the neat leather address book and turned the pages methodicallyfrom A ( Alice Adamson , an unattractive but popular girl with whom Lily had once shared a room at a Stanford house party and had never seen again ) , through the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Zenith Jewelry in Berkeley , where she had once left a bracelet to be repaired ) : there was no one to whom she could reasonablywrite a letter . By the end of the afternoon , nonetheless , using rather larger than normal handwriting and in one case askingp77for a recipe she did not want ( Baked Alaska made with cottage cheese would be beyond , she could not help feeling , even her expanding horizons ) , she had managed to write three : one to her roommate at Dominican , a girl she had not felt one way or another about ; one to the rather sententious widow who had been housemother in the Pi Phi house the year she was at Berkeley ; and one to Martha , who had not been home from Davis in eight days and had twice called Everett and urged him to write . Although the box of folded notes remained untouched , she had a definite purpose in mind for them : invitations . Starting with luncheons and afternoon desserts , she would progress to mixed entertainments  --  cocktail parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McClellan could not turn them awry ; simple but perfectly done , suitable wartime entertaining . " My mother is a great hostess , " she explained to Everett as they drove to the post office to mail her three letters . " When Daddy was in the Legislature she was possibly the most noted hostess on the river . Now . There 's no reason why I ca n't give a simple little party . Is there . " Everett , his eyes on the road , could see none . " Let 's stop for a drink before we go back , " Lily said happily . " Let 's have a drink by ourselves in a roadhouseor something . There 's time before dinner . " All right , Everett agreed drily , kissing her hair at a stop sign , they would have a drink in a roadhouse or something . " To celebrate , " she added . To celebrate , he repeated after her , smiling , although she could see that he was not entirelysure what they were celebrating , or why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then abandoning them in periods of retrogression , she opened the box of folded notes and wrote out eighteen invitations for a luncheon one afternoon in May . Everett put up card tables on the verandah for her , Martha called from Davisp78to encourage her ( as well as to suggest that the unprecedentednumber of people might upset Knight ) , and for a few hours that afternoon the McClellan place had about it the illusion that someone other than Lily lived there , someoneused to casual friendships , at home with the sound of women 's voices , luncheon forks , bridge being dealt . But although Edith Knight declared after everyone else had left that it had been the loveliest afternoon possible , Lily knew that it had not quite worked . It was nothing she had done or not done . It was simply that there existed between her and other women a vacuum in which overtures faded out , voices became inaudible , connections broke . With increasedapprehension but unalloyed determination , she set about correcting it : if she was incapable of having a circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when she discovered that Everett 's disinterestin her friends or her lack of them was equaled only by his disinterest in seeing his own friends with any regularity ( did he have any friends ? she sometimes wondered ) , she was at a loss as to what to do next , and when her father died in June she had every reason not to do anything . The single luncheon , the handful of letters and telephone calls , the Sunday-night supper to which Everett had finally agreed and at which no one , not even Martha , could think of any conversation that quite caught on : she could repeat none of it . She would become a wife and mother later , for as she said to Everett in the terror of the day she found out , I 'm not myself if my father 's dead.  |p79A  man and woman from Chicago discovered the accident : they had been told at the Texaco station downtown in Sacramento that they might get a breeze that hot June night by taking the river road instead of staying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Highway Patrol ) because of the curious light rising off the river . Tired and bored and sticky from sitting all day in the car , his wife said at first it was another California trick , and wanted to go on . Five would get you ten there was another Giant Orange drink stand involved in it somewhere , and for her nickel you could take every Giant Orange drink stand between here and San Berdoo and sink them five feet under . He parked the car , however , and got out to stand on the levee . When reconnaissance of the terrain turned up no evidence of a Giant Orange drink stand , his wife became apprehensive ( it was eerie , she said , it was so creeping eerie ) , and would not get out of the car . It tookp8ohim three or four minutes to apprehend what anyone from the river would have known immediately , for this was a bad curve , frequently miscalculated , or at any rate frequentlyas that kind of miscalculation goes ; to realize that the glow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlights of a car . The light filtered up through layer upon layer of current and crosscurrent , and flickered all about the channel as the wind disturbed the surface water . If I told her once I told her twenty times , there was something funny going on here and it was up to us to see what was what , the man said again and again to the state patrolmen , his curiosity already transmuted into the sense of civic responsibility which would become , in future tellings , the leitmotif of the story about the night they were someplace in California and saw this light Melba claimed was a Giant Orange , which is a kind of drink stand they have out there shaped like a giant orange . It was well after midnight before the river salvage people could get there from Yolo County with a hoist , and nearly five o'clock before they knew enough to call Edith Knight . She drove into town alone , a silk robe pulled over her nightgown , to identify the bodies . Because the accident had been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight 's face , unmarked , bore only the featureless look of the recently drowned . Rita had been cut , across her left cheek and down that long Blanchard throat ; she had been thrown , they said , against the dashboardbefore the car hit the water . Her long hair was still wet , and Edith Knight wondered , irrelevantly but obsessively , if it would dry before they buried her . She did not see how it could dry in the grave . Although she asked the coroner 's emergency attendant if it could , he did not seem to know . A small man possessed of a large curiosity aboutp81people under stress ( an interest which relieved the general tedium of his work ) , the attendant took advantage , however , of this opening : he wondered , probing delicately , if the lady with the beautiful hair had been visiting Mrs. Knight and the late Senator . The late State Senator . " Miss Rita Blanchard has lived all her life on ThirtyeighthStreet , " Edith Knight said sharply . " She is from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she added magnanimously , " which crossed the Great Plains a year before my own . " " A great tragedy , Mrs. Knight , " the coroner 's assistant said , abandoning the opportunity to pursue Sacramento Valley genealogy further and reaching instead for her hand . " A tragic loss . " ' " The Lord gives it and takes it , Mr. Paley , " she said , turning away from his outstretched hand . By the time she left the morgue the sun was completely up , and the heat rising . She drove directly to the McClellan place and found Lily in the kitchen . " Oh Christ , " Lily whispered . " He 'll never have the marmalade . " She had gotten up at dawn to make pear marmalade for her father before the heat came up . The marmalade was a kind he especially liked , from a recipe of his mother 's , and she had planned it as a surprise . She had gone to the ranch the day before to get the pears from Gomez . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shown him what ? " Edith Knight asked , but Lily did not answer because she had put her knuckles against her teeth to keep from screaming and had slipped down beside the sink to the linoleum floor . Shaking but not moving in any other way , she stayed there until Edith Knight pulled her to her feet , untied the apron she was wearing over her nightgown , and led her upstairs to Everett , who was shaving . Later the doctor gave Everett enough pills to keepp82her quiet for two days and Edith Knight said she had never , never in her entire life , seen anybody react the way that child reacted to a death in the family , she had always been morbidly sensitive and frankly it would have been better if they had gotten the pills before they told her , they might have known it would happen and she of all people should have known Lily was not strong enough to cope with the things other people had to cope with , but when do you think at a time like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha , together , managed to get Lily dressed . She sat on the edge of the bed , staring at the floor while Martha went through her closet . She had nothing which approximated mourning except a black silk suit she had bought in Berkeley ; now , six months pregnant , she could not fasten the skirt . " Everett said it did n't matter what I wore , " she said again and again , and finally , after her mother and Martha had conceded that it did not , she put on a maternity skirt , a pink and white flowered blouse that her father had once admired , and , an afterthought , a black lace mantilla . She looked , Martha whispered to Everett , like a stray from The Grapes of Wrath . It was another bad day , close to 108 at eleven o'clock . Lily sat between her mother and Everett in the car , her composure so precarious that she could look at neither of them . " I feel stronger every minute , " Edith Knight announced , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she added , pulling off one of the gloves and twisting a large ring from her finger . " I meant for you to have this some day anyway . " Lily slipped the ring over her wedding ring and closed her eyes again . It was a diamond her father had given her mother the day she was born.  | " Thank you , " she said . " I do n't know . " Edith Knight lifted Lily 's left hand and appraised the effect . " You 're really too young . " " She 's really too skinny , " Everett said . " She 'll lose it . " " I want it , " Lily said , opening her eyes ; it was the first unequivocal statement she had made in two days . They did not have a Catholic funeral . Because only a handful of the Knights were Catholics in the first place and because even their Catholicism was more an accident of birth or marriage than an act of faith , the family was not troubled by the Episcopal service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch , where no one had been buried since 1892 . " I do n't care if he was brought up Catholic or brought up Hindu , " Edith Knight had declared . " I guess I know where he 'd want to lie . I guess I know that much . " From all over the Valley and from the Sierra foothills the family came ; everyone from the river came and everyonefrom town came . Gomez and Crystal came , the Governorcame , and the bartender from the Senator Hotel came . As if she were immune to grief , love , all the transient passions , Edith Knight stood throughout the funeral withoutmoving . Lily stood behind her , looking away from the grave toward the distant line of cottonwoods which marked the river . She had thrown the mantilla back from her hair because it seemed to draw the heat ; now it lay , fallen from her shoulders , on the ground behind her . She could not stoop to pick it up . There was a certain comfort in the unkempt graveyard . Dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken years before from the stone angels guarding the rusted wire gate ; there was about the place none of thep84respect for death implicit in a well-tended plot . Once , a long time before , Walter Knight had brought Lily to see this graveyard . He had made her trace out with her finger the letters on the stones , the names and their dates , until she found the small , rough stone which marked the oldest grave . Matthew Broderick Knight , January 2 , 1847 , until December 6 , 1848 . The baby had been the first of them to die in California . It was a favorite story , passed on from Knight to Knight and documented periodically in the historical supplements to the Sacramento Union . Born in Kentucky , the child had begun to burn with infant fever on the way west . Another child in the party had died of it , and that mother had carried the dead child in her arms for three days , telling no one , afraid they would bury her baby before they came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he died instead in a room in Sacramento that first winter , while his father , Lily 's greatgreat-grandfather , was building the first house on the ranch . His mother , twenty years old that winter , was derangedfor months , believing herself at home in Bourbon County even as she hauled buckets of Sacramento River silt to cover the hardpan around her raw house . She wanted to grow a garden of forget-me-nots and love-lies-bleeding and the dogwood she remembered from her mother 's kitchen stoop , but as summer broke and she began to feel herself again she planted those same alien poppies and lupine that grew on the child 's grave . By the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down , she had ordered cut into the gravestone , but that had been when she was ill . The symbolicnature of Amanda Broderick Knight 's first garden on the ranch was , for the Knights , this story 's raison-d'etre . " I think nobody owns land until their dead are in it , " Walter Knight had said to Lily , playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allp85he was giving her was the official family line , Lily could not help but be disarmed . She answered in the same rich vein : " Sometimes I think this whole valley belongs to me . " " It does , you hear me ? " Walter Knight said sharply . " We made it . " She had never doubted that . The grave was covered by noon . Her arm through Everett 's , Lily sat in the car , twisting the diamond on her finger and watching her mother . Edith Knight stood in the dry grass by the wire gate and received : accepted as her due the certified recollections , the ritual testimonials which serve as visas into that comfortable territory where no dead man is less than noble . You remember when Walter came up that summer , ' thirty-three , we were in the middle of a crop and there was all the trouble and Walter sent in his own men and cleaned up the crop . You remember how Walter held the note on the Hawkes place all those years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember now . Remember . The litany of Walter Knight 's shining hours continued until one o'clock , long after most of the mourners , including Mr. McClellan and Martha , had left for Rita Blanchard 's funeral in town ; Edith Knight stood impassive and triumphant throughout . Were they not attesting , after all , that he now belonged to God alone and that she , Edith , had sole rights to his relics in this world ? Two weeks later , the lawyers notarized her victory . In 1933 , Rita Blanchard , needing cash , had sold to Walter Knight 12o frontage feet of a downtown block which had been in her family for eighty years . Although his will providedthat this parcel be returned to Rita , their simultaneousdeaths meant that it now belonged to Edith . To the lawyers , the family , and to the reporter who was writing up the disposition of the estate , she announced that she wanted the sizable income from that property placed annuallyin a University of California scholarship fund top86be administered by the Department of English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing I will remember about poor Rita to my dying day , " Edith Knight explained , " it 's that Rita was a reader . " Because the entire estate went to Edith ( passing to Lily at her death and held throughout both their lifetimes in a loose trust which would vest in Knight at some point after his twenty-first birthday ) , she could now afford , in every sense , to dispose of Rita with that grand gesture . ( The impact of the Rita Blanchard Scholarships was somewhat weakened , however , when it became apparent a month later that Rita had left half the Blanchard estate to Lily , the other half to be divided among sixteen cousins , including Everett , Martha , and Sarah McClellan . As Martha said to Everett in the Blanchard lawyer 's office , you really had to grant that round to Rita. )  |p87There  were roses ( so many for September ) and late poppies : the room was full of them . Everett must have brought them in from the ranch . No matter what way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropping their petals in the closed gray room which looked exactly like the room they had given her when Knight was born . Somewhere among the roses were jasmine gardenias , sweet and heavy as the drugs . The nuns would not open the windows in the storm . The rain had begun the night before she started labor and was still falling ; she watched it washing down the narrow windows all that morning . When she closed her eyes she saw rain beating the leaves from the camellias around the house . It must be raining in every part of the world , flooding all the valleys : she was certain that her baby had died in the night , that the nuns were concealing the death from her , and she knew as well that before long she would begin to hemorrhage and die her/self . She had recently read A Farewell to Arms and now she cried to think of Everett walking out of the hospital into the rain like Lieutenant Henry . Everett had come yesterday . When she woke from the drugs he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for several minutes without speaking . The San Francisco papers were spread on the floor around his chair . He had been reading three or four papers all that year , since before Pearl Harbor . Although she tried every few days to read a paper through , she seemed always to have come in too late on any given action to understand that day 's plays . After a while she had tried concentrating only on the war in the Pacific , which as far as she could gather America seemed to be losing . Although this did not seem entirely credible , it seemed , winning or losing , more credible than anything about the war in Europe ; what the war in Europe so notably lacked , for Lily , was a Pearl Harbor . As Mr. McClellan had said the morning of Pearl Harbor , when Martha ran downstairs wrapped in a towel to tell them , " That tears it . " ( That was all he said , and he did not say that until he had shouted at Martha " You keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to fry yourself , " but he spent the rest of the day pacing up and down in front of the house , scanning the sky and muttering to himself . ) Until Everett had explained to her that the Germans and the Japanese were pledged to defend one another , a point which had eluded her for the first two weeks of the war , Lily had been at a loss to understand what the United States was doing in Europe at all . The Pacific , of course , was another case . It did not please her to think , as she had thought , that this baby might have been conceived the morning of Pearl Harbor . It was not propitious.  |p89Everett  , yesterday , had been looking out the hospital window into the rain . The lights seemed to be just coming on outside . It would be about five o'clock , she supposed , and there would be lights in all the windows down ThirtyeighthStreet . Only Rita Blanchard 's house would be dark ; the house had been empty since the accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , to her and Everett and Martha and Sarah and thirteen other people , but mostly to her . Everett had talked a few weeks ago to a man who wanted to buy the place and have it rezonedfor a day nursery . That would be the day . Painted wooden rabbits on Rita Blanchard 's lawn . " Tell me what 's in the newspaper , " she said finally . Everett was always trying to tell his father what was in the newspaper . Because Mr. McClellan neither read the papers ( none of them , he said , carried anything but pictures of that crew in Washington ) nor listened to the radio , his many ideas about how the war should be conducted were based almost entirely upon information given him by Everett . Once he had absorbed two or three facts , usually tangential , he would cut Everett off by saying that it was no news to him , he knew those yellowbellies and all their tricks like the back of his hand . Everett folded the newspaper and smiled . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands to her stomach . It was still swollen . " You need n't whisper . Where 's the baby ? " He came back in a few minutes with one of the nuns , who held the baby wrapped in pink flannel . " A girl , " she said . " That would have pleased Daddy . " " It pleases me . " Lily turned her head on the pillow so that she could see Everett 's face . " Listen , " she said . " I was all right this time , was n't I. "  | " You were fine . " She lay back . " I ca n't feed it , you know . " " They 'll feed her . " " It 's funny to hear you say her . I do n't even know what we 'll call it . " " You said Julia . Julia Knight McClellan . I thought we decided that . " " I just said that because of my grandmother . I never really thought it would be a girl . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's entirely too small to call something like Julia Knight McClellan . It sounds like a suffragette . " " She 's big for a baby . " Everett turned to the nun . " Did n't you say she was big for a baby ? " " Everett , I know . She 's a regular King Kong of a baby . " " Listen , " she added after the nun had left the room . " We 'll have more . We 'll have about six . And Martha can have about six . And they 'll have these terrible fights because there wo n't be enough land to go around . " " And Sarah . Do n't forget Sarah . " " That 's right , and Sarah . " She had in fact forgotten Sarah . " Anyway . There 'll be this one runt . Likable but you know , a loser . He 'll be conned out of everything but some little back piece with no water . Then one day while the rest of them are playing golf  --  they 'll be forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's scratchingaround his place , you know what happens then ? " " Gold . " " Everett , baby . You live so in the past . It turns out his piece is the only exit for one hundred miles on a proposed transcontinental freeway . " " A freeway ? " " An exit , Everett . Standard Stations . Motels . Piggly Wiggly Markets . Long-term leases . " Everett smiled  | " Listen , " she said . " I behaved this time , did n't I. " Everett sat down by the bed and took her hand . " Yes . " " I did n't get scared and make a lot of trouble . I meanall the way through it was all right this time . " " You did n't make a lot of trouble before . " " I did . Your father told Martha he hoped I never got pregnant again because I was impossible . " " Who told you that ? " " Never mind . I was , that 's the point . " " Martha did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . It was better this time , you saw . " " It was fine . " " You have to take care of me , " she whispered . He held her hand and looked out the window a long while . " I will , " he said . " I do . Do n't I. " Although she had thought for a moment that she had never been so happy , Everett had left when her mother came ( " I meant to come earlier but I was downtown , " Edith Knight said , remotely bewildered , the way she had been since a few weeks after the funeral ; despite a new vicuna coat and an absolute lack of any visible defect in her grooming , she presented a curious impression of disarray , twisting her rings , smoothing her hair ; straightening the sheet as she kissed Lily goodbye ) , and after her mother left Lily was alone . The nuns had begun their evening visits , walking the corridor in pairs . When one paused outside the door , the light blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , pretending to be asleep , and as she watched the street lights blur through the blown branches outside the window she wondered how the nuns had known , and if they had once been as she was now . She thought of her mother , who by now would bep92sitting alone with a tray in the living room at home , pickingat her inevitable lamb chop and watching the same rain . Rain seldom fell so long so early ; if it kept up there could be floods before Christmas . Once when she was a child a levee had broken on Christmas Eve , and the churches were filled with tired women in raincoats and children in blue bathrobes . At Edith Knight 's insistence she had given all but one of her unopened Christmas presents to the evacuated children , whose own , Edith Knight had explained , were floating over to the poor Chinesechildren . Put that way , it had seemed an ideal situation , one in which only Lily came out behind . Although Everett should have eaten with her mother tonight , eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not have thought of it . And her mother was so lonely that she seemed to have lost even the idea of corn-. munication . " Some nights when the wind comes up I think I 'm the only person alive on the river , " she had said a few weeks ago . " Why do n't you call me ? " Lily said . " Why do n't you call me or one of the Randalls ? " " I could , of course , " her mother said without interest , as if Lily had introduced a quite irrelevant topic . In a sense she had : there was little that Lily or the Randalls or anyone else could do to mend the web of concern which Walter Knight and Rita Blanchard had woven around Edith Knight for a dozen years and had torn apart in June . It had once occurred to Lily that her mother missed Rita more than she missed Walter Knight ; it had been Rita , after all , who provided her with her role , who might well have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight 's failure ( dead or alive ) but of Edith Knight 's strength in the face of it . Well , her mother had chosen her role , the nuns theirs . But how did they know . How had Mary Knight known . Mary Knight Randall had entered the Sisters of Mercy thep93summer she was eighteen . She had gone to Europe with her father , Walter Knight 's cousin , and when they got off the boat in New York that August she told him that she did not intend to go to Berkeley in September . Althoughhe tried to reason with her all the way across the country on the train , even promised that she could have a new robin's-egg blue Ford convertible and spend the entire month of January skiing at Aspen , Mary Knight entered the convent the same week Lily went down to Berkeley . It was the week of rushing , and because Mary Knight had planned to be with her , Lily had a double room alone at the Durant Hotel . She lay awake every night , listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself , partly because she did not know how to talk to the golden girls from San Francisco and Pasadena but mostly because she had been deprived of Mary Knight , who was older than she was but had never known anything at all , had moved through adolescence in an untroubled innocence which had obscurelyreassured Lily , made her want to have Mary Knight with her always , a talisman . ( Once at a beach party , Joe Templeton 's younger brother , Pete , had tried to get Mary Knight up on the bluff in a car with him . " Why do they want to do that ? " she whispered later to Lily . " Never you mind , " Lily said , throwing sand on the fire . She had dislikedPete Templeton for trying and loved Mary Knight for not knowing . ) Even the Catholics mourned Mary Knight ; Helen Randall , who had refused to go to Europe with them because she wanted to go to Banff , still put the blame on Mary Knight 's father . Mary Knight was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to those morbid European cathedrals it simply would not have happened . He should have taken her , as she , Helen , had suggested in the first place , to the Calgaryp94Stampede . Now there was a portrait in the dining room of the Randalls ' house , hung as prominently as if it were of someone dead , Mary Knight at sixteen , absurd but oddly indomitable in a pink tulle dress . Mary Knight , her mother , the nuns in the corridor : they all seemed to know something she did not . Well , she had at least given Everett what he wanted . Even Martha could scarcely have given him two children . But she could not escape the uneasy certainty that she had done so herself only by way of some intricate deception , that her entire life with Everett was an improvisation dependent upon cues she might one day fail to hear , characterizations she might at any time forget . Except when she was in trouble ( when her father died , or when she was pregnant with Knight ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not , nor was he , a teller of anecdotes or gossip , and some- - times whole weeks passed without their having what could be called , in even the crudest sense , a conversation . Usually in bed she pretended that she was someone else , a stranger , and she supposed that Everett did too ; when she did not pretend that she was someone else , she pretended that Everett was . The only times she did not pretend that either or both of them were someone else , she pretended that it had never happened before , that it was again that first time on the river . There had been about that first time a sharpness , a finality absent since . For a long time , even after she had done it hundreds of times , the fact that it had happened at all would come to her with a shock ; it had seemed improbable that anyone else could do it , and the hearsay knowledge that not just anyone but almost everyone had done it remained a persistent flaw in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had stumbled alone across the plains and found that everyone else had already arrived , by TWA . Even now , two years later , those fewp95minutes were more vivid than any since : she had lost neither the sense of wonder nor the sense of deprivation that the experience had not been uniquely hers . The summersmell of that morning , river water and sweat and the acrid sting of weeds breaking under them ( and that would always be summer 's smell ) , was stronger still than all the roses and jasmine gardenias in the whole of Mercy Hospital . I should have taken the Holy Ghost not Everett , she had thought when she woke this morning , and she had snapped at the nun who was trying to take her temperature . A pillowover her head , she had lain still all morning , lifting the pillow only to watch the rain outside . She should sit up and comb her hair , wash her face , put on the silk bedjackether mother had brought . Everett would come again this morning , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that it would be all right even if they could go back to that morning on the river and start over again ; because she could not put her finger on what was wrong it would only go wrong a second time . She wanted now only to see her father , to go back to that country in time where no one made mistakes . For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night . She had memorized those words at the time of her father 's death , had repeated them as she walked down streets and brushed her hair , as she lay in bed and as she drove the river road , and she repeated them now against Everett 's arrival.  | " You 'll get along fine , " Everett said , the morning he left for Fort Lewis . " You 're a big girl now . You wait . You 'll be all right here . Wait and see . " He spoke very low ; both Knight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to go , " Lily repeated . She could not view Everett 's enlistment as anything other than personal and possibly deserved retribution . Bataan might fall , Corregidormight fall , and the Japanese might occupy Attu and Kiska , but Everett could not have gone had she not failed him somewhere . " You have a son . You have a twomonth-olddaughter . Your father needs you . " Everett sat up on the edge of the bed and lit a cigarette . Although light now filtered through the shutters , they had not slept . After Mr. McClellan went to bed they had , between them , drunk most of a bottle of bourbon , and then Lily had cried ( partly the bourbon ) and they had lain inp97the dark awake , oppressed less by the parting than by some uneasy apprehension of how the parting should be affectingthem . " Lily , " he said . " You keep saying the same things . I want to go . " " I do n't see why . " " I waited a year . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't have to . You want to . You said you wanted to . " " All right . I want to . I do n't see any difference . " Lily lay without moving , her head aching dully . " I believe you want to die , " she said after a while . " All right . I want to die . Now I have to get up . " While Everett shaved she finished packing his bag , tryingdutifully to memorize the way his shorts felt to the touch , the particular color and translucency of his toothbrush . They seemed things that she might want , at some future point , to remember . Although she considered puttingon the same plaid skirt and paint-stained sweater she wore most mornings , she thought then of ships going out under the Golden Gate in fog , of Wake Island , of that hot golden summer before they were married , and pulled on instead the white cashmere sweater that Everett had given her on her nineteenth birthday . He was to take the Shasta Daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them close to an hour to drive there . Although Lily wished now that someone would drive over with them , all the goodbyes had been said already : Martha had come over from Davis for dinner , and had driven back before midnight to study for a midterm . ( " Daddy is of the opinion I 'm meeting all kinds of rich citrus growers from down South , " she had said at dinner . " When all I 'm doing is taking midterms and lendingmy clothes to rich citrus growers ' daughters so theyp98can go out with rich citrus growers ' sons . " Everett had seemed puzzled . " What do you want to run around with people from down South for ? " he had wanted to know . " Oh you know me , Everett , " Martha had said . " An old One-Worlder . " ) The house was perfectly still , and cold from the Novembernight . Chilled through , Lily stood in the hallway and ran her fingers along the grain of the stair railing . When she heard Everett on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left on the hall table . " Now listen , " he said . " I 'll write you tomorrow . Then will you please write me and tell me how you 're getting along ? " " Yes , " she said , her eyes fixed on the fireplace in the living room . The house downstairs had the same curious appearance it always had in the early morning , the look . of a house abandoned in an emergency years before . It was hard to believe there were not really dusty sheets thrown over the faded slipcovers , impossible to think that the magazines thrown on the tables were actually dated 1942 . " I 'll write you , " she added . " Every day . " " And try to get my father to slow down . " " Yes . " " And see people and get some sleep . Gain some weight . " " Yes , " she said . " I 'll knit you some khaki socks . " " Well . " He held out her coat . " The home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The home front . " She drove to Davis ; they scarcely spoke . She watched the road and he stared out the window . A light fog hung low on the river and the knotted , broken strings fluttered among the fields of bare hop poles . There had been frost in the night ; it would warm toward noon.  |p99Although  the train was due in fifteen minutes , there were only a few other cars at the station . They sat in the station wagon , the heater on and the windows steamed , and Everett put his arm around her shoulders . She said that the sweater made her feel pretty ; he said that she was pretty , pretty hair , pretty eyes , pretty arms . Be quiet , she said , pressing his arm . There was little now that she wanted to say , and in the end she did not say anything , because Martha came to the station . They saw her running down the platform , clutching a book and a bunch of yellow chrysanthemums , a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goddamn refugee , " Everett said , opening the door of the station wagon . " I was afraid I 'd miss you if I stopped to get dressed . So I just came . " " Lucky you did n't run across any rich citrus growers , " Everett said . Martha pushed the book and the chrysanthemums into Everett 's arms . Embarrassed then , she stood outside the car , looking off toward the station , her hands shoved down into the pockets of her raincoat . Everett opened the book and looked up at Martha . " It 's my copy , " she said . " I knew you did n't have one . " " What is it ? " Lily asked . Martha did not look at her . " A family book . " " The McClellan Journal , " Everett read . " An Account of An Overland Journey to California in the Year 1848 . " " Privately printed , " Martha added . " Imagine , " Lily said . Everett and Martha , she thought . Forward into battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findingon the walls of Martha 's room , when they had been children and she had been sent to play at the McClellanp100place , neither Degas ballet dancers nor scenes from Alice in Wonderland but a framed deed signed by John Sutter in 1847 , a matted list of the provisions carried on an obscure crossing in 1852 , a detailed relief map of the Humboldt Sink , and a large lithograph of Donner Pass on which Martha had printed , in two neat columns , the names of the casualties and the survivors of the DonnerReedcrossing . Martha 's favorite game as a child had in fact been " Donner Party , " a ritual drama in which she , as its originator , always played Tamsen Donner and was left , day after day , to perish by the side of the husband whose foolish miscalculations had brought them all to grief . ( In Martha 's re-enactments , the Winning of the West invariablytook on this unobtrusively feminist slant ; in another game , " Central Pacific , " the power behind the transcontinentalrailroad turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife Jane , and Lily grew up with the distinct impression , planted by Martha and uncorrected for years , that the eminence grise behind the California Republic had been Jessie Benton Fremont . ) It seemed to have been an ineradicable mote in Martha 's eye that everyone from whom she was descended had , unlike Tamsen Donner , gotten through , and when Lily told her that someone in her father 's family had traveled with the Donner-Reed Party as far as the ApplegateCut-off , Martha had been despondent for several days . As a matter of fact she had mentioned it querulously only a few weeks before . " You could lend it to people , " Martha suggested , her hands still in her pockets . " I mean it might be very in-spiring . " " It 's the nicest present you 've ever given me , " Everett said , getting out of the car and putting his arms around her shoulders . " The nicest anybody 's ever given me. "  |p101After  they had put Everett on the train ( " The train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran , Everett trying to take his other bag from Martha and Martha wrenchingit away , to the platform , where Everett kissed first Lily , then Martha , and then a small girl who had wandered , carrying an American flag on a stick , from a family at the far end of the platform ) , Lily and Martha sat in the car , not speaking , until the train began to roll . Tapping an unlighted cigarette on the dashboard and humming " The Battle Hymn of the Republic , " Martha had seemed , until then , in trance . When the train whistled , however , she jumped out of the car and ran again to the platform , calling Everett 's name , looking in all the windows as the cars gathered speed , and then she walked slowly back to the station wagon , her raincoat fallen open and her pale blue nightgown trailing through the leaves that blew across the concrete parking lot . " Get in , " Lily said . " We 'll get some breakfast . " " He left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what counts . " Martha looked away . Lily saw that she was crying . " They 'd only have died on the train , " Lily said . " Youput them in your room . " Martha slammed the door closed . " I think I 'll go over home with you . " " I thought you had a midterm . " " I do . " " We 'll get some breakfast , " Lily repeated , turning the ignition key . They stopped at a drive-in near the Davis campus . Martha talked animatedly for a few minutes about the role played by Alice Lee Grosjean in the Long Administrationin Louisiana ( it seemed she was writing a paper about the Longs ) and about someone at Berkeley who had in/vited her down for the Miami Triad dance . ( It was to be at the Fairmont and she really wanted to go , except this boy had an unfortunate predilection for saying things like you 're the most terrific girl I 've ever known , and she really was n't up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . ) Then , abruptly , she stopped talking and began examining her fingernails , three of which were enameled a brilliant American Beauty red . " Everett said last night I should n't wear fingernail polish , " she said after a while . " So I started to take it off this morning but I was in a hurry and spilled the whole bottle of remover . All over Betty Jean 's V-Mail . " Martha giggled . Betty Jean , who was engaged to a Marine , was her roommateand current bete noire . According to Martha , Betty Jean saved on board money by eating cheese and crackers in their room instead of lunch downstairs ; the further economy was that she then saved the cheese glasses for her hope chest . Martha claimed that Betty Jean had twentysevencheese glasses , fifteen with red tulips and twelve with blue cornflowers . " It 's a pretty color , " Lily said . " Everett does n't like it . I told you . " Martha began drummingher fingernails on the metal trayLily did not say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally . " Yes . " " A whole lot ? " " Of course . " Martha looked out the window . " How much ? " " A whole lot , " Lily said , faintly irritated . " What did you mean about the boy who asked you to the Miami Triad ? Why do n't you go ? " " Daddy thinks I should get married . " " What 's that got to do with the Miami Triad ? "  |p103Martha  did not answer . " Who do you want to marry ? " Lily said . " I do n't know . Somebody . " Elaborately , Martha lit acigarette . " It does n't much matter who , does it ? " Lily shrugged , and after a while Martha reached infront of her and flicked on the lights to call the carhop . " I better take my midterm . " When Lily stopped in front of the dormitory , Martha opened the door but did not get out . " Listen , " she said . " Do you think I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you love someone . " " Come off it , Lily . I did n't expect you to talk like such a fool . Whoever loved anybody for more than two weeks . Except your own family . Or maybe somebody you 've lived with for years and years , I do n't know about that . " " There 's a lot of time . " " There 's a lot of time , ' " Martha mimicked . " There 's no time at all . That 's exactly the point . Everybody 's going away , and half of everybody 's going to die , and the war may go on twenty years , and Everett 's gone away  --  " " Anyway , " she added . " I 'm sure I do n't know who I 'd marry . I 'm sure I do n't know anyone who could take care of me . " " Maybe , " Lily said after a while , " you could marry someone you could take care of . Maybe that 's the same thing in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that she might well have happened , while fumbling through platitudes for Martha 's benefit , upon an actual fact , a profoundtruth : someone could take care of you or you could take care of someone ; you could be told or you could tell the comfortable loving fictions ( If you loved me you would steal for me , and tell me fairy tales of a happy land , it was , she thought , a German song ) , and in either case what was involved  --  all that was involved  --  was a commit/ment . Perhaps it did not matter much who made it , or how or why : it might very well be the same thing in the end . It does n't much matter who does it . Martha picked up one of the chrysanthemums and began rolling and shredding the petals into small balls . " Maybe it would be the same for you , " she said finally . " You 're so strong . " " I am not , " Lily said , jarred by Martha 's moodiness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a bit strong . " Martha shrugged and got out of the car . " All right , you 're not a bit strong . It 's your act , Lily baby , you play it any way you want . Anyway , " she added , " you 're strong enough to make people take care of you . " Even if Lily had been able to think what to say it would have been too late : Martha was already running up the walk , her hands over her face , running and stumbling on the lace hem of the pale blue nightgown , last year 's Christmaspresent from Everett , picked out by Lily , extravagantly expensive , handmade at Maison Mendessolle in the St. Francis Hotel . " We saw Martha this morning , " Lily said to Mr. McClellanat dinner . Although she had intended to stop by her mother 's on the way back from Davis , she had driven instead directly to the ranch , and had spent the rest of the day upstairs , aimlessly taking things from drawers and putting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bed , still unmade , the sprigged lawn spread her great-grandmother had quilted thrown down on the floor along with Everett 's worn sneakers , the November Fortune , and the bottle of bourbon they had almost finishedthe night before . Not until five o'clock did she go downstairs to see China Mary and the babies ; then shep105kissed Knight absently and carried Julie upstairs in order to feed her in the bedroom . Finishing the bottle of bourbonas she spooned Julie 's pureed carrots , she avoided Mr. McClellan for as long as she could and then felt guilty about even that : there she was , pointlessly depriving him of a small pleasure , the opportunity to watch Julie eating , one of the few activities ors her schedule animated enough to interest him . " I said we saw Martha , " she repeated . " She came to the station . " Mr. McClellan did not answer . They were alone in the dining room , absurdly cavernous , oppressively lined with glassed cabinets of crystal and china ; the shelves held two complete services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the McClellanshad not , to the best of Lily 's knowledge , entertainedmore than three guests at dinner on any given evening . Mr. McClellan had not spoken since the fruit cup , duringwhich Lily had said that she did not agree that the International Workers of the World were the principal threat facing the United States in 1942 . Apparently because he had seen mention of Tom Mooney 's name in an unprecedentedly thorough reading of the San Francisco Chronicle , Mr. McClellan had been brooding all day upon causes and effects . He guessed Miss Lily Knight , since she was so smart , knew every detail behind the 1916 PreparednessDay Parade bombing in San Francisco . No , of course not . Well here it was : ten people in their graves , thanks to anarchists and Wobblies . He guessed Miss Lily Knight knew all about the 1913 Wheatland Riot , three thousand hop pickers running amok , a tragedy so close to home it might as well have taken place on the kitchen stoop . No , of course not . Possibly Miss Lily Knight still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , knew the details behind such events , and was therefore in a position to know that wherever you found trouble in California today you had those boys to thank for it . Cherchez le Wobbly , Lily had suggested , and Mr. McClellanhad withdrawn into injured silence , broken only when he was moved to place his knife and fork side by side on his plate , wipe his mouth with his napkin , slap both hands palms down on the table and demand loudly : " What are laws for ? " Lily raised her voice now . " I said Martha came to the station . She 's upset about Everett . " Mr. McClellan cocked his head to one side , apparently to get a different light on the picture which hung on the wall opposite him , a large oil painting of a cornucopia . " What about Everett ? " he said finally . " His going away . " " She 's not a gold-star sister yet , " Mr. McClellan said , his voice flat.  |p107Their  communication did not improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain fell for what seemed weeks on end . Quite often Mr. McClellan would not speak at all , not out of any hostility but simply because the capacity for random conversation seemed to him less a grace than the certain expression of a weak mind ; other nights he would become quite voluble , usually on the subject of the county supervisor ( who was , he had come to believe , a paid agent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt ) , and then he would settle down after dinner with a copy of the California Penal Code , pouncing with intense delight upon certain loopholes and inconsistencies . He had first hit upon this diversion some years before , not long after Mildred McClellan 's death , and had regretted ever since , he told Lily , that he had not read for the law . Aside from the evenings when he read aloud from the Penal Code , their liveliest times together were spent playing hearts , forp108small amounts of money which Mr. McClellan almost inflexiblywon . If , after querying China Mary and checking the pockets of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change in the house , they played for toothpicks , redeemable no later than the next evening in cash . Nonetheless , they had between them a curious companionableness , a real , if not exactly infectious , rapport , most apparent to Lily on the occasional evenings when Martha came over from school and upset it . It did not seem to matter if Martha were calm or nervous , buoyant or depressed ( although in practice she seemed to come home only in states of aimless crisis ) : she invariably shatteredthe balance of reserve and aggressiveness which existedin the house when Mr. McClellan and Lily were alone with the children . Lily did not know what it was about Martha . She thought probably it was that neither she nor Mr. McClellan were what her father would have called " good company , " and that possibly Martha was . But in spite of the unexpected comfort Lily took in Everett 's father , it was still the sad season : Everett gone from the McClellan house , her father gone from her own house . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Knight could not play outside . In the afternoons Lily wrapped the children up and drove through the rain , past the eroded gullies where muddy run-off swirled along the ranch road , to see her mother ; in the evenings , no matter if dinner had been silent or combative or comparatively festive with the promise of hearts or the Penal Code , Mr. McClellan went to his room at ten-thirty , and Lily sat on downstairs alone , listening to the rain and night noises . At first she had tried turning on the radio , and had learned the lyrics to a great many songs including one called " I Spoke to Jefferson at Guadalcanal , " but after a while the radio seemed only to in-109tensify , with its impenetrable cheerfulness , whatever was ominous in the noises outside . Again during those first few weeks after Everett went away , she began to think of little but her father 's death . During the five months since it had happened , she had been distracted first by Julie 's birth , then by Everett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Sitting downstairsalone after Mr. McClellan had gone to bed she would take first her father 's point of view , then her mother 's ; then , more and more often , once Rita had been revealed to her in the role of victim , Rita Blanchard 's . It was not that there had not been something about Rita Blanchard from the beginning , some inability , some failure in her eyes , that marked her for Walter Knight . It was only that if he had wanted to love all of them and been capable of loving none of them , only Rita had really been deceived . Only Rita had put all her chips on that board . Although Lily wrote to Everett at Fort Lewis every night , there was little to say . She could not write to him about Rita Blanchard ; she had never even talked to him about Rita Blanchard . The babies and I miss you : that was what she could write to Everett . China Mary sings Knight a song about how you 're off to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights him no end . Julie has a cold from the rain . You must please write your father to do something about the furnace . I do not mind eating breakfast in two sweaters but it is the last straw when he declares the cold is good for the children because look what it does for a collie dog 's coat . Last night we played hearts and I won for the first time , although as it turned out I was sorry . The thing is we played with toothpicksagain , and because I won thirty-three cents I ended up with thirty-three toothpicks . Well . Tonight before dinnerhe appeared with a quarter and eight pennies and de/manded the toothpicks . I could n't think what I 'd done with them and he said in that case he could hardly be expected to turn over the thirty-three cents . I said all right , do n't , we 'd forget it , but he held up dinner an hour and fifteen minutes while we enlisted China Mary in a search for the toothpicks . Finally she found them in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentyeightleft . He finally gave me the full thirty-three cents in exchange for the twenty-eight toothpicks , but said he was setting a bad example and lectured me all through dinner on the importance of property rights and keeping one 's accounts in order . It was , he said , the American way and we could not begin too soon setting an example for Knight and Julie . It seems funny now that I tell you about it but it was nerve-racking at the time . I love you and miss you especially at night . The first week in January , there was at least some news : Joe Templeton came by after dinner and spoke to your father about buying the Braden place at Auburn . He 'll write you but your father hopes you wo n't sell . " Joe Templeton wants the Braden place , " she said to her mother the next afternoon . Their afternoons together had taken on an unvaried pattern : after Lily had put the children down , she and her mother would knit ; Lily for Everett , her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith Knight would resume a monologue about things which had happened some years before ; the details , for example , of how the Blanchards lost their river place on a note to a man named C.T . Godey in 1927 , or an analysis of a rumor , current in 1931 , that one of Lily 's second cousins ( once removed ) had been carrying on with a clarinet player in the orchestra at the St. Francis Hotel . ( It was an untruth , according to Edith Knight , although it was no surprise it got started because Elizabeth was prac/tically mental about jazz musicians and had once stood up in a speakeasy on Sutter Street with everybody on the river looking on and sung " Big Noise Blew in from Winnetka " with her arm around a colored drummer . ) Once she had become familiar with the names and the chronology , Lily found these accounts generally interesting ; she had never felt so close to her mother . Edith Knight put down the Peruvian face mask she was knitting for the bazaar . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . He did n't realize the piece was in Everett 's name . " " If the McClellans have the sense God gave them they 'll hang on to the Braden place . I used to go on picnics there . " Edith Knight paused . " Francie was n't with Joe ? " " No . He came alone . " " Alone , " Edith Knight repeated with satisfaction . " Of course he would have . " Lily did not say anything . Her mother began to hum tunelessly , tapping one knitting needle against the arm of her chair . Her eyes were closed . " Francie may have been outside in the car , " Lily said . " Actually he only stayed a few minutes . " " Oh no . " Edith Knight opened her eyes and started to work with fresh vigor on the face mask , intended for use whenever there was danger of frostbite . " I would n't think so . He was no doubt quite alone . " Lily did not know what she could say that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions . She rather wished that she had never mentioned Joe Templeton , and tried to think of some way to turn the conversation back a decade or two . " Did n't Francie Templeton have a sister who was n't quite bright ? " she asked finally . " That 's right , " Edith Knight said without interest.  | " She 's been dead seventeen years next month . " She continuedknitting in silence . " It 's Francie again , " she added at last , abandoning the hope of being prodded . " Helen Randall went up there one afternoon  --  Francie had invited her up , specifically invitedher for that afternoon  --  and Francie did n't even come downstairs . Joe made excuses for her . She starts in the morning with vermouth . " " Vermouth , is it . " Lily laughed . So often had she heard her mother say of someone who drank that he or she started in the morning with vermouth that she could not drink vermouth without a pleasant sense of discreet raciness ; thanks to Edith Knight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently made her day . Lily 's day could also be made by ordering stockings by the dozen rather than by the pair ; wearing expensive perfume around the ranch in the mornings ; and , among other things , focusingfor a fraction of a minute on some stranger 's eyes and making him look back just until , say , the traffic light changed . " I do n't know what 's going to become of those twins , " Edith Knight said , ignoring Lily . " They will no doubt grow up to be zoot-suiters . Look and see if there 's any sherry left . " Lily picked up the decanter and filled her mother 's glass . " On the other hand , " Edith Knight added , " there 's no need to pity Joe . He 's been quick enough to find comfort in the past . " Lily sat down again without saying anything . " If you understand what I mean . About Joe . " " Yes . " Lily picked up her knitting again . " I understand you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross . Lord no . But Joep113does n't exactly wear himself out carrying it , either . If you see . " " I understand , " Lily repeated . She had understood well enough . As had Joe . That had required no roman de la rose . Once the speculative glances and the accidental meetings were out of the way ( the procedure , she saw , was a way of doing rather than anything done ; first the miraculous awareness of the possibility , then the almost inaudible overture , the response so subtle as to be uncertain ) , they met in the late afternoons of that winter and in the long spring twilights , met in cars parked off the levee , bars frequented by Mexicans , and in an empty shack on the piece downriver which belonged to Francie Templeton 's mother . They did not talk much , and she was never certain that either derived from the other much pleasure , as that word is commonly defined . She knew only that they continued to interest each other . A tacit complicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other places and at other times ; Lily discovered that she could see Joe later any evening , or perhaps the next day in town , and not only behave as she would have behaved before but think of him as she had thought of him before . She had always thought him rather a likable fool ; she still did . She did not for the time being find it necessary to make frequent connections between Joe and Everett , whose letters came from Georgia now , and Francie lived in Everett 's country . It concerned , she thought , neither Everett nor Francie ; it did not even seem , in any real way , to concern her . When the nights grew warm , come May of that year , they occasionally met late at night . The wind blew off the river through the shack , its windows broken long agop114by children or transients , and they lay on a torn mattress and listened to the current . Once in a while she asked him something about the war , and he explained to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about something which had happened a long time before , a dance she had gone to or a slight she had imagined , but mostly they simplylay there in the dark in the bare room littered with dead wisteria , blown through the windows during a wind in April , and listened to the water . I love you , Joe said once , Lily Knight , and she turned away from him . " I mean now , " he said . " I meant I love you now . " " I know . " She twisted her shoulder free from his hand . " I knew what you meant . That 's all right . " " Lily Knight , " he repeated , drawing the sheet she had brought up over her shoulders . She sat up , pulling the sheet around her . " My name 's not Lily Knight . If you recall . I 'm married to Everett McClellanand he loves me very very much and nothing I do can change it . " Joe did not answer , and when he pulled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , and it was all right , possibly sharper and better and more interesting than it had ever been before.  |p115In  the beginning the afternoon was no more than a question of sugar , or the lack of it . China Mary had baked four cakes and given them as prizes in a parish raffle ; when Lily asked her what they were going to use for sugar during the rest of October  --  during the entire rest of 1944 , for that matter , since China Mary had traded some of their Novemberstamps to her sister for extra sugar  --  China Mary shrugged and continued whistling " Coming in on a Wing and a Prayer . " Good works , Lily wanted her to know , would cut no ice down at the OPA . It was one thing for China Mary to go around ingratiating herself with Father Ford ; it was quite another to do it with the whole family 's sugar stamps . There were some women in this world , announced China Mary , untying her apron and throwing it at Lily 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example that saint ( God rest her ) who had been Everett 's and Martha'sp116and Sarah 's mother  --  who would count God more important than a little bitty sugar . Thirty years she had worked on this ranch and no McClellan , not one , had ever tried to tell her how to run her kitchen , and there were some spoiled young ladies who were going to be punished by God if they did n't start thinking about their Church once in a while . " It 's not my Church , " Lily had snapped , aware that she was beaten : her error , as Martha observed immediately , had been the mention of Father Ford , who had personally brought about China Mary 's conversion and secured a place high on her personal hagiology by assuring her that Dennis Kearney , who with several hundred exclusionistfollowers had set fire to a San Francisco laundry operated by China Mary 's grandfather in 1877 , had probablybeen a bad Catholic if indeed he had been a Catholic at all . As Martha pointed out , Lily would never learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it through her head not to mention Father Ford . That was at two o'clock . At three Joe Templeton called , and at five-thirty he arrived with twenty pounds of sugar . Although Martha had been sick for two days , she came downstairs in a new pale pink robe for which she had paid sixty dollars a few weeks after she had met Ryder Channing at the Mather Field Officers ' Club that summer ; she had torn the white silk roses from the sash , and Lily knew , from that , from the grateful satisfaction Martha was takingin a low-grade fever , and from the way she talked to Joe about Channing ( " Captain Channing , " she kept saying , and referring to his slight limp as " something he allegedly got over Normandy " ) , that the affair must be running cool . Martha talked animatedly , laughed extravagantlyat Joe 's mild jokes ( " Joe , you 're too funny , you ought to be on radio , do n't you think Joe should be on radio , Lily ? Giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sounded more like Harry Hopkins " ) , and urged him to stay for dinner . It would be , she explained , a kind of cook-it-yourself operation , catch-ascatch-can , because China Mary was off brooding , but it would be scads of fun , she promised , and one thing they would have plenty of was sugar , one thing they definitelywould not run short on , thanks to Lily 's foresight and Joe 's mysterious resources , was sugar . As a matter of fact it was providential that China Mary had used up all their sugar and inspired Lily to call upon Joe , because they had nowhere near twenty pounds to begin with . That was the old silver lining for you , all right . With interest . Joe must stay . Joe could not . Joe was taking Francie and her mother out to dinner . Which was , Martha said , very shrewd of Joe . Taking Francie 's mother out to dinner . Making sure the bread stayed buttered , and all that . Anyway , she added , picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no wonder Joe did n't want to stay for dinner , the way this house was kept . Nothing but dead flowers in tasteless bowls , anywhere . " It was a bowl of my mother 's , " Lily explained as she walked Joe out to his car , but the incident seemed to have eluded him . " What was ? " he asked without interest , and then added immediately : " I met this Channing character . " " He 's quite a good friend of Martha 's , " Lily interrupted , annoyed at Joe 's denseness about the bowl of camellias . When she came back to the house Martha was lying on the couch , her face buried in a pillow . Lily pulled a comforterover Martha 's back , and sat down to finish the letter to Everett she had begun before Joe came . " You writing Everett ? " Martha sat up , throwing the comforter off.  |p118Lily  nodded without looking up . " I want to see if he ca n't come home for a few days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost every letter since his transfer to Fort Bliss in July , if he could not come home for a few days . In the back of her mind she was uneasily convinced that he could have gotten home , had he wanted to , between the time he had left Georgia and the time he had been due in Texas . Martha lay down again . " Some days I certainly ca n't abide Joe Templeton . " " Some days you certainly are rude . " " I mean sometimes I wonder where old Joe would be today if Francie did n't drink . I mean he absolutely trades on it , he 's made an absolute career of it . " She paused , watching Lily 's reflection in the mirror above the couch . " When really it 's just the other way around , " she added finally . " I mean I guess everybody on the river knows who puts up with who in that house . Who needs who . And it 's more than just her money . Her money 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know , " Lily said . " Well think about it a minute . " " All right . " " Now . Think about it right now . " " I want to finish this letter before dinner . " Martha pulled the comforter back up to her neck and resettled the pillow . " Tell Everett we 're eating Joe Templeton'ssugar , why do n't you . Tell him you 're sleeping around to keep us in black-market sugar . That should bring him . Write Everett-baby that . " Lily put the letter down . China Mary had been impossibleabout the sugar coupons . Knight had been running a fever ; Julie cutting a tooth . Martha and her father had fought at dinner every night for a week , and Joe had beenP119worried about Francie , who had sprained her wrist in a fall from a horse while she was drunk . Even that sure and quiet comfort had evolved into the garrulous ambiguity of friendship , a change that was probably irreversible ; when Joe had tried , a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkness by the car , she had turned her face away in irritation that he should try to so deceive both her and himself . Once they had admitted sugar coupons and sprained wrists , it no longer worked . She was too tired even to be shocked by Martha , let alone angry at her . " Martha , " she said . " Please . " Martha had begun to cry , tears welling in her fevered eyes and splashing down her flushed cheeks . " Martha , baby . " " You 've got no right to my brother , " Martha whispered , standing up unsteadily . " No right . " Lily was , then , less angry than frightened : harsh words between women seemed to her unthinkable , an irreparable rent in the social fabric . On those few occasions when she had quarreled with her mother , they had ended , both terrifiedof the consequences , weeping together . She thought now of the picture of Everett above Martha 's bed , the roses torn from the sash of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laude in June ( " Wait until Everett hears , " she had said . " He 'll be appalled " ) ; thought of Martha at Julie 's christening , Sunday before last , whispering out loud please help her to choose right every day she lives . Martha had held Julie , and none of the omens were good : the sky was overcast with the peculiaryellow haze Edith Knight called earthquake weather , Everett 's father jammed on his Stetson and walked out of the church before the christening because the minister had a favorable word for Harold Ickes , and Martha cried.  | ( She cried because Ryder Channing had not come to the christening ; she would have cried had he come . " That girl will have shed enough tears by the end of the year 1944 , " Mr. McClellan said before he left the church , " to drown the entire Jap army . She is what you call an untappedresource . " ) Lily had worn the silly John Frederics hat with the black veiling that had cost her mother seventy-five dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie was already beyond choice . The tellers of fairy tales knew about choosing what Martha did not know . An uninvited guest brings a gold ring or a spray of rue to the christening party . " Martha , " she called now , wanting to make it all right , but Martha had run upstairs . Later , she arranged a tray for Martha with a roast-beef sandwich and an artichoke , soaked in olive oil as Martha liked artichokes best . ( " Why ca n't she come down ? " Mr. McClellan demanded , ripping the leaves from his own artichoke and clearly regretting the lost opportunity for another few rounds at dinner . " Why does n't she just check into a hospital and stay there ? " ) She found Martha lying in bed in the dark , the blanket littered with damp shreds of Kleenex . " I did n't mean what I said . " Martha 's eyes were closed . " I did n't mean anything like that . You 're fine for Everett . Everett loves you . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed and turned on the light . The reconciliation made her quite as uncomfortable as the scene downstairs had ; things said out loud had for her an aura of danger so volatile that it could be controlled only in that dark province inhabited by those who share beds . Although she could sometimesp121say things out loud to Everett , she did not know how to talk to Martha . " My eyes are red . " Martha turned off the light again . " Everett thinks the sun rises and sets with you . You should realize that . " " I realize it . " " I mean you should realize how really simple Everett is . " Martha sat up in bed and fumbled on the table for a package of cigarettes . " You better eat , " Lily said . " Everything 's getting cold . " " You mean that cold artichoke and that cold roast-beef sandwich and that cold glass of milk . " Martha lit a cigarette . " Just a minute . How really straight he is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like anybody else , I do n't know , but the difference is Everett would n't ever explore it . All Everett wants is a little order . " " I guess that 's what everybody wants . " Martha lay down again . " Maybe everybody wants it . But most people do n't want it more than anything else in the world . The way Everett does . You might want it , I might want it . But when the opportunity to have it practicallyhits us over the head , we just about knock ourselves out getting out of the way . " She paused . " Take you for example . " Lily said nothing . " All right , do n't . Take me . What do I want . A nice ordered life right here on the river just like we 've always had . " " Joe says the war is going to change everything . " Snatchingat what had seemed for a moment a chance to steer the conversation away from the particular and into the realm of topics so impersonal and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten that Joe was for the time being a name loaded with peril.  | " Never mind about Joe . He read it in U.S. News &; World Report . Anyway . That 's what I want . But what do I do about getting it . I get messed up with Ryder , who not only does n't want to marry me , does n't understand any of the things I need , but is so unfitted to everything I want that I get so nervous I practically break into tears every time he 's in the same room with Daddy . That 's what I do about it . " Lily looked away . " I do n't know , " she said . She did not want Martha to tell her anything more about Ryder Channing . She had written Everett about how impossible Martha had been since she met him , had told him he had better come talk to Martha , and she did not know what else she could do . " I do n't even like Ryder , " Martha added , wadding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand , groping with the other for the shreds of Kleenex on the blanket . Lily took a tissue from her pocket and handed it to Martha . " I 'll get you some Luminal , " she said with relief . She did not like to see Martha cry but the conversation was at any rate closed . At twenty minutes to eleven , after Mr. McClellan had gone upstairs and left Lily to finish her letter to Everett ( I wish you would please reconsider about coming for a few days because neither your father nor I can talk to her and I do n't believe she has passed one day without crying since she came home in June , and this man , although he is quite nice , does not seem good for her , Everett , baby , please ) , Ryder Channing arrived to see Martha . " Actually she 's asleep , " Lily said , straightening her skirt as she took his raincoat . " I guess you know she 's been sick . "  | " I thought she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she noticed for the first time that he was about Everett 's height , about six feet . He would not have looked unlike Everett had there not been about his face both a hardness and a softness absent in Everett 's , the look of someone who has been in some sense spoiled . She supposed he must be older than Everett by four or five years , must be twenty-nine or thirty . " I thought she might feel up to driving into town for a drink . I 'm sorry . " He picked up a book from the hall table and opened it , pausing to read the inscription . " Maybe you 'd like to go . " " I should n't go out . Wo n't you have a drink here . " " Sure . Sure I will . " He smiled . She had thought before that he must calculate the effect of his smile ; its peculiar intimacy was a study in timing . It was something like the way John Wayne said " Hell-o there " when he first met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp or riding past on a horse . There was no mistaking John Wayne and there was , in a limited way , no mistaking Ryder Channing . " That 's real nice of you , " he added , smiling again , sitting down , and examining the envelope she had just addressed to Everett . Seeing that it was empty , he yawned , closed his eyes , and asked : " Where 's that drink ? " It occurred to her , as she got the ice , that John Wayne had the jump on Ryder when it came to follow-through . They had , in all , three drinks . At first Lily sat very straight on the wooden rocker by the desk ; after he had made a second drink she sat across from the couch , where he lay sprawled with one leg propped on the arm . He told her about Memphis , where his mother and sisters lived , and about Charlottesville , where he had gone to school . ( " You 'd like that , Lily . You 'd really like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he assured her in thep124Tennessee drawl that made everything he said seem a mild flirtation , made her feel that he had , in uncovering her previously unsuspected and more or less unprovable predilection for Charlottesville in the springtime , penetratedthe very essence of her . ) He praised Martha extravagantly ( she had , he declared , one of the quickest minds he had ever encountered in a woman ) ; asked to see a crayon drawing Knight had done ; and announced that the three of them  --  he , Martha , and Lily  --  must have dinnerat the Officers ' Club at Mather Field the following Sunday . Or some Sunday . They would keep it loose . Under his gentle prodding , Lily found herself telling him about the parties her mother used to give , about the time her grandfather had challenged a neighbor to a gunfight over a right of way which ( it turned out ) belonged to neither of them ; even about her father . It was the first time she had spoken about her father except in passing since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life on the river : he wanted to know why she had been sent to Dominican rather than to the union high school as Martha had been ; why they did not belong to the country club and whether anyone else on the river did ; why Walter Knight would not have been likely to belong to a San Francisco club , say the Pacific Union or the Bohemian . " He just would n't , that 's all , " Lily said , and it seemed to satisfy Ryder ; he appeared to index it under Growers , Social Eccentricities of , and went on to explore whether Walter Knight had known anyone who voted for Culbert Olson for Governor in 1938 . As they were finishing their third drink and Lily was trying to explain why she had not liked going to the San Francisco dances when she was at Dominican , Martha appeared on the stair landing , tying the roseless sash and smiling wanly.  | " I heard you all . " Whatever Martha 's malaise , it seemed to have so developed within the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railing . " I 'm sorry I did n't wake up before . " Channing swung his long legs off the couch and stood up , holding out his arms to Martha . " You poor sick baby . " He bent to kiss her neck . " You should n't be out of bed . " " I only wanted to say hello . " She stood there , neither sitting down nor taking Ryder 's hand . " Lily was telling me about the San Francisco Assembly , " Ryder said . " Did you go to those dances ? " " No . I did n't go to those dances . " " Martha went to school up here , " Lily said . " As you know . " " Listen , " Martha said . " I meant to tell you . Daddy said something real funny the other night at dinner . " " What ? " " Well , see , he wanted to ask me something about you . But naturally he pretended not to remember your name . That fellow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mississippi , ' I said . He 's from Tennessee . ' Mississippi , Tennessee , what 's the difference , ' Daddy said . It 's all Del Paso Heights to me . ' " Lily laughed . Del Paso Heights was a district north of Sacramento noted for its large Negro population and its high incidence of minor social disorders . " That 's very funny , " Channing said . He seemed obscurelypleased by the story , another entry under Growers , Eccentricities of . " He really said it , did n't he , Lily . " " He really did . I have to go up , " she added , kissingp126Martha on the cheek and taking Ryder 's hand . He smiled at her . As she walked upstairs she felt that Ryder was watching her , and kept her back straight . When she turned at the landing she saw that he was not watching her at all , but kissing Martha , pulling her very close , his hand at the small of her back . She wondered how Martha felt when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated . Not that it mattered . Everyone had his own shell game , and if Ryder Channing had known tonight how to make her feel open and happy for an hour or so , they had , in the end , conned each other . He would probably understand that . It occurred to her later , after she had undressed and turned down the sheets on Everett 's and her bed , that Ryder Channing might have been someone to whom , under different circumstances , she could have said things out loud.  |p127Everett  was playing poker in the Officers ' Club at Fort Bliss when they telephoned him on that Saturday after Thanksgiving , 1944 . Lily had already called twice that week , asking if he could please come home for Christmas because everything was falling apart without him . First the baby had been down with measles , then Knight had caught whooping cough ; there had been nothing but sickness since summer . I need you , she said . He could simply not understand unless he came ; he must come . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Martha he had better come . She was still intimating that she was about to run off with that Air Corps captain from Tennessee ; the week before Thanksgiving she did not come home for two days . She told her father she was in San Francisco . Which for all Lily knew she might have been but there was one vital detail missing in the version she told her father . ( Not that it was n't Martha 's own business , butp128she managed to make It everyone 's by making issues of everyone else 's faults . If she heard once more from Martha that Ryder Channing said she had " no conversation " she was going to start screaming , and if any of them heard once more from Martha that Ryder Channing thought the house looked like something out of Charles Addams , Lily simply could not be responsible for what Everett 's father might do . He objected to the way Ryder Channing wore his hat , without any stiffening , and referred to him always as " the fly-boy " or " the ninety-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where since everything else about the war was more or less escaping him . ) Anyway . Martha and her father fought every night at dinner until no one could eat , and then Martha would push her chair back and run upstairs . They could hear her crying at night and it upset everyone . She had in fact been behaving that way ever since she came home from school , so it did not in all fairness seem to have been brought on by Channing , but he was around all the time and when he was not around Martha was crying and it upset Everett 's father especially . Not that it took much to upset him these days . Everett could not realize . Someone had approached him about subdividingthe ranch after the war , and the man may have been rather unattractive and may even have been as Everett 's father said an operator and a draft-dodger , but Everett 's father still had no call to say the things he said to that man . There you had it . The children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing his mind . If only Everett could come . You do n't know how I need you . Lily 's letters and telephone calls had been the only disturbancein Everett 's life that summer and fall ; she seemed to have read none of the inspirational literature about building service morale , keeping the home fires burning ,  |p129I  'll be home for Christmas but only in my dreams . He missed her and the babies , but not as much as he told her he did , and then only in an abstract way . They were safe , and his absence from them was more than blameless ; it was blessed by all the Allied Powers . More than he could remember being since his first few weeks at Stanford , he was peculiarly contented within the ordered limitations of his life at Bliss . Desultorily , he played poker and struck up guarded friendships at the bar ; later , every night , he lay in bed and made new plans for the ranch : exquisitely rational arrangements , unmarred by the sloppy actualities of plans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went up to Dallas with another lieutenant , one of the group with whom he sometimes played poker ; the lieutenant called some girls he had known in college at Austin , and they all went dancing at the Adolphus Hotel . Although he could not later remember how , Everett ended up alone with a girl who had pale strawberry-blond hair and access to her father 's Cadillac . In the Cadillac they had driven out by a creek where they sat on the running board and drank bourbon out of paper cups and watched the sun come up , and the girl had made Everett feel her necklace ( it liked to be touched , she told him , because it was made of real pearls from Neiman-Marcus ) and had held his hand against her throat , but he had only kissed her gravely and driven her home . Later that morning , waiting for a transport he could hop back to El Paso , he tried to believe that it had been because she was a nice girl or at any rate because he was faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl alone for neither reason . He had left her alone because it was too much trouble ; on a small scale she might have disturbed the even flow of his days at Bliss even as Lily did . It was not that he did not like the idea of having Lily onp130the ranch , waiting : he did . Lily completed the picture , gave him the sense of having settled things , the sense he had missed before they were married . It was necessary , however , that things stay settled . During the past few weeks he had begun to regard Lily 's messages as definite intrusions , to look upon life on the ranch as a bacchanalia of disorganization , peculiarly female disorder . No one , so far as Everett knew , cried all night in the Officers ' Club at Bliss . He had explained repeatedly that Christmas was out of the question ; he had only a seventy-two-hour pass and transportation was at best uncertain . He would go instead to Mexico , although he did not tell her that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated over the telephone two nights ago , and he had answered in a blaze of righteousness : You do n't seem to realize there 's a war going on . Immediately he had laughed , trying to cover not only his pomposity but his deception . It must be clear even to Lily that El Paso was not exactly Leyte Gulf , and that getting to the ranch for Christmas would not be impossible . Now when the orderly told him that he had a call from California he felt the resentment return : they were forcing the issue , making him feel guilty . Annoyed with them all and with himself , he picked up the telephone ready to tell Lily once again that there was a war going on . " Is that Everett ? " He was abruptly charmed by her small voice . For a moment it was as if he had never gone away from her , never discovered the siren lure of celibacy . " Who does it sound like ? " There was a silence . " This is Lily . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and paused again . " Now listen to me . " " What is it ? "  |p131She  did not answer . He had stiffened , preparing himself for the last-ditch appeal , and now she did not make it , did not answer , said nothing . " What is it ? " he repeated , remembering suddenly what she had said about Martha . She said nothing . " Operator , " he said . Then , with some relief , he heard Martha 's voice , controlled and distant . " We 're at the hospital , " she said rapidly . " Sutter Hospital . Daddy had a stroke and you 'd better come home . " " Is he all right ? " He realized the idiocy of the question as he asked it . " Of course he is n't all right . He 's dead . Or we would n't have bothered you . " All that night he sat in the washroom of a Pullman car , smoking cigarettes and watching the green-shaded lights flicker on and off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He probably could have gotten a seat on a plane , but had not , even though Martha 's sharp , precariousvoice had finally broken : I said he 's dead , Everett , come home now oh Christ Daddy 's dead and let 's not have any more of that crap about how the lights are going out all over the world , Everett , please , come home fast . The train would be at least two days , longer should he miss the Los Angeles connection . He had wired his father 's lawyer to make arrangements for the funeral . He knew with certainty that although he might see Bliss again , he was as good as discharged now ; although he had in 1942 given up his farm deferment in order to enlist , there was no one now to run the ranch . He would ask for and certainly get a hardship discharge . That he would not see his father again did not really occur to him until he reached the ranch , six hours too late for the funeral ( he had missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flight at all ) , and found that Sarah had flown home from Philadelphia . " It was sudden , " she kept repeating to Everett , " it was terriblysudden . " " Yes , " he agreed each time , dimly reassuringher as he reassured himself ; they seemed to share some burden , the guilt of the children out playing when the trouble happened . It was all they shared . He had not seen Sarah since the day of her wedding , in August of 1936 . She had been married in the garden , in their mother 's wedding dress , to a boy named Peter . Although she had met Peter at Stanford he turned out to be from Philadelphia , a circumstance which seemed insurmountable to all the McClellans except Sarah . Seventeen years old , Everett had been an usher . He had gotten a little drunk on champagne ( Peter had not approved of the champagne , which was California ; it had been Peter 's conviction , expressed in company which includedtwo Napa Valley grape growers , that if you could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Scotch ) and toward the end of the afternoon , when Sarah was cutting the bride 's cake , he had told her and Peter a not very funny but very dirty joke . Peter had looked faintly annoyed . He never looked more than faintly anything . " I guess we 've had enough of the local vino , " he said , slapping Everett 's shoulder in what he seemed to consideran appropriately fraternal manner . " You ass , " Everett had said , and Sarah had thrown her arms around Everett , laughing and kissing him with white frosting on her mouth . She had been home twice since then , once beforeand once after the six weeks on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe which legalized the end of Peter , but Everett had been away that summer , working in a lumber camp out of Tacoma.  |p133Her  presence now , even the trace of her perfume that was all through the house ( the same perfume : it smelled again like the summer she was married , when the house was full of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed an event , a crisis , a death in the family . Sad and nervous , she walked aimlessly through the house straightening pictures , picking up plates and putting them back , opening and closing the shutters ; through her alien 's eyes Everett saw that what Lily had said was true : everything was falling apart . It would be a difficult spring . Lily had not exaggerated ; he had simply not wanted to believe her . Apparently his father had not been well for months before his stroke , and had lost interest in growing anything on the land he held so tenaciously . Everett could understand that ; he never blamed his father . When it came down to it , beyond making enough to live on , he had little interest himself in using the land . Like his father , he wanted only to have it . The Braden place was a case in point . It was two hundredacres , near Auburn , virtually untillable , deserted for years . It had been in Everett 's mother 's estate . Although Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell , ostensibly because he planned to develop it himself . He knew now why he had not sold the Braden place . He had thought about it in that Pullman washroom crossing the desert . He wanted , all of his life , to be able to go up to the Braden place and stand on the hill and look up the Valley to the Marysville buttes , and he wanted to be standing on his own land . It had nothing to do with crops , development , profit . He understood , all right , how his father , sick , could have let the river ranch run down . He had just dropped his guard temporarily , and there it went . Moved by this example , Everett was on guard , now ,  |p134armed  with the brisk decision , the semblance of efficient appraisal . Their Japanese foreman had been evacuated in 1942 , and his replacement , to whom Everett 's father had increasingly left the day-to-day operation , had proved incompetent . Everett had said , when they hired him , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father had muttered , disturbed more than he saw fit to admit by the relocation of the Japanese . " Those bastards asked for it . " It was typical of him to have thought that the loss incurred by an irresponsible foreman would be the government 's ; he had apparently never at any point seen that it was his own . On acre after acre , the redwood poles and wire trelliseshad been knocked down and left to rot with dead vines , unpicked the summer before . Part of last summer 's crop , the foreman told Everett , had mildewed ; in the shed Everett found , unopened , the copper sulfate which would have prevented it . Machinery , unreplaceable until after the war , had been left out to rust in the autumn rains ; the kiln was in no condition to use , the main road rutted . Even the levee was eroded , neglected all one year . The Army Engineers , as far as that went , were supposed to watch the levees , but Everett did not suppose that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the levee at McClellan 's Landing . " I kept writing you , " Lily reminded him , never looking up from her knitting . It seemed to him that she had been knitting steadily since his arrival . Whenever she caught him looking at her she would bite her lip , ostentatiously readjust her needles , and knit faster . He turned , wordless , to Martha . " I never noticed anybody letting me run this ranch , " she said . " I ca n't even write a check around here . " " We did everything we could , " Lily said . " Your father was n't asking for any advice from us. "  | " If only someone had let Everett know . " Sarah closed the box of old dance programs and pressed orchids which had claimed her attention since dinner . " If only someone had let me know . " " If only someone had thought . " Martha leaned to touch Lily 's arm . " Sarah could have forwarded us some pamphletsfrom the United States Department of Agriculture . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have n't seen Peter since 1939 . " " This new one then , " Martha said . " I ca n't ever think of his name . " " It 's on all my note paper , " Sarah said with an attempt at serenity . " Robert Carr Warfield , Jr . " She paused . " Bud , " she added doubtfully . " Bud . That 's it . Maybe you and Bud could have put your heads together and gotten this place in shape by air mail . " Lily put down her knitting and looked up at Everett . He understood : he had never meant to cast doubts upon their intentions . Nonetheless , he would be away another few months until his discharge was processed , and someonewould have to take hold . Could they do that , could they get the poles up and the fields cleared and above all could they get the Engineers to do something about the levee before they found themselves floating around the Delta ? " You tell the men I 'm running it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Templeton will help us , " Lily said . " Joe Templeton will help us , " Martha repeated . " Oh my yes . Old Joe Templeton will absolutely leap at the opportunity to help us . Yes indeed . Joe Templeton can be depended upon , Everett , count on that . " She had beenp136playing nervously with one of Lily 's knitting needles ; now she jammed it into a ball of yarn and walked to the window . Three days after the funeral Everett put Sarah on a plane back to Philadelphia ( " back home , " she said , apparentlyoblivious to the pain she could cause her brother simply by shifting the locus of her belonging ) , carrying a paper bag full of dried hops to show to her children and to the stranger who was now her husband . The hops had been Martha 's idea . " They 'll think I 'm bringing candy , " Sarah laughed , nervous as they stood in the rain at the gate . " I should have bought something , they wo n't realize I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she watched the propellers catching . Tentatively , Everett put his arm around her shoulders , thick in her black fleece coat , too heavy for California . She turned , smiling brilliantly and blowing him a kiss . " You come visit us , " she called as she ran to the plane , " come visit whenever you can . " After the plane had left the runway Everett sat in the empty parking lot , bent over the steering wheel of the station wagon with the rain blowing in through the open window and the strings of Christmas tinsel stars clinking in the wind between the low buildings , and cried for the first time that he could remember , not so much for his father as for Sarah 's defection , because she had lost all memory of the family they had been on that day when he got a little drunk on champagne.  | " Everett , " she said . " Everett . " He turned toward her , fumbling blindly through the wrinkled sheets for her body , meaning to draw her to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting only to quiet her . " Everett . Please . Everett . " He opened his eyes . Lily lay on her back smoking a cigarette . He had been home from Bliss six months now , ever since his discharge in February , and through those two seasons of 1945 he had not slept one night without the dim troubled sense that Lily was awake , shifting in bed , walking around the room or sitting by the window in the dark . ( She could not remember , she told him , a summer so hot : she had not been able to breathe for months . ) Not until he woke in the morning would she be asleep , sometimes in the chair by the window , her legs stretched out across the low sill and her nightgown fallen from herp138shoulders ; sometimes on the far edge of the bed , one hand flat on the floor , the other flung toward him but not touching him . She would lie for hours then without waking ; one morning he had sat on the bed and held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neitherclenching nor withdrawing her fingers . " Go to sleep , " he said now . " Go to sleep , baby . " " I have to talk to you . " He ran his fingers over the moist ends of her hair and across her face . Her eyes were wet . Jesus Christ . How many nights had he heard Lily crying . As some parents sleep through fire , thunderstorms , and voices at the back door only to wake at a child 's whisper , so Everett heard Lily crying at night . Her muffled sobs seemed to have broken his dreams for years . He had heard her even at Fort Lewis , even in Georgia , finally at Bliss . That was Lily crying in the wings whenever the priests came to tear up his mother'sgrave . Lily cried in the twilight field where he picked wild poppies with Martha ; Lily 's was the cry he heard those nights the kiln burned , the levee broke , the ranch went to nothing . " What is it , Lily . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He brushed the damp hair back from her forehead andkissed her closed eyelids , tasting the salt on his tongue . " I did n't want to tell you but I have to . " " What is it , " he said . " What do you have to tell me , baby . " He did not want her to say it . He had known for maybe three weeks , since that morning ( it was the morning the pump broke , the Monday after they had gone to Lake Tahoe with Marth and Channing ) when he had gotten up and found Lily sitting on the edge of the bathtub , her head down , her arms crossed as if she were having a chill.  |p139Her  nightgown was down around her waist and a glass of orange juice was spilled on the pink tile floor . Her hands were shaking , her eyes glazed ; he knew she had been sick . As he helped her back to bed it occurred to him that she was overdue that month . He was not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pulled the sheet over her , and while he tried to clean up the orange juice with toilet paper ( for some reason he had not wanted to leave it for China Mary to see ) he recalled that she had been sick on orange juice the first few months both times before . He had hoped ( so fiercely that it was a constant prayer , now after three weeks as automatic as breathing ) that he was mistaken , about the one thing if not the other , hoped that she would not say the words . But he had known she would . He had known all along she would wake him some night . I did n't want to tell you but I have to . He moved his arm beneath her shoulders . Her body was rigid . He would have to let her say it . He was the goddamn priest who would have to hear it . " I 'm pregnant . " Her eyes were shut tight , as if she expected him to hit her . " I 'm pregnant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as smooth and anonymous as a recording . She must have rehearsed the words so often that all inflectionhad been erased . He threw off the sheet and sat up on the edge of the bed , reaching toward the table for a cigarette , stalling less from shock than from a sense of anticlimax . Spoken , the words had lost their power . Lily had not moved . Well let her sweat it out . " You do n't think by me , " he repeated finally . She was sobbing convulsively now . " Any Mexican would know better . " He could hear the flatness in his voice . " Any West End whore . " " Leave me alone . " She was choking . " Just leave me be . "  | " Crystal on your mother 's place would know better . Crystal Gomez . Or whatever her name is . " He persisted only because he did not know what else to do , and thought she expected it of him . " What do you want , " she whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to say . " " Nothing . " His voice was gentler now . " I do n't want you to say anything at all . " She sat up suddenly , as if anticipating a trick , suspecting some incipient violence . " You want to know who it was , " she sobbed , almost screaming . You want to know who it was . He did not know whether she meant it as question or accusation . Without looking at her , he reached for the shirt and the pair of khaki pants thrown on the chair the night before . He supposed he knew who it was , if it mattered . He would rather it had been a stranger , someone who came and left . For it to have been someone he knew made the fault more subtly Lily 's : she had at once violated several contracts . That kind of thinking , however , did not apply . No kind of thinking that led to the word " contract " could possibly apply to whatever it was between him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger but it did not matter that it had not been . It might as well have been . " No , " he said . " I do n't want to hear it . I do n't want to hear anything more about it . " He pulled on the khaki pants and left the room , carrying the shirt and a pair of sneakers . When he dropped one of the sneakers on the stairs he did not bother to pick it up . Mostly because a light had been left burning on the sun porch , he sat down there on the edge of the rattan couch , one sneaker still in his hand , and wondered how long he had been asleep and how long it would be until dawn . P141He sat there the rest of the night , occasionally taking a swallow of bourbon from a bottle left on the table , staring blankly at an album of snapshots Martha had left out . She had been showing their pictures to Channing the night before . ( Channing , of course , had missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied a snapshot of Martha on a horse at eleven years old and remarked only upon the resemblance in pose to Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet ; had examined the pictures of Martha on the beach at Carmel and been struck not by Martha but by the cypress formations . " They just blow that way , Ryder , " Martha explained again and again with more patience than Everett thought either characteristic or necessary . " They just get blown that way and stick . " It had so irritatedand saddened Everett to see Martha spreading out their vacations at Carmel before Channing 's disregard that he had gone upstairs at ten o'clock . " Now , Everett , baby , " Lily had said , that deceptive mildness in her voice , " Martha 's baby pictures do not exactly constitute Mount Rushmore . " ) He saw a snapshot taken on the verandah of the Knight place when they were all children : Lily , he and Marth , and Sarah , holding Marth by the hand . It looked like a birthday party but he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Martha had becomesick from excitement . They had found her huddled in the corner of Edith Knight 's bathtub , the daisy wreath Sarah had made for her wilted and down over one eye . Everett smiled now , seeing that on that day they had all worn navy-blue reefer coats in different sizes . Knight had an identical reefer now ; Lily 's mother had bought it . He wished that he could go upstairs to Lily , tell her it would be all right , brush away the physical fact by making her laugh over the snapshot with the reefer coats . Redp142Rover , Red Rover , let Lily Knight come over . He could remember how Martha had sometimes kept herself hidden for hours when they played hide-and-go-seek ; how Lily , who had never liked being It , had never even liked games much , had sat down under the lilac once and cried because no one would come from hiding and it was getting dark . " I thought you 'd all gone and drowned , " she sobbed , hiccuping , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Martha had insisted on hiding . " I thought you 'd fallen in and been caught in a whirlpool . " ( The prospect of falling in and being caught in a whirlpool had always loomed impressively in Lily 's imagination ; he knew that she believed remotely to this day that whirlpools the size and power of the Maelstrom were commonplace in the Sacramento River . ) Somehow that day , he could not recall how , he had made Lily stop crying and laugh . He had intended always to take care of her , to make her laugh . But somewhere they had stopped listening to each other , and so he remained downstairs in a paralysis not of anger but of lassitude and pride . He had stopped being angry months before , if he had ever been angry at all : had passed through shock , hurt , and compromise already , and alone . Even then he had been hurt not so much by Lily as by his own failure to see . Have a drink with me , Everett , Francie Templeton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to see Joe about buying a used Ford pickup , but Joe was in town . " We 'll have a drink together this fine June evening becauseEverett darling , " Francie said firmly , " it 's about to be one dry summer . " She emptied an ice tray into a pitcher and picked up a bottle of bourbon . Reluctantly , he followed her upstairs to the terrace of the second-floor landing ; women whop143drank made him uncomfortable under any circumstances , and Francie fell besides into the category of women old enough to know better . " I so enjoyed talking to you the other night , " Francie said , dropping ice into two glasses . With an accuracy which surprised him , she threw one cube into the branches of an orange tree which brushed the terrace wall , tearing apart a spider 's web . " I enjoyed it too , Francie . " Everett was acutely uncomfortable ; in the moonlight flooding the terrace Francie looked even more haggard than she had looked downstairs in the lamplight , and the other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month before , on V-E Day , when he had drunk too much at a party down the river . " Walk me down to the water , Everett darling , " Francie had said about midnight that evening , and he had walked with Francie across the lawn and over the levee to the dock , had half-carried her down under the cottonwoods and big oaks and had sat with her there maybe half an hour , singing . Perhaps because he had been drinking as much as she had , Francie 's clear , slight voice did not seem in the least blurred to Everett , and she remembered all the lyrics to " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " and " The Yellow Rose of Texas " and even " There 'll Always Be an England , " a song which had alwaysinfuriated his father . On that warm May night with the lights on down the river and occasional strains of the Oklahoma ! score drifting down from the house and Francie'shead on his shoulder , Francie whom he had known all his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet and brave , a place of infinite possibilities for faith and honor and the grace of commonplace pleasures , and he was moved beyond any expressing of it by the worn words Oh beautiful for spacious skies , for amber waves of grain . Her shoes off , one foot trailing in the water , Franciep144had gradually dropped her head into his lap and stopped singing , fading out halfway through " There 'll Be Bluebirdsover the White Cliffs of Dover . " Thinking her asleep , Everett sat stroking her hair for a few minutes beforeshe sat up abruptly and began to untie the knotted silk halter strap of her dress . " Let 's go in swimming , Everett darling . " " It 's too early , Francie , " he kept repeating softly , sober enough to see that neither of them was in condition to swim in the river , " it 's still running cold . " As he extricatedthe halter strap from her fingers and began to tie it again at the back of her neck , she at first dropped her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs . " Do n't , Francie , " he said , getting to his feet and lifting her up ; she had begun crying then , her hands over her face and the big diamond she had inherited from her grandmother blazing suddenly in the spotlight from a passingcruiser . When he tried to take her hands and hold her she wrenched away . " Go screw yourself , " she had whispered , " that 's probably the only way you like it anyway . " He had hoped she would not remember it later , and had not really thought she would . ( The next morning he told Lily that while she was inside dancing he had been singing songs with Francie Templeton , and she had laughed : " Everett baby . That 's not much your style . " ) " We had quite a sing for ourselves , did n't we , " Francie said now , handing him a glass and touching it with her own . " To the old songs . " " That 's right , Francie . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she repeated reflectively . " On the Occasionof the Victory in Europe . A regular narrative by Norman Corwin . " She paused . " You think Francie 's changed since you went away . " " You always look the same , Francie , " he said quickly ,  |p145embarrassed  that she had caught him out . She was wearing an old denim skirt and a wrinkled shirt which probably belonged to Joe ; he knew that she must have been drinking most of the day . " Well , yes and no . " She poured more bourbon into her glass and waved him toward a wicker bench . " Yes and no . I 'm thirty-seven years old today . " " Happy birthday . " He wondered if she had a celebration in mind . " Ha . It 's not my birthday at all . I 've been thirty-seven years old for months . Now old Joe , " she added thoughtfully , " is forty . " Everett smiled gamely . He knew that Joe was thirty-six . Joe was ten years older than he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much with certainty because once Joe had come down drunk for a game at Stanford and collared Everett after lunch at the Deke house and explainedall through the first quarter how much they had in common , give or take ten years . One of the things they still had in common , Everett recalled , was fifty dollars Joe had borrowed that day because Francie had temporarily left him and transferred all the money in their joint checkingaccount into her private account , where she said it belongedin the first place . " Forty  --  years  --  old , " Francie said . " Or anyway he is almost . Sic transit old Joe , and all that . " " That 's right , Francie . " She was sitting on the low brick wall that edged the terrace , her body in profile to him , and he was nervous that she would fall from the wall and down one story onto the lawn . " Tell me about the war , " she said , swaying gently , almostcrooning . " Tell me about how you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Joe here kept the home fires burning . "  | " I appreciate Joe 's helping out after my father died . " He was uncomfortably aware that Francie had at some point passed beyond neighborly conversation . " Oh yes , " she said . " Oh my yes . Joe was helping out down there right along . " " Martha and Lily appreciated it . " Francie sat holding her knees with her arms , her eyes closed . " I 'll bet Lily did , " she said pleasantly . " He 's pretty good . " Everett said nothing . It did not seem possible that he had heard Francie correctly , but the words seemed to hang on in the warm air , as continually and unmistakably audibleas a prolonged high note on a piano . Although he had never been good at extracting subtleties from conversations , he tried , now , to imagine something else Francie could mean , to remember a word he had missed that would , once inserted into its proper place in the conversation , clear the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how she had been this spring ( had sat reading night after night until he had asked her to come to bed , had turned away afterwards every time all spring  --  what do you care , she had whispered once , what did you care when you were in Texas  --  had gotten up and brushed her hair and returned to one or another of a series of books on sacred architecture she brought home from the county library ) ; he remembered Lily and he considered Francie . " Or anyway he used to be , " Francie said in the same pleasant voice , unmarred by any trace of alcohol . " I would n't know any more . These days I 'm just old Joe 's cross , or you might say I 'm the curse that Joe was born to , his albatross , his middle of the night . His checkbook . You might put it that way . " P147Francie paused , chewing a piece of ice . " Because frankly , Everett , " she added finally , " I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservewhat could be preserved , extending his carefulness of heart , he remembered stories he had heard about wives in wartime , and how it meant nothing . It would mean nothing to him if he could stop thinking about Lily , and think instead of a generalized Wife . " You might even say I 'd rather drink . So you see . " Everett stood up . " I have to go , Francie , " he said gently . He had not seen , but he could not much blame Joe . He had not seen : there was the crux of it . He sat on the sun porch holding the picture of Lily and Martha and Sarah and himself in the reefer coats until the first light came through the east windows , as if by tracing his finger clown the crack in that yellowed snapshot he could recoup all their mortal losses , as if by merely looking long enough and hard enough he could walk back into that afternoon , walk back into Lily Knight 's house , holding Martha by the hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dock to where Lily cried beneath the lilac in the twilightand be home free.  |p148He  did not want to see Lily that morning , did not want to face her reddened eyes , her exhausted voice . You want to know who it was . She had placed the burden on him ; all that had happened was in some way his responsibility . When China Mary came to the house he asked her to take Lily a tray , no orange juice , and to see that she stayed in bed awhile . " She 's tired , " he said . " The heat gets her . Try to keep Knight and Julie out . " He left the house then for the south fields to watch the last hops come down . Although he normally came to the house for lunch , at noon he instead drove one of the trucks down to a bar on the highway and had two bottles of Lucky Lager and a bologna sandwich wrapped in cellophane . While he drank the second bottle of beer he listenedon the bartender 's radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fenway Park and did not think about Lily . By seven o'clock , when he started back to thep149house , the entire ranch was stripped bare of the vines . They had been picking all week , and this was the day he had liked least all of his life : the day the last hops came down , the day summer ended . All he could see as he walked back to the house were the bare poles , the broken strings hanging motionless in the heat , the dust stirred up by the picking machines . Tomorrow they would start the kiln , and during the next four or five days while the hops dried the whole year could go to waste . The kiln and the crop with it could go up in a flash of dry flame , and beyond taking the most elementary precautions there was nothing he could do about it . During the next week the agents from the insurance companies would be dropping by the ranches where the hops were drying , watching their risks ; almost every August a kiln burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Messner place , up the Cosumnes River , the night they were to have finished . Everett walked up to the house alone . Although it had been a custom of his father 's to invite the foreman and his wife to the house the night they finished picking , the new foreman ( Henry Sears was his name , he had come from down the San Joaquin , near Bakersfield , had arrived on the ranch a few days after Everett came home from Bliss ) had driven a truck full of Mexicans into town , leavingbefore Everett could have spoken to him , even if Everett had intended speaking to him . At any rate Henry Sears would not know the custom since he had not known Everett 's father , and anyway he had no wife . Everett did not know what he could have said to him if he had invitedhim . Everyone had always responded to his father : had liked him , disliked him , talked to him , talked about him ; had become in one way or another involved with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died , and every one of them had thought himselfP150involved with John McClellan . He would have known , as Everett did not know , how to talk to Henry Sears . Even Martha would probably know , but Everett did not . Everett did not even know how to talk to Lily . Althoughhe had no idea now what he could say to her when he got to the house , he would have to make it all right , at least for this week . At some point during the afternoon he had worked out an inarticulate pact , and had invested in it all his unthinkable prayers : should the hops come through the drying , the child she was carrying was his . It differed from the game Lily had taught Knight to play with the evening star only that in Everett 's game the odds were pretty much with him . Make sure it 's the first star you see at night , baby , and do n't stop looking until you 've finished the wish . ( " That 's Venus , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a star at all . A planet named Venus . " " I do n't think so , " Knight said politely , not looking away from the window ; one twilight he waited at his bedroom window fifteen minutes so as not to risk seeing another star first . ) Even before Everett reached the steps to the verandah he heard Martha 's laughter through the screened door and windows , and he heard in the particular pitch of that laughter the fact that Ryder Channing was with her . It was not that he disliked Channing . Channing in fact reminded him of Clark McCormack , his roommate at Stanford , and he admired their apparent easiness in the world even as he was vaguely troubled by it . Clark McCormack had seemed to Everett the center of a vast social network , the pivot for dozens of acquaintances , all of whom were constantlycalling or dropping by the Deke house : one to bring Clark the stolen stencil for a mimeographed midterm ; another to drop off a box of Glenn Miller records in anticipation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their convertibles for Clark to use . Like Clark McCormack , Channing conveyed the distinct impression that he could live by his wits alone . They were both free agents , adventurers who turned whatever came their way to some advantage ; both pleasant , knowledgeable , and in some final way incomprehensible to Everett . Channing had once told Everett that wherever he was he made a point of getting a guest card to the best country club . It was that kind of thing , something Everett could not put his finger on . Channing had no business around Marth . He might even be married : you never knew about people like Channing . He would have to talk to Martha ; he had meant to talk to her ever since he came home in February . " Everett ? " Martha called now from the living room . He had wanted to see Lily before facing Marth and Channing , and he hesitated , playing for time by looking through the mail on the hall table . There were two pediatricians ' bills , a notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bon Marche in Sacramento , and a report from the Pi Beta Phi Arrow Shop in Gatlinburg , Tennessee : all addressed to Lily . " Everett , " Martha called again . " Come here . " He walked into the living room , oddly conscious of the muscles moving in his legs . He was struck by the thought , although it did not sound scientific , that if he forgot where the muscles were he would be unable to walk . " Ryder brought us some good gin for a change and I 'm making martinis . " Everett did not look at Channing . " Where 's Lily ? " he asked with an effort . Martha was sitting with her back to him , her rather too long hair hanging forward over her bare shoulders . She had on some kind of sun dress which made her look paleP152and thin , and the hair did not help . Although he had alwaysliked it long she looked healthier when she kept it cut . " She 's in San Francisco , " Martha said finally , measuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning to get the train . The City of San Francisco was two hours late coming in over the mountains and that 's why I was n't here for lunch . I told China Mary to slice the ham , " she added . " Was it all right ? " " I was n't up for lunch . " He paused . " You say Lily 's gone to the City ? " " She just decided to go as long as it was so hot  --  you would n't believe how hot it was in town today , we saw Francie cashing a check in the Wells Fargo and she looked like wrath  --  and you 're so busy . Anyway she had to shop . She claimed she did n't have anything to wear to the Horse Show in case you took her to the Fair . " " The Fair , " Everett repeated . Martha looked up . " The Fair starts Thursday . Anyway . She said to tell you she was going to spend all your money at Magnin 's . " Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brother I 'm going to spend all his money at Magnin 's . " She staying at the St. Francis ? " " I would n't think so . " Martha handed Channing a glass . " I do n't know that she 's ever stayed at the St. Francis in her life . I mean has she ? " He did not know . He had thought of the St. Francis only because it was her favorite hotel in San Francisco : It makes me feel like violets , baby , violets and silver dollars from the Comstock Lode . All that tacky marble . " I mean I assumed she was staying with Mrs. Ives , " Martha added . " I did n't really think . She said she might call tonight or tomorrow . "  |p153Charlotte  Ives was Lily 's great-aunt , a widow who lived out in the Marina . Lily might be at the St. Francis and she might not , but she would almost certainly not be with Mrs. Ives . She said she might call tonight or tomorrow . Wherever she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was all that meant . He knew now that he should have expected her to do this , knew that he would pay all of his life for letting her spend this one hour in some nameless doctor 's office . If that was what she was doing , and he did not know what else she could be doing . She must have been ready to do it before she told him . She had tried him at last and found no help . It occurred to him suddenly that something could go wrong , that everything could go all wrong and they would never let him know . " What 's going to happen to Knight and Julie ? " He heard too late the uneven rise in his voice . Martha looked at Channing , who shrugged , stood up , and walked over to the window . " Now , Everett , " Martha said finally . " Knight and Julie are at this moment asleep . China Mary has fed them and I have twice recounted for them the story of the little engine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses of water , and perhaps you might  --  when you feel up to it  --  make certain that Julie has not misplaced her stuffed raccoon , which seems to do for Julie what Luminal does for Julie 's Mommy . Now I would assume that we could carry on in this vein until Mommy 's re-turn . " Everett saw that Channing was watching him , and forced himself to smile . He was irritated , as he frequently was now , by Martha 's tone : he was sure that if she could hear herself she would stop it , but did not know how to tell her that . " We got the last of the hops down today , " he said finally .   " All , " Martha said to Channing . " We celebrate the harvest , chez McClellan . " " Some harvest festival . " Channing smiled . " When the harvester wo n't have a drink . " " We call him the grim reaper . " Martha blew Everett a kiss . " You 're wearing too much lipstick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he watched her turn away , trying to bite the color off her lips , he was sorry that he had said anything . He picked up his drink . There was nothing to do now but wait for Lily to call or come home , get through the next day or so without letting Martha see that something was wrong , that everything had gone all wrong . She should have waited . He would have helped her . He swore to himself that he would have helped her had she waited . It might even have been his , and it would not have mattered much finally if it had not been . What real difference would it have made : it would have been Lily 's , and Lily was his , and as far as that went Joe Templeton was a distant cousin of his , distant enough for Everett to seldom remember it but close enough to think about now . They went to the same weddings and funerals , which was what mattered . " You should have gone down with Lily , " Channing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher . " You look like hell . " " The heat bothers Martha . " Everett wondered how much longer Channing would be at Mather Field now that the war was over . " It sure does n't bother that Lily-maid , " Channing said . " She has n't looked so good all year . " " She 's tired , " Everett said . " I do n't care how she looks to you , she 's tired and she needs a rest . " " She 's your bride , Coop. "  |p155It  was a great little thing with Channing , the Gary Cooper routine with Everett and especially the " that Lilymaid " business with Lily . When they had gone , the four of them , to Lake Tahoe three weeks before , he had kept it up all weekend , needling Lily unobtrusively at first but at last so constantly that it had begun not only to set Everett on edge but to humiliate Martha : Everett had watched her trying to divert Channing 's attention from Lily , the strain on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly , about things neither Channing nor Lily could know about , deliberately excluding them from recollections of how Sarah had behaved before her first dance , how China Mary had feared a Great Dane they had kept for three weeks a long time ago . But are n't we happy , Lily had said , and despite Channing and despite Martha they had been : he had not been away with Lily since before he left for Fort Lewis , and they drove to all the places they had gone so often during the first year of their marriage : Reno , Carson , down into Glenwood . In the shining clarity of that afternoon in the mountains , the air so clear and sharp and the horizons clean and distant , it had seemed to Everett for a while that they could have again what he had wanted them to have , could lie in bed and laugh , neither accusing the other of anything . Their betrayal of each other ( for had he not betrayed her in his mind , wished to stay away , wanted no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war going on ) seemed for a few hours that Saturday afternoon and evening a simple dislocation of war , a disturbance no more lasting than the wash from a stone thrown in the river . They had stayed Saturday night in a house which belonged to one of Lily 's cousins , a brown-shingled place on the north shore of the lake , and they had gambled on the Nevada line until about two o'clock in the morning . Although Lily would not play ( " Women do n't ever win , Everett , ca n't you see . Because winners have to believe they can affect the dice " ) , she stayed close to the table , watching over his shoulder , reachingnow and then into his pocket for a cigarette or change for a drink , playing idly with a stack of silver dollars he had given her but never taking her eyes from the play on the table . He had tried once again to explain the odds to her , but she claimed to understand nothing at all about the game : she liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips and the silver and the dice and the rakes the dealers used . Let the little lady roll , the dealer said gallantly ( it was a slow table ) , and Everett remembered now how she had leaned over the table and closed her eyes and thrown with one hand , come seven baby , while she clutched his arm with the other , delighted to be playing with the grownups ; she put two dollars on the line and her yellow sweater fell to the floor and she had been his child bride all over again . All that evening he had pretendedwith her , had played her game because that was the way he wanted it too , and later they swam in the lake , the water so clear that with only the moonlight and the handful of lights strung out on the dock he could make out rocks thirty feet below the surface , so cold that swimming was like grappling with dry ice . Lily had turned white with cold , her pale tan fading at the first burning touch of water ; long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone hearth , wrapped in a towel . He had found it absurdly endearing that she should warm her nightgown in front of the fire before she put it on . Keep me warm , baby , she had cried out later in bed , and he had forced her head sideways and her mouth into the pillow as she moved in his arms because he did not want Channing , in the next room , to hear her . Keep me baby please keep me . Well , he had not . He had lost her , and now she was in somep157San Francisco hotel room by herself and maybe it had happenedalready and maybe it had gone all wrong and she was dying there by herself ( women died from abortions , you saw it in the paper every so often , you heard about it , and whether the odds were with her or not she would be afraid of it ) and he was here drinking with Martha and Ryder Channing as if it did not matter what happened to Lily . It was all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; had she known , she would have kept Lily from going . But he had known all along , and he sat here now with Ryder Channing , and it was all mixed up in some way with the war , and Sarah 's not being home , and people like Ryder Channing . Not that it was Channing 's fault . The future was being made , he heard Channing say at some point that evening , right here in California . Starting now . Channing had the hunch they were in on the ground floor of the biggest boom this country had ever seen . Talk about your gold rush . And he was n't the only one who believed in Northern California . Just one example , the KellerBrothers believed in Northern California to the tune of five million berries . " The Keller Brothers , " Everett said . " I do n't believe I know them . " The Keller Brothers , Channing explained patiently , were developers . Los Angeles developers who believed in Northern California , in the Valley specifically , to the tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Natomas District . " I never heard of any Kellers in the Natomas , " Everett said . With what appeared to be infinite restraint , Channing inspected and crumpled three empty cigarette packages be/fore answering . " They are n't in the Natomas right now . They want to develop the Natomas . " " Who 's putting up the money ? How can they raise five million dollars on land they have n't got ? " " Those sweethearts could raise five million dollars with a plot plan on the back of a goddamn napkin . Anyway , " Channing added , apparently abandoning his effort to justify the Kellers ' ways to Everett , " that 's just one example . The point is we 're sitting right here on the ground floor with the button pushed go . " " Cut yourself in , Channing , it 's a free country , plenty of room for everybody . " Everett realized that he must be drunk ; he did not know what Channing had on his mind , but resented the " we . " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lap . Lily had not called ; he had known she would not . A few hours ago he had tried seven San Francisco hotels , the only seven he could think of , as well as the Claremont and the Durant in Berkeley . No one was registered as McClellanat any one of the nine . There had been a Miss Knight at the Mark Hopkins but when Everett got her on the line it had not been Lily at all . It had been some woman who wanted to know if she had met him with the National Cash Register boys and hung up immediately when he said she had not . Channing seemed not to have heard him . " The point is we need everything out here . Absolutely tabula rasa . Christ , within the next ten , fifteen years somebody could make a fortune in the agency business . " " You mean real estate ? Insurance ? " Everett made a determinedeffort to follow Channing . " Or automobiles ? " " I mean advertising . Advertising agencies . You think branch offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realize what we 're sitting on out here . " P159Everett had never known anyone who worked for an advertising agency , and although he had from time to time read articles in Fortune about Bruce Barton and Albert Lasker , he had no clear idea of what people who worked for advertising agencies actually did . When he thought of an advertising agency at all , which was not very often , he thought about Albert Lasker sitting around an office looking out into the falling snow and thinking about toothpaste , maybe even squeezing toothpaste onto a toothbrush . The next panel in his mind showed an electric light bulb over Albert Lasker 's head and the single word " Irium . " The falling snow was for some reason an integral part of the picture , and Everett had never considered it happening in California . Albert Lasker and Irium belonged to another world , a world teeming with immigrants and women who spent the day in art galleries and elevator operators who called you by name if you were a crack Life photographer . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator operator saying good morning to a crack Life photographer . They never called it Life but it was all part of the same goddamn world and it was always the same goddamn elevator operator . The elevator operator brought him back to Channing , who had claimed to be sitting on the ground floor with the button pushed go . Speaking of go , he began to wonder why Channing did not go home to Mather Field or wherever it was he slept and he began to wonder why Martha was asleep with her head in Channing 's lap . Pickingup her sweater from the floor , he moved to spread it across her bare legs . She shifted in her sleep , flinging one arm back across Channing 's knee . " Ry-der ? " she whispered . " Go back to sleep , " Channing ordered . Apparently reassured , she withdrew her arm . Everettp160dropped her sweater and poured what was left of a bottle of bourbon into his glass . They did not seem to be drinking martinis any more and there was only a puddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're like a goddamn radio announcer , " he said suddenly to Channing . " You 'd make one hell of a radio an-nouncer . " " Maybe so , " Channing said amiably . " Maybe I 'll look into it . " " Charm . That 's what you got , Channing , is charm . C-H-A-R-M . " He could not now think why he had turned on Channing , but because he was now , whatever the reason , more or less committed to it , he stood up , rocking a little on the balls of his feet while he watched Channing . Channing stood up , waking Martha , who lay rubbing her eyes with one hand and trying to smooth her hair with the other . " What is it , " she said , her eyes still closed . " Your brother , " Channing said , " could use a sandwich . " " Screw a sandwich . I 've just been telling your gentleman friend , in words of one syllable , that he 's not in your class . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her belt without taking her eyes from his face . " You shut your mouth , you hear me ? " " All right , " he said . " I 'm sorry . " She meant it , all right : he recognized that the tremor in her voice was not for Channing 's ears alone . She 's in thrall , Lily had laughed at the beginning of the summer . " Have n't you ever read in books about women in thrall ? Martha 's in thrall . " " What does that mean out of books ? " he had asked . " It means he 's the first man she ever slept with , " Lily said , not laughing then , and he had slappedP161her , had hit her across the face with all the revulsion he had felt that night on the terrace toward Francie Templeton . He 's pretty good . Or anyway he used to be , I would n't know . When he started upstairs Martha was still standing there with Channing . She did not move her eyes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she wanted Channing to stop stroking her hair but was not really aware he was doing it . For an instant Everett wanted to go back down and get her , tell her to pick up her sweater and a fresh bottle of bourbon and get in the car , tell her that they were going to San Francisco to bring Lily home . But he did not know where to find Lily , and he was afraid that Martha would begin screaming if he even paused on the stairs . He had not heard her scream since they were children , but it was a scream he had never forgotten , all panic and blind hatred , so piercing it was almost sweet , and as he looked down at Martha standing rigid in Channing 's casual embrace it seemed to him that he could almost see the scream beginning in her eyes . The bed was littered with things Lily had dropped when she was packing : her hairbrush , a satin case with stockings spilling from it , her book of telephone numbers , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked in the bag and found nothing but pennies , tobacco crumbs , a couple of the silver dollars she always carried ( " for luck , Everett baby " ) , and an old shopping list : Arden hand lotion , white socks for Knight , birthday for E. , two curtain rods for back bedroom , call Mother about platter . He brushed it all to the floor and pulled back the sheet . There was a note scribbled on a page from a calendar :  |p162Everett  darling I 'll try to make everything all right . Please . L. Well , no one could say Lily had not hit her stride with this one . Notes under the sheet . He crumpled the note and dropped it , then bent to retrieve it because he did not want China Mary to find it when she came to clean in the morning . He sat then on the edge of the unmade bed and absently rubbed the satin tie of Lily 's nightgown across his face and listened to the faint sound of the phonograph from downstairs . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't fence me in . . . Well to hell with Martha . Let her make her own bed . With a goddamn radio announcer.  |p163Kee|p  me baby please keep me , she had said that night with the fire down low and her hair still wet with the lake water : touched , Everett had accepted it as a trust . Or anywayhe had wanted to , had longed to believe that she meant it , even as he knew that it was something women said ; even as he remembered others who had said that or almost that . Not that there had ever been , for Everett , that many others : the first had been Doris Jeanne Coe , Doris Jeanne of the glass-blue eyes , the lank blond hair , the bad teeth , and the smile that seemed to Everett at sixteen infinitely perverse . Two years older than Everett , Doris Jeanne was behind in school not from native inability , which had never held anyone back in the county consolidated school system , but simply because she had stayed out of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 . Her mother was tubercular and Doris Jeanne , the oldestp164child , stayed home to help with her brother and four sisters ; their father used to be a farmer but now , according to Doris Jeanne , he fixed things , and Doris Jeanne thought California was strictly a drag . Everett met her the week she enrolled , when they were assigned to debate the topic " John C. Fremont : Opportunistor Patriot ? " She was wearing , he would remember always , a fuchsia-pink sweater with a harp embroidered in gilt threads over her left breast , a tight black gabardine skirt , and a coat which made Everett forever uneasy about Doris Jeanne , the coat about which Lily later said , when he told her about it one night in bed , " Did n't it make you cry ? Did n't it make you want to cry for the world every time you looked at it ? " Although he had laughed at Lily , there was little doubt in his mind that the coat had indeed lent his entire relationship with Doris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-me-down from someone for whom her father worked , it was a camel'shairpolo coat with an I. Magnin label , and she let it out of her sight so rarely that two of the buttons were missing and the pocket bore a year-old Coca-Cola stain . After class , Everett had stopped Doris Jeanne and asked her which position she preferred , a phrasing which affordedher a great deal of unconcealed delight . When Everett explained , blushing , that he meant did she want to argue John C. Fremont was a Patriot or did she want to argue John C. Fremont was an Opportunist , Doris Jeanne looked at him a long time , slipped the polo coat off her shoulders , removed from her large red shoulder bag a blue vial of Evening in Paris Eau de Cologne , and dabbed the stopper behind her ears and in the crooks of her elbows . Then she replaced the vial , snapped the bag closed , and asked Everett who John C. Fremont was . After he had told her , she smiled crookedly , arranged the bag onp165her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no never-mind , honey . " Mostly because he would have preferred it himself , Everett offered Doris Jeanne the " Patriot " position , and she eventually stood up before the class with her polo coat on , daintily applied Evening in Paris to her wrists in full view of twenty-four entranced students and Mrs. Nalley , the English teacher , and presented an original defense in which Jessie Benton and John C. Fremont emerged curiouslyas refugees from some early-day phenomenon not unlike the Dust Bowl . Although she had taken a clear fancy to the Fremonts , she could not escape the impression that they had first entered California in a secondhand Ford , and the entire exercise left Mrs. Nalley so unnerved that she excused her classes for the rest of the day . The debate was otherwise without incident , and Everett did not speak to Doris Jeanne again until the class picnic , when her brother , who played baseball with Everett , urged him to sneak off to the river and share a half-gallon of valley red with him and Doris Jeanne , who was included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase . After a while Alfred Coe went to sleep over beyond an Indian mound , and Doris Jeanne , with lifeless dispatch , took care of Everett . A few days later she cornered him in the hall at school , pressed up against him as he stood backed against his open locker , and began playing lovingly with his collar ; she wanted to do it again out behind the backstop during seventh period , when there were no teams on the field , but Everett hesitated , and Doris Jeanne said he was strictly a drag and could stew in his own juice . Later that semester , after the intercession of her brother , Everett wrote a term paper for Doris Jeanne on the subject " Will Semple Green : Father of Irrigation in the Northern Valley . " Unhappily neither Mrs. Nalley nor the vice-principalp166who was called in as arbitrator could be persuaded that " Will Semple Green : Father of Irrigation in the Northern Valley " was entirely Doris Jeanne 's work , and in the pressure of this controversy Doris Jeanne quit school . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel obscurelyguilty that he had failed to do a more convincing job for her . Several years later he saw a picture of her in the San Francisco Examiner ; described as a " curvaceous model and sometime waitress at an El Camino Real supper club , " she had instituted a paternity suit against a football player with a Polish name . Although she had changed her name to Dori Lee , Everett recognized the picture , and wondered if she would remember him . He thought not . After Doris Jeanne it had been nobody : necking in cars on hot summer nights with the back doors open so you could lie with your legs out and sometimes even lying almost naked and covered with sweat , but never doing it ; once or twice or three times even lying in somebody 's bed at parties given by boys whose parents were away , lying naked under the sheet with girls who had been drinking bourbon and Seven-Up and wanted to go to sleep , lying there for hours and kissing girls who probably would have done it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as Lily would have said , much his style . Then there had been , at Stanford , a couple of girls who required less insistence : Annis McMahon , whom everyoneelse called alternately " Annie " and " Pooh " but whom Everett always called Annis , wishing upon her the dignity implied by her tall , cold , blond good looks . He liked to watch her play tennis , and long before he knew her he developed the habit of walking back to the Deke house from his eleven o'clock class by way of the courts where she played every noon . When it reached a point where he thought he wanted to watch her play tennis for the rest ofp167his life , he asked Clark McCormack to introduce him to her . Once introduced , he called her three times a day , played tennis with her every afternoon , took her to the movies every Sunday night , and in May of his sophomore year , still determined that she should be the girl he had hoped she would be in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to Santa Cruz on two successive weekends . ( On the third , he found out later , Clark McCormack drove her down to Santa Cruz . ) They lay in a motel room with a mission tile table and a framed color photograph of Bridal Veil Falls at Yosemite , and she told him in the high nasal voice which had been his first disappointment about the difficulty she was having arranging her courses to obtain her teaching credential at the same time she received her degree in physical education and therapy . She got up from the bed every time as if she were getting out of a shower , ready , in a companionable way he found dispiriting in the extreme , to discuss it ; stretched her incredible golden arms , lit a cigarette , opened all the blinds , and wrapped herself in his shirt , a gambit which might have seemed more winning had his shirt not fit her almost perfectly . The next year there was Naomi Kahn , a Jewish girl from Beverly Hills whose grades were good , whose clothes smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact they had not : Naomi ordered all her clothes from Bergdorf Goodman in New York ) , and whose mother and father were both , as she put it , in the Industry . She told Everett that her deepest wishes for her mother and father involved their abandoning screenwriting in favor of writing something like Winterset , and when that day came she would be more than happy , in answer to Everett 's query , to stop ordering her clothes from Bergdorf Goodman in New York , although forp168Everett 's information , Maxwell Anderson was not exactly on the relief rolls . Everett ought to get around more . Once the Kahns came up to Stanford to visit Naomi , and Mrs. Kahn later wrote that she considered Everett divine , an honest-to-Christ set piece , whereupon Naomi 's ardor for Everett began to cool . One night toward the end of their junior year she announced that she was driving to Reno the next day to marry a Berkeley graduate student who was active in the Young Communist League ; the Kahns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence . Although Everett never knew what happened to Naomi after that , he noticed the Kahns ' names from time to time among the credits on B comedies , and years later he read in Time that they were up before the Tenney Committee for having participated in the October 1943 Writers ' Congress at UCLA . They were listed as members of several oddly named organizations the function of which Everett did not entirely understand , were later indicted in Washington for contempt of Congress , and Everett reflectedthat Naomi , wherever she was , must have approved at last . Actually Everett had liked Naomi Kahn : he had liked the way her clothes smelled and liked the slightly derisive way she went to bed ; she did it exactly the way she wrote out a midterm or drove a car , with a style and efficiency he had never observed in any of the girls with whom he had grown up , and he loved it . He sometimes thought he even loved her , usually when she had gone to spend the weekend with her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sitting around the house drinking beer or calling up somebody like Annis McMahon . Palo Alto the winter of 1939 seemed full of girls like Annis McMahon , and Everett 's appreciation of Naomi 's singular virtues grew until he actually regretted , for something like fourp169days after she eloped with the Young Communist from Berkeley , that he had not asked her to marry him . Nonetheless , Naomi Kahn had not been , any more than Annis McMahon or for that matter Doris Jeanne Coe had been , someone with whom he could have lived on the ranch . During those four days when he wished he had married Naomi he never once thought of living anywhere with her : they were always driving someplace together , or he was putting her on an airplane , or they were registering at the Fairmont in San Francisco and she had on a black hat with a veil . In the end Naomi had been just like Annis McMahon and a dozen or so girls he had known not as well : something he had tried and abandoned , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with Lily . Even as he imagined himself registering at the Fairmont with Naomi Kahn , Everett knew without thinking that what he would do was live on the ranch with Lily Knight , knew it so remotely that if he had heard , during the years he rarely saw her , that she had married someone else he would have wished her well and gone on thinking about Naomi Kahn at the Fairmont , and only somewhere in the unused part of his mind would he have begun wondering , with an urgency he would not have understood , what he was going to do with the rest of his life . Lily required no commitment : Lily was already there . It had not occurred to him that he could lose her ( had not occurred to him even that he wanted her ) until the week he came home from Stanford and saw her sitting on her father 's terrace in a faded pink dress , the late afternoon sun on her dusty bare feet and a large safety pin in place of a missing screw on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to risk losing her would be to risk losing Martha and Sarah and himself as well , that she alone couldp170retrieve and keep for him the twenty-one years he had alreadyspent . Convinced that he could ill afford to leave her untended for even that one night , he fell asleep finally with his clothes on , a cigarette still burning in the ashtray on his bedroom window sill , and when he woke in the morning he set out immediately to secure for himself the haven of her faded pink dress , her bare feet , the safety pin in her sunglasses . As far as the safety pin went , it remained in her sunglassesuntil the summer she was pregnant with Julie , when he told her one night , irritated partly because she had just uncovered a grocery bill she had lost three months before and partly because she had dragged a sheet down to the sun porch the night before and slept there until ten o'clock but irritated mostly because it had been i o5  --  for three days and she had accused him of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety pin in her sunglassessummed up all her unattractive habits , her sloppinessof mind , her inability to accomplish the routine tasks that could be done with one hand by any of the girls he had known at Stanford . She had gone upstairs without speaking . When he came to bed she had pretended to be asleep , and she had gotten up at seven the next morning to drive into Sacramento . She returned at noon with a new screw in her sunglasses and with , as well , a book called The Managerial Revolution in which she later read the first and last chapters ( she pretended to have read it all but he read it himself and saw that she had not ) , an album of French language records which as far as he knew she never played , eight dollars ' worth of closet bags and boxes , and a large account book in which she wrote down , for two weeks , the exact amounts both she and China Maryp171spent on food and household supplies . The book was in fact labeled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proudly to Martha . The first day 's entry , Martha reported with a degree of admiration , began with an itemizedlist showing the unit prices , the amount saved by buyingin quantity , and a tax breakdown wherever a tax was involved , on twenty-four bottles of beer , twelve cans of mixed carrots and peas , twelve cans of pureed liver , four quarts of milk , two cartons of Lucky Strikes , six tins of smoked oysters , and fifteen cans of Campbell 's Soup ; five consomme , five vegetable-beef , five cream of chicken . Totaled , these items came to $18.53 , and were followed by an entry which read " Etc. - $27 ( about ) . " When Martha asked what the $27 represented , Lily , absorbed in contemplatingthe neatness of her figuring , had shrugged . " You know . A mop handle . Things . " After Lily had abandoned " Food and Household Supplies , " Everett tore the entry from the book , carried it around with him for a couple of weeks and finally put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipping about a no-hit game he had pitched in high school , and a letter from Martha describing the only 4-H meeting she ever attended . The truth was simply that he would not have known what to do with a wife who knew what to do with a book labeled " Food and Household Supplies " : it was not Everett 's idea of a wife 's function . Although he was not sure what his idea of a wife 's function was , he knew that Lily had been closest to fulfilling it when she had been trying least . She simply did not know how . She would concentrateupon the details while the essence eluded her , unable to see that one entry in the Pillsbury Bake-Off did not make a Mrs. America . There as everywhere , Lily failed , even as she tried with pathetic concentration , to apprehend what was expectedp172of her . The most insignificant social encounter was for Lily , as Martha had pointed out at dinner one night this spring , fraught with the apprehension of possible peril . " I mean Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rather not ' or please may I have more coffee , ' " Marthahad added , turning then to Lily . " I do n't know what 's wrong with you but you ca n't . " " Nothing 's wrong with her , " Everett said , although he saw Martha 's point . He had only a week before learned that Lily was allergic to strawberries , which he had seen her eating with apparent delight innumerable times . " I thought your father liked them , " she said , in explanation . " Everett , it 's true . I 'm not being mean to Lily , I 'm only observing something interesting . Somebody holds the door open for Lily in a hardware store , and she thinks she has a very complex situation on her hands . " Martha poured the rest of a bottle of wine into Lily 's glass and sat back , watching Lily . " First Lily says thank you . Then she wonders : did he hear her ? If he did n't , was he thinking how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just thank you ' enough ? If not , what more ? On the other hand maybe thank you ' was too much . Maybe she should have just smiled . Maybe he thought she 'd been forward . In fact maybe she 'd been mistaken in thinking he was holding the door for her at all . Possibly he 'd been holding it for someone behind her , his wife , or an old lady . If that was the case , thanking him made her look a perfect fool , and now she ca n't remember why she came to the hardware store in the first place , and every now and then all day she thinks about how she might have handled it . I mean the crises Lily faces from day to day . " Lily had blown out the candles on the table and **26;3876;TOOLONG Martha : " I do n't think good mannersare ever amiss , " she said . But later , when she wasp173brushing her hair and he was working at the card table he had covered with tax records , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brushing her hair as if she wanted to brush it out . He had put aside the depreciation schedule and picked her up in his arms , the hairbrush still in her hand . Her voice muffled against his shoulder , she explained that she wanted to be like other people , wanted to be able to talk to people . " You 're shy , " he said . " There 's nothing wrong with being shy . " There was , Lily sobbed , something wrong with being shy when you were going on twenty-four years old , and anyway she was not shy , she was simply no good around people and that was that . He had lain on the bed with her and the hairbrush and told her that she was not to talk that way , that she was not other people . She was , he added , turning out the light , his baby . It occurred to Everett later that he had in that commonplaceendearment put his finger on some of Lily 's virtues and certain of her failings.  |p174Lily  came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican pickers and sailors . From San Franciscoto Vallejo she sat next to a sailor who was going to meet his girl in Salt Lake City . She lived with her folks in Salt Lake but Frisco , he explained , was their lucky town . They had met there , in a gin mill on Market Street , four days before he shipped out in 1943 . When she promised to wait had been the A-1 moment in his life , and the second A-1 moment had been a week before on the U.S.S. Chester when he got his first sight in two years of the Golden Gate Bridge . There had been fog in the morning and when the fog broke he saw it there , shining way off in the distance like it was n't attached to anything . The band on the well deck had started in on " California Here I Come " and everybody had belted it out along with the band and it might sound cornball to her but it made him want to sit down and bawl like a baby . Lily began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own , and the sailor said wait a minute , hold your horses , it was n't sad , honey , it was like women crying at weddings . She looked to him like the kind who cried at weddings . It was like that . When the sailor got off at Vallejo to wait for the Salt Lake express Lily wished him good luck and watched him covertly through the window . He was sitting on his duffel bag reading a comic book and eating a Milky Way , and she wanted to get off the bus and give him her garnet ring for his girl , but did not know how to go about it . It was not until the bus had rolled out of the station that Lily remembered that at any rate the garnet ring had been Everett 's grandmother 's and was therefore not in the strictest sense hers to give . From Vallejo to Sacramento she sat next to a woman who was a part-time cashier at a drive-in across the highway from Hotel El Rancho , west of Sacramento . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice place , not large but fixed up cute , above a florist 's shop on Tennessee Street . No doubt Lily knew the florist 's shop . No ? The woman had thought surely she would because they did all the society weddings in Vallejo , it was very well-known . Regretful that she had not pretended to recognize the florist 's name and anxious that the woman not think she had been trying to snub her , Lily hurried to surmount what seemed to her an impasse by asking if the daughter were married . Well , not exactly . It seemed that Sue Ann 's husband , a seaman first class but a bastard from the word go , had got his at Okinawa  --  Sue Ann had been just about set to blow the whistle anyway , as far as that went  --  and Sue Ann was now supporting their six-year-old son , Billy jack , by car-hopping at Stan 's off U.S. 40 . The woman paused , and Lily quickly assured her thatp176she knew Stan 's . ( As it happened , she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights on the radio to Stan 's Private Line , and had even wondered academicallyfrom time to time whether or not she could have made the grade among the leather-jacketed jeunesse doree who gathered nightly at Stan 's to eat Double-Burgers and dedicate songs to one another . ) The woman ignored her . Naturally Sue Ann got asked on a lot of dates  --  she was about Lily 's age but a real doll , built like Rita Hayworth . You could hardly tell them apart except for the hair , and nobody would ever convince her that Rita 's was natural anyway . But do n't get her started on that . So Sue Ann had been playing the field , but now she had a **29;3904;TOOLONG to marry a young fellow who in turn had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to wrap up the Kirby Party franchise for the entire Greater Vallejo area . You know , Kirby Parties . You invite a congenial group to your home and serve a little something , doughnuts and soft drinks , and then the Kirby representative comes and demonstrates the vacuum cleaners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain number to come and you get in a little girl-talk besides . If Lily was n't on to Kirby Parties she ought to take Fred 's number and call him the next time she was in the area , providing his deal went through . Anyway . The only catch was that Fred did n't know about Billy Jack . Or rather he knew about Billy Jack but believed him to be Sue Ann 's little brother . She had warned Sue Ann it was a crazy mad thing to do , trying to pass off Billy Jack as her own mother 's change-of-life baby , but what could you do . Sue Ann had her right to happiness as much as the next one . What did Lily think . As the bus rolled out of the Coast Range and into the heat of the Valley , Lily stopped thinking altogether , lulled by the even rhythm of the telephone poles against fieldp177after dry yellow field , by the regular rise and fall of the woman 's voice , by the grinding and shifting of gears as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns in which she seemed to have spent her life : FairfieldSuisun , Vacaville , Dixon . Although she did not suppose that she had driven through any one of the towns more than on the outside twenty times , they had about them an imprint which to perceive once , especially if that once was on an August afternoon when the streets looked abandonedand the frame buildings as fragile as tinder , was to possess forever . She could close her eyes and tick it off : the Bank of America building , the W.T. Grant store , the Lincoln-Mercury agency ; the lone woman in a shapelessdress and flowered straw hat , sitting on the porch of the hotel until her husband was through in town . Off the main street there would be a few blocks of houses , three-storey houses in need of paint , each fronted by a patch of dry grass , maybe a tricycle overturned on the cracked concrete walk . The blinds would be drawn and there would not be any people , anywhere . The afternoon heat could bleach those towns so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verge of dematerializing ; there was the sense that to close one 's eyes on a Valley town was to risk opening them a moment later on dry fields , the sun bleaching out the last traces of habitation , a flowered straw hat , a neon advertisement which had blinked a moment before from a wall no longer visible : More Yield from Every Acre with Seeds from Northrup-King . It was a great comfort , watching the towns come and go through the tinted window of the Greyhound bus . The heat drained the distinctions from things  --  marriage and divorce and new curtains and overdrafts at the bank , all the same  --  and Lily could not at the moment imagine any preoccupation strong enough to withstand the summer.  |p178At  least any preoccupation of hers ; Sue Ann , now , was anothercase . There would be nothing ambiguous about Sue Ann 's responses , nothing ambivalent about her wants : Sue Ann would have kissed Joe Templeton goodbye with no second thoughts . Sue Ann 's problems , unlike her own , offered the compression , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs at best , and there with her head resting against the bus window she could not think why she had gone to San Francisco or why she had caused a scene with Everett or how she had gotten pregnant in the first place by somebody she did not much like or why , the heart of the matter , she had thought it made any difference . When the bus arrived in Sacramento at six o'clock , however , she emerged as if from a darkened theater into the sudden glare , the sudden presence of people , and the suddenrecollection of why it made any difference . Standing on the loading platform , holding her raincoat and her overnight bag , she could remember just about everything except why she had chosen a four-hour bus ride over two air-conditioned hours in a Southern Pacific club car . For reasons now lost to her , it had seemed in San Francisco the thing to do ; had seemed the way of the Cross . I 've been worried , Joe said when she called him from the bus station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . I just got into town . " She did not want to talk to Joe and did not know why she had called him , except that she had promised to . " I worried , " he repeated . " I could n't sleep . I yelled at Francie . " " You yelled at Francie . " She leaned against the wall ofp179the telephone booth and tried to open the glass door with her foot , succeeding only in catching her heel between the door and the jamb . " How are you ? " " I 'm all right . " Working her foot free , she let the shoe drop . " I 'm fine . " " You sound pretty good . " " How did you expect me to sound ? " In the prolonged silence which followed she reached to retrieve her shoe and saw that she had snagged her stocking on the lock of her overnight case . " Damn it . " She jammed her foot into her shoe and brushed her damp hair from her face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . I was just putting my shoe on . " " Putting your shoe on ? Why did you have your shoes off ? " " No reason , Joe , no reason . I 'm just down here in the Greyhound bus station barefoot , see . " " Cut it out . " " I 'm sorry . " After a silence Joe said tentatively : " You saw the doc-tor ? " " Yes . " " How did it go ? " " It was fine . Everything was just fine . " " I told you it would be . " She did not say anything . " He did n't charge you any more , did he ? " " No . It went all right . " " I told you it would . He did n't want any more money ? " " No , I said . " She was irritated by his preoccupation withthe money ; it had been her five hundred dollars in the firstplace . To get the cash she had sold ten shares of an oilp180stock her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not like to be reminded of it . Although she had not thought of it before , there was something about Joe 's inability to put his hands on five hundred dollars without Francie 's knowing about it which summed up all his rather aggressive weaknesses . " I would have cut off my right arm if I could have gone down there for you . " " Now you cut it out , " she said , and was immediately touched with remorse : if he was dishonest so was she . If she were honest she would not even be talking to him on the telephone . ' There was nothing you could do , " she added , ashamed . " It 's been pretty bad . You know how bad I felt aboutiit . " He paused . " Maybe I could see you tomorrow . " " No , " she said rapidly . " I mean I ca n't . I have to rest . " " I guess you better . " He sounded relieved . " I justthought you 'd want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I do n't want to talk to someone . I do n't want to talk to anyone . " She clicked off the connection with her finger and dropped the receiver in her lap . Her silk suit was damp with perspiration and stained not only with dust but tea , spilled at the counter in the San Francisco bus station . She should have let the waitress sponge it off but her bus had already been called and she had not wanted to run ; she had been afraid that if she moved too quickly the bleedingwould begin again . If she had not wanted to talk to Joe , she certainly did not want to talk to Everett . Nonetheless , she had to get home and felt incapable of explaining to anyone else what she was doing with her suitcase in the Greyhound bus station . She had meant to take the river bus out to the ranch , but the drivers had gone on strike . If it was not onep181thing it was another . Fumbling in her bag for a cigarette , she dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . When her mother answered she felt tears rising , hung up without saying anything , and smoked the cigarette down to her fingers . I would have cut off my right arm , she thought viciously . He knew what he could cut off . She blew her nose , snapped her bag shut , and called the ranch . Everett answered on the first ring . " Sweet Jesus , Lily . You all right ? " " I 'm fine . " " Where the hell are you ? " She hesitated . Where was she . It was the giveaway , the proof of how she felt , the evidence that she would never be the kind who could carry things off . " At the Greyhound bus station , " she said at last . " You fool , " he said softly . " You goddamn little ass . " She drank some warm Coca-Cola in a sticky paper cup and went outside the station to wait for Everett . At sixthirtyeverything seemed still : the traffic had already thinned out and the thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . In front of the loadingplatform a sailor was trying to pick up two girls ; both the girls wore white peasant blouses , pulled down off their shoulders , and one had her hair tied up in a magenta scarf . When the sailor , teasing , pulled off the scarf , Lily saw that the girl 's head was covered with pin curls . Snatchingthe scarf back , the girl struck an exaggerated pose with it , and they all laughed . They seemed to be having a very good time and it tired Lily to think that she was probably no older than they were . Depressed , she turned her attention across the street top182a parking lot where a few men , apparently late from their offices and obviously all acquainted , were picking up their cars . She reflected sadly that they would no doubt arrive home to find their well-behaved sun-tanned wives getting out of their swimming suits and dressed for dinner . It was too hot a night to cook ; all over town those loving summerwives were brushing the chlorine out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner . The would be at the country club tonight , wearing their bright clean linen dresses loosely , as if they were unaccustomed to wearing clothes at all . They would talk about their diets and their children and their golf scores , display their even dispositionsand their gold charm bracelets , and presently they would go home to take off the bright clean linen dresses , to lie on hot sheets and wait patiently for the day to begin again . You would never catch one of them standing around the Greyhound bus station in a tea-stained wrinkled silk suit not wanting to see her husband . You would never even catch one of them standing around anywhere in a teastainedwrinkled silk suit . There was the kind of wife Everett should have , and look what he had instead . Martha had said it all : Lily had no right to her brother . Everett , like Sue Ann , had his right to happiness as much as the next one . It was almost seven-thirty before Everett arrived . Unshavenand wearing a dirty khaki shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear bumper of a parked Chevrolet , and took Lily 's arm . She had not at first seen him , and smiled tentatively when he touched her . He picked up her suitcase , helped her around the Chevrolet , and opened the station-wagon door without speaking . Before they were home she had fallen asleep , dry-eyed for a change , her head in the way of the gear shift.  |p183Later  he put her to bed , opened the shutters which had been closed all day against the heat , and wiped her face with a washcloth soaked in witch hazel . " Did you get the hops finished ? " she whispered , openingher eyes . " Yes , " he said . " Everything 's fine . Go to sleep . " " Listen . " She took the washcloth from him and laid it across her eyes . " I love you . " He looked at her for a long time . " Stop feeling sorry for yourself , " he said finally . She took the washcloth from her eyes and threw her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I love you . I know you and you know me and nobody else does . Everett please baby love me . " She clung to him while he kissed her hair , and when he moved to take her arms from his neck she tighened her hold . " Lie here with me , " she whispered . " Lie here with me until it 's all dark . " " Later . " He stood up . " Go to sleep now , baby . " He sat with Knight for half an hour on the third floor , from where they could see the fireworks in town , for that day happened also to be the opening of the State Fair . There would be fireworks every night for twelve days , great slow bursts of white and pink and green , barely visible from the ranch . Long before the last distant sparks had showered out and drifted down , Knight fell asleep in Everett 's arms , and he carried him downstairs without waking him and put him to bed in his playsuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . The house was quiet : Julie was at her grandmother 's ; Martha had gone to the Fair with Ryder Channing . Insisting that Lily and Everett must come with them , they had waited an hour to see if Lily might arrive ;  |p184Everett  had gotten rid of them only by saying that the four of them would go to the Fair over the weekend . After they had gone Everett had sat in the kitchen with a bottle of beer and an article Channing had brought him about what was described as a pioneer shopping center in Kansas City . The kitchen chairs were uncomfortable and Everett had found it increasingly difficult to concentrate on why some developers preferred shopping centers with mall layouts to shopping centers with cluster layouts , whatever a cluster layout was ; the kitchen , however , was the only place in the house where he did not feel oppressed by the presence of telephones . Although he knew that there were only two telephones in the house and five on the entire ranch , the house had seemed , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to service a handbook operation . Now he sat down again in the kitchen and tried to finish the article Channing had given him , but after three or four more paragraphs abandoned it . For fifteen minutes he sat reading the labels on the beer bottle he had left on the table when Lily called , and finally he went outside and set sprinklers to run all night on the south lawn , an extravagancejustified only by the possibility that it would cool Lily 's and the children 's room some . He thought automaticallynow of Lily 's room , and when he went to sleep at eleven o'clock it was , for the first time of many , in his father 's bed . Although during the night he thought he woke and heard voices in the driveway , first Channing 's , shut up you 're almost shouting , and then Martha 's , you think she 's so interesting-looking maybe you could knock her up yourself the next time , by morning it seemed easier to believe that he had only dreamed it.  |p185There  was nothing wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred from his habit , when he was at any house within fifty miles of San Francisco , of asking his hostess if she had at hand a copy of the 1948 San Francisco Social Register because he wanted to look up a new telephone number . Actually , Martha amended , Ryder took her calling in San Francisco so infrequently that she had only once witnessedhim asking for the 1948 Social Register to look up a telephone number , but she was certain that it had been no improvisation of the moment . It was of a piece with his routinely asking people from Cleveland where they lived in Shaker Heights . " That 's not fair of me , " Martha added then with the instantcontrition which tended , for a while quite successfully , to obscure the hostile edge on her voice ; her standard conversational technique was that of a trial lawyer whop186pursues a tendentious line of questioning and then allows it stricken from the record . " I mean that 's perfectly true about Ryder and the Social Register but it 's not fair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes around talking about big deals that never go through and all but that does n't mean Ryder 's a phony . Ryder just wants things . That 's not so bad , to want things . Is it . " " Not at all , " Lily said , virtuously knotting a thread in a dress she was making by hand for Julie 's first day at school . The dress was an economy measure : Everett had said that their 1949 taxes would be double this year 's  --  both the riverfront and the Cosumnes ranches had been reassessed for the first time since the war  --  and Lily had resolved , without mentioning it to Everett , to save money . She had begun by saving the six or seven dollars she would normally have paid for Julie 's dress , instead buying four dollars ' worth of imported lawn and a sixty-cent pattern . After three weeks of intermittent work , the lawn was not only grimy from her fingers but spotted here and there with blood from her pricked fingers ; it should , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and good hats , her mother often told her , were no extravagance . Impressed with the fruit of her own economy , Lily added : " Wanting things and working to get them . It 's the basis of the American way . " " Balls . You are n't even listening to me . " " Really , Martha . " Although Lily had never known exactlywhat the word meant , it did not sound conversational to her . She had for that matter first heard it from Martha , the afternoon Mr. McClellan died in Sutter Hospital . BecauseMartha was having a cigarette with one of the doctors , Lily had been alone in the room , holding Mr. McClellan 's hand , when he woke from the coma . " You'rep187a good girl , Miss Lily Knight , " he said , opening his eyes and squeezing her hand weakly . " You 're sickly-looking but you 're a good girl . " " Balls , " Martha said from the doorway , seeing that her father 's eyes were again closed and his hand fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand out to shield Mr. McClellan from Martha 's voice , but ten minutes later he was dead and possibly he had heard neither Martha 's invective nor , a minute later , her sobbing . " I 'm sorry , " Martha said now . " It 's only that you were at it again . " " At what again ? " " You know . " Martha paused . " Your dress is coming along nicely . That blue should be very good on Julie . " Lily smiled , and held the dress up for Martha 's further approval . " If only there were n't that gap between her teeth . " Lily laid the dress aside and began threading a needle . Martha had told Julie that unless her teeth were straightenedimmediately she would grow up to be a very unattractivelittle girl . For several days Julie had been inconsolable , repeatedly climbing up on the washbasin to inspect her teeth in the bathroom mirror . " I told you before , her second teeth are n't even in . " Lily finished threading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martha shrugged , her interest in orthodontia apparently ebbing . " Ryder just wants things , " she repeated reflectively . " That 's exactly the thing about Ryder . " " What does Ryder want now . " Martha looked at her a long while . " This is what they call a mo-bile situation , see , Lily . Ryder is what they call up-ward mo-bile . Or on-the-make . Did n't you ever takep188any courses ? Did n't you ever read any books by Lloyd Warner ? " " There 's  --  " Lily stopped . She had been about to say that there was nothing wrong in wanting to get ahead . She did not know what it was about Martha that inflexibly brought out in her diction the best of both Mr. McClellan and her mother . " There 's what ? " Martha demanded . " Nothing . " " ' There 's nothing wrong in wanting to get ahead , ' " Martha mimicked . " I know you . Well there 's not . But you do n't understand about Ryder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't get all upset . " " Well he ca n't use me . " Martha paused . " I do n't want anything from him . That 's the reason he ca n't use me . " " Martha , " Lily repeated . " I do n't want his jobs , I do n't want his favors , I do n't want anything about him . " What Martha did not want from Ryder Channing that morning was the job he had gotten her three weeks before on a Sacramento television station . It was the fourth or fifth such job for which he had arranged an interview ; it was not only the first one Martha had taken but the first one , as far as Lily knew , for which she had even shown up for the initial appointment . The idea behind this particularjob had been that Martha , after a month of answering letters from viewers and doing other small jobs around the station , would eventually work into doing both the morninginterview program and the commercials during the afternoon movie , a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the manager 's wife , now pregnant.  |p189It  was , Ryder had declared , an unbeatable opportunity to get in on the ground floor of an industry with nowhere to go but up , and he had installed a borrowed television set on the sun porch so that Martha could observe the interview and commercial techniques developed by the manager 's wife , Maribeth Sidell . Martha had only to consider that Maribeth Sidell was a household word the length and breadth of the Sacramento Valley to realize , he pointed out , the future in the job . Together , Lily and Martha had watched several of MaribethSidell 's programs , including one on which she interviewed , simultaneously , a retired disk jockey , Miss Sacramento , and two Japanese businessmen in the United States to arrange a trade fair . When the conversation turned to how Sacramento compared to Yokohama , Martha switched off the set and declared that she was a natural for the job . After avidly testing some of the products Maribeth advertised , in order to get what she called " fresh insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reported at dinner that he had asked her to call him " Buzz , " had taken her to the Sacramento Hotel bar , and after two Manhattans ( for him ) and two sherries ( for her ) had announced that although she was no Jinx Falkenburg she had a lot of class and for his money ( $75 a week ) the ball was hers to run with . " I knew the sherry would get him , " Martha added enthusiastically . " The cornball . " Although Lily never learned exactly where the ball had been dropped , Martha had worked only one full week and three days of last week . On the fourth day she had left the house as usual at seven-thirty , but by eleven , when Sidell called the ranch , she had not yet arrived at work . Toward five o'clock she walked into the kitchen through the back door , runs in both her stockings and thistles caught along the hem of her white linen dress . " I was sick , "  |p190she  explained shortly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched a stretch of rapids in the Feather for a while . " " Sidell called , " Lily said . " So did Ryder . " " Did he . " Martha turned on the faucet in the sink and splashed water on her face and arms . " There was a dead rattlesnake caught in a backwater , " she said finally , reaching for a paper towel . " Bloated . " When Ryder Channing called again at seven o'clock Martha at first said to tell him she was out , then , as Lily hesitated , put down her drink , reached across the table for a cigarette from Lily 's bag , and took the telephone from her . " That 's right , I did n't , " she said . " I did n't feel good . " Holding the receiver with her shoulder she lit the cigarette and made a face at Julie , who was illuminating with red and blue crayons a Standard Oil brochure addressed to Everett . " I just did n't call , that 's all . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she added after a pause . " It 's part of your egocentricity that you think everything I do is for the express purpose of getting on your nerves . I did n't go in and I did n't call and that 's all there is to it . It has n't got anything to do with you . " She paused , turning her face to the wall . " Ryder , I was scared . I do n't know why , I was just scared . " " All right , " she said finally . " I never asked you to get me any jobs . I never asked you for anything but a little understanding and it 's perfectly apparent to me that you are n't capable of giving anybody anything . All you want to do is use people . " She put out her cigarette , and took Julie 's hand , holding it very tightly . Julie looked at Lily and Lily shook her head . " I 'm sure I do n't know what advantagethere could possibly be for you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes through your mind . I onlyp191know there was an advantage or you would n't have pushed me into it . You are forever pushing me and using me and I 'm through . " " Through , " she repeated . " Do n't you get that way with me , Ryder Channing . I 've heard that one before . I wo n't miss anything about you and most of all , first on the list of things I will not miss , most of all I will not miss that . " She hung up , picked up her drink , and walked outside . Although no one mentioned it at dinner , Martha explainedlater to Everett that the job had been all right the first week but had become too difficult . The telephones distracted her and there was an enormous clock with a second hand that never stopped . Sidell insisted that letters from viewers be answered the day they came in , and frequentlyshe did not know the answers to the questions raised . The week before she had stopped Sidell in the hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the channel did not carry the program with Kukla , Fran , and 011ie . Sidell had looked at her for a long time and asked her if she had ever heard of networks and network affiliates . She had tried to tell him that of course she had  --  she had simply not thought of an answer so obvious  --  but he walked away and naturally she had not wanted to ask him any more questions . Instead she had begun putting difficultqueries aside in a drawer of her desk , meaning to find out later how to answer them , but the days had gone by and the letters had not been answered and now Sidell would discover them and she simply could not go back . It would be all right if she could take the letters off somewhere and answer them by herself but there was no place in the office where you could get away from those clocks . She knew clocks were n't supposed to stop , do n't be silly . She knew they needed a clock . But she could not work withp192it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way she could not seem to take her eyes off it , and because it made no noise she found herself making the noise for it in her mind . Everett , who had thought the job a good idea because Martha 's days did not seem to him generally constructive , suggested that possibly Martha would like to take a trip . Martha thought not . For the rest of that week Martha had refused to answer the telephone , to look at her mail , or to leave the ranch , even for a wedding down the river in which she was to have been a bridesmaid . She was quite certain , she explained to Everett and Lily , that the four hundred guests , two flower girls , and seven remaining bridesmaids could sufficiently nerve Molly Bee to lose her cherry without any additional help from her . Everett walked out of the house then , neither speaking to Martha nor getting dressed for the wedding , and finally Lily had gone alone , late , to Molly Bee 's reception , where she tried to apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an hour and fifteen minutes , was warned by her mother that she would end up with a well-deserved headache , and kissed two of the ushers , one of whom , Molly Bee 's cousin from Tulare , insisted that she was in no condition to drive and that he would drive her home himself , later . That he would be returning the next day to Tulare lent him , when she was kissing him in the car , an air of infinite promise : she could make him want her and then never see him again , all of the possibilities still intact , neither his deficienciesnor her own ever revealed . You make me feel good , she whispered , and meant it . When she arrived at the ranch not long after two A.M.p193Everett was sitting in the chair by their bedroom window , drinking a beer and looking at an old copy of Life . Althoughshe tried to tell him who had been at Molly Bee 's wedding he did not seem interested , and after he had picked up the pink silk dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indelible wrinkles in the skirt and then at her and had dropped the dress on the floor and gone downstairs , she lay on the bedspread in her slip and turned out the lights : she had gone and lost him again and not for any reason , not for any good reason at all . After a while , because she had a headache from the champagne and from the gin she had been drinking in the car with Molly Bee 's cousin and because she thought Everett would . have to come if she told him she was sick , she went to the landing and called him . " Go back to sleep , " he said withoutmoving . On the following Monday a letter had arrived for Marthafrom the television station , but Martha shoved it unopenedinto the back of a drawer where Lily found it after her death . It contained only a note from Sidell expressingconcern for her illness and a check for the eight days she had worked.  |p194At  ten-thirty on the morning of December 18 , 1948 , while she was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not already worked the crossword puzzle , Martha saw in the social pages of the San Francisco Chronicle the announcement of Ryder Channing 's engagement to a Miss Nancy Dupree of Piedmont . After tearing the notice out of the Chronicle and securing it in the pocket of her jumper , Martha wrapped with her calling card  --  Miss Martha CurrierMcClellan , McClellan 's Landing , let Miss Nancy Dupreefigure out who it was  --  a silver dish which Channing had once admired . It was a small dish which had been her mother 's , made to Mildred McClellan 's order at Shreve 's in San Francisco and marked M.C.McC . In a smaller box she placed another calling card , with her key to Channing 's apartment in Sacramento Scotch-taped over her name . She had both packages ready to mail by early afternoon , driving in to the main post office in Sacramento and stop/ping first at the library to look up the Piedmont address in an Oakland telephone book . In the library she located as well several photographs of Nancy Dupree in a Universityof California yearbook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senior Class Council , she had one year been chosen not only Soph Doll but Sweetheart of Sigma Chi Attendant . Her major was listed as General Curriculum . She appeared to be somewhat less blond than Martha , with prettier features , and as Martha studied first one and then another picture she remembered that she had met the girl at a party in Piedmont to which Ryder had taken her . She had simply not remembered her name . It had been one of those parties at which she drank too much and became depressed , a party at which she had known none of the people Channing seemed to know ; as she once explained to Everett , Ryder 's only real vocation was for remembering and being remembered by all the people he went out of his way to meet . At some point during the evening she had locked herself in the bathroom and stared at her reflection in the mirror for a long time and not looked like herself ( Your name is Martha McClellan , she said again and again to the mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Martha McClellan she had wanted to be ) , and when she came downstairs again she had told two strangers , a pretty girl and her husband who had made a perfunctory attempt to include her in a controversy over whether or not Ernie Heckscher had played for the hostess 's debut , that she was sick . " Come sit down a minute , " the pretty girl said , looking at Martha and then at her husband , but then Martha saw Ryder , standing by the piano singing " As Time Goes By " with his arm around a girl in Bermuda shorts and a Liberty lawn blouse , and she ran into the bedroom , pulled her sweater from beneath a pile of navy-blue and red and forest-green blazers , and walkedp196out of the house . Go ahead , she screamed at Ryder when he followed her out to the car . You go on back in there and play whatever games you want to play . Just do n't think I do n't see . She could not now remember what she thought she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the girl at the piano singing " As Time Goes By , " the girl in the Liberty lawn blouse who had earlier asked Ryder if she could count on him for a Scotch foursomeSunday at Claremont Country Club , had been Nancy Dupree . Do n't think I do n't know , Martha had screamed there in the driveway as Ryder tried to take the car keys from her . Although she had not screamed loudly , he shoved her into the car and slapped her . Her first thought had been that it was Everett 's car and Ryder had no right to slap her in Everett 's car , but then she had remembered that Everett surely cared as little for her as Ryder did , and all during the two-hour drive to Sacramento she sat rigid against the door , trying to think how to hurt them both . What she had done finally was spend the night in Ryder 's apartment , an injury to Everett which , because he had assumed she was staying all night in Piedmont anyway , escaped him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're Ryder 's best girl in the Valley , " the girl had said , taking Martha 's hand and smiling up at Ryder , " I 've heard so much about you " ) , the more she resented Ryder now , and it was with a palpable knot of hatred in her stomach that she returned the yearbook to the librarian , crossed the street to the post office , and waited in line ten minutes to see that the clerk gave immediate attention to the key for Ryder , the silver dish for Nancy Dupree . Rid of the boxes , she started back across the Plaza to the car , but because she felt both dizzy and a little silly , she stopped and sat on the edge of the fountain long enough top197smoke two cigarettes and to chew , since an old man lay passed out at the foot of the water fountain , one of the phenobarbitaltablets the doctor had told her to take three times a day . There were lighted Christmas wreaths strung across J Street and as the phenobarbital began to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that her father were alive , that Sarah could come home for Christmas . There was something about Christmas as managed by Lily that was not quite Christmas , although everyone tried very hard to pretend it was and although Edith Knight always came to stay on the ranch for a few days , decorating everything in sight , hanging stockings for Knight and Julie , and helping China Mary make quantities of eggnog which no one ever dropped by to drink . A few minutes after she got back to the ranch , Ryder called her from a bar . She knew he was in a bar because she could hear the juke box . Well , what a surprise . She wanted to offer him all her congratulations . Oh , he said . He had called to see if she was home . He had planned to drive out and tell her himself . He had not thought of her seeing the San Francisco papers . No , of course he would not have thought of her seeing the San Francisco papers . He had been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times during the past four and a half years , and no one could have expected him to notice that they got the San Francisco papers . It was n't a bit nice to think about how life went on  --  papers got delivered , papers got read , that kind of think when one was n't counting on it , was it . But never mind . It was all very , very nice and she had only an hour before sent off her blessings to that most fortunate girl , Miss Nancy Dupree . Who was , she believed , the same Miss Nancy Dupree known to her friends in the East Bay Junior Assistancep198League as " Bugsy " ? Just so . Nicknames . Cute as a bug 's ear . You knew that any girl who 'd call herself Bugsy had a sense of fun . There was one little thing . She did think , could n't help thinking , that since his plans must have been more or less settled last night , he might have told her his surprise then . Of course they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering where she had put the razor blades she had brought the day before , typing out his application for an extension on his personal loan at the Wells Fargo . There had been scarcely a minute for surprises , had there . Or possibly he had not known then . Possiblyhe and Bugsy had just decided late last night on the long-distance telephone and Bugsy had thrown on her forest-green blazer and rushed the news right over to the Chronicle . What a stroke of luck , deciding in time for the Valley Edition . He did not know why he had called her at all . He should have known that she would only behave as stupidly as she was behaving now . Count on her to act like a gauche , bitchy little girl . Oh . So he was drinking . She supposed he must be fairly proud of himself . She knew he was drinking or he would not have had the courage to call her in the first place . Drinking or not , his character was nothing to write home about . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as for that talent of which he was so proud , she could walk out the door and get it better from the first picker she came across . Without any of the games . She could go to hell . But Jesus Christ , baby . Anybody who 'd call herself Bugsy . Although she had torn the announcement from the paper expressly so that Everett and Lily would not see it ,  |p199they  would know by sundown anyway . Everyone on the river got the San Francisco papers . She had wanted them not to know because she did not want Ryder 's name taken in vain . In the strictest sense , which was the sense Martha prided herself upon , Ryder was not in the least in the wrong . Ryder was simply the way he was , and she had known all along how he was . To have persisted , knowing that , was to have taken the responsibility upon herself . I 'm quite old enough and more than smart enough to know what I 'm doing , she had told Everett three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told even her father although not in so many words . She had known it so thoroughly that for the past two years she had not even thought of marryingRyder , except as a dark contract they could undertake if all else failed , an unattended ritual during which both would avert their eyes , a civil ceremony incorporating the more lurid aspects of a black mass . But despite what she knew , she had , every time he smiled and put his hand on her neck and said whose girl , smiled back . Your girl . To avoid Lily and Everett , she sat in her room for the rest of the afternoon , knitting and trying to call up a catalogueof Ryder 's virtues against the probability that someonewould question his possession of any . Ryder loved small children , at least if they were clean and attractive . He delighted in giving people presents . He had once driven straight through from Los Angeles in order to be at the ranch in time for her birthday . Occasionally when he thought she was asleep he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he rarely did either when he thought she was awake . ( That , however , was not a widely employable defense , and neither was the fact that he had once at a party knocked out a drunk , someone they did not know , for pointing at Lily and saying There goes the easiest lay in the room , I can always spot them , something scared in their eyes . As she had explained to Ryder , she hadp200appreciated it for Everett 's sake . ) He always asked her if his tie looked all right with his jacket , expressed concern about the correct length for her skirts , and had once gotten up at four o'clock in the morning and met every plane into Sacramento until noon on the off chance that she might be flying home from Carrnel that morning . Again in the strictest sense , she had thought of nothing which could be accurately described as a virtue , but by six o'clock she had thought of so many things that had at one time or another pleased or amused her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had regularly screamed at him to get away from her and stay away from her , cried for the loss of Ryder Channing . When she saw the candles lighted in the dining room , she knew that Lily had heard . Lily would have heard and lighted the candles and brought up a bottle of wine and told China Mary to find some artichokes because Martha liked them . Lily and her mother were both great little candle lighters . The river could be in flood , the barn could be on fire , an escaped convict could be holding them hostage : you 'd find Lily and Edith Knight in the dining room , lighting the candles and chatting about silver patterns , asking the convict if he would mind a dry white instead of a red with the roast . It was so pronounced an act that Lily 's every gesture toward domestic gaiety or grace aroused the suspicion that disaster was at hand . Avoiding Lily 's eyes , she let Lily and Everett know , before the artichokes were on the table , that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , but she could not be more pleased . Really . It was exactly what Ryder needed . Of course she had met her . She had met her a year ago , and had hoped then that Ryder would marryp201her . Lily would have to meet her . They would ask Ryder to bring her out . Lily thought , although she was not certain , that she had known the girl 's older sister the year she was at Berkeley . Sally Dupree . A Kappa , lived in Piedmont off Mountain , near that circle . Would that be the family , she wondered . That would be the family . Money , then . Construction money , Everett believed . Wartime . It was all mixed up in his mind with Henry Kaiser . It had , Lily corrected him , nothing to do with Henry Kaiser . It was perhaps the same kind of thing , but not connectedin any way . No ships . And although she was perfectlyaware that Dupree Development Inc. had gotten big during and since the war , the Duprees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally in 1940 . Ships or no , Martha supposed that Nancy Dupree had probably come out at the Fairmont in a white dress ordered from Elizabeth Arden . Lily was not sure . Those construction people were a little different , particularly if they lived in the East Bay . It was not as if her name were Crocker or Spreckels or something like that . No , Martha agreed , it was not . It certainly was not as if her name were Crocker or Spreckels or something like that . What a revelation , Lily 's sudden grasp on the San Francisco social scene . Was it possible that Lily had at hand a copy of the 1948 San Francisco Social Register ? Never mind about that , Lily said . Just never mind . Anyway . Sally Dupree , the sister , had been much the same type as that girl of Everett 's who played tennis . Alice whatever her name was . Annis , Everett said . Annis McMahon . She had known it was something like Alice.  |p202Perha|ps  , Everett suggested , Martha would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everett could think of nothing else to do with her , he urged her to take a trip . There was nothing like a trip . She could , Everett pressed , visit Sarah in Philadelphia . Sarah could take her to New York and she could buy some new clothes , see some plays . Philadelphia was not universally considered , or so Martha had heard , the ideal winter vacation spot . She had not heard of the smart San Francisco set  --  Crocker , Spreckels , names like that  --  wintering there in years . Perhaps the Islands , Lily improvised . There were all kinds of people Martha knew in Honolulu right now and she could have a marvelous time . As a matter of fact she might plan to take the Lurline over with Francie Templetonin January . It was all , Martha said , Del Paso Heights to her . It was a joke , Lily explained to Everett . It was something funny his father had once said . Speaking of funny things people said , Martha wanted to tell them something funny Nancy Dupree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in Piedmont . Nancy ( who was , Lily and Everett should know , called " Bugsy , " that 's right , Bugsy Dupree ) had told her that the only ships to take in the Pacific were the American President ships , because they were jammed with fascinating people  --  Japanese engineers , people like that . There you were , Lily declared . She was exactly like her sister and they were both exactly like that Alice McMahon . Annis . Annis McMahon . Well , whatever . She would have said something like that . She would have told you about the fascinating Japanese engineers you met on the American President ships.  |p203What  was wrong with Japanese engineers , Everett wanted to know . If you were on a ship going to Japan you presumably liked Japanese people in the first place . Everett was , Lily said , missing the point altogether . There was nothing wrong with Japanese engineers . It was simply that a certain kind of girl would say that . Sally Dupree . That tennis player . Everett did not recall that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . And if she was not mistaken Martha had too . Had n't Martha met Annis McMahon ? Martha did not know . Possibly she had . She did not raise her eyes from her own hand on the table , as if she could scarcely summon up enough interest to answer at all . After Lily had left the table to put Knight and Julie to bed , Martha lit a cigarette from the candles and then blew them out one by one . " I wish we had some brandy . " " We drank two bottles of wine between us . " " That 's not the same thing , Everett . Get with it . " " You drink too much . " " Now Everett . Sometimes I drink too much . Sometimes you drink too much . But neither of us quote unquote drinks too much . Francie Templeton is practically the only person you know who categorically drinks too much . " " You are tight right now . " " All right , " Martha said without interest , scraping candle wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did like Channing , " Everett said suddenly . " I never did think you should be messing around with him . "  | " Everett . Ryder Channing has been and is now my best friend . " She pushed back her chair and stood up . " Now you sing some Christmas carols with me . " Everett stood behind her at the piano , singing an occasionalphrase of " 0 Little Town of Bethlehem " as she picked out the notes with her right hand . Still playing , she said abruptly : " Remember before Sarah got married when we used to go to Carmel at Christmastime ? " " Yes , " he said . " I remember . " " You remember we 'd go to the graveyard first and put a holly wreath on Mother 's grave , then drive on down to Carmel ? " " I remember , " he repeated . " Why ? " " It was nice then , that 's all . " Over and over Martha played the same phrase : Above thy deep and dreamless sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on the lights , the blaze from the fireplaceand the colored lights on the Christmas tree flickered all around the room . " I always think about how nice it was at Christmas , that 's all . " She stopped playing . " I always thought it was you and me together , against Sarah and Daddy . Because they rememberedMother and you really did n't . I always figured they thought she would n't have died if it had n't been for me . " " You should n't have thought that , " Everett said absently , letting his hand drop to her hair . " But anyway I did . And we always took that same house out on the point ? " " It was Aunt Grace 's house . " " I thought it was ours . I looked for it when I was down last year but I could n't find it . And you always carried me upstairs to bed ? "  | " I 'd forgotten . " " But you did . " As she turned to face him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did . " " I remember now , baby . " She turned back to the keyboardand began again to pick out notes . How still we see thee lie . " What about it ? " he said . " Nothing about it . " She twisted her shoulder away from his hand . " This piano needs tuning . " Because Everett told her that she should see some people and buy some new clothes , she did . She went to parties every night between Christmas and New Year 's , and on the first business day of 1949 she went to San Francisco and charged $758.90 to her and Lily 's account at Magnin 's . Because she could not see that dressing like what the elevator advertisements called a Marima Shop Young Fashionablehad gotten her very far in the past , she went not to the sixth floor , where she and Lily normally shopped , but to the third , where nothing was on racks and all the labels were oversized , heavy enough to stand alone , and embroidered with such intrinsically expensive words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told the saleswoman , and she came home that night with a red coat , a white chiffon dinner dress , two black lace slips , and a white silk dress appliqued with silk butterflies the exact pale color of her hair . The dress with the butterflies cost $250 and was expressly to wear on the twenty-second of January at Nancy Dupree 's wedding . Although Everett thought $250 a great deal to pay for a little dress with some butterflies thrown on it , it was all , he agreed , way out , and on the day of the wedding , when she put on the dress for the first time , he assured her that she had never looked prettier . Because Lily and the children had virus andp206Everett did not want to leave them , Martha drove down alone to the wedding , rehearsing out loud , in the car , things she could say . Ryder 's so lucky . She looks beautiful . I 've never been busier . By the time she reached Piedmont , however , she could remember none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel and as she drove past the church she did not see how she could possibly go in . Anyway she would be late by the time she found a parking place , and anyway no one ever noticed who was at the church . She would drive around and pull herself together and by the time she got to the reception it would be all right . Although she began to feel better immediately , her hands began shaking again as she drove to the reception , and she sat in the Claremont Country Club parking lot for ten minutes , putting on lipstick and then blotting it off , trying to brush back a strand of hair which fell forward over her face , and smoking one cigarette after another . It was all right , however , once she went inside . Everyone said how marvelous she looked , and she kissed Ryder on the cheek and told him she already loved both his bride and his sister ( whom she had just met and been delighted to find rather tackily dressed ) ; she drank a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good dress to dance in because the butterflies appeared to move  --  and when she left it was with a man who seemed to be about forty and who had a suite at the Claremont Hotel . She stayed there until 4 A.M. , when she woke up and told him that the way he looked disgusted her , the way he talked disgusted her , and she disgusted herself , she was no better than Lily . Who was Lily , he wanted to know ; she 's my sister , Martha said , and you are n't good enough to say her name . I 've never been busier , she told them at the wedding , and in fact she had not been . Although neither she nor Lilyp207had ever joined the Junior League , Martha now became a provisional member , spent every evening and most afternoonsin town , and at the end of February calculated that she had received proposals of marriage from two of the boys with whom she had grown up and had gone to bed with three , counting one who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dupree 's wedding receptionwhose last name she did not remember . ( She believedhe had something to do with shopping centers , but it was all mixed up in her mind , as in Everett 's , with Henry Kaiser . ) Since everyone else was at the moment married that just about cleaned the situation up , and when she tallied up their assets and their liabilities , the balance was , as she had hoped it would be , nada . All the connections had been broken , all the bridges burned miles back in the country she had crossed to achieve this insular victory . Even Ryder was included in her pervasivecontempt : he could no longer touch her . There , the battle had turned . All the others had been civilian casualties , lost somewhere beyond the front lines : Channing was her dam on the Ruhr , her Guadalcanal , her Stalingrad . Thinking herself victorious , she despised all the vulnerable : all those who liked or disliked , wanted or did not want , damaged themselves with loving and hating and migraineheadaches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banner she planted read Noli Me Tangere.  |p208It  was a season of promise for anyone with a little land or a little money or even nothing more than an eye on the main chance ; it was a season of promise for Ryder Channing , back in town with his bride after a three-week honeymoon in Acapulco ; and it should be , Martha thought some nights as she was going to sleep , a season of promise for her . The mornings were more difficult : some mornings she did not want to get up at all . Some mornings she could get up only if she had already scheduled every minute of the day , which she learned immediately to do . She went everywhere , met everyone . She met builders , promoters , people looking for factory sites and talking about a deep-water channel and lobbying for federal dams ; people neither Everett nor Lily would have known existed had she not told them . She went to large parties at new country clubs , went to small parties at new apartment houses , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or another ofp209the boys she knew who were going into the real-estate business . Although Lily and Everett claimed to see no distinctionsamong the miles of pastel stucco houses , Martha knew better . It was , she explained , a matter of detail . Some builders used panels of redwood siding ; others , an imitationfieldstone veneer around each door . In one tract ( " ExecutiveLiving on Low F.H.A. " ) each back yard included a small kidney-shaped swimming pool , a cabana , and a neatly framed placard listing " Pool Rules " ; most subdivisions , however , had only Community Pools , sometimes known as Swimming Clubs , and in any case surrounded by Cyclone fencing . Robles de la Sierra , a tract north of town , afforded prospective buyers " a setting with the romance of An Old Spanish Land Grant plus No Sewer Bonds , 4o-GallonFast-Recovery Water Heaters , and Sidewalks In " ; at Rancho Valley , selling points included a leaded-glass windowon the exterior of each three-car attached garage , for " the same gracious finish throughout , VETS NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had only to consider Riverside City , the most distinctive feature of which was that it was " dedicated to the concept of Retirement . " Another distinctive feature of Riverside City was that it was a project initiated by Dupree Development Inc. , and another was that Ryder Channing had in February been placed in nominal charge of development , but never mind that . It was a far , far grander scheme than might be indicated by the fact that Ryder was in charge of it . Althoughnone of Riverside City 's projected 37,000 houses had yet been built , quarter-acre lots had been sold by agents all over the country , an artificial lake was under construction , and esprit among future citizens was renewedweekly by the four-page Riverside City Sun , mailed from the Dupree Building in Oakland . " QUESTION : Although we live at present in Chicago , we enjoy ourp210subscription to the Sun because we intend to build a home on our lot in the near future . My question is , about the plastic lining now being installed in the bottomof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar ? ANSWER : You can relax . The lining will be covered with six inches of earth , so unless you come out to inspect it now , you 'll never even see it . QUESTION : What kind of plants grow best in Riverside City ? ANSWER : We suggest you correspond with two of our pioneer citizensto-be , the Mesdames Ada Travers and Bertha Kling , foundersof the Riverside City Garden Club . They have already collected an impressive file of government pamphlets on the horticulture of the area . There are no weeds growing under these ladies . " Some nights at dinner Martha would announce that she planned to take some land and develop it herself and make them all rich ; some nights she would sit at the table , not eating , and make Everett promise , again and again , that he and Sarah would never try to sell the ranch without her . Other nights she would not come to dinner at all , but would go instead to her room and lie in the dark with the sheet over her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be asleep . At six o'clock on the sixteenth of March , Martha was sitting in the bar at Del Paso Country Club wondering how it would feel to get laid in the rain on the golf course and listening to Sam Bradley , one of the river boys who had gone into real estate , explain how he had happened to join Del Paso : it was deductible and it was good business . Although they had been sitting in the bar an hour , Martha had seen no one she had ever seen before with two exceptions , the bartender and a gynecologist 's wife whose pic/ture was frequently in the paper in connection with the Opera Guild . " Meet a President , " the pictures were always captioned . " No Stranger to the Gavel . " No matter how hard you tried it was difficult to keep up with who was who now , and on the whole Martha would rather be on the golf course , but there were always too many people , everywhere . Did Sam know any of these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it make if he knew any of these people . All he wanted to do , as he had been telling her off and on for twenty minutes , was get the hell out of here and drive up to that Mexican place in Jackson for dinner . She loved that Mexican place . She had told him three times she loved that Mexican place . But Jackson was fifty miles away and it had been raining for three days and she really did not feel like driving fifty miles and back in the rain in his Austin-Healey . They could get another car . They could get his brother 's car . They could get her car . He had n't planned to take the goddamn Austin-Healey . Since both his brother 's car and her car were approximatelythirty-five miles from Del Paso and in the opposite direction from Jackson , that made it a drive of eighty-five miles each way . Besides , she did not even think the Mexicanplace was open week nights . Anyway there was illegal gambling there and he did not want , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be very good business , would it . Go to hell , he said . He would telephone ahead . All right , she said , go find out , and as Sam got up from the table she saw Ryder Channing walk in from the golf course with a balding fat man . It was the first time she had seen Ryder without Nancy Dupree since December and she was faintly depressed to find that she still could notp212look at him as she looked at other people . She had seen him walking through the door and had thought Ryder , just as she always had , without any of the instant judgments she normally made about people she saw . She had been making judgments upon Sam Bradley from the moment he picked her up ; she had already made maybe twenty small judgmentsupon the man with Ryder . But when she looked at Ryder all she thought was Ryder . The other man was , she learned when Ryder brought him to the table , a Cadillac dealer from down the Valley who played , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf . " The rain put you off your game , " Martha suggested to the Cadillac dealer . He shrugged . " You must have known Martha 's father , " Ryder said , not looking at Martha . " Who 's your dad , Marty ? " " John McClellan . " The Cadillac dealer looked blankly at Ryder . " Sure . Sure I know him . I probably run into him at Sacramento Rotary . " " I do n't think so , " Martha said . " Actually he 's been dead since 1944 . " " Well , " said the dealer , " I was n't here in 1944 . " " How you been ? " Martha asked Ryder . " I 'm fine . You look real good . " " I 've been sleeping and eating a lot . I hear you 're living in the old Carmelo place . " " A friend of Bugsy 's family bought it and lent it to us until he decides what to do with it . We 're going to build as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great little girl , " the dealer said . " The finest . " " I always liked the Carmelo place . " Martha smoothedp213her gloves in her lap . " They gave a dance once on the third floor and lined both the stairways with azalea . It was about the first dance I ever went to . " " Termites , " the dealer said . " Rotten with termites . " " Bugsy wants one storey , " Ryder said . " Where is she ? " the Cadillac dealer demanded querulously . " Why are n't they here ? " He turned to Martha . " She 's shopping with my wife . Mitzi said they 'd meet us here at six-thirty . " " It 's not quite six-thirty , " Ryder said . " I saw you last week at Nancy Slaughter 's . You were just leaving . " " That 's right , " she said . " We were there a few minutes . " " Listen , Marth . " He absently transferred some change from one pocket to another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be out the river road tomorrow . Maybe I 'll stop by . " " I wo n't be home . But I 'm sure Lily and Everett would like seeing you . " " Some other time . " He stood up as Sam came back . " Remember me to your dad , Marty , " the Cadillac dealer said . " Hasty luego for now . " When Ryder arrived the next afternoon at two o'clock Martha was alone in the house : Lily had taken China Mary and the children to have their chest X-rays ; Everett was out working on the levees . The rain had gone to the mountains and was melting the snow too fast . Although Lily had wanted Martha to come have her chest X-rayed with them ( " Talk about sickly , you look tubercular right now " ) , Martha had refused : she wanted to lie down . She had not gotten home from Jackson until three A.M. , and Sam Bradley , although she had told him it was not good business , had stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p214she  had ended up screaming at him ; she did not know what had happened but it was the same thing that always happened . She would have a couple of drinks or simply get very tired or sometimes just wake up in the morning despisingsomeone , everyone . If it happened in the morning she could lie there , hating , until it wore itself out , but if it happened around people she always ended up screaming . The very presence of Sam Bradley had seemed a personal affront to her : his bow tie a monument to both his vacuity and her lack of taste ; his enthusiasm for the Mexican place in Jackson an affectation so transparent that she was mortifiedto have abetted it ( he had greeted the cook warmly as " Mamacita , " and Martha had looked on with approval ) ; his brand of cigarettes ( not her own ) the crushing evidence of his mediocrity , his blatancy , his subtle lack of the male principle . It had begun when Sam said that no matter what Everett said , Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun as well had he merely said he liked her dress , or did not like a book he was reading . She had once turned viciously on Ryder for changing his shirt before dinner . His vanity . His shallowness . His carelessness . His thoughtlessness , his selfishness . Did he think the whole world existed simply to provide him with clean shirts . Even remembering it , she felt quite dizzy with loathing for Ryder . " I thought you might be here , " Ryder said when she opened the door . " I 'm trying to sleep . " She did not ask him to take off his raincoat but simply stood there , trying for once to examine him closely , to make some final damning judgment . She remembered once seeing in his apartment a postcardfrom a girl , possibly even Nancy Dupree  --  it had beenp215signed " XXXX and you know what , from B "  --  which read " Loved seeing you Saturday nite you looked so sexy in your white pants . " Although " sexy " was not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Ryder that way for several days . But all she had seen , then as now , was Ryder , and when she said , the next time he wore white pants , " You look fat-assed in those pants , Ryder , they do n't flatter you , " it was no judgment , only response . " What are you looking at , " he said . " I 've been trying to sleep , " she repeated , defeated . " I 'm not looking at anything . " Fifteen minutes later he had her down on the floor ; she had refused to go near the couch . " You want it , " he said . She had her legs crossed and her face turned away from him . " I do not . " " What difference do you think it makes now . " He pushed her skirt up around her waist . " After I 've screwed you maybe four , five times a week every week for the past five years . " " Four and a half years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four and a half years . " " I never wanted it . " Recognizing immediately that this clear untruth tended only to weaken her position , she amended it : " A lot of times I only pretended to want it . " " You want it now , all right . You do n't have to start acting half-assed with me . " After he had gone ( Whose girl ? Your girl ) Martha went upstairs and lay on her bed until she heard , just as it was getting dark , the children 's voices downstairs . She found Lily in the kitchen , pulling off Julie 's galoshes . " Where 's Everett ? " she asked . " Still working on the levees . I do n't know . "  | " I 'm going to see if I can find him . " Martha pulled on a raincoat , buttoned it briskly , and then , as if she had forgottenwhy she wanted the raincoat in the first place , sat down and slowly began to unbutton it again . " You 're undoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Martha 's lap . " Where you going ? " Martha smoothed Julie 's hair . " I guess nowhere . I guess I could n't find him . " " I guess not , " Julie agreed . She was the kind of child who agreed with anything said by an adult . " You coming to the parade ? " " What parade is that ? " " The Saint Patrick 's Day Parade . It 's Saint Patrick 's Day in town . " " Who all 's going ? " " Me and Mommy and Knight . Only Knight ca n't go ifhe does n't apologize for breaking my pedometer . " " Knight broke your pedometer ? However will youfigure mileage ? " " That 's the thing . Anyway , two of our cousins are in it . " " In what ? " " In the parade , " Lily said . " You are n't following this very closely . Sally Randall 's children are marching and I thought we should go wave at them . We 're going to have hamburgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I guess I 'm dressed all right . I do n't guess I have to get all done up for the Saint Patrick 's Day Parade , do I. You know what it 'll be . There 'll be a bagpipe band playing The Campbells Are Coming . ' The Air Force Band playing Loch Lomond . ' And a battalion of small girls in spangled two-piece bathing suits and white plastic Stetsons doing close-order drill to Temptation . ' You-came-Ah was **27;3935;TOOLONG were Taymp-tay-shun . " " Martha , " Julie screamed , throwing herself at Martha 's knees . " Stop making fun . "  | " I 'm not making fun . " Martha picked Julie up and swung her around . " I am telling you gospel . Because baby , I have seen Saint Patrick 's Day before , seen it all . ' Temptation ' will be sung  --  through a public-address system on a truck behind the small girls  --  by a mother wearing a rose crepe dress with bugle beads , a short red car coat , and harlequin-framed glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sheriff 's Posse : fifteen dentists on fifteen palominos . And Julie baby , we 're so wide open out here there 'll probablyeven be the Masons . " " The Masons are not our cousins . " " That 's right , baby . The Randalls are our cousins . " Lily stood up and picked up a lipstick from the shelf beside the sink . " You coming or not ? " Suddenly listless , Martha did not answer . " If you 're coming you better put on some shoes . " " What time is it ? " " Six . A little before . " " I was supposed to go somewhere . Sam Bradley and hisbrother were supposed to pick me up at six-thirty . " Lily blotted her lipstick on a piece of paper toweling andlooked at Martha . " Then you ca n't come . " " Yes I can . I can come all right . " Martha stood up and took from the pocket of her raincoat the dark glasses she wore almost constantly now . " You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to call Sam I 'd call him , I mean would n't I ? " By the time they had driven into town ( " Knight can look for Nevada plates and Julie for Arizona . That 's right , there are more people in Arizona but you forget Nevada is closer . All right , both of you look for Arizona plates " ) and stopped at a drive-in for hamburgers ( " I said ham/burgers , Knight , I did not say steak sandwich and I did not say chicken-in-a-basket . All right , chiliburgers . You do n't even like chili " ) , the parade was already underway : they had missed , a policeman told them as Lily was locking the station wagon , the Mayor 's Cavalcade and the Knights of Columbus . " Cheer up , sweetie , " he said to Julie . " There 'll be more . " " You bet there will , sweetie , " Martha whispered , gigglingwith Julie as fifteen palominos pranced into view , and then Knight was yelling Hey Horse ! Why did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not a horse at all but the name by which Sally Randall 's son was known to his intimates ; not long after Horse Randall and the Elk Grove Firehouse Five passed by , followed by a shivering blond drum majorette and a ragged line of highschoolboys whistling and hooting , the rain began again , and when they looked for Martha she was gone . By the time they saw her , standing in front of the Rexall drugstore on the corner , the crowd was breaking up , going for cover , scattering into doorways and automobiles . " Meet us at the car , " Lily shouted over the idling of motors , the shifting of gears . Instead Martha ran back down the block to where Lily stood with the children . Rain streamed down her face , across her sunglasses , down the neck of her unbuttoned raincoat . " I was trying to call Sarah . Nobody answered . " " Sarah ? In Philadelphia ? " Martha took Julie 's hand and followed Lily and Knight to the station wagon . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , lifting Julie into the middle seat . " The parade , " Lily repeated after her , fumbling beneath the brake pedal for the keys she had just found and dropped.  | " Honestly , " Martha said . " You 'd think there might have been somebody there . " " You can try her again when we get home . " Lily fitted the key into the ignition with meticulous care while she tried to work the parade , the rain , and Sarah into some reasonablesequence . " By then it 'll be after midnight in Philadelphia . Maybe they 'll be home then . " " Oh no , " Martha said . " It 's only five-thirty there now . The man in the Rexall told me . " " It 's almost eight-thirty here . You know it 's later there . " " I 'm sure I do n't know why the man in the Rexall would have told me a deliberate lie . " " If he told you that he just did n't know . We know . " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what to believe . " Lily switched on the windshield wipers but did not start the engine . " Anyway it 's too late , " Martha said . " If it 's midnight there , as you insist it is , it 's too late . " " Too late for what ? " Martha leaned against the window and took off her sunglasses . Her eyes were closed . " I do n't know , " she said . " I did n't want to go home and I thought I might go there , but it 's too late . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Sarah . I 'm talking about my sister . I wanted to talk to Sarah . If you do n't mind . "  |p220They  buried Martha 's body beneath the cherry tree near the levee on the morning of the twenty-second of March . Everett and Henry Sears ( who had been sleeping off the flu and a four-day drunk when Everett had the night before begun shouting and pounding at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out here ) carried the coffin : a long rope-handled sea chest , packed for the past thirty years with Mildred McClellan 's linens , ends of lace , a box of jet beading from a dress , and the ivory fan carried by Martha 's great-great-grandmother Currier at Governor Leland Stanford 's Inaugural Ball in 1862 ; unpacked the night before when Everett said I 'm telling you for the last time , Lily , get McGrath out of here , get his deputy out of here , and get that son of a bitch quack doctor out of here , she 's my sister , I 'm going to bury her , and I 'm going to bury her on the ranch . Lily walked behind them , her arms full of flowers.  |p221Everett  had been out before dawn , pulling up every daffodilleft after the rain , tearing down whole branches of camellias . When they reached the place Everett had chosen they laid the sea chest on the wet ground , and Everett spelled Sears digging the grave . Numb with the morning cold , Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every hour now , the river ran faster and higher with the melting mountain snow : tearing at the banks , jamming together logs and debris and then smashing through the jams . As she watched Sears dig it occurred to her that Martha 's body could well be washed out by evening , the unnailed lid of the sea chest ripped open and Martha free again in the water in the white silk dress with the butterflies . ( $250 , I should wear it every day , every evening , and every night to bed , she had said last night when she was dressing for the party and Lily had warned the rain might spot the silk , Just ask Everett if I should n't . ) It was not right to bury her this way : McGrath had said it ( I 'm telling you , Everett , it 's against the law of the State of California ) ; Edith Knight had said it this morning when she came in her robe to pick up the children ( I 'm not talking about the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undertakers ' lobby . I 'm talking about what 's right and what 's wrong ) ; the doctor had said it ; she had said it herself . Everett baby you do n't know what you 're doing . They had each said it for different reasons and Everett had listened to none of them . " You hear it rising ? " Everett said , looking up at the levee . Sears stopped digging to fasten his jacket against the wind . " Going to crest at thirty-eight . " " When 's that ? " " Near to noon . Thiel 's Landing . " Sears was **37;3964;TOOLONG felt by the Afghan men for such a person , and as we watched she skillfully led the goat back to its tether . " Makes me feel good to know that such people are also a part of Afghanistan , " I observed as we walked away . " They 're not our people , " Nur corrected . " In the winter they go to India . In the summer they go north . They use us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belong to ? " I asked . " I never considered the matter , " Nur replied . " Legally , I supposethey 're Indians . " It was night when we approached the Ghazni gate , on whose ramparts flickering lights moved back and forth . It was a solemn moment , at the end of day , when the ancient city was settling down for sleep , and we paused to watch the towers etched in the glow from some improvised fire where travelers outside the city were roasting a sheep . In after years , whenever I have thought of an Afghan city it has been Ghazni , looming in the darkness . When we passed the scene of the execution Nur Muhammad begged , " Do n't look again , Miller Sahib . This is our shame . " And we returned to the square , where shadowy lights illuminated the corner cafe . We took our seats at the table and good-natured men elbowed up to us to discuss the day 's events ; and against my will I found myself entangled with these bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet who were so hungry to know about America . They ate our nan and shared our pilau . They told us of the problems facing Ghazni  --  the food supply , the taxes and the cost of horses  --  and at the end of our meal they walked with us to our hotel , where they entered and sat for hours , cross-legged on the Persian rugs , talking . . , . talking ...  |p101Shortly  after dawn we left Ghazni , passing on the way the scene of execution , from which the stake had been removed , for wood in Afghanistan was precious . The stones , however , were left convenientlyscattered in case another culprit should be apprehended . We had been on the road for less than an hour when I discoveredan important fact about Afghanistan which none of my reading had discussed ; yet it was so fundamental that if one missed its significance he missed the meaning of this country . I refer to the bridges of Afghanistan . When we came to the first one I did not appreciate its im/portance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , I judged , by some expert engineer . It was well designed , contained good stonework and was ornamented by four crenelated towers . Unfortunately , a recent flood had eaten away the approaches to the bridge , leaving it an isolated structure that now served no useful purpose . To cross the river we had to leave the road , descend by gullies to the river , ford it , and reverse the process until we climbed back onto the road . Obviously , in time of storm traffic on the road would halt , but I remember thinking , while fording the river : That 's a handsome bridge . . almost a work of art . Thirty minutes later we came upon an even more beautiful bridge , with eight towers done in the most sturdy style , a kind of military Gothic common to old French and German towns . I was a splendid structure and I studied it with some care , for which I had ample time since its approaches had also been washed away . We were thus forced once more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from below . The stonework was exemplary ; the joints were interesting because I could not detect how they were sealed . It looked as if the architect had depended upon the skill of his cutters to give him a joint which held of its own friction and weight . Moreover the structure was well designed , with the eight towers adding a strikingnote . It was a bridge to admire , and only the advent of some unexpected flood had rendered it useless . But when we came to the third fine bridge and found its approachesgone too , I grew irritated and asked Nur Muhammad , " Are all the bridges like this ? " " They are , " he said sadly . " Why ? " " We call them Bridges Afghan Style . ' They ca n't be used . " " What happened ? " I demanded . " Afghanistan 's folly , " he said , and it was obvious that he wished to drop the matter . At the seventh washed-out bridge we had to ford a river muchp103deeper than we had anticipated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our engine useless , waiting till a truck came along to haul us out . We had nothing to do but study the bridge overhead , and it was perhaps the loveliest of all : its arch was graceful , its turrets solid , its brickwork neat , and its impression substantial . " Beautiful bridge , " I admitted grudgingly . " Who built it ? " " A German . One of the worst tragedies that ever hit our nation . " It was a pleasure to talk with Nur , for he spoke idiomatic English while I was fairly competent in Pashto ; for practice we liked a system whereby I spoke in his language and he replied in mine , but when discussing complex subjects each used his own language . To an outsider our conversation would be confusing , for often we switched languages in midsentence . Now , with my bottom wet and cold , I was angry and spoke in harsh Pashto . " What happened with these bridges , Nur ? " He replied in careful Pashto . " A disaster . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Germans said , It 's stupid to have your two major cities unconnected by a road . ' They arranged a big loan and gave us experts who surveyed the road and showed how it could be built . When the king saw the survey , very neatly drawn with little pictures , he approved and said , We 're a modern country now . We must have a modem road . ' Then he asked who would build the bridges , and the Germans lent us a learned professor-architect who had built many bridges , and the work started . " Nur pointed up at the bridge . " He was a brilliant man who demanded the best . Look at that brickwork . You do n't find much of that in Afghanistan . It was his idea to mark each bridge with distinctive turrets and ornamentation , for he told us , A bridge is more than a bridge . It 's a symbol connecting past and present . ' He said that towers and intricate brickwork were part of the Afghan soul . In a famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the idea of towers from the family forts that mark Afghanistan . "  | " I did n't see the relationship , " I remarked , but Nur pointed down the river toward a private fort and then I knew what the professor-architect had been after . " He built some twenty bridges , " Nur explained as we sat in the cold river  --  and I mean in the river , for the jeep kept settling  --  " and all the time he was working , a handful of Afghans like Shah Khan and my father kept warning him , Doctor , that bridge is fine for a well-controlled European river , but has anyone told you about our Afghan rivers in the spring ? ' He replied angrily that he had built bridges over some of the finest rivers in Europe . . . much greater rivers , he assured us , than these trivial desert streams . " Nur looked sadly at the bridge and said in English , " You understand , of course , that this all happened before I was born . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father telling us later , We went to the government and warned them , " Those German bridges will not stand up against our rivers in the spring . " ' They were told , You think you 're smart enough to tell a German how to do his job ? A man who has built bridges all over Europe ? ' My father replied that he had never seen a Europeanriver and it looked to him as if the German had never seen an Afghan river , and there the matter was left . " The jeep settled deeper and Nur said in English , " Shah Khan is a learned man and a brave one . In those days he was without the dignity of his present position , but he refused to drop the matter . He told the Germans "  --  and here Nur Muhammad reverted to Pashto  --  " These bridges are far more important to us than they are to you . They 're our first contact with the western world . If they succeed , we who want to modernize this nation will succeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , Professor-Architect , listen when I tell you that sometimes in the spring what you call our trivial desert streams roar out of the mountains two miles wide . They move boulders as big as houses . They destroy everything not perched on a hill . And the next day they 're little streams again . Professor , build us big broad bridges and leave off the pretty towers . '  | " The German professor was furious that Shah Khan would dare speak to him directly . He insisted that a meeting of government be convened , at which he made an impassioned speech . I want to tell you that I have sunk my pillars to bedrock . I have built as no bridges in Afghanistan have ever been built before . When the floods that Shah Khan speaks of meet my bridges not one bridge will fall down . ' I must say that Shah Khan was a fighter . He replied , Professor-Architect , you 're entirely right . The bridges will not fall down . Of that I 'm convinced . But the rivers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy head on . Your stout bridges are like the British army . Their soldiers were ten times better than ours . . . better fed . . . better armed . But we did n't march up to the British in double file so they could shoot us down . In a thousand tricky ways we surrounded them . They protested , " This is no decent way to fight , " and we destroyed them . Our rivers will destroy your bridges , Professor-Architect , because they 're European bridges and they 're not prepared to fight Afghan rivers . What we want , and Shah Khan shouted , Not in Afghanistan . ' The quarrel was taken to the king himself , and he ordered Shah Khan to shut up . The German ambassadorexplained everything by pointing out that Shah Khan had been educated in France and was thus emotionally unstable . " So the bridges were built , and the next year there were no spring floods . For eighteen months we enjoyed a wonderful road between Kabul and Kandahar , and Afghanistan was spurting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a great snowfall in the mountains followed by an unusually warm spring , which sent towering floods down the gullies , moving boulders as big as houses . When these floods struck the bridges , the German was proved right . His stone pillars stood fast , as he had predicted . The bridges were as strong as he said . But they were so narrow in span that our rivers simply went around them . All the approaches were gouged out and the bridges stood isolated . " " Why not rebuild the approaches ? " I asked  | " We did , " Nur replied . " Another flood took them out . So we rebuiltagain . Another flood . My father calculated that to keep the bridges operating would require a hundred thousand men working around the year . So after the third flood the government said , Let them go . Who needs bridges ? ' And the dream road that was to have bound our nation together remained an aching monument to the folly of man . " " What happened to the professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he traveled from Kabul to Kandahar , refusing to believe what he saw . I 've built a hundred bridges over some of the greatest rivers in Europe , ' he shouted . He stood in the middle of one little stream two feet deep and wailed , How could this little puddle wash out a bridge ? ' He refused , even then , to see the boulders which that little puddle had moved down from the mountain . " " Did he leave the country ? " " No , he went back to Kabul and boasted to everyone who would listen that not a single one of his pillars had been destroyed . He made himself what the English call quite a bore . ' He insisted upon explaining about the bridges . The German embassy finally called him in , and what they said we never found out , but that night he went to his room and blew his brains out . " Nur shook his head sadly , still waiting for a truck to appear . " You ca n't imagine the tragedy those bridges became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mullahs and the mountain chiefs would laugh : Remember the German bridges ! ' You 're an American and you may not like Germans since you fought them twice , but in Afghanistan they were wonderful people . Most of what we have that 's good came from the Germans , but after the bridges even they were held in suspicion . Their effectivenesswas chopped in half . Those damned bridges ! " He shook his head , then asked , " By the way , you 're meeting a German doctor in Kandahar , are n't you ? " " How did you know ? " I asked . As soon as I uttered the words I could have kicked myself . Perhapsit was the coldness of the river that had made me thoughtless ,  |p107but  the damage was done . Nur stammered , " Well , I just know . " It was a rule in Afghan-American relations that neither side would embarrass the other regarding spies like Nur Muhammad on their side and Richardson on ours . It 's true that Nur had slipped when he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of my missions in Kandahar was to inspect Dr. Otto Stiglitz ; he should have kept his mouth shut . But once he did betray himself , I should never have challenged him . I had humiliated a good friend and an able spy . I was sorry . He recovered by saying , " In a few miles . . . if we ever get out of this river . . . you 'll see a bridge that my father and Shah Khan built . You 'll laugh at it , but it 's stood for more than thirty years . " A truck finally arrived and shouting men plunged into the river with ropes , which they attached to our front axle . With relative ease they pulled us free , then refused pay . We offered them cigarettes , which gratified them , and with much laughter they assured us that the rivers to the south would give no trouble . " But in two more weeks . Wh000 , wh000 ! Floods everywhere . Road washed out for six or seven days . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I tell you , Miller Sahib , that we have an Afghan way of doing things , and it works , please do n't think I 'm being obstinate . It 's just possible that it does work . " " On the other hand , " I argued , " if your country operates on unique solutions which no outsider can possibly understand , and if you use that as an excuse for doing nothing , then Russia will surely move in and make the changes for you . " " That 's the battle we 're engaged in , you and I , " Nur agreed . " May we complete the job before Russia takes over . " " My government 's policy is to help you , " I said . " But do be reasonable on one thing , Miller Sahib . We 'll soon be in Kandahar , and you 'll be forming opinions about Nazrullah . Let me assure you , he 's on our side . He understands these matters better than either of us . Do n't antagonize him at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . "  | " I do n't want to destroy him , " I snapped . " I want to find out where his wife is . " " So do I , " Nur promised . " But in the Afghan way . " I was about to make an acid reply when Nur stopped our jeep at the bridge his father had built across one of the lesser streams , which the Germans had left for later . It was a silly affair that looked like a roller coaster at a run-down amusement park . It was built of wood and showed no evidence of European beauty , but it looked good for a hundred years . I thought : If a German **26;4003;TOOLONG a bridge like this they 'd hang him from the Brandenburger Tor . " The secret , " Nur pointed out , " is the big dips in the road before you reach the bridge itself . See how they work ? " " Not exactly , " I replied . With his forefinger he drew in the dust on the jeep windshield a profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , rose again to cross the bridge , then dipped on the other side . Nur 's diagram looked like a scraggly capital W. " You might call it an Afghan bridge . It says to the river , I want to cross you , but I know I must n't pinch you in . So when you want to run wild , go down the dips in the road and leave me alone . The rest of the year I 'll leave you alone . ' Silly , but it works . " Hesitantly I asked , " But during the flood you ca n't use the road ? " " Of course not , " Nur agreed . " But if you allow the river its way , it closes the road only once or twice a year . Who needs a road all year ? Maybe it 's better to give it a rest . " I thought of six good answers to this evasion , but I was constrainedfrom using them by one overriding fact : while crossing rivers which the German had tried to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricky Afghan bridge my bottom was dry , and things had been this way for nearly fifty years . I kept my mouth shut . We were about to resume our journey when a truck came down the road from Ghazni bearing a strange group of men who were dressed in vivid clothes of many colors and who wore their blackp109hair long in the manner of ancient Greek page boys : thick bangs in front , elsewhere a shoulder-length bob . The faces of the men were aquiline and paler than those of the normal Afghan . All were handsome but there was one young man not yet in his twenties , I judged , who was positively beautiful . At first I was n't sure he was a man and I must have pointed toward him as the truck crossed the bridge , for in Pashto he screamed a very filthy phrase , which caused his truckmates to cheer his insolence . In acknowledgmenthe made a pretty gesture like a girl , but he was startled when I shouted back in Pashto a phrase equally obscene . He laughed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed in the sunlight . Then he pointed at me with a languid , graceful arm and shouted , " I know what the ferangi wants , but he ca n't have it . " Once more the men in the truck applauded their special member , and proceeded on their way to Kandahar . " Who were they ? " I asked . " A dancing team , " Nur replied . " They tour the country all year . " " The long hair ? " " Traditional . Judging from their clothes they must be a pretty good team . " We had completed most of the trip to Kandahar when we overtooka young man in his early twenties , conspicuous because he wore not only the customary baggy pants and long shirt , but also a tattered overcoat made originally for a woman . It must have been a beautiful coat , with long flaring panels and a tight waist , and looked as if it might have come from Paris . Wine-red in color , it still possessed an air of grace . I asked Nur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and his eyes widened with pleasure . He climbed in the back and adjusted his coat carefully over the spare tires on which he had to crouch . " Ever been in a car before ? " I asked in Pashto . " No . It 's exciting . " " Going to Kandahar ? " " Yes . To the spring festival . "  | " Ever been before ? " " No , " he replied with a flashing smile . " But I 've heard of Kandahar . Who has n't ? " " Where do you live ? " " In the hills . Badakshar . " " I do n't know it , " I said to Nur , who with four or five pinpoint questions developed that it was several hundred miles north . " Must be a dump , " he said in English . " Good place ? " I asked in Pashto . " Oh , yes ! " the young man replied warmly . " Last year we had a good crop . In the autumn I sold a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am coming to Kandahar with some money , I can tell you . " As soon as he said this he realized that his boasting might cost him his life , for he did not know who we were , and travelers were frequently murdered when it was known they had money . No doubt it had sometimes happened near Badakshar , and he looked at us fearfully . " Shut your mouth , you fool , " Nur snapped . " This time you 're lucky . We 're from the government . " The young man sighed and fell silent , but I asked him , " Where 'd you get your coat ? " He was a congenial fellow who enjoyed talk , so he said quickly , " It 's been in my family for many years . My father wore it to Kabul once . I have n't been to Kabul , but my brother wore it to Herat , which is a large city , he says . " " Where 'd your father get the coat ? " The young man refused to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , did n't he ? " The traveler said nothing and Nur continued . " A stranger came through the mountains wearing this coat and your father got hungry for it . So he shot him , eh ? " I turned around to look at the young man , across whose face had come a beatific smile . He said , " You government men know everything , do n't you ? How to raise sheep . How to pay taxes . What roads to build . But you do n't know about this coat , do you ? "  |p111He  chuckled and in sheer pleasure wrapped his arms a little tighter about himself . " Who killed who ? " Nur pressed . The young man laughed openly and wagged his finger at Nur . " No , no , Mr. Government ! That 's one thing you 're not going to know . And before you ask any more questions stop the car and I ' 11 walk . " " Take it easy , " Nur said . " All right , " the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We rode in silence for some miles , then heard a gasp from the rear of the jeep , for our rider had spotted some of the minarets of Kandahar . " It 's the city ! " he cried . At first I saw nothing , but gradually the outlines of Kandahar , much older than Kabul , stood out against the horizon , and as we approached the walls I could not say who was the more excited , the young man with the European coat or the man from the Americanembassy about to engage in his first diplomatic mission . We dropped our passenger in the middle of the city , a sprawling , dirty , camel-train metropolis whose mud walls looked as they had in the time of Darius the Persian . Nur found us a place to stay , much better than the hole in Ghazni but without the Persian rugs , and when the jeep was under armed guard I said , " Since you already know I 'm here to see Dr. Stiglitz , could you find where he lives ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I repeated , and he soon returned to lead me down a mean , narrow street where from one dirty mud wall projected the signDOKTORUNIVERSITY OF MUNICH " Want me to stay with you ? " Nur asked . " No thanks . " " Kandahar is rougher than Kabul , " Nur warned " I can handle myself , " I assured him and entered the doctor 's quarters . The waiting room startled me . It was a small , dirt-floored , misshapenroom with one bench and two very old chairs , on which sat men in turbans . One rose to offer me his seat , but I said in Pashto , " I 'll stand , " and the bronzed faces stared at me . Finally one asked , " Ferangi ? " and I replied " American . " The staring continued . After some minutes the door leading to the doctor 's office opened and a turbaned man departed . The next patient in line moved in to see the doctor and he must have said that there was a ferangi outside , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle height rushed out , not to see me but to inspectme . " Who are you ? " he demanded in crisp , accented English . I gave my name and he drew back suspiciously . " What do you want ? " I tried to say that I 'd wait until he was through , but he interrupted , shouting in Pashto , " These damned Americans come here demanding special privilege . They always do . Well , he must wait in line till all of you are finished . . . all of you . " In Pashto I said , " When you 're through , Doctor . " My use of the language did not impress him . He stepped back , eyed me coldly and asked cautiously , " What is it you want ? " " Did you ever treat the American wife of Nazrullah ? " He glared at me , drew a protective shell of some kind about himself , and returned to his office , slamming the crude wooden door . In a flash he was back in the waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line like all of you . . . to the very end . " Once more he slammed the door . By the time the last Afghan had seen the doctor , darkness had fallen and I was left alone in the shadowy waiting room . The wooden door creaked open and Dr. Stiglitz said graciously , " Now perhaps we can talk . " He did not invite me to his office , but he did leave the door open so that some light from the single unshaded electric bulb entered our room . He was balding , with a blond-gray Germanp113crew cut , and he had a pipe . He looked more frightened than bellicose , and his forehead was deeply wrinkled . " Yes , I treated MadameNazrullah . Not quite a year ago . Sit down . " He invited me to take one of the rickety chairs while he sat wearily on the other . " Be careful of the chair , " he warned . " In Afghanistan wood is so scarce that any chair is a treasure . You ca n't imagine the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed it so , but visitors make me nervous . " He made a conscious effort to relax and asked with some show of generosity , " Now what do you wish to know ? " Before I could speak , the door to the street opened and a thin Afghan in his fifties entered , followed by a chaderi . The woman stood obediently near the door while the man bowed and pleaded with the doctor . " My wife is ill , " the man whispered . " All right , " Stiglitz growled in what I thought was an offensive manner . " She 's late , but I 'll help her . " With no enthusiasm he returned to his office , and I moved my chair aside to let the woman follow , but she was left standing in the outer room and it was the nervous husband who joined the doctor . Stiglitz , seeing my surprise , said , " You 'd better come in here . He would n't like you alone with his wife , and what happens may interest you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghan husband consulted in the inner room while the sick woman remainedstanding by the door of the waiting room . " Tell her she can sit down , " the doctor began , and the husband went to his wife , who obediently sat on the floor . While he was gone I had an opportunity to inspect the doctor 's office . It was a dirty little mud-floored room with practically no medical equipment and one cupboard containing flyspecked bottles of pills . There was a desk made of packing crates and the swinging , glaring electric light bulb . The husband returned and Stiglitz asked , " Now what 's wrong ? " " Pains in the stomach , Doctor . " " Fever ? " " Yes . " " High ? " " No , medium . "  | " Does she vomit ? " " No . " " Pregnant ? " " The midwife says no . " " Is her period regular ? " " I do n't know . " " Find out , " Stiglitz ordered , and the husband dutifully returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consult with his veiled wife . While he was gone I asked , " Do n't you examine her ? " " A wife ? In chaderi ? 1 'd be shot . " The husband returned and said his wife 's periods had been regular , so the examination proceeded . Six times the husband was ordered to ask his wife intimate questions regarding her health and six times he relayed his understanding of her answers to the doctor . Once , when the man was gone , Stiglitz confided , " The real evil of this system comes when the husband thinks his wife 's symptomsreflect discredit on him . He suppresses the information . And if the apothecary charges too much for the medicine I prescribe he simply does n't buy it . " " What happens to the woman ? " I asked . " She dies , " he replied without emotion . " That is , she dies a little sooner than otherwise . " The husband now decided that he had told Dr. Stiglitz all that was relevant and he waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stiglitz said in English , " but after a while you instinctively know what ails the woman and you probably do her as much good as if you 'd taken her pulse and temperature . " In Pashto he instructed the husband what medication to buy for his wife and the man laid down a pitiful fee , which the doctor accepted . When the man went to inform his wife he left the door open and I could see him kneel beside her and console and reassureher , with obvious love etched on his face . His wife , who must have been seriously ill under the chaderi , breathed deeply two or three times , then rose and followed her husband out of the office . " Now about Madame Nazrullah , " Dr. Stiglitz began . " Sincep115you 're interested in her you must be from the American embassy . " " I am . " " And you 've been sent down here to spy on me ? " " No , " I lied . " You 're lying . Right this minute you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hole like Kandahar ? Go ahead and spy on me and I 'll spy on you . " Before I could reply , Stiglitz hopped up , ran to the door leading to the street , and barred it . When this was done he sat on one of the chairs , using it in reversed position so that its unsteady back formed a chin rest . " Young man , " he said . " Will you please bring me my pipe ? " He was tired and he looked it . I joined him in the waiting room and studied him as he lit his pipe . His hands were nervous , but I remembered that this was the end of a long day . His close-cropped head was a little larger than normal , and his hard blue eyes looked at all things with a blend of cynicism and challenge . He was inclined toward plumpness and was clearly no self-reliant German superman . I was disposed to like his quick honesty and felt intuitively that he ought to move to Kabul , where the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he had foreseen , the major question in my mind as I studied him was , " What 's a man like this doing in a hole like Kandahar ? " " Nazrullah 's wife lived in this region for a little more than a year , " he reported grudgingly . " Why are you interested ? " " She 's disappeared . " " What ? " he asked with real surprise . " Yes . Her parents have n't heard from her in thirteen months . " He began to laugh , not heartily but in disgust . " You Americans ! My parents have n't heard from me in four years but they do n't go running to the German embassy . " " With an American woman married to an Afghan the problem is somewhat different , " I said sharply . " Any ferangi who marries an Afghan does so with her eyes alert , " Stiglitz replied impatiently . " I treated Madame Nazrullah several times . "  | " What for ? " I asked . Stiglitz looked at me coldly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite happy with her husband and he with her . I 've grown to respect Nazrullah as one of the finest Afghans . Say , Herr Miller , are you hungry ? " " I am . " " You eat pilau and nan ? " " At every chance . " " Good . I 'm starved . " Then , for the first time , I saw him hesitate , as if he were unsure of himself . " Herr Miller , may I be very rude ? " " You may . " " I wish that the invitation I just extended could mean what it would in Germany . That I was taking you to dinner . Frankly , Herr Miller . . . You saw the fee they pay here . " " I 'm taking you to dinner , " I assured him . " No ! My own dinner I can afford . But sometimes you ferangi eat like such pigs . . . " He summoned a watchman , who appeared from a room in the back carrying a rifle and two daggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drugs , then unbarred the door , which the watchman locked behind us as soon as we had left . Stiglitz led me to the public square , which contained an eating place of better than average appearance . Cautiously he asked , " Do you like beer ? " " Not particularly . " " Good , " he sighed with real relief . " I manage to find a few bottleseach month and it makes life bearable . So if you do n't mind I 'll not offer you one . Why do n't you have an orange ? " " I usually drink tea . " " Better for you , " he laughed uneasily . When our meal was served , the waiter produced from some well-protected corner a bottle of lukewarm German beer , which Dr. Stiglitz attended to personally . With meticulous care he pried away the top , quickly pressing his mouth over the foamingp117bottle to catch each drop that would otherwise have been wasted . Next he took a long , slow , satisfying draught , closed his eyes , and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " What would you have said , " I asked , " if I had liked beer ? " He opened his eyes slowly and winked . " I 'd have said , How unfortunate . In Kandahar the mullahs allow no alcohol , ' and right now we 'd both be drinking tea . I wo n't try to explain , Herr Miller , but this is my only contact with Europe . It 's so precious . . . " " Would you have any guess as to why Nazrullah 's wife disap-peared ? " " I 'm not satisfied she has . " " Any rumors ? " " I give no credence to rumors . " " That means you 've heard some . " " Herr Miller , I had n't even heard she was missing . " " You had n't ? " " Why should I ? " he asked impatiently . " They left here last July to work at Qala Bist . Have n't seen them since . " " Was she all right . . . when you knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily , licking his fingers . " Who 's all right ? Maybe she was planning to murder her husband and have a baby by a camel . Who can you point to in Afghanistan and say , That one 's all right ' ? She was healthy , she laughed more than she cried , and she was well groomed . " " How do you know about the crying ? " " I do n't . Every time I saw her she was laughing . " It was obvious that he intended the interrogation to end , but I could not resist one final question . " Did you know her by her western name ? " Dr. Stiglitz threw down the piece of nan he had been using as a fork and sputtered , " No more ! Eat ! " He took a long swig of beer . This relaxed him and he asked philosophically , " Herr Miller , have you ever speculated as to why it was such a terrible punish/ment in these lands to cut off the hand of a thief ? No ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the right hand . Look around this restaurant and see if that gives you an idea . " There were perhaps fifteen eating areas in the dusty room and at each men were eating pilau , but I did n't see the connection . Stiglitzpointed out , " They 're all eating with their right hands , . See ! " He pointed to a rug on which five bearded Afghans were digging freely from a common bowl , and each used his right hand . The left never appeared in motion . " I do n't understand . " " Only the right hand is allowed in the food bowl , " Stiglitz said ponderously , like a German professor , " because when a man goes to the toilet he must always wipe himself with his left hand . In lands where there is little water , this is a prudent rule . " He took another drink of beer and reflected , " It was a terrifying punishment , to cut off a man 's right hand . Automatically it banished him from the food bowl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story when I saw two men rigging a string of lights across one corner of the square . " What goes on over there ? " I asked . " That 's for the dance , " he explained . " Spring festival brings out the dancing boys , the dirty little monsters . " I described the team I 'd seen on the truck and he banged his empty beer bottle . " That 's the kind . They 're all alike . Filthy ani-mals . " " The ones I saw looked fairly clean , " I protested . " Clean ? Yes , . Even perfumed . But they 're cruel little pederasts . . . sodomites . When they come to town they create a great evil . " " You astonish me , " I gulped. " 1 should n't . If you have a society where women are forbidden , men must volunteer for the female functions . " " I was remarking on that the other day . But not in this con-text . " " This is the context that counts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little whores . How could they otherwise afford the clothes they wear ? "  |p119The  lights were now in position and a stage was being marked off , about which began to cluster several hundred men in turbans and a few in karakul caps . From an alley which was to serve as dressing room a man in his fifties , whom I recognized from the truck , appeared to make a speech . " Let 's go see the little monsters , " Stiglitz proposed , and we walked slowly across the square to join the crowd . We were in time to hear the speaker assure us that he had brought to Kandahar the finest troupe of dancers in Afghanistan , who had just finished a season in Kabul , where they had danced for the king . Five musicianscame on stage , older men who played flutes , drums and a bucket-like fiddle containing at least twenty strings . The music had a standard Oriental , wailing quality , but also a fierce rhythm quite alien to countries like China and Japan . This was the throbbingmusic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek strains . As sound it was attractive ; as rhythm it was compelling . " I 've grown fond of the music , " Stiglitz said , " and these men are good . " They played for some minutes and induced in the crowd a subtle change . Men stopped talking . Bodies began swaying , and a sense of excitement became almost tangible . Then , with a shout , two young men in candy-striped costumes leaped out of the alley and began a whirling dance in which their long hair stood out straight from their heads . They were unlike western dancers , more controlled in their torsos , but more abandoned in the way they used their extremities and their heads . I whispered to Stiglitz , " Do you deny they 're artists ? " " It 's their other skills I object to , " he snapped . During the first half-hour the star of the troupe did not appear and the interval was filled with flying bodies and wild music . The audience seemed to grow impatient and it was clear they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge , and I too was waiting for him . The master of ceremonies knew this and took advantage of our anticipation by sending his musicians among the crowd to collect donations in their karakul fezzes . " What do I give ? " I asked the doctor.  | " As little as possible , " he growled , and I saw him throw in a few small coins , which caused the musician to sneer at him as a ferangi . I contributed a bill and gained a professional , ingratiating smile . The musicians reassembled and the master announced that we were now to see what we had been waiting for , the premier dancer of Afghanistan . The long thin drums , with goat leather at either end , began throbbing and flutes scurried up and down the register . The music halted and from the alley appeared , in the slowest of rhythmic steps , the young man who had made such an impression on me that morning . He was dressed in a tunic cut from some rare purple fabric threaded with gold . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he danced , and his turban was of pale blue silk , its free end flying out from his left shoulder . At this stage of the dance his extraordinary hair was held in place by the turban , but at his shoulders it was free to twist and move in the flickering lights . He was a young man of extreme physical beauty , and I was repelled by him for the reason that he knew he was beautiful and intended using this beauty to create confusion . The tempo of the music increased , but now the audience did not move and the solitary dancer began to shift his body and his feet more deftly . I noticed that he kept lagging behind the beat of the music , as if he were too languid to keep up , and this gave his dance a quality of sexual boredom and lethargy . Then the musicians began to shout and hammer their drums in planned frenzy , giving the impression that the boy was being driven to dance more rapidly , and as he did so the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color and a hypnotic gyration that I had to admit was thrilling . No woman in a steamy hall , loosening her garments one by one , ever generated more excitementthan this young man did in twirling away his blue turban until his furious black hair was free to whirl out in great circles parallel to the earth . He now intensified his rhythm until he was beating the earth like a drum , his head twisting in ecstasy . Dr. Stiglitz , who refused to acknowledge his spell , growled , " Probably his last year . "  | " He 's not twenty ! " I protested . " He could dance thirty more years . " " You forget . His job is n't dancing . He 's here to attract customersfor a troupe of nasty little boys . When they grow too old to attract these swine , " he said , indicating the silent , panting watchers , " they 're through , and that sweet little man playing the fiddle finds himself ten more teen-age mountain boys who enjoy sod-omy . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seeing , but such thoughts were banished when I looked across the stage to see in the front row the young man from Badakshar , who stood mesmerized , swaying back and forth in his tattered European coat . I tried to attract his attention , but he was enchanted and could not take his eyes from the young dancer , who now entered the final portion of his performance . Elbowing my way through the crowd to speak with the young mountaineer , I incurred bitter remarks from Afghans who were similarly bewitched by the exciting dancer , but I ignored them and came at last to the youth from Badakshar . " He 's good , eh ? " 1 asked in Pashto . He did not hear me . He was not aware that anyone had joined him , for he was captivated by the expert who now whirled about the stage in wide circles , his hair flashing in the night , his gold and purple costume rippling like crests of sand in a windswept desert . I poked the young mountaineer , and he blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if from a distance , and he mutteredweakly , " Without wings , he flies . " Having uttered this , he returned to his trance and watched as the dancer leaped and gyrated into a furious finale . Now even I had to pay attention , for 1 did not believe that a human body could move so fast and yet maintain control . The drums exploded and the flutes ran riot . There was a flash of hair and wild eyes and grinning mouth and golden cloth . The dance ended . At my side the young mountaineergasped and said , " In Badakshar we saw no dance like that . " I wished him good night , but I fear he heard no words.  |p123When  I awakened in the morning I saw Nur Muhammad perched on the spare tires , a mirror propped against a knee , a can of hot water at his side , shaving contentedly , for in the hotel at Kandahar there was no bathroom . After admiring his dexterity for some minutes I said in English , " That dancing boy we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The one who cursed you ? " Nur asked . " Stiglitz said they were all sodomites . " " They are , " Nur said methodically . " But the police watch them . " I pondered my next question for some time , then asked ,  |p124hesitantly  , in Pashto , " Nur , would you tell me what you know about Stiglitz ? " He continued shaving , inspected his chin as if today a good shave were important , then dried his face with ostentatious care . Apparently Nur had anticipated this question before we left Kabul and had consulted with government officials as to how he should answer . Carefully he replied , " We first heard of Otto Stiglitz in February of last year . That 's 1945 . Without any warning he crossed the border from Persia . Had no valid papers and was arrested in Herat . Never been to Kabul . He did carry with him papers that claimed a doctor 's degree in medicine from some Germanuniversity . " " His sign says Munich . " " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassadorin Paris to investigate the matter and he satisfied himself that Stiglitz was a legitimate doctor . His degree was authentic . As I recall , we received a copy of his university record . It was impressive . " " But it 's so difficult to get permission to enter Afghanistan , " I pointed out . Since we were speaking in Pashto I automatically used the standard pronunciation , as if the word contained no gh sound at all . To us who worked or lived in the country , it was Afanistan . " How could an ordinary man like Stiglitz just walk in ? " " You forget , " Nur pointed out . " He was n't an ordinary man . He was a doctor , and we need doctors . He was also a German , and we 've always needed Germans . Forgetting the unhappy experience with the bridges , our nation has been built by Germans . We 're sometimes called The Germany of Asia , ' and we 're not going to turn away German refugees now . " " You believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . . . legally ? " Nur asked quietly , as he began to pack away his shaving gear and offer me the hot water . " That 's all you know ? " I pressed . " Obviously , he came to Kandahar and opened shop as a doctor . Local people advise us he 's very good . At any rate , we 're glad to have him and I suppose he 'll stay here for many years . "  | " Why do you say that ? " " For most Germans , Afghanistan is the end of their road . From here there are few places they can go . " " Not even back to Germany ? " " There least of all . " " How many German nationals have you in the country ? " I asked , with a kind of morbid fascination , for although I was no professional German-hater I did have to acknowledge that had I been a citizen of that country in 1937 I would now be dead . And my relatives and many of my friends would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has always found joy in my association with relatives and friends , the thought of their being mutilated and starved and dead was not only morally repulsive . It scared the very devil out of me . Instinctively I feared Germans and always will . I do n't think this sprang from an unhealthy preoccupation with death . From early childhood I had been prepared by my parents to face the fact that people died , and I knew that one day I would ; but Jews have a love of continuity  --  which accounted lip part for the delight I took in the history of Afghanistan  --  and prior to World War II , whenever I thought of myself as dead , I thought of future Millers continuing . " There 'll always be some Miller who has tickets to Symphony Hall , " I assured myself , and if I were n't among them my absence would be regrettable but not tragic ; but if Millers and Goldbergs and Sharps and Weinsteins were not there  --  if all were gone  --  it would be unbearable . Had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and I could not ignore that fact . These personal reflections kept me from hearing all of Nur 's reply , but I did catch the figure of more than six hundred Germans reaching Afghanistan , some with exalted credentials . " All Nazis ? " " That 's a matter of definition . Many were decent men and women who hated Hitler and who had scars on their backs and minds to prove it . I talked about this with Moheb Khan . . . " Again I lost what he was saying , for his phrase " I talked about this with Moheb Khan " did n't jibe with my experience of the two men.  |p126Whenever  I had been with Moheb in the presence of Nur , the former had treated Nur like a servant . Apparently there was much I did n't comprehend about Afghan espionage and I supposed that some day I would find that Nur was Moheb Khan 's younger brother or nephew to the king . " If Stiglitz is so good , why does n't he come to Kabul ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to settle in different parts of the country . Where they 're needed . If he proves himself in Kandahar , he could be invited to Kabul . " " Then he 's not free to move around ? " " You are n't free to move around , " he pointed out . " You had to get permission from Shah Khan . " " I 'm an outsider . " " So 's Stiglitz . Until he proves himself . " " Is he doing so ? " " Yes . " Obviously , Nur wished to say no more on this subject . But I asked , " What 's the average Afghan pay for a visit to a doctor ? " " Possibly eight cents . " " So the refugees do n't get rich ? " " Not in Kandahar . " Again he ended the conversation , then added with cool calculation , " But if later on he could move to Kabul , then perhaps he 'd be able to serve the diplomatic community . Perhaps even officially . And for that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Stiglitz would consider coming to Kabul ? " Nur looked straight at me as he filled my shaving mug with hot water . " I should imagine that he dreams of nothing else . " " Could you give me an opinion as to how long his apprenticeship in Kandahar will be ? " " That will be decided by our government . . . and yours , if you should be thinking of employing Stiglitz as embassy doctor . " I made no comment . I was amused when Stiglitz and Nur met at lunch that day . The German was much more careful with Nur than he had beenp127with me , for he quickly guessed that Nur might be an official with some power in Kabul . " It 's a pleasure to meet Your Excellency , " Stiglitz said ingratiatingly . " I 'm not an excellency , sad to confess , " Nur parried . " I 'm Miller Sahib 's driver . " Stiglitz looked carefully at Nur 's western shoes , western suit and expensive karakul cap and decided not to fall into that trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest driversin Afghanistan . I wish I spoke English as well as you , Nur Sahib . " " I wish I were a doctor with a fine degree from Munich , " Nur replied , and the pudgy German radiated gratification . In succeeding days I saw a good deal of Stiglitz , and the more I saw the more assured I became that the embassies would be getting a good doctor if they got him , and I decided to help engineerhis promotion to Kabul . We often ate together , he jealously guarding his bottle of beer , I asking questions by the score , and he was willing to permit this because I paid for the meals . My questioning assured me of one thing : Stiglitz was no Nazi . He had a humanitarian attitude toward medicine and an understandingof what it could do to alleviate mental as well as physicalsuffering . He was hungry for philosophical discussion and each night dined with me on nan and pilau , then accompanied me to see the dances , after which we talked till midnight as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I recall those exciting days in Kandahar : his outspoken disgust over the dancing troupe and the lead dancer in particular . " They 're a blot on Afghanistan , " he railed , pronouncing the name of his new land like a native . " They represent a deep malaise . By God , they ought to get the women out of chaderi and put this country on a normal psychologicalbasis . " One day at lunch we were discussing this with Nur and he laughed tolerantly . " Every ferangi who comes here has some one thing that ought to be done right away . Dr. Stiglitz says , Get thep128women out of chaderi . ' The French ambassador says , Educate two thousand more medical men . ' The American ambassador tells us , Pipe water into the city from the hills . ' And the Russians say , Pave your streets . ' Do you know really what we must do first ? " " What ? " Stiglitz asked eagerly . This was the kind of conversation he liked . " All of them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to move the entire nation ahead on all possible fronts . And that requires more brains and more courage than we have available . Pray for us when you go to sleep . " " I 've been praying that you 'd take me to the house where Nazrullahlives when he 's in Kandahar , " I said . " I completed arrangements yesterday . " Nur bowed . " Will you join us , Doctor ? " " I would be honored , " he said formally . He was about to dig into his pocket for some change when a pleasant thought struck him . " Is the ferangi paying for this lunch ? " " I am , " I said . No refugees worried so constantly about money as the Germans . He sighed with relief when I produced the money , and I noticed that just before the bill was totaled he grabbed an extra piece of nan , which he munched as we hiked through the streets . Nur led us to the typical walled house , where the inevitable gate watcher inspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment contained no unusual feature : it had a garden , some fruit trees , mud walls , some Persian rugs , and a male servant . There was a big colored photograph of the king and on the table three very old copies of Time . The furniture was upholstered in a bilious pink mohair . Then something quite different happened . From one of the doors appeared an apparently young woman in a pale blue silk chaderi . Dr. Stiglitz showed amazement when he saw the shroud worn indoors , as did Nur Muhammad , who introduced me as the gentleman from the American embassy . In Pashto the shrouded figure said , " I am proud to welcome you to Nazrullah 's house . "  |p129Then  she whispered to Nur , who nodded assent , and she called for a male servant , who appeared with two children , a girl four years old and a boy only a few months old . " Nazrullah 's children , " Nur said approvingly . " The oldest is the age of my youngest . " " How many children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied . " Is your wife Afghan ? " " It 's none of your business , " Dr. Stiglitz snapped . " She 's from the north , " Nur said obligingly . It was obvious that we were speaking among ourselves because the presence of the woman in chaderi embarrassed us . Normally any Afghan man advanced enough to bring a ferangi into his home for presentation to his wife would tell her , " You can remove the chaderi , dear . " And Mrs. Nazrullah must have wanted to do so . But she was restrained by the fact that Nur Muhammad was an official of the government and might be a man committed to retainingthe chaderi . To protect her husband , she had to remain covered . Nur , on the other hand , was known to me positively as an enlightenedAfghan who wanted to see the chaderi go , and he was certainly inclined personally to say to Mrs. Nazrullah , " With us you can drop the chaderi , " but he was afraid that someone might report his action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government to establish his own rules . So two people who knew the chaderi was doomed were thus locked into positions where pragmatically they defended it . I broke the impasse by asking , in English , for I had no idea how a man addressed a woman whom he could n't see , " Why did n't Mrs. Nazrullahaccompany her husband to Qala Bist ? " " Ask her , " Nur said , so I restated my question in Pashto . " There were no quarters for us , " she replied softly . It was a curioussensation , hearing words issuing from a shroud . " I understand , " I said , but at the same time I remarked to my-. self : Ellen Jaspar found quarters.  | " Do be seated , gentlemen , " she said as the servant appeared with four glasses of orange drink . I wondered : How 's she going to drink with a chaderi on ? " We 'll be seeing your husband soon , " I said . " Can we take him anything ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected as embarrassment . Then she laughed charmingly , and I saw by the wall a box of things already waiting for us to take to Qala Bist . " Nur 's been here before me , " I said with what gallantry I could command . " Yes , " she said easily . " He arranged it yesterday , but I 'm pleased you have the same idea . I would n't want Nur to exceed his prerogatives . " Her use of words was so precise that I had to readjust my concept of the Nazrullah triangle . His Afghan wife was no barefoot desert girl hurriedly acquired to have babies which would extend the family line . " Can you speak other than Pashto ? " I inquired . " French . " Then slowly , and with pride , she added , " And a little English . " " Wisely so , " Stiglitz grunted . " Some day she 'll be an ambassador'swife . " Mrs. Nazrullah did n't hear this and Nur repeated the complimentin Pashto . The veiled figure laughed , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French ? " " Yes , " Stiglitz replied . " Do you , Miller Sahib ? " " Yes , madame , " I nodded . " Then why do n't we all use that language ? " she asked in good French . I looked at Nur , and Madame Nazrullah assured me , " Oh , Nur speaks better French than I. " I must have looked startled , for Nur explained , " Where do you suppose 1 worked before I worked with you ? French embassy . " I thought : When the Afghans get hold of a good man they see he gets a practical education . Dr. Stiglitz remarked , " You come back in three years , Herr Miller . Your man Nur will be speaking Russian . "  | " Well , " Madame Nazrullah said with that hands-folded , businesslikeway women can adopt , " I 've been told why you 're here , Miller Sahib , and I wish I could help you . But I have n't any idea where my husband 's other wife has gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think not , " she said . " And she 's not here ? " Madame Nazrullah laughed pleasantly . " No , we have n't had any ferangi wives walled up here in Kandahar for weeks and weeks . " " Forgive me , " I said . " But I suppose if you went back a few years , you might find an example or two . So your suspicions are excusable . " " Thank you . " " I do want to assure you of one thing , and please believe me as a friend who would do neither you nor Ellen harm . She never fought with me . I never humiliated her . During the short time we shared a house in Kabul we behaved like sisters . She used to sing to my daughter . " " Had she been warned  --  a second wife , I mean ? " " Of course ! " the shrouded figure laughed . " On the day we met she kissed me and said , You 're Karima . Nazrullah told me all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said flatly . " No American girl . . . " Nur interrupted . " Do n't speak like that , Miller Sahib . Is what Karima says any more difficult to believe than other things we already know to be true ? " " No . I apologize . " " I know how difficult it must be to understand my country , " Madame Nazrullah said softly . " But in your report cling to this fact , Miller Sahib . In Nazrullah 's home Ellen was treated with love and respect . She treated us in the same manner . " " Does that include Nazrullah 's mother . . . and sisters ? " " For two hours each afternoon Ellen took lessons in Pashto from Nazrullah 's mother . She was an adorable girl and our familyp32loved her . . . all of us . " She rose , bowed graciously and started to leave . Her orange drink remained untouched . " One more question , please , " I pleaded . " Have you any guess , no matter how bizarre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I will assure you of this . WhateverEllen did was an act of intelligence . She willed it to occur just as it did occur , for she was in possession of all her faculties and they were extraordinary . She was a brilliant , wonderful person , and if evil has come to her I am bereft , because there is one other thing you must know . " She hesitated and I believe she was crying , for she put her right hand to her mouth , or so I judged , for the chaderi masked her motions . " When Nazrullah brought her to Kandahar and left me behind in Kabul , it was Ellen who insisted that I rejoin them . When I arrived she met me and said , I was so homesick for the little girl . ' Between us , Miller Sahib , there was only love . " She left the room , then reconsidered and said from the door , " Possibly she asked me to come to Kandahar because she knew I could have children and apparently she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in the shroud , whatever her complexion or beauty , bowed and we saw her no more . When she had gone I said , " I expecteda barefoot nomad from the Hindu Kush . " " Her sister went to school in Bordeaux , " Nur observed . I turned to Stiglitz and said , " About the matter of having children . . . " In disgust Stiglitz barked something in German which I did not understand . He turned to leave the house , then snapped in Pashto , " Such matters are no concern of an embassy . " Abruptly he left us and stalked off , and I could see that he must have fled Germany for good reason . He was an honest , hard , opinionated man and for hint life under the Nazis must have been hell . Slyly Nur observed , " His way of confirming what Karima said . " " Think so ? " " Include it in your report , " Nur advised . " You wo n't be far wrong . "  |p133That  evening Nur and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pilau we wandered across the square to watch the dancers and I told Nur , " You could take this troupe to New York right now and they 'd be a sensation . " " Is that true ? " he asked skeptically . " Of course . That lead dancer could fit into any ensemble I ever saw . Do you realize how good he is ? " " Look ! " Nur chuckled during one of the intermissions . " OvercoatSahib . " And there was the young man from Badakshar , still stupefied by the dancer who " without wings , he flies . " My comment about the troupe saddened Nur , in a way I could not have predicted . " In many things we have great talent in Afghanistan . I 've heard old men in the hills who could tell long stories better than most of the European novels I read . You say the dancers are good . Do you realize how miserable it is to grow up in a country where there 's no outlet for talent ? " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " Is it true that in Russia they take dancing teams like this and sometimes give them medals and even send them to Paris ? " " Of course , " I replied . " All countries do . In the middle of the war I was in China , where they fought the Japanese all day and went to Chinese opera at night . The Chinese were no better dancersthan these men . " " Is that true ? " Nur mused . Again , the idea depressed him . But next morning we received another view of the dancing team , for while I was seated on the spare tires , shaving , I heard my name called in the courtyard . One of the armed guards who had been sleeping in our jeep was announcing that a visitor had come to see me , so I wrapped a towel around my neck and went to the slit window . The visitor was Dr. Stiglitz . " Let him in ! " I called in Pashto . In a moment the German doctor joined us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to see it . " " What 's up ? " " Did n't you hear the commotion . . . about four this morning ? "  | " Yes , " Nur replied . " Fighting in the streets . I put it down as a brawl . " " You were half right , " Stiglitz said . " It started as a brawl . " " What about ? " Nur asked . " The usual . Men got to fighting over the dancing boys . Particularlythe one Herr Miller admired . " " The one I said could succeed in New York , " I reminded Nur . " He succeeded last night , " Stiglitz said wryly . " Two men were fighting over him . It ended in murder . " Nur Muhammad swore in Pashto . " Another of those ? " " Yes , " Stiglitz replied in Pashto . " I warned our American friend that this boy was evil . . . evil . You never understood , did you , Herr Miller ? " " I did n't anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the terrifying incident in which we were to participate we continued to speak that language . Nur Muhammad must have guessed what we were about to witness , but I did n't , for nothing in my reading about Afghanistan , nor even the grisly events in Ghazni , had prepared me for the public square in Kandahar that lovely spring morning . Dr. Stiglitz , having witnessed such an event in Herat , knew what was afoot , and on our short walk to the square asked us to stop by his office , where the armed guard admitted us to a doubly locked trunk from which Stiglitz produced a Leica camera . Testing it by snapping Nur and me in his consulting room , he slung the camera over his shoulder and put on a karakul cap . Then he led us to the square . Where the dancers had performed the night before , a large group of men had gathered , but now the string of lights was gone and the hare earth glistened rock-like in the sun . To one side stood an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed not to be a distinguished citizen , for his sandals and shirt were tattered and his vest was nearly in shreds , but he commanded attention if only because of the noble manner in which he bore himself . He was surrounded by the mob , yet not a part of it , and all who came close to him offered deference , which he accepted as hereditaryp135right . He was obviously one of the causes why the mob had gathered . When the sun was well up , there was a beating of drums , not intended as the passionate accompaniment to dancing , for they were somber and of a different timbre , intended to announce the arrival of eight uniformed policemen , grim and forbidding in appearance . In pairs they marched to compass points previously marked by piles of pebbles , and then I saw that each pair had a mallet and a short stake , which was driven into the ground , leavingabout eight inches showing . The drums throbbed again , and from the alley that had been used as a dressing room appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite unlike the gaunt beak-nosed mullahs of the hills . They signaled the drums to cease , whereupon they prayed , first one , then the other . I did not catch all their words , but they seemed to be cleansing the minds of those who were about to participate in a time-honored rite . They also prayed that each of us , seeing this thing , would henceforth respect the commands of God and the precepts of His chosen Prophet . When their prayers ended , the drums beat again and a shackled man , obviously a prisoner , was led forth . " It 's the young man with the coat ! " I cried . Nur said , " From Badakshar ! " Then he cautioned me to remain silent , while Dr. Stiglitz busied himself taking photographs of the procession . The young man from the hills was in a daze . I doubt that he understood what was happening or had happened . He had come to Kandahar with a year 's savings and had been engulfed in a whirlpool beyond his comprehension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal . " Is he the murderer ? " I whispered to Nur . A man to the left explained , " Last night , when the dancing ended , the prisoner tried to buy the dancing boy . But a policeman had already spoken for him . The mountain boy refused to understand that the dancer could not be his . In a blind fury he killedp136the policeman . Everyone saw him do it . There 's no question of guilt . Only of punishment . " " What 's the punishment to be ? " I asked . " I wish you were n't going to see it , " Nur replied . " Are you staying ? " " What happens . . . I must report , " he said with resignation . The two mullahs went to the bedazed mountain man and said , " You have committed murder . " The prisoner was unable to acknowledge the charge . I did n't know what to expect next . The mullahs moved to a man whom I had not seen before , a fat fellow with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to assume control of this case ? " The fat official replied , " This is a crime of passion . The government is not concerned in any way with this case . " He nodded to the mullahs and departed . Next the mullahs moved to the elderly man in the badly torn vest and announced , " Gul Majid , this prisoner has murdered your son . By the law of the Prophet , he is handed to you for punishment . Do you , Gul Majid , accept this responsibility ? " The old man stepped forward with great dignity , raised his eyes so that they stared directly at the young man , and announced in a clear voice , " I accept the prisoner . " The mullahs said a final prayer , beseeching justice and mercy , and we saw them no more . The men who had been guarding the prisoner shoved him forwarduntil he was almost touching the old man , and it was now a matter solely between the young murderer and the elderly father of the murdered man , a morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored by them through countless generations . State and church alike had withdrawn . It was the guilty and the bereaved , standing face to face , and the crowd , which formed a significant part in this reenactment of the passion play , remained tense and silent until the old man cried in a loud voice , " Let the prisoner be tied ! " At this the crowd broke into a shout of wild approval , and I heard Nur whispering in Pashto , " I wish to God that just once therep137could be mercy . " On this day there was to be vengeance , not mercy . The young murderer was whisked to the stakes , stretched upon the ground face-up and lashed by ankles and wrists until he was spread-eagled in the manner of St. Andrew at his crucifixion . No further attempt was made to keep this a religious ceremony ; we were about to participate in retribution , sure and implacable . When the young man was securely tied , the guards who had done the job stepped away , to be replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . They stood at intervals about the prisoner , close enough together to prevent a riot but far enough apart to provide everyone with a clear view . The crowd grew silent and men elbowed their way forward to find good spots from which to view the spectacle . The father of the dead policeman now stepped forward and stood at the feet of the staked-out prisoner . He mumbled a short prayer , then shouted boldly , " Give me the scimitar . " I 'm not sure you would translate his word as scimitar , but at least it was n't the word for sword , and from his band of associates a man stepped forward with a rusty old nineteenth-century bayonet . In a clear voice the old man shouted , " My grandfather captured this from the British at the siege of Kandahar . " The crowd cheered . I looked down at the young man , who appeared not to comprehendwhat was happening , for his eyes were glassy and remained in the trance that he had entered at the time of the murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . But when the old man 's address to the public ended and he knelt beside the young man 's head , the prisoner at last saw the rusty bayonet and began to scream . It was a horrifying , animal scream that came from far back in the history of human development . It was , I thought , exactly the right kind of scream for such a scene , for it put us all solidly in the animal category . " No ! No ! " screamed the staked-out young man , but we had passed the time for words . The old man steadied himself , twisted his left hand in the victim'shair , and pulled his neck taut . With the rusty bayonet in hisp138right hand he began sawing at his prisoner 's throat , and with each awful passage of the bayonet , the boy 's head twisted back and forth , while terrible screams emanated from the throat which had not yet been severed . I thought I would vomit . Then , by the grace of God , a figure hurried out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity stopped . I breathed again . The intruder was Dr. Stiglitz , and he argued with the old man in Pashto , but the impassioned executioner failed to comprehend and looked at the German in bewilderment . Then I saw Stiglitz point to the camera and say in a clear voice which I and the others could hear , " If you work from the other side , the light will be better . " The old man shrugged his shoulders and Stiglitz asked harshly , " You want your picture taken , do n't you ? " At last the executioner understood , and I watched aghast as he switched his position and started cutting from the other side . The sun was unobstructed . With four powerful drags of the bayonet the old man slashed the victim 's throat and silenced the horrible cries . Then he continued bearing down until the cartilage and bone were severed , whereupon with some awkwardness and fatigue from his exertion he rose , keeping his left hand twisted in the victim 's hair , and marched triumphantly about the circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man came to me , I had to look away and found myself looking directly at the sodomite dancer whose alluring performancehad launched the tragedy . His face was enraptured as he followed the passage of the severed head . His clothes were as neat as ever and he smelled of perfume . When he caught me staring at him with loathing he flashed his most ingratiating smile and whispered in Pashto , " It was horrible , was n't it ? " " Herr Miller ! " I heard a voice calling . Dr. Stiglitz had seen the sybaritic dancer standing beside me and had come for a picture of us . He worked on the focus for a moment , while the dancer , accustomed to having his picture taken , assumed a dramatic pose and I looked astounded in my karakul cap . I still have the picture ,  |p239and  it serves to remind me that what I have described did happen . Nur and I walked silently across the square to the restaurant , but I was too shocked to want food . Before long the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll have a bottle of beer . Nur ca n't join me because he 's Muslim and you do n't like beer . " When another of the precious bottles was produced , Stiglitz observed , " I 'll have two good reasons to get to Kabul eventually . You do n't have these public executions up there , but you do have German beer . " " If the execution appalled you , " I asked weakly , " why did you photograph it so carefully ? " " I believe we should have a record , " he replied . " All historical processes should be recorded . In a few years what you saw today will vanish . Nur Muhammad will see to that . " " But when you stopped the old man . . . Surely , you could have prevailed upon him . " " Me ? " Stiglitz cried . " They 'd have killed me . " " They would have , " Nur agreed . " But to ask him to switch sides . God , it 's ghoulish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carefully prying the cap off his bottle of beer . I was choked with moral rage , and then I began laughing . Deep , gusty , cackling laughter overtook me , and although both Nur and Stiglitz tried to stop me , they could n't , for I was pointing across the restaurant to the public square , where the old man who had conducted the execution was marching home . In his right hand he held the historic bayonet which had avenged family dishonor , while in his left he held the hand of the sodomite dancer , who walked along bowing to the approval of the crowd . It was not this incongruous mating which had caused me to burst into uncontrolled laughter . At the scene of the execution the old man had discarded his sorely tattered vest and he was now wearing the dead man 's overcoat , that beautiful , torn and ravaged but still serviceable woman 's coat from Paris . It fitted his spare body well , and he actually looked dapper in his new garment . " Wait ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Doc/tor ! " I shouted . " Get a picture of this , too , " and I struck a pose between the unlikely pair . When I rejoined my table Nur Muhammad was so angry that he cast aside his role of polite government aide . " Why did you do that ? " he demanded bitterly . " It was so goddamned ridiculous , " I said , suddenly ashamed of myself . " You 're using Mr. Jaspar 's word , " Nur said acidly . " What 's that ? Who ? " Stiglitz asked , carefully putting away his camera . " A friend of Miller Sahib 's . Every time he confronts something he does n't understand he calls it ridiculous . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " Some years ago a Frenchman took a series of excellent photographs . . . in Alabama . . . of a lynching . Was that ridicu-lous ? " " I was laughing because my nerves were shot , " I explained lamely . " Good . I think that now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean by that ? " I asked angrily . " You 've seen the terror of my nation . Now let 's talk about Ellen Jaspar . " " I 'm willing , " I said in some bewilderment . " Let 's have no more diversions . No more amusing yourself with old men in public . " " I apologized , " I snapped . " Good , " Nur said grudgingly . " When you ridiculed the old fool and the evil young man I thought . . . " " I think it was the coat . . . It rounded out the story . " " I 've forgotten the incident , " Nur said . " Do n't you remember it as the way we live in Afghanistan . " " We can talk frankly , then ? " I asked . " You always could , with me , " Nur replied . " The other day when I spoke with Shah Khan he confided that he had heard rumors that something extremely bizarre had happenedp141to Ellen Jaspar . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even repeat the rumor . " " What rumor ? " Dr. Stiglitz interrupted . " The one I asked you about the first night . " " I told you . I have no speculation , " he growled , returning to his beer . " Have you ? " I asked Nur . " As I told you before , she 's run away and perished . " " You 're honestly convinced that she did n't die at the hands of fanatical mullahs ? " Nur was plainly irritated . " Miller Sahib , " he protested , " you asked me that last week in Ghazni , and I swore it could not have happened . Do n't you take my word for anything ? " " What we just saw , " I said quietly , pointing toward the headless corpse which would lie on the ground till sundown , " permits a man to check answers , does n't it ? " " Not when the answers have already been verified , " Nur replied . " But the mullahs ? " I repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be among the finest men in our priesthood . They were acting in strict accordance with Afghan custom , but they know public executions like this ca n't continue indefinitely . And when it comes time for men like you and me to end them , they 'll be on our side . " " They will ? " I asked incredulously . " Of course . I 've a brother who 's a mullah and a lot better citizen than I am . " " I 'd like to meet him , " I said brusquely . " When we get back to Kabul , you will . Miller , you miss the secret of Afghanistan if you think that Islam is a religion which condoneswhat you 've just seen . " " It 's a damned fine religion , " Dr. Stiglitz interrupted in Pashto , where the oath was more colorful . " Matter of fact , I became a Muslim last year . " " You did ? " I asked in undisguised surprise . " Why not ? This is my home from now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " You 've surrendered Christianity ? " I asked with an abhorrence which I did n't try to mask . " I repeat , " he began in Pashto . Then for some inexplicable reason he started speaking French . " I repeat , " he said in French , " why not ? A religion is not something eternal . It 's got to function in a given time in a given place . If it does n't function , it 's no good and you 'd better get another . Have you ever considered how your Christianity functioned in Germany ? The total perversion of societyit permitted ? The mass executions ? The horrible betrayal of humanity ? I swore when I reached Herat , If Christianity ca n't do any better than it did in Munich , I 'll take whatever religion they use here . It ca n't be worse . ' Actually , it works out rather well . " Nur added something that astounded me . " I suppose you know that Ellen Jaspar also became a Muslim ? " Before I could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about it the last time I saw her . She said she found great solace in her new faith . Called it a desert faith . ' When I asked her what she meant by that , she said that Christianity had become a convenient ritual for those who overeat on Saturday , commit adultery on Saturdaynight , and play golf on Sunday . " Ellen 's description , when delivered in French , sounded witty , ugly and profound . " She said she needed a religion much closer to original sources . One thing she said impressed me . She pointed out that Islam , Christianity and Judaism all started in the desert , where God seems closer , and life and death are more mysterious . She said that we are all essentiallydesert animals and that life is meant to be harsh . When we live in an oasis like Philadelphia or Munich we become degenerate and lose touch with our origins . " " Would you return to Munich . . . if you were free to do so ? " I asked . Dr. Stiglitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far said implied that he was barred from returning to Germany , but his self-committal to a new world permitted only one conclusion , and I had publicly stated it . He was angry with me for having done so and replied in German , " No , I would never return to Germany . " Then he translated into Pashto.  |p143At  this point the pilau was served , a rich , steaming dish with extra pine nuts and raisins , and although immediately after the beheading I had been repelled by the thought of food , with the passage of time I had grown hungry , and we three dug into it with our fingers , achieving a kind of hard brotherhood as we did . Dr. Stiglitz was then forty , Nur Muhammad was thirty-two and I twenty-six , but because each of us had a certain integrity which he was willing to protect , we were growing to respect one another , and I was happy to be with them . Indeed , I was proud to be with them , eating in communion after a ritual execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion of the desert , " Nur warned . " It has much vitality and the world has not yet heard the last of it . " I was driven to ask an impertinent question . " If a new state of Israel is fashioned out of the desert , will you Muslims be able to accept it ? " " You can trust the Jews to look after themselves , " Stiglitz said bluntly , and the brotherhood that had been burgeoning collapsed . I was shocked that a German refugee would make such a statementpublicly , but what followed shocked me even more : " And if they should need help , men like you and me would help them . They deserve a country of their own . " He returned to his beer . " The Muslims wo n't like it , " Nur reflected , " particularly the Arabs . I wo n't like it . I do n't want Jews taking part of my homeland . But the alternatives I like even less . We Muslims will give the Jews a little . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I remarked , " We have no proof at the embassy that Ellen Jaspar became a Muslim . " " Many ferangi wives do , " Nur replied . " We see no reason for official comment one way or the other . " " They do ? " I asked . " Of course . You Christians always think that conversion goes one way . Right here you see proof to the contrary . Dr. Stiglitz from Germany and Ellen Jaspar from Philadelphia . " I began to laugh again , this time nonhysterically . " What about that beer ? " I asked , pointing at the half-empty bottle.  | " A German can be many things , " Stiglitz explained robustly . " A Catholic , a Jew , a Lutheran , a Muslim . But always he 's a beer drinker . I have a dispensation from the mullah . . . the one you saw today . He 's an understanding liberal . "  |p145Two  substantial rivers ran through the part of Afghanistan in which I was traveling , the Helmand , which started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed down past Kandahar . It was at Qala Bist that they met to combine forces for a dash across the desert , and it was at this confluence , in the most ancient times , that a powerful civilization developed . From the way Shah Khan had described it , I would have wanted to see Qala Bist even had I not known that Nazrullah was working there and that Ellen Jaspar had vanished from that point . The ruins lay only seventy miles west of Kandahar , but sincep146many of those miles were across open desert , Nur Muhammad had our jeep packed before dawn and we drove out of Kandahar with the first rays of sun . We must have made an impressive one-jeep caravan , for we had now discarded western clothes and were dressed like desert Afghans , except that we kept our karakul caps . I was impressed by the road west , for it led through fruit groves and well-established farms , each protected by high mud walls with boxlikestructures at the corners . " What are the boxes for ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . " " I still do n't get the boxes . " " They 're for the lookouts , " he explained . " Growing melons in Afghanistan is extremely difficult . During the entire month they 're ripening the farmer has to station armed men at each field to shoot thieves . " I must have looked as if I thought he was teasing , for he added gravely , " My father raised melons , and at the age of nine I stood night watch with a shotgun . Otherwise every melon would have been stolen . " " Why do you permit such thievery ? " I asked . " We 're a brigand society , " Nur said . " Our king does n't rule in Kabul the way your president rules in Washington . In this countrywe murder kings . " We had now reached the village of Girishk , where we were to leave the pleasant melon patches and turn south across the desert . For me this was a rare moment , for we were about to enter upon the great world-desert that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Sahara and on to Morocco , where it is finally halted by the Atlantic Ocean . I had not previously seen this enormous desert , and now as the early sun showed me the windswept land and the burning rocks I knew I was entering a new world . This was the universe of shifting sand , the mournful camel chewing sideways , the men in dirty white . I remember with great clarity my first impression of this vast desert and my astonishment at its enormous vistas . The segment which we had struck was in some ways an idealp147introduction , for it was both smaller than the better-known deserts of Arabia , Egypt and Libya  --  less than two hundred miles on a side  --  and more savage . It had no oasis , no vegetation and no protectiverocks . It was a bleak , barren waste across which the wind howled perpetually , and to be lost on it meant death , a fact which was amply proved each year , and it was from this remorseless character that the Afghan desert had obtained its lurid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds so exhibitionistic : The Dasht-i-Margo , the Desert of Death . We had traversed the dangerous wastes for about two hours when we saw ahead a sight that I knew was coming but which nevertheless startled me . Rising from the desert , along the shores of the Helmand River , stood the arch of Qala Bist , an enormous clay-brick structure rising high in the air . A thousand years ago it had formed part of some Muslim edifice , but even the memory of the mosque was lost . Yet there the arch stood , so tall it seemed impossible that a desert people had built it . It was the more surprisingbecause it was an unsupported arch , a lofty , soaring flight of brick composed in beautiful proportions , and when we stopped the car to admire it I told Nur , " You had some architects in the old days . " " Wait till you see over there , " Nur laughed , and as we approached the suspended arch I began to see the outline of a great deserted city : walls that crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestic size , and battlements that once accommodatedthousands of soldiers . " What is it ? " I asked . " Nobody knows . " " You mean it 's just there ? " " It 's one of our smaller deserted cities , " Nur assured me . Pointingwestward across the desert he said , " On the other side , where the Helmand disappears , there 's an empty city seventy miles long . No one knows who built it , either , but there it is . " " What do you mean , where the Helmand disappears ? " " This river , " he said , indicating the powerful flow at our feet . " Out in the desert it just disappears . "  | " Into what ? " I asked . " Into air . The Desert of Death is so dry that the river runs into a lake that just dries up . " I looked at him suspiciously and realized he was not teasing , so I dropped the matter , but the city before me could not be casually dismissed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's always been here , " Nur laughed . " No name ? " " No . Qala Bist is our modern name for the arch . " " It 's a masterpiece . if we had something like this in America , we 'd make it a national park . " " You started about a thousand years too late to have something like this , " Nur laughed . " We do have some ideas , of course . Possibly it was the winter capital of Mahmud of Ghazni . He was rich enough to have built it . But I agree with the experts who argue that it must have been here for a long time before Mahmud 's day . " And that 's all that 's known ? " " You see what I see , " Nur replied defensively . " There was a great city in the desert , and now even its history is gone . " The idea tantalized me and I was about to say , I 'm going to find out what happened here , when I saw on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dressed in desert costume and turban . He was waving to us and Nur cried , " It 's Nazrullah , " and I saw that he wore a mustache and beard . On the city wall he made a fine figure and could have been a young captain of the guard a thousand years ago . " Eh , Nazrullah ! " Nur shouted . " I 've brought an American with me . . . from the embassy . " This news somewhat deflated the young man on the wall , for he ceased waving ; but then his pleasure at seeing visitors overcame any hesitancy , and he scrambleddown from the high wall and ran forward to greet us . " Nur Muhammad ! " he cried with real pleasure , and they embracedin a manner that satisfied me that my driver was no ordinaryAfghan . Nazrullah then turned to me and said in English ,  |p149smiling  warmly , " You are welcome to my humble abode , such as it is , four hundred rooms . " We laughed and Nur said in Pashto , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spy you out for the evil fellow you are . " It was apparent that Nur desperately wanted us to get along . Nazrullah extended his hand and said generously , " You 're most welcome ! Drive this way . We 've cut a breach in the wall and you can bring your jeep into the city . " And he led us to the opening . There he climbed in with us , for his camp site was far inside the walls  --  three-quarters of a mile , I judged  --  and as we traveled I tried to study both Nazrullah and his extraordinary city . He was an attractive fellow , not so tall as I but more wiry and better coordinated . He had a mercurial brilliance , in both gesture and speech . His hair was rather long , possibly because barbers were rare in Qala Bist , but he was extremely clean , even though he was living under unusual conditions . He seemed a well-organized man and I could understand the high regard in which Moheb Khan , Nur Muhammad and Dr. Stiglitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stout walls many feet thick and sometimes twenty feet high swept over rolling ground for some eight or nine miles , enclosing an area which once containedsubstantial farm lands , water systems and separate villages for menials . The brick city itself was a confusion of palaces , minarets , fortresses and what must have been administrative centers . I can best describe it this way : By the time I had seen one complete set of related buildings I thought : This is the city . But it was n't , for it was connected by ramparts and forts to a larger segment , and this was repeated six or seven times . After a considerable drive we reached a large field contained within the walls , and here Nazrullah had pitched his tents , from which he was conducting surveys of the area that was to be irrigatedby water taken from the Helmand River . He had at his disposal two jeeps , three engineers and four servants . No women were evident , but one tent , finer than the others , must have been the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months ago , and where possibly she still remained . I tried cautiously to study this tent without attracting attention , but I failed , for Nazrullah volunteered , " That 's where I live . Let 's unloadyour gear . " " Do n't let us inconvenience you , " I apologized . " You 're my first guests from Kabul , " he replied expansively . " Of course you 'll stay with me . " He threw back the flaps of his tent and bade us enter . I remember two things : the floor was covered by an expensive Persian rug , and on the desk stood a portrait of Ellen Jaspar dressed in the surplice she wore when singing Beethoven 's Ninth with the Philadelphia Orchestra . Nazrullah made no comment about the photograph . He indicated where we were to sleep and sent his servants to fetch our gear , which they unpacked for stowing in cardboard trunks which Nazrullah had acquired in the bazaar , but as they worked I saw in another corner a trunk made of leather , stamped with the initials E.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was empty or full , but it seemed to be waiting for its owner to return . Nazrullah now took us to a tent some distance from the others , and here , seated on rugs , we had our inevitable lunch of nan and pilau , but this was different , because near the tent the cook was operating an oven that must have been more than a thousand years old , and for the first time I saw how nan was baked . A conical mound of clay , looking exactly like a beehive with the top cut off , rose above a shallow pit in which charcoal was kept burning . The opening of the beehive gave access to the inner sides , which sloped over the coals , and it was against these sloping sides that the raw dough was fixed , though why it did not fall onto the coals I never understood . I asked Nazrullah and he said , " By trial and error the desert people developed this stove three or four thousand years ago . The dough is just sticky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough not to bake the bread too quickly . It 's obviously impossible , but it works . " The hot bread was delicious . After the meal , when our greasy fingers had been washed by servants , we returned to Nazrullah 's tent , where he said re/flectively , " It 's been my salvation , living here on the edge of the desert . After Germany and America , it 's reminded me of what Afghanistan is . Do you know what it is ? " he asked me directly . " Until I saw the Desert of Death I thought I knew . A mountainousland marked by inhabitable valleys and plateaus . " " Precisely . That 's what I thought it was . But four-fifths of our nation looks like what you see outside these walls . Desert , cut by rivers . And wherever we can lead those rivers onto the desert , we 're rewarded a thousandfold . Before you came here , Miller , did you realize that the Afghan is probably the world 's best irrigation expert ? " I said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop of water . The skill of our peasants is unbelievable . They take a little stream coming out of the mountains and lead it hundreds of yards to irrigate a field , then take it back to its main bed so that others can borrow it farther down the mountainside . One insignificantstream will be used many times . " " I 've never seen that , " I replied . " My job is to do on a grand scale with the Helmand what the farmers do so well with little streams . We 're going to build a giganticdam up in the hills and capture all the water you see going to waste out there . " The concept had inflamed his imagination , and with boundless vitality he rushed us out of the tent and over to the city , where we passed through silent streets that must once have been glorious with ribbons from India and furs from Russia . We climbed stairs that were almost as good now as when erected and came to a vast receptionhall , its walls still marked with murals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . Nazrullah moved quickly , for he was familiar with the ancient city , but I was tardy because I wanted to absorb the implied splendor of the place . It was incredible that men had ruled here whose dynastiescre forgotten , that a city of this magnitude could have perished ithout leaving in the records even the name by which its enemiesscribed it . As I caught up with Nazrullah on the battlement Iid , " Must give you an eerie feeling , living in a place like this . "  | " It does . No matter how indifferent you are to history , when you live here you speculate . " " Any conclusions ? " " None . I do n't have to solve the past . " He pointed down to the river that ran along the foot of the wall on which we stood . " My job is to get water out of that river . " " What 'll you do with it when you get it ? " He pointed beyond the river to the bleak desert , where wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to say that farther out lay an arable district . Instead he replied , " What looks like desert down there is potential farmland . Wherever we can lead the water , we can grow crops . When we 're through , this land will be as valuable as it was when this city supported perhaps half a million people . They lived by irrigation . " " You think so ? " " Look ! " he cried with infectious enthusiasm , and he intended that I look upstream where old embankments proved that the Helmand has once before been tapped for irrigation purposes , but I saw instead a curious procession of tall mounds that led away from our city toward a group of small mountains some twenty miles to the east . The mounds had obviously been made by man , because they appeared at regular quarter-mile intervals , and since each was of considerable size , and there were eighty or more visible , I was looking at a project of magnitude , whatever it was . " What are you staring at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I replied . Nazrullah thought for a moment , then banged his right fist enthusiasticallyinto his left palm and cried , " Miller , are you game for something exciting ? " " The ambassador told me to look around . " " You 'll be the only American who 's ever done this . " He ran to a point from which he could call to Nur Muhammad : " Nur , you want to go with us through the karez ? " He pronounced the strange word in one syllable to rhyme with breeze , and it had an instant effect upon Nur.  | " Not me ! And if Miller Sahib has any sense , he wo n't go either . " " He 's already volunteered , " Nazrullah shouted enthusiastically , " and if he goes , you 'll be shamed . " " I stand before my ancestors shamed , " Nur laughed . " You upholdthe honor of Afghanistan . I 'm a coward . " We hurried through the deserted city and climbed into one of Nazrullah 's jeeps , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon we were pulled up beside one of the mounds , which was built of mud brick rising to a height of fifteen feet or more . A crude ladder led to the top . When we had climbed it , I saw inside another ladder , much longer than the first , leading down to darkness . Nazrullah dropped a pebble , which splashed in water , far below us , and I realized that we were perched atop a shaft which led to an underground stream . " Down we go ! " Nazrullah cried like a college boy , and I watched his excited face , its beard covered with dust , disappear . I followed , and when I reached bottom found myself standing on a narrow edge of earth bordering a clear stream of water only faintly illuminated by sunlight seeping down the shaft . " Is each of the mounds like this ? " I asked . " Yep , " Nazrullah replied , proud of his American colloquialism . " It 's an underground irrigation system bringing water down from the hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He must have seen my apprehension , for he flashed on a light and added , " We 've cleaned it out for just such expeditions . " I looked at the low ceiling of the tunnel and discovered that once we left the mound , which permitted us to stand , we would be walking in very stooped positions  --  duck-walking , we had called it as children  --  and I was n't sure my legs would take it . " You wo n't feel it . . . in a quarter of a mile , " Nazrullah assured me . " Here we go , " I cried , more bravely than I felt , and bent over to creep duck-wise into the tunnel . My back quickly began to ache and , as I feared , my leg musclesp154became numb , but lithe Nazrullah was pushing ahead with such enthusiasm that I had to follow . At midpoint we could begin to see slight indications of light from the next mound and this encouraged me to bear my pain ; it also permitted me to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way and was held in place merely by the cohesion of clay , and whenever I bumped it with my head , bits of earth splashed into the water . I thought : This thing could collapse at any moment , and I began to feel my throat constricting . Fortunately , we reached the next mound and I was able to stand erect . My feet were soaking wet and my back creaked as I stretched it , but I was too stiff to want to climb the ladder immediately , so we stood in the small shaft of light and breathed the cool air . " Now you undersand why Nur refused the invitation , " Nazrullahlaughed . " I 'm glad I came . Who invented the idea ? " " Maybe the Persians . More likely the Afghans . It 's the best way known to transport water across a desert . If we tried to do it on the surface , the sun would evaporate it all . " " How old is the tunnel ? " " Assuming that it was used by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're standing in could have been dug twelve or thirteen hundred years ago . " " Let 's get out of here ! " I cried . " Of course , it 's been redug many times . The tunnels do collapse , " he said brightly . " I wondered about that as we were crawling through , " I replied . Nazrullah held the ladder by one hand and said , " The karcz system was very costly of human life . Water experts would go to the mountains and dig at likely points . . . sometimes seventy feet down , but because they were experts they usually found water . They would then calculate where that particular level would work itself to the surface , and they would dig these underground tunnels for ten to twenty miles , following the natural line of the water 's flow . "  | " Why did n't the ceilings fall in ? " I asked . " They did , frequently . The one we crawled under could collapse at any moment , " he said without emotion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special caste . They lived under special laws , ate special food , had extra women . Mullahs and policewere powerless to molest them , for generally they lived short lives and when they died , usually of suffocation , for they never shored up the ceilings and trusted to luck , their few possessions and their women were passed along to the next karez man . " I was beginning to feel the approach of claustrophobia and started up the ladder , increasing my speed when I saw how fragile the clay bricks were under which we had been standing . When I regained freedom I gasped deeply , then saw Nazrullah smiling , his beard gray with dust . " Lucky I did n't tell you that when we were halfway through , " he apologized . " That tunnel is going to fall on me every time I go to sleep for the next month . " I laughed thinly . " I 've thought of that myself , " Nazrullah confided . " After a seriesof collapses they often had to beat the men with whips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system the kings ordained that any boy born to a karez man had to inherit the job . I n some districts they were branded at birth . " " You live in a rugged land , " I remarked , shivering in the hot sun . Nazrullah climbed down the outside ladder and sat with me in the shadow of the mound . " It is a cruel land , " he admitted . " The existence of this karez reminds us how cruel . But even today in Afghanistan I could show you things that would shock you . " " I 've seen some of them , " I assured him . " What ? " he asked suspiciously . " In Ghazni . . . a woman stoned to death . In Kandahar a young man committed murder over a dancing boy . They cut off his head . . . with a rusty bayonet . " " You 've been initiated , " Nazrullah said without inflection . He termed wholly composed , but his inner tension was betrayed by quick gestures and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the karez occasionally so that I may remember the heritage of human suffering we 're trying to eradicate . If I 'd known you 'd seen the executions I would n't have dragged you into the tunnel , but I find I ca n't talk with ferangi who have n't had some similar experience . " " I 've had three now , " I said . " We can talk . " " I think we can , " he agreed , " and I 'd like to say two things , . It will require some words , but like your journey through the karez , it may be worth it . " I went to Germany at the age of twenty . Before that I 'd been educated by private tutors whose main job , it seems to me now , was to impress me with the moral depravity of Afghanistan and the timeless glory of Europe . I knew no better than to accept their indoctrinationat face value and reported to Germany fully prepared to exhibit my tutors ' prejudices . But when I reached GottingenI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone women in Ghazni  --  and we have some real primitives in this country  --  but the Germans . From 1938 through 1941 I remainedas their guest , to witness the dreadful degeneration of a culture which might once have been what my tutors claimed but was now a garish travesty . Believe me , Miller , I learned more in Germanythan you 'll ever learn in Afghanistan . " As you know , I went from Germany to Philadelphia , where half the people thought I was a Negro . What I did n't learn in Germany , you taught me . Why do you suppose I wear this beard ? Before I grew it I made a six-week experiment . I decided to be a Negro . . . lived in Negro hotels , ate in their restaurants , read their papers and dated Negro girls . It was an ugly , ugly life , being a Negro in your country . . . maybe not so bad as being a Jew in Germany , but a lot worse than being an Afghan in Ghazni . To prove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard and wore a turban , which I had never worn at home . " My education was worth every penny my government paid for it , because after six years in Gottingen and Philadelphia I positively hungered to get home and go to work . Miller , we can build herep157just as good a society as the Germans or the Americans have built in their surroundings . " I looked at his surroundings : a bleak desert , a muddy river , blazing empty hills , an abandoned city . Because I had seen Afghanistan , I appreciated the Herculean task he had set himself . " The second thing I want to say is this , " he continued with fervor . " Having made my transition from a boy who wanted to escape Afghanistan to a man who fought to get back , I find daily joy in being here . Imagine , at twenty-eight I can be appointed head of a project that will revolutionize this part of Asia . In Philadelphia a man at a cocktail party offered me the stirring job of helping to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women will go for that beard . ' Miller , I 'm here in the desert because I want to be here . I want to stir the earth like the karez men stirred theirs . . . fundamentally . . in the bowels . . . at the bottom of the ladderin a deep hole . And if the ceiling collapses on me , I do n't give a damn . " There was another moment of tension , then he laughed and said , " We 'd better drive back , " but when we tried to enter the jeep , the metal was so hot we could not touch it , for we were really in the desert , and if the ancient karez men had not dug their perilous tunnels , water could never have crossed this land and the city could not have existed . In the days that followed , Nazrullah talked eagerly about all aspects of life in Afghanistan , but whenever I broached the subject of his wife , he was adept in putting me off . Ellen was not at Gala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Nazrullah did not respond to my overtures on the subject , he did take every opportunity to let me see the kind of man he was , and as I watched him with the engineersand the workers I knew that I was observing a man who had matured far beyond his years . He had an enviable capacity to elicit from others their best cfTorts . I understood why the shoe company in Philadelphia had wanted to hire him and why a German engineering firm , looking to the future , had recently written to ask if he would represent themp158in Asia . He had a quick smile , an infectious wit and a generosity of spirit that was engaging , and I could now understand his effect upon a junior at Bryn Mawr , bored by her native surroundings . It was reasonable that Ellen Jaspar had fallen in love with him , but it was not reasonable that she should now , because of him , be in serious trouble , if indeed she were alive . In a way , I was sorry that I had interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silken , shrouded voice had not convincedme that she and Ellen had been friends , it would now be easy to conclude that only the shock of discovering a previous marriagehad unnerved Ellen . But if relationships were as placid as reported , and if Nazrullah were as congenial as he seemed , what dark force operating on this trio could have occasioned tragedy ? It was also interesting for me to compare Nazrullah with Nur . The former had been set free psychologically by his travels abroad , while Nur was still uncertain of himself , because of an insular limitation which he was working desperately to correct . Nazrullah utilized a broad , frontal approach to problems and for an Afghanwas markedly outspoken , partly because he was honest and partly because he lacked the ability to maneuver , whereas Nur was a master of manipulation . The big difference , however , lay in their concept of what process would lead to their country 's salvation . Nur , the traditionalist , whose brother was an enlightenedmullah , felt that Afghanistan would be saved through the rededicationof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our long talks in the tent , argued that what happened to the Muslim religion was no great concern of his . From having studied various religions at first hand , he suspected that any of the three great desert religions , Islam , Christianity or Judaism , was as good as any other but that Islam was rather better fitted for the social structure of Afghanistan . " But what 's going to save this nation is the creation of a contemporary world  --  a new economicsystem , a real representative form of government , dams , roads , farms . . . the things that we can create . " As he said this he snapped his fingers and cried , " Miller , to showp159you what I mean , I 'm going to take you to the site of the new dam . How soon can you start ? " Nur protested that the location was too far away , but Nazrullah would not listen . " You 've got to go there anyway . Saddle up the jeeps ! " He dashed about camp and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to see the future of Afghanistan ! " he promised . We roared out of the old walls in a caravan of three jeeps becauseNazrullah felt that any penetration of the desert in machines was so inherently perilous that group protection was advisable , but on this day nothing happened . We reached the junction town of Girishk , from which we struck off across forbidding land on a trail that jeeps could barely negotiate . Finally we ground to a halt at a goat trail , where we leia he jeeps under guard while we climbed on foot to a high elevation , from which we could see , far below us , the roaring Helmand River as it carried the spring thaw through a narrow cleft in the mountains . " To build a dam , a great dam such as the American and Germanexperts advise , " Nazrullah cried , pointing with a stick , " requirestwo things , a gorge and a mountain close by . Down there you see the gorge , with steep , solid walls , and over there you see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship ? " Nur asked . " You build a road from the mountain to the gorge . Then you lead that road over a temporary bridge that crosses the gorge , high up in the air . Then you dynamite the mountain rock by rock and haul it in trucks to the bridge , where you drop the rocks into the river . And after you do this day and night for three or four years , you have a dam . " He showed us where the road would be built and where the bridge would be slung , high above the rapids . " For seven months trucks will dump rocks off that bridge and nothing will happen , because the river will wash our boulders downstream as if they were straw . But one day the rocks will begin to hold , and the river will start to back up  --  just a little . But on that day we have it strangled . Then we can do with it what we will . "  |p160He  called for his field glasses , which enabled me to see bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dam would be and other marks south , many feet above the present water level . " Any idea what that 's to be ? " he asked , and when I admitted my ignorance he replied , " That 's the tunnel . While we 're throwing in the rock , we 're also digging that tunnel , and when the river starts to back up , it gradually rises to that level , and runs away through the tunnel . Then we move in hundreds of trucks and throw thousands of tons of rock into the ravine , pack them with earth and after some years concrete the exposed face and find ourselves with a dam . " It was difficult to visualize the completed dam , it was of such magnitude , but Nazrullah had surveyed the ground so often that to him the gigantic structure already existed . Pointing to a mark hundreds of feet above the river he said , " The water will rise to there . We 'll collect the floods in the spring , when they are n't needed in the fields , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the beauty of this system is that every pound of water that drops through our tunnel will generate electricity which we 'll send over the mountains to Kandahar . " Remembering that primitive city I predicted , " In Kandahar they wo n't be using much electricity . " " Ah ! That 's where you 're wrong ! " Nazrullah cried . " In Germany we made a study of fifteen primitive societies "  --  I liked his using the word primitive ; our ambassador had forbidden us to do so , claiming it insulted the Afghans  --  " and we found that when irrigationdams were built in primitive areas , the financial experts always fought against wasting the money to add generators at the same time . They argued , The people are so primitive they 'll have no use for electricity . ' In every instance , within five years the originaloutput of electricity , which the experts had called wasteful , was being utilized and further capacity was required . If we can get electricity to Kandahar , they 'll find ways of using it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so new to me that I asked for an illustration of a primitive society where this had happened . " I 'll give you ap161classic , " he said instantly . " The Tennessee Valley Authority . " " I 'd hardly call Tennessee primitive , " I argued with some asperity . " I would , " he replied flatly . " The hill region anyway . I made a study of it , on the spot , and in its way , compared to New York , it 's as primitive as Girishk compared to Kabul . And the T.V.A. found it could n't make electricity fast enough . " I was not satisfied with his description of part of my country as primitive , having always reserved that word for other nations , but I was impressed by his excitement about his job and the poetic insights he brought to it . For example , he stared down at the river which now ran wild through the gorge and said softly , " Is n't it a gripping idea , Miller , that on the day we drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have no idea of what 's happening ? Rocks like that have been falling off the cliffs for a million years , and it 's washed them aside . But these rocks will be different . They 'll be the beginning of something not even that river is strong enough to halt . And we will continue . . . " He hammered the air with his fist , visualizing the enormous aggregation of rock that would ultimately jam that gorge and tame the river . He turned to Nur and me with dancing eyes . " Each day we must throw similar rocks into the human river of Afghanistan . Here a school , there a road , down in the gorge a dam . So far our human river is n't aware that it 's been touched . But we shall never halt until we 've modified it completely . " As I looked down at the turbulent Helmand , rushing freely between the cliffs , it seemed to symbolize the wild freedom of Afghanistan , and I said half to myself , " It 's rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nazrullah grabbed me by the arm and whipped me about . " What did you say ? " he demanded . " I said , It 's a shame such a river has to be dammed . " - " That 's incredible , " he muttered , not in surprise or anger or any other emotion that I could recognize . " That 's really incredible , Miller . " He snapped his fingers , tugged at his beard and stared at me as if trying to reassemble fragments . " Those are the exactp162words Ellen said while standing here . " He bit his forefinger , then added with impatience , " You damned Americans are so sentimental . You 've organized your own land to the limit , but you criticize others who want to organize theirs . " " I was speaking symbolically , " I protested . " So was Ellen , " he snapped . " What you both meant was , The more modern Tennessee becomes , the nicer it would be to keep Afghanistan a primitive place where we could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to change it . . . profoundly . " " I want you to . Perhaps Ellen meant that old-fashioned ways are always better . A lot of Americans believe that nonsense . But I do n't . " " What do you believe ? " " That it 's always sad to see freedom lost . As for change , that 's why we have an American embassy in Kabul . To help you make the changes , yet stay free . " " You 'd better help , " he warned . " Because if you try to hold us back , Russia will be eager to jump in and help us . " " To what ? " I asked , but he had turned away and now stamped angrily down the mountain trail . When he reached the jeeps he jumped into one and roared down the dangerous trail to Girishk , leaving Nur and me to ride with an assistant engineer , who drove us back to Gala Bist . But often as our jeeps passed and repassed on the desert I caught sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left fist pressed against his bearded chin.  |p163Our  caravan had barely come in sight of Qala Bist when we spotted a strange jeep speeding at us from the walled city , throwing a cloud of dust across the desert . It was Dr. Stiglitz , driven by an Afghan military officer , coming out to intercept us as quickly as possible . " Where 's Nazrullah ? " the German shouted as he drew close . " He 's back there , " I cried . The four jeeps drew together in the desert and Stiglitz said in German , " I bring you bad news . " He and Nazrullah continued talking in German , but I caught the fact that something had happened to the American engineer Pritch/ard , who had crossed the Desert of Death some months before to measure the spring flow of the Helmand River . I waited impatiently while the two discussed the problem , and finally they took cognizanceof me . " Sorry , Herr Miller . My visit really concerns you . " " How ? " " There 's an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to the Afghan officer , who handed me a paper containing directionswhich the American embassy had phoned down to Kandaharmilitary headquarters that morning . It said : Miller . Proceed immediately to The City , thence to Chahar , where Pritchard broke his leg three weeks ago . See if the German Dr. Stiglitz can accompany you at our expense , but travel in at least two jeeps because earlier investigators dispatched by the Afghan government have not been heard from . Obtain fullest local advice before attempting journey . It was signed by Verbruggen and I could imagine his rough , worried voice on the telephone . I asked Stiglitz , " You know what 's in the message ? " " Of course . " " You 'll go ? " " I 'm here . " " How much ? " Before he could reply I led him away from the others , where he stood silent for some moments . I was certain he had guessed why I had called on him in Kandahar and I knew he wanted me to carry back a good report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he would be disposed to request a low fee in hopes of winning my favor ; on the other hand he was a trained doctor and proud of his German degree , in addition to which the cost of German beer in Kandahar was not trivial , so that he had reasons for asking a substantial fee . It was a delicate problem , and the poor pudgy man was not equal to solving it . I grew ashamed of myself , especially since I was a Jew and he a German . " I 'm sorry , Doctor , " I said . " I should 've spoken first . Two hundreddollars plus twenty dollars for each day beyond five that we 're out . " Stiglitz breathed deeply , and I judged that my offer was morep165generous than he had dared to demand . " I accept ! " he said , continuingwith profuse thanks which became almost embarrassing . " You 've no idea , Herr Miller , how those damned Afghans rob me for my beer . " " Agreed . " Then I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He is not ! " Nazrullah protested . " I am . " He drew his staff about him and shot a series of questions : " What 's the state of the moon ? " " Which of our jeeps is in best condition ? " " Miller , will you turn over your K-rations to us ? " " Water , crowbars , tow ropes ? " When he had satisfactory answers he looked at his watch and said , " We 'll leave Qala Bist in forty minutes , . We 're taking Miller 's jeep and mine . Nur Muhammad to drive one . I 'll drive the other . Stiglitz and Miller the only passengers . I want everything assembled in front of my tent at once . O.K. ? " He jumped in his jeep and sped for Qala Bist , leading us through the ponderous wall and across the fields to the camp . As he ran for his tent he shouted , " Nur , stay with me , " and in the next minutes I watched two Afghan gentlemen assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything went wrong . Nur , who understood jeeps , took care of matters in that area , while Nazrullah checked the logistics , then supervised the packing . " Turbans for the ferangi ! " Nazrullah shouted , and one of the engineers solved this by lifting two from the heads of the servants . " You 'll need it , " Nur assured me as I packed mine . It was still several hours before dark when we approached our loaded jeeps , where Nazrullah consulted for the last time with his staff and with the Afghan officer . Taking a map he drew a tentative line from Qala Bist across the desert to an extended area marked simply The City . There he turned his line south until it reached the remote village of Chahar . " We 'll be going this way , " he announced in Pashto , " and if anything should happen , I promise I wo n't be far off this route . " He watched while Nur and the officer traced the route on their maps . " Now , " Nazrullah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be ? "  |p166He  stared at his staff , at Nur , at the officer . The latter spoke : " Ten days ago we sent two men in a jeep . . . " " One jeep ? " Nazrullah asked , tugging his beard . " Yes . " " Great Jesus Christ ! " Nazrullah snapped , uttering an oath quite inappropriate for a Muslim , something he had picked up at the Wharton School . " One jeep ? " He stabbed at the map . " Driving across that ? " " Yes , " the officer replied , unruffled . " They left Kandahar ten days ago , drove to Girishk , and started across the desert on this course . " On Nazrullah 's map he drew a firm line which converged on our projected course about halfway across the desert . Nazrullah reflected and said , " With the lines running that way we might spot them anywhere during the second half . " I added , " If they 're broken down , they 'll probably have a flag waving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassion , then asked , " Did they know the desert ? " " Yes . " " They the type who follow instructions ? " " Best men we had . " Nazrullah studied the map for some minutes . " I want you to change my route just a little . We 'll drop up here and take a look . " He drew a jog to the north , almost off the desert , and said , " We 'll never be far from this route . Salaam aleikum . " With that he spun his wheels in a tight circle and sped for the wall . In a few moments we were entering the desert , headed west for the setting sun , a simplecaravan of two jeeps , each marked by high poles from which fluttered large squares of white cloth . The Afghan Dasht-i-Margo was not a desert in the accustomed sense , for although it did contain vast unbroken stretches of sand , it was also an accumulation of shaly detritus laid down by deterioratingmountains which had eroded through millions of years , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes half a mile wide along which our jeeps could race at forty miles an hour ,  |p167while  we saw on either side the glorious sweep of traditional dunes that characterize the usual desert . An additional feature marked this desert : When we were well into its heart we could not see a single thing growing nor any shred of human existence . There were no lichens on the rock , no seedlingsin crevices , no shrubs , no birds , no gullies touched with a little water , no lizards , no eagles , no oases of any kind . There were no fence poles nor relics of forgotten homes nor even stones laid in a row . There was only the most blazing , heat-racked emptiness I had ever seen . I remember thinking once , when we were surrounded by dunes : In the polar regions they at least have frozen water and insects . Here there 's nothing . . . except heat . " How hot is it ? " I asked Nur . " Hundred and thirty , but it is n't the thermometer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolate landscape . " It 's the wind . " He checked some drifting sand and said , " Wind 's thirty miles an hour . Later it 'll grow to fifty . That 's what kills you on the desert . " I now began to appreciate the flags that Nazrullah had provided for our jeeps , for as our caravan moved across the desert we were frequently separated , since neither driver could be sure that what looked like a potential road would turn out to be so ; and often it was the driver in second position who found the successful trail , whereas what had looked good to the first man had turned into a wall of impenetrable sand . When this happened , the unsuccessful driver would whirl about , look for his companion 's flag , and set off in hot pursuit . Neither waited for the other , but each felt responsiblefor seeing that the separation did not become too great . " Is it possible to work your way into a real dead end ? " I asked . " Sure . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need that other flag ! ' We had been on the road for well over an hour when Nazrullah , whose jeep was now in the lead , stopped abruptly and waited for us to join him . He signaled for silence , then pointed to a small herd of gazelles  --  not more than fifteen  --  that had penetrated these dreadfulwastes where I had been unable to see a shred of forage butp168where they were acquainted with hidden areas that no man had yet identified . At first I did n't understand why the gazelles fascinated me , but I sat spellbound watching the small , delicate animals standing gracefullyon the face of the burning desert . What could they be doing ? What did they signify ? Afghanistan had untold valleys where an animal could find forage . Why were they here ? And why was I so moved by seeing them ? One of their lookouts spotted us , and with a disembodied grace the small animals leaped , exploded in the dying sunlight , twisted , turned and fled like wraiths across the desert . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sped away like the sound of retreating music , one female , small and without horns , ran toward us with a breathless poetry , then saw the jeeps and turned in midair , throwing her sharp hoofs to one side as she changed direction . As she did this marvelous thing , I was forced to cry out , for I saw that she was colored like the chaderi Moheb Khan 's niece had worn , and she was not an animal at all , she was not a gazelle , but the embodiment of the hunger I felt . In this cruel land of recurring ugliness , where only men were seen , the gazelle reminded me of womanliness , of girls at a dance , of the mystery of half the world , . I watched her go in matchless grace , darting this way and that until she vanished behind a distant dune , and there were tears in my eyes and I felt I could not tolerate the awful loneliness of the desert . I was lost in Asia . I was forsaken on the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighing , drifting premonition . Then I heard Nazrullah saying , " They must have come down from the caravanserai , " and we took out our maps to discover that we were near the jog that Nazrullah had drawn to the north . " There 's a chance the other two might have made for the caravanserai . " And we turned north . The sun was just setting when we reached the top of a dune from which we could look down upon one of the sights that has always inspired the traveler in Asia : a walled caravanserai looming out of the dusk at the end of a long journey . It remains unforgettable : a gaunt , square , mud-walled sanctuary built around a central openp169space where animals of the caravan were sheltered . One leg of the wall comprised a fort devoid of windows but well supplied in recent centuries with slit holes for rifle fire . Entrance was by a solitarygate , a handsome structure built in fine Arabic proportions . The serai had been erected hundreds of years ago , possibly even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously , for it stood at the edge of the desert near the end of a little gully in which grass grew and stagnant water accumulated , and to it had come , as we now came , thousands of caravans needing protection for the night . It was a rule of the desert that whoever succeeded in entering a serai was safe for the night , no matter what antagonist he encountered inside , and there must have been many stirring tales of blood enemies who shared sanctuary here under unexpected circumstances . As we approached the gate , Nazrullah halted the jeeps and he and Nur debarked to study , on hands and knees , all the surroundingsand , entering the walls to continue their search . After a while they reappeared and said , " They did n't get this far . " I hoped that this was a sign that we were to move on , for whereas I had found the ruins at Qala Bist so immense as to be commanding , I found this old deserted caravanserai a place of brooding quiet that was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gazelles , possibly by the haunting loneliness of a desert twilight , but the idea that a wayside inn had once flourished here but had now lost its reason for being was at the moment too gloomy for my acceptance . " Are we leaving ? " I asked hopefully . " We 'll eat here , " Nazrullah replied , and he took us to the fort , where he and the doctor began laying out blankets on the earthen floor , . Nur lit two Coleman lamps , whose incandescent glow showed the high roof of the caravanserai to good effect , and if anything were calculated to make me feel gloomier than I already did , it was the way the flickering light threw enormous shadows on the mud walls . I thought : Genghis Khan could come through that door , and he 'd be right at home . Two-thirds of the way down the hall , a stout circular columnp170about twelve feet in diameter rose from the floor and continued through the roof . It was built neither of wood nor of mud but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exciting patterns . " That 's a beautiful column , " I remarked . " What 's it used for ? " " Famous , too , " Nazrullah replied without looking . " What for ? " " Manner of construction , " he replied . " What 's unusual , the plaster ? " " The insides . " Dr. Stiglitz interrupted . " What 's inside ? " he asked , and years later when I reconstructed that night I became convinced that somehowhe knew what the answer was going to be . " It 's not pleasant , " Nazrullah cautioned . " Want to hear it before dinner ? " When I said yes , he continued , " Some time around 1220 , Genghis Khan . . . " " I just thought of him ! " I cried . " How so ? " Nur asked . " I was looking at those shadows and thought , If Genghis Khan came in now , I would n't be surprised . " " He was here , " Nazrullah laughed . " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed Afghanistan . In one assault on The City he killed nearly a million people . That 's not a poetic figure . It 's fact . In Kandahar the slaughter was enormous . Some refugees fled to this caravanserai . . . this room . They were sure the Mongols would n't find them here , but they did . " His voice resumed its flatness . " And the pillar ? " Stiglitz pressed . " First Genghis erected a pole right through the roof . Then the Mongols took their prisoners and tied their hands . Laid the first batch on the floor over there and lashed their feet to the pole . All around . That 's why the pillar is twelve feet across . " " Then what ? " Stiglitz asked , perspiration standing on his forehead.  | " They just kept on laying the prisoners down , one layer on top of the other until they reached the roof . They did n't kill a single personthat day , the Mongols , but they kept soldiers stationed with sticks to push back the tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still living  --  those that had n't been pressed to death  --  they called in masons to plaster over the whole affair . If you 'd scrape away the plaster you 'd find skulls . But the governmenttakes a dim view of scraping . It 's a kind of national monument . The Caravanserai of the Tongues . " No one spoke . The meal was ready but no one seemed hungry , so finally Nazrullah said , " I tell you these things only to explain the terrible burdens under which Afghanistan has labored . Our major cities have been destroyed so many times . Do you know what I expect . . . seriously ? When a thousand men like me have rebuilt Kabul and made it as great as The City once was , either the Russiansor the Americans will come with their airplanes and bomb it to rubble . " " Wait a minute ! " I protested . " I 'm not speaking against Americans . , . . or Russians . You wo n't destroy us in anger . Genghis Khan was n't angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamerlane or Nadir Shah or Baber . And I 'm not downcast because we 're doomed to be destroyedagain . " He shrugged his shoulders . " It 's inevitable . We go on building while we can . " He laughed and inspected the cans that lay opened on the blankets . " I for one love American K-rations . But please , gentlemen , you must see to it that Nur Muhammad and I get ones that contain no pork . " " Tonight , " I said with some embarrassment , " everyone has pork and beans . " " Then Nur and I shall make a great show of picking out one shred of pork each and placing it upon your plate . . . thus . Please take this pork from us , Miller Sahib , because we are Muslims . ' But the rest of the pork I shall jolly well keep on my plate , because I love it . " We ate as a family group , two Muslims , a rene/gade Christian and a Jew , and my sense of loneliness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes I noticed that Dr. Stiglitz , who sat facing the pillar , had eaten little . It was after our meal that I learned with pleasure that we would not stay in the serai but were pushing across the desert in the cooler night air . As I left the refuge I said , " One nice thing about it . It 's the only building I 've seen that I can date . It was here in 1220 . " " Probably been rebuilt since then , " Nazrullah said without furthercomment . We went into the night and for the first time in my life I saw the stars hanging low over the desert , for the atmosphere above us containedno moisture , no dust , no impediment of any kind . It was probably the cleanest air man knows and it displayed the stars as no other could . Not even at Qala Bist , which stood by the river , had air been so pure . The stars seemed enormous , but what surprised me most was the fact that they dropped right to the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dunes while to the west others crept beneath piles of shale . While I was staring at the unfamiliar stars , Nazrullah borrowed a light and wrote the following note on a scrap of paper in Persian , Pashto and English : On the evening of April 11 , 1946 , we stopped here to seek evidenceof the missing soldiers but found nothing . Using a sharp piece of shale , he wedged the message into the door and we started up the gully to the desert . Then I understood why Nazrullah had halted our caravan at the serai ; while we were listening to the explanation of the pillar the burning wind had abated and the moon had brightened and was nearly full . It now stood well above the horizon , a huge center of light which made our trip across the desert possible . It was an unworldlyexperience , with moonlight reflecting from the dunes as if it were day . I noticed that we now traveled at less than twenty-five miles an hour , and since the path looked just as good as it had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why and Nur explained , " At night we ca n't spot the Botch. "  | " The what ? " I asked . " Gotch . A flaky white substance that comes in big patches . I think you call it gypsum . " " That 's worth something , gypsum . It occurs in piles ? " " Desert 's full of it , always in patches . That 's where Genghis Khan got his plaster for the pillar . " " So that 's what gypsum 's used for , " I mused . " Mixed with water it 's useful , " Nur cautioned , " but do n't hit it when it 's dry . " At this point we heard a horn blowing insistently , and I looked about for Nazrullah 's flag . It was stationary in a valley ahead and he was signaling us not to follow . " He 's trapped in gotch , " Nur said . " In this light you ca n't see the stuff . " " Did we pass some this afternoon ? " " Acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no trouble . " We parked our jeep and hiked ahead to where Nazrullah was stuck . " Nothing serious , " he said . " The wheels slow down . . .  |p000sh  . " I knelt to feel the gotch and found it a flaky powder , very soft to the fingers and providing no traction for a spinning wheel . " Here 's the rope , " Nazrullah cried . " Give me a little tug . " We edged our jeep carefully forward , attached the rope , and with no trouble pulled Nazrullah free . When he drew up beside us he warned , " If you hit this stuff at more than twenty-five you may break a nose . " " If we do hit , " Nur added , " protect your face . We stop very sud-denly . " It was now our turn to lead , and we set forth upon one of the few flawless journeys a man can take : to be moving over the desertat night when the great stars are overhead and a white moon illuminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression and on the crest to see a great sweep of desert appearing like a cross between a blizzard of snow and a garden of white flowers in spring ; to watch the rise and fall of dunes as they make their poetic march across the shadowy horizon . Most impressive was the silence , the absolute silence of the desert at night . No insects marred it , nop174night birds whispered , there was no echo of wind nor sound of distantthunder . If we stopped to reconnoiter , we could hear Nazrullah'sjeep chattering unseen behind some hill , and I remember once when we had worked ourselves into a cul-de-sac of sweeping dunes how the sound of our engine echoed from each as we tried to fight our way to passages that did not exist . We were hemmed in by floatingsand , but as we studied our position I caught sight of Nazrullah'sflag whisking past us on the correct road . We had proceeded thus some forty miles deeper into the desert when I thought I spied something unusual off to the north . I watched it for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shale . Then I drew Nur Muhammad 's attention , but he had been concentratingso intently on gotch that at first he saw nothing . Finally his eyes adjusted and when they did so he said , " It 's a jeep ! " And I saw that he was right . We then faced the problem of how to flag down Nazrullah , who was well ahead of us . We could drive faster , but that might pitch us into gotch . We could blow our horn , but would they hear ? I suggested , " Let me get down and stand here , so that you can find the jeep when you come back . " Nur looked at me in horror . " In the desert ? " he asked . He flashed his headlights , whereupon Nazrullah 's jeep promptly turned about , and when he had joined us , he asked , " What 's up ? " " Miller found the jeep , " Nur replied . Then he added , " He suggested that he get down and wait here till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My God ! " Then he looked toward the ghostly jeep and said , " I hate to go up there . " Slowly we drove north and it soon became apparent that we were entering a huge concentration of gotch . Nazrullah called out , " Drive back and plant your flag on the hard surface . " We did so and then reassembled our little caravan and moved cautiously forward . Even from a distance we saw what we had hoped not to see : two men sitting in a jeep . They had bogged down in gotch , had tried to pile stones under the wheels , had probably burned out their clutch . We hiked across the soft gypsum and reached the uncanny sight : two men fully dressed for desert travel , resting in their jeep , theirp175eyes wide open but completely dried out . They had been dead for eight or nine days , but rarely had the hand of death been placed so gently upon two human beings , for the desiccating wind , blowing constantly through the day with a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mummified the bodies . " We 'll leave them here , " Nazrullah said finally . " Nothing 'll harm them now . " I studied the bodies for clues , but there were none . The jeep containedample food , some gasoline , but no water . Nazrullah said , " Shift him over , Miller . I 'll see if the clutch works . " With some apprehensionI lifted the driver away from the wheel , while Nazrullahslipped in and started the car . The dead man weighed little . The engine choked , coughed , started . There was no clutch . " Poor bastards , " Nazrullah said . " Put him back . " When we were back at our jeeps he said , " They may have lived two days . . . no more . Miller , if you leave a jeep even for twenty yards in this climate , you 're dead . " Nur asked in Pashto , " I wonder who blamed the other ? " The idea was so unexpected that we all stared at Nur , but we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whatever hideousrecriminations may have passed between them were now silenced . The younger of the two had been driving . When we stopped to recover our flag Nazrullah said with real sadness , " Foolish , foolish men , to take one jeep across this desert . Miller , why do n't you ride with me on this leg ? " After we had taken the lead I asked , " Did you know them ? " " Fortunately no . I 'd hate to think my friends were so idiotic . " We drove for some time , then he chuckled . " It 's rather fun riding with Stiglitz . He 's so German . " " Is it true that he 's a Muslim ? Or is he just kidding ? " " Why not ? He has to live here the rest of his life . " " How do you know that ? " I asked . " The minute he steps across our boundary , the English will arresthim , or the Russians . " " Nazi crimes ? " " Naturally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 've seen the legal papers . That is , the government has . " He said carefully , " I 'd say the charges were n't hypothetical . " I pondered this for some minutes and wondered to myself : If the Afghan government has the dossier , why has n't it been shared with our ambassador , who 's obviously looking Stiglitz over as a possible doctor ? I did n't want to ask Nazrullah about this directly , but I did hit upon what I considered a neat alternative : " Surely the British must know about him , if they 've threatened to arrest him . " " They do , " Nazrullah laughed , for he had guessed the purpose of my question . On his own he added , " As a government , they know his record , and if they could catch him in India , they 'd arrest him . But if he gets clearance for Kabul , which I 'm sure he will , the embassy people as individuals would consult him medically . " Dryly he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way  --  arrest him in New York but use him in Kabul . " " You 're probably right , " I said noncommittally . We dropped the matter there , but later Nazrullah observed , " You expressed surprise that Dr. Stiglitz had become a Muslim . Surely , if I 'd stayed permanently in Dorset , Pennsylvania , with Ellen 's people I 'd have become a Presbyterian . " The fact that he had mentioned Ellen of his own volition startled me , but his casual attitude toward abandoning Islam seemed even more striking , for I was then in the days when I believed that Muslims , Christians and Jews were destined not to shift back and forth , so I argued , " Could you really have become a Christian ? " " For six years in Germany and America I was a Christian in everything but formal conversion . Suppose you lived in Afghanistan permanently , would n't you pray as a Muslim ? " I thought : Would n't he be amused if he knew whom he was askingthis question of . That conceit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in Palestine with the British , could you become a Jew ? " " Why not ? If the facts were known , probably half our Afghan heritage is Jewish . For hundreds of years we boasted of being onep177of the Lost Tribes of Israel . Then Hitler decreed us to be Aryans , which gave us certain advantages . " " What 's your own opinion ? " I asked bluntly . " I think we 're a delightful hodgepodge . Have you heard our marvelousmyth ? In the valleys west of Kabul we have a concentration of the Hazara people . Know what we believe about them ? We claim that every Mongol who ever settled in Afghanistan  --  and there must have been millions  --  settled in those particular valleys and never once intermarried with any of us . A thousand years of racial purity . If the truth were known , I 'm probably descended from the bastards who plastered up that pillar . " " You mean you could become a Jew ? " I repeated seriously . " I probably am a Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Hindu , and a Tajik . But I 'm also a hundred percent Aryan , because I have a certificate from Gottingen University to prove it . " We lapsed again into the deep silence of the desert and the faint stirrings of a brotherhood that was developing between us . Then I asked what I know Nazrullah intended me to ask when he suggested that I ride in his jeep : " Where 's Ellen ? " " She ran away . " " You know where ? " " Not exactly . " " You think she 's alive ? " " I know she is , " he said , clenching his hands on the steering wheel . " I 'm morally sure she is . " From his actions and manner of speech I had to conclude that he was still in love with his wife , hungrily , deeply ; yet I found it almost comical that I should worry about a man , no matter how much I respected him , who was worried about his second wife when he had a perfectly good wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was then too young to know at first hand any of those average American men who deeply loved their wives but who could at the same time becomeagonized if something untoward happened to their mistresses . I t was the same problem in two different guises , but at the time I did n't know it. p 178 " She has n't written to her parents in thirteen months , " I said . With a certain grim humor he asked , " Have you met her par-ents ? " " No , but I 've read their reports . " " Then you know . " He smiled as he recalled them , then added , " They 're like this , Miller . If they 'd seen that pillar at the caravanseraithey 'd have cried , Goodness , something ought to be done about that , ' but they 'd never have understood if you replied , About Genghis Khan you ca n't do anything . ' " He grew painfully intense and said , " There was n't a thing they could have done about Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fated to lose her . And there was n't a goddamned thing that any of us could have done to preventit . " I waited till the signs of his bitterness vanished , then asked , " Is she still in Afghanistan ? " I remember distinctly , and at the time I remarked upon it to myself , that before Nazrullah answered he leaned out to look at the stars , both west and east , then said quietly , " I 'm sure she is . Yes , she 's in Afghanistan . " I wanted to pursue the matter further , but at this moment I saw to the west , where Nazrullah had peered in search of his wife , a star that seemed brighter than the others and pointed it out to my guide . " Good , " he said , halting the jeep till the others could overtake us . When they did he pointed to the star and said , " The City . " I looked again at the star and none of us except Nazrullah knew that it was a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The City , " Nazrullah said . " We 'll camp here . " " If it 's so close , why do n't we finish the drive ? " " It 's sixty miles away , " Nazrullah replied . " Impossible , " I protested , but Nur supported his friend . " When you first see something like this , you ca n't believe it . The light may well be sixty miles away . " " It is , " Nazrullah assured us . " Let 's get out the sleeping bags . " I looked for low ground that would give me some protection fromthe wind that was rising , but Nazrullah led us to the highest part ofa small hill and when we were prepared for bed he explained , " Thatp180night we saw two men who died in the desert from sun and heat . For everyone who dies that way , a hundred die from floods . " Stiglitz and I looked at each other in the white moonlight and Nazrullah continued , " Once every three or four years it rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never saw before . Terrible , shattering . A wall of water builds up thirty feet high and destroys everything before it . Moves whole dunes from one place to another , and anything caught in a low spot is crushed . " We looked at the gullies with new respect as he finished , " Probablyhas n't been any water down there in five hundred years . But just south of here  --  due south , as a matter of fact  --  Alexander the Great was marching his troops home from their conquest of India . They camped in the desert and in four minutes a wall of water swept over them , killing two men in three . This is a tough country , Miller . Do n't sleep in gullies . " At dawn we rose and headed west , and when I saw the last sixty miles of terrain I appreciated why Nazrullah had left Qala Bist in a hurry , for we could not have traversed at night what now faced us , and if we had tried to drive through the heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these last sixty miles the sand had largely disappeared and we were forced to pick our way through heaps of shale which thundered the day 's heat right back at us . The humidity was down to nearly zero and a strong wind dried us out as we moved across the blazing dasht . Nur Muhammad warned me , " Be careful not to bump your nose . The mucus dries up into little needles.which puncture the skin . Bad infection . " Warily I touched my nose , and he was right . The thirsty air had sucked away all moisture , and my nose was lined with needles . At one period I thought I would collapse if we did n't stop for a drink , but Nazrullah fell back to warn us , " We 've plenty of water and cans of fruit juice , but we 're not going to touch it until we 're sure we 'll reach The City today . " He must have seen my disappointment , for he added , " You can discipline yourself , Miller . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States I had never known anything like this , a heat so forceful that it seemed to fightp181with you for all body moisture . I could feel water evaporating from my skin , and my thoughts constantly returned to the soldiers who had perished in the jeep : This damned wind sucked them dry as they sat there . Slowly I began to exercise the discipline of which Nazrullah spoke , and I began to find ways to adjust . I was n't as thirsty as I thought , nor as near dead as I feared . I was on an ugly mission across inhospitable terrain that would kill me if I gave it a chance , but there were many ways to survive , and Nazrullah now taught us one . " We 'd better put on the turbans , " he suggested , and when we had done so he produced a canister of river water , not for drinking , and from it poured water directly onto the turbans until they were dripping down our necks . We then drove on . The turban , about eight yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slowly , lowering the temperature of our heads as it evaporated . I thought : This is the way to lick the heat . But within twelve minutes the voracious wind had sucked all moisture from the cloth . So we stopped again and sloshed on more river water , and for a while we were cool , but after ten or twelve minutes the turbans were again dry . At last we reached a narrow pass that dropped down between rocks , and having descended this canyon for about a mile , we reached a low plain and saw ahead of us trees and signs of life and a village , beyond which lay an ancient city and a large body of water . We cheered and blew our horns , for the transit of the desert was completed . A few Afghans in dirty desert dress straggled out to greet us , but we did not stop . " Tell the sharif we 'll be back ! " Nazrullah called , and we sped for the lake , where we quickly undressed and lay in the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . " Look at him ! " Stiglitz said after a while , and I saw Nazrullah far out from shore , where the water came only to his knees . When I caught up with him he said , " You can walk completely across , if you care to . " It was here , in this vast shallow lake , that the great Helmandp182River ended , for the desert sun and wind evaporated the water as fast as the mountains near Kabul delivered it . The powerful Helmandsimply flowed into the desert and died . I had n't believed it when Nur told me , but here it was , the death of a river . In late summereven this lake might be gone . When we dressed , the sharif joined us . His title was pronounced shot-reef , with the accent on the second syllable , and he brought us melons and fruit , which in their richness , dripped juice from our chins . He listened impassively as Nazrullah explained the location of the missing jeep , and said that he 'd dispatch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths ; if men crossed the desertoften enough , some were bound to die , and many from that area had done so . Talk then turned to the American engineer Pritchard , and we were all brought into the conversation . The sharif reported that twenty-two days ago the American , who worked at Chahar , seventy miles to the south , had broken his leg while taking water levels . It was originally intended to haul him to this village on a stretcher for a trip across the desert , but the sharif at Chahar had felt that local practitioners could heal the leg , and no stretcher was dispatched . A week ago news came to the village that an infection had set in . " Did the broken bones puncture the skin ? " Dr. Stiglitz asked . " We were told so , " the sharif replied . " And they tried to treat a case like that ? " " They 've been doing it for three thousand years , " the sharif grunted . He sent a servant to fetch a man who hobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . " We fixed his . " Dr. Stiglitz examined the leg and said in Pashto , " It 's as good as I 'd have done . " Nazrullah asked , " You 'll send a guide with us ? " " Of course , " the sharif said , and he ordered servants to refill our water bottles . " But I would n't travel in this heat . " " We have to , " Nazrullah replied . And we were off . I have said that when we dropped down off the desert we saw a city by the lake . What we actually saw was one of the marvels of Asia , The City , and we were about to explore a fair portion of itsp183incredible length . For more than seventy miles this nameless metropolisstretched along the lake , the marshes and the river that formed the western boundary between Afghanistan and Persia . At the dawn of history it had been a stupendous settlement . In the age of Alexander it had been one of the world 's major concentrations , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his departure it flourished to become one of the prime targets of the Mongols , and Genghis Khan had once slaughtered most of the people in the area . Tamerlane . . . all the others had ravaged the treasure , and now it stood in majestic silence , mile after mile after mile . I thought : We 're probably in error , calling this a city . It must have been like Route One between New York and Richmond . At intersections there were towns , and some were sizable , but much of the distance must have been interurban , so that city merged into town and town into rural area , with always the roadway itself hemmed in by buildings of some sort . Here the roadway had been the Helmand River , and now as we traversed it we saw the relics of The City . At times there would be walls of substantial height running for miles , broken by majestic gates and marked with niches in which , before the Muslims outlawed human statuary , depictions of local heroes had stood . At other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem a thousand years before the time of Herod . And everything we saw was withering in the dry air , an inch or two eroding every hundred years . There were rugged forts , obviously built by the Muslims : against unorganized shepherds from Persia they must have been impressive ; against the skilled troops of Genghis Khan they probably lasted a day or two , at most , after which all the defenders were slaughtered . We drove along the entire length of The City , and I can not recallmany moments when we were out of sight of really noble monuments . The architecture was solid and secure , wholly fitted to the bleak terrain , and the impression was one of dignity and organization . Qala Bist , at the eastern edge of the Desert of Death , had stunned me with its magnificence . The City , on the western edge ,  |p184left  no such impression . It was so huge , so beyond normal comprehension , and yet so intimate  --  I felt that men had actually walked these streets and collected taxes in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Damn it all , there the stupendous thing was , abandoned in the desert the way Route One , two thousand years from now , might reach in shadowy grandeur from what used to be New York to what used to be Richmond . If the early morning heat on the desert had been oppressive , the heat we experienced at noonday along The City was almost unbearable . Of it I will say only this : Whenever we came upon an irrigationditch or an arm of the river , we jumped from our jeeps , held our watches and wallets over our heads , and plunged fully dressed into the water , soaking in the moisture through aching pores . We then took with us large cans of dirty water , which we poured over our turbans as we rode , but as before , any relief was temporary , for within a few minutes we were once more completely dry . At least ten times we jumped into the ditches , and if we had not been able to do so , we could not have continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection in one of the vast , vacant buildings and wait for nightfall . After one such dunking Nazrullah again asked me to ride with him , but he would not speak of his marriage . He wished to discuss the old days , when The City flourished . " It probably had trade with areas as far removed as Moscow , Peking , Delhi and Arabia . It was never the superb city that Balkh was , but it must have been impressive . What do you suppose killed it ? " " Genghis Khan , " I replied with confidence . " In school I read about him , as a name , but never appreciated what a devastating force he was . He stood before your city and shouted , Here I am ! ' and pretty soon there was no city . " " No , " Nazrullah laughed , " you give good old Genghis too much credit . Now Balkh , the best city we ever had . . . He did destroy that . But not this place . Nor Herat . He wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Herat still exists . He did n't wipe out The City . Something else did that . "  | " Plague ? " I hazarded , for my mind was not yet geared to CentralAsia . " Three hypotheses are predominant , not mutually exclusive , " he said slowly . This was the kind of talk he liked , arguing in Germanicpatterns , like most learned Afghans . I interrupted him , laughing . " It just occurred to me , Nazrullah . I 've been with you and Moheb Khan and Nur Muhammad for some time now , and none of you ever says , By the beard of the Prophet , ' or By the blood of the infidel , ' or Allah shall be revenged . ' I do n't believe you 're real Muslims . " " I have the same complaint against you , " he replied seriously . " Not once do you or the ambassador say By cracky " or Gee whillikens . ' We 're living in a denatured age . " " Proceed , Son of the Prophet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " For a while I dated a Penn coed whose sole knowledge of Asia was that fine ballad Abdul Abulbul Amir . ' Funny thing was , she made about as much sense as any of the others . " " What did wreck The City ? " " First , this used to be the world 's foremost example of irrigation . I think Alexander commented on that . You can see relics of the old system everywhere . Over there , for example . Probably a reservoir . But people got lazy . They did n't keep working on it . They felt that what had worked for a hundred years was good enough for the next hundred years . They stopped cleaning the ditches . . . built no new dams . They guessed right . For a hundred years , no trouble . But the death warrant had been signed . Genghis Khan ca n't be blamed for that . The people had grown fat and lazy . " Second , and I place much emphasis on this , there was salt . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of water must deposit salt , so that each year you raise a crop , you deteriorate the land that made the crop possible . Therefore I do n't blame the lazy people entirely . Maybe the salt was just too big a problem to handle . In some future century , perhaps , all of Colorado and Utah will be useless because the men of this century were such goodp186farmers . Your salt levels are rising ominously . Behold , Denver , Colorado ! " And he pointed to the ruins . " The third reason is the most tantalizing of all . Goats . Those damned goats are the curse of Asia . God gave us a fertile land , covered with magnificent trees and soil rich enough to feed all men . But the Devil got even by giving us just one thing . Goats . And they took care of the forests . Ate all the young trees . And the rich fields . Ate the cover off and turned them to deserts . Probably the most destructive animal ever created . Much more dangerous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The City ? " I asked . " When this was a metropolis , " Nazrullah explained , " the hills you see must have been covered with trees . Brisk business in timber and charcoal . Excessive cutting killed some forests , but goats took care of the rest . So today in Afghanistan we have almost no forests . Do you suppose we live in mud houses on purpose ? They 're miserable , but we have no wood . All the time I was in America I wondered , What is the goat in America ? ' I found out . It 's the man who destroys your forests . " He paused , then observed , " You defeated Germany in this war , but in the future Germany 's bound to win . Because Germans plant trees . " I tried to lead the conversation back to Ellen Jaspar but was forestalledwhen our guide , perched on the spare tires behind my ear , sang out that we were approaching Chahar , where Pritchard lay . We looked for a ditch and plunged in to refresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind sucked us dry , and when our turbans were no longer wet we replaced them with karakul caps . We straightened our clothes to make ourselves as presentable as- possible , and while we were doing this I asked , " Why all the falderal ? , " Nazrullah replied , " Down here you impress the sharif , or you get nothing . " As we drove into the village he added , " We 're so far from Kabul that government does n't actually exist , except in the person of this brigand who rules as he wishes . Who 's going to drive across that desert to correct him ? "  |p187It  was an attractive village with an oversized caravanserai and cool pomegranate trees whose blossoms sent me an unfamiliar fragrance . The sharif came out to greet us , a huge fellow well over six feet in height , and I thought : How often we choose tall men to governus . And this sharif governed , that was obvious . As absolute monarch of a tiny kingdom , he had his own army , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close to Persia and so far from Kabul , his little kingdom used mainly Persian coins and Persian stamps . " Dozensof these principalities remain in Afghanistan , " Nazrullah explained , and I understood why , in Chahar , the evacuation of an American with a broken leg was impossible . When you got sick here , the local medicine man cured you , or you died . The sharif led us to a low , stifling hut tucked away in a corner of the caravanserai , and there on a straw mattress laid over a rope bed we found the gaunt , gray-faced American engineer John Pritchard , a wiry man in his late forties . Nazrullah held out his hand and said , " Hello , Professor . The American embassy 's sent a man to get you out of here . " " I 'm willing to go . . . right now , " the sick man replied . The sharif 's servants had kept him clean , fed and shaved , but he was in pitiful shape and I sensed at once that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to dry air to speed the healing , had been puncturedby two fractures and was now clearly gangrenous . The skin was taut and greenish . Dr. Stiglitz hurried to the bed and studied the leg for some minutes , smelling his fingers as he did so . He then probed the man 's groin and armpits . When he was done he placed his right hand on Pritchard 's shoulder and said quietly , " Herr Professor Pritchard , the leg must come off . " The engineer groaned and his face went even whiter than it had been . Stiglitz continued , as if to convince the rest of us , " In my opinion there 's no chance on earth to save this leg . I 'm positive other doctorswould agree . I 'm sorry , Herr Professor , but you must know . " Pritchard made no further sound ; he must have expected such a decision.  |p188Stiglitz  added in a dispassionate professional voice , " We face a difficult choice , for which we are all responsible  --  Pritchard , Nazrullah , Miller . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you recuperate ? Tell me that . Or I can medicate the leg now , then rush you back to Kandahar , where the operation could be performed much better and where you could recuperate at ease . In that case the question is , Could you stand the trip across the desert ? " Each waited for the other to speak , then Pritchard said firmly , " If I stay here , I will surely die . " Stiglitz asked , " Then you want to go back to Kandahar ? " " Yes ! Yes ! " Pritchard cried . " What do you think , Nazrullah Sahib ? " Stiglitz continued . " I 'd like to ask one question , " Nazrullah countered . " Professor Pritchard , you remember what the desert was like . Do you feel strong enough to cross it now ? " " Yes ! " Pritchard repeated . " If I stay here I 'll die . " " We 'll take you to Kandahar , " Nazrullah said firmly , and when the decision was reached he became once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said crisply , " We must get back to The City before darkness . We 'll sleep there . Start across the desert at dawn . You fellows up to it ? " Nur and Stiglitz said they were . Then he addressed Pritchard directly : " This is the last chance . You 're sure you can cross the desert ? " " Right now , " the engineer replied . " We go , " Nazrullah announced . But I was appalled , both at the decision itself and at the hasty manner in which it had been reached . " Wait a minute ! " I protested . " Dr. Stiglitz , is Professor Pritchard qualified to make a decision like this ? " " I am , " Pritchard interrupted . " I 've waited here too damned long . If I stay here , I 'm going to die . " " Have you ever crossed the desert ? " I asked , betraying my nervousnessat intervening in such a matter , for I was the youngest present . " I 'm here , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the heat ? "  | " Look , Miller , I refuse to stay here . Let 's get going . " " The heat ? " I shouted . " Have you ever crossed in daytime ? " " Yes ! " the sick man shouted back . " I can take it . " I appealed to Dr. Stiglitz . " You know very well , Doctor , that intenseheat and movement will increase the danger from that leg . " The German was silent and I shouted , " Do n't you ? " " Yes , " Stiglitz grudgingly assented . " And every minute we do n't operate increases the risk . " " That 's what I thought , " I said weakly . I felt as if I were going to burst into tears . Very quietly I said , " We 'll operate here  --  right now . " Stiglitz spoke solemnly : " But the risk to his life is just as great here , Herr Miller . " " For God 's sake ! " I cried . " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no answer , yes or no , " the German replied stubbornly . " There is risk . There is risk here and risk there . I can not decide . " He turned to Pritchard and asked gently , " You know you 're in grave danger , do n't you Herr Professor ? " " Three days ago I thought I was dead , " Pritchard said . " I 'm not afraid any longer . In your opinion , Doctor , which way gives me the best mathematical chance ? " " That I can not answer , " Stiglitz insisted . " You and your Americanadviser must decide . " The sick man looked up at me , and I almost had to turn away , death seemed so close . " Young fellow , " he said quietly , " I calculate my own chances as being best if we go to Kandahar . " I was so certain that once we got that leg on the desert it would insure his death , pumping poison constantly throughout his body , that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the doctor 's impartiality . I knew we must take the leg off at once . In my anguish I looked at Nazrullah and said , " Could we walk in the garden a moment ? " " You 're wasting time , " Nazrullah warned me . " I need your advice , " I said . " You have my advice . . . Kandahar . " " Please , " I begged.  |p190Against  his will I led him out beneath the pomegranate trees , sweet in the spring , where I had a chance to confront the hard quality of his mind . " You 're the American in charge , " he said harshly . " You must decide . . . in fifteen minutes . " " But , Nazrullah , you 're a scientist . You know that a leg like that is pumping poison right through that man 's blood . He ca n't possibly get to Kandahar . " " The doctor thinks he can . I think he can . We should leave . " " But if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? " " Absolutely , Miller . I 'll stay here a month if necessary . You make the decision and I 'll abide by it . But make the decision . " " Help me do what 's best , " I pleaded . " There 's a man dying in there . " " I ca n't do your job for you , " he said coldly . " Could I see the doctor again ? For just a minute ? " " Stiglitz ? He 's incapable of a moral decision . He said clearly : The facts are these . You decide . " " What did he say the facts were ? " I asked , sweating nervously . " I want to hear them from him again before we decide . " " No ! " Nazrullah cried . " You ca n't evade your responsibility . " " Please , review with me what he said . I do n't have it clear . " " He said , " Nazrullah repeated impatiently , " that Pritchard would probably die , whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . " " He never said that ! " I protested in real confusion . " He implied it . He believes it . And if that 's true , which I 'm sure it is , the problem becomes simple . What 's best for your country and mine ? " " That 's a hell of a way to talk about a man who may be dying . " " Miller , he is dying . What 's best for you and me to do ? Speak up or we 're leaving . " " Wait a minute . Let me think , " I pleaded . " Nazrullah , we know he wants to get out of here . How much weight should I put on that fact ? " " The whole weight , Miller . If he stays here he knows he 'll die . "  |p191I  hesitated , then said firmly , " All right . We take him to Kan-dahar . " " That 's your decision ? " " Yes . Let 's get started . Right now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you trying to do ? " I cried . " Things like this often end badly , " Nazrullah said cautiously . " Americans like to blame Afghans . . . make us look stupid . If a stupid decision is being made , you 'll make it , and you 'll put it in writing . " " I 'm not afraid , " I said bravely , feeling much older than twentysix . " But in that case I 've got to talk with Stiglitz and Pritchard . " " You have ten minutes , " Nazrullah said . " After that we stay here . . . for many weeks . " We returned to the sick room and I asked Dr. Stiglitz to join me in the garden . He protested but Nazrullah said in German , " Go ahead . " " Your honest judgment , Stiglitz , and you ca n't evade now . What 's best for this man ? " " This is a decision I can not make , " Stiglitz insisted stubbornly . " That 's a hell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the only one under the circumstances , " he said defensively . " What are the circumstances ? " I shouted , losing control of my patience under the hammering I was undergoing . " Pritchard is going to die , " he replied bluntly . " I say that if we take the leg off right now he 'd have a chance . " " You 're right . " " And if you haul him through the desert death is almost in-evitable . " " You 're right . " " Then for God 's sake , let 's go in there and operate . " " I warned you , Herr Miller , that this is not a decision I can make . Pritchard is convinced that if he stays here any longer he will die . His spirit is worn out . . . can you understand that at your age ? Worn out . It might be wiser for him to risk the journey to Kandahar if it restores his hope . "  | " Who can decide this ? " " Pritchard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll write out the order in five minutes . " " You 'd better , " he said . I went to the sickbed and before I spoke to Pritchard I looked at the bleak walls of the caravanserai and smelled the stale , baked air . I would not have wanted to live in that room , even in health . But to have lain in that stifling heat for three weeks while local practitioners ruined my leg , to have watched it swell and grow green , would have been intolerable , and now to face the prospect of six more weeks would kill my spirit . I sat on the bed and told Pritchard , " I guess it 's up to you and me . Here or Kandahar ? " " I know I 'm in bad shape . But if I stay here . . . what 'd you say your name was ? " " Miller . I 'm from the embassy . " Then I had an idea . " You know , Professor Pritchard , the ambassador himself sent me here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know anybody gave a damn . " He turned his head , unable to control his tears . " Jesus , Miller , this is the end of the world . " " I can see that , " I agreed . " How the hell did I get here ? " he mumbled . " Making a water study for a nation that just do n't give a damn . " " Do n't say that . You wrote to us about Nazrullah . He 's a fine engineer . " " The guy with the beard ? " " Trained in Germany , " I assured him . " Some of the best come from Germany , " he said in the approvingmanner of practical men who recognize excellence whereverdeveloped . " You 're determined to make the run to Kandahar ? " " If I stay here I 'll die . " " You appreciate the risk ? " His spirit cracked . Rising on one elbow he shouted , " If you'rep193afraid of your lousy job , I 'll put it in writing . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do the writing , " I said , feeling miserable , for I knew I was condemning him to death . I called Nur Muhammad to bring my brief case , and on official paper I wrote : Chahar , Afghanistan April 12 , 1946I have this day ordered the American irrigation engineer John Pritchard to he transported to the hospital in Kandahar , so that medical attention unavailable here may be given his badly infected left leg . Mark MillerUnited States Embassy Kabul , AfghanistanFeeling sick at what I had done , I handed Nazrullah the directive . He read it twice , showed it to Stiglitz and Nur Muhammad , and folded it carefully . " We 'll leave in ten minutes , sleep at the edge of the desert and start our crossing as soon as we can negotiate that bad approach . " He had overlooked one fact . John Pritchard refused to leave his post until his water-level records were collected . " That 's why I came here , " he said . " If they want to build that dam , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Stiglitz supported him . " A scientist should keep records , " the German said . So I was led by a guide to a spot two miles down the Helmand , where John Pritchard had been collecting the data on which Nazrullahwould build his dam . More significantly , perhaps , Pritchard'sword would form the basis for riparian treaties between Afghanistan and Persia , who had threatened war over the river . We found a small shed , boiling hot , some water gauges , a sheaf of irreplaceable records . The guide warned me in Pashto to watch the steps leading to the shed , for it was here that Pritchard had broken his leg ; and as I stood in this lonely shack , this veritable end of the world where the temperature was daily above a hundred and thirty , I thought of all the careless speeches made inp194Congress about the cookie-pushers of the State Department , those striped-pants boys who haunt afternoon teas , and I wished that some of the arrogant speakers could have seen the work that John Pritchard had accomplished for our nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked the guide . It was a kind of judgment he had not previously been asked to make , and he was confused . Finally he said brightly , " Yes , he could handle a gun with skill . " I was to ride with Nazrullah in his jeep , while Nilr and Stiglitz supervised loading Pritchard in the back of theirs . As they did so the German said heartily , " If I ever saw a man with a good chance to get across the desert , it 's this one . " " We 'll make it ! " the engineer called as we set forth , and it became my duty when we stopped to pour as much water as possibleover the stricken man , thus keeping his temperature down , but before we had traveled far he became partially delirious and asked that I ride with him , as he wished to speak of America . Thus we rode past the brooding , empty buildings of The City , and in the cooler evening his fever abated and we talked . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each autumn hunting in the Rockies . He was , he admitted , a fairly good rifle shot and had bagged elk , bear and mountain goats . He had a low opinion of the latter and felt they did more harm than good . He was optimisticabout one thing : said he knew a one-legged man in Lovelandwho had no trouble hunting . " I 'm the kind of man , " he said , " who wo n't give up till I learn how to walk with a wooden leg . " But at the next stop Dr. Stiglitz decided to give Pritchard a knock-out pill , and the engineer fell asleep.  |p195As  soon as morning light permitted , we negotiated the canyon , and when the sun was well ablaze we were on the desert , stopping frequentlyto pour water on our turbans . At first I rode with Nur and the sick man , keeping his body under wet compresses , but he grew constantly worse , and at one of the water stops Stiglitz insisted upon changing places with me so that he might supervise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pritchard alive worked . At the start of our trip I had given the engineer no chance to live , but apparently I was going to be proved wrong . I now rode with Nazrullah , and after we had discussed Pritch/ard 's leg , he asked me bluntly , " What else do you need to know about my wife ? " The question startled me , for I had been devising stratagems whereby I could trick him into comment , and for a moment I could not think clearly , so I repeated lamely , " She ran away ? " " Yes . Last September . " " That 's eight months ago , " I stammered . " Seems longer , " he reflected , rubbing his beard . In his soggy , formless turban he looked quite Asiatic . " Why did she run away ? " " You would n't understand , " he replied with a nervous laugh . He wanted to be helpful , but the facts were so preposterous that he was unable to evaluate them , so he kept silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth between his sick wife and Dr. Stiglitz : he would report only what he himself understood . I appreciated his efforts at good will , for the conditions under which we rode made conversation difficult . The desert was intolerablyhot and we were both gasping for air . " This must be hell on Pritchard , " he observed . " It 's what I was worried about yesterday , " I reminded him . " We 've been through that ! " he cautioned . " I have your order , in writing . " " Did you warn Ellen Jaspar that . . " That I was married ? Yes . " " The other day in Kandahar I met your wife , your Afghan wife , that is . " " I know . Karima told me about it in her letter . " " How could she send a letter ? " I asked , like a movie detectivetrapping a suspect . " I saw her only a short time before I left . " " The messenger who brought Dr. Stiglitz also brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at my own suspicions . " I 'm sorry , " I apologized . " This whole thing seems so shadowy . " " To me it 's even more so , " he confessed . " Then what Karima said was true ? You did tell Ellen ? " " Whatever Karima says is apt to be true . "  | " Is she a beautiful girl ? " I asked for no obvious reason . " Very . It was stupid of her to wear the chaderi . I do n't require it . " I suspect she was afraid of Nur Muhammad . " Inappropriately , Nazrullah began to laugh and I must have looked at him with censure , for he said , " I 'm sorry , but when you mentioned the chaderi I remembered something which explains Ellen rather better than anything else I could tell you . I sympathize with your suspicions . You 're sure that I mistreated her and that my family kept her prisoner and that she 's walled up somewhere pining for freedom . Miller , when she arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . tried to make her feel at ease . You know what she did ? On the morning after the marriage she came down to breakfast wearing a chaderi . " " What ? " " Yes , at breakfast . A very expensive silk chaderi which she had asked a dressmaker in London to make from a picture in a book . She was going to be more Afghan than the Afghans . My family tried not to laugh , and I had tears in my eyes to think that she was such a good sport . We explained that you do n't wear a chaderi at breakfast . But I had one hell of a time keeping her from wearing it on the street . " He laughed in memory of that bizarre event as a father laughs during a business lunch when he recollects his child 's mistakes . " You may have heard that one day in Kandahar the mullahs spat at her . When it was all over , she started to cry , not at the mullahs but at me . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this would n't have happened . ' " " I do n't understand . " " None of you Americans understand what an extraordinary woman Ellen is . Obviously her parents did n't . Nor her professors . Do n't call her a girl any more . She is a woman . I doubt that she was ever a girl . She is a rare human being who sees through to the essence of God . I suppose you know that on one of our first dates she told me all about the atomic bomb . "  | " You met her in 1944 , " I checked . " At that time there was n't such a bomb . " " She invented it , " he said cryptically . I looked at him askance and he was about to elaborate when the rear jeep signaled us to stop , and in the moments we waited for them to overtake us he added , " Ellen foresaw that if the nations continued their madness , they would be forced to invent some super-terrible weapon . She even described it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they 'll deliver it by air , and it 'll wipe out whole cities . ' She added that there was no way to prevent it and probably no way to escape . She said , I hope I can get to Afghanistan before they destroy us all . ' At first I thought she was using us as a refuge . . . because we would be the last place bombed , but that was n't her idea . She told me , There is n't going to be any refuge , and if I 'm to die , I want to die in Afghanistan , which is as far away from our pitiful civilization as any place I know . Let 's live and die close to primitive things . ' I suppose that 's what she had in mind when she protested my building the dam . " Dr. Stiglitz walked gloomily to our jeep and said frankly , " He wo n't make it , Nazrullah . He wants Miller to ride with him . " But I was so close to probing Nazrullah 's secret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Nazrullah . . . just a little longer . " Stiglitz said without expression , " Pritchard wants to talk , too . To an American . " " Forgive me , " I said , and when I took my seat , close to the engineer 's fevered head , I started applying towels , but he merely gasped and rolled his eyes at me . He was very close to death . Finally he whispered , " I ca n't breathe . " Nur was weeping . " I ca n't breathe either , " I assured the dying man . " This heat . " " With you the cause is different , " he replied lucidly . " You do n't carry a leg that 's beating like a drum . I can feel it pumping poison . " I bit my tongue to keep from reminding him that he was repeatingmy words . I said , " We 're better than halfway through the desert . " " I want you to give my wife a message , " he said with painful effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tellp199her . . . " He winced , as an almost visible pain streaked across his face , driving him to incoherency . I soaked his turban and applied wet rags to his leg . The river water was used up and I proposed to Nur , " We 've got to use some of our drinking water . " Nur looked at me in dismay , studied the desert ahead , then listened to Pritchard moan . I saw tears start down his cheek and dry to salt in the desperate air . " If he needs water , give it to him , " he said in Pashto . I poured some of the drinking water over Pritchard 's head and he regained consciousness long enough to dictate jumbled phrases to his wife . She was to consult with a Mr. Forgraves in Denver . The kids must graduate from college , both of them . Then , for some reason I did n't understand , he went into a long discourse about a new kind of paint he had seen described in a technical journal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be worth two hundred dollars but he thought she might get it for less . " Pritchard , " I broke in after the paint monologue , " I think I 'd better get Dr. Stiglitz . " " Do n't . If I 'm gon na die , let me die with my kind , not some goddamned Nazi . " He started shivering . Then a dreadful sweat broke out across his face and little rivulets of perspiration accumulated , to be evaporated instantly in the swirling heat . " I 'm burning up ! " he shouted . Nur Muhammad , who heard the conversation , began to cry openly and finally stopped the jeep . " I will not drive a man to meet death , " he sobbed as he stood bareheaded in the sun . " If death wants this man , death must comehere . " In a kind of frenzy I saw the jeep ahead puffing away , so I blew the horn repeatedly . " Knock off the noise , you kids , " Pritchard cried . Nazrullah caught my signal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell 's the matter with you ? " he stormed at Nur . " I will not drive a man to meet death , " Nur stubbornly repeated . Taking a small rug from his gear , he spread it on the sand and , kneeling westward to Mecca , prayed.  | " He looks awful , " Nazrullah said , and Dr. Stiglitz hurried over to check the delirious engineer . A strange , desert prayer came to my lips , silently : " Oh , God , spare my countryman . " At the mumbling of these words , John Pritchard died . I looked distractedly at Nazrullah , who shrugged his shoulders and said , " It was a chance . Nobody thought it was a good chance . " The callousness of this remark made me want to storm at the incompetentswho had permitted this disgraceful suicide , but that obligationwas taken from me by Nur Muhammad , who wept , " You 're all criminals . Bringing this doomed man onto the desert . " This was too much . I shouted , " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nobody asked me , " he sobbed , and it occurred to me that if he had once supported my argument , we never would have left Chahar and Pritchard would now be alive . But I knew why he had remained silent : he had been afraid to contradict his social superior , Nazrullah , so now we were on the desert with a dead body to deliver . . . remorselessly assaulted by the noonday heat . Nur Muhammad was quite incapable of driving , so I took charge of the second jeep , the one with the corpse , and we headed for Kandahar , but when we reached about forty miles an hour on the shale I suddenly saw looming ahead a field of gotch , which I swerved sharply to avoid , recalling the soldiers who were dead for not having done so , and I threw the jeep against a series of jolting rocks which snapped the front axle . Nur Muhammad went to pieces , berating himself for the fact that he was not at the wheel in this difficult terrain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep and now lay in horrible contortion on the dasht . Nazrullah , in contrast , was superb . He quieted Nur , absolved me of blame , and helped Dr. Stiglitz load the corpse into the workable jeep . He then quietly studied his map and informed us , " The Caravanserai of the Tongues must be a little distance to the north . We 'll tow the broken jeep there and decide what to do . " But while we were attaching two ropes Dr. Stiglitz said , " Whyp201do n't we drive back and take the front axle from the jeep of the two soldiers ? " Nazrullah stopped sharp , dropped the ropes and stood in the blazing sun considering the alternatives the German had suggested . Clutching his beard he mumbled , " Why did n't I think of that ? Stupid . Stupid . " He walked away from us , positioning his opened hands as if they were two jeeps . For a long time he strode back and forth across the desert , then returned to us . " For three reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " First , I 'm not sure we could find the other jeep if we wanted to . " " It 's right back there . " I pointed . " It 's more than forty miles , " he corrected , " and sometimes you ca n't find things a second time in the desert . Second , we do n't have enough water to double back and forth . But most important , supposethe sharif 's scouting party has already been there ? Suppose we go back and find that the jeep is gone ? " Saying no more , he completed tying the ropes , then hauled us up to the Caravanserai of the Tongues , into which we limped at four that afternoon . His note was still fastened to the door . We pushed the jeep into one of the honeycomb rooms , then held a council in which Nazrullah explored the alternatives available to us . We decided that two men in the good jeep must try to get back to Qala Bist , taking Pritchard 's body along . It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what food could be spared , must remain at the caravanserai with the damaged jeep until such time as a rescue party could return . " There 's only one question , " Nazrullah concluded . " How shall we pair up ? " Learning from the past , I responded quickly : " I 'll write an orderand accept full responsibility . Stiglitz and Nur will stay here . Nazrullah and I will drive to Qala Bist . " " Reasonable , " Stiglitz grunted . Nur Muhammad , still shaken , wrecked that plan . He sniffled , " It 's my duty to stay with Miller Sahib . " " Your duty is discharged , " I replied in Pashto . " No ! You are in my care , " Nur insisted.  | " The whole argument 's irrelevant , " Nazrullah said . " If anyone must cross the desert it 's got to be the Afghans . Miller and Stiglitz , stay here . Nur , jump in the jeep . " Nur started to voice some new objection , but Nazrullah shouted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , scram ! " When Nur was settled , Nazrullah and I hiked with the water jugs to the stagnant pool that provided a meager supply for the caravanserai . " Can you live on this stuff for three or four days ? " he asked . " You get back here before then , " I joked , but I remembered the terror that Nazrullah felt about being on the desert with only one jeep , so I took all the jugs of sweet water and gave them to him . As I did so I said , " Keep this crate away from the gotch . " As he drove off he assured me , " When I come back to get you , Miller , I 'll answer all your questions about Ellen . That 's a promise . " He headed the jeep back toward the desert he dreaded , and I last saw him speeding eastward , his lone flag whipping in thepace-like air . At dusk Dr. Stiglitz and I ate a frugal meal and drank a little of the brackish water . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive . We then went out to watch the blazing sun sink behind the dunes and sat together in the refreshing coolness until the great stars appeared , and the white moon . We were about to retire when Stiglitz whispered , " What 's that ? " And we heard a soft sound , as if a human being were creeping upon us . We remained very silent , and then saw moving into the moonlighta small group of gazelles , more graceful now , perhaps , than they had been in sunlight . They had been feeding somewhere to the north and were returning to the safety of the desert , where none of their predators could surprise them . They formed such a contrast to the ugly death we had witnessed , that both Stiglitz and I watched them for many minutes . Then , with an unexpected clap of his hands , he startled the little beasts and they leaped and spun in the moonlight , vanishing at last over the dunes . " Exquisite , " Stiglitz whispered , and for the first time I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know why he had made the incredible decision of hauling Pritchard onto thep203desert , and I was about to question him on this when he said , " It 's after nine . Let 's get ready for bed . " We entered the vast caravanseraiand lit our Coleman lamp , studiously avoiding the ghostly pillar at the far end of the fort . But it was thereI said , " You surprised me at Chahar when you refused to make a medical decision . . . when the facts were so clear . Once Pritchard carried that leg into the desert . ... he was doomed . Why did n't you support me ? " " Was he doomed ? " Stiglitz asked cautiously . " Of course he was . Even I saw that . " Something in the way I spoke shattered the empathy we had felt while watching the gazelles . Perhaps Stiglitz suspected that when I returned to Kabul I would use Pritchard as an excuse for not recommending him to our ambassador . A darkness came over his face and he asked contemptuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? Well , let me tell you , my young friend , I could n't make it . And I 've been a doctor damned near as long as you 've been alive . There are many diagnosesyou 're not qualified to make , Herr Miller . " Without warning he rose and stamped off to the pillar , taking with him our only carving knife , which he scraped vigorously against the plaster , as if driven by some harsh compulsion . " Nazrullah said it 's a national monument , " I warned from the opposite end of the room . " It 's a universal monument , " he corrected me , " and I 'm going to see what 's inside . He spoke with determination , then called , " Come here , Miller . It 's a human skull . " Against my better judgment I walked slowly down the room , lugging the Coleman lamp , which Dr. Stiglitz grabbed from my hand to hold against the pillar . Behind the inch of plaster I could see a rounded bone . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many bodies would you estimate are in this pillar ? " Before I could answer he did a most ghoulish thing . He planted the lantern in the middle of an open space and said , " This will be the central pole . " Then he lay flat on the earth , his toes near the lantern , and commanded me : " Mark where my shoulders come . "  |p204When  the scratches were in the earth , he shifted his body so that I could mark off a new shoulder , and so on around the imaginary pillar . " Well , " he concluded with some satisfaction , " that makes thirty bodies jammed into one layer . Now how many layers ? " He stepped back to calculate the number of tiers required to reach the roof . " Perhaps forty-five layers . " He paused and a slow look of horror crossed his face . " My God ! There 's over thirteen hundred people in that pillar . " We sat on the floor , surveying the grisly monument , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked , " When Pritcharddied , did I see you crossing yourself ? " " Yes . " " You were a Catholic ? " " In Munich , yes . " " Yet you turned apostate ? " " Of course . Since I 'm to live here the rest of my life . " " Why ? " I asked bluntly . " Surely you 've been told , Herr Miller , " he said with contempt . " That 's why this pillar fascinates me . Gives me hope . " " What do you mean by that ? " I asked . " It proves what I 've always suspected . The things we did in Germany . . . the really dreadful things , are what men have alwaysdone . " Before I could express my disgust at excusing the civilized man Adolf Hitler by citing the barbarian Genghis Khan , he added , " In each civilization some men run wild . If we 're lucky , we control them early . If not . , . . " He pointed to the pillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he marshaled strong support for his idea that what he had seen in Germany was a recurring sickness which might strike any nation at any time . I argued against this theory of inevitability , but he was adamant in extending it . " To be specific , " he said , " I have n't been to America but I 've seen your films and read your books . I 'm positive that in your country there would be no difficulty in finding S.S. volunteers forp205the job of collecting Negroes and throwing them into concentration camps . " " Wait a minute ! " I cried , condescendingly . " Herr Miller ! " he replied , pulling my face close to his . " Do n't you know in your heart that you could do to the Negroes what we did to the Jews ? " I said quietly , " Do n't judge us by the fact that we have a few sick people . " " You have an endless supply , " he assured me . " We turned ours loose on Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But never Buchenwald , " I resisted . " In the beginning , never , " he agreed . " Your sensibilities would not permit it . Your Bill of Rights . . . But after two or three years of total propaganda . . . the president , churches , newspapers , cinema , labor unions . . . do n't you understand that you would find many Americans eager to shoot down Negroes with machine guns ? " " No , " I announced confidently . " Herr Miller , you 're an idiot , " he stormed . To my surprise he leaped to his feet and rushed to the pillar , which he banged with his fist . " Do you think that Genghis Khan started with this pillar ? No . He marched step by step until this pillar was nothing . I could find in any American city you care to mention men who would be glad  --  joyous , shall we say  --  to be led step by step until they were building this pillar with living bodies . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Herr Miller , no ! Do you think I started with this ? " He beat the pillar until I expected his knuckles to come away bleeding . Breathing hard , he came and sat beside me . It was now past midnight and we were both worn by the tragic day on the desert , but the pillar kept us awake , and Stiglitz said softly , " Do you really think , Herr Miller , that the reports the Allied governments have on me started with a pillar like that grisly thing ? Oh , no ! I was a fine , respectable doctor in Munich , married to the daughter of an important businessman . . . a member of the church.  |p206My  wife and I saw certain promotions available through the Nazi party and we joined . Many prudent men and women did . It was easy at first . The Jews , whom we all despised "  --  he told me this in a confidential voice , as if I would appreciate why any reasonable man would despise Jews ; indeed , as if our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sequestered . That was all , sequestered . " One day they asked me to check the health of the Jews they rounded up , and I did so , very carefully . Believe me , Herr Miller , if I found a Jew who needed an expensive medicine , I said so , and there are many Jews alive today solely because I prescribed expensive medicine for them . " He nodded in confirmation of his own plea , and I judged that he had often conducted this dialogue with himself . There were Jews living today because of what Dr. Stiglitz had done for them , of that I was sure . " If I were ever brought to trial , " he assured me with great confidence , " the health records of the City of Munich would show case after case where I saved the lives of Jews . It 's all there . . in the reports . " He looked at me beseechingly , a tired , pudgy man with turbanedhead , wrinkled brow and worried eyes . I thought , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back to the lantern , and all I could see was shadow . Persuasively , cautiously , his words resumed : " Unexpectedly other problems arose . A Jew was to be certified mentally deficient so he could be sterilized . The government wanted me to designate a complete stranger as threequartersJewish so his property could be confiscated . I 'd never seen him before , but he was obviously Jewish . . . you can always tell a Jew . So step by step my soul was corrupted . " He was driven by some deep hatred back to the pillar , which he hammered with his open hands . " Miller , " he cried in a hoarse shout , " do you suppose that the man who applied this plaster over living , breathing mouths started with this job ? Do you believe that you 're immune ? " " To killing Jews , yes ! " " Ah , but the Negro is your Jew . Are you immune there ? "  | " Of course ! " I shouted in disgust . " Herr Miller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He beat the pillar again . " This is your pillar , too , . This is the pillar of Americans and Englishmen and Germans alike . I could n't have built this alone , you know . " To my embarrassment his voice began to choke , as if he were going to burst into tears of confession . Then , thank heavens , he gained control of himself and rejoined me on the floor . It was now about two in the morning and in the flickering light of our Colemanlamp I could see his drawn face , weary yet driven to further revelation , and in some strange way he looked as he had that night in the square at Kandahar when he was condemning the dancers . I could hear his voice speaking the words but this time applying them somehow to his own history : They 're cruel little sodomites . When they come to town they create a great evil . What ugly passage in his own life among the Nazis did that repeated phrase illuminate ? Toward four he got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were winning the war on all fronts  --  it was 1941  --  they came to me and said , We 're looking for a director of research . Military problems of the gravest significance . Involved is the final destruction of England . ' What could I say ? I was flattered . " They gave me a fine laboratory in Munich . I could live at home . " He seemed to savor , here in the Afghan desert , those bright visions of a happy German home life in Munich . " I could live at home , " he explained persuasively , as if eager to convince me . " I had to take the job , you can see that . At first it was routine experiments on colds , . . . very sensible , very productive . I believethey 're selling in America now a cold remedy that came from my researches . I convinced myself that I was helping win the war . " I enjoyed other successes and then one day in 1943 they asked me to explore a purely theoretical question : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a nice question . A very importantone , militarily speaking . " He paused a long time to stare at the pillar , then laughed in a high-pitched giggle . " Without myp208knowing it , we were about to conduct pragmatic experiments on the same subject . . . at Stalingrad . " He laughed openly . Undoubtedlyhe had used the joke before . " A fascinating medical question , Herr Miller , " he said reflectively . " How much cold can a human being tolerate ? Yesterday , for example . You were very hot . . thought you could n't take any more . But Nazrullah said , You can discipline yourself , ' and the thermometer rose fourteen degrees and you did discipline yourself . How much heat could you have stood ? That 's a nice question . How much cold . . . I remember the exact phrasing because I wrote it down the day they posed it . You see , Herr Miller , I have a love for keeping records . Yesterday I could sympathize with John Pritchard when he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from careful records that science can . . . " His voice broke and he dropped his head in his hands . His turban fell off and I could see the gray hairs on his stubbly head ; I could see his shouldersmoving up and down , silently . Finally he put his hand on my knee and said , " The English captured my records , . I was meticulous . I was meticulous . " For some minutes we said nothing , then he rose , overcome by a terrible emotion which I did not try to specify , and walked about the pillar several times , his mouth moving as if he were making a speech . The flickering light  --  the Coleman lamp gives a very white light and throws facial shadows in deep relief  --  made him look old . Suddenly he leaned against the pillar and issued a flood of words : " In the cage there was this Jew . About fifty years old , a fine human being . His name . . . you can check this in the records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of experiments and had proved what required to be proved , but I had not appliedmy findings to an average , healthy man like the older soldiers in our army . So I chose Sem Levin . I chose him right from a nondescriptgroup in the cage . I told my aide , That 's the man ! Now we 'll see what 's what . ' " He hesitated . He could look from the pillar to where I sat and he must have seen the horror and revulsion rising in my face , but he could not silence himself . " Each morning we put Sem Levinp209completely naked into a room whose temperature could be exactly controlled . We dropped it lower and lower . After eight hours ' exposurewe discharged him and he returned to the cage filled with nondescript Jews . At first he merely dressed and talked with them . Later , when he joined them blue with cold , two fat middle-aged Jewish women began caring for him . They took his frozen body and held it between them , as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare piled them over the three Jews , the two fat women and shivering Sem Levin . " I grew to hate this tough little Jew , because each time he entered that room he announced quietly , I am still alive . ' And when he said this , the Jews cheered , no matter what we had done to them that day . I am still alive . ' Now it became with them a matter of honor to keep him alive . They saved food for him . Massaged him . Stole medicine for him . And from their resolve he too became determined not to die . " No man could have withstood what he withstood . He 'd come back to the cage with his dirty little penis shriveled up and blue , and he 'd say , I am still alive . ' And the fat women , remembering their husbands dead somewhere in Germany , would take him in their arms . " It was at this point , when pneumonia was about to begin , that he started greeting me each morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Herr Professor . I am still alive . ' " Stiglitz leaned against the pillar , weak with horror . Then he said in ghost-like voice well suited to the silent room , " And all the time my filthy wife was going to bed with anyone who had a little authority . " He looked at me with the beseeching face a man uses when he is beyond personal salvation and asks help of a priest or a rabbi . In a kind of wail he protested , " But I was honest about the experiment . I could have killed Sem Levin any time I wished , and silenced that speech : I am still alive . ' No , I held rigorously to the schedule as planned . We lowered the degrees day by day . My records will show that . . . exactly as planned . " Much later than anyone would have dared predict , this dirty little Jew "  --  ten minutes ago he had been a fine human being  --   | " contracted pneumonia . He should have died . By all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow infusedlife into him . All that I took away they gave back . On the last three days he could scarcely make his voice heard , but he rasped , Good morning , Herr Professor . I am still alive . ' " Finally we broke him . Would you believe it , Miller , he spent three days stark naked in a room two degrees above zero , your system . " Neither of us spoke . Then , in a wild rage , he shouted , " That 's why , you stupid American , I could not make the decision yesterday . John Pritchard would have refused to live if we had left him there . If Sem Levin could refuse to die , why could n't Pritchard refuse to live ? Tell me that , Mr. Know-it-all . " " What happened ? " I asked in unconcealed horror . " He died . Two full weeks after we had predicted . . fourteen days . . . he died . The man in charge was so infuriated with the fat women that he sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I shouted . " Say it . Where ? " " Away , " he repeated dully . Then quickly : " I do n't know where he sent them . He signed the order . . . the other man . " " Stiglitz , " I said quietly , trying to keep control of myself , " you 're lying . " " No , no , Herr Miller . It was he who signed the order . " " You 're lying , " I repeated , not moving . " No , before God , he signed the order . For Sem Levin I was responsible . That I admit . The records will prove my guilt regarding him . But the others . . . " " Stiglitz ! " I screamed , driven to my feet by an impulse outside me . " I am a Jew ! " He stared at me in awful disbelief , then drew back against the pillar . He tried to laugh , as if I were joking . He moved his mouth to speak but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protection . " Herr Miller . . . " he gasped weakly . " I 'm going to kill you , " I threatened , making a lunge at him , but he used the pillar adroitly to protect himself , and I did not touch him.  |p211In  the large room there was no furniture , no weapon of any kind except the knife he had used for scraping away the plaster . It had been left lying on the earth near where I stood , but I did n't see it . To my surprise , Stiglitz left the protection of the pillar and made a lunge at me . I felt I could handle him , although he was heavier than I , and I got set to tackle him head on , but my preparation was useless , because he had no interest in me . With a swoop , he fell on the knife and leaped to his feet , jubilant . " I 'm going to kill you , " I repeated slowly . " For Sem Levin and the others in the cage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hands before his chest , and I made a strong feint to the right , then a drive to the left , aiming a kick at his groin . I caught him well and sent him down in a screaming heap , with the useless knife still held before his chest . Had there been a chair in the room , I would have killed him then , beating him to death , but since I had only my hands , I refrained from leaping on him . Instead , I started kicking at him savagely as he lay huddled on the floor . Then , with a second feint at his head , I drove in with a powerful kick at his stomach , straightening him out and sending the knife softly into the dust . I made a football lunge at him and caught his throat in my hands . I was about to strangle him when the great door of the serai creaked open , admitting daylight and a tall Afghan . With a deep voice he asked in Pashto , " Who would fight in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark-faced man with mustaches and a flowing turban . Across his chest were bandoleers and in his belt a silver-handled dagger . " Who would fight in a serai ? " he repeated . " There was no reason , " I replied in Pashto , scrambling to my feet . " Good , " he cried , and with a deft kick of his booted foot spun our knife against the wall , where it fell quietly to earth . Recovering it , he jammed it into his belt beside his own and said , " The knife I1 will keep . " As he spoke , other men began filing into the fort and finally a woman , tall and stalwart , with bangles in her nose and no chaderi.  |p212Then  I recognized who the intruders were : the Povindahs I had seen at Ghazni , and this tall man with the two daggers was the one whom Nur and I had met that day on horseback . He seemed to recognize me too , for he turned away and strode to the door , where he issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , additional men appeared bearing bits of wood and utensils , which they carried to the center of the room , where a substantial fire was started . When it was well ablaze , with smoke drifting out a hole in the ceiling , three Povindah women marched in with that wild , matchlessgait I had admired in Ghazni . They were dressed in good gray blouses and black skirts , and since they passed close to me and wore no chaderies , I stared at them and found them handsome . . . not beautiful in any way but handsome . After they had taken their places about the fire another Povindahentered , and she was not only handsome ; she was bewitching , a saucy pigtailed girl of seventeen or eighteen , dressed in red skirt and pink blouse . We looked at each other , and I recognized her as the girl chasing the goat at Ghazni , and I saw that in her nose she wore no bangles and that her face was extremely clean and sensitive . She kept looking at me as she moved toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized me , and the grace of her movement reminded me of the gazelles , who could twist and turn at any moment , and so we stared at each other until the man with the bandoleers cried roughly , " Mira ! " And the girl went to him for instructions which I did not hear . She either did not understand what the leader directed or she thought his words unwise , for she stood perplexed , whereupon he gave her a shove and cried , " Mira , do as I say . " He propelled her from the serai and I had to assume that he was angry with her for having paraded before me , but I was wrong . For soon she appeared at the door bringing with her a most beautiful young woman with blond hair , fair complexion and sparkling blue eyes . She was obviously not a Povindah , even though she was dressed as one in black skirt and bracelets . It hadp213to be Ellen Jaspar  --  tanned from long hours of marching in the sun , slim , vibrant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall now what I had expected Ellen to look like : vaguely , I had supposed she would be brittle , or obviously neurotic , or reticent with an overt fear of sex , or generally odd-ball like the typical college girl who reacts negatively to the world . She was none of these . Not a single cliche of the sterile revolutionarywas visible in this unmarked , wonderful face , and I could hear Richardson of Intelligence saying in the embassy : I 'd date that one . She 's stunning . Then I understood why her husband , when I had asked him on the desert if she were in Afghanistan , had looked first to the easternand western stars , judging from them that it was the season when his wife would return to this country with the march of the nomads . Any man who had ever known Ellen Jaspar would keep in his mind a schedule of her movements . It was to this band of Povindahs that she had run away , and I stepped forward to introducemyself and to tell her that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she nodded slightly , as if she already knew who I was , and hurried past me to where Dr. Stiglitz remained in a dazed condition on the ground . I remember clearly that her lips started to form a word , then stopped . On her second attempt she cried , " Dr. Stiglitz ! " He looked up , saw who it was , and more or less collapsed , hiding his face from what he could scarcely believe . She knelt beside him , took his hands and gently pulled him from the ground . " Are you all right ? " she asked . " Madame Nazrullah , I ca n't believe . . . " Having restored him to his feet , she left him abruptly and came to me , her blond hair peeking from beneath an embroidered Asian cap . Standing before me she said graciously , " I 'm Ellen Jaspar , and you must be Mark Miller from the American embassy . " " How did you know ? " I asked in some confusion . " Our people followed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some strange way her composure made me feel out of place , and I did n't know what to say . " I 'm glad to find you alive , " I fumbled . She suppressed a smile and said , " The savages have treated me rather well . " Then she moved to the side of the tall leader and linked her arm with his in one of those automatic gestures which can not be explained but which betray everything . . . only a woman who is living with a man ever makes that particular movement . Ellen Jaspar had run off with the leader of a nomad caravan , and it must have been this improbable rumor that had reached Shah Khan in Kabul . Little wonder that he had refused to repeat it or have it attributed to him in our embassy records . " This is Zulfiqar , " Ellen announced . " Is the feud ended ? " the big nomad asked Stiglitz and me . When we nodded he cried , " Then let us eat ! " And I had my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when two Povindah boys with dartingeyes and quick gestures  --  the kind who steal you blind in a bazaar  --  came yelling that a jeep was hidden in one of the rooms . The Povindahs piled out to see the vehicle and Zulfiqar demanded , " Whose is it ? " " Mine , " I said . " Why is it here ? " I pointed to the broken axle and explained , " I hit rocks on the dasht . " " What were you doing on the dasht ? "  |p216The  Povindahs gathered round , and since Dr. Stiglitz was still unnerved by the unforeseen consequences of the pillar , I had to explainPritchard 's death in Pashto . Having done so , I began translatinginto English for Ellen , but she interrupted , in good Pashto , " I learned the language . " When we returned to our breakfast , Zulfiqar surprised me by inquiring bluntly , " Now what do you want to ask us about Ellen ? " He pronounced her name gently , in two careful syllables : El-len . I turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . how did you know who I was ? " Zulfiqar replied . " They told us in Ghazni . " " No one in Ghazni knew what I was doing , " I protested . At this Zulfiqar laughed and indicated with his thumb that Ellen was to speak . She brushed back her blond hair and chuckled . " Two minutes after you arrived in Ghazni , Mira saw you in the bazaar . " " There were no women in the bazaar at Ghazni . " " Mira is everywhere . " " Is that true of all Povindahs ? " The indulgent smile on Zulfigar 's face disappeared and he banged his extended fingertips onto the rug from which we were eating . " We 're not Povindahs ! " he exploded . " That 's an ugly name given us by the British . It means that we 're permitted "  --  his voice assumed much scorn  --  " permitted , if you will , to cross into their lands . We are the Kochis , the Wanderers , and we ask no nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established the boundaries , centuries ago ! " He subsided , but warned me quietly , " We are the Kochis . " Ellen resumed : " Mira saw you in the bazaar and sprinted back to camp to warn us that a ferangi was in town . She already knew that you were from the embassy , had a jeep , traveled with an Afghandriver who worked for the government , and that you were headed for Kandahar . Do n't ask me how she knew . " I looked at Mira , whose dark eyes were flashing satisfaction . She smiled , but said nothing.  | " When you attended the stoning of the woman , three of our men were spying on you . Later they talked with your armed guards . They found you were headed for Qala Bist , and when you hiked out to our camp at the edge of Ghazni , I watched you from the tents . " Zulfiqar smiled again and said , " She wanted to speak then , but I argued , ' No . Do n't spoil his fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Qala Bist . Find out for himself . Let him follow us across the desert . He 'll talk about it the rest of his life . ' " I was struck by his shrewdness and recalled the things I would have missed : Kandahar , the arch at Qala Bist , The City , and this caravanserai . In some way I must have betrayed my thoughts , for with a twist of his hand he imitated a man fighting with a knife and observed , " A caravanserai at dawn , . . . who would steal this from a young man ? " I looked at Zulfiqar with new respect and reminded him , " You offered to answer my questions . Why is Miss Jaspar here ? " With no resentment he explained . " Last September we camped for three days at Qala Bist . On our way to winter quarters at Jhelum . And this American woman came out from the fort to visit with our children . . . with our women . She spoke some Pashto and our people talked . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Jhelum . She asked by what route , and they told her Spin Baldak , Dera Ismail Khan , Bannu , Nowshera , Rawalpindi . As we were leaving she came to me and said , I 'd like to travel with your caravan ! ' I asked her why , and she replied . . . " " I said , " Ellen interrupted in Pashto , " that I would like to march with the free people . " I turned to Ellen and asked in English , " Is he married ? " In Pashto she replied , so that all the nomads could hear , " It seems I can love only married men . " Then she pointed to one of the handsome older women and said , " That 's Racha , Mira 's mother . " It was thus made obvious to all what my English question had been , and thus I began my acquaintance with Ellen Jaspar in irritation and embarrassment.  |p218The  older woman , with a golden bangle in her nose , bowed gracefully , and I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years older than Ellen Jaspar , but she makes me feel like an infant . I remember that as I finished this thought , I happened to look across the rug and saw that Mira was smiling at my confusion . When we finished eating , Zulfiqar asked Ellen in Pashto , " Is the fat one a doctor ? " Ellen replied that he was , and Zulfiqar said , " Ask him if he 'd look at some of our people . " Ellen said , " Ask him yourself . He speaks Pashto . " " I 'd be happy to help , " Stiglitz volunteered , eager to reestablish himself after the fight at the pillar . Zulfiqar announced , " The doctor will look at your sores , " and the Kochis lined up to show him torn fingers , scarred legs and teeth that should have been yanked earlier . As I watched Stiglitz work , I was again impressed by his skill in handling sick people and I was torn between admiring him as a doctor and hating him for what he had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to revive his hope that in spite of last night I might still recommend his employment by our embassy . Once he looked at me with a halfsmileand asked in English , " For a people without doctors , the Kochis are quite healthy , are n't they ? They get along very well without doctors . " I felt it unnecessary for me to put him completely at ease , so I ignored the question and had started toward the door when I was met by a travesty of a nomad , one of the funniest-looking men I ever saw . He was about five feet three , scrawny , unshaved , dirty , and clothed in the grimiest rags imaginable . He wore his filthy turban with one end almost to his knees and grinned through broken teeth and a left eye that had a scar dropping three inches from the corner to his jawbone . He shuffled along in sandals that almost fell from his feet and nodded obsequiously to all . He had been bitten by something , and showed his left arm to Dr. Stiglitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That damned camel ! " the man railed , spitting between his black teeth.  | " Looks like you 've been chewed , " Stiglitz mused , looking at the ugly , extended wound . " This is Maftoon , " Ellen explained . " He tends the camels . What happened , Maftoon ? " " That damned camel ! " the little man repeated . " He has great trouble with the beasts , " Ellen laughed . She spoke rapidly with Maftoon and he nodded . " One of the camels gummed his arm , " she said . " Do n't you mean bit ? " I asked . " No , I mean gummed . Camels have no upper teeth , you know . At least not in front . When they get mad at you , and Maftoon 's are always mad at him , they gum you . " " What are you talking about ? " I asked . " Come along , " she volunteered , and she took me out to the camels , where she threw bits of nan at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the food and I could see that she was right . In front the beasts had strong lower teeth but no uppers , only a broad plate of hard gum against which they bit to chew off grass or other fodder . In back , of course , they had grinding teeth . " I never heard of this , " I said , looking for a baby camel that I could inspect more closely . " Try this one , " Ellen suggested , and she called an enormous brute some nine feet tall at the hump , the female with a bad dispositionwho had attacked Maftoon and sent him to the doctor . " This old devil hates Maftoon but gets along well with me . Hey , hey ! " she called , and the huge beast came close , lowered her head , and muzzled Ellen for a piece of nan . The split upper lip opened and Ellen pressed her thumb against the hard flat gum , then threw a chunk of nan , which the camel caught . " You try it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old camel to open her mouth . The plate against which her lower teeth hit was hard as bone . " Extraordinary , " I said as the big beast ambled away , but as she did so she caught sight of little Maftoon coming from the doctor , and she began to make noises , showing her irritation . I say " make noises " but I 'm sure that is n't the right phrase : the camel uttered ap220sound that was a combination groan , growl , gurgle and grunt . And it was clear that whereas Ellen and I could inspect her teeth , Maftoonhad better stand clear . " Watch ! " Ellen whispered , as the little camel driver took off his turban and threw it on the ground . He took off his long shirt , his tattered pants , his sandals , everything until he stood quite naked . Then he moved back and waited while the embittered camel shuffledup , smelled the clothes and began kicking them violently . She bit them , stamped on them , spit at them and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had vented her spleen she stalked majestically away , gurgling and grunting . When she was gone , Maftoon recovered his clothes , dressed and went in pursuit of the placated camel . When he reached her head he scratched her neck , she gurgled amiably , and the two walked off toward the meager pasture . " What 's it all about ? " I asked . " The old camel drivers believe . . , . and it seems to work . . . that a camel bears terrible grudges . Maftoon and the old lady had a fight , and even though she gummed his arm , she 'd attack him again and again unless he allowed her to fight his clothes . She 's satisfied and tomorrow he 'll be able to load her again . " We followed the little man and his camel for some distance , then sat on rocks to watch the animals graze over land where I could see nothing . Ellen said , " I never tire of watching camels . I suppose it goes back to my Sunday school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . Goodness , that seems years ago . " My interrogation of Nazrullah had been so constantly postponedthat I was determined to learn as much as possible in my one day with the Kochis , so I launched right in : " Why wo n't you write to your parents ? " She was expecting some opening attack like this and replied easily , " What could I tell them ? " She looked at me pleasantly as the bright sun illuminated her well-scrubbed face . " If they could n't understand a simple problem like Nazrullah , how could they pos/sibly understand this ? " She pointed to Maftoon , the camels and the caravanserai . " Perhaps I could understand . " " Not likely . " She spoke with a contempt which erased the pleasantnessI had observed before . " Nazrullah is still very much in love with you . What happened ? " " He 's very kind . He 's very tedious , " she replied . I was irritated by her assumed superiority and was about to comment on it when I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spying on us , but after a while I had to conclude that he was not spying , for he seemed neither jealous nor suspicious ; he looked as if he were glad that Ellen had found a chance to talk with an American . I thought : Wonder what they talk about when they 're alone . Aloud I asked , " Can Zulfiqar read and write ? " " Books , no . Figures . . . better than either of us . " She said this in a bored manner implying that no further commentfrom me would be welcomed , so I observed , " Nazrullah seemed one of the ablest men in the country . " " He is , " she said with equal finality and equal boredom . Then with a show of real warmth she added , " His wife Karima 's even better . " " I met her . . . in chaderi . " " Karima ! She never wears chaderi if she can help it . " " I had a government official with me . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monotone . " Karima observes the custom to protect Nazrullah , and he assures the government that he approves in order to protect Karima . " It was a neatly phrased summary , but I remembered what Nazrullahhad said on the desert : On the morning after the marriage Ellen came to breakfast wearing a chaderi . Probably I should have kept my mouth shut , but she had gone out of her way to irritate and embarrass me , so I remarked , " Nazrullah told me that when you first came to Afghanistan you wore the chaderi . " She blushed angrily , blood coursing across her beautiful face . " Nazrullah talks a lot , " she said.  | " Karima talked a lot , too , " I continued . " She told me that while you were still in America you learned that Nazrullah already had a wife . " She laughed uneasily . " Why are you American men so preoccupied with such trivialities ? Of course I knew he was married . This proves , Mr. Miller , why you could never understand my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my understanding why you left Nazrullah ? " She looked at me steadily , almost insultingly , with deep blue eyes , then laughed . " No one who works for the American embassycould possibly understand . " That did it . " If you were a man , " I said coldly , " I 'd bust you in the nose . Why do n't you have the decency to tell your parents where you are ? " My bluntness shocked her and she bit her knuckles , then toyed nervously with the embroidery on her blouse . " Your question is a sensible one , Mr. Miller , and it hurts . My parents are good , decentpeople and I 'm sure they mean well . But what can I possibly write to them ? " She looked at me with the first compassion I had seen since we started talking , but it quickly faded . " Would you suggestsomething like this ? " she asked brightly , as she began reciting an imaginary letter . " Dear Mumsy and Dadsy , I have run away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on earth , and I 'm sure his other wife thinks so too . He could move right into Dorset without causing a ripple , because he believes like you , Mumsy-wumsy , that God wants men to have big cars , that electricity makes people happy , and that if you sell enough canned goods , tensions will cease . You were deadly afraid of him , Dadsy-wadsy , but you should n't have been . He 's your twin brother and if you 'd recognized a good thing when you saw it , you 'd have fought to keep him , not me . Because he could sell insurance ten times better than you ever did . Your loving daughter , EllenBryn Mawr 1945 , busted outp223p.s . I am now living with a man who has no home , no nation and no responsibility except ninety-one camels . His wife made me the most adorable gray blouse you ever saw in your life , and I 'm wearingit as I hike over the Lower Himalayas . I 'll write to you next from Jhelum when we get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me bitterly and said , " If you think that would put them at ease , send it to them . Frankly , I have n't the guts . " I was disgusted with her . She sounded like a freshman I knew at Mount Holyoke , except for two things : the other girl 's father sold stocks and bonds in Omaha , and in her sophomore year she got some sense . This Jaspar girl was irritating , and I said something which must have made me sound foolish : " When the years pass , you 'll be old . What will you do in a Kochi caravan then ? " " What will Senator Vandenberg do ? He 'll be old . And you . . what 's your first name , Miller ? " " Mark . Groton and Yale . " " That 's just dandy . If there 's anyone I like to meet in the middle of the Afghan desert it 's a Yale man . Tell me , do you honestly believe that in my home town of Dorset , Pennsylvania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a basic evil ? " " I believe that anyone does best when he clings to his own nation , his own people . . and his own religion . I understand you gave yours up . " " Presbyterianism is not difficult to give up , " she replied . " A moment ago I said to myself , She sounds like a Mount Holyoke freshman . I put you about four years too high . You sound like a high-school freshman . " " Damn you ! " she snapped . " I 'm sitting here among the camels thinking : That poor dear boy , Mark Miller . Groton and Yale . The years will pass and he 'll be stuck in some pothole like the embassy in Brussels . And he 'll be old . And he 'll have missed the whole meaning . . . the whole goddamned meaning . " She looked at me sadly and said , " You 're a young jerk and you 're already prematurelymiddle-aged and I 'm terribly sorry for you . " ' I stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justp224stared at her . Finally she shrugged her shoulders and said , " I surrender , . Get me some paper . I 'll write the letter . " I asked her if she would come inside , but she replied , " I never get enough of this free air , " and as I entered the caravanserai to get some paper from my brief case I met Zulfigar and told him , " She 's going to write to her parents , " and he replied , " I asked her to , months ago . " I handed her the paper and she sat scrunched up on the rocks , biting my pen . Then , as she started writing freely and easily , I had a second chance to study her . If I had n't just heard her bittercomments , I would have sworn that she was exactly what I had guessed when I first saw her in the caravanserai : a lovelier , more beautiful , more delightful person than we had seen in the embassy photographs . She simply did not look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plenitude of charm , and if I could have erased her recent conversationI could easily have agreed with her enthusiastic roommate , whose report I now recalled so clearly : Ellen Jaspar was a dear , sweet kid . She was loyal , responsive , and trustworthy . It sounded like the Girl Scout oath , but now Ellen came to a difficult part of her letter and a scowl crossed her face  --  a harsh , belligerent scowl  --  and I could not possibly kid myself into thinking that I was dealingwith any Girl Scout . " Will that do ? " she asked , thrusting the finished letter at me . I took it , turned away from the bright sunlight , and read : Dear Folks , I 'm terribly sorry I have n't written sooner , but some rather dramaticthings have been happening and frankly , I found it almost impossible to explain them to you in a letter . Let me say quickly that they leave me happier than I have ever been , in better spirits , secure in all things . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work out too well , but it was not because of his unkindness . He was an even better man than I told you , and I am terribly sorry to have hurt him , but there was no escape . I am now with some wonderful people whom you would like , and I 'll tell you all about them later.  |p225To  show you how crazy this world can be , I am now sitting with a herd of camels on the edge of the desert talking to a perfectly delightful Yale man , Mark Miller , who will send you a fuller letterof his own explaining all that has happened . He will tell you that I am happy , healthy and alive . Your loving daughter . . . Thinking of my own close-knit family in Boston , I could have wept at her inability to communicate with her people . I returned the letter and said , " Sign it , and I 'll airmail it from Kandahar . " But before writing her signature she let the pen hang idly and mused , " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am happy , healthy and alive . And if I were to grow old as pleasantly as Racha has done , I 'd be content . " She signed the letter , addressed the envelope carefully , then bit the pen for some moments . Extending the sealed letter provocativelytoward me , she waved it twice , then studiously tore it into minute bits , which she scattered among the camels . " I can not send such evasions , " she said hoarsely . We stared at each other for some time and I saw in her eyes hatred , bitterness and confusion . But as I continued to look at her , these ugly attributes vanished and I saw merely the appealing gaze of an attractive , perplexed young woman . I said , " I 'll write to them . " " Please do , " she replied . I returned to the caravanserai , where I faced one of the more difficult decisions of my mission : on the one hand I was dead tired from the long , tragic day on the desert followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole autonomic system demanded that I fall asleep ; but on the other I awaited the momentary arrival of a rescue mission led by either Nazrullah or troops from Kandahar , so that before the rescue party took me away I wanted to see as much of Kochi life as possible . I forced myself to stay awake , watching the children and the older women working at their jobs . I thought constantly : I 'm probably the only person from the Americanembassy who ever saw the Kochis close-up . I can sleep tomonow.  |p226But  when I looked at Dr. Stiglitz , spread out on the floor by the pillar , it became impossible to fight sleep any longer . I dropped on the hard-packed earth and almost immediately lost consciousness . My last memory was of Racha throwing a shawl over me . I awoke in darkness and my first thought was : Good ! If the rescueparty has n't made it by now , they wo n't come till tomorrow . I can stay with the Kochis tonight . The big room was filled with the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around which many were working . Then I became aware of someone sitting beside me , and it was Mira in her red skirt , and when I stirred she said in Pashto , " Zulfiqar told me to keep the children away . " Then in broken English she said , " Ellen tell me English few words . " She spoke in a lilting , pleasant voice that sounded as if it belonged to a younger girl , and she had a gamin smile . When I reached out to inspect her attractive pigtails , which no other Kochiswore , she smiled with pride and explained , " Ellen fix my hair American way . " She pronounced Ellen 's name as her father did , in two gentle syllables . In Pashto I asked , " Does Ellen work in the camp ? " " All work , " she replied in English , followed by Pashto : " Have you come to take Ellen away ? " " I wanted to , but she wo n't come . " " I am so glad . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We 've always known she would leave some day , " Mira replied . " Look how she works . " Ellen , not knowing that I was awake , was busy at the fire , the antagonisms of her letter lost in work . Zulfiqar had killed a sheep in honor of the ferangi and it was roasting , with Ellen in charge to see that it did n't burn . From time to time she stuck a long fork into the flanks and tasted it , smacking her lips as she did so . Children stayed close to the fire , begging her for stray pieces of mutton , as if she were their mother , while against the wall lounged Kochi men , waiting silently for the unscheduled feast . Other women were preparing pilau in stone vessels , while Dr. Stiglitzp227and Zulfiqar were opening K-rations , whose tops were promptly licked clean by other children . Except for the American cans , it was a scene that dated back to the beginning of man on the plains of Central Asia . " We eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch Ellen , relaxed and motherly , standing by the roasted sheep and passingout portions as if she had done so all her life . From time to time , with greasy hands , she brushed her blond hair back from her moist face , appearing as feminine as any woman I had ever seen , and I recalled her words from the destroyed letter : I am happy , healthy and alive . Clearly she was , and when it came time to serve me she smiled as she gave me a chunk of well-browned meat . " Be sure to try the nan , " she advised , as I helped myself to pilau . Mira led me to a rug where the leaders were sitting , and I found a place across from Dr. Stiglitz , beside whom Ellen would sit . Later , when I tasted the nan Ellen asked , " Delicious , eh ? " I replied that it had a nut-like flavor and she explained in English that it had been baked directly over dried camel dung . " Ca n't you taste it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pashto she said , " It is of the earth . It is of our life . " Zulfiqar nodded and said , " The sheep you 're eating . . . we raised . " Later I told Zulfiqar , " Ellen wrote the letter to her parents , but tore it up . " Ellen added , " Zulfiqar understands . I ca n't explain Dorset to him , nor him to Dorset . " The big Kochi chieftain said , " You write , Mil-lair . " " I will . . . tomorrow . " My mention of this word evoked a sadness , and at our rug nothing was said ; each looked at the other with a sense of strangeness . Mira broke the spell : " What will you tell her parents ? " " What should I tell them ? " I asked the group , and to my surprise it was Racha who spoke . " Tell them , " Zulfiqar 's wife said , " that now we head for the Oxusand in the winter back to the Jhelum . We live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the Oxus in your letter , " Ellen Warned . " They'llgo crazy looking for it on their maps . Correct name 's the Amup228Darya . . . about a thousand miles from the Jhelum . . and we make the round trip each year . " " Two thousand miles ? " " Each year . " " You ride the camels ? " I asked . This occasioned great laughter and Ellen explained , " Only the babies ride camels . The rest of us . . . we walk . " She indicated Zulfiqar : " He has a horse , of course , but he must ride back and forth watching the animals . " " Do you mind the walking ? " I asked . Ellen indicated her legs tucked beneath the black skirt . " They get very strong , " she assured me . " How long has your clan been making this trip to the Jhelum ? " I asked , and Ellen consulted Zulfiqar . " There is no memory , " he replied . " Where exactly is the Jhelum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India , " was Zulfiqar 's answer , which caused me to burst into laughter . The big Kochi looked at me quizzically and I explained , " At a meeting in the American embassy we were trying to guess where she might be . " I indicated Ellen , who said in English , " I 'll bet you were . " Quickly she translated the joke into Pashto , and the group laughed . " And this important officer said "  --  I imitated Richardson 's pipepuffing , self-assured style  --  " The chances of an American girl 's entering India without being noticed are just not measurable . ' " Zulfiqar chuckled . " The British ! A million of us pass back and forth each year and no one knows where we go or how we feed ourselves . " Ellen added , " We 're the wanderers who make fools of petty na-tions . " " Where are you headed now ? " I asked . " Musa Darul , Daulat Deh . . . in twenty-five days , Kabul . Bamian , Qabir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my imagination , for I had known it from boyhood days : Balkh , in ages past the greatest name in Central Asia.  | " Balkh ! " I said , and for a moment I daydreamed of how it would be to visit Balkh , but my fantasy was broken by Ellen , whose unpredictable behavior I was about to witness for the first time . Because our argument over the letter had become acrimonious , I expected her to be resentful , but to my surprise , and for reasons I could not decipher , she said quietly , " We go right to Kabul . " Zulfiqar nodded , and from something in the way he acted or from some nuance in Ellen 's speech , I received the impression that I might be welcomed on the march to Kabul . I leaned forward to broach the matter and Mira did the same , as if she were anticipatinghopefully my reaction to one of the most tenuous invitations ever extended . " You go right to Kabul ? " I repeated . No one spoke . Then Zulfiqar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send soldiers to fetch the broken jeep . " I turned to consult Dr. Stiglitz , whom I had continued to rebuff , and he said in English , hoping to win back my approval , " He 's right , Herr Miller . You should see the mountain passes . I 'll stay with the jeep . " Ellen contradicted : " You must come too , Doctor . We could use you in the caravan . " Zulfiqar leaned back and surveyed the ceiling , then asked Racha , " Could we use such a doctor at Qabir ? " Racha studied the German and nodded , whereupon Zulfiqar warned , " We wo n't reach Qabir for many weeks . Will you join us ? " Dr. Stiglitz licked his lips and replied weakly , " Yes . " At this , Zulfiqar ended consultation with the women . " You two , " he demanded of the ferangi , " how much money can you share with us ? " I had two hundred dollars Afghan and Stiglitz much less , but he pointed out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way back this autumn . . . " Zulfiqar reached out and gripped the doctor 's hand . But before the agreement was sealed I felt , for some reason I could not have explained , that it was my duty to warn Stiglitz of the risk he was taking . I led him away from the table and said , " With me it 's simple . If Verbruggen gets mad , I 'm sent home . I'llp 230gamble , because from something he said I think he 'll understand . But with you , Doctor , if you antagonize the Afghan government . . . " " I 'm a sick man , Herr Miller , " he said weakly . " You know how sick I am . Unless I can find a rebirth . . . " " You could be thrown out of the country , " I warned . " You know what that would mean . " " Unless I can purify myself . . " You 're placing a great burden on the Kochis , " I pointed out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will use me as I will use him . " " I wonder what he meant , Could we use him at Qabir ? " " I do n't know , " the German replied . " But I must make this trip . It will be my salvation . " And we rejoined the others . As we did so , Mira came to me and said , in the dying light of the fire , " The Kochis would like you to join us , Miller . " Then in Englishshe added , " I like it too . " " I 'm going to , " I said . We sat as a group by the embers and I repeated the story of the pillar , to which Ellen responded , " That 's no surprise . One more outragein a long series . " Zulfiqar inspected the exposed skull and others satisfied themselves that bodies were immured in the pillar , but no one seemed perturbed . At bedtime I had my first doubts : Suppose Nazrullah arrives with the rescue party ? I 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets back from Hong Kong ? This could finish me with the State Department . Suppose Shah Khan makes an official protest ? I 'd be packed out like the two Marines . Then I heard Zulfiqar 's powerful voice announcing , " We will move forward at four in the morning . " Somehow this set my mind at rest . Nazrullah was not going to intercept me , and once I started north with the Kochis , it did n't matter what the ambassador and Shah Khan thought . They could n't do a damned thing about it till I reached Kabul . I was awakened by the fearful clatter of Kochis preparing to launch their caravan for another day . Protesting camels werep231loaded with trade stuffs . Black tents were struck and folded . Animalsin the courtyard were herded onto the trail , and children were assigned tasks to which they attended promptly to avoid stout blows from Zulfiqar . If I had ever thought of nomads as lazy , such ideas were dispelled that morning . As we were about to leave the serai I recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to others where he had been and what he had accomplished , and it occurredto me that I ought to extend him the same courtesy , so I scribbled a brief note stating simply that I had found his wife in good health and that I was hiking to Kabul with a caravan of Kochis . Would he advise our ambassador ? " That 'll give the old man something to chew on when he gets back , " I chuckled , but when I told Zulfiqar what I was about to do he went suddenly pale  --  I mean he turned almost white  --  and ordered me to stay where I was while he went to consult the leaders . Sometime later he returned , badly shaken , and asked me to redraft the note omitting any reference to Kochis . I did so , and he asked Ellen to read it , but she could scarcely keep from laughing . She said cryptically , " It 's accomplished its purpose , " but he asked for further minor changes and at last I carried it with a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the steering wheel . In darkness we started our journey north , an ageless caravan heading across an ageless land . In the lead , with checkered vest and French overcoat , rode Zulfiqar on his brown horse , complete with dagger , German rifle and leather bandoleer . On the camels rode several infants and one sick woman in her late fifties . The rest walked , slowly , comfortably , tending the sheep or keeping the ninety-one camels in line . Donkeys burdened with panniers chugged along , and behind them marched Ellen 7aspar , wearing stout armytypeshoes , and Mira , in sandals . The busiest person in line was jagged-eyed Maftoon , flapping back and forth along his string of camels , checking the ugly beasts to be sure their burdens were riding properly . I was to discover that during each day 's hike , some one of the camels was outraged at Maftoon and made his frenzied life miserable : the ugly beastp232would not rise , would not lie down , would stray from the caravan , would fight and gurgle and protest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his camels in line . At dawn the sun made Ellen 's blond hair shine like gold , and she knew she was a beauty among the dark Kochis , for she carriedherself with dignity . She had developed a healthy stride and her broad shoulders swung in the morning sunlight ; but she was not alone in her beauty , for beside her with matching stride and jet-black hair hiked Mira , daughter of the chief and a notable personin her own right . She sensed instinctively when I watched her , and this pleased her , for occasionally I would catch her whisperingto Ellen and pointing at me . A day 's trip was about fourteen miles . Except in the desert , where all travel had to be at night , we walked from pre-dawn till about noon , stopping at predetermined spots to which the Kochis had been returning for years , and this pitching and striking of tents became the dominant beat of the day 's rhythm . I volunteered to help with the camels , for the preposterous brown beasts continued to fascinate me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flopping jaws that seemed to lack all terminal attachments . Once , when I was observing the frowsy old female who had attackedMaftoon , it occurred to me that the forlorn beast with the droopy eyes looked exactly like my Aunt Rebecca in Boston . I could hear her whining as I left for Afghanistan , " Mark , be careful . Find yourself a nice Jewish girl . " Like the camel , Aunt Rebecca uncovered an endless supply of things to complain about , her eyes were jaundiced , and she chewed sideways . If she had had a coat of hair , I 'm sure it would have been as bedraggled as the camel 's . It was uncanny how much alike they were , and I was fond of them both . I started calling the camel " Aunt Becky , " and she responded in a way that infuriated Maftoon . She would nip at him , bump him , cry bitterly when he approached her , then turn to me and be as docile as an indulgent old woman . I made her my special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My legs grew strong . I acquired a good tan and my sleep was un/broken . My appetite was unbelievable and I had never felt better . I thought : No wonder Ellen joined the Kochis . But any illusions I had about the nomads as noble savages were dispelled on the sixth day , when we reached the outskirts of the little bazaar town of Musa Darul , for as soon as we struck camp six Kochis and four camels , including Aunt Becky , headed for town and in due course returned with an unprecedented supply of melons , meats , shoes and other necessities . That day we had a choice lunch and all would have been well , except that in midafternoonDr . Stiglitz approached me while I was talking with Mira , and pleaded in a begging manner : " I 'm hungry for tobacco . This empty pipe drives me crazy . When you mail your report to Kabul , could you get me a little at the bazaar ? I have no money . " I repliedthat after my nap I would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassy , then wandered through the bazaar , seeking parcels of tobacco , and an old Afghan said , " I know I had some right here , but I must have misplaced it , " and I was about to leave empty-handed when I was overtaken by a thin , ingratiating Afghan who spoke a little English . " Sahib , you got car ? " In Pashto I replied that I did not , whereupon the salesman assuredme , " I have a bargain you ca n't resist , sahib . You owe it to yourself . " " What is it ? " " Wait till you see , " he whispered , taking my arm and leading me to the stall of an accomplice . There , amid karakul caps and fabrics from India , were six relatively new automobile tires . " Quite something , eh ? " he asked admiringly . I was startled by the tires . How could they have reached Musa Darul ? Then off to one side I spotted a jeep carburetor , an oil filter , a jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be removed from a jeep frame . There was even a steering wheel , to which was attached my letter to Nazrullah . " Where 'd you get these ? " I asked . " Just came in this afternoon , " he said happily . " From Russia . " " You 've got a bargain here , " I assured him , as I ticked off somep234twenty separate items which I knew were going to be charged against my salary in Kabul . " But you may have to wait some time for a customer , " I warned him . He laughed and said , " Five weeks , six weeks . If nobody wants them , we 'll ship it all to Kabul . " I winced as I thought of myself wandering through that bazaar , buying back these useful items . " You send them to Kabul , " I said with resignation . " Somebody'llbe sure to need them . " I stormed back to camp and the first person I met was Ellen Jaspar . " These damned crooks ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal my jeep . . . piece by piece . " Ellen tried to control her laughter but could n't . " What did you think they wanted , your charm ? " she chided . " Did you know what they were up to ? " I asked in outrage . " Did n't you ? " she countered . " Remember the panic you caused when you said you were tying the note to the steering wheel ? Did n't you see me laughing at Zulfiqar , who tricked you to stay inside ? Miller , when you started for the jeep , the steering wheel was already packed . . . on Aunt Becky . " I felt humiliated . " You mean they stole my jeep and hid it on my own camel ? " " Miller , you should have seen those Kochis unpacking the wheels off Aunt Becky and propping them back onto the jeep until you tied the letter to the wheel . " " It 's going to cost me a month 's salary , " I said ruefully . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't protest to Zulfiqar . Strictly speaking , what he did was a breach of honor and he 's ashamed . No man should be robbed in a caravanserai . " I was about to raise hell when Mira came in to hand me something . It was three packs of smoking tobacco . " I got them at the bazaar . . . for doctor . " I looked at Ellen and asked , " How did she get them at the bazaar ? She has no money . " Ellen replied , " Mira is very quick . "  |p235I  was deflated by my discovery that the Kochis had invited me to Kabul merely to steal the wheels off my jeep , but I soon forgot my irritation . For one thing , after Musa Darul the terrain became more interesting , since we were heading up the Helmand valley , which would ultimately deposit us near Kabul , a valley that few foreigners had seen . It lay west of the barren plains of Ghazni and east of the towering Koh-i-Baba mountains . No roads traversed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barest of trails . As we hiked , I grew to appreciate Nazrullah 's complaint about the goats of Asia , for weeks passed and we saw not a single tree inp236what seemed otherwise almost virgin territory . Once great forests had covered these hills ; there were historical records of that fact ; but slowly the goats and the greed of men had denuded even the remote plateaus , leaving only rocky bleakness . I often wondered how our sheep existed as they plodded from one barren pasture to the next , but like the hungry camels , they usually found something . In our caravan there were about two hundred Kochis , and on the march we were strung out over several miles , with camels and sheep predominant , so it was Zulfiqar 's responsibility , as inheritor of this clan , to ride constantly back and forth , supervising our progress . He offered a striking appearance : tall and dark , with heavy mustaches , and a rifle to maintain his authority . On the trail he wore a white turban , but his conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew that keeping his people contented was half the battle ; he kept his mouth shut to cultivatethe legend that he knew more than his followers . When the Kochis had served me roast sheep at the caravanserai , I did not appreciate how special the meal was , for the nomads ate poorly . At breakfast we had hot tea and a slab of nan , on which we hiked for twelve or fourteen miles , after which we had a meagerhelping of pilau lacking meat . In the evening we had curds and a little nan with some shreds of meat , if any was available . We lived close to the poverty level and seemed to thrive on it , but the children were perpetually hungry . I worried about this until Ellen pointed out , " They do n't have protruding bellies . They 're wonderful specimens , " and I had to agree that what little they got nourished them , but I also noticed they were starved for fat and would avidly lick up any scraps , even if they had fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kochis were dirty ; they were unkempt ; and they made no attempt to develop intellectual interests . The wild free life of the wanderer left much to be desired . The baggy trousers and flapping white shirts of the Kochi men were rarely clean , while the felt skirts of the women were apt top237be streaked with dirt and tangled with briars , which they ignored . They washed infrequently , but I must admit that the extreme drynessof the air prevented offensive odors from accumulating . In my own case , with the humidity at two or three I could wear a shirt for more than a week because nothing could happen to it except a downright accident : there was no soot to soil the cloth and it was anatomically impossible for perspiration to collect . The minute it appeared it evaporated . I suspected that many Kochi garments were worn for months at a time without washing ; only thus could they have become as dirty as they did . The slovenliness of the Kochis was principally shown in the way they managed their hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flapped with any vigorous movement . Their heads , men 's and women 's alike , were actually matted and probably worse . I often thought how much fun it would be to run the whole clan through a barber shop some afternoon to see what surprises would turn up . As for the life of the mind , the speculation about good and evil , the judgment of past and future , there was none . Since they could neither read nor write , and since there was no radio , conversation was limited to the chance events of the caravan : the birth of sheep , the straying of a camel , the long march , outwitting the borderguards and who stole what at the last bazaar . Days sped into months and months into years without any extension of the group intellect . It may be that the Kochis were supremely happy in their rough adaptation to nature ; I often found them boring , and I had the ungenerous suspicion that Ellen Jaspar found comfort in the caravan partly because against their illiteracy she could stand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I noticed how often she came to Stiglitz or me to escape the dullness of the Kochis and to talk philosophically with an educated person . There were two exceptions to this tradition of dirtiness , slovenlinessand apathy : Zulfiqar and his daughter Mira were alert mentallyand far above average in cleanliness , largely due to Ellen , who cut Zulfiqar 's hair and tended his clothes .. As to Mira , she kept her/self well groomed partly because Ellen gave her instruction and partly because she mimicked whatever Ellen did in the way of cleanliness or personal adornment . She owned several changes of costume : red dress , blue dress , gray felt dress ; blue , red , white , green blouses ; filmy gray , brown and white turbans ; and an extra pair of sandals that she wore only when heading for some village bazaar off the caravan trail . Best of all , she had acquired a stout comb with which she managed her black hair and a washrag which she applied to her clear and even skin . Her face was brown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so black that in comparison her face looked more creamy white than brown . On the trail I often walked with Mira , whose job it was to help mind the sheep , which represented a large proportion of the Kochi wealth , and to swing along beside her as she chattered in Pashto or broken English was delightful . I tried repeatedly to fathom her narrowworld and soon discovered that she knew nothing of history or other school subjects and had no desire to learn . But she did not share the apathy of the other Kochis , for she knew much about Central Asia and in all matters affecting the Kochis was an expert . Skilled in trading , witty in negotiation , and a master in the care of animals , she confessed a major sorrow : her clan had but one horse , and it was assigned to Zulfiqar . " A man like you should not walk with the rest of us , " she told me . " In your own country you would be a chief . " I asked her not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a jeep , which in some ways was better than a horse . She considered this for a moment , then concluded , " Where we go a horse is better . " " Do n't worry . I like to walk . " " A chief ought to have his own horse . Look at my father ! Would he be so powerful without a horse ? " But if there were disappointments in nomad life there were also congenial surprises and none was more appealing than Maftoon , the cockeyed cameleer . We had marched five days toward Musa Darul when I happened to see a camel halted for no reason that I . could ascertain . I therefore started across the meadowland to re/trieve the beast when I saw , crouched down between her hind legs , Maftoon , with turban awry , mouth open , and on his face an expression of almost heavenly bliss . With his right hand on the camel'steat , he was squirting a flow of milk directly from the udder into his mouth , drinking at the rate of about a quart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maftoon ? " I shouted . " Hungry , " he said , halting the flow of milk and looking at me with his good eye . " Get up ! That milk 's for the babies . " He made no effort to leave his lunch , so I added , " And by the way , Maftoon , I 've found out why Aunt Becky tries to bite you so much . You abuse her . " The little man stayed crouched between the camel 's legs and looked at me with an expression of sorrow and disgust . " I abuse that beast ? " he stammered . " Yes ! " I insisted . " I 've listened to you the last three mornings . It 's a wonder she did n't gum your arm again . " " You listened . . . to what ? " " To Aunt Becky , complaining of the way you overload her , mistreat her . Damn it all , Maftoon , get away from that camel and listen to me . " Reluctantly the little Kochi left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to my surprise laughed at me . " Tomorrow , " he said , " you 'll load Aunt Becky . " With that he left . Next morning I was routed out of bed by the little cameleer and taken to where his beasts were being loaded . Aunt Becky , one of the largest animals we had , still rested on the thick callus built up on her chest , her pedestal it was called , and she was loath to leave it , but when she saw that I was to load her , and not her enemy Maftoon , she seemed as happy as a mournful , droopy-eyed , coatsheddingcamel could ; but as soon as I placed the first blanket on her  --  it must have weighed about three-quarters of a pound  --  she let out a sob that would have broken the heart of Nero . It was almosthuman , a wail of protest against the harshness of the world . I slapped her muzzle , and placed on the blanket a few items that she could hardly have felt , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like my own Aunt Becky back in Bos/ton , complaining of the Irish politicians , the Italian grocers , the Jewish merchants , and the ingratitude of her family . " How can I possibly bear this awful burden ? " Becky the camel sobbed . No matter what I put on her back , the groans increased , and when she was burdened much more lightly than she had been when running over the desert with my jeep , she struggled to her ungainly feet as if this were her last day on earth ; for me she would make that extra little effort and then collapse in a heap before my eyes . I gave her a slap and felt more kindly toward Maftoon . At eleven that morning Aunt Becky was striding along the trail with as much joy as a camel ever exhibits and gave me a pleasant nuzzle as I went past . The next morning Maftoon summoned me again , and this time as soon as I approached Aunt Becky she became apprehensive that I was about to torture her once more , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had barely touched her when she began to rage in protest : " Oh , this is more than a poor camel can bear ! " she seemed to say . A stranger listening from a distance would have sworn that I was pushing hot swords into her great bulk , and this kept up all during the loading ; so on the third morning I said to Maftoon , " Let 's see how much this ugly beast can carry . " And this day we loaded her down with well over eight hundred pounds . Her protests were exactly the same ; her reluctance to rise identical ; and her loping , carefree performance on the trail no different from before . In fact , once we got her started , it was hard to stop her . She loved the heft of the burden and again nuzzled me as I went by . After this indoctrination I decided to leave the camels to Maftoon , and it was well that I did , for when it came time to unloadAunt Becky her dim brain remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maftoon . Luckily he escaped , but soon I saw him naked before the camel while she attackedhis clothes . When he was dressed he warned me , " Miller Sahib ! You better undress ! " I laughed at the suggestion , but as I approached the huge camel she started for me . Maftoon interceded and , since he had made his peace , saved me . Prudently I undressed and stood by while Aunt Becky kicked the very devil out of my clothes . She bit them , spatp241on them , and even urinated a little . The next morning we were friends again . Caravan life provided moments of pride and arrogance : as dawn was breaking we would reach some rise in the trail from which we could look down upon a sleeping village , where dogs would spot us and begin to bark . A few men would appear to see what had agitated the dogs and , seeing the Kochis coming to town , would signal their neighbors , whereupon the villagers would rush about in a frenzy , moving indoors anything that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grab their children lest they be kidnaped , and families would remain cautiouslyby doorways as women stared through veils waiting for the approaching nomads . An excited hush would fall over the village , at whose outskirts the first Kochi camels were already sniffing . At such entries Zulfiqar rode at the head of the column , a handsomefigure with his rifle slung insolently across his pommel . He affectednot to see the frightened families and ignored the pestilent dogs . Behind him came the lumbering camels , with Aunt Becky thrusting her big , inquisitive face from side to side , followed by a large group of Kochi men ; then the sheep and most of the women ; finally the donkeys , the children , and the rear guard of armed men . It was an impressive caravan when seen in the close confines of a village street , but what outraged the villagers , men and women alike , was the brazen manner in which our nomad women marched handsomely forward with no chaderi . When Zulfiqar 's clan moved through a village we had with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ellen Jaspar , obviously not a Kochi ; there was Dr. Stiglitz , and what was he doing in such a motley group ; and there was the young American who marched with the beautiful nomad girl in the red dress . Several times infuriated mountain mullahs dashed among us to spit at Ellen as they had done at Kandahar , but she had since learned to ward them off indulgently . She understood the moral and mental pressures these fanatics were experiencing in a changing world and she wished to do nothing that would exasper/ate them , but if Zulfigar saw them coming , he patiently cut them off with his horse , whereupon the long-robed mullahs would back against some mud-walled house and curse our passing . When the villagers tried to abuse Stiglitz or me they got a sharp surprise : we swore at them in Pashto , claimed to be light-skinned Kochis , and warned them to mind their own business . Sometimes they stopped dead and stared at us , whereupon we laughed and they laughed . Braver men among them would run beside us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would confess that we were German and American , and the animosity would vanish . Occasionally some young man in the village who wanted to comprehend his world would march with us for miles , even to our camp , asking a hundred questions . Such men became our friends , and even if I had not mailed my report to Kabul , these inquisitivemen would have got the message to our ambassador , by word of mouth from one village to the next until it crossed Afghanistan . It was such a rumor that had reached Shah Khan in Kabul : " Traveling with the Kochis is a blond ferangi . " We had reached the halfway spot on our march to Kabul when we came upon an especially pathetic village , where I had a chance to see for myself the gentler side of Ellen Jaspar 's honest concern with human problems . It was not yet dawn as we moved down the main street , glaring back at frightened faces which peered at us through darkness , and Ellen whispered , " It does my heart good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I agree . I get a positive bang out of marching through a village like this . " " Just think ! " she cried with real intellectual excitement . " In a few years Afghanistan will destroy prisons like this "  --  she indicated the tight-barred houses  --  " and the country will go back to the ancient freedom of the caravan . " I should have allowed the subject to drop , but I was struck by a fundamental contradiction in her thinking : the idea that freedomcould be preserved only by turning back the clock . I could hear her arguing with Nazrullah at the site of the future dam :  |p243It  's a shame that the river must lose its freedom , refusing to realize that only when the river was harnessed and used could Afghanistanknow the real freedom of release from poverty . Therefore I said , " I 'm afraid you have it backwards , Ellen . Afghanistan will never gain a single freedom by reverting to the caravan . It will save itself by generating true freedom in the villages . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roads , books , Nazrullah 's electricity . " " Oh , Miller ! " she cried passionately . " You misunderstand historyand the nature of man . We are born free , like the nomads . But step by step we insist upon crawling into little prisons on little streets in mean little villages . We must destroy these prisons and restore the nomad spirit . " " I 'm sorry , Ellen . What you want is impossible . What we must do is go into the villages and rebuild them on a basis of freedom . We must go forward . We ca n't go back . " " But in Pennsylvania , my father is the village . In Afghanistan these surly people are the village . Will books and electricity cure my father . . . or these clods ? " " Only books and electricity can do it . " She stopped in the middle of the road , pressed her right hand to her mouth , and weighed my arguments . Light from one of the houses , reflecting on her bracelets , flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered generously , " in part you 're right , but you forget that men like my father . . . " I was not allowed to hear her rebuttal , for out of the shadows darted a pretty little girl of nine or ten , less fearful than her elders . Running through the darkness , she caught Ellen 's hand and cried in Pashto , " Your bracelets are beautiful . " With a gesture of instinctivewarmth , Ellen caught the child , swung her in the air , kissed her , and held her in her left arm while she took off one of her bracelets to give the child . It was a moment I can not forget . There in an alien street , beset by enmity , Ellen cradled the child in timeless pose : a lovely young mother holding in the darkness a child who intuitively trusted her ; and I was forced to recall Karima as she said : Ellen knew thatp244I could have children and apparently she could n't . Dr. Stiglitz will confirm that . I wondered if this were true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential barrenness of spirit ? My reflections were shattered by the agonizing shriek of the child 's mother , who burst upon us screaming , " The Kochis have stolen my child ! " This was a signal for villagers , long trained to repulse such thefts , to rush at us from many sides , and there was fighting . But what stunned me was the arrival of six or eight determined women in chaderies , moving swiftly through the darkness like avenging furies . Their shadowy forms engulfed Ellen as they tore at her hair , her clothes , her face . One thin figure in a gray chaderi swept in like a ferret and grabbed the child . Seeing that the little girl held a contaminated bracelet , the thin figure tore it from the child 's hands and threw it back at Ellen . " Do n't steal our children ! " a voice of passion warned . The avengers withdrew , but from the shadows came a gaunt , bearded man rushing belatedly to the brawl and hissing hatred . " Whores ! Whores ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to spit at Ellen . Zulfiqar had seen the mullah coming and had deftly swung his horse across the man 's trajectory to drive him away . The mullah followed at a distance , screaming impotently ; and thus we left the frightened villagers , who remained in excited groups , congratulatingeach other on having once more thwarted the Kochi kidnapers . Zulfiqar , concerned over Ellen 's welfare , dismounted to assure himself that all was well , and she buried her head in his shoulder , sniffling , " All I wanted to do was give the little girl a bracelet . " " How did it start ? " the big Kochi asked indulgently . " Miller and I were having a peaceful argument . . . " " About what ? " " I claimed that originally Afghanistan knew the freedom of the caravan , but that willfully the people put themselves in these villageprisons under the rule of mullahs . " " You 're right about the past . " " Miller claimed that we can never go back to the caravan . Thatp245we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electricity . " " He 's right about the future , " and before Ellen could protest the decision , he leaped upon his horse to lead our caravan from the niggardly village , but then he galloped back to us and cried , " Some day all of us will live in villages like this . But they will be better villages . " And he was gone . The very next morning I had poetic confirmation that Zulfiqar 's vision of the future was more likely than Ellen 's , for in the early hours when light was just beginning to break across the peaks of the Koh-i-Baba , we sighted a village where dogs were silent , and we crept upon it unawares and were well inside the confines before we were discovered  --  great camels lumbering down the main road , peering into windows as the villagers were rising  --  and at one corner I saw a house lit with candles , and it seemed , there in the shadow of the mountains , like all the warm , homely refuges of the world . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wanderingnomads and the camels . It was one man 's home . Not even the soaring freedom of the Kochi tents , pitched beside torrents in the mountain passes , could equal the security of that chance home we saw in the half-darkness of dawn . The village people knew something the nomads would never know , a kind of spiritual freedom , and if they were forced to pay a terrible price for it , perhaps that was their choice .. To my surprise , as I brooded on these matters I looked up to see Zulfiqar , on his brown horse , staring at me and the house , and I think he was remembering our discussion of the morning before , and deciding anew that he and I were right ; but a dog began barking , the villagers poured out , and the old antagonism between nomad and villager was resumed . At first I had n't realized why the villagers were so apprehensive about locking things up as our caravan approached , but after I had seen flashing Mira at work I understood their antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that she had acquired some new piece of clothing , or a farm tool , or a kitchen utensil . Ellen once said , " The only thing that child hasn'tp246stolen is a bed . You watch ! If somebody leaves a door open some day . . . " At one camp I caught Mira with a new saw and asked her , " Why do you steal from the villagers ? " " When we march through , " she replied , " they look at me with hate and I look right back at them the same way . " Then she added , " But do you notice how the men follow me so hungrily with their eyes ? They 'd like to join the Kochis . . . for one night . I could spit at them ! " Our clan had ten large black tents , but many of the Kochis preferredsleeping on blankets in the open . Zulfiqar , his wife Racha , Ellen and Mira occupied one of the smaller tents , notable because it had an awning held up by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown and where the camp 's social life took place . In the late afternoons , when the animals were at ease , Zulfiqar would sit cross-legged between Racha and Ellen , discussingmatters with his people . I often joined them and thus formed the foundation for the friendship which developed between the Kochi leader and me . He asked me many questions , but I learned more than I taught . The Kochis were Muslims who ignored the tyranny of the mullahs but who held Mecca in as deep regard as any Sunni . As we discussedIslam , with its strong reliance upon nature and a powerful God who motivated all natural things , I better understood how Ellen and Dr. Stiglitz had been able to embrace this religion . One afternoon as we sat under the awning , Ellen said , " I could never explain my apostasy to my parents , and that 's the real reason why I ca n't write to them . You see , I was raised to believe that God personally hovered like an unseen helicopter just above the steeple of the Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked earlier how she loved to reel off that rubric , as if names alone symbolized the focus of her rebellion  --  " and although He was free to keep a weather eye on the Lutheran church down the street , His real responsibility was our congregation . We were the true religion . All else was delusion . I think
