The proposed administrator , Merle Stewart , is now serving as a consultant to the governing board while awaiting action on his nomination by the city Board of Education . An official of the city board , who did not want to be identified , said the board was making a thorough study of the patter . But he added that under city board ? regulations a person under indicfMent could not be appointed to a school post . Last night , Mayor Lindsay said in a statement : ? " Our school system can not permit an individual under inhictment for a violent crime to bold a position of responsibility . I trust the Board of Education will therefore exercise its supervisory obligation in I.S. 201 Names Anarchy Suspect for a School Post // board had hoped to persuade the local board to withdraw the nomination before it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive director of the I.S. 201 board , said the governing board would not have anything to say on the matter at this time but would issue a statement next week . Mr. Stewart could not be reached for comment . The district 's previous administrator was Charles E. Wilson . The position pays $30,000 a year . Mr. Stewart was one of 16 Negroes arrested in June , 1967 , when the police rounded up alleged members of the Revolutionary Action Movement , or RAM . Two of those arrested  --  Herman B. Ferguson and Arthur Harris  --  were subsequently convicted of conspiring to murder moderate civil rights leaders . Their conviction are being appealed . Mr. Stewart and 10 others were charged by a Queens grand jury with advocating criminal anarchy , but they have not been brought to trial laws . At the time of his arrest , Mr. Stewart 's occupation was given as civilian management analyst for the Navy .

" Ferguson , a former assistant principal at a Queens elementary school , had been employed after his indictment for a while by the I.S. 201 complex planning board , the forerunner of the present governing board . Speech Caused Outcry While working for the planning board , Ferguson delivered a controversial speech during a Malcolm X memorial program held on Feb. 21 , 1968 , at I.S. 201 . In his address , he urged Negroes to arm themselves for " self-defense " against whites . The local board , which had not yet assumed authority over I.S. 201 and the four elementary schools in the experimental district , dropped Ferguson from its staff after an outcry developed . The I.S. 201 complex Is one of three demonstration districts established two years ago to test limited community control of local schools as a means of bringing about educational improvements . The other demonstration districts are Ocean Hill-Brownsville in Brooklyn and Two Bridges on the Lower East Side . A dispute involving Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which kept a million pupils out of classes for 36 of the first 48 school days of the fall term . Last fall , a dispute involving union teachers developed at Public School 39 , in the I.S. 201 complex . The controversy was not resolved until last June , when the union teachers voluntarily transferred to other districts . Supporters of the demonstration districts have attributed much of their troubles to the former Board of Education  --  a new board took office last June  --  and the United Federation of Teachers . They have said that opponents of community control tried to sabotage the districts . They have also said that the districts , particularly the I.S. 201 complex and Ocean HillBrownsville , made substantial educational gains . The new development involving the I.S. 201 complex comes at a time when the fate of the three demonstration districts is uncertain . Under the new decentralization law , the city system next month will announce proposed district lines for the community school districts to be established within the city . The three demonstration districts have too few pupils to qualify under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , have been hoping that the city board would find a way to salvage the projects .
