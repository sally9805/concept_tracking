' Picking Up the Pieces by John Wain Mr. Connolly has consistently seen himself , and consistently presented himself to the public , not merely as a writer but as a phenomenon , a " case . " It is the function of the " case " to raise interesting general questions , and one of the questions raised by the Connolly case is that of the whole status of newspaper criticism in our time . As the Press , even the serious Press , has become steadily more trivialized , the space allotted to literary criticism has been cut back and back , so that even an important book nowadays receives fewer and shorter reviews than many an insignificant book of thirty years ago . A small number of serious papers , generally weeklies , monthlies or quarterlies , have reacted against this by allotting very generous space to a Few selected books , and the more dedicated critics have tended to gravitate toward the longer article . This does n't mean that one can not do good work in the eight hundred words commonly allowed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; what it means is that these shorter reviews are useful to the critic mainly for recording his interim impressions , for building up towards more solid studies , or for indicating the direction in which his thoughts are turning . Eight hundred or a thousand words , destined to be read over breakfast by dressing-gowned citizenry on Sunday morning and junked on Monday , can be written with some useful objectives in view , but permanence is not one of them . Mr. Connolly , however , persists in thinking otherwise . Most of his collections of essays consist of just these short , fragmentary reviews , which set off hopefully towards the discussion of some large topic but trip , after a few steps , over the uncompromising curbstone of the book that has to be reviewed . The result , when one reads a whole bookful of them , is distressingly claustrophobic , like watching a powerful circus horse gallop round and round a very small ring . And yet ? the question is bound to arise ? why does n't the horse break out of the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be that he has come to prefer being cramped ? In the Introduction to his new collection Mr. Connolly deals with this question , but not , it must be admitted , very satisfactorily . " My last two books of collected essays are both out of print , " he confides plangently ; " I really do n't know why one goes on . " The reader unversed in the ways of the literary world would hardly gather from this that Mr. Connolly was far and away the craftiest living exponent of the art of prolonging the life of fragmentary journalism . If he writes an article that meets with his own approval he generally manages to keep it before the public for year after year . The Condemned Playground , for example , came out in 1945 and creamed the reviews he had published since 1927 ; this selection was creamed again and the thirteen fattest reprinted in a widely-diffused American paperback , with Enemies of Promise and some later pieces , fifteen years later ; and now , four years later again , the new hardcover book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperback . So that anyone who buys all Mr Connolly 's collections has to go on reading certain pieces over and over again , in addition to having read most of them in the pages of newspapers and magazines . This would n't matter if the pieces themselves were more substantial . But the form of the 800-word review is as merciless as that of the haiku . First , a nod in the direction of the book ( " Merovingian drinking-horns are among the most useful reminders of a vanished era , and Mr. Bloggs is their ideal entrepreneur " ) , then a scatter of epigrams , bringing a number of unrelated apercus into something like unity - sufficiently like one , at any rate , to pass muster on a Sunday morning . We all do it , those of us who write 800-word reviews . The really fatal thing , the constant incitement to shallowness and silliness , is the fact that we know we shall be read by a large number of people who have no interest in the book under review , who do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our article in search of momentary interest and amusement . It is the presence of this large , distraction-hungry but fundamentally uninterested audience that makes the average weekly reviewer such a tedious show-off , dressing up platitudes in fire-new metaphors or coming out with half-truths destined to tickle the jaded mind . Mr. Connolly has a fatal gift for both these categories , especially the second : " London is the capital of prose , as Paris of art or New York of modern living and most of this good prose is concerned with dandies or with slums or fog . " It 's good stuff to read on a Sunday Then there is that pitfall of condemned literary journalism , the attempt to discuss a big subject in a few sentences , followed immediately by the chill realization that it ca n't be done , and then by the lapse into platitude and evasion . Here is Mr. Connolly on Dylan Thomas : " Of course , his detractors are right in that some of his poetry is merely surrealist and consists of heavily flogged imagery which belies all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he could weld his own backward-looking religious and romantic sensibility into the new forms he desired , he created a new poetry : as Hugo said of Baudelaire , a ' frisson nouveau ' . " I am sure there is a real response to Thomas 's poetry somewhere behind those lines , but the passage itself is simply too vague and unspecific to be of any use . What is " mere " surrealism ? Is the injection of surrealism in Thomas 's youthful poetry no more than a hampering alien element ? In what sense was Thomas 's sensibility " romantic ? " In the same way as Baudelaire 's ? Is that , perhaps , the point of the comparison with Baudelaire ? Or is it the " newness " of Thomas 's forms that links him with Baudelaire ? - and how new were they , with their affinities with classical Welsh prosody , with 17th-Century English lyric meters , and with the great Romantic odes ? Mr. Connolly has , I am sure , his own answers to these questions . And if the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into more rewarding detail , what 's wrong with expanding the article a little when putting it into hard covers ? The fact is , I am afraid , that the cramped conditions of modern newspaper criticism make it impossible for even so good a critic as Mr. Connolly to do consistently satisfactory work , solid enough to stand up in book form . " We like to get the best of our ephemeral criticism between hard covers , " Mr. Connolly explains , " where it can be perpetuated a little longer . " Is this irony or just bad writing ? Something kept alive " a little longer " ca n't be said to be " perpetuated . " It 's like asking for another few days of immortality . No , the only thing to do is to admit that there has been a disaster , that a fine critic has been disastrously hampered by social and economic conditions which have provided a shelter and excuse for his own self-destructive tendencies - and then to pick up the pieces . As we all know , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all old hands , is cunning at getting for review the books that interest him - those dealing with subjects with which he has grown to feel at ease over the years . Responsive to landscape , to certain European cities , to the Mediterranean , to animals , including fish and reptiles ; a collector of objets d'art , knowledgeable about furniture and architecture ; at home in certain favorite periods of the past , uneasily responsive to much in the present , Mr. Connolly is ideally equipped to be the observant amateur . It is impossible to imagine him writing an authoritative study of anything , but he has the sensibility and the knowledge to read the authoritative studies and put in a remark here and there which goes to the heart of the subject . Examples are easy to find . On the - 18th Century : " When we analyze the appeal of the 18th Century , it is based not on such luxury or fantasy or ceremony as the age possessed but on simplicity . It was a small world with fewer people and they with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . We seek it out for its life-giving properties and these are to be found not in externals but in conversation , in love , in affection , in adventure . " On modern patronage : " Rogers , in fact , was the prototype of the modern patron , of the small , neat , frugal millionaires who compete with their proteges , who try to paint instead of getting someone to paint them , who privately print their own works , who pick brains for ballets , lend cottages to poets and then sue them for the telephone bill and who encourage talent in order to devour it . " And always there is that gift for annihilating satirical parody ( his destruction of the prose style of Hugh Kenner 's book on Eliot is convincing and final ) and that other , related , gift for pinning down the aesthetic qualities of some writer in a swift phrase that goes straight to the bull's-eye and comes back to our minds whenever we read that writer henceforth : " The persistent quality of Huysman 's work is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this equipment , Mr. Connolly happily enters once more the pastures he has found most green . Virtually all these essays deal with topics he has discussed many times . Europe , travel , eating in restaurants , London life , animals ; French literature , particularly of that period when the French were inventing modern literature and setting the standards for a hundred years of work by the writers of every other nation ; the Latin classics ; the English 18th Century , especially as expressed in its biographies , memoirs and lighter literature ; and ? with perhaps the keenest appetite of all ? those English , American and Irish writers who represented the modern art of letters when he was a young man and whose work therefore carries the freshness of his own youth . The best piece in the the book , a sixteen-page essay on " The Breakthrough in Modern Verse , " contains excellent criticism of Pound and Eliot in the crucial early years of their creativity . More densely written than most of the other essays , it is dominated by an evident wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact and aesthetic appreciation : it shows Mr. Connolly at his best , and the tragedy is that his best is so rarely on show .
