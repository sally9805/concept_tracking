Bliss , the Republican National Chairman , yesterday offered Representative John V. Lindsay the fui/ assistance of the national organization in his race for Mayor . Robert Price , Mr. Lindsay 's closest political associate , who is due to become his campaign manager , said there had been offers to help from other prominent Republicans outside the state . One of the most significant came from Attorney General Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts , who holds the highest administrative post to which a 1Negro has been elected in this country . Mr. Brooke 's success in winning high office in a state with a relatively small Negro population has given him national stature . He is expected to help Mr. Lindsay 's effort to obtain Negro support . Has National Complexion With these offers , Mr. Lind say 's attempt to block Mayor Wagner from winning a fourth term in November took on national complexion . Like Governor Rockefeller , Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to believe that a victory , or even a strong showing , by Mr. Lindsay would raise the morale of the party na- ! tionally . It is badly in need of a boost ) after the debacle of last November , when Senator Barry Goldwater , whom Mr. Lindsay refused to support , was over. ? heimingly defeated by Presi // dent Johnson . Party strategists believe the key to revival is in the big cities , where the Democrats have shown increasing strength . In a brief interview amid the hubbub of the newly established Lindsay campaign headquarters , Mr. Price said it was too early to indicate what use would be made of the offers of help from prominent Republicans . One visitor described the headquarters as " a madhouse . " Mr. Price 's desk was littered with telegrams and messages to call back so and so . . ! Telephones rang with an unremitting jangle as aides took calls from men and women offering to help . In a radio broadCast Thursday night Mr. Lindsay had asked for volunteers . In Washington , Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuading Mr. Lindsay to reconsider his refusal of last March 1 to run for Mayor . They said that at a dinner in Washington last Saturday Mr. Bliss had urged . hint to run , and had told him he believed the money needed for a campaign would be available . These sources said Mr. Bliss had been told by " friends in New York " early this spring ' that the necessary money would he made available if either Mr. : Lindsay or Mr. Javits ran . but not for " others . " After reading in a news- : paper that Mr. Lindsay was reconsidering , the sources said , Mr. Bliss again obtained assurances of the money from friends here and relayed the assurances to Mr. Lindsay . When asked about this report , aides of Mr. Lindsay said that Mr. Bliss was among a number : of Republicans . including Governor Rockefeller , Mr. Javits , ! and John Hay Whitney , editor in chief and publisher of The New York Herald Tribune , who had agreed to help raise money . Mr. Javits said last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , which will he announced . I have n't yet arrived at the finality of it with Mr. Lindsay . " Mr. Lindsay canceled virtually all of his weekend engagements to confer with assistants and advisers on the development of an organization , on issues to he raised and on raising campaign money . $1.5 Million Minimum In a brief sidewalk interview near the Roosevelt Hotel . Mr. Lindsay said he had some promises of financial help before he decided to run , but nothing to : spend . He said no ? 1 there was . enough money " to go ahead " ' and more was coming in . There was no way of estimating the amount , he said . Mr. Price said he had about $4,000 in " real money " on hand , which had been put up by admirers of Mr. Lindsay to ket the campaign started . He added in response to a question that he would not be able to estimate for another week or two just how much ' would he needed , but he did not seem concerned . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least S1.5 million , and preferably $2 million , would be needed . Mr. Price said he did not ex-. pest a decision for about two weeks on the candidates for President of the City Council and Controller . " I feel we would like to have candidates , regardless of party . who were willing to neck for the principles John believes in , " he said . Mr. Lindsay will consult the . county chairmen . Mr. Rockefeller , Mr. Javits , State Chairman Carl Spad and others on selection of running mates , but his will he the deciding voice . One Republican said it was logical for Mr. Lindsay to have the major voice , since he would want to put together " a real team . " " I think he will want young , energetic pavement-pounders who will be ready to ring doorbells and if there is a suitable Democrat in that category . I am sure he will get serious consideration . " the Republican said . Mr. Price said those who would head the campaign staff had not been named , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the Republican State Committee to lend Harry J. O'Donnell , its director of public relations , to handle public relations for Mr. Lindsay . Efforts were made yesterday to get Mr. Rockefeller and the city 's five county leaders together for the formal designation of Mr .. Lindsay . but conflicting engagements made it necessary to postpone the meeting until next week . The designation must he ratified at a meeting of the Republican county committeemen from the five counties .
