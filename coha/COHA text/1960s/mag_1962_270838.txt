For half a century , West Germany 's Demag Corp . has hustled the world over , selling steel mills and mining machines , bridges and boilers , cranes and canal diggers . In the process , Demag has grown into Europe 's biggest manufacturer of heavy machinery . Last year Demag 's sales in 97 countries totaled $250 million , and one-third of the world 's rolled steel is now churned out by Demag-made mills . In ironic tribute to the company 's size-and the fact that it has never made weapons-Germans call it " Krupp without teeth . " <P> Chiefly responsible for Demag 's growth has been bald , bespectacled Hans Reuter , 67. whose father launched the firm with a 1910 merger of three small Rhineland machinery makers . Last week , after 22 years as general manager of Demag , Reuter stepped up to chairman , to devote his time to such pet projects as Demag 's atomic research program . To replace himself as operating boss , Reuter named burly Engineer Heinrich Miller . 62 . <P> The difference may be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years after Hans Reuter went to work there , and rose from compressor salesman to head engineer . For the past two decades , he and Reuter have worked together 14 hours a day , automating Demag 's production lines , planning new products , and maneuvering salesmen around the globe to outbid competitors . A slow-spoken technocrat , Miller is alleged by his plaintive subordinates to start his work day " shortly after midnight , " i.e. , 7:30 a.m . <P> To mark the shift in command , Hans Reuter delivered a valedictory to his stockholders ( who include 30% of the company 's employees ) from the flower-decked stage of a movie theater in Demag 's sleepy home town of Duisburg . Characteristically , Reuter called for more growth and more mergers-both on the part of his own company and Common Market industry as a whole . Said he : " Larger combines are necessary . If the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. have steel combines which produce 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 tons annually , we in Europe can not be satisfied with works of a capacity of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reuter 's proposed new European combines : Demag , of course .
