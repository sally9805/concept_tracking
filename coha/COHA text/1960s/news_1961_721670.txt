txt President Kennedy 's message to Congress yesterday on measures required to meet our - international financial problems gives a sound diagnosis of the factors involved and charts a vigorous and imaginative program for meeting the problems . Moreover , the solutions offered reflect a broad view of the entire world situation , a view which recognizes in the main the dangers that unwise action to protect our gold supply might create for friendly nations in the industrialized and under-developed areas of the world . The President rejects any policy of economic isolationism for this country , and he has framed his proposed remedies so as to put minimum restraint upon the abundant flow of goods , people , services and capital across national boundaries . We hope the Congress will give quick , and sympathetic - attention to the legislation he requests . The most interesting innovation proposed by the President is what amounts to a two-price system for savings . The President . wants the Federal Reserve Board to be empowered to establish higher interest rates for savings deposits kept here by foreign Governments or monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The objective , of course , is to obtain a weapon which can be used to keep this country competitive in the international competition for short-term funds . The recent relatively low rates of interest for such funds here as compared with rates available abroad have played a major role in our unfavorable balance of payments and high rate of gold loss this past year . There is a precedent for this , of course , in the somewhat similar authorization with respect to Government bonds which Congress granted in the Second Liberty Bond Act . Much of the President 's message appears to be beyond controversy . The need for more effective performance by our economic system , the importance of increasing exports by lowering costs and introducing superior technology , the desirability of a major effort to spur foreign tourism here , the wisdom of providing more adequate Government financing aids for our exporters , these and many other of the President 's proposals seem incontrovertible . They have , in fact , long been urged by many quarters and the only mystery is why it has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's message was delivered yesterday the anticipation of some such imaginative and vigorous program last week caused an end to the gold rush in London and sent world confidence in the dollar to a new high in recent months . But if that happy situation is to continue , all of us will have to contribute to the major effort required to bring our international financial situation back into proper balance and keep it there . Union and corporation officials , for example , will have to make wage and price decisions with an understanding of the importance of keeping our goods and services competitive on the world market . The President , happily , has rejected that most unpleasant device for defending the dollar , exchange controls , but if he is to be able to maintain that position we shall all have to show a high self-discipline and awareness of the dangers that could threaten the dollar as we make our individual and business decisions as to what we buy and where we invest .               @ @ @ @ @ @
