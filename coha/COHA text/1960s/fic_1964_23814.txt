Stranger in Town A story by Nadine Gordimer In the office at the garage eight hours a day I wear mauve linen overalls  --  those snappy uniforms they make for girls who are n't really nurses . I 'm forty-nine but I could be twenty-five except for my face , and my legs . I 've got that very fair skin and my legs have gone mottled , like Roquefort cheese . My hair used to look pretty as chickens ' fluff , but now it 's like all that 's left of the coat of an old toy animal . It 's been bleached and permed too many times . I would n't admit this to anyone else , but to myself I admit everything . Perhaps I 'll get one of those wigs everyone 's wearing . You do n't have to be short of hair , anymore , to wear a wig . I 've been years at the garage  --  service station , as it 's been called since it was rebuilt all steel and glass . That 's at the front , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the workshop without getting grease on your things . But I do n't have much call to go there . Between doing the books you 'll see me hanging about in front for a breath of air , smoking a cigarette and keeping an eye on the boys . Not the mechanics  --  they 're all white chaps of course ( bunch of duck-tails they are , too , most of them ) ? but the petrol attendants . One boy 's been with the firmtwenty-three years  --  sometimes you 'd think he owns the place ; gets my goat . On the whole they 're not a bad lot of natives , though you get a cheeky bastard now and then , or a thief , but he does n't last long , with us . We 're just off the Greensleeves suburban shopping center with the terrace restaurant and the fountain , and you get a very nice class of person coming up and down . I 'm quite friends with some of the people from the luxury flats round about ; they would n't pass without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the shops . And , of course , you get to know a lot of the regular petrol customers , too . We 've got two Rolls and any amount of sports cars who never go anywhere else . And I only have to walk down the block to Maison Claude to get my hair done , or in to Mr. Levine at the Greensleeves Pharmacy if I feel a cold coming on . I 've got a flat in one of the old buildings that are still left , back in town . Not too grand , but for ten quid a month and right on the bus route . . . I was married once and I 've got a lovely kid  --  married since she was seventeen and living in Rhodesia ; I could n't stop her . She 's very happy with him and they 've got twin boys ; they 're real little toughies ! I 've see them once . There 's a woman friend I go to the early show with every Friday , and the Versfelds ' , where I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on me , poor old things ; they never see anybody . That 's the trouble when you work alone in an office , like I do , you do n't make friends at your work . Nobody to talk to but those duckies in the workshop , and what can I have in common with a lot of louts in black leather jackets ? No respect , efther  --  you should hear the things they come out with . I 'd sooner talk to the blacks , that 's the truth , though I know it sounds a strange thing to say . At least they call you Missus . Even old Madala knows he ca n't come into my office without taking his cap off , though heaven help you if you ask that boy to run up to the Greek for a packet of smokes , or round to the Swiss Confectionery . I had a dustup with him once over it , the old monkey-face , but the manager did n't seem to want to get rid of him , he 's been here so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has his half-crown from me at Christmas , same as the other boys . But you get more sense out of the boss-boy , Jack , than you can out of some whites , believe me , and he can make you laugh , too , in his way  --  of course they 're like children ; you see them yelling with laughter over something in their own language , noisy lot of devils ; I do n't suppose we 'd think it funny at all if we knew what it was all about . This Jack used to get a lot of phone calls ( I complained to the manager on the quiet and he 's put a stop to it , now ) , and the natives on the other end used to be asking to speak to Mpanza and Makiwane and I do n't know what all , and when I 'd say there was n't anyone of that name working here they 'd come out with it and ask for Jack . So I said to him one day , why do you people have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aunts and brothers-in-law come out with your name straight away and stop wasting my time ? He said , " Here I 'm Jack because Mpanza Makiwane is not a name , and there I 'm Mpanza Makiwane because Jack is not a name , but I 'm the only one who knows who I am wherever I am . " I could n't help Nadine Gordimer 's stories and novels  --  set in South . Africa and often in Johannesburg , where she lives  --  have been known internationally sinee the early 1950s , Her first volume of stories to be published in the U.S. took its title from one in " Harper 's " : " The Soft Voice of the Serpent . " Her most recent novel " Occasion for Loving " ? was published by the Viking Press in 1963. laughing . He hardly ever calls you Missus , I notice , but it does n't sound cheeky , the way he speaks . Before they were allowed to buy drink for themselves , he used to ask me to buy a bottle of brandy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . Even if things are not too bright , no use grumbling . I do n't believe in getting old before my time . Now and then it 's happened that some man 's taken a fancy to me at the garage . Every time he comes to fill up he finds some excuse to talk to me ; if a chap likes me , I begin to feel it just like I did when I was seventeen , so that even if he was just sitting in his car looking at me through the glass of the office , I would know that he was waiting for me to come out , Eventually he 'd ask me to the hotel for a drink after work . Usually that was as far as it went . I do n't know what happens to these blokes ; they are married , I suppose , though their wives do n't still wear a perfect size fourteen , like I do . They enjoy talking to another woman once in a while , but they quickly get nervous . They are businessmen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those old-fashioned compacts , we used to call them flapjacks , meant for loose powder , and I use the solid kind everyone uses now . Of course you get some funny types , and , as I say , I 'm alone there in the front most of the time , with only the boys ; the manager is at head office in town , and the other white men are all at the back . Little while ago , a fellow came into my office wanting to pay for his petrol with Rhodesian money . Well , Jack , the boss-boy , came first to tell me that this fellow had given him Rhodesian money . I sent back to say we did n't take it . I looked through the glass and saw a big , expensive American car , not very /lbw , and one of those men you recognize at once as the kind who moves about a lot  --  he was poking out his cheek with his tongue , looking round the station and out into the busy street  --  like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way around in a new town . Some people kick up hell with a native if he refuses them something , but this one did n't seem to ; the next thing was he got the boy to bring him to me . " Boss says he must talk to you , " Jack said , and turned on his heel . But I said , You wait here . I know Johannesburg ; my cashbox was there in the open safe . The fellow was young . He had that very tanned skin that has been sunburnt day after day , the tan you see on lifeguards at the beach . his hair was the thick streaky blond kind , wasted on men . He says , " Miss , ca n't you help me out for half-an-hour ? " 110 STRANGER IN TOWN Well , I 'd had my hair done , it 's true , but I do n't kid myself you could think of me as a miss unless you saw my figure , from behind . He went on , " I 've just driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my money . Just take this while I get hold of this chap I know and get him to change a check for me . " I told him there was a bank up the road , but he made some excuse about it not being worthwhile for that bit of cash . " I 've got to get my friend to change a check for me , anyway . Here , I 'll leave this  --  it 's a gold one ? " and he took the big fancy watch off his arm . " Go on , please . do me a favor ? " Somehow when he smiled he looked not so young , harder . The smile was on the side of his mouth . Anyway , I suddenly said OK , then , and the native boy turned and went out of the office , but I knew it was all right about my cash , and this fellow asked me which was the quickest way to get to Kensington , and I came out from behind my desk and looked it up with him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about twenty-nine or thirty ; he was so lean , with a snakeskin belt around his hips and a clean white open-neck shirt . He was back on the dot . I took the money for the petrol and said , Here 's your watch , pushing it across the counter . I 'd seen , the moment he 'd gone and I 'd picked up the watch to put it in the safe , that it was n't gold  --  one of those Jap fakes that men take out of their pockets and try to sell you on street corners . But I did n't say anything because maybe he 'd been had ? I gave him the benefit of the doubt . What 'd it matter ? He 'd paid for his petrol , anyway . He thanked me and said that he supposed he 'd better push off and find some hotel . I said the usual sort of thing  --  Was he here on a visit and so on  --  and he said , Yes , he did n't know how long exactly , perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like somewhere central . We had quite a little chat  --  you know how it is ; you always feel friendly if you 've done someone a favor and it 's all worked out OK  --  and I mentioned a couple of hotels . But it 's difficult if you do n't know what sort of place a person wants ; you may send him somewhere too expensive , or on the other hand you might recommend one of the small places that he 'd consider just a joint , such as the New Park , near where I live . Afew days later I 'd been down to the shops at lunch hour and when I came by where some of the boys were squatting over their lunch in the sun , Jack said , " That man came again . " Thinks I can read his mind . What man ? I said , but they never learn . " The other day , with the money that was no good . " Oh , you mean the Rhodesian , I said . Jack did n't answer but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaf and stuffing them into his mouth . One of the other boys began telling , in their own language with bits of English thrown in , what I could tell was the story of how the man had tried to pay with money that was no good ; big joke , you know ; but Jack did n't take any notice , I suppose he 'd heard it once too often . I went into my office to fetch a smoke , and when I was enjoying it outside in the sun Jack came over to the tap near me . I heard him drinking from his hand , and then he said , " He went and looked in the office window . " Did n't he buy petrol ? I said . " He pulled up at the pump but then he did n't buy ; he said he will come back later . " Well , that 's all right ; what 're you getting excited about ? We sell people as much petrol as they like , I said . I felt uncomfortable , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving away petrol at the garage 's expense or something . " You ca n't come from Rhodesia on those tires , " Jack said . No ? I said . " Did you look at those tires ? " Why should I look at tires ? " No-no , you look at those tires on that old car , " Jack said . " You ca n't drive six hundred miles or so on those tires . Worn out ! Down to the tread I " But who cares where he came from ? I said . That 's his business . " But he had that money , " Jack said to me . He shrugged and I shrugged ; I went back into my office . As I say , sometimes you find yourself talking to that boy as if he was a white person . Just before five that same afternoon the fellow came back . I do n't know how it was ; I happened to look up like I knew the car was going to he there . He was taking petrol and paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know what got into me , curiosity maybe , but I got up and came to my door and said , How 's Jo'burg treating you ? " Ah , hell , I 've had bad luck , " he says ; " the place I was staying had another booking for my room from today . I was supposed to go to my friend in Berea , but now his wife 's brother has come . I do n't mind paying for a decent place , but you take one look at some of them . . . Do n't you know somewhere ? " Well yes , I said ; I was telling you that day . And I mentioned the Victoria , but he said he 'd tried there , so then I told him about the New Park , near me . He listened , but looking round all the time , his mind was somewhere else . He said , " They 'll tell me they 're full ; it 'll be the same story . " I told him that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would be 112 STRANGER TN TOWN sure to fix him up . " You could n't ask her ? " he said . I said , Well , all right ; from my place she was only around the corner ; I 'd pop in on my way home from work and tell her he 'd be getting in touch with her . When he heard that , he said he 'd give me a lift in his car , and so I took him to Mrs. Douglas myself , and she gave him a room . As we walked out of the hotel together he seemed wrapped up in his own affairs again , but on the pavement he suddenly suggested a drink . I thought he meant we 'd go into the hotel lounge , but he said , " I 've got a bottle of gin in the car , " and he brought it up to my place . He was telling me about the time he was in the Congo a few years ago , fighting for that native chief , whatsis name , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsis name down . The stories he told about Elisabethville ! He was paid so much he could live like a king , We only had two gins each out the bottle , but when I wanted him to take it . along with him , he said , " I 'll come in for it sometime when I get a chance . " Ile did n't say anything , but I got the idea he had come up to Jo'burg about a job . Iwas frying a slice of liver next evening when he turned up at the door . The bottle was still standing where it 'd been left . You feel uncomfortable when the place 's full of the smell of frying and anyone can tell you 're about to eat . I gave him the bottle but he did n't take it ; he said he was on his way to Vereeniging to see someone ; he would just have a quick drink . I had to offer him something to eat , with me . He was one of those people who eat without noticing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ; I mean he did n't look round at my things the way it 's natural you do in someone else 's home . And there was a lovely photo of my kid on the built-in fixture round the electric fire . I said to him while we were eating , Is it a job you 've come down for ? He smiled the way youngsters smile at an older person who wo n't understand , anyway . " On business . " But you could see that he was not a man who had an office , who wore a suit and sat in a chair . He was like one of those men you see in films , you know , the stranger in town who does n't look as if he lives anywhere . Somebody in a film , thin and burned brick-red and not saying much . / mean he did talk but it was never really anything about himself , only about things he 'd seen happen . He never asked me anything about myself , either . It was queer ; because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just the same as if we were people who know each other so well they do n't talk about themselves anymore . Another funny thing was , all the time he was coming in and out the flat , I was talking about him with the boy  --  with Jack . I do n't believe in discussing white people with natives , as a rule ; I mean , whatever I think of a white , it encourages disrespect if you talk about it to a black . I 've never said anything in front of the boys about the behavior of that crowd of duck-tails in the workshop , for instance . And of course I would n't be likely to discuss my private life with a native boy . Jack did n't know that this fellow was coming to the fiat , but he 'd heard me say I 'd fix it up about the New Park Hotel , and he 'd seen me take a lift home that afternoon . The boy 's remark about the tires seemed to stick in my mind ; I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congo . " In that car ? " Jack said ; he 's got such a serious face , for a native . The car goes all right , I said ; he 's driving all over with it now . Jack said , " Why does n't he bring it in for retreads ? " I said he was just on holiday ; he would n't have it done here . The fellow did n't appear for five or six days and I thought he 'd moved on , or made friends , as people do in this town . There was still about two fingers left in his bottle . I do n't drink when I 'm on my own . Then he turned up at the garage just at the time I knock off . Again I meant to look at the tires for myself , but I forgot . He took me home just like it had been an arranged thing ; you know , a grown-up son calling for his mother , not because he wants to , but because he has to . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pies , which was n't much of a dinner to offer anyone , but , as I say , he did n't know what he was eating , and he did n't want the gin ; he had some cans of beer in the car . He leaned his chair back with all the weight on two legs and said , " I think I must clear out of this lousy dump ; I do n't know what you 've got to be to get along here with these sharks . " I said , You kids give up too easy ; have you still not landed a job ? " A job ! " he said . " They owe me money , I 'm trying to get money out of them . " What 's it all about , I said ; what money ? He did n't take any notice , as if I would n't understand . " Smart alecs and swindlers . I been here nearly three lousy weeks , now . " I said , Everybody who comes here finds Jo'burg tough compared with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted it straight and looked at me . " I 'm not such a kid . " No ? I said , feeling a bit awkward because he never talked about himself before . He was looking at me all the time , you 'd have thought he was going to find his age written on my face . " I 'm thirty-seven , " he said . " Did you know that ? Thirty-seven . Not so much younger . " Forty-nine . It was true , not so much . But he looked so young , with that hair always slicked back longish behind the ears as if he 'd just come out of the shower , and that brown neck in the open-neck shirt . Lean men wear well , youa story by Nadine Gordimer 119 ca n't tell . He did have false teeth , though ; that was why his mouth made him look hard . I supposed he could have been thirty-seven ; I did n't know , I did n't know . It was like the scars on his body . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my heart was in my mouth for him when I saw them , still pink and raw-looking , but he said that the ones on his back were from strokes he 'd had in a boys ' home as a kid and the others were from the fighting in Katanga . I know nobody would believe me , they would think I was just trying to make excuses for myself , but in the morning everything seemed just the same ; 1 did n't feel I knew him any better . It was just like it was that first day when he came in with his Rhodesian money . He said , " Leave me the key . I might as well use the place while you 're out all day . " But what about the hotel ? I said . " I 've taken my things , " he says I said , You mean you 've moved out ? And something in his face , the bored sort of look , made me ask , You 've told Mrs. Douglas ? " She 's found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to smile . You mean you went without paying ? I said . " Look , I told you I ca n't get my money out of those bastards . " Well , what could I do ? I 'd taken him to Mrs. Douglas myself . The woman 'd given him a room on my recommendation . I had to go over to the New Park and spin her some yarn about him having to leave suddenly and that he 'd left the money for me to pay . What else could I do ? Of course I did n't tell him . But I told Jack . That 's the funny thing about it . I told Jack that the man had disappeared , run off without paying my friend who ran the hotel where he was staying . The boy clicked his tongue the way they do , and laughed . And I said that was what you got for trying to help people . Yes , he said , Johannesburg was full of people like that , but you learn to know their faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think that man had a nice face ? You see he has a nice face , " the boy said . I was afraid I 'd find the fellow there when I got home , and he was there . I said to him , That 's my daughter , and showed him the photo , but he took no interest , not even when I said she lived in Lusaka and perhaps he knew the town himself . I said , Why did n't he go back to Rhodesia to his job , but he said the place was finished : he was n't going to be pushed around by a lot of blacks running the show  --  from what he told 120 STRANGER IN TOWN me , it 's awful ; you ca n't keep them out of hotels or anything . Later on he went out to get some smokes and I suddenly thought , I 'll lock the door and I wo n't let him into the flat again . I had made up my mind to do it . But when I saw his shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and opened it , and I felt like a fool  --  what was there to be afraid of ? He was such a clean , good-looking fellow standing there ; and anybody can be down on his luck . I sometimes wonder what 'll happen to me  --  in some years , of course  --  if I ca n't work anymore and I 'm alone here , and nobody comes . Every Sunday you read about women dead alone in fiats , and no one discovers it for days . He smoked night and day , like the world had some bad smell that he had to keep out of his nose . He was smoking in the bed at the weekend , and I made a remark about Princess Margaret when she was here as a kid in 1947 ? I was looking at a story about the Royal family , in Woman and Home . He said he supposed he 'd seen her ; it was the year he went to the boys ' home and they were taken to watch the procession . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was eight when he was sent to the home ; I lay there and worked out that if he was thirty-seven , he should have been twenty in 1947 , not eight years old . But by then I found it hard to believe that he was only twenty-five . You could always get rid of a boy of twenty-five . He would n't have the strength inside to make you afraid to try it . I 'd 've felt safer if someone had known about him and me , but of course I could n't talk to anyone . Imagine the Versfelds . Or the woman I go out with on Fridays ! I do n't think she 's had a cup of tea with a man since her husband died . I remarked to Jack , the boss-boy , How old did hethink that man had been , the one with the Rhodesian money who cheated the hotel ? He said , " He 's still here ? " 1 said , No , no , I just wondered . " He 's young , that one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the time natives do n't know their own age ; it does n't matter to them the way it does to us . I said to him , Wha'd'you call young ? lie jerked his head back at the workshop : " Same like the mechanics . " That bunch of kids ! But this fellow was n't cocky like them , wrestling with each other all over the place , calling after girls , fancying themselves Elvis Presley when they sing in the washroom . The people he used to go off to see about things  --  I never saw any of them . If he had friends , they never came round . If only somebody else had known he was in the flat ! Then he said he was having the car overhauled because he was going off to Durban . He said he had to leave the next Saturday . So I felt much better ; I also felt bad , in a way , because there I 'd been , thinking I 'd have to find some way to make him go . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled right out at me and said , " Sorry ; got to push on and get moving sometime , you know , " and it was true that in a way he was right ; I could n't think what it 'd be like without him , though I was always afraid he would stay . Oh he was nice to me then , I can tell you ; he could be nice if he wanted to ; it was like a trick that he could do , so real you could n't believe it when it stopped just like that . I told him he should 've brought the car into our place ; I 'd 've seen to it that they did a proper job on it . But , no , a friend of his was doing it free , in his own workshop . Saturday came , he did n't go . The car was n't ready . He sat about most of the week , disappeared for a night , but was there again in the morning . I 'd given him a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , What are you mucking about with that car in somebody 's backyard for ? Take it to a decent garage . Then  --  I 'll never forget it  --  cool as anything , a hit irritated , he said , " Forget it . I have n't got the car anymore . " I said , Wha'd'you mean , you mean you 've sold it ? ? I suppose because in the back of my mind I 'd been thinking , Why does n't he sell it , he needs money . And he said , " That 's right . It 's sold , " but I knew he was lying ; he could n't be bothered to think of anything else to say . Once he 'd said the car was sold , he said he was waiting for the money ; he did pay me back three quid , but he borrowed again a day or so later . He 'd keep his back to me when I came into I22 STRANGER IN TOWN the flat and he would n't answer when I spoke to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that closed , half-asleep face and I 'd think , This is it , now this is it  --  I ca n't explain how finished , done-for I felt ; I only know that he had on his face exactly the same look I remember on the face of a man , once , who was drowning some kittens , one after the other in a bucket of water  --  just as I knew it was coming , he would burst out laughing at me . It was the only time he laughed . He would laugh until , nearly crying , I would begin to laugh too . Arid we would pretend it was kidding , and he would be nice to me , oh , he would be nice to me . I used to sit in my office at the garage and look round at the car advertisements and the maps on the wall and my elephant ear growing in the oil drum , and that was the only place I felt , But this is nonsense , what 's got into me ? The flat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I 'd go home at five and there it would all be . I said to Jack , What 's a ' 58 Chrysler worth ? He took his time : he was cleaning his hands on some cotton waste . He said , " With those tires , nobody will pay much . " Just to show him that he must n't get too free with a white person , I asked him to send up to Mr. Levine for a headache powder for me . I joked , I 'm getting a hit like old Madala there , I feel so tired today . D' you know what that boy said to me then ? They 've got more feeling than whites sometimes , that 's the truth . He said , " When my children grow up they must work for me . Why do n't you live there in Rhodesia with your daughter ? The daughter must look after the mother . Why must you stay here alone in this town ? " Of course I was n't going to explain to him that I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get old I die before I become a burden on anybody . But that afternoon I did something I should 've done long ago : I said to the boy , If ever I do n't turn up to work , you must tell them in the workshop to send someone to my flat to look for me . And I wrote down the address . Days could go by before anyone 'd find what had become of me ; it 's not right . When I got home that same evening , the fellow was n't there . He 'd gone . Not a word , not a note ; nothing . Every time I heard the lift rattling I thought , Here he is . But he did n't come . When I was home on Saturday afternoon I could n't stand it any longer and I went up to the Versfelds ' and asked the old lady if I could n't sleep there a few days ; I said my flat was being painted and the smell turned my stomach . I thought , If he comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are the boys . I was smoking nearly as much as he used to and I could n't sleep . I had to ask Mr. Levine to give me something . The slightest sound and I was in a cold sweat . At the end of the week I had to go back to the flat , and I bought a chain for the door and made a heavy curtain so 's you could n't see anyone standing there . I did n't go out , once I 'd got in from work  --  not even to the early show  --  so I would n't have to come back into the building at night . You know how it is when you 're nervous , the funniest things comfort you : I 'd just tell myself , well , if I should n't turn up to work in the morning , the boy 'd send someone to see . Then slowly I was beginning to forget about it . I kept the curtain and the chain and I stayed at home , but when you get used to something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it all the time , anymore , though you still believe you do . I had n't been to Maison Claude for about two weeks and my hair was a sight . Claude advised a soft perm and so it happened that I took a couple of hours off in the afternoon to get it done . The boss-boy Jack says to me when I come back , " He was here . " I did n't know what to do ; I could n't help staring quickly all round . When , I said . " Now-now , while you were out . " I had the feeling I could n't get away . I knew he would come up to me with that closed , half-asleep face  --  burned as a good-looker lifeguard , burned like one of those tramps who are starving and lousy and pickled with cheap booze but have a horrible healthy look that comes from having nowhere to go out of the sun . I do n't know what that boy must have thought of me , my face . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work here anymore . You went to Rhodesia to your daughter . I do n't know which place . " And he put his nose back in one of the newspapers he 's always reading whenever things are slack ; I think he fancies himself quite the educated man and he likes to read about all these blacks who are becoming prime ministers and so on in other countries these days . I never remark on it ; if you take any notice of things like that with them , you begin to give them big ideas about themselves .
