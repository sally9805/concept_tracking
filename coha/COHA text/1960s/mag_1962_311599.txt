Playing a club date one evening recently , Jazz Pianist Bill Evans slid unaccompanied into a fragilely twining song of his own composition titled Peace Piece . Afterwards , a teen-age fan rushed ecstatically up to the piano . " He told me , " recalls Evans with a faintly puzzled frown , " that when he heard it he felt like he was standing all alone in New York . " <P> In varying degrees Evans , 32 , inspires the same feeling of apartness in all his fans . At the piano he seems transported , and some of the trancelike visual effect rubs off on the customers . When he hunches his tall , spare frame over the keyboard , as he did last week in Manhattan 's Birdland , fixing his eyes on his belt buckle and stroking the keys with disembodied-looking fingers , he seems to be responding to promptings from far beyond the bandstand on which a bass and a drum plunk and sizzle quietly . The music itself often has a trancelike quality . A listener can find himself hypnotized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now or My Foolish Heart-because it contains no qualifications or showy embellishments . It is , as nearly as Evans can make it a simple and unadulterated musical idea . <P> The Evans audience is not large , but it is a distinguished one , including a large share of Evans ' fellow jazzmen . What Evans has returned most notably to the jazz piano besides simplicity is the long melodic line , which , says Evans , is " the basic thing I want in my playing because music is singing . " The influences pointing the way were Pianists Nat Cole and Bud Powell and Trumpeter Miles Davis . A New Jersey boy , Evans studied classical piano as a youngster , at twelve filled in one evening with a local dance band and was hooked on jazz . He played his way through Southeastern Louisiana College , there first heard the records of Saxophonist Lee Konitz and the Lennie Tristano school : " I felt for the first time as if I were hearing jazz played that had n't been learned by osmosis ; they were making an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans gigged around , suffered through three unhappy years in the army , only began to win polls and influence people in 1958 , when he spent almost a year with the Miles Davis Quintet . <P> A shy and uncertain man , Evans was persuaded with great difficulty to record his first album for Riverside in 1956 . The album was a hit , but he let more than two years pass before he would try another . " You ca n't turn inspiration on and off , ' ' he says . " You can only hit the supreme moments occasionally . " But the supreme moments , admits Evans , relaxing into a rare smile , have carried him a long way : " Music is the only thing that has dragged me through life . "
