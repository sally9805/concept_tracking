Trivia Question : What five movie actors have played Philip Marlowe , Raymond Chandler 's private eye ? <P> Answer : Humphrey Bogart ( The Big Sleep ) ; Dick Powell ( Murder My Sweet ) ; Robert Montgomery ( The Lady in the Lake ) ; George Montgomery ( The Brasher Doubloon ) . <P> The latest , and by no means least impersonation is by James Garner in Marlowe . Bogart is a tough act to follow , and none of the other Marlowes ever matched his blend of soluble morals and incorruptible conscience . Yet of all the Marlowes , Garner is physically closest to the invulnerable knight who could get sapped in the morning and crack a joke and a case by lunchtime . <P> For Philip , prosperity is just around the coroner . In Marlowe-an adaptation of Chandler 's The Little Sister-he follows the spoor of a runaway brother who leaves ice picks in people 's necks . On the trail , the shamus uncovers some California tourist attractions ( Gayle Hunnicutt , Rita Moreno ) , some lethal gangsters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Marlowe still packs a heater in a shoulder holster , and still operates out of an office that could qualify for urban renewal . But for this film , Director Paul Bogart ( no kin ) is just keeping down appearances . Whenever the plot calls for straight shooting , he is as crooked as a cop on the take , using sleazy trick photography and mannered techniques . In a scene of two people in a large living room , for example , Bogart can be counted on to plant the viewer in the fireplace , behind the flames . <P> Nor is Marlowe much aided by Scenarist Stirling Silliphant . Chandler 's rhetoric could occasionally be wooden ; Silliphant 's is consistently plastic , as for instance , when a girl warns a competitor that Marlowe is a " no-no . " <P> The ordinary detective is a hunk of merchandise , like a gun and bullets . Anybody with enough small change can buy him . Philip Marlowe is the exception . " Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid . " Trading on the name , the Marlowe makers have banished fear , but they forgot to remove the tarnish.
