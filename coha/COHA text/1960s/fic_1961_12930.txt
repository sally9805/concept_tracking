SCENE : A MEAT MARKET , in a side street in St. Albans , L. I. , N. Y. TIME : A late Spring Morning , the Present . IT IS A BRIGHT WARM MORNING - Already people are going about in their shirt-sleeves and frilly cottons , though in this street there are few passers-by . THE MARKET is but a shell in the Center of a simulated row of store-fronts . WITHIN there is a small counter and chrome-trimmed meat case . To the LEFT of it is a real door , beside a painted window bearing the sign : " MERIT EXTERMINATORS " On the RIGHT , near the corner , a step leads up to the ostensible entrance to a vacant store above the sidewalk . AS THE CURTAIN RISES , DRAG , a " wino , " lean and emaciated , and wearing an old sport jacket and a pair of worn , dirty , two-toned shoes , is seen lolling on the steps , with a pail nearby , containing a batch of old rags and a can of simonizing wax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic build in a sleeveless sweat-shirt and butcher 's apron , is seen polishing the chrome trimmings as he sings , exuberantly : a snatch of song . WALLIS ( Singing in a rich tenor ) OH , THE GIRL I LOVE DROPPED IN ONE DAY WHILE THE SUN SHONE DOWN BEHIND HER , AND OH , I THOUGHT I HEARD THE ANGELS SHOUT : " BLESS GOD , HE 'S FINALLY FOUND HER ! " p. 3 DRIFT ( Emerging from door , next door , enters bearing a work kit , to greet boy breezily ) Whatchu say , Battling Thunderbird  --  Boy , I know the way you singing , you sure feel good this mawnin ! WALLIS ( Turning to see this huge , black man , grinning in cast-offs way too large for him , though suggesting poverty not the garb of the Comedian --  Matter-o-factly , running his hand into his pocket ) How much this time ? DRIFT ( Coyly ) Now , Battler , there you go ! You sure is one suspicious Zigwalk ! WALLIS You did n't come in here just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battler , you 's a killer  --  I admit we do need a lil change . But tai n't me ; it 's my Buddy , Drag , out there . That poor boy drank so much " Stinkey Pete " last night , he got up this mawnin doin the " Shimmy " , and here we is got a job to do . WALLIS You and Drag both are going to keep guzzling that rotten sherry till you end up stacked like cord-wood with the rest of the Stiffs bound for Riker 's Island . DRIFT ( Laughing ) Oh , but I love my beautiful self . Soon 's I hit the Numbers I 'm goin join Alcoholics Anonymous ! p. 4 WALLIS I know it 's the truth . DRIFT But no foolin , Man . We got a sure nuff job to do , and I just want to ask you to let us leave our tools here and lend me a dollar -- - WALLIS Oh , but you never was so wrong ! DRIFT But it 's jes tell we git back . Merit , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you say  - -  -  ( He glances at kit ) DRIFT Yeah , Man . He short of hands this mawnin , and he wants us to do a lil sterminatin for him . WALLIS What do you know about " exterminating ? " DRIFT ( Going to door , meanwhile ) Oh , but I 'm the best that ever did it . I 'm a rat killer from way back ! ( Calling to DRAG ) Hey , Buddy , bring the bucket . WALLIS ( Taking out dollar ) You just want to get drunk . But you 'd better not get so drunk you forget where you got this  - -  -  ( Hands him dollar ) DRIFT ( Happily ) Thanks , Man . You saved our lives ! ( Takes pail from DRAG , handing latter kit ) But do n't worry about a thing . I 'll lay it on you , no sooner'n we get back ! p. 5 WALLIS ( Sets pail in corner ) You dead better ... ( The PAIR exits going off left happily as TERESA enters  --  A BEAUTIFUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frock ) ( The BOY seeing her joyfully sings : " THERE 'S A SONG ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE " , as he emerges to greet her ) THERE 'S A SONG ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE , MOCKING ME , AS THEY SAY , AND IT 'S ALL ABOUT YOU AND MY HOPES , HAUNTING ME , NIGHT AND DAY ! TERESA ( There is a strained air about her as though she were burdened with some heavy emotional problem , and it remains throughout the scene , though she joins in the duet ) LIKE A DREAM YOU STRIVE TO REMEMBER , HOVERING , VAGUELY IN MIND , YOU USE ALL YOUR MIGHT TO RECALL IT , LEAVING THE BEST BEHIND ! WALLIS YET , I SWEAR ON MY SOUL , MY DARLING , HOLDING YOU , AS I DO , EVERY MUSCLE AND BONE IN MY BODY 'S ACHING WITH LOVE OF YOU ! TERESA THOUGH I FEEL YOUR STRONG ARMS AROUND ME , TREMBLING , I 'M LIKE A CHILD , THOUGH I 'VE HEARD ALL TRUE LOVE IS HOLY , QUAKING , MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WISH I COULD DO MORE THAN SWEAR THE HOMAGE , I BEAR SO TRUE , BUT IF I HAD THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL , GLORY WOULD SHINE ON YOU ! ( He embraces her ) TERESA ( Shortly , breaking away ) Stop now ! This is too embarrassing . WALLIS ( Laughing ) The devil with that  --  It 's been two whole weeks , Honey , since I 've seen you ! TERESA I had to go with Mrs. Carson to Washington . WALLIS ( Complaining ) And all I got was one card ! TERESA ( Troubled ) I wanted to write . But I knew that would n't do for what 's on my mind  --  That 's why I made her give me the weekend . WALLIS ( Gladly ) That 's my girl ! TERESA Oh , do n't flatter yourself  --  You may not want to see me again before it 's over . WALLIS ( Struck ) Oh , yeah ? Why so ? TERESA ( Quietly ) I 'll tell you later . p. 7 WALLIS You sound like you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to talk . ( Shifting ) But what 've you been doing with your charming self since I saw you ? WALLIS Ringing your Aunt 's doorbell , mostly . TERESA So she told me . WALLIS I wish your Mrs. Carson lived in town and she did n't have to be always separating us . TERESA I 'd give a lot to believe it . WALLIS Honey , you do n't doubt me ? TERESA Oh , I do n't know , Wallis . But I 'm wondering if we 're right for each other . WALLIS ( Shocked ) No ! TERESA ( Realizing its bearing on her secret problem , she begins fighting for a basic understanding between them ) Everything else aside . I know you 're warm-hearted and affectionate . But life is no bowl of cherries , and you seem to think so . Sometimes you seem so self-centered I doubt if you could ever be really concerned about anybody and their troubles . WALLIS Well , I 'll tell you , Sweetheart . I love me , and I also love others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TERESA I can believe that  --  But why do we have to be so many miles apart ? We both can sing !  --  Why ca n't we see eye to eye ? WALLIS Do you mean because I say I want to be Champ someday ? TERESA I know I sound like some kind of Shrew bringing it up  --  especially , when you 've told me how you wanted to kill your father for insisting on you being an engineer . But I ca n't help it . ( HENNY enters right ) WALLIS You do n't understand  --  ( Greeting Henny ) Hi , beautiful ! HENRY ( Greeting BOTH ) Hi !  --  Gim me a couple of lamb chops . WALLIS ( Going to meat case ) You bet ! ( Going on to Teresa ) You see , Honey , the folks around St. Albans do n't know it . But I 'm really good with my Dukes . I never told you because I did n't want you to get the idea I 'm a boaster . But I used to be Champ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the record , some day I 'm going to take the Lightweight Crown  --  ( Laughing ) You 're going to see me up there with Floyd Patterson and Sugar Ray and those boys , where I can make me some money ! ( To HENNY ) That 'll be 74. p. 9 TERESA ( As HE wraps chops and the GIRL fishes for correct change ) What 's so glorious about money ? WALLIS ( Laughing ) Why , Lady , have n't you heard ? Money 's like the H-bomb : Open any door in the world ! HENRY ( Paying him ) Lord , you told that right ! TERESA ( Arresting her as she starts out though addressing HIM sharply ) But there 're a 180 million people in the United States , and only one Champion . You might as well be foolish enough to think you 've a chance to be President ! WALLIS ( Laughing ) I guess it does sound crazy  --  ( He exhibits muscles ) But when a man 's got that kind of muscle , and knows how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's all over but the shouting ! HENRY ( Going ) Boy , you 're something else ! TERESA ( Laughing ) You wait until somebody knocks his block off ! ( Exit HENNY right ) WALLIS ( Laughing ) Oh , I do n't say I ca n't be whipped . But you can bet one thing : the guy who whips me is going to be awful tired ! p. 10 TERESA ( Firmly ) I still say fighting 's no comparison with what you could do with your voice ! WALLIS Singers are a dime a dozen  --  present company excepted , of course . ( Laughing ) I want me some of everything this modern world can afford , including a glass house with all the gimmicks  --  I want a Lincoln Continental and a Cadillac in my two-car garage  --  And I want you to have your own maid , and be waited on like Mrs. Carson , while you have your breakfast in bed . TERESA ( Indignantly ) You talk just like my folks . Papa insisted on me going to Normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the little money Grandpa left me and came up here . I wanted to go to college . But it was n't enough . My credits was n't acceptable nohow  --  So I took this job where I make my own living and can pay for my lessons in the bargain . Now my Aunt Edwina thinks I 'm wasting my time . None of you seem to understand : Things are different today for Negroes . We do n't need to depend on Hurok to book us only one at the time anymore ! Two-thirds of the world is Colored , and becoming more independent every day . Soon they 're going to be asking for people like us . But you do n't get the picture , and neither does she , and the big joke is she knows nothing about music . She may recognize Dorthy Maynor 's voice , or Marion Anderson 's . But she thinks Nina Simone 's or Mahalia Jackson 's just as good ! p. 11 WALLIS In other words , we 're all dumb ! TERESA It 's your attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably in a few years we could form us a team like Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald . We could sing our way all over the world . But your heart is set on money  --  But I 'm not interested in any glass house , or having my breakfast in bed either . Perhpas to outsiders , Mrs. Carson 's life may look great . But I happen to know she could n't be more unhappy . She ca n't even stand an egg on her stomach in the morning , unless it 's in a Gin Fizz . She 's so bored the rest of the day I have to keep the shaker filled with cocktails , and what 's worse , she ca n't even lie down with her husband when it 's time to go back to bed without taking one for the road .  --  That 's not for me . I want to make something of my life . And I tell you now , if you ca n't understand that , you 'll never understand my love  --  ( Darkly ) or anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it together . WALLIS You just think I do n't understand you , Sweetheart . But I do . In fact , I 'd hang for you . But I just happen to know what I can do in the ring , and how easy it 'll make things for both of us . TERESA ( Going , unhappily ) You 'll never understand what I 'm talking about . p. 12 WALLIS Oh , Honey , do n't leave me like this . TERESA I 'll see you tonight . WALLIS ( Following her to door ) OK  --  I 'll be by as soon as I get cleaned up . ( SHE disappears off Left ) ( HE follows her retreat , then still unaware of the seriousness of her attitude , he sings , light-heartedly : " SOME DAY SHE 'LL DROP THIS SWEET DECEPTION " ) ALTHOUGH SHE KEEPS ME AT A DISTANCE , AS THOUGH SHE REALLY DOES N'T CARE , SOME DAY SHE 'LL DROP THIS SWEET DECEPTION AND SEE I 'M REALLY ON THE SQUARE ! SOME DAY SHE 'LL DROP THIS SWEET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : THE ONE AND ONLY SENT FROM HEAVEN TO RULE THIS EAGER HEART OF ME ! OH , I MAY BE NAIVE OR JUST A FOOL , BUT WE SHALL BE TOGETHER SOON , AS SURELY AS THE HANDS ON A CLOCK MEET TOGETHER AT NOON  --  HIGH NOON ! SOME DAY SHE 'LL DROP THIS SWEET DECEPTION AND GIVE HER SHY , DEAR HEART TO ME , THEN SHE WILL WONDER WHY SHE WAITED WHEN ALL THE TIME IT HAD TO BE !

What 's wrong with you ? DRAG ( Sore ) You act like this bottle 's your Mama 's titty ! DRIFT Damn that  --  Don you never snatch nothin out-er my hand --  We run out-er sherry we buy some more ! DRAG ( Noticing bag and its contents behind the other , where dozens of packs of currency has spilled  --  the sight of which sends cold chills up his spine , as , in a flash , his wine befogged brain staggers before the immensity of the sum and prospects of awe-inspiring wealth . HE stammers in actual momentary terror ) Gaaaaaaawwwwwwddddd dammmmmmmmmmnnnnn ! p. 14 DRIFT ( Suddenly afraid to turn ) Whaaaaat 's th ... th ... matter with you ? DRAG Look ... down there behind you ... DRIFT What ... what is it ? DRAG ( Sotto voce ) It 's bread , Man ! DRIFT ( In awe as he turns ) Jesus Christ ! That ca n't be money !

DRIFT There 's twenty in this one ! DRAG Twenty ? Then that 's a $1,000 . DRIFT ( Rising ) A thousand dollars ... ? DRAG ( Working furiously ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

DRAG Hell , yes  - -  -  Put ' em in piles of ten , so we can count em . DRIFT Boy , your Mama did n't send you to school for nothing , did she ? DRAG ( Arranging piles ) Hell , no ... DRIFT Boy , this here is the same as being in the vault at the bank ! DRAG ( Counting piles ) Who you hunching ?  - -  -  1,2,3,4,5,6,7  --  That 's $70,000 right there . DRIFT ( Staggered ) $70,000 , dollars --  ? p. 16 DRAG Hell , yes  --  But wait . Lemme count the rest  --  ( Pulls pile over ) That makes $80,000  - -  -  DRIFT ( Shoving balance toward him ) And seven packs here ! DRAG Then that 's $87,000 altogether .

FAY ( Fearfully ) Where ? DRIFT They run under these crates ... FAY You do n't suppose they 're still there ? DRIFT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continuing her inspection warily ) It 's probably the nest  --  I had no idea there was so much debris down here . I think you 'd better get rid of it . DRAG Yes 'm .

Use the front door and see that it 's locked securely . p. 18 DRIFT Yes 'm . FAY ( Approaching jacket again ) Now do n't forget . See that the latch fastens , as there may be prowlers about .

DRIFT Then quit here , and move . WALLIS ( Thoughtfully ) What you need is somebody with money of their own  --  Some businessman . p. 27 DRAG Ain ' none we could trust . DRIFT I got a idea . You take the Bread , Battler , and open one . WALLIS A business ? DRIFT Sure , Man . You smart . You got a good education ! WALLIS ( Intrigued ) You 're crazy  --  Everybody knows I 'm broke . DRIFT But it do n't have to be big . Just something to get by with , maybe like a shoeshine parlor . DRAG Solid Jack ! DRIFT It 's cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow , shine shoes .

It is early evening , and the rest of the Cafe is darkened . But light spilling from the bar and archway , leading into it proper , reveals the semi-amphitheatre-like interior . There are three levels of tables and chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the levels and along each side of a passage , leading up , in the Center . Down Right , a small piano with a tiny performing area beside it . Above , in the background , a large , painted Red Rooster , in the act of crowing , hovers over all . In a moment , JESSYE  --  an attractive brown-skinned woman of 35 , in an expensive linen suit , enters from the archway . HOP ( Greeting Jessye ) Hi , Boss ! JESSYE Hi ! What was the Number ? HOP 3 , 8 , 6  --  so I heard . JESSYE ( Disappointed ) Umph , Umph , Umphmm ! and I had $16 on 3 , 8 , 7  --  One damn figure ! What does a poor gal need to get herself a loaf of bread ?

CURTAIN p. 50 p. 51 Act 1 , Scene 5 ACT I Scene 5 THE KITCHENETTE OF THE GRANTS . TIME : The same evening . A soft light on table leaves the room in somber glow , revealing a couch with companion chairs , a rug and TV . A DOOR on Right , opens on the outside hall , and another Up-Left in the corner leads to the bed-room and kitchen . TERESA is seen at window , on that side , gazing through its crisp whitelace curtain . TERESA ( Singing in an air of sadness ) NO DOUBT I 'M NOT THE FIRST GAL TO SETTLE FOR A GUY , WHILE ALL THE TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " GOD KNOWS HE 'S LIKE THE SWEETNESS OF A HONEYSUCKLE STEM , AND SWEARS I 'M SO " WAY OUT , " I 'M SIMPLY TOPS WITH HIM !

( EDWINA appears from rear to stand listening in amazement ) OH , BUT IT 'S HARD TO FATHOM WHY LIFE SHOULD TRAP ONE SO A WORD CAN BRING DISASTER FROM ONE WHOM YOU ADORE ! p. 52 EDWINA ( Coming down , seeing tears ) Goodness gracious me ! What 's the matter , child ? Do n't tell me again there ai n't something wrong ! TERESA I guess I 've got the blues , Aunt . EDWINA Teresa , I 'm too old to be fooled . Something 's troubling you and I think you should tell me  --  That 's what I 'm here for  --  What your Daddy expects of me  - -  -  ( The phone rings and she pauses , then commands ) Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Going to phone ) I guess I was n't paying any attention  --  ( On phone ) The Grant 's residence ... Oh , Wallis . I was just thinking about you  - -  -  ( Suddenly excited ) What 's that ? ... Oh , not really ! ( Distracted from her secret she turns to her aunt elatedly ) Aunt Edwina , you know what ? Wallis has just won $85,000 on the races ! EDWINA ( Happily surprised ) Child , you do n't mean it ! TERESA ( On phone ) Oh , Wallis , that 's wonderful  --  ! ( Suddenly remembering she goes on in subdued tone ) I mean it opens everything for you ... No , I 'm really glad  --  Why should n't I be ... ? You are ? ( To Edwina ) He says he 's giving a champagne party for me tonight , and he wants you to come ... ? p. 53 EDWINA Tell him " yes , " Honey  --  I should say so ! TERESA ( On phone ) She says it 's OK ... Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting ... Oh , but is n't that expensive ?  --  ( To Edwina ) He 's bought a new Cadillac ! ... EDWINA Lord , he is flying high  --  A Cadillac ! TERESA ( Hanging up ) I most certainly do want to see it , and I 'd better not catch another woman in it ... I mean that  --  Bye now . ( As she turns away from phone ) Oh , this is awful ! EDWINA What 'd you mean it 's awful , and him winning all that money ? TERESA I know he 's going to ask me to marry him . EDWINA What else do you expect ? He 's crazy about you ! TERESA Yes . But I 'm not ready for it . EDWINA ( Chuckling ) I know ' t is a little frightening . But Honey , your part is short . All you 've got to do is say " yes . " TERESA You do n't understand  --  though I suppose now I 'd better tell you . EDWINA You mean what 's been bothering you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all . EDWINA What is it ? TERESA I 've gotten myself in a mess . But I do n't want you to get upset about it . If you 're going to help me , it 's got to be tonight . EDWINA What sort of mess , Teresa ? TERESA I 'm going to have a baby . EDWINA ( In sudden pain ) Oh , Honey  - -  -  not you ! TERESA But it 's all right , Aunt Edwina . It 's not the baby  --  If it was , I 'd have told you before , believe me . It 's Wallis I 'm worried about . Now that he 's got the money , I know he 'll propose , and I do n't know what , if anything , to tell him . EDWINA ( Outraged ) You do n't mean it ai n't his ? TERESA I only wish it was . EDWINA Then whose is it ? TERESA Julian Mars ... EDWINA The landlord's -- - ? TERESA Yes . EDWINA My God ! Teresa what kind of person are you ? How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boy ? p. 55 TERESA That 's not true . It happened before I ever met Wallis  --  EDWINA Does Percy Mars know about the baby ? TERESA Yes . EDWINA Then what 'd he have to say ? TERESA He 's got a wife . So he tried to pay me off . He offered me the deed to one of his houses over on Rockaway  --  which he said would take care of us . I told him he knew what he could do with it ! EDWINA But why ? Surely you 've sense enough to know it 's no joke to raise a fatherless child ! TERESA After the dirty way he treated me , I wanted him to know I was n't going to stoop that low and let him rob me of my self-respect on top of it . He may have tricked me , but he 'll never live to see the day when I 'll be beholden to him for any favor . EDWINA How do you mean , hettricked you ? You knew he was out of your class  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So clever , I never knew what was happening until it was too late . From the start he misled me to think he was seriously interested . Then he pretended he 'd arranged with Copper Records to bring out an Album featuring me . He arranged for me to meet him there for an audition , and they claimed they liked my voice so well they 'd make the recording as soon as they could locate the right songs for me to sing . To make it all look even better , Percy gave them a check for $500 . But it was all understood as part of the game to deceive me . Afterwards , he took me to dinner then up to his apartment where he said I 'd meet some Disc-Jockeys and others who could help push the Album once it came out . He knew after all he was supposed to have done for me , under the circumstances I 'd be afraid to offend him , especially since I knew nothing about his wife  --  So it happened . p. 56 EDWINA That dirty dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . TERESA But I do n't want to get rid of it . EDWINA Do n't talk like a fool ! TERESA It 's mine . I 've a right to it . EDWINA That boy wo n't think so . TERESA I ca n't help that . EDWINA But surely you do n't believe he 's going to be content to let you saddle him with another man 's child ? TERESA He will if he loves me . EDWINA You 're making a terrible mistake !  --  What about your plans to sing ? How do you expect to do that , burdened with a child ? TERESA Other women have done so . EDWINA Yes , and for every one who did , there 's a thousand who failed . TERESA I know , Aunt . I 've had time to consider it all . But I can see very well , I would n't be much of a woman to Wallis nor myself and my career either , if I destroyed the baby . Why should I anyway ? Who 's to say a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been imposed upon ? What sort of person would I be , asking people to come in and hear me sing and respect me , after murdering my own child ? Ca n't you see it would be monstrous ? It 's my duty to protect life , not destroy it . p. 57 EDWINA That 's all very well , Child , and I think I understand you . But you 'll find , it 's a much different story in the eyes of the world . Out there right do n't mean much , and suffering is the price you pay for good intentions . TERESA I 'm only concerned about Wallis . I know he loves me . But do you think now that he 's got the money , he 'll be able to understand my real feelings toward him , as well as my desire to keep the baby ? Or will he think I just want a husband because I 've ruined my life ? EDWINA I think it 's best to keep your mouth shut , and if he asks you , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say you love him . TERESA I could n't be such a crook . Yet , I would keep my mouth shut , rather than run the risk of losing him altogether by telling him now , if I thought it was right to do it because I love him and believe we 'll be good for one another ... ? EDWINA I 'm afraid I ca n't answer that . TERESA Do you mean you wo n't or do n't know ? EDWINA No . It 's just too deep for me . All I can tell you is you 'll have to abide by your own conscience . TERESA ( Rising ) Then I suppose we 'd better be getting ready . It 's time now he was here . p. 58 EDWINA No . You get dressed . I could n't enjoy any party  --  Not with the load you 've given me . TERESA I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to burden you  --  Everything just came up so suddenly , and I 've been so distressed . EDWINA I understand , Honey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TERESA ( Going ) He was so happy on the phone , I think if he does ask me , I 'll make him wait . It would n't be fair to spoil things , not tonight .

At the party you were so happy and gay . Now you act like I did you wrong somehow , when all I want you to do is marry me ! TERESA It is n't easy for me to say this , Wallis . I 'm ready to devote my life to you . If it 's humanly possible , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to face losing you . WALLIS But how can you , knowing I want you for my wife !

WALLIS ( In despair ) And I thought you was the greatest ! p. 80 TERESA ( Pained ) I tried , believe me . But you do n't know the kind of men a girl can run into in this world .

I could 've kept my mouth shut , and you 'd probably never 've known the difference  --  Surely that must count as to how I really feel about you . WALLIS ( Bitterly uncomforted ) Ha !

TERESA You 're not considering my feelings . WALLIS ( Angrily ) What about mine ? I got feelings too ! TERESA Yes . But the baby deserves some consideration , too .  --  Maybe you 'd rather break my heart . But I 'm not going to destroy it ! WALLIS Well , I am not going for any such old-fashioned ideas as that . TERESA But , Wallis , night after night and all day through , I 've thought about it . This is just in your mind . The baby ca n't hurt you as long as I love you  --  What I 'm asking is only fair ! p. 82 WALLIS Oh , yeah ? Well , they say fair exchange is no robbery . ( Going on to bring matters to a head ) You say you love me like I love you . I do n't like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can quit your job and we 'll both go to school . When we finish , we can form the team , like you said  --  and sing around the world  --  Miss Boyd and me are opening a Tavern , and she can pay my share to Drift and Drag , which will take care of them  --  So with the rest of the money , we can do as we please . But you get rid of the baby ! TERESA No , Wallis . It ca n't be like that . WALLIS Do n't talk crazy ! You know I got the money ! TERESA I 've told you all along ; money does n't matter to me . WALLIS In other words , you just do n't care ! TERESA ( Rising ) No . You simply refuse to understand  --  I 'm going in . Maybe later when you 've thought about it , you 'll see me as I am . God knows I ca n't be otherwise  --  In the meantime , you 'll know where to find me . WALLIS ( Desperately ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting , I 'm not asking you to do anything I would n't do for you . TERESA No . But you do n't see , the baby ca n't change me . Whatever I was when you met me , I still am . But if you do n't think so , we 'll never be happy together . p. 83 WALLIS But , Girl , I ca n't give you up . I love you too much . TERESA Below your belt , yes  --  That 's what 's bothering you . But someday you 'll learn a woman 's got more than sex to offer . If not , then I do n't know the meaning of love .

I 'm going to level with you boys . We 've got your pal , Thunderbird Brown , on the grill outside . But , truthfully , we 've no case against him . He 's got an ironclad alibi , which we ca n't break unless you 'll testify . DRIFT What alibi ? RYAN He claims he made a killing at the track , and he can prove he was working . So we may have to cut him loose . But you fellows know what happened  - -  -  We 've witnesses you were on the premises , and as you see , we 've got the dough .

We found that li'l bread you took from us , like we told you . RYAN ( Easily ) Well , you think about it . It 's OK by me . I thought I 'd give you a break  --  Get you , say , 6 months on the Island . But if you 'd rather let yourselves be imposed upon  --  You can see for yourselves , Fenelli 's got enough to bury you .

WALLIS But how  --  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me to hide at Mrs. Carson 's  --  But instead of me going straight out there like I was told , I stopped by Aunt 's to tell her where I was going , and the Police was there . WALLIS And they arrested you ? TERESA Yes . They took my ring . And then they turned me loose just now ... Because , they said , they knew you were just using me . But they want me to testify . WALLIS Miss Boyd had no business giving it to you . TERESA She could n't help it . She said she was afraid the police would make you talk , and she could n't afford to be arrested on account of her kid . p. 103 WALLIS Damn , I can see now I 'm sunk . TERESA Do n't say that . I 'm sorry about my part . But I got you a lawyer  --  WALLIS You did ? TERESA Yes . Attorney Wilks . Miss Boyd gave me a $1,000 to hire him .

The Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . But I thought I was the smart one . I should 've turned ' em down when they asked me to keep it . I was to be the big manager  --  ( Seeing HER in tears again ) Do n't now , Teresa  --  Dry your eyes and forget it . ( Regretfully ) I guess greed got the best of me , and I was too smart to let well-enough alone ... Drift back there wanted me to open a shoeshine parlor . But no . He was just a dumb " wino , " while I had all the brains . I could outwit the whole town . One big lie and I 'd have it made . I 'd belong . Be a Big Shot . Maybe get back in the ring and make myself a head-liner overnight  --  Well , now I 'll be Champ all right  --  Middleweight Champ of Sing Sing ! ( Regretfully ) Like last night .

You trusted me . So did them fellows back there , Drift and Drag . I know it 's no excuse , but I never meant to harm any of you . Now all I can say : I hope you 'll forgive and forget what a crumb I turned out to be . p. 105 TERESA ( In tears , quietly ) Wallis , I understand . It just hurts to see what you 've done to yourself . But , like Mama used to say , I 'm not the one to forgive you ; you have to forgive yourself and try to do better next time . WALLIS ( As SHE sobs ) Please , Teresa . I do n't deserve a tear drop from your eyes . Just tell me goodbye and go on home . I 'm sorry about your ring , as I 'd sure been glad if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do like I said : wipe me out of your mind . TERESA ( Bracing herself ) I see you still do n't know me , after all . WALLIS Why do you say that ? TERESA ( Smiling she sings ambivalently : " I AM THE SORT OF GIRL WHO NEVER LOVES BUT ONCE " ) ALTHOUGH MY HEART IS BREAKING , AND I MAY BE JUST A DUNCE , I 'M THE SORT OF GIRL WHO NEVER LOVES BUT ONCE ! IT HURTS TO SEE YOU SO , BUT I WILL NOT DESPAIR  --  MY HEART IS LIKE A VAULT AND I SHALL KEEP YOU THERE ! PERHAPS I 'M LIKE THE PALM WHICH NEVER BLOOMS BUT ONCE , HOWEVER THAT MAY BE , I AM YOUR PERFECT DUNCE !

JUDGE ( Wearily ) Gentlemen , it is getting late and my patience is very nearly exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break for lunch . DISTRICT ATTORNEY Your Honor , this last on the docket is merely a request for arraignment , requiring only a few minutes . JUDGE Is the complainant present ? COLTON Your Honor , I am Henry Colton , Counsel for the Complainant , whom I am expecting any moment . JUDGE The Clerk will dispense with reading of the Information and accept the plea . p. 108 CLERK Higgins , Parks and Brown , you 're charged with Second Degree Burglary  --  How do you plead ? WILKS Not guilty . COLTON ( Noticing BALDWIN at rail on Right ) If it please the Court , the complainant has arrived  --  ( Seeing BALDWIN beckon , he joins him ) We 're just getting underway  --  BALDWIN ( Sotto voce  --  Obviously perturbed ) Drop it ! COLTON ( Sotto voce ) The case ? BALDWIN Yes . Call it off ! JUDGE Perhaps Counsel will explain the meaning of this interruption ? COLTON One moment , Your Honor  --  ( To Baldwin ) But it 's airtight ! BALDWIN ( Annoyed ) Never mind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the Court ? BALDWIN Anything  --  Only drop it !

( He exits ) COLTON ( Approaching bench ) If it please the Court , there has apparently been an error committed in the Information before Your Honor  --  DISTRICT ATTORNEY ( Springing up ) How 's that ? COLTON My client informs me that there has been no such crime committed against his property ! DISTRICT ATTORNEY ( Sharply ) Your Honor , the State demands an explanation ! COLTON If the District Attorney will allow me ; I have no alternative but to withdraw . DISTRICT ATTORNEY If it please the Court , the State is prepared to offer irrefutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILKS ( Interposing ) Objection ! If it please the Court , the Defense moves for dismissal for lack of complaint , and respectfully requests that Your Honor also instruct the Property Custodian to restore the property taken from the Defendants and presumed to be offered here as evidence . p. 110 DISTRICT ATTORNEY Objection . Your Honor , the police department can not have been mistaken . It has succeeded in amassing overwhelming evidence that the sum of some $87,000 was unlawfully removed from the premises ; and if the process of justice is to be defeated , and in a manner bordering on complicity , we , who have sworn to uphold the laws of this State , might as well resign en masse ! JUDGE While the Court is in sympathy with the sentiments expressed by the District Attorney , and would add its commendation to the Police Department for its quick and efficient apprehension of the alleged culprits , we have no alternative under the law but to grant the plea for dismissal .
