txt // solved the difficulties of the railways . In spite of the restrictions on road transport the railways were forced to look to tariff changes as a way of combatting the ever-growing competition from the roads . The rise of competition was in itself no reason for abandoning the old principle of railway rate making . If it were really true that only a small part of railway costs was identifiable with the provision of particular services there would still be no basis for relating charges to costs . Charges would still have had to be based on what the traffic would bear , although the application of that principle would have been greatly altered by the existence of competition . But with the need radically to alter railway tariffs a fresh look was taken at the nature of railway costs and it came to be accepted that they were far more identifiable with the provision of particular services than had been believed . As a result of railway costing studies it became clear that the railways ' financial difficulties arose in part from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different traffics.i This variation in costs was not reflected in any corresponding variation in charges and , in consequence , some traffics were being carried at entirely unremunerative rates . The subsidization of these traffics and its financial effects had been concealed during the time when no attention was given to the costs of particular traffics , and when the absence of effective competition allowed the cross-subsidization of unremunerative by remunerative traffics . When much of the highly profitable traffics had been lost to road transport , however , the railways could no longer afford this cross-subsi-dization , and they could no longer afford to neglect the relation-ship between charges and costs . Most railways throughout the world ? and this applies particularly in America and Great Britain ? which are faced with the problem of competition , are now placing emphasis on the " cost of service " basis in fixing rates ' .2 If events have forced railway administrations to a realization that they must face competition by relating their charges to their COSTS AND PRICES 2I costs , can it be said that they have therefore also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies that reflect the social interest ? If a railway takes account of its costs in fixing its charges for particular services , will competition between road and rail ensure a division of traffic between them which minimizes the social cost of transport ? An answer to this question will emerge from an analysis of the cost structures of road and of rail transport and of the differing circumstances in which the two transport agencies operate . It will appear that there are serious difficulties in the way of the competitive solution ' to the problem of obtaining an economic distribution of traffic between road and rail . Before consideration is given to the costs incurred by railways and road hauliers in providing transport , it is necessary to point out that these costs do not constitute the whole cost of transport . I n addition to the costs incurred by the transporter there are costs which fall on the user . The total cost of transporting a commodity will consist not only , for example , of the costs in ( urred by the railway in a station-to-station haul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the goods to and from the stations . This fact is simple and obvious , but it is of some importance in the economics of transport for the reason that the user 's cost may vary widely according to the traffic and to the transport agency used . The transporter 's costs for a particular haul may be lower by rail than by road , but if this difference is more than made up by a higher level of user 's cost , if rail is used instead of road , the road is in fact the lower cost means of transport . The lowest cost f rnl of transport is that for which the sum of user 's and transportcr 's costs is the lowest . If he is given a choice , a customer will not necessarily select the transport agency which makes the lowest charge , because the advantage of the lower charge may be more than offset by a higher level of user 's costs . It was stated at the beginning of this chapter that the economic cost of a product represents the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost to society in using resources to produce some particular product , which would otherwise have been used ( or usable ) for producing something else . Most productive resources are capable of being put to a number of alternative uses , and their commitment to any one use involves the sacrifice of ' what they could have produced in other uses . The economic // cost of a given product , therefore , consists in the sacrificed opportunity for producing something else , and it is conveniently referred to as the opportunity cost ' . It follows from what has just been said that productive resources enter into the economic cost of transport only if they have an alternative use . Resources which are specific to a particular use have no opportunity cost . Many resources are specific for short periods . The capital embodied in railway wagons , for instance , can be used only to carry railway freight . The use of the wagons is costlessl if it is envisaged only during the short-period of the life of the existing wagons . The use of the wagons has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the long-period , beyond the life of the existing assets . If the services of the stock of wagons are to be available in the long-period , the existing wagons will have to be replaced at the end of their useful life . Non-specific capital resources will then have to be committed to this particular use , and the alternative uses of the capital will have to be forgone . The economic cost of providing a transport service , therefore , may vary according to the length of time for which the provision of the service is envisaged , the cost in the long-period being greater than that in the short-period . It is convenient to measure the value of productive resources in terms of the price that has to be paid for them . Where this procedure is valid , the economic cost of providing a service is indicated by the conventional accounting measure of its money cost . The expense incurred by the transporter measures the opportunity cost of the resources used . This procedure is not always valid , however , and then the accountant 's measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One basis for divergence between accounting cost and economic cost has already been mentioned . There is no economic cost in using specific capital assets , if their eventual replacement is not en-visaged . But interest and amortization on the capital embodied in railway rolling stock will be considered as a cost by the accountant ( rightly , from his point of view ) , even though there may be no opportunity cost in the use of the rolling stock . Similarly , there is no opportunity cost in the use of permanent ' assets which do not wear out , such as , perhaps , the embankments and cuttings on a // railway route , but the charges on the capital embodied in such assets are a cost to the accountant . Another basis for divergence between economic and accounting cost arises when there is a divergence between private ' and social ' cost because of the existence of external diseconomies ' ( or economies ) . The private accounting cost of a particular road haul could be worked out in terms of the expenditure on wages , petrol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the haul is made on a congested road the economic cost may be far higher than the private accounting cost . The additional vehicle on the road increases the costs of all other road users because it increases the congestion , but these costs , because they fall on others , do not appear in the accounting measure of the cost of the haul . Again , if the use of the road by a heavy or fast vehicle damages the road surface and as a result increases the costs of other road users , the true social or economic cost of the use of the vehicle may greatly exceed the private accounting measure of ' the cost.l Given these possibilities of divergence between economic cost and accounting cost , and given the fact that there are users ' costs in addition to transporters ' costs , there remains the question of the extent to which the economic cost of providing a particular transport service can be identified within the various expenses incurred by a transporter . If prices are to be based on cost this identification is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly divided into those which vary more or less directly with the amount of traffic carried , and which increase or decrease when there is even a relatively small increase or decrease in traffic , and those which do not vary when there are relatively small variations in the volume of traffic , but which may vary when there is a large variation in traffic . The former category may be called direct costs ' and the latter indirect costs ' . The direct costs may them-selves be divided into those which are a function of the length of journey , on the one hand , and ' terminal costs ' which are inde-pendent of distance , on the other . // British Railways make the distinction between costs of opera-tion , based on reasonably firm foundations of fact ' and costs consisting of administrative overheads and the cost of track and traffic buildings which can only be apportioned arbitrarily ' .1 They argue that in the long term , important changes in traffic volumes can be expected to cause equivalent changes in the size of the apparatus giving rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost corresponds fairly closely to that of the long-term marginal cost of the system or service as a whole . ' 1 But this can not be taken to mean that indirect costs are entirely invariant with respect to the volume of traffic ; if traffic increases beyond a certain point the capacity of the track , for example , has to be increased . It seems best , therefore , to think of the difference between direct and indirect costs as being determined by the difference in the magnitude of the change in traffic which is necessary to affect them . It is obvious that this two-part classification into direct and indirect cost is an over-simplification . In practice there will not be a clear distinction between elements of cost which vary in proportion with traffic and those which are fixed except for large changes in the volume of traffic . In general , the change in costs engendered by a change in traffic will depend on the size of the change and the length of the view taken . For very small changes in the short period the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the extra passenger on a train that is not full and is scheduled to make the journey is negligible . Similarly , the marginal cost of the last parcel on the tail of the lorry may be virtually nil , but for the first parcel it is very great ' .1 It is clearly difficult to imagine that the short-run costs for very small units of traffic can provide a useful basis for the formulation of transport policy . However , the costing of broad and regular streams of traffic and patterns of operation is another matter and provides information which is vital to the formulation of a unified and rational charging policy for transport . ' 1 In ascertaining the cost of a particular transport service , therefore , a certain amount of averaging is inevitable . But if charges are to be based on cost the averaging must not be carried too far . If the costs of particular traffics are to be estimated to provide // a basis for charges it is necessary to identify the main determinants of cost . The traditional railway tariff implicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . Commodities were classified according to their value , and within any rate class t he charge for a particular haul was determined by the length of the haul and the weight to be carried . No other differences in the circumstances of particular traffics affected the charge per tonmile . Distance and weight , although they are important determinants of the cost of any haul , are not the only influences on cost . The cost of traffics of identical ton-mileage will differ widely according to the differing incidence of other determinants of cost . One of the most important additional determinants of the cost of : a particular haul is the extent to which the carrying capacity of the wagons is utilized . This will in part depend on the loadability ' of the commodity . A light , bulky commodity will cost more per ton-mile than a commodity which is of small bulk in relation to its weight , because a smaller weight of it can be lorded into a rail wagon or a lorry . The utilization achieved in practice does not , however , depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its physical characteristics . It depends also on the size of the units in which the traffic is habitually offered . Even though the physical characteristics of a particular commodity are such that as much weight of it can be loaded as the wagon or lorry can carry , so that full wagon loads are feasible , if shippers normally offer the commodity in much smaller weights , and there is nothing else with which the excess capacity in the wagon can be filled , the achieved wagon loading will be relatively low and the traffic will be relatively high-cost . The higher the wagon-loading achieved the lower , other things being equal , will be the cost per ton-mile . And traffics for which not only full wagon loading but also full train loading is achieved will cost less per ton-mile than traffics the carriage of which involves trains in running with less than capacity loads . Two further examples of the influence on cost of the extent to which equipment is operated to capacity warrant specific mention . Imbalances in the direction of traffic flow and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other equipment . If the traffic between A and B exceeds that between B and A there is of necessity empty haulage between B // and A. There is an empty return haul ' of wagons which were needed to carry the traffic between A and B , and this haulage is a cost of that traffic . Traffic which involves empty return haulage is more costly than traffic for which no such special provision of wagons is required . A given ton-mileage of traffic may be more costly if it has all to be carried over a short period of time than if it is evenly distributed through the year , because there may be excess capacity in rolling stock and other equipment during the rest of the year . ' The cost of a particular haul will also depend upon whether or not it is a through-haul . Transhipment is costly , and a given ton-mileage will be cheaper for a through-haul than for a haul in which transhipment is necessary . One particular example of this point is that rail costs will be lower for traffics which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have to be transported to the railway and transhipped . The terrain through which the journey is made is another factor influencing costs , for it affects both running costs and the cost of capital works such as the construction of the road or track . The costs of both road and rail transport are affected by the influences just described , but they are not affected equally . For example , in general the capacity of a transport unit is smaller in road than in rail transport , so that road transport is likely to be less affected than rail by excess capacity because full capacity loading is more easily achieved . On the other hand , the large capacity available in rail transport makes the railway a low-cost carrier of large and regular flows of traffic . Terminal costs are relatively greater in rail than in road , so that the railways are relatively cheaper for long hauls , over which the terminal costs can be spread , than for short haul traffic . The characteristics of the two forms of transport tend to give each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Transport Commission 's assessment of the relative costs of probably of some general applicability . In their view2 the cost of rail transport is likely to be // lower than the cost of road transport and vice versa , according to conditions as follows : Table I t is not sensible to ask whether in general road or rail is the lower cost means of transport ; the question can be sensibly asked and answered only in relation to particular traffics over particular routes . The answer will vary according to the traffic and the route , and charges based on costs should reflect these variations . There are important differences in the circumstances in which rail and road transporters operate which affect their ability to determine the relationship between their charges and their costs . The total costs incurred by the railway consist of direct costs , which are identifiable with the provision of particular services , and indirect costs which can not be identified in this way but which are incurred in the course of providing the railway 's services as a whole . Once the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial interest of the railway administration that the charge for any service is not less than the direct cost of providing it . The way charges are set at a higher level than this minimum so as to cover indirect costs is , however , subject to a wide measure of discretion . It is open to the railway administration , and it will be profitable for them , to raise the charges for particular traffics above the level of direct cost according to what the traffic will bear . In general , such a policy would mean that the traffics which make the most contribution to indirect costs are those which are least subject to road competition . For traffics where road competition is severe charges ' v i11 be set down to a minimum equal to direct cost . The ability of a railway to charge discriminatory prices has been severely limited , it has been pointed out , by the rise of road competition , // but it has not been eliminated . The degree of competition to which the railway is subject differs widely for different traffics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two forms of transport . The railway is therefore able to discriminate in its charges against those traffics for which it has a direct cost advantage . Road hauliers operate in circumstances which are different in two respects from those of the railway . In the first place , a large part of the indirect costs of road transport is paid by road hauliers through taxation . The track ' costs of road transport , which comprise the bulk of its indirect costs , are met in the first instance by the government and are imposed on road transporters through taxation . To the extent that the tax is imposed on fuel , it appears to the road transporter as a direct cost . It will not , therefore , be profitable to attempt to meet this cost in any way other than by raising the charge for any particular ton-mile of traffic by the amount by which the tax falls on that ton-mile . It would not be profitable to attempt to cover it by discrimination , nor in fact would it be possible , for the second difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nature of the competition to which they are subject . The railway is subject to competition from road hauliers , but the pressure of competition will vary between traffics according to their suitability for rail or road . Road hauliers , however , face competition not only from the railway but also from other road hauliers . Road haulage tends to be a competitive industry of many relatively small firms , so that a road transporter is likely to be subject to competition more or less equally over the whole range of traffics . The intensity of competition will not vary sufficiently for it to be practicable to discriminate in the distribution of the burden of indirect costs over different traffics . For the two reasons , that the imposition of at least a part of indirect costs through a tax which constitutes a direct cost to the road haulier makes discriminatory pricing to cover that part of indirect costs unprofitable , and that the competitive situation makes discriminatory pricing to cover the remainder of indirect costs impossible , every traffic will be charged something more than the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and direct costs , if the railway set their charges in pursuit of their commercial interest , will vary according to the intensity // of competition for particular traffics , and some traffics may be charged only their direct cost . The social interest , it may be concluded , will not be satisfied by a policy which allows rail and road freely to compete for traffic , because the charges made for particular traffics by the two agencies will not bear the same relationship to direct costs . As a result , the traffics will not necessarily be carried by the agency which involves the least total use of productive resources . An economic distribution of traffic between road and rail will not be achieved unless matters are arranged so that their indirect costs are allocated between their various traffics in the same way . In practice , of course , road and rail are rarely , if ever , allowed freely to compete for traffic in pursuit of their commercial interests . Competition by road hauliers is restricted by licensing or other means , and railways are frequently subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all traffic offered . Not only are they prevented from picking and choosing their customers , they are also obliged to charge all customers the same for the same service . These obligations are a relic of the time when the monopolistic position of the railways made it necessary to protect the public from the danger of discriminatory treatment . They tend to limit the freedom of a railway to charge according to cost because traffics which are superficially similar , and which must therefore be treated similarly , vary widely in their cost . In addition to any formal common carrier obligations the freedom of railway administrations is restricted by the widespread view that the railways are a public service ' . This attitude makes it difficult for railway administrations to act in an entirely competitive and commercial fashion and to avoid providing unremunerative services.l Road hauliers do not appear to be Mr. Hill writes of the early days of the Kenya-Uganda Railway that .. the settlers ' attitude towards the railway as a social institution was not conducive to efficiency . On the one hand they required an ever-increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to treat the railway as a social institution . They would grumble if the trains were late and grumble all the more if the train did not stop to suit their whim or convenience .

The settlers were not very scrupulous over such matters as the purchase of tickets , which were frequently bought at the end of a journey , if at all . Indeed , one settler was credited with the classic achievement u1 ' reaching England on a second-class ticket from Nakuru to Elmenteita . ' Permanent Way , Vol . I , p. 340 . Although this quotation refers to passenger traffic it is not inapposite. // expected to behave in the same way , and this is a further reason why the competitive solution to the problem of road-rail coordination faces serious difficulties in the way of ensuring that competition takes place on a fair and equal ' basis . Most of the discussion so far has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all relevant to a study of the transport situation in East Africa , and they will be considered again in specifically East African terms in later chapters . CHAPTER IV ROAD AND RAIL CHARGES AND THE PROBLEM OF COMPETITION IN EAST AFRICA ( a ) THE RAILWAY TARIFF The structure of the East African railway tariff has broadly been that which would follow from the general principle of relating the charge to the value of the commodity . ) The charges have , how-ever , never been determined simply by what it was thought the traffic would bear , because tariff policy has never been deter-mined simply by the commercial interests of the railway , nor even by those interests within the constraints of regulations designed to prevent overcharging and undue preference . The railways in East Africa were not built for commercial reasons ; 2 and in their opera-tions they have been unable to neglect non-commercial con-siderations . The policy of the railways in fixing their charges has been intimately concerned with promoting the economic develop-ment of the territories . In 1923 , for example , the General Manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rates had to be set for imports because it was necessary to maintain sufficient revenue from import traffic to enable exports to be carried at the lowest possible rates in order to build up the agri-cultural industries of the colonies ' .3 At the present time , the statement of the tariff 's developmental function is found in the provision of the East African Railways and Harbours Act , that : // The Administration shall be administered on business principles and , so far as it is not inconsistent therewith or with the principles of prudent finance , cheap transport shall be provided by the Administration to assist agricultural , mining , and industrial , development in the Territories . ' 1 This provision is interpreted by the Railways Administration , despite the possibility of appeal to the principles of business and of prudent finance , as requiring them to operate a differential tariff ' in which the low rates given to assist agricultural , mining , and industrial development ' are balanced by high rates for other traffic . It is sometimes said that the low-rated traffic is charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual explanation of the differential tariff is that the lower than average rates charged for some traffics must be balanced by higher than average rates ' for others.3 There are two other features of the railway tariff which must be described , and which , incidentally , complicate the analysis of its structure . The rates are in general tapered ' with distance , so that the rate per ton-mile charged in a particular rate class falls with the distance of the haul . In Class 8 , for example , the charge for 50 miles amounts to 36.7 cents4 per ton-mile , whereas for a haul of I , 000 miles the charge is only 18.5 c.p.t.m . The second feature of the tariff is that there are substantial divergences between route mileage ' and chargeable mileage ' for some hauls . A minor example is that the chargeable mileage is the same for traffic between Tanga and Moshi as for that between Mombasa and Moshi , although the true distance is greater . The intention is to equalize the advantage , in this respect , of the two ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mileage and the route mileage are provided by many of the hauls between Uganda and Kenya , for which the former is much shorter than the latter . The origin of this feature of the tariff is to be found in the arrangements made when the railway was 1 Clause 21. 2 E.A.R . &; H. , The Railway 's Case Against Road Competition ' , 3rd February 1961 , submitted to the Tanganyika Licensing Authority . 3 Interim Report of the Committee Appointed to Examine the Transport Licensing Ordinance ( Madan Committee ) , Kenya Sessional Paper No. 2 of 1959/60 , para . 8. 4 1 cent = i as Shs . See Chapter II , p . Ion . // extended into Uganda in the late 1920s.1 The terminus of the railway had been at Kisumu , from where traffic was carried across the Lake to Uganda . The distance of this route to Uganda was shorter than that by rail , and the mileages of this shorter route were preserved as the chargeable mileages applicable to rail traffic between Uganda and Kenya when the through rail route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kampala , for instance , is 314 miles , which is the mileage of the route via Kisumu and Port Bell ; the route distance of the railway via Tororo is 426 miles.2 Further consideration is given to both these features of the tariff in later chapters . The structure of the tariff , with low rates for exports and high rates for imports , which was determined in the interest of agricul-tural development was , in fact , broadly similar to the structure that would have resulted from charging what the traffic would bear.3 The application of either principle is seriously affected by the rise of road transport . The 1930s saw the first adjustment of the railway tariff to counter road competition . The highest charge was reduced from well over a shilling a ton-mile to about 5o cents per ton-mile . Despite this drastic reduction in the maxi-mum rate , the differential in the tariff remained wide , low rates being charged for commodities of low value in relation to their bulk , with high rates for goods of high value , most of which were imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of six numbered rate classes , the lower numbered Classes being the higher rated , or to one of four lower-rated Special Classes ? has continued in operation , and much importance is still attributed to its developmental effects . But the policy of narrowing the differential in an attempt to counter road com-petition has also continued . The range of the differential tariff was // significantly reduced between 1957 and the introduction of the current tariff at the beginning of 196o . From October 1st 1957 the lower rates were raised while the rates of Classes 1 to 6 remained unchanged . The main narrowing of the differential took place at the beginning of 1959 . The maximum rate was cut to 40 c.p.t.m. , involving a reduction in charges for virtually all traffic in the first four rate classes , and there were also reductions for shorter distance traffics in Classes 5 to 7 . With a few excep-tions most other charges were raised by 5 per cent . At the begin-ning of 196o the maximum rate was cut to 38 c.p.t.m. , and Class 4 became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special charge for hauling empty petrol tank wagons was abolished making an effective reduction of about 1 o per cent in the petrol tariff . It is not easy to find a satisfactory general measure of the narrowing of the differential tariff . The measure that is some-times used of the range , from a minimum of 6 c.p.t.m. to a maximum of 6o c.p.t.m. in 1957 , compared with a minimum of 6 c.p.t.m. and a maximum of 38 c.p.t.m. in 196o , seems too simple-minded . Because it takes no account of the distribution of traffic the range indicates nothing about the effective differential.l Data on the average revenue per ton-mile for each rate class , as set out below in Table I , may appear to provide the basis for a more sophisticated comparison . But the appearance is deceptive , and the data in Table I do not provide much information about changes in the formal structure of the tariff . One difficulty about Table I is that the classification for 196o is different from that for earlier years , because the oil tanker traffic has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of average revenue per ton-mile is that they are a function not only of the tariff class but also , because of the existence of the taper , of the length of haul.2 It would clearly be possible in a tariff consisting of a number of tapered rates , for the effective charge to be the same in each rate class if the length of haul were longer in the high than in the low rated classes . In the present E.A.R . &; H. // tariff the rate in Class 6 at 65o miles ( 30.2 c.p.t.m. ) is virtually the same as Special Rate A at too miles ( 30 c.p.t.m. ) , although the rates in each class at the same distance show one to be a high and the other to be a low rate class . At 65o miles , for instance , the charge under Special Rate A is only 9.5 c.p.t.m. compared with the charge of 30.2 c.p.t.m. under Class 6 . Although the average revenue per ton-mile figures in Table I no doubt give generally the right impression of the changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of the changes , a fact which should be readily appreciated when it is noticed that for 1958 the average revenue per ton-mile is greater in Class 2 than in Class t . Another rough and ready indication of the narrowing of the differential is provided by a comparison of the proportions of total traffic and total revenue in particular rate classes . In 1957 Classes I to 4 contained 51. i per cent of the traffic measured in tonmiles , and yielded 16 per cent of the revenue . In I 96o they contained a little over 4 per cent of the traffic and yielded only a little over 8 per cent of the revenue . In 1957 Classes 1 ? 5 , and in I96o Classes 1 ? 5 plus Petrol , contained 14 per cent and 13 per cent respectively of the total traffic ; the revenue yielded by this traffic was 33 per cent of the total in 1957 and only 24 per cent of the total in 196o . But again , these figures provide no precise indication of the narrowing of the tariff differential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the length of haul as well as by changes in the tariff rates . The difficulty in comparing the tariffs arising from differences in lengths of haul would be avoided if the charges of the different years were compared for given mileages . But if this comparison took no account of the traffic in the different classes it would provide no more of a measure of the effective narrowing of the differential than does the simple range of the tariff . A satisfactory measure of the narrowing of the differential could be computed with respect to particular hauls if details were available of the traffic carried in each class for the relevant hauls in the two years . This information is not available , however , so the search for a precise statistical measure of the extent to which the differential in the tariff has been narrowed must be abandoned , though the fact of the narrowing is not of course in dispute . Despite this narrowing the principle of a differential tariff remains the basis 4 // of tariff policy , limiting the freedom of the Administration to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff is not the only limitation on the freedom of the Railways Administration to act competitively . There are , in addition , the common carrier obligations imposed on the Administration in the Act . No undue preferences must be granted , and no particular person may be subjected to any undue disadvantage ; no substantial alteration in charges can be made without consultation with a Transport Advisory Council ; charges must be published ; and everyone has a right to service at the published charges ) . There has been , however , an important relaxation in the effective restrictiveness of the control over railway charges from December 1958 . An amendment to the Act now allows the quotation of special , low rates without prior publication , although subsequent publication is required and the standard class rates set the maximum that can be charged . The amendment in effect means that immediate 1 See East African Railways and Harbours Act , sections 5 , 7 , 43 and 44 . The legal restrictions may not , however , be the only limitations on the freedom of action of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotations of special charges for goods traffic can be given in the face of road competition . ' 1 The Railways Administration stated that , nevertheless , they had no intention of embarking on wholesale rate reductions , and that for the great majority of goods carried , the standard rates are likely to remain the basis of actual charges . ' 2 The amendment to the Act increased the ability of the Railways Administration to compete with road transport , but it did not relieve them of the disabilities of a common carrier . These arise not only from an inability to lower charges for competitive traffics , nor simply from the obligation to accept all traffic . They arise from an inability to charge a particular traffic what it costs . It would be no burden to accept any particular traffic so long as the Administration were allowed to charge what it costs . This the amendment to the Act does not allow . The effect is asymmetrical , permitting a reduction of rates to meet com-petition , but not a raising of rates to meet the costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , for some reason or other , is unusually costly at no more than the standard class rate for the commodity . The legislation has allowed a move in the direction of a competitive tariff , but such a tariff is not based on cost . ( b ) ROAD HAULAGE CHARGES It is , naturally enough , impossible to deal with the charges made by road hauliers in the same way as the railway tariff was dealt with in the previous section . In road haulage there are considerable numbers of more or less competitive undertakings , each setting its own charges without overt control . It is not , as with the railway , a matter of a single organization operating to a published and publicly regulated tariff . There is a presumption t hat road haulage operates in a competitive atmosphere , and that there is sufficient competition to prevent much discriminatory pricing , so that charges are fairly closely related to cost.3 A certain amount of information on road haulage charges is to // be obtained from several sources , ' but little would be gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for some traffics , and particularly for those in the higher-rated classes of the railway tariff , road haulage is competitive with the railway . The extent of the competition is considered in the next section of this chapter . ( c ) ROAD-RAIL COMPETITION In East Africa the general problem created by the unsuitability in competitive conditions of the traditional form of railway tariff is further complicated by the use of the tariff to promote the development of the territories . Road transport attracts traffic in the high-rated classes of the railway tariff , and so deprives the Railways Administration of revenues that are needed if they are to continue to be able to charge low rates for other traffics . The existence of the differential tariff , so the argument runs , enables road hauliers to compete even though they have higher costs than the railway . This is the basis of the railway 's case for restrictions on road transport , that such restrictions are necessary to prevent a diversion of traffic from the lowest cost means of transport . There are very few statistics about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to measure in any precise way the growth of the industry and the extent to which the railway has lost traffic to road hauliers.2 The number of lorries licensed to operate in each of the countries of East Africa provides some indication of the size and growth of the industry , and the figures for a series of years are set out in Table II . Measurement of the traffic lost ' to road transport faces con-ceptual as well as statistical problems . In the first place , it can not be known what traffic would have gone to the railway if the road transport industry had not existed , for road transport may have created traffic as well as diverted it . Likewise , it is impossible to // Table determine with any precision what traffic has been diverted from rail to road solely by the operation of the railway differential tariff . Yet it is recognized that the only road traffic that can properly be considered as lost ' to the railway is that for which the railway provides the lowest cost transport and which travels by road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The Railways Administration acknowledge the fact that it is difficult to draw the line precisely between what must be accepted as rail and road transport 's legitimate spheres of service and to deduce therefrom the revenue loss on traffic which might reason-ably be expected as falling within the Railway 's preserve . 12 They have pointed out that there are many obvious reasons why road transport should tend to expand and in doing so encroach more and more on what was previously regarded as exclusively railway transport business : the condition of the roads is steadily improving and many new roads have been constructed ; road vehicle per-lormance has improved over the years , notably in the direction of cheap diesel propulsion ; and the type of undertaking and small capital required has a strong appeal to a certain section of the community.12 Traffic attracted to the roads for these reasons - night be considered as being in road transport 's legitimate // sphere of service ' , for it has not been diverted from the railway simply by the operation of the railway 's differential tariff . An estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the total loss of revenue to the railway arising from road competition amounted to some ? 600,000 . Table III sets out the amounts for each com-modity , but it is not clear that these estimates really reflect the traffic diverted to the roads purely by the high rates of the dif-ferential tariff . For example , it is pointed out that paint travels from the factory in Dar es Salaam to Nairobi by road because , although transport by sea and rail via Mombasa would be slightly cheaper , this advantage is offset by the delays and damage involved . Nevertheless , a loss of revenue from paint is included in the estimate . Similarly , the Railways Administration 's discussion of the reasons why sugar and cement go by road does not carry complete conviction that it is not because the roads provide transport at a lower cost . ' // A further estimate in 1958 , and the most recent that has been made , puts the tonnage diverted from rail to road at 287 thousand tons and the gross loss of railway revenue at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative assessment of the loss of traffic , and covered traffic which moved 8o miles or more on roads more or less parallel to the railway , ' 2 but again , it is not entirely clear that it was all traffic which could , in fact , be carried more cheaply by rail . ' 2 Even if the Administration 's estimate be accepted as indicating the volume of traffic carried by road which could have been carried at a lower economic cost by rail , the diversion does not appear to be very large when compared with the 3,900 thousand Ions of traffic , with a revenue of L I5 mn. , carried by the railway in 1958.3 However , estimates of the traffic actually carried by road t ransport do not indicate the potential magnitude of the problem created by the operation of the railway differential tariff . The growth of road traffic is restricted in Kenya and Tanganyika by t lie imposition of restrictive licensing , and although there is widespread evasion of the restrictions it is likely that they do nevertheless significantly limit the diversion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff at the beginning ( ) I ' 1960 improved the competitive position of the railway , and at the end of the year it was thought that it was now holding its ) wn against road competition ' .4 But the situation is not a static one , for as roads and vehicles improve road hauliers will become increasingly more competitive and will continue to attract more t raffic from the railway unless the restrictions are progressively t ightened or the railway tariff is modified to allow a competitive charging policy to be pursued . It may be concluded , therefore , that despite the comparatively xntall diversion of traffic that exists , there is a serious problem of transport policy to be faced . Is the railway tariff progressively to cease to be used as an instrument for the development of the territories ? Are restrictions on road transport to be progressively // increased ? 1 Or is there some third policy by which the dis-advantages of each of these two policies may be avoided ? It is the main conclusion of this study to suggest a third way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to costs was considered , and it was concluded that a distribution of traffic between road and rail in response to charges that reflect costs would minimize the social cost of transport . It was also concluded that it was by no means a straightforward matter to set prices which would achieve such a distribution of traffic , because of the complicated nature of transport costs , and because of the different circumstances in which road and rail transport operate . The competitive solution , if by that is merely meant allowing road and rail to compete freely and to determine their charges solely according to their competitive position , would not achieve a desirable result . Elements of the simple competitive solution have been intro-duced in East Africa ? the narrowing of the differential in the railway tariff , and the freedom to quote exceptional rates without prior publication , are examples ? and there is a view that further moves should be made in this direction . A complete adoption of the competitive solution is prevented , however , by the importance attached to the maintenance of the differential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ruled out by the competitive solution , under which charges would be determined solely by the pressures of competition . In fact , the differential tariff might , so to speak , be stood on its head , for many of the traffics which at present are subsidized so as to assist agricultural , mining , and industrial , development ' are those bulk , long haul traffics in which the railway possesses a comparative advantage over road haulage , and which , therefore , under a competitive tariff would be relatively highly rated . The desire to maintain the differential tariff has resulted in the imposition of restrictions on road transport being the dominant approach to the road-rail problem . The degree of restriction attempted has varied from time to time and from territory to territory . The next two chapters describe the road transport licensing arrangements in East Africa and assess the arguments for and against the maintenance and reinforcement of the restrictions . CHAPTER V ROAD TRANSPORT LICENSING IN EAST AFRICA Restrictive licensing of road haulage is in force in Kenya and Tanganyika . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Kenya restrictions on road transport , other than those inherent in the state of the roads , date from 1932 when the Carriage of Goods by Motor ( Prohibition ) Ordinance was introduced . The purpose of this legislation , which was in fact less drastic than its title might suggest , was to restrict competition with the railway by controlling the operation of vehicles on certain roads running parallel with the railway . In 1937 the whole paraphernalia of the A ' , B ' , and C ' licences of the 1933 U.K. Road and Rail Traffic Act was introduced into Kenya by the Transport Licensing Ordinance . A ' Licences , as in the United Kingdom , were to be given to specialist Public Carriers who operated only for hire or reward ' , B ' Licences were for hauliers who carried goods for their own business and were in addition allowed to carry for hire or reward , while C ' Licences were for Private Carriers who were concerned to transport only their own goods . In reality the system established by the 1937 Ordinance never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise that an arrangement devised for the United Kingdom did not fit easily the very different circumstances of Kenya . For one thing , no A ' licences were ever issued , all legal road haulage for hire or reward being provided by B ' licensees . The policy of the Licensing Authority not to insist that Public Carriers should be the main providers of road haulage was undoubtedly the right one , for it would have been entirely inappropriate to license only specialized road hauliers when the market for their services was very limited . So far as the effect on competition with the railway is concerned , // however , it is another aspect of the licensing system which is of prime importance . The 1958 Committee of Enquiry Appointed to Examine the Transport Licensing Ordinance ( Madan Committee ) found that the restrictive intentions of the licensing arrangements had been widely frustrated by the comparatively free issue of C ' licences . Power to grant C ' licences was delegated by the Transport Licensing Board to the District Commissioners , and district administrations , being more concerned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway , were often loth to refuse licences . In addition , the administrative burden imposed by the large number of applications made proper consideration of each application impossible . In the United Kingdom , C ' licences entitling the licensee to carry his own goods have been issued effectively without limit , and without restriction on the range of operation . The growth of C ' licensed road haulage has been the main cause of the loss of goods traffic by the railways . In Kenya it was not simply that C ' licence holders carried their own goods by road instead of sending them by rail , but that C ' licensed vehicles were used illegally to carry goods for hire or reward . In both Kenya and Tanganyika this practice has been widespread , and has proved impossible to prevent . Even with frequent police checks on vehicles , enforcement of the law was uncertain because of the difficulty of proving the ownership of the goods being carried . The Railways Administration argued , clearly with some justice , that there should be closer control of the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly effective . ' 1 The difficulties of enforcement were not simply technical . There were also political difficulties , for the Ordinance was looked upon as a device to keep Africans out of the transport industry . The reconsideration of the licensing arrangements in Kenya , for which the Madan Committee was appointed , was prompted by a particular problem regarding the carriage of petrol by road . However , the deliberations of the Committee ranged over the whole field of road transport licensing , and some of their proposals in a modified form were embodied in legislation at the beginning of 196o . The Madan Committee reported in two stages . An Interim E.A.R . &; H. , Comments on the Transport Licensing Ordinance ' , para 12. // Report ' was concerned with the problem of road-rail com-petition , and was the basis for the legislation of r g6o . The Final Report2 dealt also with other grounds for the licensing of road transport , and it modified the recommendations of the Interim Report for dealing with road-rail competition . The effect of the 196o legislation was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Transport Licensing Board . The Board were given more specific instructions than they had had in the past to pursue the policies they had attempted to pursue . It was decreed that : On an application for a licence for a goods vehicle ... the Licensing Authority shall have regard to the following principles ( a ) where an adequate railway service is provided between two points , whether or not the charges therefor exceed the cost of carriage by road , licences for the carriage of goods by road between those points shall normally only be granted for a distance of not more than 30 miles ... ' 3 Previously , the Transport Licensing Board had been directed when considering an application for a licence , to have regard primarily to the public interest ' , 4 and it had interpreted the public interest to require protection of the railway . The inclusion in the legislative instrument of the requirement to protect the railway was determined by the Committee 's belief that the // Government and not the Licensing Board should be faced with the responsibility of defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .1 That the public interest required the railway to be protected was determined by the Committee 's belief that the public interest required the maintenance of the railway 's differential tariff . The case for the differential tariff was not argued by the Committee , nor was any evidence produced to demonstrate its importance to the economy of Kenya . It was acknowledged that there had been changes in railway rates and that to this extent the form of the differential tariff and the degree of differential are subject to change , and present difficul-ties in defining exactly what requires protection . ' 2 Nevertheless , the Committee concluded that : The need to preserve the differential tariff obliges us to take the view that the proper sphere of road transport , where an adequate railway service is available , is in short hauls and distribution to and from terminals on the railway line . ' 3 There was some heart-searching in the Committee about the principle that every citizen should be free to do as he likes with his own transport ' , but they were faced with the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of restriction would compromise the general principle of protection for the railways . . . There is a conflict between the liberty and private interest of the individual on the one hand , and the interest of the com-munity on the other . In our opinion the interest of the community should prevail . ' 4 Therefore , restrictions on the number issued , and on the sphere of operation of their holders , should be applied to C ' licences as to others . The Committee envisaged a relaxation of the 30 mile limit where it was warranted by the nature of the goods or the nature of the service . For example , beer and soft drinks , they thought , might justifiably be carried by road for longer distances parallel // to the railway if a considerable part of the load was being dis-tributed at intermediate points , and in the 196o legislation , in fact , no limit was laid down for the carriage of these commodities . The Committee thought that the carriage of perishables such as vegetables should also be unrestricted , but that vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? should not be allowed freely to carry back commodities which were high-rated in the railway tariff . The legislation took a somewhat more liberal view and permitted such back-hauls for up to 4o miles . The use of road transport was also to be un-restricted where the journey by rail , though possible , was sub-stantially longer than that by road . The Madan Committee 's proposals on road-rail competition in their Final Report , modifying those of their Interim Report , were stimulated by their belief that a system which combines licensing to restrict competition with the railway with licensing for other purposes must always be in danger of being misinter-preted , and , indeed , of being misapplied in its administration . " The Committee therefore conclude that the licensing of goods vehicles to protect the differential tariff should be clearly distinguished from licensing for any other reasons , and we therefore recommend the introduction of a separate licence for this purpose alone . ' 2 The Committee had no doubt that the simplest and most effective way of achiev-ing control over road transport in competition with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be controlled routes ' and to make these routes subject to the requirement of licensing by all goods vehicles which require to pass over them . ' 3 To operate on a controlled route , under the Committee 's pro-posals , a vehicle would have to have a special licence ? known as an X ' licence ? which would specify the routes over which it was permitted to operate . The intention of the scheme was to allow short-distance operation parallel with the railway where , for example , such operation was necessary to obtain access to the // railway or where it was necessary as part of a journey across or diverging from the railway route , and to allow unrestricted local transport around large urban areas , but without allowing extended operations prejudicial to the differential tariff . " The proposals in the Final Report of the Madan Committee hark back to the controlled routes of the Carriage of Goods by Road ( Prohibition ) Ordinance , which operated between 1932 and 1937 . This system of controlled routes was examined by the Kenya Committee on Co-ordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system were found in the complexity of administration when there were complex road and rail networks , and in the possibility that it would be profitable to carry goods by road over widely circuitous routes to avoid the controlled routes running parallel with the railway . On examining these objections in the light of present day conditions ' the Madan Committee found that they are no longer valid ' , and they were satisfied that the pattern of the railway system , and the present tariff structure , would permit of such a system being both practicable and effec-tive. ' 2 The Committee do not , however , argue this view , they merely state it , and it might be thought that the increased complexity of both rail and road networks and the improved conditions of the roads would have increased the validity of the objections found to hold in 1936 . Certainly , the appearance of the map on which the proposed Controlled Routes are marked and the Committee 's explanation do not instil confidence in the administrative practicability of the scheme.3 // There were two fundamental reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first , which has already been mentioned , ) was their belief in the importance of the differential tariff and in the necessity for restrictive licensing of road transport to preserve the structure of the railway tariff . The second was their belief that the railway , which is financed by the public , can provide a public service over long hauls at the cheapest cost to the country . ' 2 The Madan Committee 's argument about the cost advantage of the railway rests heavily on quotation from the 1945 Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Road Motor Transportation in South Africa . The Committee repeat the fallacious association in that Report3 of the public interest with the public ownership of the railways , as if the public interest in minimizing the social cost of transport would no longer hold if the railways were privately owned ! The Madan Committee also follow the South African Commission in accepting an entirely inadequate analysis of the costs of road and rail transport . A great deal of evidence was taken by the Madan Committee on the matter of road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparative costs of road and rail trans-port were challenged , and the Committee invited further evi-dence . In their Final Report the Committee remark that : It is only necessary to state here that the further evidence adduced on this subject strongly suggests that the average // costs of road transport under present conditions are very much more than the average of cts. 20 per ton mile on which the railway operates . ( Since the publication of our Interim Report , we were told in evidence that the average cost of cts. 20 which applied at that time has been reduced to cts. 17.79 . ) ' I They therefore adhered to the conclusion of the Interim Report that : This evidence even at its lowest would seem to bear out the contention that , but for the existence of the policy of the differential tariff the railways , as a commercial organization , do not require protection ' , 2 and that over short hauls road transport provides conveniences and economies , but ... that over long hauls the Railways Administration provides the cheapest form of transport in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differential tariff requires protection . ' 3 It may be that the Committee would have supported measures to protect the railway even if they had not been satisfied that it provided the lowest cost transport.4 That would have depended on how strongly they felt about the maintenance of the differential tariff . In the event , any conflict of interest was avoided by their acceptance of the argument that the cheapest transport over long hauls was provided by the railway . Unfortunately the matter is not so simple as that , for there are two basic weaknesses in the Committee 's treatment of transport costs . In the first place , their whole discussion is carried on in terms of broad averages , in which almost no attention is paid to the fact that the relative costs of road and rail may differ widely for different goods over different hauls at different times . These differences are not adequately accounted for by the single dis-tinction between long and short hauls . Secondly , their whole // discussion is carried on in terms of the costs of the different transport agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other costs fall on the transport user , and that these costs may differ widely according to the transport agency used.1 Some account of this fact is taken , it is true , in the proposal to exempt the carriage of certain commodities , such as vegetables , beer , and soft drinks , from the 30 mile limit , and to impose the restriction only where the Railways Administration is able to offer an adequate service ' . 2 It could be contended , however , that only the user is in a position to say whether a service is adequate ' , and the distance separating the Committee from a proper under-standing of the nature of the costs which may fall on transport users is clearly indicated by their cavalier dismissal of the impor-tance of convenience , in their proposal to exempt from restriction the carriage of goods where speed of delivery is patently essential and not merely a matter of convenience . ' 3 The importance of these matters , which were so inadequately considered by the Madan Committee , is given detailed attention in a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not introduced in Tanganyika until 1956 . The Ordinance of that year provided for two kinds of licence , the Public Carrier 's Licence and the Private Carrier 's Licence , the latter allowing the licensee to carry only his own goods . In exercising its discretion on the issue of a licence the Transport Licensing Authority was directed to take account of the extent to which it is necessary in the public interest to prevent uneconomic competition with other systems of transport including transport by railway , steamer and air services ' and to have regard to the provision of adequate , suitable and efficient services , the elimination of unnecessary services and unremuncra-tive services and the coordination of all forms of passenger trans-port . ' Private Carrier 's licences were issued without limit and without 5 // restriction on the area of operation . The Transport Licensing Authority reported in 1959 that : Complaints concerning the illegal operation of Private Carrier 's Licences have been received from operators of all races from all over the Territority . . . In far too many cases the licensee operates as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Railway and with those holders of Public Carrier 's Licences who are trying to build up efficient transport services . These offences are difficult to detect and the conditions of the licence are easy to evade . " It has become increasingly clear to the Authority during the past three years that an amendment of the Ordinance is necessary to make it possible for restrictions to be imposed in a Private Carrier 's Licence which would limit the area to that in which the holder needs to operate . ' 2 In 196o a Committee were appointed to examine the Transport Licensing Ordinance with a view to ascertaining whether , and if so , the extent to which its operation serves to achieve the purpose of regulating and controlling road transport in the Territory in the best interests of the general public and the economy of the Territory ' . The Committee reported in 1961,3 and the Transport Licensing Ordinance was amended in 1962.4 The Advisory Committee took their stand on the two basic principles that road transport licensing was necessary to protect the differential tariff of the railway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public transport system throughout the territory . ' 5 The two principles correspond , of course , to the distinction between the subject matter of the Interim Report of the Madan Committee in Kenya , which was concerned with the protection of the differential tariff , and the other reasons ' for licensing with which their Final Report also dealt.6 The Tanganyika 1 Annual Report of the Transport Licensing Authority , 1959 , para . 21. 2 Op. cit. , para . 23. 3 Report of the Ad Hoc Transport Licensing Adaisny Committee , Government Paper No. 2-1961 . A minority report by two members of the Committee advocated the repeal of the Transport Licensing Ordinance. 4 Transport Licensing Ordinance ( Amendment ) Act , 1962 , No. 48 of 1962. 5 Advisory Committee Report , para . 3. . 3 Our primary concern is with the issue of road-rail competition , so that the other reasons ' for restrictive licensing are not of central interest . The different reasons can not , however , be entirely divorced , and the other reasons ' are briefly discussed below in Appendix II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Madan Committee in paying no explicit attention to the relative costs of road and rail . There is no word about costs in the Report , and it would appear that the Advisory Committee assumed that the advan-tages of the differential tariff were too self-evident to require argument or support . There is nevertheless some implicit recognition of the importance of costs in the Committee 's recommendations . Their general proposal is to restrict the operations of road-hauliers on roads parallel to the Railway to 6o miles . ' 1 It may be deduced that the Committee believed the cost advantage of road haulage for distances up to 6o miles to be great enough to make it unwise to force traffic travelling these distances on to the railway . Excep-tions to the 6o mile limit are recommended for traffic in perish-ables and in beer and soft drinks and , at the discretion of the Transport Licensing Authority , for farmers , mining concerns or local manufacturers carrying their own goods which railway can-not suitably carry . ' 1 Again it may be deduced that the Com-mittee thought the cost advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside . In addition to these recommendations for limiting road com-petition with the railway , the Committee drew up an elaborate scheme for regulating road transport so as to protect regular long distance hauliers while at the same time encouraging develop-ment , free enterprise , and the entry of Africans into the road transport business.2 The basis of the scheme was a classification of all roads as either National Main Routes ' or as Local Routes ' . Control was to be strict on the National Main Routes , with road haulage being effectively restricted to specialized carriers , while it was to be much less strict on the Local Routes . The problem of illegal operation for hire and reward of vehicles licensed as Private Carriers was to be overcome , not by attempting to enforce the restriction to carriage of the licensee 's own goods , but by limiting the routes over which the vehicles could operate . The existing Private Carrier 's Licence was to be replaced by a new Limited Carrier 's Licence which would allow the licensee to carry his own goods and to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow ( apart from certain exceptional and minor cases ) the vehicle to be operated on National Main Routes . Limited Carriers ' Licences were to be issued by District Transport Licensing Boards for operation only on Local Routes , and it appears to have been envisaged that in general , though not without exception , the licence would restrict the licensee to operation within one particular district . ' The Tanganyika Government did not accept the full programme for the control of road transport drawn up by the Advisory Committee , and the Government 's scheme , as set out in a Government Paper2 and in amending legislation , 3 appears in some ways to be more , and in other ways less restrictive than the recommendations of the Committee , and certainly to involve less change in existing arrangements . Private Carriers are still restricted to carrying their own goods.4 On the other hand , no specific provision is made for limiting the distance parallel with the railway over which road hauliers may operate . The main innovation in the amending legislation is that , with some exceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . The areas are Dar cs Salaam and its environs , Tanga and its environs , and the remainder of Tanganyika . This arrangement is a subtle and administratively simple way of limiting competition with the railway and , incidentally , with regular long-distance road hauliers . The structure of the Tanganyika economy is such that commodities in the high-rated classes of the railway tariff are mainly imported , entering the country at Dar es Salaam or Tanga , and those which are not are produced in Dar es Salaam . If Private Carriers , whether or not they operate illegally carrying goods for hire or reward , are prevented from operating at all between the area around the ports and the rest of the country , they are effectively prevented from competing with the railway over long hauls . The recommendations of the Tanganyika Advisory Committee and the policy adopted by the Tanganyika Government both appear to be more sophisticated and less restrictive ways of i See Advisory Committee Report , para . 15 ( b ) and ( f ) . 2 No. 2-1961 , p. i. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1962. 4 Public Carriers , however , are allowed to carry their own goods as well as to operate for hire or reward . // treating the problem than are to be found in the Reports of the Kenya Madan Committee . To some extent this is true . The Advisory Committee 's proposal to control competition by private ( or Limited ) carriers simply by restricting the area of their operation would seem to be a more satisfactory approach than the Madan proposal strictly to limit the issue of licences and to attempt to enforce the prohibition on carrying goods for hire or reward . And the Tanganyika Government 's policy of confining private carriers to one of three areas appears both less restrictive and more enforceable than the proposals contained in either of the Reports of the Madan Committee . To some degree , however , the apparent merits of the Tanganyikan approaches to the problem are illusory . The illusion is in part created by the entire absence of discussion in the Advisory Committee 's Report . The Committee make no attempt to justify their principles , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baldly stated . In contrast , the Madan Committee , so to speak , give themselves away . They devote enough space to justifying the policies they propose for the flaws in their argument to become apparent . It is also relevant that the problem is far more complicated in Kenya than in Tanganyika because the network of road and rail communications is far more complicated . When this fact is taken into account there is not , perhaps , so much difference to be seen between the Controlled Routes of the Madan Committee and the three Areas for Private Carriers ' licences of the Tanga-nyika Ordinance . The primary weakness of all these proposals is that they are based on an inadequate analysis of the relative costs of road and rail transport . There is a further weakness that they are all more or less difficult to enforce . These matters are con-sidered in detail in the next chapter . ( ( ) UGANDA ' It has already been remarked that there is no restrictive licensing of road haulage in Uganda , although the necessity for it has frequently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on road haulage have been resisted on the grounds that enforcement would be impossible and that the // problem of road-rail competition is relatively unimportant in Uganda . The reason why the problem is so much less important than in , say , Kenya , it is argued , is because for Uganda the railway is mainly a link with the sea , and is relatively little used for internal transport . As it is this long-haul traffic , for which the railway has a comparative advantage , which is the main business of the railway in Uganda , road transport is complementary to the railway rather than competitive with it . The situation may be contrasted with that in Kenya , where the railway is important in internal traffic for which road haulage is highly competitive . The Railways Administration , however , reject the view that the traffic lost as a result of road operations in Uganda and across the border is not of significance in the railway economy . " The Uganda Government Memorandum on Mr. Hawkins ' Report , 2 while accepting the need to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Government does not believe that a comprehensive system of road freight licensing could be effectively introduced and operated in Uganda at the present time . ' 3 The Government did hold out the prospect of something being done , should it be shown that the development of road transport in direct competition with the Railway is so seriously affecting the financial health of the latter that the public interest in the widest sense is involved . ' The railway might be helped either by administrative action , restricting the use of specified routes to certain classes of traffic , or else ( probably more effectively ) by reducing the obligations4 of the Railway in relation to short-haul traffic . ' 3 The alternative offered , of course , is simply that between restrictionism ? and it is difficult to see that administrative action ' , unless it took the form of total prohibition , would not lead to all the complications of a licensing system ? and the competitive solution ' .

' 1 CHAPTER VI THE CASE FOR RESTRICTIONS ON ROAD TRANSPORT Many of the arguments of the protagonists both of restrictive licensing and of freedom for road transporters must appear unconvincing to an independent observer . The reports of the Madan Committee and of the Tanganyika Advisory Committee have already been critically surveyed . The present chapter examines in more detail some of the arguments on the question . ' The argument for the differential tariff is the argument for subsidizing some traffics and for taxing others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the matter , but it is a way that has some advantages . In principle , the decision to charge some traffics at low ' rates in no way necessitates the charging of high ' rates to other traffics ( except , of course , in the trivial sense that other rates will be higher than the low ' rates ) . The charging of high ' rates on some traffics to balance the low ' rates charged on others involves the implicit assumption that , although some users of railway services should pay low ' rates , users as a whole should pay at least the total cost of the services . The fallacy of the argument that the important thing is for users as a whole ' to cover the costs of a service is a commonplace of public utility economics.2 It is usually exposed in objections to the postalization ' 3 of public utility charges , or the charging of average ' costs irrespective of the actual costs imposed by particular users . The failure to differentiate in electricity charging between peak and off-peak users is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the railway tariff we are concerned with a somewhat different situation . Postalized ' charges are the same although costs differ ; the charges of the Further arguments of the supporters of roads and of railways are examined in Appendix I on The Development of the Transport System in East Africa ' . 2 See , for example , W. A. Lewis , Overhead Costs , pp. 29-31. 3 The flat-rate charge for letters irrespective of distance is , curiously , not an example of postalization ' in the sense of a fixed charge irrespective of differences in cost , because distance is not a very important variable in postal costs . // railway tariff are different for different traffics , but the differences in the tariff are not designed to reflect the differences in cost . What has to be justified if the differential tariff is to be de-fended is not one , but two divergences of charges from costs . The taxes must be justified as much as the subsidies . If the decision to subsidize some traffics is assumed to imply the raising of rates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those traffics is allowed to go by default . To express the decision to operate the differential tariff as a decision to subsidize some traffics and a decision to tax others emphasizes the fact that there are two separate decisions to be justified . It is convenient to leave the arguments for subsidizing some traffics until later . For the moment it will be assumed that the present low rates are maintained , and the question then is whether these low rates should be balanced by high rates on other traffics , and whether these high rates should be supported by restrictions on competition from road transport . No one , it may fairly be assumed , wants high rates on some railway traffics for their own sake . The high rates are supported solely because it is believed that the railways must pay their way ' . But if there is no logical justification for the view that low rates on some goods must be balanced by high rates on others it follows that the high rates should be abolished and the low rates sustained by subventions to the railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the economic logic ; but it is not a policy that has much chance in present circumstances of being put into practice . The finances of the East African Govern-ments are such that it is inconceivable that a proposal to sub-sidize the railway from general public funds would meet with approval . ' There are in fact two arguments against subsidizing the low rated traffic from general public revenue instead of from other railway traffic . ' One is the argument which has just been men-tioned , that the Governments could not afford to do so . It would be wrong , of course , to assess their ability to do so in terms of the magnitude of railway finances as a whole in relation to those of the Governments . On this basis such a proposal would indeed appear to be unreasonable . The recurrent revenues of the Governments 6o THE CASE FOR RESTRICTIONS totalled some ? 75 mn. compared with an E.A.R . and H. railway revenue of almost J2o mn. in 1960.1 But the total finances of the railway have nothing to do with the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in a later chapter of the magnitude and distribution of the subsidies and taxes , and they are found to amount in total to some &I; mn . The subsidies , therefore , are in fact substantial in relation to government reven-ues , and there can be no doubt that a proposal for an additional burden of this size on the public finances would not be acceptable . Whether or not with the support of economic logic , it seems that the railways will have to pay their way.2 The second argument for not giving external subsidies to the railway is that such a measure would detract from the business-like operation of the enterprise . Further , there would be no objective test of the size of the subsidy required , and the govern-ments would have to accept the evidence of the railways ' own costings . There is clearly something in these objections , but their validity can be exaggerated . The protection against competition that must be given to the railways if they are to pursue a policy of internal subsidization would also enable their management to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , with respect to branch lines , the receipt of external subsidies , though of course on a smaller scale than would be required in the circumstances envisaged in the present discussion . The major argument against external subsidies remains , then , the inability of the Governments to meet such an additional claim on their finances.3 If taxes in the form of high rates for some traffics are to be imposed effectively then measures must be taken against both tax avoidance and tax evasion . If the tax is avoided on a large enough scale the yield will not suffice for the subsidies . Transport users could avoid the tax by using road transport . If the charges of road transporters are less than the railway charges on the taxed , high-rated traffics transport users will have an incentive to avoid // the tax by using road transport . In a sense , they may be unable to avoid the whole of the tax . If the costs of rail transport , and therefore the charges that would be made if the taxes were not levied , are lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted to the roads will pay more than they would pay if the taxes were not levied on railway traffic . But so long as road charges are below those of the railway , and assuming for the moment that there are no other considerations that affect the users ' choice between one mode of transport and the other , the tax will be ineffective in raising revenue to support the subsidized rates . When they are looked at from this point of view , measures to restrict the freedom of operation of road transport appear as measures to restrict the scope for tax avoidance . The effectiveness of the measures to restrict tax avoidance depends on the ease with which tax avoidance can be continued as tax evasion . One of the difficulties , as the evidence on the working of transport licensing in Kenya and Tanganyika shows , is that a substantial measure of tax evasion takes place , as in the illegal operation of C ' licensed vehicles . Although the argument for road transport restrictions has not usually been expressed in these terms , it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax avoidance . ' This is what in effect the Madan Committee mean when they refer to the need for the protection of the differential tariff ' , 2 and when they say that but for the existence of the policy of the differential tariff the railways , as a commercial organization , do not require protection ' .3 The point was expressed concisely by a Minister of the Kenya Government who is reported to have confirmed the view that the issue of protection was not protection of the railways , but protection of the differential tariff , which was the only possible justification for road transport licensing ' .4 The Railways Administration themselves are not unnaturally // also insistent that they are asking not for protection of the railway but for protection of the differential tariff . It is inevitable ' , they point out , that the person who does not know the intricacies and critical balancing of rating in the railway differential rating system should think that the E.A.R . &; H. merely aims at the retention of easy monopolistic privilege in opposing certain forms of road transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifle a young and vigorous competitor who is offering transport at a lower cost . This ' , they protest , is not so ' .1 The relative costs of road and rail transport are such , the Adminis-tration claim , that the railways , if left to deal with road competi-tion , would have no great difficulty in offering lower rates than any road transport operator . In so far as protection has been required in recent years and is still required , it is to safeguard the present tariff which is of a form which , until now , has proved acceptable to the majority of producing and commercial interests in East Africa . Indeed , primary producers have regarded a differential tariff as vital for their interests ' .2 There are , however , occasions when the distinction between protection of the differential tariff and protection of the railway as such becomes somewhat blurred . This is the case with argu-ments based on a reference to the public funds that are tied up in the capital of the railway . For example the argument is found in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking the railways should never lose sight of the ? 150,000,000 of public money sunk in the administration 's installations , locomotives and rolling stock . ' 3 This is a straight appeal for the protection of the capital value of the railway . There is no hint of a // distinction between that and the need to protect the differential tariff from erosion through the growth of competing road trans-port . The argument that , in the public interest , the capital value of the railway must be protected is fallacious . From the point of view of the railway as a business organization it would no doubt be desirable to obtain protection against competition . Any business organization , from its own narrow point of view , can hardly fail to welcome a restriction on the activities of its competitors , though this is not , of course , to say that the Railways Administration take so narrow a view of affairs . From the point of view of the public interest , however , there is no case for protecting artificially the value of existing investments . Bygones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ( has been ) sunk in the administration 's installations , locomotives and rolling stock ' in the past has no bearing on the public interest at the present time . In the social interest the rule is that goods should be carried by the method that makes the smallest use of economic resources . If , as a result of the investment carried out in the past , the railway can provide transport services with a smaller use of resources than if the capital assets created in the past did not exist , then that is all to the good . Society is benefiting by the free gift from the past that the capital assets represent . But it would be obtuse to enforce , by restrictions on alternative providers of transport services , the utilization of assets inherited from the past if to utilize them required the current use of more resources than if they were not utilized . A free gift can be a white elephant . It is perhaps in the minds of those who argue for protection of the railway capital that , by keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road transport , the invested resources can be recovered ' , or their commitment to the particular use justified , because the railway revenue will be enough to service the capital . Such a policy will protect the finances of the railway but it will impose a loss on the economy as a whole . The expendi-tures on investment carried out in the past are now embodied in specific assets track , locomotives , rolling stock , etc. which can be used only for the provision of rail transport services ) . They exist , whether they are used or not . In consequence , there is no opportunity cost of using them in the short period , although 64 . THE CASE FOR RESTRICTIONS there is an opportunity cost of using them in the long-run.l The short-run resource use of the railway , therefore , is less than the long-run resource use , and if it is less than the resource use of road trans-port , it is in the social interest that the railway shall continue to operate while the existing capital assets are still usable . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made available in the long period , whether or not , that is , they should be replaced when they wear out , is another matter . It depends on the demand for their services . This in turn will depend on the alternative transport services available . If the long-run resource use of road transport is smaller than the long-run resource use of the railway , then the assets of the railway will not need to be replaced because , in the long run , transport will be more econo-mically provided by road . Restrictions on road transport which prevent the diversion of traffic from rail to road will impose a loss on society . They will create a financial situation in which it appears that the railways are needed in the long-run . The fixed assets of the railway will therefore be replaced when they wear out , and transport services will be provided with a greater use of resources than is necessary . The criterion for the social interest , that goods should be carried by the method that incurs the smallest use of economic resources , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding , that the preceding discussion must not be taken to imply the view that , in the long run , East African Railways should cease to exist . It will become apparent that this is certainly not the conclusion of this study . The discussion was merely in-tended to show that current policy should not be influenced by the fact that public money has been spent on the railway system in the past . Bygones are bygones , and policy in the public interest should be concerned to ensure that transport services are provided with the minimum possible current use of economic resources . It will , however , be objected that the financial charges for which the Railways Administration are responsible can not be ignored . The capital for the railways has been raised by borrowing , and however true it may be that bygones are bygones there exists the obligation to service the loans . It is , of course , not intended to deny that debts have to be paid . The financial obligations can not be avoided ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // economic use of resources . The simple answer to the objection , in principle , is this . If road transport uses less resources than the railway , it would be in the social interest to raise revenue to service the railway loans by a tax on road transport rather than by restricting the use of road transport so as to make the railway pay ' . ' There is another argument for restricting road transport which must also be rejected as fallacious . This is the argument that because the average costs of the railway are below the average costs of road hauliers , it is in the social interest to restrict road transport so that transport is provided by the least costly method . The contention that the railway services on average are cheaper than the average costs of road transport ' has not gone uncontested . Figures were submitted to the Madan Committee in support of the argument that road transport was cheaper than the railway . The figures suggested that the cost of road transport between Mombasa and Nairobi could be as low as 8.4. c.p.t.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full load in both directions , and it was rightly criticized as being entirely irrelevant to operating conditions.2 The Railways Administration main-tained that their costs would be as low as 7.7 c.p.t.m. with full loads in both directions . This reply is not , in fact , completely convincing , because the difference between the capacities of road // and rail transport units makes it intrinsically more likely that full loads will be obtained by road than by rail ; but it must of course be agreed that a comparison of road costs under ideal ' conditions , with rail costs under actual operating conditions is valueless . ' Evidence by other transporters put road costs under operating conditions at about 40 c.p.t.m . Although too precise comparisons must not be made between figures the detailed method of estima-tion of which is not known , it does appear that the average costs of operation of the railway , at something under 20 c.p.t.m. , are below the costs of road transport2 when the comparison is made on a proper basis . The point at issue , however , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In evidence to the Madan Committee the Railways Administra-tion maintained that the question at issue is surely whether or not the railway services on average are cheaper than the average costs of road transport , and not the costs of any particular movement by road ' .3 It is true , of course , as we have seen , that no valid con-clusion can be drawn from a comparison of the average cost of rail transport with the costs of any particular movement by road . ' That is not a comparison of like with like . But it is equally impossible to draw any valid conclusion by comparing the overall average cost of road and rail . In dealing with transport costs a certain amount of averaging is inevitable.4 But there is a limit beyond which averaging can not be allowed to go . This limit is well exceeded in the use of such broad aggregates as the cost of the railway services on average ' and the average costs of road transport ' . If such a comparison is accepted as valid , and if it is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it follows that there is no place for the existence of both road and // rail transport . If the railway services on average arc cheaper than the average costs of road transport ' there should , in the social interest , be no transport by road where railway facilities exist . This contention is , in fact , the burden of the Railways Adminis-tration 's submissions on transport licensing.l In a submission to the Tanganyika licensing authority , it is contended that along the routes to which objection is made the railway provides adequate services and road transport is unnecessary ' .2 On this argument it is only the differential tariff that allows road transport to survive , let alone to flourish . It may indeed be true that , if the railway charge per ton-mile were set at a figure equal to the railway average total cost per ton-mile , and if this charge were made for all commodities over all distances , then road transport could not compete . But it is by no means certain that road transport could obtain no business if the railway services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing policy did attract all traffic to the railway , it by no means follows that this would be in the social interest . The validity of these two statements arises from facts that are ignored in comparisons of the average costs of road and rail transporters . One fact is that the cost of transport is not the same per ton-mile for all commodities over all distances.3 Because of these variations in cost a tariff under which the same charge , equal to the average per ton-mile cost , is made for all traffics will not be satisfactory , for some traffics will be charged less than the value of the resources they utilize . A second fact is that the relationship between rail costs and road costs is different for the different commodities and distances , so that road transport may cost more than rail for some traffics and less for others.4 If in these circum-stances a railway charge equal to average rail costs did attract all traffics to the railway , such a charge would not be in the social interest , because some traffic would be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost by road . ' Thirdly , it is a relevant fact that the cheapest form of transport can not be assessed in relation to the costs incurred by the transport operators alone . Any policy which fails to take these facts into account can not lead to the most economical use of resources in the provision of trans-port . And the contention that traffic should in the public interest go by rail because the average cost of rail transport is less than that of road transport flies in the face of these facts . This third reason why comparisons of average cost are irrele-vant warrants further elaboration , because a good deal has been made of it in studies of transport economics . The first two reasons rest essentially on the ground that there is a dispersion of costs around the average , so that the fact that rail average costs are lower than road average costs does not mean that all rail costs are lower than all road costs . The third reason is one for dismissing as irrelevant not only the fact that average rail costs are lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any particular haul the cost of rail is lower than the cost of road . The reason , which has already been summarily stated in Chapter III , is that there are costs to the user of transport additional to the charge he pays the haulier , and these costs are likely to differ according to the method of transport used . The cheapest method is that for which all costs , not only those incurred by the haulier , are the least . A lower level of haulier 's costs may well be outweighed by a higher level of other costs imposed on the user . Some examples of the point in question are obvious . The railway charge may be lower than the road transport charge , but if the one is a station-to-station service and the other a door-to-door service , the additional costs the user has to incur when using the railway may make road transport the cheaper service . The road service may be more expensive but quicker than the railway , and to the extent that time is money ' it will be cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by road transport , a lower railway charge may not be enough to offset the additional costs imposed on the user . If a firm uses its own road vehicles to deliver its goods and at the same time the driver takes orders , the // whole process may be cheaper for the firm than would the use of railway transport , even though a costing of the actual road delivery would show it to be more expensive than the delivery charge by railway . And there are likely to be other more subtle ways in which the cost to the user is greater for the nominally less expensive method of transport . What this argument amounts to is that the quality of service ' . as well as the charge by the haulier determines what form of trans-port is cheapest for the user . It will not do to dismiss the matter as one of mere convenience ' 2 because inconvenience is a cost , just as much as the money cost which has to be paid to the haulier for his services . For after all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , a shop-keeper in Kampala of having the goods he wants to sell in a godown at Mombasa . The fact that there are other considerations than the costs incurred by the hauliers is implicitly recognized in the Kenya transport licensing arrangements . Exceptions to the general rule limiting road transport parallel with the railway to distances of less than 30 miles were made for perishables , and for beer and soft drinks.3 But the granting of specific exceptions to restrictive licensing , it can be argued , is a blunt device for selecting not only the traffics which can be carried at a lower haulier cost by road than by rail , but also those for which so subtle an influence as quality of service outweighs the advantage of a lower rail charge . To achieve the proper distribution of traffic between road and rail , the licensing system would have to allow road transport to deal with traffic which , in the absence of licensing , would go by road even if the railway operated a cost-based tariff ; it would have to // prohibit the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the absence of licensing , only because of the existence of the high rates of the differential tariff , and which would go by rail if the railway tariff were cost-based . Because of the difficulty of assessing and taking account of all cost elements , it is inevitable that a licensing system will fail to take account of some of them and will prevent some traffic from being carried by the lowest cost agency . In principle the licensing system could be insufficiently restrictive , so that road transport was permitted to carry some high rated traffic for which the social cost was lower by rail.i On the whole , however , it seems likely that the licensing system will err on the other side ; road transport will tend to be restricted more than is necessary to achieve the social optimum . The way the matter will be approached in practice will tend to this result . The approach will be : transport by road parallel with the railway is not allowed except in circumstances where it can be shown that the social cost by road is lower.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which such a licensing policy could be applied . Each application could be argued on its merits , the regulatory authority being given no more specific directions than to allow road transport where its social cost was below that of rail transport . This arrangement could hardly be practicable for the proceedings would be lengthy and complicated if the authority were given no more precise directions on how to assess the social cost of road and rail . Alternatively , a set of fairly precise rules could be drawn up to tell the authority when licences should be granted . This is what the Kenya Ordinance does . It specifies the circum-stances ? ' when the available railway service represents only a small part of the total journey ' , for example ? under which // exceptions to the rule of no road transport where there is a railway should be allowed . The trouble with this procedure is that it is difficult if not impossible to specify in the form of general rules all the circumstances in which the social cost of road transport will be less than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ignored in the rules . It will be difficult , for example , to take account of the fact that the social cost of each form of transport will vary from time to time according to conditions of demand . It may be that in most circumstances the social cost of the transport of machinery to a mine or factory is lowest by rail ; but if at some time the whole operation of the plant is held up for the want of a spare part , the social cost imposed by a special road journey to obtain the spare part may be very much less than the social cost of obtaining the spare by rail involving considerable delay . If licences were not normally granted for the carriage by road of machinery it would be necessary to allow the granting of special emergency licences to meet such eventualities as this . The example admittedly is an extreme one , but it is instructive . The Kenya Ordinance lays down that licences shall not normally be granted where an adequate railway service is provided between two points ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described is that the meaning of an adequate railway service ' varies according to the economic circumstances of the moment , and that no fixed meaning , based on technical considerations , can be given to it . It is not easy to specify the application of a principle the meaning of which is subject to such changes . In the case just considered the urgency of the matter could quite clearly be argued , and it is reasonable to expect that provisions for the issue of a special emergency licence would meet the need . But not all examples of where the social cost is variable with circumstances , and therefore difficult to express in a set of rules , can be handled so easily . Imagine the circumstances in which road transporters are fully engaged during the harvest season in delivering the crop to railhead , but that at other times of the year they have little business . The social cost of road transport will be low at such times of excess capacity , and it may well be lower than that of rail transport , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social cost there may be , therefore , an argument for allowing road traffic parallel with the railway during times of // excess capacity in road transport . ' But it is difficult to think that a licensing system would in practice be sufficiently flexible for no undue restrictions to be imposed on road transport in such circumstances . A somewhat related difficulty arises over restrictions on back hauls ' . Where a journey has been made the social cost of carrying goods on the return journey is extremely low . It would appear to violate the social optimum in transport if road transporters , who have been allowed to make journeys parallel to the railway under one of the exceptions to the general prohibition , are forbidden to carry high-rated traffic on the return journey . But the difficulty , if there are no restrictions on back hauls , is that the outward journey will be made for the sole purpose of obtaining back haul traffic . The nominally forward haul would be undertaken in order to obtain the profitable return haul traffic . In fact the true direction ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the supposed back haul will have become the forward haul , and the high-rated goods may be carried by road at higher social cost than they could have been carried by rail . In principle it can be argued that nominal return haul traffic should be allowed if the charge by road is below the cost by rail . But it is doubtful if this provides a practicable basis for a licensing decision , and the road charges would be difficult to police.2 Although it is not clear , in this instance , which way the bias of restriction will lie , it is difficult to believe that a licensing system will lead to the right ' answer to this complicated question . And it must be remembered that the greater the number of special cases , the greater will be the administrative burden of the licensing arrangement . In general , it may be surmised that because of the difficulty of allowing for the less obviously desirable exceptions to the restrictions on road transport , a licensing system will in practice tend to be too restrictive . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social cost at times of full and excess capacity must not , however , be exaggerated . It will be the more important the larger the capital cost in total cost . But in road transport the capital cost is not a particularly large part of total cost . And it may , of course , be that there is also excess rail capacity at such a time , and the social cost of rail may in fact be lower than that of road . The example is merely intended to illustrate the variations to which social cost is subject . 2 The road hauliers would , of course , given the high rates of the railway tariff , stand to gain heavily if they were able to charge more in practice than the charges on the basis of which they were licensed . // economic resources because goods will not always be carried by the method with lowest social cost . It has , indeed , been the common argument of economists concerned with the problem that a selection of the least-cost form of transport can not be achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to ensure that a transport service is always provided by the method that uses the least economic resources , it is argued that in most cases this will not be suffi-ciently ensured by having a central transport co-ordinating organization decide which of the available methods shall be used , since no such organization can know or take account of the relative inconvenience of each available method to the individual user , or of the relative degree to which each method involves him in costs additional to the transport charge he actually pays . " On this view , only the user can judge which method of transport will satisfy his requirements at the smallest total cost , taking account not only of the costs of actual carriage , but also of other costs ( or inconveniences ) incidental to it ' .2 This argument for free choice to the user is based upon the fact that only the user is in possession of all the information about the total costs involved in using different methods of transport . ' 3 The argument , in principle , is entirely valid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , it must be remembered that , in practice , an ideal allocation of resources will not be achieved whatever the system for allocation . It is mis-leading to contrast the unsatisfactory achievement of a licensing system with an ideal allocation by the price mechanism for , in practice , the price mechanism will not itself achieve an entirely satisfactory allocation . The high rates of the railway tariff , it will he recalled , are a form of tax , and the licensing system is a mecha-nism of tax enforcement . The tax , by altering the relationship between price and cost , tends to shift demand and to cause economic waste . Without a licensing system too much traffic would go by road . Restrictive licensing is designed to prevent the shift and is likely , it has been argued , to over-compensate . Traffic is forced ' on to the railway which would better go by road . // But the waste may not be very great . It is obscurantist to condemn a regulatory system by reference to the ideal ' results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wastes under the regulatory system . The argument against restriction will be convincing only if it can be shown to involve clear and substantial losses . It is also easy to be obscurantist about the quality of service provided by transport agencies . Reference to some indefinable qualities of which the transport user alone can be aware is not an entirely convincing reason for dismissing as irrelevant a comparison of the costs actually incurred by the different agencies . There is , it is true , no way in principle in which it is possible to controvert an assertion that there are quality differences of great importance which are knowable only to the user , and which can be taken into account only by allowing the user free choice between the different agencies . But the practical man is entitled to be sceptical about the importance of quality differences that can not be explained in clear , objective terms : in terms of break-ages , door-to-door delivery , time of transit , etc . And differences in quality that do arise from such objective considerations can be taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some-thing the existence of which can be understood only by observing what transport users do when given an unrestricted choice between different transport agencies , and one may doubt the importance of differences the existence of which can only be understood in this way . Of course , the precise weight which users put on quality differences , even when they arise from what we have called objective considerations , can not be assessed by a licensing authority . But if the large and obvious differences are allowed // for in licensing policy , the remainder are likely to be of the second order of importance . A restrictive licensing system is , it may be agreed , a blunt device for selecting those traffics where a difference in the quality of service outweighs a difference in haulage costs , so that total costs are lower for the agency whose haulage cost is higher . In consequence , some traffics may be forced to use the agency for which the total cost is not the lowest . But the losses imposed by such restrictions are not likely to be too great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerable skill . The argu-ment against restrictive licensing on the ground that has just been considered , while persuasive , is therefore by no means conclusive . It is conclusive that restrictions on road transport can not be justified on the ground that the average cost of rail transport is lower than that of road transport . But it would not necessarily be wrong to restrict the operation of road transport in traffics where the costs incurred by the railway can be shown to be lower than those incurred by road transport , so long as allowance is made for substantial differences in the quality of service pro-vided by the two transport agencies . In other words , it can not be accepted that a free choice between the agencies is essential if a gross waste of resources is to be avoided . So long as the licensing authority is not intent on excessive restriction and is aware that the social cost of road transport can for some traffics be lower than the social cost of rail transport , restrictive licensing may not lead to any great waste of resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole be carried by the method of least social cost.l If the only relevant considerations were those examined so far , and if the railway were to be prevented from applying a cost tariff because of the importance attributed to the maintenance of the differential tariff , restrictive licensing of road transport might be acceptable as a method of transport co-ordination ' . The differential tariff could be sustained at relatively small social cost . But there are , in fact , other considerations which constitute powerful arguments against a general restriction of road transport in East Africa in the interests of the differential railway tariff . There are costs of a licensing system in addition to those // incurred through the excessive diversion of traffic from road to rail . One of these costs arises from the fact that restrictions on the operations of road hauliers are liable to hinder the development of the road transport industry . This fact is so obvious as to be almost a tautology , but it is not certain that the costs of such restricted growth are sufficiently appreciated . There often appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a service industry ' can be as important an ingredient of economic growth as development in the production of goods . The greater production of some commodities that might be achieved by the subsidization of the differential tariff is not a net gain , for against it must be set the smaller development than might otherwise have taken place in road transport . Experience in countries where road transport licensing does not exist suggests that road trans-port is a fertile field for the development of African entrepre-neurs . ) It is not enough to refer to the scope for development of road transport in directions not parallel ' to the railway . There is not so clear a distinction as that between traffic which is and traffic which is not competitive with the railway . For example , it has been argued above that the use of excess capacity , whether seasonal or as back hauls , parallel with the railway may some-times be desirable and is likely to be prevented by a licensing system . The use of such excess capacity may be important for the success of African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake such business may have a serious retarding effect on the growth of the industry . The argument of the previous paragraph rests on the as-sumption that it is only desirable to allow road transporters to operate where the social cost of road transport is below that of rail . The argument against restriction rests on the ground that the licensing system will prohibit road transport in some cases where this is so , and that although the losses imposed on the economy by the waste of resources may not be large , the restrictions may nevertheless have an important effect on the growth of the road transport industry . But there may well be a case for encouraging African-run road transport even where the current social cost of road is greater than of rail . The importance of the development of entrepreneurial abilities in East Africa is very great , and it may // well be that the external economies generated by the artificial ' encouragement of the growth of an entrepreneurial group would make it worth accepting an uneconomic ' diversion of resources . If road transport is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of entrepreneurial abilities , there is a strong case for encouraging the growth of the industry , even at the expense of a wasteful diversion of traffic away from the railway.l Even more , therefore , does a policy stand condemned which retards the growth of the industry by a wasteful diversion of traffic to the railway . It is also necessary to bring into the account the more obvious costs of operating the licensing system . The expenses of the licensing authority itself , and the burden imposed on road trans-port operators in applying for licences and on road transporters and the Railways Administration in appeals against licensing decisions , should not be entirely ignored even though they may not be large in total . There is also the cost of policing the restric-tions . It can be argued that this may be neglected because police checks on road transport are necessary to enforce safety regulations and would continue to be carried out even if there were no restrictions on road transport to protect the railway tariff . Within its limits this argument has weight , although it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the policing of the economic ' restrictions . However , the relevance of the argu-ment is strictly limited because it relates to the existing degree of enforcement . In the whole discussion so far no distinction has been made between a decision of the licensing authority and the practical application of that decision . It has been implicitly assumed that decisions of the authority are entirely effective in practice . In fact , however , both in Kenya and Tanganyika there has been a serious discrepancy between the intentions of the licensing autho-rity and the achievement . Licensing restrictions and exemptions can perhaps effectively be applied to the very few large public carriers and to large firms using their own transport , but it is a different matter with small carriers and C ' Licence holders . // The cost of enforcement must be seen , therefore , not as the amount at present spent on policing the restrictions , but the amount that would have to be spent to render them effective . There can be no doubt that to do this would be very costly indeed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Road transport is likely to become more competitive with the railway as a result of technical improvement , and as improvements to the East African road network are made . ' The roads are likely to be improved , more or less rapidly in the future depending upon the finances available , whatever the official attitude to roadrail competition , and as the roads improve road transport costs will fall . The incentive to evade the restrictions will be correspondingly increased and their enforcement correspondingly more costly . The pattern of restrictions and exemptions , if the system is not to involve a large waste of resources , will also need to become more complicated , and more difficult to operate , because the lower the cost of road transport the more frequently will exemption from restrictions be justified on cost grounds . The cost of effective enforcement of restrictions on road transport must be seen not only in financial terms and in terms of the allocation of resources , but also in terms of political and administrative difficulties . In 1958 it was argued that an attempt to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increasing reliance on the licensing system and on its enforcement to a degree that would be expensive and unpopular because of the additional staff required ' .2 The tariff has a narrower differential today , but in other ways the cogency of this argument is much increased . It has recently been said of East Africa that the problem is to prevent a disastrous dip in standards of life during the next three or four years after independence ( because ) European skills are likely to be withdrawn at a rate faster than they can be immediately replaced by African skills ' .3 It will at least be widely agreed that for some time , until a Technical improvements in road transport are making short-haul rail traffic , and traffic requiring transhipment , increasingly vulnerable to competition . . .

I. // sufficient number of Africans have had the necessary training and experience , standards of administration in many facets of public affairs will be difficult to maintain . It therefore seems most inopportune to complicate administration of the transport licensing system and to attempt to increase its effectiveness . Yet this is what the recommendations of the Madan Committee amount to . And , indeed , this is what is necessary if transport licensing is to achieve an efficient co-ordination of road and rail transport , for it must not be assumed that the failure to enforce the restrictions effectively means that the wastes of restriction may safely be ignored . ' The existing system of road transport regulation faces political difficulties . An attempt to intensify enforcement would presum-ably increase them . The African has never seen any advantage in goods vehicle licensing ' , wrote Mr. Wanyutu Waweru in a Dissenting Minute to the Madan Committee Report . Indeed he regards the present form of licensing as designed merely to prevent his entry into the goods transport industry . ' 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in Kenya , for administrative and political reasons , will be unable and unwilling effectively to enforce the present or some more complicated system of transport licensing . The situation in this respect may be pre-sumed to be similar in Tanganyika , and there is no prospect of restrictive licensing of road transport for goods being introduced in Uganda . It may be concluded that the effective enforcement of road transport licensing as it operates in Kenya and in Tanganyika 8o THE CASE FOR RESTRICTIONS is impracticable . A fortiori , any more complex system is impracti-cable . Enforcement is also undesirable , even where the social cost of diversion of traffic is not high , because of its restrictive effect on the development of African entrepreneurs and the political and administrative costs of enforcement . On the other hand , the continuation of an ineffectively enforced restriction system is also undesirable . What should be done ? One answer to this question would be the abandonment of the differential railway tariff and the adoption by the railway of a cost-based tariff.I The desirability of this solution depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It depends , in other words , on the desirability of sub-sidizing some railway traffics for , given the impossibility of finding subsidies from general public revenues , some traffics can be subsidized only if other traffics are taxed . Another answer would be to find , if it were possible , a way of restricting the operations of road transport which did not possess the disadvantages which attach to restrictions of the kind operating in Kenya . It would not , in fact , be difficult to devise a system of road transport restriction to protect the railway tariff that would be comparatively easy and cheap to administer . Road transporters could be prohibited from carrying goods on roads parallel ' with the railway . If there were no exceptions any goods vehicle seen on such a road would be presumed to be operating illegally . Enforce-ment would be comparatively easy , for it is the exceptions that complicate it . It is difficult to ensure that a C ' licensed vehicle is carrying only the owner 's goods ; it is easy to know he is operating illegally if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true , there would be certain difficulties over goods carried in passenger vehicles and goods vehicles operating empty , but such a pro-hibition would solve the major problems of enforcement . But merely to put the proposition is to see that it would , rightly , prove entirely unacceptable . All the objections , except that of administrative impracticability , to the increased enforce-ment of the present arrangements apply , a fortiori , to this more severe restriction . In addition , it could not of course be assumed THE CASE FOR RESTRICTIONS $I that the wastes of such a policy , in terms of the diversion of traffic to the railway when the social cost of road transport was lower , would be small . They would obviously be large . And it is because they would be large that it is found necessary in licensing regula-tions , as in Kenya , to permit the exceptions , the existence of which creates the difficulties of enforcement . Any policy involving such swingeing restrictions on road transport could not receive serious consideration . Fortunately , however , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some taxes to be levied in the form of high-rated rail traffic , and which therefore would enable the differential tariff to be maintained , ' yet which at the same time are practicable administratively and in terms of the costs imposed in all ways by the restrictions . Such arrangements are outlined in Chapter X. But before proceeding it is necessary to analyse the benefits of the differential tariff , for it is only in terms of these benefits that the desirability of shouldering the costs of any restrictive system can be judged . This analysis is carried out in two parts . In the next two chapters comparisons are made be-tween the present tariff and a cost-tariff , and an attempt is made to determine what the differential tariff achieves in the way of cross-subsidization of traffics , in other words , to estimate the magnitude of the taxes and subsidies on different traffics . In Chapter IX the importance of rail freight charges is examined for a number of commodities and an attempt is made to assess the probable effects of changes in the railway tariff . CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two chapters comparisons are made , with the help of certain computations , the details of which are set out in Appendix III , between the present railway tariff and a cost-based tariff . The present chapter is concerned with the comparison of the tapers of the tariffs . In Chapter VIII the general levels of the tariffs are compared and the extent of cross-subsidization is measured . The validity of the comparisons made in these two chapters can be no greater than that of the data on which they are based . Unfortunately , it can not be claimed that the quality of the data is high . The data on the pattern of traffic , which are an essential component of the calculations , are incomplete , covering only traffic on the Kenya , Uganda , Tanga Line , and only a part of that , and they are not a representative sample of all traffic . ' More important , however , are the deficiencies in the information on railway costs . Railway costing is still in its infancy in all railways , and there is some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so good , rather than that they are not better . Neverthe-less , the fact remains that in this study a somewhat formidable structure of deductions has been raised on rather flimsy founda-tions of fact . It is a dangerous doctrine in applied economics that any figures are better than no figures at all , for admitted ignorance is preferable to precisely calculated error . It is of great importance , therefore , just because cost data exist and can be employed in fairly elaborate statistical exercises , that their inadequacy should be emphasized . On the other hand , it is simply obscurantist to refuse to use figures because they are imperfect . Economic statistics are rarely otherwise , and are unlikely to be improved while they remain unused . What has to be decided in relation to any collection of figures is whether their use may be expected to throw light or shade on the subject of study . In the present instance // it appears that the area of ignorance is likely to be reduced by using data , imperfect as they are , which , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the problem of the railway tariff . The cost data produced by the railway , and used in this study , are not universally accepted within the Railways Administration , they are based too much on system-wide averages , and they take no account of some important determinants of cost . Nevertheless , it is believed that their use enlightens rather than misleads , and that the computations in which they are employed result in at least a first approximation to the truth . ' A tapered ' railway tariff is one in which the charge increases less than in proportion with the distance for which the traffic is carried . In other words , with a tapered tariff the rate per ton-mile falls as the distance increases . Tapered rates have been a common feature of railway charges , but the justification for such a tariff policy has recently been questioned . Tapered rates can be justified either on the ground that the cost of transport per ton-mile falls as the mileage increases , or on grounds unrelated to the cost of transport . It could be argued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part be overcome by tapering the railway rate . Such arguments are not concerned with costs , and they receive no further consideration at this point.2 On cost grounds there are two possible reasons for a tapered tariff . It is possible that there are certain economies in long hauls that make the movement ' 3 cost of carrying a ton of freight for a mile smaller the greater the distance for which it has already been carried . If the marginal cost of haulage did fall with the length of the haul , this in itself would be justification on cost grounds for a tapered tariff . Whatever may have been the view of railway authorities in the past , there is now a good deal of doubt as to whether costs do fall in this way . British Railways have decided that there is no evidence to justify a tapered tariff on this ground , 4 // and while it is true that conditions in East Africa are so different from those in Britain that it is unsafe to apply without further consideration conclusions reached in one country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appear to be any evidence that the marginal cost of haulage on East African Railways falls with distance . On this ground , therefore , there is no justification for a tapered tariff . But there is another characteristic of railway costs that clearly does justify a tapered rate . Each haulage involves certain terminal costs ' that are independent of the length of the haul . The terminal costs being a fixed amount irrespective of distance , the average terminal cost per mile will fall as the length of the haul increases . Average haulage costs per mile as a whole will therefore also fall with distance because of this spreading of the fixed terminal cost element . A tariff related to cost must , therefore , be tapered . The form or shape ' of the taper , if the tariff is to reflect costs , follows from the fact that the cost of haulage is made up of a fixed element independent of distance and an element that increases in direct proportion with distance . Per mile , the fixed element falls asymptotically with distance and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement cost and the two elements combined . A cost-based tariff should have the same taper as that of the combined cost . The rate of taper at any distance ( i.e. the slope of the combined cost per ton-mile curve in Diagram I at any mileage ) depends solely on the magnitude of terminal costs . The rate decreases with distance , and at any given distance the rate of taper will be bigger the bigger the terminal costs.l // An examination of the East African Railways tariff shows that the rates are tapered in quite a different way from that which results from the spreading of fixed terminal costs . There is no reason for expecting it to be otherwise , for cost is not the principle upon which the present tariff is based . Diagrams II ? IV show the various tariff classes in cents per ton-mile . It is clear that , while the taper differs from one class to another ( Class 4 being entirely untapered ) , no class has a taper remotely resembling the taper of costs . A rough and ready comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the cost taper , the tariffs are too little tapered over short distances and too steeply tapered over long distances . A more detailed comparison of the tapers in the present tariff with the taper proper to a cost-based tariff is made later in this chapter . It is not possible to explain the tapers of the present tariff by reference to cost , and an attempt to do so shows that , in fact , they imply zero terminal costs , apart from the very small element introduced by the fact that the minimum charge is that for t o miles . Indeed , it is difficult to discover any systematic basis for the tapers . One suspects they just growed ' in the course of tariff adjustments from time to time . ' The curves in Diagrams II ? IV at least appear fairly smooth , and if the tariff is plotted in the form in which the charges are quoted , not in cents per ton-mile but as a charge for carrying too pounds for a particular distance , the curve appears even smoother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge for an additional mileage at different distances is plotted , it can be seen that the variation is by no means smooth . In tariff Class 8 , for example , the incremental charge fluctuates widely , as can be seen in Diagram V.I . If a tariff quoted in terms of a charge for carrying loo pounds for each distance is modified on an ad hoc basis , it is very easy for erratic variations in the incremental rate to be created , and this is no doubt the ex-planation of the curious variations to be seen in Diagram V.2 The data available in Rail Transport Costs , 1960 make it possible , subject to the general proviso already stated about the use of these // data , l to construct a tariff for a particular commodity which will be tapered so as to reflect the relationship between cost and distance . To make a proper comparison between the taper of such a tariff and the taper of the present railway tariff is not , however , an entirely straightforward matter . The difficulty of comparison arises from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . One difference is that with which the present chapter is primarily concerned , namely , that in the relationship between charges and costs on the one hand and distance of haul on the other . The second difference is to be found in the general level of charges and costs . Even if costs were the same for all commodities carried , a difference in the general level of costs and charges would arise from the existence of the differential tariff . But since the cost per ton-mile // varies from commodity to commodity , and since the tariff for a particular commodity is in no way related to this variation , there are two reasons for a difference in the general level of charges and costs . // If a comparison is to be made of the cost and tariff tapers , and if a proper comparison is not to be vitiated by the difference in the general level of costs and charges , it is necessary in some way to equate the general level of the two . This is not so simple a matter as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equate both the cost and the charge at some particular mileage to too , and to express cost and charge at all other distances as a percentage of their value at the chosen mileage . But this procedure will not do , for the comparison obtained by this method will vary according to the mileage chosen as base , and this choice can only be an arbitrary one . The point is that to equalize the general levels of costs and charges it is necessary to equate them not at a single point but to equate their averages . But the average tariff is a quite meaningless concept unless a method of computing it is adopted that takes account of the traffic actually carried . For example , no meaningful average could be obtained if the charge at t , 000 miles were included in the averaging but no traffic actually travelled for 1,000 miles . In other words , the comparison of cost and tariff must be made by the use of weighted averages ' ; and the weights must be the volume of traffic carried for particular distances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapers appear a rather formidable undertaking , because it follows that such a comparison can not be made without fairly detailed information on the pattern of traffic . There are no published data of the necessary kind , nor are they available in an unpublished analysis in the Railways Administration 's internal documents . The basic information is , however , available as a by-product of the normal process of railway administration , and fortunately it is possible to use the analysis of Kenya-Uganda-Tanga line traffic in 196o to which reference has already been made . It is not possible to compare the cost and tariff tapers for more than a limited number of commodities , but these comparisons will be enough to provide a basis for some general conclusions , as well as to illustrate how the comparison could be made for all commodities . For the purpose of this chapter a Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff ' has been computed . The general purpose of the computations has been to obtain a scale of charges which has a taper similar to that of costs , but which if applied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAILWAY TARIFF 9 ' would yield the same revenue as the existing tariff . ' The Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff ' provides such a scale of charges . It tapers in the same way as costs taper and has an average level for each traffic equal to the average level of the Actual Tariff.2 Appendix 111 ( 1 ) A , describes the method of computation and gives as an ex-ample the detailed calculations for one commodity . Adiagrammatic comparison of the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff and the Actual Tariff in cents per ton-mile terms is made for one commodity in Diagram VI below , and for others in Appendix III(3) . Mention must be made of a further problem that has to be dealt with in the computation of a Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff . The existing Actual Tariff is applied to fictional mileages for cer-tain journeys . The distance of a haul to points in Uganda is charged as that via Kisumu , where the mileage via Kisumu is shorter than the rail route mileage that is actually used . Should a comparison of the Actual Tariff with a Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff be evaluated on the basis of the true distance for every haul ? Logically , it would seem that the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff should be computed in terms of the true mileages , because it is the true mileage that determines the cost of a haul . But there is something to be said for separating the issue of the relationship between the Actual Tariff and the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff , when both are in terms of the present chargeable miles , from the issue of the effect of the charging con-vention adopted when the railway was extended into Uganda . Two Cost-Tapered Actual Tariffs have therefore been computed . Tariff A ' is computed on the basis of the chargeable mileage ' for each journey . If applied to the traffic of I96o it would yield a revenue equal to that actually obtained in I96o , and it has a taper which conforms to the taper of costs but on the fiction that some journeys in Uganda are shorter than their true distance . ' Tariff B ' is computed on the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ' would put the taper of charges on a cost basis , given the assumption that Uganda should be trea-ted as being nearer to the coast than the true distance . The adoption // of Tariff B ' would put the taper of charges on a cost basis , and would abandon the convention adopted when the railway was extended into Uganda . ' A quite general comparison , in terms of length of haul , can be made between Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff A ' and the Actual Tariff , and the results are summarized in Table I. Such a general comparison can not , however , be made between the charges of the Actual Tariff and those of Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff B ' , be-cause the difference between the chargeable and true mileages for particular hauls must be taken into account . The comparison can be made only in terms of specific place-to-place hauls , and it is carried out in Table II . Table I shows that , in relation to the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff , the Actual Tariff for most commodities is too low for short-distance ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low for long-distance ' traffic . These relationships are illustrated in Diagram VI which shows the Actual Tariff and Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff A ' for Tea . The precise mileages to which the categories short ' , long ' , and medium ' apply vary from commodity to commodity , but for all but five of the commodities listed the short ' distance is of less than 200 miles , and for all but five of these the medium ' distance continues until over 500 miles . The adoption of the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff would , therefore , increase the charges for short- and long-distance traffic and reduce them for middle-distance hauls . On the whole , the result would be an im-provement in the competitive position of the railway . For long-distance traffic the increases would scarcely be enough to outweigh the advantage of the railway ; a loss of short-distance traffic should cause the Railways Administration little regret when the high costs of such traffic are borne in mind ; and railway charges would be reduced just for those distances where the competitive advantages of road and rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail charges is likely to have a significant effect in increasing the attractiveness of rail as compared with road . Table II is concerned with a number of particular hauls for each of the traffics . It shows the percentage change that would be made in the charge for each haul if Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff A ' or B ' were substituted for the Actual Tariff . For export traffics the charge under each tariff is shown as a percentage of the f.o.b. value of the commodity . The percentages are computed in relation to charges at the ordinary mileage rate . Where for a particular haul a special rate or a broken-taper rate is in operation , the change in relation to this charge is given in parenthesis . It is unnecessary to describe the changes in detail for all the commodities , and the following comments on some entries in the Table are designed to // illustrate the broad effects of introducing the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff . Sisal is unaffected by the difference between chargeable and true mileages , so that there is no distinction to be made between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff would raise very sharply the charges on the very short-distance traffic , of which there is a large amount in sisal . It would reduce quite substantially the charge for middle-distance traffic , such as that from Mazinde to Tanga and from Mwatate to Mombasa , and it would reduce slightly the charge on traffic over distances approaching 400 miles , such as that from Thika to Mombasa . The charge on longer-distance traffic would rise . The // transport charge as a percentage of the f.o.b. value of the commodity remains comparatively small , even for such a haul as Hoey 's Bridge to Mombasa . In cotton there is a good deal of traffic over hauls for which the chargeable and true mileages differ . Under Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff B ' the reduction in charge for hauls such as Moshi ? Mombasa and Mbale ? Mombasa is greater than under Tariff A ' . But for the haul from Kampala to Mombasa the small reduction under Tariff A ' as compared with the Actual Tariff is converted into an 8 per cent increase under Tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 871 miles . On the Rhino Camp ? Mombasa haul , however , although the true distance is greater than the chargeable distance under the Actual Tariff , it is not much greater , and the increase in charge under the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff is smaller under Tariff ' B ' than under Tariff A ' . When compared with the charge under the ordinary mileage rate of the Actual Tariff for tea , the charge for the haul from Kasese to Mombasa would be increased by 9 per cent if Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff A ' were introduced , and by 16 per cent if Tariff B ' were adopted . However , in comparison with the broken-taper rate that is now in fact charged there would be a fall of 9 per cent under Tariff A ' and of 4 per cent under Tariff B ' . In contrast is the sugar haul from Kakira to Kampala , for which a special rate is in force . This is a short haul , and in relation to the ordinary mileage rate of the Actual Tariff the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tariff A ' and by 38 per cent for Tariff B ' . But the special rate charged for this haul at present is substantially below the ordinary mileage rate , and in comparison with this special rate the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariffs would increase the charge by 195 per cent and 182 per cent , respectively . There can not be much doubt but that the introduction of a Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff would in general shift the structure of railway charges to the disadvantage of Uganda traffic . This is so for two reasons . In the first place , the rates of the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff are higher than those of the Actual Tariff for both short ' and long ' hauls , and Uganda traffic falls largely into one or other of these categories . Most traffic from Uganda to the coast and to other places outside Uganda is long-distance ' traffic , and much internal traffic is short-distance ' traffic . Secondly , Cost-Tapered Ioo THE TAPER IN THE RAILWAY TARIFF Actual Tariff B ' ( though not A ' ) increases the chargeable mileages from the fictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Uganda and elsewhere , are at present charged , to the true mileage . But the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff is not always less advantageous to Uganda traffic than the Actual Tariff . Some internal Uganda traffic is medium-distance ' traffic , and thus the charge for cotton seed from Rhino Camp to Kakira is lower under Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff A ' by 7 per cent , and under Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff B ' by 9 per cent , than the Actual Tariff , and the charge for sugar from Kakira to Nairobi is 9 per cent less than under the Actual Tariff under CostTapered Actual Tariff A ' and slightly less under Tariff ' B ' . For traffics charged at Class 4 , which is entirely untapered , the charge under the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariff is almost bound to be lower for traffic into Uganda than the Actual Tariff . Thus , cotton goods from Mombasa to Mbale are charged 4 per cent less under CostTapered Actual Tariff A ' and 11 per cent less under Tariff B ' than under the Actual Tariff , and to Kampala , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly less under CostTapered Actual Tariff B ' than under the Actual Tariff . The analysis in this chapter of the taper in the Actual Tariff in relation to the taper of a cost-based tariff was undertaken because the taper of the tariff is a matter of public concern which was in need of elucidation . But the analysis of this chapter has taken into account only one variable in railway costs , the spreading of terminal costs with the length of haul . It is one of the conclusions reached in Chapter X that the railway tariff should be based on the cost of carriage ( although with specific divergences on grounds of social policy ) , but this does not mean that the introduction of either of the Cost-Tapered Actual Tariffs is recommended . The alterations in charges that have just been discussed must be interpreted as showing what would be the consequence of modifying the tariff for each traffic to conform to the taper of costs , while maintaining the average level of charges so that each traffic yields the same total revenue as under the present tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken into account in constructing a cost-based tariff the pattern of tariff changes would be very different from that which has been analyzed in the present chapter . For example , there is no reason to suppose that the influence of other cost variables would not offset rather than reinforce the THE TAPER IN THE RAILWAY TARIFF IOI generally disadvantageous effect on Uganda traffic that has been the result of the tariff changes analyzed in this chapter . The calculations carried out and discussed in Chapters VIII and IX and Appendix III , and the recommendations that arise from them in Chapter X , take into account the effect on cost not only of the length of haul , but also of the all-important cost factor of " loadability " ' . I CHAPTER VIII THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION THROUGH THE RAILWAY TARIFF It was pointed out in Chapter IV that the published figures of the average revenue per ton-mile for each rate class do not very precisely reflect the formal structure of the railway tariff , because they are the result not only of the tariff class , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , the effective average rate for the traffic in each class ; ' though within each class there is a wide dispersion around the class average.2 It might be supposed that a comparison of the average effective rate for all traffic ( 19.4 cents ) with the effective rate for each class of traffic , to show which traffics on average were low-rated and which high-rated in relation to the average rate , would at the same time show which classes of traffic were subsidized and which taxed ' . There are , however , two reasons why an analysis of where the subsidies and taxes lie ( and still more of their magnitude ) can not be based on such a simple comparison of average effective rates . The first reason is that the cost per ton-mile varies with the length of haul ; that is , there is a taper of costs . Secondly , for any given distance , costs vary for different traffics for several reasons , of which variations in the load is the one which it has been possible to take into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step , consideration is given to the way in which account can be taken of the distance taper , on the assumption that there are no other causes of differences in the cost of different traffics . Because there is a taper of cost , even if there were no other differences in the cost of different traffics , an adequate analysis of the cross-subsidization of traffic could be based on the figures of average revenue per ton-mile only if the average haul were of the same length for each class of trafficIn factas may be seen from Table I // there is great variation from one class to another in the average length of haul . It would be possible for a class of traffic yielding an average revenue per ton-mile lower than the average revenue for all traffic , to be nevertheless a taxed , not a subsidized traffic , if the average length of haul were much longer for the traffic in that class than for traffic as a whole . Conversely , a class of traffic with an effective rate of more than 19.4 c.p-t-m. could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sufficiently short . Any analysis of the incidence of subsidies and taxes under the Actual Tariff which is not to be vitiated by the effect of these variations in the average distance for which the different traffics are hauled , must therefore be based on a tariff which has been standardized ' for variations in the length of haul . The analysis has been made in terms of a Cost-Tapered Average Tariff ' which has a taper corresponding to the taper of costs and a value equal to the average revenue from all traffic at a distance equal to the average length of haul for all traffic . ' For a haul of 394 miles , that is , the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff has a value of 19.4 cents per ton-mile . The value of the tariff for shorter hauls is higher , and for longer hauls lower than this average value . Any given average length of haul can result from many different distributions of traffic with respect to length of haul . Under the Actual Tariff , because of the form of the taper , the average revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off haul , but is affected by the distribution around the average . This is not so , however , with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff . Traffic with a given average length of haul will yield the same revenue for all distributions around the average if this tariff is applied . The incidence of taxes and subsidies will therefore depend on the distribution of lengths of haul for each traffic , because this will determine the revenue under the Actual Tariff . But for any distribution the assessment is correctly made in relation to the CostTapered Average Tariff ( if the effect simply of standardizing ' the length of haul is to be examined ) . The values of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff are set out in Table I , column ( d ) , for the average haul of the traffic in each tariff class , as given in column ( b ) . Table I , column ( c ) shows the average I04 THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION revenue actually derived from the traffic of 196o under the prevailing tariff . If no account is taken of differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those in length of haul , it may be deduced from Table I that the traffic in a particular tariff class is subsidized on average if the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff rate in column ( d ) is greater than the // in length of haul ) taxes some traffics and subsidizes others to the extent of ? 2.7 mn.l This is a substantial cross-subsidization amounting to 17 per cent of total revenue . Not far short of one-half of the total tax derives from bulk oil traffic , on which the tax amounts to nearly one-third of total revenue . The remainder of the tax is spread over the traffic in Classes 4 to 8 , though more than 40 per cent is raised from traffic in Class 4 , on which the rate of tax is nearly 50 per cent . The most heavily subsidized traffic is that in Class Io , the sub-sidy on which is more than one-half the total revenue from that class . More than one-quarter of the total subsidy goes on Class i o traffic , although it contributes no more than , 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . The average haul of this traffic is short , so that it is relatively costly per ton-mile ; in tonnage it amounts to 29 per cent of the total in the four subsi-dized classes , but to only 16 per cent in terms of ton-miles . Traffic in the Exceptional Class is also heavily subsidized , to the extent of 43 per cent of the revenue it yields , and taking about one-third of total subsidies . This traffic , like that in Class lo , consists of a large tonnage hauled for relatively short distances . Export traffic is // subsidized to the extent of almost one-third of its revenue ; it absorbs 39 per cent of total subsidies , but in terms of ton-miles it accounts for 54 per cent of the traffic in the four subsidized classes . A more detailed analysis of the pattern of subsidies and taxes must be done in terms of particular commodities , and at the same time the restrictive assumption of the previous calculations can be relaxed , and account can be taken of differences in the cost of carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in length of haul . The analysis is made in terms of a Cost Tariff ' for each traffic . The values of the Cost Tariffs for the different traffics reflect not only the differences in the length of haul but also the wide differences that exist in the wagon loading achieved for different commodities ) . The data available make it possible to estimate the subsidies and taxes for a number of com-modities . Only a part of the total taxes and subsidies is covered by this analysis , but it is a big enough part to enable some general conclusions to be drawn . Table III deals with the main export commodities.2 Part ( A ) sets out the average haul for each commodity , the average revenue per ton-mile yielded by the traffic in the commodity , and the appropriate values of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff and the Cost Tariff . Part ( B ) shows the total revenue from traffic in each commodity yielded by the Actual Tariff in 1960,3 and the revenue that would have accrued from the traffic under the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between the actual revenue yielded by traffic in each commodity and the revenue that would have accrued if the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff and the Cost Tariff had been applied to the traffic . Where the revenue yielded would have been smaller than the actual revenue the difference is given a minus sign , and where it would have been larger the difference is given a plus sign . If the revenue that the Cost Tariff , for example , would have yielded is greater than the actual revenue , the Actual Tariff subsidizes the IIo THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION traffic in relation to the Cost Tariff . If , on the other hand , the actual revenue is greater than the revenue that would have ac-crued under the Cost Tariff , the Actual Tariff taxes ' the com-modity . In Table III ( C ) , therefore , subsidies are identified by a plus sign and taxes by a minus sign . Part ( D ) shows the taxes and sub-sidies as a proportion of the revenue yielded by the Actual Tariff . The totals in Table III are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on export traffic , when the Actual Tariff is compared with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , is therefore that shown in Table II . The distribution of this subsidy between com-modities is very unequal . Three commodities , sisal , cattle cake and soda , account for nearly three-quarters of the total , and three commodities , coffee , tea and pyrethrum , are not subsidized but taxed . The distribution of the subsidy between the commodities is a function of two variables : the actual tariff for the particular commodity2 and the length of haul . Both variables influence the actual average revenue per ton-mile from a particular com-modity . The length of haul determines the rate under the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff . The estimate of the tax or subsidy in relation to the Cost Tariff , however , is affected by an additional variable : the average load of the commodity in a wagon . ' The subsidies are smaller ( or the taxes bigger ) when comparison is made with the Cost Tariff than with the Cost-Tapered Average THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION III Tariff for every commodity the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average than the average load for all goods traffic . This is the situation with all except two of the commodities analyzed . Only with tea and timber is the average load lower than the average for goods traffic as a whole , and for these commodities the relationship between the Cost Tariff and the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is the reverse of that for the other traffics . The sum of the subsidies and taxes , when comparison is made between the Actual Tariff and the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , amounts to a net subsidy on export traffic of a little more than ? I million . But the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is merely a first approximation to a tariff based on costs ; it does no more than take into account differences in the length of haul which are ig-nored in the even cruder , but common , comparison between the average revenue yielded by a particular commodity and that yielded by goods traffic as a whole . When the analysis is carried a stage further , and a comparison is made with the Cost Tariff , a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked that the use of the Cost Tariff instead of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff reduces the subsidies and in-creases the taxes ; and it does so to such an extent that the general picture is fundamentally changed . The total of the three largest subsidies is reduced from ? 4 mn. to a little more than ? 4 mn. ; the subsidy on cotton is transformed into a tax ; and the tax of L62,000 on coffee is increased to one of L329,000 . The total effect is to reduce the net subsidy on export traffic from over ? I Inn . to a mere ? 15,000 ; the net subsidy on exports in effect dis-appears.l Most export traffics , it is true , are still shown to be sub-sidized , but the two most important export commodities , coffee and cotton , which account for nearly one-half of total export traffic revenue , are shown to be taxed , while the only traffics substantially subsidized are cattle cake and , to a lesser extent , oil-seeds and soda . The dominant feature of the distribution of the taxes and subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzes the pattern of subsidies on Exceptional Rates traffic . Again it is seen that for most of the traffics for which // it is possible to compute a Cost Tariff , the subsidies are smaller when assessed on the basis of the Cost Tariff than when computed with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , and again the reason is that the average loads for these traffics are greater than the average load for goods traffic as a whole . The exception is vehicles , for which the change from a computation using the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff to one using the Cost Tariff converts a large tax into a large subsidy . Vehicles are high-rated , but not highly enough to balance the very poor loading obtained . The average revenue under the Actual Tariff for the average length of haul ( 58 c.p.t.m. ) is high in relation to the value of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff for that haul ( 19 c.p.t.m. ) , but it is low in relation to cost ( 112 c.p.t.m. ) when the low wagon loading obtained with vehicles is taken into account . The net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the Cost Tariff , is a subsidy for Exceptional Rates traffic as a whole of about ? 66o,000.1 This total figure is somewhat smaller than that obtained from the calculation using the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , and it is , of course , distributed very differently between the different commodities . Most of the subsidy is on the traffic in vehicles ; the subsidy on grains is reduced to about one-third of its level in the earlier calculation ; I14 THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION and the subsidies on other commodities ? even that on fertilizersare not large in absolute terms . Table V deals with bulk oil traffic . There is no very great difference in the estimate of the taxes on this traffic when the // calculation is carried out using the Cost Tariff rather than the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff . There is a comparatively small increase in the tax on each of the products when the Cost Tariff is used , l and the estimated total tax on bulk oil traffic is increased to very nearly ? i 2 million . It must , however , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is of less and the Cost Tariff of more significance than they are in relation to other goods traffic . The Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is based on the average load and the average empty haul for all traffic . The Cost Tariff takes account of variations from the average in the load , but lack of data generally prevents account being taken of variations in the importance of empty haulage . For bulk oil traffic , however , the empty haulage is known to be I o0 per cent2 of the loaded mileage . In computing the magnitude of the taxes on bulk oil with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , therefore , a comparison is being made that is wrong not only with respect to the load but also to the empty haulage , whereas in carrying out the calculation with the Cost Tariff the correct values for both of these variables are used . The calculation using the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is , therefore , when applied to bulk oil traffic , a very artificial exercise . The reason why the // estimates obtained are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cost of bulk oil traffic is reduced below the average by a more than average load and raised above the average by a more than average empty haulage ; the two variations from the average affect costs in opposite directions . Table VI deals with Class 10 traffic , the other category of traffic which Table II suggests is substantially subsidized under the present tariff . The available data are a good deal more scanty than for the classes of traffic analyzed above but , so far as they go , they point to the same general conclusion . A comparison with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff overstates the extent to which the traffic is subsidized under the present Actual Tariff , because the traffics in Class 1 o in general have a wagon loading greater than the average for goods traffic as a whole . In particular , the apparent // heavy subsidy on cement ? by far the most important commodity in Class lo ? is virtually eliminated when account is taken of the loadability of cement . Table VII deals with the other commodities for which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidies or taxes . These six commodities account for rather more than one-third of the total revenue from traffics in Rate Classes I-8 . On the basis of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff the traffic in these commodities is taxed to the extent of ? 482,000 , and on the basis of the Cost Tariff by 66g,000 . The estimated tax on the four commodities which have a wagon loading greater than that for goods traffic as a whole is increased when the calculation is made with the Cost Tariff instead of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff . I18 THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION The estimate of the tax on machinery and cotton goods is reduced , however , when the Cost Tariff basis is adopted . Both these com-modities have a wagon loading below the average . // It is now possible to summarize the results set out in the preceding tables so as to show , first , the total subsidies and taxes on the commodities for which these magnitudes can be assessed , and , secondly , the size of the tax or subsidy on the remainder of the traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIII . The balance of subsidies and taxes over the traffic as a whole is , by definition , zero . The net total of identified subsidies and taxes must , therefore , be balanced by an equal and opposite aggregate of taxes and subsidies on the remainder of the traffic . The commodities for which no estimates have been made are classified in Table IX by rate class and by the revenue they yield . I20 THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION Classes I to 8 contain roughly two-thirds , in terms of revenue , of the total of the traffics for which it has been impossible to analyze the pattern of taxes and subsidies . Table VIII shows that , when the calculation is made with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , the identified taxes and subsi-dies total to a net subsidy of ? 641,000 . It can be seen from Table VIII ( B ) that the net tax of L641,000 which must therefore be borne by traffic for which no detailed analysis has been possible , accrues from commodities in Classes 1 to 8.1 The total unidentified taxes on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class 9 , and Class 1 o traffic.2 Table II shows a total // tax of ? 1,474,000 on traffic in Classes I to 8. ? 482,000 of this total has been identified in Table VII ; the remaining ? 992,000 appears in Table VIII ( S ) . All these calculations are in terms of a comparison between the Actual Tariff and the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , and the conclusions appear consistent with the general belief that the traffics in Classes I to 8 are the high-rated , taxed traffics , while exports are low-rated and subsidized . The situation looks very different , however , when it is presented in terms of a comparison between the Actual Tariff and the Cost Tariff . When the estimation of the taxes and subsidies is carried out on this basis , the subsidy on export traffic virtually disappears because of the large tax on coffee exports ( See Tables III and VIII . ) . The identified subsidy on Exceptional traffic becomes ? 661,000 ( See Tables IV and VIII. ) , and that on Class to traffic ? 196,000 ( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , total ? 872,000 instead of the estimate of ? 2,379,000 when the calculations are carried out with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff . The identified taxes on the basis of the Cost Tariff , on the other hand , at ? 2,155,000 , are rather larger than on the basis of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , because of a larger estimate of the identified taxes on bulk oil and on traffic in Classes I to 8 ( See Tables V , VII and VIII . ) . The total of identified taxes and subsidies is , therefore , a net tax of ? I , 283,000 as compared with a net subsidy of ? 641,000 when the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is used as the basis of estimation . Unidentified subsidies on Export , Exceptional , Class 10 , and Class g traffic ( the estimate of their value with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is ? 353,000 ) might be assumed to reduce the net tax to around ? 1 mn . This net tax must be balanced by equivalent subsidies on traffic for which no analysis has been possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net subsidy of some ? 1 mn. on the traffics in Classes I to 8 , other than those dealt with in Table VII . The revenue from these traffics in 196o amounted to ? 3,033,000 , so that our conclusion implies that they were subsidized to the extent of 33 per cent . This conclusion is surprising and , at first sight , perhaps extremely puzzling . Classes 1 to 8 are the high-rated classes , and it must seem unreasonable to conclude that the bulk of the traffic in these classes is , nevertheless , heavily subsidized . It is necessary , therefore , first of all to ask whether there is any way to escape I22 THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION from the conclusion that has been reached , and secondly , if no such escape is possible , to attempt to explain ( so far as the available data allow ) why the conclusion is , after all , not un-reasonable . In the first place , the possibility must be recognized that the unidentified subsidies are to a far greater extent than has been allowed on commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Export , Exceptional , and other subsidized classes ' . Traffic of this kind contributed a total revenue in I96o of ? I , 726,000 . ( See Table IX . ) If the whole of the unidentified subsidy of ? I , 283,00o were accountable for in this way , the rate of subsidy on this traffic would be 74 per cent , and the unidentified traffics in Classes 1 ? 8 ( i.e. , Class i ? 8 traffics other than those dealt with in Table VII ) would then break even ' . If these Class i ? 8 traffics were taxed , as is usually believed to be the case , the unidentified subsidy on traffic in the four subsidized classes ' would , of course , have to be correspondingly larger . On the face of it , there is no reason why the unidentified subsidy should not be on those traffics in the four subsidized classes ' for which detailed analysis has been impossible . A further look at the matter , however , suggests that it is an unlikely explanation . For almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subsidy with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff to esti-mating it with the Cost Tariff reduces the size of the subsidy . It does so because the wagon loading of the commodities is above the average for all traffic , and the difference between the Cost-Tapered Average and the Cost Tariffs is that the latter takes account of variations from the average in the loadability achieved for a particular commodity . Only for those commodities where the wagon loading achieved is below the average for all goods traffic does a change in the basis of estimation to that of the Cost Tariff lead to a rise in the estimated subsidy . If the missing subsidy ' is on the Other ' traffic in the four subsidized classes , the subsidy on that traffic would have to rise from ? 353,000 to ? I ; 283,000 when the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is replaced by the Cost Tariff in computing the subsidy.l This would happen only if the wagon loading for these commodities were much below the average for goods traffic as a whole . The data available do not allow the // point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but the likelihood of this being the situation can be roughly assessed if the commodities concerned can be identified and a guess made as to whether or not they are likely to have very light wagon loadings . The export commodities included in the Other ' category in Table III can be identified to some extent by a comparison be-tween the commodities listed in that table and the list of the principal commodities exported given in the Annual Report , ' 960.2 The more important commodities in that list which do not appear separately in Table III are : Table On the basis of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff the Other ' ex-port traffic is subsidized only to the extent of ? 2,000 . It is possible that this figure would be increased by the use of the Cost Tariff because some of the commodities in this traffic might have a lighter than average loading , but it can not be imagined that any significant part of the missing subsidy can be accounted for by this traffic . The possibilities are clearly greater with the Other ' traffic at Exceptional rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , amounts to J ' 86,000 . The revenue contributed by this traffic is ? 263,000 . About one-half the total is contributed by Congo Imports and Military Traffic , both o which are relatively highly rated , the average revenue being greater than the appropriate value of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , 3 so that in terms of that tariff they are taxed . If their // wagon loading is very low , this tax could be converted into a subsidy when the basis of computation is changed to the Cost Tariff , but it is difficult to think that any large part of the unidentified subsidy can be attributed to this traffic . The remaining Other ' Exceptional rates traffic can not readily be identified from the Tariff Book . It presumably consists not only of coal and coke and trellis , fencing and mining ' , which are the only commodities listed in the General Classification of Goods ' as being charged Special Rates A , B , C , or D , and which have not already been considered , ' but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' .2 It is impossible to say anything much in general terms about such a mixed traffic , but again it is difficult to believe that any great part of the missing subsidy of ? I mn. can be attributed to this traffic , the revenue from which amounted to ? 300,000 in 196o , with a subsidy , in relation to the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff of ? 146,000 . A mere glance at the list of the Class 9 commodities for which no detailed analysis has been possible , 3 suggests that the traffic in many of the items must be negligible ; salt , aerated waters , beer , and various building materials perhaps contribute most of the traffic in Class 9 . The total revenue from Class 9 traffic is L377,000 , and the subsidy on the basis of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff is ? 24,000 . It is likely that a calculation on the basis of the Cost Tariff would produce a larger estimate of the subsidy , but no very great part of the unidentified subsidy can reasonably be attributed to traffic in Class 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rather more than two-thirds of the traffic in Class I o.4 The traffic in // many of the other commodities ' must be negligible . Building materials of one kind or another , sugar cane , scrap metal , fire-wood , and fodder perhaps contribute the bulk of the ? 421,000 revenue derived from Other ' Class to traffic . The subsidy on this traffic , when measured in terms of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , is ? 241,000 and although this estimate might be increased if the subsidy were measured in terms of the Cost Tariff , it is diffi-cult to think that the wagon loading of the traffic is so far below the average for all goods that the subsidy would be extremely large . In fact , it seems probable that the subsidy would be smaller when measured with the Cost Tariff than with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff , because the loading , which for the identified traffic in Class 10 is 10 .35 tons , is likely to be above , not below the average . All in all , it must be concluded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the estimate of the subsidy on Other ' traffic in the four subsidized Classes above the rough estimate of ? 283,000 , it would not be realistic to increase it to an extent that would make a significant impression on the total unidentified subsidy on Classes i ? 8 traffic , which has been tenta-tively assessed at around f i mn . There are other possibilities which would vitiate the estimates of subsidies and taxes on the basis of the Cost Tariff . All the esti-mates of subsidies and taxes , other than those on bulk oil traffic , have been made on the assumption that the average empty haulage proportion for all goods traffic applied to each class and to each commodity within each class . Lack of information made it I26 THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION impossible to adopt any other assumption . But if it so happens that the traffic for which the taxes and subsidies have been identified has an amount of empty haulage above the average , the cost of that traffic will be greater than has been assumed in the calcula-tions . ) The size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-estimated and that of the identified subsidies under-esti-mated . As a result , the net identified tax , and hence the unidenti-fied subsidy , will in fact be smaller than estimated . In this way , the problem of identifying the missing subsidies could disappear . There is no information at present available on empty haulage for particular commodities which would enable the true situation to be assessed . Until data of this kind are available , all that can be done is to acknowledge the possibility , though not indeed the probability , that the true costs of particular traffics ( when allowance is made for the true level of empty haulage ) are so different from those computed on the basis of average empty haulage that no valid conclusions can be drawn from computations on the latter basis.2 There are two other factors , not taken into account in the calculations , that could affect the results . First , loading and un-loading costs have been ignored , for the terminal costs in the computations cover only in-wagon terminal costs . A large part of all traffic is loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs do not fall on the railway , 3 but no information is available about the extent to which particular commodities are handled out of wagon by the railway . If the commodities on which subsidies and taxes have been identified are handled largely by the railway , and the traffics on which it has been deduced that there are unidentified subsidies are handled largely by the consigners and consignees , the net identified tax will have been over-estimated // and the unidentified subsidy correspondingly over-estimated . Part of the unidentified subsidy could be accounted for in this way . Secondly , all the computations have been carried out on the assumption that all traffic in a particular commodity is carried in loads equal to the average load indicated by a sampling of the traffic . No doubt some of the traffic is carried in smaller loads , so that the number of wagons used in carrying the total volume of the commodity will in practice have been larger than that implied in the calculations , so that the true total cost of moving the given tonnage will have been larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind may have affected the estimates of identified taxes and subsidies , leading to an overstatement of the former and an understatement of the latter . The effect can not , however , be large , because that part of the traffic carried in lighter loads ? at any rate for most of the subsidized commodities ? will often have been charged at the higher Small Quantity rate instead of at the Wagon Load rate , so that revenue as well as cost will have been under-estimated . It may be concluded that , although the estimates may to some extent understate the magnitude of the subsidies on traffic in the four subsidized classes , they are unlikely to do so ( unless the differences in empty haulage are such as completely to transform the picture ) to an extent that would account for anything like the whole of the unidentified subsidy of ? I mn . No escape has been found , therefore , from the conclusion that there are heavy subsidies on traffics in Classes I ? 8 . Is it , therefore , possible to find independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few data on the characteristics of the traffic in these classes , but there are some data which lend support to the view that it is subsidized . By comparison with the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff the traffic in Classes I ? 8 is taxed under the present Actual Tariff . In total the tax amounts to ? I , 474,000 ( Table II ) , and when the identified taxes listed in Table VII are deducted there remains an unidentified tax on the rest of the traffic of ? 992,000 . The Cost-Tapered Average Tariff differs from the Cost Tariff in that the latter takes account of the actual wagon loading for the particular commodity , whereas the former relates to the average load for all goods traffic . The Cost Tariff is , therefore , below the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff when the wagon loading is greater than the average , and above it when the loading is I28 THE EXTENT OF CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION smaller than the average . A traffic which appears to be taxed in terms of the Cost-Tapered Average Tariff would be shown to be subsidized in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average . Such data as are available suggest that much of the traffic in Classes I-8 , other than that dealt with in Table VII , has a wagon loading substantially below the average . Rail Transport Costs , 1960 shows the average load per unit of public traffic to be 8.9 tons . Sample checks on the average loadings of several imported com-modities in Classes I ? 8 give the results set out in Table X. These figures suggest that the traffic in Classes I-8 , other than that in the commodities which it has been possible to analyze in Table VII , does have an average wagon loading substantially below the average for all traffic . This fact establishes the probability that the traffic is , in fact , subsidized rather than taxed . And it is possible to go further than merely to establish the probability that this is so . The average wagon load of the traffics which have been analyzed in Tables III to VII amounts to I o .8 tons per unit . ' . Given the average loading for all traffic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this average loading of I o .8 tons for the identified traffics implies an average loading of 5.3 tons per unit for the unidentified traffic in all classes . These estimated loadings are consistent with the estimates of revenue under the Cost Tariff , and hence with the estimates of the subsi-dies and taxes under that tariff . Computations using the data of Rail Transport Costs , 196o , together with these figures of average loadings , and the average hauls and total ton-miles of the identi-fied and unidentified traffics , yield an estimated revenue under the Cost Tariff of x ' 9.7 mn. from the former , and ? 6 . I mn. for the latter group of traffics . The difference between these figures and the figures of the actual revenue from the traffics shows that the identified traffics were taxed and the unidentified traffics subsi-dized to the tune of ? I .3 mn.2 This alternative method of calculation , therefore , yields the same result as was obtained from the original calculation which // estimated the tax on the unidentified traffic by difference . ' The conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of them in the high-rated classes , are heavily subsidized is explained by the fact that they have an average wagon loading far below the average for all traffic , and equal to less than half that of the identified traffics . The nature of the unidentified traffics in the Export , Exceptional and 9 and 10 Classes2 does not suggest that they are subject to particularly light wagon loadings , whereas the evidence presented in Table X does point to light loadings on Classes 1 ? 8 . It seems most probable , therefore , that the unidenti-fied traffics in Classes 1 ? 8 are subsidized to an extent not far short of ? I mn . TABLE X SAMPLE AVERAGE LOADS ( TONS ) PER WAGON UNIT Commodity Rate Class Load per unit Electrical Apparatus and Machinery 4/7 ( SQ ) 6.9 Fencing Material 8 ( SQ ) 6.2 Fresh Fruit 8 7.0 General Goods 4 6.4 Glassware , etc. 4 7.8 Packing Material 6 ( SQ ) 5.4 Pipes , etc. 7 ( SQ ) 6.8 Provisions 4 8.9 Timber 8 ( SQ ) 3.7 Tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found , not so much in the precise magnitude of the subsidy , but in the fact that these high rated traffics are heavily subsidized . It is unlikely that this conclusion would be seriously affected if more adequate data than are at present available were used in the computations . CHAPTER IX THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL TARIFF There can be no doubt of the importance attached by many people in East Africa to the maintenance of the railways ' differential tariff . A Kenya Minister of Commerce and Industry has said it was essential for the economic well-being of the East African territories that the railways ' differential freight tariff be maintained ' , the Chairman of the Kenya Cereal Producers ' ( Scheduled Areas ) Board has argued that its effective continuance is essential not only to farmers ' interests but to the whole economy of Kenya ... ( and that ) under no circumstances should farmers support or agree to any further erosion of the differential tariff system , which is so essential to their interests ' , and a Uganda representative in a Chamber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff as absolutely essential to the economies of the territories . ' It has already been pointed out in Chapter V that the Committees which considered the question of road transport licensing in Kenya and in Tanganyika both accepted the paramount importance of the maintenance of the differential tariff . This apparent unanimity of conviction does not , it seems , arise from any explicit and detailed analysis of the benefits of the differential tariff . The differential tariff has become more an article of faith than an instrument of economic policy . Nowhere ? least of all in the Madan Committee Reports ? do its effects appear to have been dispassionately examined and analyzed . An attempt has been made in Chapter VIII to assess the extent and nature of the cross-subsidization of railway traffics achieved by the differential tariff and , even when allowance is made for the inadequacy of the data used in the analysis , it was found to be very different from what is generally believed . There is reason to think that the original intention of the tariff classification was that traffic in Classes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classes 7 and 8 should broadly reflect costs , and that other traffic should be subsidized . The analysis of Chapter VIII suggests that this is not at all the pattern of cross-subsidization in practice . In brief , it was // found that many of the subsidized traffics are subsidized to a much smaller extent than is commonly supposed , and that some of the traffics which it is commonly supposed are taxed are , in fact , subsidized . It may be wondered whether , if these facts were understood , support for the present tariff structure would be quite so fervent . In the present chapter an attempt is made at a different but complementary analysis of the effects of the differential tariff . Comparisons are made for a variety of commodities and hauls of the charges under the present tariff and under a cost-based tariff . These comparisons are presented in terms of the percentage change in the amount charged and in terms of the change in rail freight in relation to the value of the commodity . The percentage change in the freight charge , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , of course , it depends on the class of the Actual Tariff in which the particular commodity is included , for that determines the charge under the Actual Tariff for any haul . Secondly , it depends on the wagon loading of the commodity , for the charge under the Cost Tariff is low for commodities with a greater than average wagon loading , and high for those for which the wagon loading is less than average . Finally , it depends on the length of the haul , because the taper of the Cost Tariff is different from the tapers of the present tariff , being in general steeper for short and less steep for long distances . The relationship , for any particular haul of any particular commodity , between the charge under the Actual Tariff and under the Cost Tariff is the result of these three variables . The effect of a low-rated class of the Actual Tariff can be outweighed by the effect of good wagon loading , so that the charge under the Cost Tariff is below that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference in taper might swing the charge in the other direction . It can be seen from Table I that this is the situation with traffic in cotton . Cotton is charged at the relatively low Class 9 rates , but it has a relatively high loading of 9.4 tons , so that the charge under the Cost Tariff is below that of the Actual Tariff by 13.7 per cent for the rather short haul from Moshi to Mombasa , by 9 per cent for the haul from Mbale to Mombasa , and by 7 .3 per cent for traffic from Kampala to Mombasa . However , for the very long haul to Mombasa from lo // Rhino Camp the Cost Tariff charge is 0.4 per cent above that of the Actual Tariff . A poor wagon loading , on the other hand , can outweigh the effect of a relatively high-rated tariff class , so that the charge under the Cost Tariff is above that of the Actual Tariff , particularly for long-distance traffic . Unfortunately , the traffic sample on which the computations are based is deficient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation by reference to specific hauls . However , the data in Chapter VIII make possible a general exemplification of the point . They show that although the average revenue per ton-mile from rail traffic in motor vehicles is nearly three times the average revenue per ton-mile from all traffic , the average cost per ton-mile of traffic in vehicles is almost twice the average revenue received from it . Vehicles are clearly a highrated traffic in relation to the average revenue from all traffic ; nevertheless , the charges under the Cost Tariff are above those of the Actual Tariff . For the most high-rated traffic , that in Class 4 , except when it is over rather short distances , and when the loading is very poor , the charge under the Actual Tariff is likely to be above that of the Cost Tariff , because Class 4 rates are entirely untapered . The Class 4 rate for cotton goods , for instance , at 38 cents per ton-mile , is above the Cost Tariff charge for all distances over 1 to miles , and the divergence increases with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference in the taper results in the Cost Tariff charge being above that of the Actual Tariff , whatever the rate class and wagon loading . The statistics which are presented in Table I , and which have just been briefly reviewed , indicate a number of features of the differential tariff that appear inconsistent with the generally accepted view of its effects . They show , in the first place , what has already been explained in this study , that a narrowing of the differential towards the average rate per ton-mile yielded by all traffic would in no way be a move in the direction of a cost-based tariff . The average revenue yielded by traffic in vehicles amounts to 57.7 c.p.t.m. , compared with the average revenue for all traffic of 19.4 c.p.t.m. , but the average revenue under the Cost Tariff would be 112.5 c.p.t.m . A narrowing of the differential for this traffic would increase the divergence between charges and costs . The Table also shows that it is a far too simple view of matters to assume that if charges were based on cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while imports and manufactures generally would be carried at lower charges than at present . For some important export traffics , the combined effect of the loading and the length of haul is such that the charge under the Cost Tariff is below the present charge . On the other hand , as was shown to be the case with vehicles , for some imported goods a charge based on cost would be above the present charge . It is certainly untrue that a general adoption of the Cost Tariff would have a universally unfavourable impact on agricultural , mining , and industrial , development in the Territories ' . A further point emerges when the charges under the Actual and Cost Tariffs are compared with the values of the commodities . This comparison is most readily made for export traffics , for which f.o.b. values can be obtained from the trade returns . The figures in // Table I suggest , first , that for many export traffics freight charges are not a very important part of the f.o.b. value , and that , secondly , the adoption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-duction in the freight charge , would not very greatly increase it as a proportion of the f.o.b. value of the commodity . Cattle cake and maize , both of which have low f.o.b. values and are low-rated under the Actual Tariff , are the exception to these two generaliza-tions . If rail freight is not a particularly large element in the f.o.b. prices of most of East Africa 's exports of primary produce , it might be expected , a fortiori , in spite of a higher-rated tariff class , that it would be an even smaller element in the retail price of consumer goods , which will mostly be of much higher value in relation to their weight . Examination of the retail prices and rail freight charges for a number of consumer goods supports this presump-tion . It also suggests two other conclusions . ' One is that the varia-tion in the retail price of a given article from one shop to another can be many times more than the whole of the freight element in the price.2 The other conclusion is that the difference in retail prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be its cause , is certainly in no way a simple reflection of the difference in freight costs.3 The relative unimportance of freight rates , except for a few traffics , makes it surprising that so much significance is attributed to the assistance given by the differential tariff . It might be concluded // that the exaggerated importance attributed to the differential tariff , and the belief in the dire consequences of its abandon-ment , arise from the fact that there has been no proper assessment of its effects , and of what changes would result from the adoption of a cost-based tariff . ' In the absence of such an assessment opinions , however strongly held , have necessarily been ill-informed . Although it has been concluded that an exaggerated importance is commonly given to the differential tariff in East Africa , this is not to deny that there is a case for the cross-subsidization of traffics through the railway tariff , or to suggest that the tariff could not be used as an important instrument of economic policy . It was argued in Chapter III that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport at less than cost , although it was eminently desirable that the assistance should be provided in ways which did not stimulate a wasteful use of resources in transport . And a primary purpose of this study is to suggest how this might be done . But one conclusion , the importance of which is emphasized by the results of the analysis in this chapter and in Chapter VIII , is that the assistance should be provided with a greater knowledge of what , in fact , is being achieved than appears to be the case at present . A decision to subsidize certain industries is a matter of economic and social policy , and it is desirable that decisions of policy should be taken in the light of the facts . The facts , it has been suggested , are that only a part of the cross-subsidization can be construed as assisting agricultural , mining , and industrial , development in the Territories ' , and that a very substantial part of the total can not be justified on such grounds . It is also worth considering whether there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff , although assistance to them would further the aims of policy . There is some reason to think that the tariff is too much directed to the assis-tance of East Africa 's traditional primary products , and is too little concerned with fostering industrial development . There are // instances in which the tariff does not differentiate between the manufactured and unmanufactured condition of a commodity , so that a manufacturer in East Africa obtains no advantage over imports of the finished product . ' The desirability of providing assistance to manufacturing activities seems likely to increase , and in pursuit of the general policy laid down in the Act more atten-tion than at present might well be given to it . This reference to traffics which might be assisted in pursuit of the general ends of policy draws attention to a difficulty in which the Railways Administration are placed by the Act . The directions to the Administration in the Act are of the most general kind and do not , naturally enough in legislation , specify either the traffics to be assisted or the scale of assistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely on the Railways Administra-tion , and it is a burden that they should not have to bear . The decisions involve matters of policy which require consideration in a wider context than is possible for the Railways Administration and which should properly be in the hands of the East African Common Services Organization , 2 as the agent of the three Governments , or of the government of the proposed East African Federation . The Railways Administration should determine the charges needed to distribute the subsidies , but they should not also have to decide what is and what is not to be subsidized . The discussion so far has been primarily concerned with the subsidization and taxation of particular traffics , and nothing explicit has been said about the distribution of the taxes and sub-sidies between places . Subsidization and taxation of particular traffics has an unequal geographical impact because of the un-equal geographical distribution of traffics . A decision to subsidize a particular commodity is at the same time a decision to subsidize the places in which the production of the commodity is      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
