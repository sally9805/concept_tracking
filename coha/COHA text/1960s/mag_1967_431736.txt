 | The West 's Land of Surprises THE AIR 1S SO dry here I can hardly shave in the mornings . The water and lather dry upon my face as I reach for the razor : aridity . The inch of snow that falls during a stormy night in the middle of May has all disappeared an hour after sunrise , except in shaded places , and an hour after the snow melts the surface of the desert is again bone-dry . It seldom rains . The geography hooks credit this portion of Utah with nine to ten inches of precipitation per year but this is merely an average . Actual rainfall and snowfall vary widely from year to year . There are a few perennial springs hidden in secret places , known only to the deer and the coyotes , to myself and a few friends , but the water does not flow far before vanishing into the air and under the ground . Even the rain , when it comes , does not always fall to the ground but can often be seen evaporating halfway down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture by tantalizing . Bare Bones . If he lives long enough in the desert , a man , like other animals , can learn to smell water . Learn , at least , the smell of things associated with water ? the odor of the cottonwood tree , for example , which out here might well be called the tree of life . In this wilderness of naked rock , there is no vision more pleasing than the acidgreen leaves of this venerable tree , signifying not only water but shade . The cottonwood means water , but @#  | it may be too far underground to be of any use . If you have what is called a survival problem and try to dig for this water during the heat of the day the effort may cost you more in sweat than you will find to drink , for it is difficult to satisfy your thirst with moist sand . I have tried it . Better to wait for nightfall when the cottonwood trees and other plants along the wash seem to release some of the water they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to the surface of the sand . If it does not , you are then welcome to march onward until sooner or later you find a spring or at least a seep on the canyon wall . On the other hand , you might not . The desert is a land of surprises , some of which are terrible . Terrible as derived from terror . When out for a walk bring your own water ? not less than a gallon a day . More surprises . In places you will find clear , flowing streams , as in the Salt Wash of the Arches , where the water looks beautifully drinkable but is too saline to swallow . You might think , dying of thirst , that any water however salty would be better than none at all , but this is not true . Small doses will not keep you alive , and a deep drink will force your body to expend water in getting rid of the excess salt , with the result a net loss of body moisture and a hastening of dehydration . Dehydration first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , your own or a coimpanion 's , a substitute for water ; blood is too salty . The same is true of urine . If it 's your automobile which has failed you , you 'd be better off tapping the radiator . If this resource is not available and water can not be found in the rocks or sand and you find yourself too tired an discouraged to go on , crawl in the shade and wait for help . If no one is looking for you , write your will in the sand and let the wind carry your last words east to the borders of Colorado and south to the mountains of the moon . Someday , never fear , your bare , elegant bones will be discovered and marveled at . Drink It All . A great thirst is a great joy when assuaged in time . On my first walk down into Havasu Canyon , which is a small hidden branch of the Grand Canyon , never mind exactly where , I took with me only a one-quart canteen , thinking that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August . On the rim of the canyon the temperature was a tolerable 96 degrees , but it rose about degree for each mile down and forward . Like a fool I rationed water , drank sparingly , and could have died of sunstroke . When late in the afternoon I finally stumbled ? sun-dazed , blear-eyed , parched an old bacon rind ? upon that blue stream which flows like a mirage  | across the canyon floor , I was too exhausted to pause and drink soberly from the bank . Dreamily , deliriously , I slogged into the waist-deep water and fell on my face . Like a sponge I soaked up moisture through every pore , letting the current bear me along beneath a canopy of willow trees . I had no fear of drowning in the water ? I intended to drink it all . Other surprises . Northeast of Moab , Utah , in a region of gargoyles and hobgoblins , a landscape left over from the late Jurassic period , is peculiar little waterhole named Onion Spring . A few wild onions row in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden princess plume , an indicator of selenium , a mild poison often found in association with uranium , a poison not so mild . In addition to the selenium , the water of Onion Spring contains arsenic . Taste it , see for yourself . What else is odd about this little ring , where no one ever comes except the odd few who want to see what a sick spring looks like ? Well , the water is too clear . There 's no life in it . No bugs . When in doubt about drinking from an unknown ring , look for life . If the water is scummy with algae , crawling with worms , tadpoles , flukes and scales , reassured , drink hearty , you 'll get nothing worse than dysentery . But if it appears innocent and pure , beware . There are rumors that when dying - of thirst you can save soul and body by extracting water from the barrel cactus . This is a dubious proposition . It might be possible in the low desert of Arizona where the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big around as a beer keg . But in Utah a similar species grows no more than a foot up and bristles with needles curved like fishhooks . To even get close you need leather gloves and a machete . Slice off the top and you find inside not a little tun of precious water but only the green pulpy core of the living plant . To get a few drops of liquid from that you would have to hack the cactus into manageable chunks and wring what water you could from each piece . Meanwhile , you are sweating badly from the labor and the exasperation , dehydrating rapidly , doomed anyway . You 'd be better off to stay at home with the TV and a case of beer . If this happy thought arrives too late , relax and enjoy your demise as best you can ; it 's the only one you are likely to know . The Sound of Thunder . In July and August , here on the high desert , come the thunderstorms . The mornings begin clear and dazzling bright , the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trace of cloud from the Book Cliffs on the north to the Blue Mountains So miles to the south , from the Sierra La Sal on the east to the notched reef of the San Rafael 100 miles west . By noon , though , clouds are beginning to form over the mountains , coming it seems out of nowhere , out of nothing , a special creation . They merge 64 THE READER 'S DIGEST February , and multiply , cumuli nimbi piling up like whipped cream , like mashed potatoes , building upon one another into a second mountain range greater than the terrestrial range below . The massive forms jostle and grate , ions collide , and the sound of thunder is heard on the sundrenched land . At my observation point on a sandstone monolith , the sun is blazing down as intensely as ever , the air crackling with dry heat . But the storm clouds are taking over the sky and , as they approach , the battle breaks out . Lightning streaks among the clouds like gunfire ; volleys of thunder shake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another no rain falls , but now they begin bombarding the ridgetops and buttes below . Forks of lightning , like illuminated nerves , link heaven and earth . The wind is rising and , for anyone with sense enough to get out of the rain , now is the time to seek shelter . Above me the clouds roll in , smoking billows in malignant violet , dense as wool . Most of the sky is lidded over , but the sun remains clear , halfway down the west , shining beneath the storm . Over my head the clouds thicken , then crack and split with a roar like that of cannonballs tumbling down a marble staircase ; their bellies open ? too late to run now ! ? and suddenly the rain comes down . Comes down : not softly , not gently , with no quality of mercy , but like heavy water in buckets , raindrops like lead pellets smashing and splattering on the flat rock , knock ing the berries off the juniper . plastering my shirt to my back , drumming on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brim . The pinnacles and arches of sandstone , glazed with water still exposed to the sun , gleam Iike old gray silver in the holy ? no , unholy ? light that slants in under the black ceiling of the storm . For five minutes the deluge continues , then trails off quickly diminishes to a shower , to nothing ' while the clouds , moving off , rumble in the distance . A fresh gold light breaks through and now , the east , a double rainbow appears with one foot in the canyon of Colorado and the other far north the Salt Wash Valley . The desert storm is over and through the sweet , pellucid air the cliff swallows the nighthawks plunge and swerve with cries of hunger and war and ? who knows ? ? perhaps of exultation as well . Burden on the Wind . After the storm has passed and the stream are as dry as they were before , water still remains in natural cisterns potholes carved by wind and weather into rimrock , canyon bench mesa top . Some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending upon the depth and exposure to the sun . Often far from any spring or stream these temporary pools attract doves , ravens and other birds for so long as they last , provide the deer and the THE WEST 'S LAND OF SURPRISES 65 coyotes with a short-lived water supply ; you too , if you know where to look , may slake your thirst there , d fill your canteens . The rainpools , set in monolithic rock , are usually devoid of plant life but not always of animal life . They may contain certain amphibians such as the spadefoot toad , which is in the sediment in the bottom the pothole . When rain comes , he emerges from the mud , singing madly , mates with the nearest female , and fills the pool with a swarm of tadpoles , most of them doomed to an ephemeral existence . With luck a few may survive to become mature toads , and as the pool dries up they , like their parents , make themselves a burrow in the mud , , which they seal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait down there , week after week , patiently , hopefully , infinitely , for the next rain . If it comes soon , the cycle can be repeated ; if not , the colony is reduced to dust , a burden on the wind . Singing for Joy . A strange and stirring sight , to come on a pool at night , after a little rain , and see the toads and frogs clinging to the edges their temporary pond , bodies immersed in the water but heads in the air , all of them croaking away in tricky counterpoint . Why do they sing so joyfully ? They are not hunting or fighting or mating with each other ; they are not moving about in search of love . Since the zoologist has no good explanation , I 'll settle the answer implied in the question : they are singing for joy , for joy in the coolness and wetness after weeks of desert heat , for joy in their music , for joy in life , however brief that life may turn out to be . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It certainly does . Behold the jolly toads belching musically in their slimy , shrinking , sun-doomed home . Meanwhile rattlesnakes and whipsnakes , attracted by the uproar , are gliding close in quest of supper ; some of the musical amphibians will continue their metamorphosis via the nerves and tissues of a reptile , in which process the joy of the toad is transmuted into the contentment of the snake . Perhaps nothing is lost , then , except the individual consciousness , which some philosophers maintain is only an illusion anyway . Water , water ? there really is no shortage of water in the desert . There is , in fact , exactly the right amount , a perfect ratio of water to rock , insuring a decent , habitable spacing among plants and animals , and human inhabitants also . Even so , only the boldest of travelers , seeking visions , will stay for long in the strange country of the standing rock , where the spadefoot toads bellow madly on the edge of a rainpool , where the arsenic spring awaits the thirst-crazed traveler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet deer walk at evening up glens of sandstone through tamarisk and sage toward hidden springs of sweet , cool , still , clear , unfailing water .
