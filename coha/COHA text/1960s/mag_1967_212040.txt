" You feel like an ant on a dart board , " says a young U.S. Marine at Gio Linh , the American artillery base carved out of the top of a hill overlooking North Viet Nam ( see color opposite ) . The camp 's main gate bids a black-humor welcome to " the Alamo of Viet Nam . " Like neighboring Con Thien to the west , Gio Linh is the merest outstretched fingertip of the U.S. presence in Viet Nam , an isolated and vulnerable outpost less than two miles from the Demilitarized Zone . It lies in a no man 's land that has become the bitterest battleground of the war , an arena of combat unique in Viet Nam for its rigors and relentlessness . <P> Along the DMZ there is no need to hunt for the enemy ; he is all around , waiting for an opportunity to strike an unwary patrol , a lumbering convoy or one of the camps itself . The Marines mostly sit and wait , cramped in muddy bunkers and trenches . Day and night their 105-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DMZ and into North Viet Nam beyond to interdict the Communist buildup and southward movement ; day and night the dread cry of " Incoming ! " rings through the camps as the Communists return the shells . It is a deadly duel of giant cannon more akin to World War I or Korea than to the rest of the war in Viet Nam , and it has long since potholed the rolling scrub hills and emerald paddies for miles around . <P> <P> Rain of Shells . Con Thien 's lifeline is a four-mile-long road connecting the camp with Landing Zone C2 , where its supplies are brought in by air . Last week a Marine battalion providing security for the road was attacked by two battalions of North Viet Nam 's 324-B Division-part of some 30,000 Red regulars operating in an area defended by 6,000 Marines . Nearly 100 mortar and rocket shells rained down on the leathernecks . Then , recalls Platoon Sergeant John E. Lewis , 22 , " the enemy came across the paddies in waves like a herd of turtles . " The battle raged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought at times hand to hand , F-4 Phantoms dropped napalm on the attackers . When the North Vietnamese finally broke off the battle and crept across the DMZ into the darkness , they left 140 dead behind . The Marines took 34 killed and 185 wounded . <P> Three days later the Communists attacked Con Thien itself , and a North Vietnamese company followed a heavy artillery and mortar barrage right up to the camp 's wire . Repulsed , the Communists withdrew after half an hour , but four Marines were killed and 15 wounded defending the camp perimeter . And all week long , the shells rained down as usual on the Marines . One attack of 80 rounds of 82-mm. mortar fire killed four and wounded 93 . Another of rocket and artillery fire killed nine Marines and wounded 31 . <P> When Hardcore Whines . The rhythm of life in the Marine camps is controlled by the constant threat of the
