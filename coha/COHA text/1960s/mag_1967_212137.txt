The Vienna Philharmonic is 125 years old this year , and so is the . New York Philharmonic . Last week at Man hattan 's Philharmonic Hall , the festivities merged as New York began its fall season by vacating the stage to the Viennese . In the Green Room at intermis sion , New York 's Leonard Bernstein ( who guest-conducted Beethoven 's Leonora Overture No. 3 at the concert ) embraced Vienna 's Karl Bohm and wondered aloud whether the two orches tras might not be brother or sister . <P> If they are , the family resemblance is faint . Although the Vienna Philharmonic responded to Bernstein 's exuberant beat with a reasonable facsimile of the razor-sharp New York sound , it played for Bohm with the familiar tone that has made it one of the outstanding groups in orchestral history . <P> The Vienna Philharmonic sound is that of an idealized chamber ensemble , a creamy , homogeneous , pliant blend of wind , brass and string tone that hovers in the air . Trumpeter Helmut Wobisch , the orchestra 's manager , ascribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brass instruments , wider in bore than those used in Ameri can , French and British ensembles , and handmade of exceptionally thin metal , producing a blendable tone without the usual cutting edge . <P> But an even better explanation for the Viennese sound probably lies in Vienna itself and its justifiable smugness where music is concerned . " Our grandfathers played for Beethoven and Brahms , " explains Concertmaster ( one of four ) and Philharmonic President Walter Barylli , " and they passed this knowledge on to us . We know how they should be played . " <P> To maintain its pipeline to the immortals , the orchestra employs only Austrians . Its members ' built-in self-assur ance serves a dual function . On the one hand , this guarantees a standard of performance for which the men themselves will fight , no matter who is on the podium . On the other , it can create a special kind of psychological hell for whoever dares to mount that podium . <P> Democratic Anarchy . Not surprisingly , the orchestra runs itself , choosing its managerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or off the podium at will . It has 154 playing personnel , all of whom are actually employed by the Austrian government as musicians for the Vienna State Opera . They decide among themselves which members are to get together in their so-called spare time to give ten pairs of concerts as the Vienna Philharmonic , and which will make up the opera orchestra on which nights . This kind of shifting personnel might seem like a mindless way to run an orchestra , but the saving grace in Vienna is the philosophy that the Philharmonic way of life is larger than life itself .
