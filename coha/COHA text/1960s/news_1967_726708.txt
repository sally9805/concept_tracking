Hart 's return came on the eve of the publication in a suburban newspaper of an advertisement by Mrs. Hart offering $10,000 reward for information leading to his whereabouts . Curbed Near School Hart told Schaller and Detective Mitchell that when he left the First National Bank . of Blue Island , wherehe tried to cash the two $25,000 bonds , he got into his car and was driving in Division street when two men in a car curbed his auto near St. Donatus Catholic church at 130th and Division streets .

The car was driven around for what Hart estimated at about 20 or 30 minutes and finally stopped at a two-flat building . Hart said he believes the building is near Harvey . He said it is near a railroad , and he heard the sound of construction going on in the neighborhood . Schaller said Hart could give no reason for his belief the building was near Harvey . Hart said he was kept in a second floor room which had no window , but which had an adjoining bathroom , also without a window . He said he never saw the faces of the men except for the brief glimpse he got of them when he got out of his car .

This included a demand for $25,000 , which Schaller took to a prearranged site in Chicago but which no one showed up to claim . Hart reported that during his captivity he had not been given any newspapers or magazines or heard any radio or television reports . Schaller said Hart had no idea how long he had been held and appeared amazed that it was almost four weeks .
