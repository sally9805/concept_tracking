Youngsters roll on the ground , tussling , teasing each other and gleefully aping their elders . They climb the tropical trees with abandon and plunge happily into cooling water-holding their noses when they dunk . Despite the similarities , the equatorial playground , at the edge of a 12,000-acre forest preserve on Borneo is no boys ' camp . It is the Malaysian state of Sabah 's experimental center for the rehabilitation of orangutans . <P> The orangutan-Malay for " man of the forest " - is badly in need of a helping hand . Once these big red-haired primates ( an adult male stands about 5 ft. tall , weighs 150 lbs. ) inhabited the jungles of Borneo and Sumatra by the tens of thousands . Today , only 6,000 or so are left . Spreading farms and logging operations have driven the survivors ever deeper into the rain forest ; native hunters shoot the mothers and carry off the young orangutans for illegal sale to foreign zoos ( price : as much as $4,000 apiece ) . To save this vanishing Asian cousin of Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orangutans from poachers and trying to retrain them for the wild . <P> Civilized Taste . It is no simple matter . Like human babies , the orangs are prone to disease , require fussy diets and demand constant coddling . " They pull your ears affectionately , " says Sabah Conservator of Forests Thomas Bayles , " and they go to bed hugging each other . " Worse yet , they take all too eagerly to the comforts of domestication , quickly develop a fondness for such civilized delicacies as salt , pineapples and chicken eggs . Despite efforts to toughen them up by letting them run loose , the adolescent orangs swing down from their treetop nests when it rains and sleep in their dry cages . <P> When they are finally strong enough to stray from the clearing occasionally , Ranger James Wong and his staff carry them deep into the forest , abandoning them there along with a day 's supply of food . But the orangs usually come scrambling home shortly after the food is gone . A few days later , Wong hauls them off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the orangs stubbornly refuse to give up the easy living with their human friends . <P> Still , Wong 's jungle boot camp has been a partial success . So far , eight " graduates " have not reappeared in months ; yet some orangs , like a young female named Joan , seem unable to make up their minds . She mated in the wild but came back to have her baby . Now she wanders in and out of the camp with little Joan clinging to her side , enjoying the best of both worlds .
