THE PRESIDENCY <P> Before his death , President Kennedy had held several political strategy sessions , made it clear that he meant to base his 1964 campaign on a peace-and-prosperity pitch . Now Kennedy 's successor intends to do the same thing-but with his own L.B.J. brand . That much was evident as he returned to Washington this week to deliver his first State of the Union address . <P> Last week , while still at his Texas ranch , President Johnson declared that this will be the year of an American " peace offensive , " and he launched it while playing host to Germany 's Chancellor Ludwig Erhard . <P> Erhard was enchanted by all the Texas trimmings-including the gift of a ten-gallon hat and a choral rendition of Tief in dem Herzen von Texas . But he was even more taken with Johnson himself . During an hourlong , deer-spotting drive through the countryside , the President confided that he had not been aware before Nov. 22 of the immense pressures involved in formulating the budget , in trying to conserve money while maintaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wanted to do what was right , but even so were growing weary of the burden of foreign aid and of keeping their armies in Europe . Erhard was impressed . That night at dinner , he said to the President : " What you told me this afternoon during our drive through the country-this has given me food for thought . " <P> " The Truth I Feel . " Lyndon provided some tougher food for Erhard to chew over . " The President , " reported an aide who sat in on the talks , " said things that needed saying . " Johnson bluntly told Erhard that he did not want to hear any lectures on the dangers of Communism , that Americans are fully as aware of the dangers as the West Germans . He reminded Erhard of the cries of anguish from West Germany every time the U.S. even mentions the possibility of talks with the Soviets on the Berlin question . He urged Erhard to re-examine the problems of reunification and to come up with some suggestions of his own . <P> The German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adenauer era , when every American gesture toward relaxing cold war tensions was interpreted as a sellout of West Germany . Erhard understood the U.S. frustrations and seemed determined to make his country bear its full share as a partner in the Western Alliance . And he readily agreed with Johnson that West Germany itself ought to join in the search for new paths toward East-West agreements . <P> Erhard showed with genuine feeling that he had established a personal friendship with the President , and he was obviously moved when he made his farewell . " Together , " he said , " we need not be afraid of this world : together we are strong enough to preserve peace and freedom and justice all over the world . All these questions were discussed in detail and we have been able to state full agreement and full unity of views . This is not just a diplomatic statement ; it is just the truth I feel .
