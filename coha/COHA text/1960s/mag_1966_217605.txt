From its headquarters in a converted yeast factory in New York 's Greenwich Village , the staff of Bank Street College of Education views the nation 's scholas tic trends with a certain justifiable smugness . Bank Street itself has for many years been a yeasty factor in one of U.S. education 's newest preoccupations : the preschool teaching of young children . Now observing its 50th anniversary , the college suddenly finds its expertise in great demand . <P> The massive federally financed " Head Start " program , like many other current teaching interests , is old stuff to Bank Street , which began as a laboratory school to study the teaching of children who had to meet only one requirement : to be able to walk . Some of the pupils even wore diapers . Bank Street , foreshadowing another practice , a decade ago added classes for the mothers of its nursery-school pupils to help them help their children . On the basis of its reputation as " the mother of early childhood education , " it has just been selected by the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers evaluating the Head Start programs . <P> Dirty Hands . Bank Street was one of the first teachers colleges to accent the special problems of urban schools , and it did so by plunging into on-the-spot work in New York 's poorest neighborhoods . Says a Columbia Teachers College professor : " Bank Street was willing to go down and dirty its hands in the New York City schools at a time when Columbia and New York University would n't be caught dead there . " The Bank Street staff now advises teachers in 24 Harlem area schools under foundation contracts . <P> <P> Ever since it began training teachers , Bank Street has shunned " how to teach " courses , insisted that , as Vice President Charlotte Winsor explains , " the first step in learning to be a teacher is learning how to learn . " On that principle , the school accepts only graduate students who already hold liberal arts degrees from other colleges . It throws its students immediately into practice teaching in the public schools , emphasizes individual instruction , and hopes that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass-production matter . " We try to do unto teachers as we hope they will do unto their children , " says Mrs. Winsor . <P> Integrated Textbooks . In the wave of curriculum reform now sweeping the public schools , the techniques of helping children to " discover " truths and relationships is of central importance . Lucy Sprague Mitchell , a John Dewey disciple who founded the school and ran it until her retirement in 1956 , knew all about the discovery method many years ago . She had all the school 's heating pipes painted red and all the water-pipes blue . Then , when the children asked why , she let them follow the colors to the furnace and water main . <P>
