THE LOST CITY by John Gunther. 594 pages . Harper &; Row . $5.95 . <P> <P> For a brash young Chicago Daily News correspondent named John Gunther , Vienna in the early ' 30s was about the most exciting assignment on earth . The city was charmed and doomed , as elegant , perverse and scandal loving as an aging archduchess . Though tiny post-Versailles Austria ( pop . 6,760,000 ) teetered perennially on the edge of bankruptcy , the ancient Hapsburg capital was still the political and financial nerve center of the Balkans . As Europe slid into the chaos of depression and approaching war , the Viennese reveled in the musicmaking of Richard Strauss , Lotte Lehman and Bruno Walter ; they entrusted their psyches to Sigmund Freud and his rivals , and indefatigably dissected Stefan Zweig 's novels or Joseph Schumpeter 's economics in the city 's celebrated cafs , fueling the endless talkfest with the best beer and coffee in the world . <P> <P> Golden Age . For Gunther , who arrived there in 1930 , it also meant some pretty fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Vincent Sheean , William L. Shirer , the New York Evening Post 's roving Dorothy Thompson and its resident Balkanologist M. W. ( " Mike " ) Fodor , I.N.S. 's H. R. Knickerbocker , the Chicago Daily News 's Negley Farson-and many other now-legendary figures-were Gunther 's cablehead competitors and constant caf companions . Together , they zestfully created the profession and the mystique of the U.S. foreign correspondent , and built the by-lined reputations that made that era a golden age of American reporting from abroad . Now , three decades and two dozen books later , Gunther returns to those glamorous years in nostalgic fiction . It is an Inside job . <P> The hero of the novel answers to the name of Mason Jarrett , but he strongly resembles guntherized Gunther . A rumpled bear of a man , working for a Chicago paper , he covers all southeastern Europe from Istanbul to Prague . Jarrett also has Gunther 's herculean capacity for hard work , his shrewd journalistic intuition , the same flair for intimate background stories about nations and their leaders ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1931 attempt to form a customs union with Germany to its four-day civil war in February 1934 , when the fascist Heitnwehr militia crushed the socialists . Despite Gunther 's insistence that all his characters are imaginary , readers are sure to be chewing for some time over the strong resemblances between Mason Jarrett 's colleagues and Gunther 's own . What is clearly not at all fictional is the authentic flavor and loving detail of the city , the times , and the correspondent 's life . <P> Shoveled Cream . If Gunther had left it at that , his book would be a fascinating fictionalized reminiscence . Unfortunately , he succumbs to the Viennese weakness for whipped cream , mountains of it , wherever possible . After a connubial kiss on page 20- " Bending over and with his hand cupped like a trowel he lifted her chin " - Jarrett 's hand more often resembles a shovel . His amatory adventures are mawkish , his professional exploits downright unbelievable : before the book 's end he has even manned a machine gun to help fight off the Heimwehr.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
