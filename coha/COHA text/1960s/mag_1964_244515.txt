Little more than ten years has passed since two psychiatrists first gave North American patients the new drugs that were soon to be widely known as tranquilizers . In so doing , they started the most dramatic and hopeful revolution in the long , dolorous history of mental illness . They are still at it . Berlin-born Dr. Heinz Edgar Lehmann , who introduced chlorpromazine at Verdun Protestant Hospital outside Montreal , is barnstorming at meetings called to find ways of developing still more and better drugs . New York 's Dr. Nathan S. Kline , who introduced reserpine at Rockland State Hospital , is in Iran , fomenting a psychiatric revolution there . Just before he left the U.S. , Dr. Kline told the New York Academy of Medicine what has been wrought in these ten years . It is impressive indeed . <P> Savings in Billions . Most notable , of course , has been the reversal of a once seemingly inevitable annual increase in the number of mental patients . If their numbers had continued to mount since 1956-when use of the drugs became widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , there would now be 82,000 more patients confined in mental hospitals . " Instead , " said Dr. Kline , " there has been an actual decrease of 54,000 patients , giving a difference of 136,000 persons . " The care of these might-have-been patients over eight years would have cost more than $1 billion , Dr. Kline estimates ; building hospitals to house the newcomers would have cost $2 billion more . Alongside such figures , the cost of the drugs and of drug research is " very modest indeed . " <P> Anybody admitted to a mental hospital today has twice as good a chance of getting out as he would have had before the drugs . Therefore , said Dr. Kline : " Public-mental-hospital patients now come with an expectation of improvement , and they come earlier-when treatment is more apt to be successful . " <P> Accepted as Illness . The drug revolution , said Dr. Kline , has opened up broad new avenues for the treatment of many patients formerly considered untreatable . Most important , perhaps , " it has begun to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kline pointed out that today there is much " greater acceptance of patients back into the community , since psychiatric disorders are now much more-looked upon as illnesses , and as illnesses that can be treated . The fact that a condition is treated with medication somehow guarantees , in the public mind , that it is a genuine illness . " One measure of this change is that one-third ( by his estimate ) of all packages passing across druggists ' prescription counters today are for drugs that influence the mind .
