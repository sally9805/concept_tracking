When the Bolshoi Opera crossed the Atlantic last year to Montreal 's Expo 67 , it lugged along 95 choristers , 48 soloists , 99 instrumentalists , 50 dancers , 127 staff assistants , 193 tons of scenery and five tons of Russian edibles . When Rome 's Piccolo Teatro Musicale arrived in Manhattan last week , there was a little less to be seen-a handful of singers and players , one slightly overweight conductor , and a compact bundle of slats , screws and canvas that weighed scarcely more than a ton . But when the slats and canvas were screwed together into a miniature Neapolitan theater on the stage of Carnegie Hall , the audience found plenty to admire . <P> For though piccolo means small , the Piccolo Teatro Musicale stands for something very big in music today-a burgeoning interest in the baroque and post-baroque . Its leader , Renato Fasano , has played a pioneering role in bringing back Vivaldi and Corelli with his celebrated chamber ensemble Virtuosi di Roma . Now he is doing the same thing for the chamber operas of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York audience , nurtured in the Metropolitan Opera 's grand-opera tradition , found a welcome change in Fasano 's creation of an intimate , two-century-old court tradition . They chuckled when Italian Clown Sesto Bruscantini scored a solid single in Cimarosa 's 18-minute solo opera Il Maestro di Cappella , and then roared out loud as Bruscantini and Carlo Badioli , an even funnier man , rapped out a two-bass hit with the huffa-buffa La Cambiale di Matrimonio , Rossini 's first stage work . This week the troupe will pack the show on their backs for a brief tour of the U.S. and Canada , where audiences will no doubt agree that while in North America , it is perfectly acceptable for the Piccolo Teatro Musicale to continue to do as the Romans do .
