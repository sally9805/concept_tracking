. Then she took her mouth away and for several minutes pressed her lips lightly against his throat . " You 're not as scared as you were the first time I wanted to do this , " she said . It was true : Sonny did n't feel at all scared , though his legs were trembling just a little from excitement . He liked to feel Mrs. Popper 's lips moving against his throat . This had been the first time in his life when kissing someone had been as pleasant as he imagined kissing should be . It was never that pleasant with Charlene . " Maybe we 're going to have something , after all , " Ruth said . " Will you drive me to the hospital again next week , if I arrange for Herman to ask you ? " " You bet , " Sonny said . " The sooner the better , as far as I 'm concerned . " He bent down to find her mouth and Ruth put her hands on his cheeks again . They kissed slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one had been , but then Ruth discovered that Sonny had awakened and was thrusting at her , not so much with his mouth as with himself , wanting more of her . He kissed so hard her head was pushed back and when she opened her eyes for a moment she was looking straight up , toward the stars . Sonny tried to get even closer to her , pulling her against him with his arm . In years nothing had thrilled her so much or touched her so much as he did , simply by wanting her  --  the rush of her blood made her almost dizzy . She took his tongue into her mouth and touched it lightly for a second with her tongue and the edges of her teeth . Then she took her face away quickly , pressing it against his neck again . " I 'm going home now , " she said . " This is no place to dawdle . Tuesday we 'll do this more . I really want to do it more , do n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck . He did n't want to talk  --  what he wanted was more of thep101delicate , delicious sensations her mouth had given him . It seemed to him it might just be best if he said so . " I want to kiss you one more time before you go home , " he said . " Goodness , " Ruth said . " Okay . " She lifted her hand and traced the edges of his lips with one finger before she kissed him . Again , when they kissed , he pressed against her with an insistence that thrilled Ruth : it was if he were trying to find her very center , her deepest place . While they were kissing , a car turned into the other end of the parking lot and the lights arced in their direction . It was simply some teenagers turning around , but it scared them and they broke apart immediately . " In three days I 'll see you , " Ruth said , picking up the wastebasket . Sonny felt it would n't do for him to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered at the front door . When he came in Duane was standing by the coatroom , obviously furious . Leroy Malone and two or three other boys were standing there too . " I guess you heard the news , " Duane said . " My girl 's gone swimming naked with Lester Marlow . That 's about the damndest thing I ever heard . It 's enough to make a man go get drunk . " " I guess Mrs. Farrow forced her into it , " Sonny said . " Let 's go get drunk , " Leroy suggested . " I know where we can steal a couple of bottles of vodka  --  I saw a man put two in his car just a minute ago . " The suggestion had much appeal , and Sonny immediatelyseconded it . Getting drunk would be the only way to save Duane from a gloomy night , and besides he felt a good bit like getting drunk himself . Kissing Mrs. Popper had left him excited and confused . Leroy swiped the vodka and the three of them drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock on Saturday nights . A good many of the younger kids trailed up also , hoping to get a swallow or two of vodka . They all bought cokes and took them back to the john one at a time and spiked them . None of them were used to vodka and it was not long before it began to have an effect on their behavior , not to mention their pool shooting . They shot so badly that it took them thirty minutes to finish an eight-ball game . " Boys , from the way you all are shootin ' a feller would think you were drunk , " Sam the Lion said innocently , breaking them all up . Leroy Malone was very inventive when it came to pestering Billy , and when eight-ball began to get tiresome it occurred to him that it might be fun to get Billy drunk . He drew Sonny and Duane aside . " Let 's take Billy somewhere and get him drunk , " he said . " Think how funny he 'd be drunk . " The boys were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed Billy and waltzed him outside . Several of the younger boys got wind of the plot and tagged along . " We could go on down to the stockpens , " Leroy suggested . " There 's a blind heifer down there we could fuck . She belongs to my uncle . There 's enough of us we could hold her down . It 'd be as good a place as any to get Billy drunk . " The prospect of copulation with a blind heifer excitedthe younger boys almost to frenzy , but Duane and Sonny , being seniors , gave only tacit approval . They regardedsuch goings on without distaste , but were no longer as rabid about animals as they had been . Sensible youths , growing up in Thalia , soon learned to make do with what there was , and in the course of their adolescence both boys had frequently had recourse to bovine outlets . At that they were considered overfastidious by the farm youth ofp103the area , who thought only dandies restricted themselves to cows and heifers . The farm kids did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever else they could catch . There were reports that a boy from Scotland did it with domesticatedgeese , but no one had ever actually witnessed it . It was common knowledge that the reason boys from the dairy farming communities were so reluctant to come out for football was because it put them home too late for the milking and caused them to miss regular connection with the milk cows . Many of the town kids were also versatile and resourceful  --  theonly difficulty was that they had access to a smaller and less varied animal population . Even so , one spindly sophomore whose father sold insurance had once been surprised in ecstatic union with a roan cocker spaniel , and a degraded youth from the north side of town got so desperate one day that he crawled into a neighbor 's pig pen in broad daylight and did it with a sow . " I say a blind heifer beats nothing , " Leroy said , and no one actively disagreed with the sentiment . They all got in the pickup and headed for the stockpens , eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stockpens were a mile or two north of town , surrounded by mesquite . When they got there all the boys in the back piled out and went to locate the heifer , but Sonny and Duane stayed in the cab a minute and took a final drink of vodka to warm them up . They gave Billy a coke that was about a third full of vodka and he drank it happily . " We better slow him down , " Duane said . " If he gets too drunk he may want a turn at the heifer . I doubt old Hank Malone would want an idiot screwin ' his livestock . " Sonny got out , not saying anything . It bothered him when people called Billy an idiot . Billy did n't seem that much dumber than other people , and he was a lot friendlierthan most.  |p104When  they got to the lots Leroy was sitting on the fence watching the younger kids chasing the scared , sightlessheifer around the dark pen . " They 're after her , " he said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heifer did n't weigh over three hundred pounds and in a few minutes the boys cornered her by the loading chute and wrestled her to the ground . She struggledfor awhile but finally gave it up and lay still . A freshmanwas sitting on her head and her frightened breath raised little puffs of dust from the sandy lot . Sonny , Duane , and Leroy got off the fence and went over to watch . Billy had climbed up on the fence , but he did n't know what was going on and just sat there sucking the empty Coke bottle . " You boys are holding her wrong , " Leroy said in a superior tone . " Ai n't you ever fucked a heifer before ? You little piss-ants must be virgins . Let her up on her knees . " The younger boys thought that was bitter news : the heifer had been trouble enough to get down . Leroy was a senior , however , and they respected his authority . When they let her up she almost got away , but there were nine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had come time to decide who went first , and the younger boys , nearing exhaustion just from holding the heifer , pressed for a decision . It would be one of the three seniors , of course . " You all decide , " one of them pleaded . " We ca n't hold her all night . " At that point Sonny surprised everyone , even himself , by suddenly withdrawing from the competition . " You all help yourselves , " he said hastily . " I drunk too much , I think I 'm gon na have to puke . " It was the best excuse he could think of . When he agreed to come to the stockpens he supposed he wouldp105naturally be a participant , but the moment he saw the little blind heifer he knew he did n't want to . It had something to do with Mrs. Popper , though he was not certain just what . It did n't seem right to kiss Mrs. Popper and still fiddle around with heifers , blind or not blind . Not only did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kissing Mrs. Popper even once was bound to be more fun than anything he could possibly do with the skinny , quivering little heifer . He suddenly felt like he had graduated , and it was an uneasy feeling . He knew Duane and the other boys would think it awfully strange of him not to take a turn , so to fool them he went off in the mesquites and pretended to be sick . When he came back to the fence the orgy in the lot was in full progress . Duane was attacking the heifer , and Leroy , who had already finished , was helping hold . Two or three of the younger boys had their pants down and were parading lustfully around the lot . One sophomore was in something of a predicament because , by an unexpectedstroke of luck , he had actually made out with a girl that night , a pig from Holliday who had come to the dance . As a consequence of that success the boy was feeling somewhat enervated and was attempting to restore himself by beating his member against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heifer it was even more hilarious : many of them were too short to reach the target comfortably and had to struggle on tiptoe . Then in the midst of it all the heifer finally broke loose and went dashing across the lot with one of the freshmen hanging furiously to her tail . Sonny was just as glad . Somehow it was n't as exciting as it had been when he was a freshman . " Look at of Billy takin ' that in , " Leroy said . " What we ought to do is buy him a piece . We could get the carhopfor a dollar , if it was just Billy . " " Hell , if she 's that cheap we ought to gone to herp106ourselves , " Duane said . " I heard she was a five-dollar whore . " " Naw , " Leroy said . " Anybody with five dollars can do better than Jimmie Sue . That heifer 's got prettier legs than she has . She 'd be okay for Billy , though . I 've heard that idiots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit around and let Billy die a virgin . " " I do n't know if we ought to try anything like that , " Sonny said . " What if it upset Billy and Sam the Lion found out about it ? I 'd just as soon not get crosswise with Sam . " " Aw do n't be a chickenshit , Crawford , " Leroy said . " It might do Billy good to get a little . " " Not if he gets it from Jimmie Sue it would n't , " Sonny said , very ill at ease . " You do n't have to chip in if you 're so stingy , " Duane said . " Let 's go on and get her . " Sonny quit arguing  --  he really did n't know how to argue against a whole crowd . He never had even wanted to before . They piled back in the pickup and he drove to the back entrance of the town 's one little hotel . Leroy and Duane went up to make arrangements with Jimmie Sue Jones , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy , who was still sucking on the empty Coke bottle . It was almost the first time in Sonny 's life that he had not been willing to go on and do whatever the crowd was doing . Before , it had always seemed like fun , whether it was getting drunk or screwing heifers , but he did n't think it would be any fun at all to make Billy do it with Jimmie Sue . Billy was in a perfectly peaceful mood , sucking on the bottle and glad to be along with all the boys , and it seemed a pity to disturb him . In a minute the boys came out with Jimmie Sue , who was a sort of drive-in version of Penny , only dirtier . She had been car-hopping in Thalia for nine years and everyone in town was tired of her . She had been marriedp107once , to a mechanic with rat-tail sideburns , but he soon left her and went back to Bossier City , Louisiana , where he came from . The drive-in paid Jimmie Sue next to nothing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself when she could to make ends meet . She dyed her hair red and had no eyebrows except those she painted on in the morning , and she was so absentminded that sometimesshe only painted on one eyebrow and went around like that all day . For Billy she did n't bother to paint on even one . When she got in the cab it immediately began to smell so oniony that Sonny had to roll his windows down . Jimmie Sue looked at Billy disgustedly . " Why that thing 's just a kid , " she said . " You all ought n't to woke me up for a thing like that . I ought to get at least two dollars . " " Hell no , you said a dollar and a half , " Duane remindedher . " Well , I 'd just as soon it was an idiot as not , " Jimmie Sue said , unpeeling a stick of chewing gum . " The only thing I draw the line at is Mixicans and niggers . I guess I told you about the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bus station , that time I went to Los Angeles .... " It had been Jimmie Sue 's one adventure . She saved her money and went to Los Angeles to work , but the very hour she arrived in the Los Angeles bus station a black man wearing high heels stole her suitcase and all her possessions . Jimmie Sue had never been so disappointed in all her life as she was with Los Angeles . She could n't get a job and had to turn around and hitchhike back to Thalia , to keep from starving . Hitchhiking across the desert without any eyebrows proved a slow business , too . If it had n't been for a carfull of horny Mexicans she never would have got out of Needles , California , and bad as that was , Lordsburg , New Mexico was worse . Tired of eating dust , she let a Negro pick her up . By the time she gotp108back to Thalia she had nothing good to say about minority groups . Billy looked at her with mild curiosity , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab . Sonny drove back over the narrow , one-vehicle road that cut through the mesquite to the stockpens . " You all just get that thing out while I get ready , " Jimmie Sue said . " This ai n't the ideal dressin ' room . " Billy was happy to get out : he wondered if they were going to sit on the fence and watch the boys chase the cow again . To his surprise , no sooner was he out than six or seven of the boys grabbed him and unceremoniously threw him down on the cold hard ground . They took off his shoes , pants , and underwear . Groups of boys were alwaystaking his pants off , and that alone would n't have bothered him . It was having them off so late at night and at the stockpens that puzzled him . Also his legs were cold . " All right , " Jimmie Sue said . " Let the stupid little thing in . " " Wait a minute , " Duane said . " There 's a flashlight there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . " He got the flashlight and flashed it over Jimmie Sue , who was laying back in the pickup seat , as spraddle-legged as the narrow pickup would permit her to be . All the boys looked , and for a moment , paused in amazement . None of them had realized quite how fat Jimmy Sue was until the flashlight played over her huge hams and flabby stomach ; nor had they considered how unappetizing the female anatomy could be when presented in its most unappealinglight . They were all quiet for a moment , staring . It was only after they had looked for a while that they began to feel a little stirred up . Jimmie Sue was so ugly it was almost exciting  --  it was as if they were finally being shown the nasty things parents and preachers had alwaysp109whispered about . It was n't exactly what they had expected , because they persisted in thinking about it in terms of pretty girls , movie stars like Elizabeth Taylor , but it was precisely what they had been taught to expect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shove that thing in here with me , " Jimmie Sue said . " I never hired out for no peep show . " The boys shoved Billy in , more or less between Jimmie Sue 's legs , and tried to shut the door . They could n't get it completely shut but there were so many of them there was not much chance it would come open . Billy grunted with surprise and tried to back out , but he was trapped . " Why this is the dumbest thing I ever saw , " Jimmie Sue said . " It do n't even know what to do . " The boys flashed the light long enough to see that Jimmie Sue had managed to catch Billy with her legs , but she yelled at them to turn it off and they did . Apparently Billy got close enough to the object of it all that he caught on , because he stopped pushing backward and in a moment the pickup began to rock a little from side to side . Everybody yelled encouragement . " Quit that yellin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said irritably . " He ai n't in . " The flashlight was brought into play again and it was discovered that Billy , cramped as he was , had completely missed his natural target and was poking energetically at a deep wrinkle in the folds of Jimmie Sue 's stomach . Duane and Leroy laughed until they could barely stand up , but the younger kids were more fascinated than amused . None of them had ever seen so strange a sight , and they made no effort to correct Billy 's aim . Jimmie Sue was getting madder by the minute . Sonny stood by the rear end of the pickup , determinednot to look . It was n't that he thought Billy wouldp110mind him looking  --  it was just that he did n't really want to look . Jimmie Sue was uglier than Charlene , and the pickup would smell like onions for weeks . " Why goddamn you , you little thing ! " Jimmie Sue yelled furiously . " Now look what a mess you made ! " Sonny knew from the tone of her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hurried around to the door . The boys still had the flashlight on and were cackling and giggling : Billy had reached the end of his journey while still in the wrinkle , and Jimmie Sue was pounding at his face , trying to back him out of the pickup . Sonny managed to scatter the crowd enough to get the door open and help Billy out , but calming him down was something else . He was scared and confused and shivering , and Jimmie Sue had bloodied his nose . Sonny ' helped him get dressed and even found the empty Coke bottle for him , but Billy no longer wanted it . " Well , now I know idiots is just as bad as Mixicans , " Jimmie Sue said . " Do n't you wake me up for that crazy thing no more . I would n't mess with him agin for less than three-and-a-half . " By the time they got back to the poolhall the front of Billy 's shirt was all covered with blood . Sonny could n't get the nosebleed completely stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious , and he did n't blame him : it was no way to treat Billy . He wished he had known how to stop the whole business , but the only possible way would have been to offer to fight if they did n't let Billy alone , and he could n't very well offer to fight when his own best buddy was one of the crowd . If Lester and Jacy had n't run off to the swimming party none of it would have ever happened . As soon as the pickup stopped Billy jumped out and ran in the poolhall . It was officially closed , but they could all see Sam the Lion inside , reading a newspaper he had spread out on one of the tables . All he was really doingp111was waiting for Billy to come in . They lived in a plain little three-room apartment above the poolhall , and Sam never went to bed until Billy was in safe . Billy ran right on past him , up the stairs , and Sam left his paper and followed him . The boys waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episode in such a way that Sam the Lion would see the humor in it . Sonny knew they could n't and waited miserably for Sam to come down , but the boys who thought they might strutted around on the sidewalk talking with great bravado . Duane was sleepy and lay down in the cab of the pickup and went to sleep . The boys could have left , but none of them really wanted to go home until Sam the Lion came down and bawled them out . His bawling them out would relieve their minds of whatever minor guilt feelings they had about Billy , and would leave them free to enjoy the celebrity of having participated in such an event . Finally the light went out in the upstairs apartment and Sam the Lion came down . He opened the door and stood quietly a minute , looking at the boys . Sam the Lion was not the type who yelled and cussed about the pranks boys pulled . They could not see his face , but the light from the poolhall touched his white mane of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , after a minute . Sonny had them , and it put him on a terrible spot . He had been so anxious to get Billy back in his pants that he had forgotten to put the underwear on him  --  he picked them up later and stuffed them in his pocket . For a moment he was tempted to say nothing and pretend the underwear was lost  --  if he pulled them out and handed them over it would make him seem more of a participant than he had been . Sam did n't withdraw the question and the other boys began to look at Sonny nervously , so he took the underwear out of his pocket and awkwardly handed them over.  | " When I was helpin ' get his pants on I could n't find them , " he said . " I just forgot to hand them to him . " " Who went and bloodied his nose ? " " Jimmie Sue Jones , " Leroy said . " We thought he was getting tired of being a virgin so we chipped in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ' and gave him that nosebleed . " " Jimmie Sue ? " Sam said , startled . " You what ? " He had supposed it was just a simple case of the boys taking Billy 's pants off , something that happened all the time . When he realized what Leroy said he was stunned , and sat down in the doorway of the poolhall . Sonny became really worried . " Is Billy all right ? " he asked . " We 're sorry , Sam . " " He went to sleep , " Sam said , a little absently . " Did he want to go with Jimmie Sue ? " " Not hardly , " Leroy said . " He did n't even know what he was supposed to do . " Sam scratched his ankles for a minute and then stood up again . He did n't look particularly mad , just tired and discouraged . " Boys , get on home , " he said . " I 'm done with all of you . I do n't want to associate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Scaring an unfortunate creature like Billy when there ai n't no reason to scare him is just plain trashy behavior . I 've seen a lifetime of it and I 'm tired of putting up with it . You can just stay out of this poolhall and out of my picture show and cafe too . " With that he closed and locked the door and went upstairs to bed . The boys were thunderstruck . They had been prepared for Sam to rage and storm and instead he had simply closed the door and locked them out . No one knew what to say . They stood on the cold sidewalk a minute , confused . " We 're his best customers , " Leroy said . " He ca n't run us off , can he ? "  |p113Sonny  and the other boys knew very well he could . It made Sonny feel a little sick . They all crawled back into the pickup and Sonny delivered them to their homes . Duane did n't fully wake up until they were back at the rooming house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done he thought it was hilariously funny . Since he had been lying down and Sam had not seen him it was clear to Duane that he was not included in the banishment . " Good thing I went to sleep when I did , " he said . " I 'd hate to have to eat at that drive-in all the time . " He went in and contentedly went back to sleep , but Sonny stayed awake and reread most of an old copy of Outdoor Life . Duane taking the news the way he had made the evening even more depressing , and it had been depressing enough as it was . Kissing Mrs. Popper had been the only good thing that happened all night , and Sonny had no idea what would come of that . It occurred to him that at least it would be something exciting to think about in bed , so he turned the light off and tried it . Her face and the touch of her lips were fresh in his mind and it worked pretty well , though occasionally , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genevieve slipped in . Jacking off was an old game , monotonous , but a good way to get to sleep when all else failed.  |p114WHEN  SONNY KISSED MTS . Popper outside the Legion Hall it seemed to him that a whole spectrum of delicious experiencelay suddenly within his grasp . No kisses had ever been so exciting and so full of promise , neither for him nor for Ruth . She felt as if she were finally about to discoversomething she had somehow missed discovering twenty years before . Neither of them foresaw any great difficulties , just the minor difficulty of keeping it all secret . Both , in fact , were so excited that they longed to talk about it to someone , but that they could n't do . In Thalia sex was just not talked about . Even Genevieve would go to considerable lengths to keep from calling a spade a spade . Everything acknowledged the existence of sex : babies were born now and then , and things to prevent them were sold at the drugstores and one or two of the filling stations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how they wished they had more pussy , but it did n't really seem to bother many of them so long as the football team was doing well . The kids were told as little about sex as possible and spent most of their time trying to find out more . The boys speculated a lot among themselves and got the nature of the basic act straight when they were fairly young , but some of the girls were still in the dark about it when they graduated from high school . Many girls simply refused to believe that the things thep116boys peed out of could have any part in the creation of babies . They knew good and well that God would n't have wanted any arrangement of His to be that nasty . The only thing everyone agreed on was that the act itself could only be earthly bliss . Once the obstacle of virginity was done away with , mutual ecstasy would be the invariable result . One or two of the bolder girls knew differently , but they did n't want to be thought freaks so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met again , the Tuesday after the dance , they both expected things to be simple and wonderful , and they were both disappointed . For one thing , they both felt compelled to go through with the unnecessary trip to the doctor ; both of them were nervous and tense and they rode to Olney in silence . The dusty air had given Ruth a sniffle , and Sonny could see the bluish shadows under her eyes . The wait in Olney was short , but on the way back they found themselves even more at a loss for conversation than they had been coming . Ruth could not imagine what had possessed her to think she could bring off such a thing as a love affair . They each concluded that they were not as appealing in the daylight as they had been in the dark , so they sat looking out their separate windows at their separate sides of the road . There was little in the leafless winter landscape to cheer them . It was only when Sonny drove the Chevrolet into the dimness of the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly on the walls , that they regainedsome hope . They both realized they were about to miss the chance they had been counting on . Sonny reached for Ruth 's hand and she quickly scooted over toward him and they kissed . The kiss was awkward but warm and they did n't think of moving apart  --  for several minutes they let their mouths and faces touch . Both would have been just as happy to stay in the garage all afternoon , but they felt obligated to completep117the experience , and for that they had to go in the house , where things were not so good . The wallpaper in the bedroom was light green , and blotched in places . It was the bedroom where Ruth and Herman had spent virtually all their married nights : on one wall there was a plaque Herman had been given for taking a troop of Boy Scouts to the National Jubilee . Two or three copies of High School Athletics lay on the bedside table . " Are you sure he wo n't come ? " Sonny asked . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't , " Ruth said . " He 's just starting basketball practice . " She took his hand again and they kissed standing up . Neither of them really believed what she said : as they kissed both of them kept imagining the coach walking in . They were so conscious of him they hardly felt the kiss , but Ruth was determined to go on however dangerous it was , even if Herman did walk in . They were unable to think of a smooth way to undress  --  itwould have been better to do it while they were still kissing , but neither of them were expert enough for that . Ruth had on a dress and a slip , both of which had to come off over her head . Sonny could not even get her bra unhooked with the dress still on . Both of them wished for something to say , something that would break the tension , but neither could think of anything . Finally they simply broke apart and hurried about their own undressing . Ruth got her dress off , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the straps caught on a bobby pin  --  for an awkward moment she could not get the slip loose . Her face was hidden in the silk . Sonny moved to help her , but just as he did she tore it loose and looked up at him with a wry smile , as if to comment on her awkwardness . They took their undergarments off at the same time , both of them choked with embarrassment . Ruth glanced at Sonny 's body , curious and a little fright/ened . He was two or three steps away from her and for a moment they did not know how to get to one another . Sonny was too self-conscious about his erection to move . Finally , with another wry smile , Ruth sat down on the bed and he sat down with her . When she lifted her arms to embrace him he saw the small scar on her breast . They fell over in an embrace but in a moment scrambled up again : the room was cold and they needed to be under the covers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed again with pleasure . They were amazed at the feel of one another 's skin , but in a minute or two they began to be nervous again . It seemed to them they must have been lying there kissing for half an hour at least . Ruth touched her hand to Sonny 's throat and chest now and then , but other than that she did n't move . He felt very unsure : it occurred to him that perhaps his experience was inadequate . There might be some way of doing it that was especially suitable to ladies , some way he knew nothing about . Ruth had her eyes closed and was waiting trustfully for a beautiful thing to happen to her . She knew that Herman knew nothing about the beautiful thing , or that if he did he had no interest in giving it to her . But she supposed Sonny would know : she would only have to wait and receive it . His body was very warm against her . It was only when she opened her eyes and looked at him that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to do . " It 's all right , " she said , opening her legs . Sonny gratefullymoved above her , but there was another long moment of awkwardness when they tried to join . Sonny was not absolutely sure of the target , and when he found it Ruth could not at first accommodate him easily . When he moved she gasped and Sonny 's face was so close to hers that he could not tell whether she felt pain or pleasure.  |p119She  said nothing , so he kept moving  --  in a moment it becameeasier and pleasure made him move faster and more surely . For Ruth the discomfort was only momentary , but even once it ceased she could not manage to cross over into pleasure . The bed had begun to squeak . As Sonny moved more confidently it squeaked louder , and Ruth could not help hearing it . She would never have imagined it could squeak so loudly . Soon the squeaking drove all hope of pleasure from her mind . The noise made her fearful that someone outside the house might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house could hear it , she was sure . In a few moments she was near panic : she was convinced that everyone in Thalia could hear the squeaking bedsprings . If all the cars stopped , if the housewives came to their doors and listened , they could all hear the squeakingbed and would know what she was doing . It was a horrible bed ; she felt it had betrayed her . No one could receive a beautiful thing with such a squeaking going on beneath her . She tried to lay very still , but Sonny 's movementwent on , and the sound was constant . Finally she began to cry , and when the tears dripped down her cheeks and wet Sonny 's neck he realized that something was wrong after all . He raised his head and saw that Ruth 's eyes were flooded with tears . She was ashamed that she had stopped him and quickly hooked her arm over his neck so he would n't raise up and see her face again . Sonny felt she must want him to stop but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on , hearing the springs only as a faint background to his pleasure . Soon he finished and lay still upon her . As soon as the squeaking stopped Ruth felt better . She kept her arms around Sonny , holding him so he could not see her face and now and then wiping the tears out of her eyes with the back of one hand . Once Sonny be-120came still it was very pleasant to have his body upon hers  --  he was so warm and young , almost like a child . She had always wanted a child more than anything , but Herman would n't hear of it  --  he did n't want the expense . On the rare occasions when he took his pleasure of her he was always careful to wear a condom , even though they made Ruth 's bladder hurt . Having Sonny upon her was very different , and deeply pleasant . She ran her hands up and down his back , and when she felt composed again lifted her arms so he could raise his head . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just scared . " " Aw , he is n't going to come , " Sonny said , no longer worried . " They 're runnin ' plays right now , I bet . " " No , not scared of that , " Ruth said , touching his mouth softly with her fingers . " I was scared I could never do this , I guess . I wanted to be wholehearted about it , but I was n't . " She was silent a moment . " Do you know what it means to be heartbroken ? " she said . " It means your heart is n't whole , so you ca n't really do anything wholeheart-edly . " Sonny wanted to leave , but he did n't think he should , quite so soon . Mrs. Popper was sad , but at least she seemed calm and she kept touching him softly with her hands . He kissed her lightly and her cheeks were warm ; then he stretched and drew the covers back a little , so he could see more of her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little too thin . When Ruth saw he was looking at her she grew frightened . She had never considered her body attractive , and she was afraid that if Sonny looked too long he would not want to be with her anymore . She turned on her side and curled toward him , her head on his thighs . Her shoulder bones stuck out , making her look even thinner . Sonny rubbed her back a minute and then got out of bed and quietly dressed . Whenp121he sat down on the edge of the bed to tell her good-bye she was on the verge of tears again . " I was right the first time , was n't I ? " she said hopelessly . " I 'm too old and ugly for a young man like you . I do n't know how to do this anyway and maybe I 'm too old to learn . I ca n't do anything without crying about it  --  how could you like me ? " " I like you , " Sonny said awkwardly  --  actually he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous about himself , and she was certainly not as pretty as a movie star or as pretty as Jacy . Still , he did like her some . Since they had n't got caught he had begun to feel elated about the whole thing . It was an adventure to have slept with somebody 's wife . He did n't know if he would tell anybody or not , but it was sort of a feather in his cap , nonetheless . Ruth sighed . " If you like me then you decide what to do about me , " she said . " I 'm not going to chase after you anymore . If you really like me you figure out how to come and see me  --  I sure do n't want you to drive me to the doctor . I think right now you just like what you can do with me . That 's fine , but now that you 've found out women think you 're good looking you 'll probably want to go do it with somebody younger and prettier . I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave . She had become embarrassed about her body and did n't want him to see her naked anymore . She stayed curled up on the bed , her breasts and loins hidden from him . " Track starts pretty soon , " Sonny said . " I just wo n't go out . I can sneak up the alley and in the back door . " He sounded like he really wanted to , and Ruth changed back to hoping . What if he did only want her for sex ? It was more than anyone else had ever wanted her for . Suddenly she felt like doing something a little wanton and she sat up and kissed him , her naked breasts againstp122his shirt . Sonny liked that , and when he left he looked back through the doorway and saw her , still naked , bending over the bed to strip away the sheets . It would be well worth giving up track to come and see her , even though the coach would rage and storm at losing his only decent hurdler . The second time Sonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedsprings bothered her , but she did n't quite have the nerve . She really wanted them to lie down on the floor , but she was afraid if she told Sonny he would think her depraved or something . She knew men were curious when it came to women 's desires . Nothingrevolted Herman more than to think that she was enjoying him that way . Once or twice in their marriage she had felt something good , but when she began to move or wiggle beneath him to make it feel even better it made Herman furious . " Lay still , " he said . " What kind of woman do you think you are , anyway ? " After that she lay still , and if she happened to feel something a little good she did n't let him know . Herman was so heavy that most of the time she just felt mashed . She had not really expected Sonny to come again ; when he slipped inside the back door she was filled with delight , and determined not to make any mistakes that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the bedsprings bothered Ruth even more than they had the first time . They were almost too much . She felt something a little good but the springs kept her from concentrating on it ; everytime she felt it the grinding of the springs drove it away , and finally she simply endured them , waiting for the quiet lovely time when he was still , dozing on her body . Sonny knew something was wrong because Ruth 's body was cold and her arms and legs were tensed  --  she was trying to hold herself in such a way that the springsp123would be silent . She managed not to cry , but it took a long time for the tension to drain out of her  --  she was so tense that even the aftermath was not so enjoyable . Neither of them spoke  --  they simply had no words . Ruth was not sure she wanted him to come anymore ; it was not working out at all like she had imagined . But when she felt a little better she began to stroke his back and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , and she decided she did want him again . Something about it was good , even if much was bad . On his third visit she gathered up her nerve and told him , as they were undressing , that the noise of the bedspringsbothered her . She asked if they could lie on a quilt on the floor . Sonny was mildly surprised , but it was okay with him . When Ruth saw that he did n't think it was wrong of her to want it all to be nice she was so relieved she could n't speak . She walked to the hall closet , naked , and got an old blue quilt that she and Herman had quit using years ago . They spread the quilt on the floor by the little gas stove and sat a moment watching the flicker of the blue gas flames as they touched one another . They still could n't talk , but they had ceased to be nervous , and they quit trying to conceal their loins from one another . For Ruth the quiet was wonderful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and she knew no one in the street could hear them breathing . She realized too that Sonny was enjoying her keenly and that made her glad . He was in no hurry and Ruth had moments of pleasure that were stronger than any she had ever known before . She discovered that Sonny did n't mind at all if she moved : in fact , he liked it . She became excited enough that her breath was ragged , but it was all still new to her and she could not pull the moments of pleasure together into one that was complete . For her the beautiful time wasp124still afterward . Sonny was still inside her when he went to sleep , and Ruth found that lovely . It was almost as if he were a child inside her , and she put her calves over his legs to keep him there . When he finally came out she slipped upward on the quilt so that his warm cheek was against one of her breasts . It was so lovely that she wanted it not to change . That day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to leave . By the time Sonny had paid her a half-dozen visits he was everything to Ruth : he was what made the days worth confronting . The thought that he might quit coming filled her with terror . The thought of going back to the existence she had had before he came was too much to face . Sonny allowed her to love him , though it was strange to him and he had to get used to it slowly . They were soon able to spend four or five hours a week on the old blue quilt . Ruth learned a great deal about Sonny and also a great deal about herself . After the first weeks she did nothing that would frighten him . She learned that he liked to be naked around her  --  it gave him a sense of adventure . She gladly let him , often mending his shirts or patching his pants after they had made love . She discovered that she had no particular modesty about her loins , only about her breasts , which seemed to her too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonny , since apparently it disgusted Herman . She took to wearing one of Herman 's old hunting shirts while they talked . Sonny did n't like for her to wear anything while they were making love , but she always put it on afterward . She learned gradually how to play with him and how to tease him . One day she got a brush and comb and showed him a way to comb his hair that she felt was more becoming . Sonny was delighted . She would have liked to cut his hair for him , but there would n't have been time.  |p125She  soon made terms with lovemaking itself , though for a time they were not the best possible terms . She thought that once they relaxed with one another the beautiful thing would happen , the whole moment toward which all the sharp little individual moments tended . She had read about it , she expected it , she longed for it , and came very close to it , but it eluded her . For a week or two she was sure , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came so close that she was desperate for it to happen , and when she missed it after all her agitation was very intense . The violence of her excitement surprised Sonny and disturbed him a little : despite her weeping spells he thought of her as a quiet , rather timid woman . Her movements were sometimes so strong and unexpected that he was thrown off balance  --  once when she missed she was beside herself with disappointment . " Oh please , " she said . " Please keep going . " Sonny was already gone , but she continued to struggle against him until they were both soaked with sweat ; he could not call himself back , and she gave up . After that Sonny did n't come back for three days and Ruth was fearful she had ruined it all . When he did come he was so thrilled and relieved that she resolved not to seek the moment if it was going to put everything else in danger . If he would keep coming , keep wanting her , that would be enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt and rubbed his chest with her palm . When she looked past him , at the green wall paper and Sears and Roebuck furniture she realized that she had lived for years in a room that was terribly drab . Sonny was hesitant about making love , worried that he could cause Ruth disappointment again . " No , look , " she said , taking his hand and kissing his palms and fingers . " Nothing was your fault . You have to remember that I 've been lonely for a long time . Loneliness is like ice . After you 've been lonely long enough you do n't even realizep126you 're cold , but you are . It 's like I was a refrigerator that had never been defrosted at all  --  never . All these years the ice has just been getting thicker . You ca n't melt all that ice in a few days , I do n't care how good a man you are . I did n't even realize it , like I did n't realize till just now how ugly this room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me there 's some ice that never will melt , maybe it 's just been there too long . But you must n't worry . You did n't put it there . " She moved her hand up to his shoulders . The talk of ice and refrigerators meant little to Sonny , but he was relieved that she wanted him to make love to her again . That day she was very warm and amenable , but much calmer  --  calmer than he had ever known her . He recognized that in a way she had withdrawn from the struggle , but his own pleasure was so strong that he merely felt grateful , not responsible . She saw to it that he did n't feel responsible , and for herself , had no difficulties except at the very end  --  then , for a wistful , regretful moment , she felt like crying . After that , for more than a month , she concentrated on making Sonny welcome . He came often , sometimes just to make love , sometimes staying to drink some hot chocolate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate and the clothes mending , but Ruth knew very well that what they did on the quilt was what he really liked , what he enjoyed doing with her . It thrilled her that that , of all things , would be what made a person want to come and see her . She expected , almost from day to day , that he would tire of her , and when she saw him coming in the door wanting that same thing of her , she was always happy for a moment . Then , in March , things changed . Sonny came in one day and repeated a story about Coach Popper , one he had just heard . The week before the coach had taken the trackp127boys to a meet in Fort Worth . Bobby Logan was sharing a room with the coach and in the middle of the night the coach mistook Bobby for Mrs. Popper and kissed him on the ear . All the boys thought that was pretty hilarious , and Sonny repeated the story to Ruth because he thought it might get her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help being curious about their life together . She told him that the coach seldom touched her , but Sonny could hardly believe that . The coach was so hairy and horny looking that the boys all supposed he kept after her all the time . Around the gym and the practice field the coach gave the impression that he was an inveterate woman chaser . " Find ' em , fool ' em , fuck ' em , and forget ' em , " he was often heard to say . Sonny had the nagging feeling that the reason Ruth could n't come with him was because the coach 's tool was bigger and better . Time and again the coach had pointed out to one boy or another the ignominy of having an insufficient tool . " Why hell yes , Joe Bob , " he would say . " A feller can get along with false teeth and a glass eye and hearing aids and even a hook or a wooden leg if he has to , but there ai n't no known substitute for a big dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When he told Ruth about the ear-kissing incident he half expected her to be flattered that her husband would miss her so , but instead she looked miserable and forlorn . They had already finished lovemaking and she was so dispirited by the news that she neglected even to cover herself with the flannel shirt . " I do n't care , " she said , tears seeping out of her eyes . " I do n't care who he likes . If he wants to play around with little boys and they think it 's funny why should I care ? I just get tired of everybody thinking he 's such a mighty man just because he coaches football . I 'm the one they think is nothing , just his mousy wife , and they 're right , I am mousy . I might not have been if I had n't beenp128ignored for twenty years . Nov I 'm forty and I do n't have any children and I ca n't even do . . . " sniffed , " I ca n't even do sex . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why did you stay with him , " he asked finally . Then it was Ruth who was dumb . It was a question she had avoided for years . " I was n't brought up to leave a husband , " she said in a small voice . " I guess that 's why . Or maybe I was just scared to . " " But how did you come to marry him ? " Sonny asked , still curious . " Because my mother did n't like him , I guess , " Ruth said . " I was fooled too . I was twenty years old and I thought hairy-chested football coaches were about it . I 've paid for my own bad judgment . " There the conversation stalled  --  Ruth was too depressedto talk , and Sonny was confused . It seemed to him that Ruth must think the coach was queer or something , and the coach was the last man that anyone would accuse of such a thing . A few of the boys thought Mr. Cecil must be  --  they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all swimming and horsing around naked at the irrigation ditch  --  but Mr. Cecil was much too much of a gentleman to do anything out of the ordinary , and nobody knew for sure about him . To suspect the coach of being that way was entirely too much  --  he did n't even mention the conversation to Duane . In fact , he had never told Duane he was sleeping with Mrs. Popper because he was afraid Duane would make fun of him for sleeping with an older woman . It was that night , after that conversation , that things began to change for Ruth . She dreamed she was having a baby . She had had such dreams for years , but usually they were vague and fragmentary , but this one was vivid . It was not just a baby she had , though ; it was Sonny . He wasp129removed from between her legs , and afterward lay at her breast . The next day Sonny came , and while they were spreading the blue quilt on the bedroom floor Ruth remembered the dream . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lay quietly , her eyes closed , as Sonny began , but almost before she knew it she became excited , so much so that she could not be still . She thought of the dream again , hoping the excitement would die before she became completely possessed by it , but instead of dying it became keener . Because of the dream , pleasure took her over : with her eyes shut she could pretend she was giving birth . Sonny was inside her but in truth she was bringing him out  --  it was that which excited her . She grabbed his hands and put them on her thighs , so that he would force them wider . She was filled with a strength that she had not suspected and held him with her thighs , just at the entrance , just connected , both of them struggling , until she was finally seized , rent by what she felt . Then she took Sonny back to her , her heart was pounding , her eyelids fluttering ; she almost fainted with the relief of delivery . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonny lay on top of her , not knowing if he dared move . He had no doubt that Ruth had broken through , but her success was as strange and almost as frightening as her failures . The strength she had called up amazed him : for minutes she had held him with just her thighs , his arms pinned to his sides so tightly he could not get one free . Yet , sleeping beneath him , she might have been a girl , so still and at peace she seemed . When Ruth awakened she did not want Sonny to leave . She felt entirely comfortable , and she wanted to touch him , play with him , have his hand on her . After that , she never used the dream again , but she kept it in her mind as a safeguard , and even though she still sometimesmissed , having the dream was a great reassurance.  |p130In  the weeks after Ruth 's breakthrough the two of them became very close and comfortable . Once Sonny quit worrying about her response or lack of response , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were even afternoons when he visited her , not to make love but just to talk , hold hands , or watch television . Only one problem arose , and that was one they had been expecting : the town knew about them . A couple of the housewives who lived along the alley compared notes , and in a few days the town knew . Sonny worried about it a lot , Ruth hardly at all . " What do you think the coach would do if he found us ? " Sonny asked one day . Ruth was sitting on the quilt combing her brown hair . She had decided to let her hair grow longer . " Probably shoot us both , " she said lightly . " He 's alwaysglad to have an excuse to use his deer rifle . " Sonny mused on that and decided she was right . " What do you think we ought to do about it ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " Ruth said , puckering her mouth at him happily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's about had it . " The next day she got one , for sentimental reasons also blue.  |p131ONE  NIGHT IN mid-March Sonny woke up too early  --  around 3:30 A.M. The first thing that occurred to him was that Sam the Lion would be asleep . Sam the Lion had made his decree of banishment stick , and , though Sonny had endured it as best he could , he had about reached the point where he could endure it no longer . It occurred to him that if he got dressed and went down to the cafe Genevieve might let him sit and talk awhile . A cold March norther was blowing and the warm blankets were hard to leave , but the chances were he would have to leave them in an hour or so anyway , to make an early butane run . Genevieve was sitting in one of the booths , reading an old issue of the Ladies Home Journal . To his immense relief she looked delighted to see him . " Come on in here , " she said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could I have a cheeseburger ? " he asked quickly . One of the worst parts of the penalty had been eating at the drive-in , where the cheeseburgers were half raw and the tomatoes soggy . " You can have two if you want them , " she said , and she made him two while he sat nervously in the booth . When she brought them in he swallowed the first one in only five or six bites.  | " Quit eating so fast , " Genevieve said . " You 've lost weight . Even if it was a terrible thing to do to Billy , I 'm on your side . " Sonny was grateful . " I could n't talk them out of it , " he said . " It was Leroy 's idea . " " Where was Duane ? " she asked . It was a ticklish question . Duane had gone right on using the cafe and the poolhall , just as if he had n't been along . It was a sore spot with the other boys , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duane 's part in it . Thinking about it made Sonny uneasy . " He was there , " he admitted . " Just do n't tell Sam . " " I figured he was , " Genevieve said quietly . " He just did n't have the decency to own up and take his punishment . He probably got just as big a kick out of it as Leroy did . " Sonny was embarrassed and kept eating cheeseburger . Nobody had ever criticized Duane in front of him before  --  for no reason that he could think of life was becoming more complicated . " Well , I wo n't say no more about it , " she said . " That 's between you and him . But you 've got to make up with Sam , that 's for sure . I wo n't have you eating at that driveinanymore . He misses you and he 'll make it up if you do it right . He knows you too well to think you really went out of your way to upset Billy . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's well enough to be contrary . " Sonny began to relax . The cafe was just the same : the jukebox , the booths , the high-school football schedule pinned on the wall . Genevieve cradled the coffee cup in her hand and stared at the frost-smoked windows . " I 've gotten into something else , " Sonny said tentatively . She was the only person he could think of that he might be able to talk to . " Got a new girl friend ? " she grinned , and then shep133suddenly remembered the gossip . Until that moment she had not taken it at all seriously . I guess I have , " Sonny said . " Not a girl friend , a lady friend . It 's Mrs. Popper . " He did n't know whether he was glad to have the secret out , and Genevieve was not sure at all that she was glad to have received it . " Ruth Popper ? " she said , amazed . " How do you mean , Sonny ? Have you been flirtin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it different ? " " It 's different , " he said . " It 's . . . like in a movie . " She saw that he was watching her face , dreadfully anxious to know what she thought about the news . " I do n't know what to think about you , " she said . " Quit lookin ' at me that way . This is an awful small town for that kind of carrying on , I can tell you that . You ca n't sneeze in this town without somebody offerin ' you a handkerchief . " " Coach Popper do n't care nothin ' about her , " Sonny said . " I do n't see why he should care . " " He cares about himself , though  --  and about what people think of him . He owns a lot of guns , too . " Sonny looked so young and solemn and confused that after a moment it all amused her and she chuckled . He looked far too confused to be into anything wicked . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about it . You 're a man of experience now , you do n't need my advice anyway . " Sonny did n't know about advice , but he was glad to have her approval , however he could get it . He had some pie and chatted about lesser things until the streets outsidewere gray with a cold dawn . Genevieve got up to tend to the coffee maker . " I better go on , " Sonny said . " Sam 's going to be coming any time . " " You stay , " Genevieve said , not even turning around . Sonny did n't like the idea , but he did n't have longp134to worry about it . In a few minutes the cafe door opened and Sam the Lion and Billy stepped inside . Sam had on his old plaid mackinaw , his khakis , and his house shoes . When he saw Sonny he opened his mouth to say somethingbut Genevieve cut him off . " Do n't say a word , " she said . " I wo n't have him eating at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized person and you can listen to him . " When Billy saw Sonny his face brightened and he went right over and sat down by him . He had forgotten all about the bad night , and did n't remember anything bad that Sonny had done . Sonny turned his baseball cap around backward for him . " I 'm sorry , " Sonny said , when Sam the Lion came to the booth . " Scoot over , " Sam said , a little embarrassed . " If Billy can stand you I can too . " He sat down by Sonny and ordered his sausage and eggs . Sonny was so relieved that he could n't think of anything to say , and Sam the Lion was so relieved that he could n't keep quiet . There was the basketball team to talk about , a disgraceful , hapless basketballteam that had n't come within thirty points of winning a game . Sam the Lion gave it hell , and continued giving it hell as the cafe filled , as the cowboys and the truckers came in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a dozen or more cups of Genevieve 's coffee . Sam the Lion poured his in a saucer and went on talking while the two boys , not listening , happily ate their breakfasts.  |p134IT  WAS IN THE early spring , when Sonny was really beginning to get in touch with Ruth , that Duane really began to get out of touch with Jacy . He forgave her for going to the nude swimming party in Wichita , but somehowthey were never as comfortable with one another as they had been before that happened . The thing that bothered Duane most was that , instead of going to Wichita less and less , Jacy was going more and more . It got so he was lucky if he spent one Saturday night a month with her . Time after time she drove off to Wichita with Lester Marlow , always , she said , because her mother insisted . Duane raged and stormed , but he never quite got up the guts to have it out with Lois . Instead , he decided to concentrate on getting Jacy to marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her application in to several fancy girls ' schools , and he realized that if she got away to college he would have seen the last of her . His only chance was to marry her sometime during the summer , while she was still at home . Jacy , however , had put aside all thought of marrying Duane . She had convinced =herself that that would be a very selfish thing to do . Her parents , particularly her father , would never stand for it : he would have it annulled , Duane would lose his job and would probably be in the army before the summer was out . It would clearlyp136be unfair of her to put Duane in such a position . If she sacrificed what she felt for him , he could keep his job and stay out of the army several months longer . It was the sort of thing he would thank her for someday . The truth was , Jacy had been very strongly affected by the nude swimming party . Unknown to anyone but herself and Lester she had been back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the Saturday night trips were of her own arranging , but she told Duane they were her mother 's doings . Duane was too naive to understand her wanting to mix with kids like herself , kids who had money and lived recklessly . It would save everyone misery to let him think it was her mother 's fault . Jacy had begun to be very attracted to Bobby Sheen , the leader of the wild set . He was not especially handsome , but he combed his hair in a rakish fashion and he was always merry and lustful . It was rumored that he and Annie-Annie made love four times a week , sometimes in curious ways . He had an air of absolute confidence , as if he were ready for anything and could do anything that might be demanded of him . At first Jacy did n't give herselfmuch of a chance with him , supposing that he and Annie-Annie would soon get married ; but then she danced with him one night and took hope . He got erections while dancing with her , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought it was really going to happen between Bobby and herself . After one of the naked swimming parties the boys and girls paired off and went to bed in various bedrooms of the huge Sheen house . Jacy had to share a bed with Lester Marlow , but that was all right ; the first time it had happened she had made it quite clear to Lester that sharing the bed was all she intended to do . Anything more intimate was out of the question . Lester had red pubic hair , which seemed to her ridiculous . After this particular party Lester andp137Jacy both went to sleep , as usual , but somebody woke Jacy up by kissing her . It was Bobby Sheen , and he did n't have any clothes on . When he saw she was wide awake he quietly motioned for her to follow him , and she did , trembling a little . Fortunately she had on some green pajamas , so it was not too immodest . Bobby led her down the carpeted hall to an empty bedroom and the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top and began to play with her breasts . He was merry and confident about it all and it did n't occur to Jacy to stop him . There was a huge double bed in the room and once they got on it Bobby undressed her completely . Jacy was excited and decided to cast caution to the winds . She let him get between her legs and was prepared to let him go all the way , but he stopped wanting to . He started to and did something that hurt a little before he stopped , looking at her with disbelief . " Are you a virgin ? " he asked . " I guess so , " Jacy admitted miserably . " But I do n't want to be . " Bobby made a face of mock-horror , as if he had discovered a leper in his bed . " What a letdown , " he said , but with his usual good cheer . " I 'm sorry I woke you up . Why do n't I give you the name of a gynecologist ? There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . " " Okay , " Jacy said , eager to be agreeable . She was not sure what having the name of such a person committed her to , but she was willing to try anything Bobby recommended . The look on his face made her realize that it was absolutely ridiculous for her to be a virgin : she was probablythe only one in the whole house . That thought was so mortifying that she sat up and reached for her pajamas , prepared to go ignominiously back to bed . Bobby , however , was not all that discouraged.  | " Do n't run off , " he said cheerfully . " I was just surprised . If you 're not sleepy we can still play around a while . " Jacy was not sure what that involved either , but she dutifully lay back down . " What about Annie-Annie ? " she asked . " That bitch sleeps like a horse , " Bobby said . Jacy was quite shocked to discover all that " playing around " involved . Bobby Sheen knew amazing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one second if it had been anyone other than him . As it was , she was determined not to show her ignorance and just let him do whatever he pleased . Him doing things was okay , but when he wanted her to do things to him she was so nervous and shaky that she got goose bumps all over . Bobby could n't help giggling . " Do n't boys have cocks in that town you live in ? " he asked , laughing . Jacy was at a loss for an answer . For days she could not get the evening off her mind . It seemed to her she had come off very badly with Bobby . He did n't call her for any dates afterward , and every other boy who had ever been near her had promptly called her for dates . The only conclusion possible was that Bobby found her backward and country , and if there was anything she hated and loathed it was to be thought backward and country . It was clear that she was going to have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and came up with a plan that seemed to have multiple advantages . The week after graduation the senior class was going on what was called their senior trip . For four years the class had saved up money for it , and had given bake sales , conductedscrap iron drives , and done all sorts of other chores to make the money . They were going all the way to San Francisco and back on the bus and it would take every bit of the money they had made . She and Duane would thusp139be together practically all the time for a whole week , and it occurred to her that if she let Duane sleep with her sometime during the trip it would solve all kinds of problems . For one thing , it would make the senior trip . She and Duane would be regarded as extraordinarily daring , and all the kids would talk about them all the way home . Also , if she slept with Duane a time or two it would make it that much easier for her to break up with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something beautifulto remember , and he would n't be able to say she had promised him anything she had n't delivered . Then when she got back from the trip she would no longer be a virgin and could set about taking Bobby Sheen away from Annie-Annie . If she could get him in love with her before the summer was over she might forgetabout the girl 's schools and go to S.M.U. , where Bobby was going . They might even pledge related fraternities . The one flaw in the whole plan was Duane . It occurredto her that he might not want to break up with her even if she let him sleep with her before breaking the news . He was dead set on their getting married in the summer , and he was a very stubborn boy . She decided that the best thing to do would be to make an ally of Sonny  --  she knew Sonny would do anything she wanted him to if she played up to him the least little bit . If Duane got ugly and would n't quit trying to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duane would never in his life excuse that . The senior play was rehearsing at that time and Sonny and Jacy both had parts . In order to strengthen her hold over him Jacy started giving Sonny a ride home every night ; often , at her suggestion , they would ride out to the lake and sit and talk a while before going home . Jacy mostly wanted to talk about Duane , about how much she wanted to marry him but how frightened she was that it would never work out , her parents being set against it likep140they were . Sonny tried to listen , but mostly he just looked . Jacy had a way of leaning forward so she could hook a finger inside her blouse and straighten her bra strap , a movement that always made him ache with desire . Even the flash of her white teeth as she popped her chewing gum  --  even that could cause discomfort . Once in a moment of emotion she reached out and they held hands for a little while . " I tell you I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you to talk to , Sonny , " she said affectionately . At such times Sonny could hardly keep from wishing that Duane and perhaps Ruth too were out of the picture . Jacy was everything he wanted . She had always seemed infinitely more desirable than Charlene or the other girls , but she had also begun to seem cool and simple and lovely in contrast to Ruth , who had begun to disturb him a good deal . Once Ruth found pleasure her need for him rapidly increased and her sensual appetite had become , if anything , stronger than his own . At first he had found it delightful  --  he had never imagined that he would ever in his life have as much sex as he wanted . By the time he had visited Ruth almost daily for a month he was forced to admit to himself that it might even be possible to have more than he wanted . Ruth lost all caution , all concern for what the townspeople might think . All she wanted was Sonny , and he began to feel strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , or to sleep particularly well . Despite almost daily sex he had erotic dreams at night and would often wake up to find himself painfully engorged . As he grew more tired and less certain of himself , Ruth seemed to grow fresher , more self-possessed , and more lovely , though it was only at odd , oblique moments , lying beside her or coming into her room , that he noticed that she was lovely . Instead of drooping about the house as she had once done she acquired grace and animationp141and moved about as active and lithe as a girl . She even repapered the bedroom , much to the coach 's disgust . Sonny found he could not keep a consistent feeling about her two days or even two hours in a row . At one moment , during lovemaking , seeing her become avid , sweaty , almost frenzied , he felt as he had the first day with her in the car , as if he were being pulled by some force stronger than his own . A few moments later , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmed , lit from within , her eyes wide and soft , and feel completely happy with her . He simply could not understand what had happened to her . When she touched him , drew him into her , it was not that she was trying to have him exactly  --  she was insistingthat he have her . She was not saying " You 're mine , " she was saying " I 'm yours , " and that was almost more troubling . She was completely focused on him ; the rest of her life had ceased to matter . Her hair had grown longer , and he loved to smooth tendrils of it back behind her ears . But he was n't sure that he wanted any person to be his : it made him too responsible . " You 're my love , I ca n't help it , " she would say , if he brought the matter up . And she would go on brushing her hair , completely at peace with herself because of him . One night he almost gave way to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't because he realized just in time that it would mean the end of his talks with Jacy . She wanted to tall about her problems , not his . Becauseof their talks she began to fill his fantasies again , and the fantasies made a fitful background to his afternoons with Ruth . Somehow he was sure that passion with Jacy would be more intense and yet less strained than it sometimeswas with Ruth . With Jacy things would be sharper and better timed , and would never be blunted by anxiety or bad balance or anything.  |p142To  Ruth , that period of her life later seemed a little insane , but insane in a good way . She remembered little about it , just Sonny 's person . Occasionally it occurred to her that people were probably talking , or that she ought to go to the store or somewhere , but none of those things seemed immediate . Sonny was the only thing immediate . Later , when time was passing much more slowly , she told herself that she had not planned well  --  she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for the morrow , but it was because she did not suppose she could afford to think about the morrow . It was not until an evening in early May that the fact of a future was brought home to her . Sonny had come that afternoon , and all had gone well . Three hours later , while Herman was finishing his supper , Ruth went out into the backyard and began to take some clothes off the line . It was just dusk , a soft spring dusk , and as she was unpinning Herman 's stiff , unironed khakis a car went by on the street . Idly curious , she glanced around to see who was passing and saw Sonny and Jacy , on their way to play practice in Jacy 's convertible . She only glimpsed them as the car passed between her house and the next , and all she saw really was the glint of spring sunset on Jacy 's gold hair . She did not even see Sonny 's face , did not know whether he looked happy or glum to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment or two she had to hold onto the clothesline  --  it was as if she had been struck a numbing blow across her thighs . Her legs felt so unsteady that she could hardly move down the line to the next stiff pair of pants . Sonny had never mentioned Jacy to her : she had glimpsed the very beginning of something . Duane and Jacy might have broken up . As she dragged the sheets off the line she felt a sudden panic , silly but nonetheless terrifying . She was sure that Sonny was in love with Jacy and would never come to her house again . She would havep143wept , but the dread that seized her was too dry . It was as if she had suddenly been faced with her own end , an end too dry and commonplace to cry about . When all the clothes were piled in the basket she stood in the yard a minute , under the empty lines , her only comfort the soft evening air . She could not stand the thought of going into the tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the next moment a thought came to her and she grabbed the clothes basket and hurried in . Hermanhad finished the peas and was eating a bowlful of yellow canned peaches , one of his favorite desserts . " Herman , " she asked , " have Duane and Jacy broken up ? I thought I saw her go by just now with someone else in the car . " The coach looked up with mild interest . " Hope so , " he said . " Nothin ' I 'd like better than to see them two bust up . I might get a couple of good baseball games out of Duane if they would . " Ruth took heart and took out the ironing board and sprinkler bottle . Life came back into her legs ; she decided the spasm of dread had been irrational . Even so , consideringit calmly , it was clear that in time she was bound to be hurt , and badly so . She was twenty years older than him , and he would not keep wanting her forever . Sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , but she was so relieved to know that it was going to be later  --  not for a week , at least , and perhaps not for a month or even a year  --  that she resolved not to care . As she ironed she indulged herself in the pleasant fantasy that she was in Sonny 's room , doing the ironing for him . She nursed a strong secret wish to go to his room sometime , to be with him where he lived rather than where Herman lived . The coach finished his peaches and lay on the couch for a couple of hours , watching television while Ruth finished ironing . When the late news came on he turnedp144the set off : news bored him . He straggled lazily into the bedroom to undress , and found that Ruth was there ahead of him , sitting on the edge of the bed rubbing hand lotion into her hands . She had her shoes off and was barefooted . It seemed to the coach that she looked younger than a woman her age ought to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked young . He did n't know it , but she had managed to sustain her favorite fantasy all the way to the bedroom and was pretending to herself that she was undressing in Sonny 's room . All the coach knew was that she irritated him . She went to the closet to hang up her dress and even the lightness of her walk irritated him . He sat down in the rocker to pull off his sweaty socks , remembering that she had mentioned Jacy and Duane . " Who was it you seen with Jacy ? " he asked , stirred by his dislike of the girl . " I did n't get a good look at the boy , " Ruth said , a little surprised . " It was Sonny Crawford I think . " The coach grunted . He stood up , emptied his pockets onto the dresser , and pitched his pants through the bathroom door in the general direction of the dirty-clothes hamper . It was a warm night and the room seemed a little close to him . He threw up a window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his testicles and enjoying the nice south breeze . After a minute he stretched out on the bed , but forsome reason he could n't get Jacy Farrow off his mind . Itwas little twats like her that ruined young athletes , so far as he was concerned . If it had n't been for her , Duanewould have come out for track and they might have wona track championship . As he lay on his back , still scratchinghimself , he thought how nice it would be to hump alittle rich girl like her until she got so sick of it she wouldnever want to see another boy , much less bother one . Thatwould be a smart piece of coaching , but hard to bring off . While his thoughts were running in that directionp145he happened to glance over and notice Ruth  --  or at least he noticed half of her . She was undressing behind the closet door , but the strong breeze had blown the door open a bit wider than usual and Ruth was half exposed , the line of the door bisecting her body . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the side of her head as she turned and reached into the closet to take her gown off the hook . Ordinarily the sight of Ruth 's body gave him a feeling of mild distaste : his own mother had stood five-eleven and had worked just as hard as men worked nearly every day of her life . Nothing seemed more pathetic to him than a skinny woman , Ruth especially , but when he glanced at the closet he was not thinking of Ruth at all but of Jacy Farrow . He was thinking that if he ever got Jacy into the right corner he would pay back all the little pusses who had kept his boys stirred up over the years . The thought of administering such a lesson had him a little excited  --  his underwear developed a sizable hump . Ruth stepped out from behind the door , lowering the gown over her body , and the coach looked at her again . Something told him he would never get Jacy into the right corner , but Ruth was right there and she was just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time  --  if she had n't he would have stayed a bachelor and had the money to take some real hunting trips . He could have gone to Alaska , even . She deserved a prod as much as Jacy ; no woman who had done a proper day 's work moved as lightly as she moved . Ruth 's mind was still elsewhere  --  she was unaware of the state her husband was in . It was not a state she had expected him to be in again . She sat down on the bed with her back to him and rubbed her calves a minute before stretching out . While she was sitting there the springs squeaked and Herman got out of bed ; she supposed he had forgotten to go to the bathroom . " Turn off the light in there , please , when you'rep146done , " she said . Light from the bathroom made a bright patch on the floor of the darkened bedroom . Then she turned to lie down and noticed with a start that Herman was not headed for the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwear bulging out ludicriously . The sight stunned her , as it always had : all their married life Herman had announced his arousal by going to the dresser and rummaging in the sock drawer until he found the prophylactics . While she watched he found a package and strode into the bathroom to make himself ready . She knew that she was supposed to use the time while he was in the bathroom to prepare herself for wifely service , but she suddenly felt as if her whole body had becomestiff as a plank . She had been thinking how nice it would be to spend a whole night in Sonny 's room , but when confronted with Herman 's intention all thought seemed to leave her . She merely lay on the bed , not thinkingat all . When Herman came out he switched off the bathroomlight , so that the bedroom was dark . He lay down heavily and without hesitation rolled himself onto Ruth , only to roll back a moment later , chagrined . " What the hell ? " he said . " You done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what she was supposed to do on such occasions : lift her nightgown and spread her legs . Those two actions were all that Hermanrequired of her in the way of sexual cooperation . She raised her hips off the bed and pulled up the gown , and when he was satisfied that the obstruction had been removedthe coach rolled back onto her and after a couple of badly aimed thrusts , made connection . Once he struck the place he went at it athletically . Ruth clenched her fists at her sides . Her chest and abdomen felt crushed , but it crossed her mind that she had crushed herself . What was crushing her was the weightp147of all the food she had fed Herman through the years , all the steaks , all the black-eyed peas , all the canned peaches . It was particularly the canned peaches : she had never until that moment realized how much she hated them . It seemed to her that pyramids of cans of slimy peaches piled on her abdomen . After a moment the weight became intolerable and she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved from side to side and stretched her legs , to try and escape it . Herman sweated easily and his sweat was already dripping down her ribs , but what bothered her was the weight of the cans . As she kept moving , trying to lighten the weight , she became aware of a distant pleasure . She began to writhe a little , in order to adjust the weight of the pyramid and intensify the pleasure  --  she flexed her legs and raised the lower part of her body a little , trying to get the weight right on the throbbing nerve . Her movements annoyed the coach a great deal . When he started he had not even been thinking of her , but of Jacy , and thinking of Jacy had been very enjoyable . At first Ruth had acted perfectly decent , but just when it was getting nicest she began to writhe and wiggle and even started going up and down against him . The coach was too surprised and outraged to speak , and anyway he had got to the point where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to beat Ruth down with his body , so she would be still again , but his efforts had the opposite effect : the harder he tried the more she moved . He could n't slow her down at all , and he could n't stop himself . For a minute , with pounding heartbeats , they were running a hundred-yard dash with each other on equal terms . Neither knew how close the tape was , neither was sure of victory , but the coach crossed first . He recaptured Jacy for a second and desperately burst across , gasping with exhaustion and pleasure . Ruth was just at the turn . The weight was terribly sharp for a moment and then thep148coach 's heavy surge burst the pyramid and left her gasping , free of all weight . For his part the coach wanted badly to be gone on his side of the bed . Quickly he withdrew , but to his amazement and shame Ruth would not let him . She grasped him , put him back , would not have him leave , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working of their lungs the two were still . In time , when their breath became quieter , the room was totally silent . The coach did not try again to withdraw , for fear he could n't . When he did in the natural fashion he quickly rolled onto his side of the bed . Ruth was away , in a misty , drowsy country , but even there she felt a little worried and a little sad . She had not meant it and could not understand how she had done it , given Herman something she thought was only for Sonny . It was as if her body had betrayed a trust and responded to the very man who had neglected it most . Perhaps she was not safe , not even from Herman . Hearing his exhaustedbreathing in her ear she had had a moment of sympathy for him as a person . She had felt for him a little bit . Perhaps she was no longer safe from anyone ? The coach knew good and well he was n't safe . His body wanted to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have imagined his own wife would grasp him : it was something worse than shameless . He did n't want to remain in the same bed with her and considered going to the couch . Still , Ruth was the one who had beslimed the bed : she ought to go . The messiness of the female body had never been more offensive to him . If he even moved his leg he touched a wet spot . Disgusted , he got up and went in the bathroom to clean himself . The bright light made him blink . When he came back to the bed , Ruth was dozing . She knew he was offended , but it did n't touch her . She felt pleasantly sleepy and had overcome her mild distressp149at being suddenly accessible . If Herman was going to insist on his connubial rights , then all the better that she could finally enjoy it . The coach stood over her in the dark , mad , but vaguely uneasy too . He had never dreamed Ruth had such wildness in her , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't you gon na change them sheets ? " he asked sourly . " Hum ? No . Why ? " she asked drowsily . " Well by God , " he said , walking distractedly around the bed . " You 're a fine one , ai n't you . If my mother was alive and knew how you acted she 'd have your hide . I 've always heard women got nasty in their old age but I never thought it would happen to no wife of mine . " " Did n't you like it , Herman ? " Ruth asked , still sleepily . She was near enough asleep that she could be a little mean . With a grunt the coach lay down and turned his back on her . Like it ! It was a fine come-off . What could a man say to a damn woman ?  | " KEEP AN EYE on them corks , Billy , " Sam the Lion said , getting to his feet . " I 've got to go water the grass a little . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock tank , and Billy , also undisturbed , sat by the water 's edge , watching them . Sonny was stretched out on his stomach in the Bermuda grass along the base of the tank dam . The May sun on his back was so warm that it made him drowsy , and he was almost asleep , content to leave Billy in full charge of the three fishing poles . Sam the Lion took a long time to water the grass , but he finally came back , grumbling and buttoning his pants . " Be nice to be able to piss , " he said . " If I last another year I 'll be dribblin ' it on my shoes . I 'd almost be willing to be young again if I could take a real piss . Looks like we ai n't gon na catch much today . " " We never do , " Sonny said . Once every year or two the pretty spring weather would tempt Sam the Lion to get out and , as he put it , get a little scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his scenery from the pretty calendars the local foodstore put out . When the urge for the outdoors came on him he would get Billy and the three fishing poles , enlist Sonny as a driver , and take the boys year after year to the same tank , perhaps the worst stocked fishing tank in the whole county . Once in a while they caught a perch or two , but always such undernourished specimens that old Marston refused to cook them.  | " Hell , Sam , you would n't have nothing but two ounces of fried bones if I did cook them , " he maintained . Sam the Lion did n't much care , and neither did the boys . Billy loved to sit on the bank and watch the rings in the water or the dragonflies that skimmed along the surface . He was always surprised and a little disconcerted when Sam the Lion grabbed one of the poles and actually pulled up a fish . When he looked into the water he saw no fish , and he was never really sure where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozing and got up and walked along the tank dam a little way . It was a beautiful afternoon , a good clay not to be doing anything  --  the sky was very blue and the pastures were green with spring grass and mesquite . In a moment he himself had the urge to water the grass in the way that Sam had , and he walked to the edge of the dam to do it . He felt warm and well and was faintly pleased by the spurt of his own water , even stretching himself a little to see if he could send a stream all the way to the foot of the dam . He did n't quite make it , but it was a high sloping dam and he came close enough to be fully content with his own range . It was only as he turned around and was buttoning himself that he noticed that Sam the Lion had observed his little game . It embarrassed him just a little , but it did something much stranger to Sam the Lion . Sam began to snort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then he began to laugh his loud , solid , rich laugh , something he did so rarely that both boys were startled . He sat by the water laughing , running his hands through his hair . Tears began to run down his face so freely that Sonny was not sure what was happening , whether Sam was laughing or crying . He pulled his handkerchiefout of his hip pocket and began to wipe his face but no sooner had he done that than he burst out cussing and got up and stomped around furiously on the Bermuda grass.  | " Goddammit ! Goddammit ! " he cursed . " I do n't want to be old . It do n't fit me ! " Then , seeing that the boys were scared , he became embarrassed and sat back down , still sniffing and snorting . He looked at the water and blew his nose and for a minute tried to pretend that nothing out of the ordinary had happened . But both boys continued to stare at him and he gave it up and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son , " he said , looking at Sonny a little ruefully . " Seein ' you pissing off the dam reminded me of something . I used to own this land you know . It 's been right at fifty years since the first time I watered a horse at this tank . Reason I always drag you all out here probably  --  I 'm just as sentimental as anybody else when it comes to old times . What you reminded me of happened twenty years ago  --  I brought a young lady swimming here . It was after my boys were already dead , my wife had lost her mind . Me and this young lady were pretty crazy , I guess . She had all the spirit in the world , and we had some times . We come out here swimmin ' one day without no bathin ' suits and after we got out of the water I walked off up there to piss . She was always on the lookout for something funny and she offered to bet me a silver dollar I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . I took the bet and gave it a try but I never came no closer than you did . The lady 's still got the silver dollar . " He was quiet , looking at the water . Sonny had never known Sam the Lion except as an old man , and he was surprised and a little awed by the story . He wanted to ask who the woman was , but he did n't have the nerve . " What became of the lady ? " he asked . " Oh , she growed up , " Sam the Lion said , a tone of regret in his voice . " She was just a girl then , really . " " How come you never married her ? "  | " She was done married , " Sam said gravely . " She and her husband were young and miserable with one another , but so many young married folks are that way that I figured they 'd work out of it in time . I thought they 'd get comfortable when they got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is growin ' up always miserable ? " Sonny said . " Nobodyseems to enjoy it much . " " Oh , it ai n't necessarily miserable , " Sam replied . " About eighty per cent of the time , I guess . " They were silent again , Sam the Lion thinking of the lovely , spritely girl he had once led into the water , right there , where they were sitting . " We ought to go to a real fishin ' tank next year , " Sam said finally . " It do n't do to think about things like that too much . If she was here now I 'd probably be crazy agin in about five minutes . Ai n't that ridiculous ? " A half-hour later , when they had gathered up the gear and were on the way to town , he answered his own question . " It ai n't , really , " he said . " Being crazy about a woman like her 's always the right thing to do . Being a decrepit old bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rained the week before and there were deep ruts in the dirt road . Sonny drove as carefully as he could , but Sam the Lion scratched his head and watched the speedometer nervously , convinced that they were proceedingat a reckless speed . " Did you know about me and Mrs. Popper ? " Sonny asked suddenly , feeling that if he was ever going to talk about it the time was at hand . " Yeah , how is Ruth ? " Sam asked . " I have n't had a close look at her in years . " " Sometimes she 's okay , " Sonny said . " Sometimes she does n't seem to be too happy . " Sam snorted . " That 's probably the understatementp155of the day , " he said . " I figured her for a suicide ten years ago  --  people are always turning out to be tougher than I think they are . " " I do n't exactly know what to do about her , " Sonny said hopefully . Sam the Lion laughed almost as loudly as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me for advice , " he said . " I never know exactly what to do about anybody , least of all women . You might stay with her and get some good out of her while you 're growing up . Somebody ought to get some good out of Ruth . " They pulled onto the highway and in a few minutes the fenceposts were going by so fast that Sam the Lion could hardly see them . He breathed as little as possible until they hit the city limits sign  --  then Sonny slowed down and he relaxed . " Say , was Duane along that night you all got Billy in the mess ? " he asked . " I 've been wondering about that lately . " Sonny was caught off guard and was completely at a loss to answer . He automatically started to lie , but because it was Sam the Lion the lie would n't come out . He decidedit would n't hurt to tell the truth , but the truth would n't come out either . First the lie and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same place . " I see , " Sam said . " Watch out , that 's Old Lady Peters backing out of her driveway up there . She thinks it 's still 1930 an ' she 's just as apt to back right in front of you as not . " He gripped the door handle tightly , prepared to leap out if necessary , but Sonny had seen the old lady blocks before he had and calmly , out of habit , swerved wide around her and coasted them safely up to the poolhall door.  |p157THREE  DAYS AFTER the fishing trip , Duane got so frustrated that he beat up Lester Marlow . Jacy and Lester had gone to Wichita together three Saturday nights in a row , and Duane could stand it no longer . " I do n't care if it ai n't Lester 's fault , " Duane told Sonny . " Maybe if he has a couple of front teeth missin ' Mrs. Farrow wo n't be so anxious to have Jacy go with him . " Sam the Lion overheard the remark and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that sort of reasonin ' is Lester 's dentist , " he said . " Maybe Jacy likes to go with Lester . " That was an incredible thing to suggest . Duane and Sonny were both flabbergasted . " You do n't think she wants to go with that fart , do you ? " Duane asked indignantly . " Well , Lester ai n't entirely unlikable , " Sam replied , not at all flustered . " I do n't know Jacy well enough to know what she wants , but you 've been blaming her mother all this time for something that might not be her mother 's fault . If I was you I 'd investigate . " Duane stormed out of the poolhall , mad as he could be . He did n't want to investigate , he just wanted to whip Lester , and about midnight that night , as Lester was passingthe courthouse , Duane waved him down . Sonny was the only other person to see it.  | " I know you 're mad , " Lester said , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need n't be . All I 've done is take her to dances . I 've never even kissed her . " It was a shameful admission , but true : Jacy gave Lester absolutely nothing in the way of intimacies . She did n't have to . " You took her to a naked swimming party , " Duane said . " Do n't tell me you did n't kiss her . " " I did n't , " Lester said , but at that point Duane hit him on the mouth . Lester swung a half-hearted blow in return and found himself sitting down  --  at least he found himself getting up , and he could only assume he had been knocked down first . The fight was well started and things were easier for him : he could n't feel himself being hit , and after three or four more licks Duane bloodied his nose and stopped fighting . " That 's just a taste , " he said . " Do n't you take ' her anywhere else ! " Lester said nothing , and Duane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumph , Lester thought . He had made no promises . He went across the street to the filling station and ran some water on his nose , thinking that in a way he had been ganged up on . Sonny had been there . It could even have been that he was not knocked down fairly  --  Sonny could have tripped him . On the way back to Wichita he concluded that Sonny probably did trip him , and instead of going to his home he drove out to a place on Holiday Creek where some of the wilder boys often gathered on Saturday nights . A lot of boys were there , sitting on the fenders of their cars drinking beer , and when they saw how bloody Lester was they were briefly impressed . What happened ? they wanted to know . " Couple of roughnecks beat me up , " Lester said stoically . " You know , Crawford and Moore , over in Thalia.  |p159It  was about Jacy Farrow . I would have done okay if one of them had n't tripped me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We ought to go over there and pile their asses . " " No , " Lester said gallantly . " I do n't want anybody fighting my fights . " " Aw , hell , it 'd be somethin ' to do , " a boy said . " Besideswe can get the Bunne brothers to do the fighting . " The Bunne brothers were local Golden Gloves champions , a welter weight and a light-heavy . They enjoyed fighting , in the ring or out . Lester did n't try again to discourage them , but for himself he decided it would be best not to go back to Thalia . The boys took that in stride  --  they did n't really like Lester much and were just as glad he stayed in Wichita . The nice thing about his getting beat up was that it gave them an excuse to drive to Thalia and watch a fight . The Bunne brothers were located at a Pioneer drivein , trying to make some girls in a green Pontiac . The welter weight was named Mickey , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to go fighting : the girls were just a bunch of pimply virgins who had run off from a slumber party in Burkburnett . A couple of boys elected to stay and work on them , but that still left seven raring to go . They piled in a second-hand Mercury and headed for Thalia , driving about eighty-five and laughing and talking . Saturday night had taken a turn for the better . After the fight with Lester , Sonny and Duane walked over to the cafe to have a cheeseburger . Duane really wanted sympathy , but Genevieve was not inclined to give him any . " No sir , " she said . " There was n't any point in your bullyin ' Lester  --  it ai n't his fault you ca n't make your girl friend behave . "  | " You 're as bad as Sam , " Duane said bitterly . " Why Jacy would marry me tonight , if she had the chance . " Sonny got up and put a couple of nickels in the jukebox , hoping a little music would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , so after a few minutes the boys left and drove out to the Y , a fork in the road about five miles from town . The fork was on top of a hill , and when they got there they sat and looked across the flat at the cluster of lights that was Thalia . In the deep spring darkness the lights shone very clear . The windows of the pickup were down and they could smell the fresh smell of the pastures . They only sat a few minutes , and then drove back to town . When they pulled up at the rooming house the Wichita boys were there , sitting on the fenders of the Mercury . " There 's the Bunne brothers , " Duane said . " That damn Lester must have sent ' em . " Both of them were badly scared , but they did n't want the Wichita boys to know that so they got out as if nothing were wrong . For a moment no one said anything . Sonny nervously scraped his sole on the pavement and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunne came cockily over and broke the silence . " Hear you men beat the piss out of Lester , " he said . " I beat the piss out of him , " Duane said quickly . " Sonny was n't involved . " " That ai n't the way Lester tells it . " The other boys got off the fenders and began to edge around . " He probably lied about it , " Duane said . " I did n't hit him over five times , anyway . I told him to stop going with my girl . " Mickey moved a step closer . " He said you both whipped him . "  | " You do n't really think it would take two of us to whip Lester , do you ? " Sonny asked . " All he had was a bloody nose and a busted lip . If we 'd both fought he would n't have been able to drive home , much less tell lies about it . " The Wichita boys were momentarily silent , even Mickey . What Sonny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whip Lester Marlow , and he had n't been damaged much , anyway . Most of the boys did n't feel particularly unfriendly to Duane and Sonny , but that did n't matter . There had to be a fight . The Bunne brotherswould n't go home without a fight . Fortunately Mickey Bunne was quick-witted and saw right away what tack to take . " Who whipped him do n't matter , " he said . " We do n't like you country boys tellin ' us who to go with and who to leave alone . We like to screw country girls once in a while . " Duane was getting a little nervous . " I did n't tell him not to screw country girls , " he said . " I told him not to bother Jacy . He can fuck the whole rest of this town for all I care  --  I 'm just tired of him botherin ' Jacy . " Mickey grinned . " Lester do n't bother her , " he said . " She laps it up . I seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ai n't bad lookin ' . Who she really likes is Bobby Sheen  --  him and her played around all one night . I guess she 's about as much ours as she is yours . I may want to go with her myself some time , you ca n't tell . " That was too much for Duane : he hit at Mickey , and the fight was on . It was not too bad for Duane , although Mickey beat him handily and knocked him down once . Duane was so mad he did n't really feel the pounding he took . He was fighting for his girl , after all . Sonny was the one who suffered most . He was n't mad at all , and he was n't fighting for anyone in particular . Besides that , hep162did n't like to fight and did n't know how , whereas Jack Bunne liked it and knew how very well . It made for a painful beating . Fortunately the Bunne brothers knew when to quit . They were not looking for trouble , just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit , although Sonny wanted very much to sit down . He had a pain in his ribs . " Well let 's go , men , " one of the boys said . " The deputy sheriff 's liable to come drivin ' by . " " We ai n't broke no laws , " Jack Bunne said , not even winded , but the boys all went on and piled in the Mercury . They whooped and laughed as the car pulled away . " Motherfuckers , " Duane said wearily . Sonny walked over and sat down on the curb . One of his ears was paining him severely , and he had caught at least a couple of hard licks in the rib cage . Duane came and sat down too . They were both too winded and depressedto say anything . It was enough just to sit . The town was very quiet . From the west , far out in the pastures , they , heard some hounds , so far away that their braying sounded as thin as the yapping of puppies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace , " Duane said . " I 'm sick of this town . You 're the only friend I got here , except Jacy . " " You mean go and stay gone ? " Sonny asked . " No , just for a day or two . We could go to Mexico and get back by sometime Monday . " " Reckon the pickup would make it ? " Sonny asked , welcoming the prospect . They got out their billfolds and counted their money . Saturday had been payday , and between them they had almost a hundred dollars . " We can make it on that , " Duane said . " Let 's go clean up . " A few minutes later Sonny vomited all over the bath/room , but once he got the mess cleaned up he felt much better . His ear was not throbbing so badly . They put on clean Levi 's and shirts and doctored themselves with aspirin , convinced they would both survive . The pickup did n't have much gas in it and they had to stop in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the gas stations . " Why you boys or-tant to go all that way , " Andy said cheerfully . " The water 's buggy in Mexico . " " We 'll just drink beer and tequila , " Duane said . " You need-ernt to tell me , " Andy said sagely . " I been there . You get the clap you 'll wish you had n't drunk nothin ' . Where you goin ' , Laredo ? " The boys looked at one another . They had n't planned that far ahead ; they were just going to Mexico . " Which is the best place ? " Sonny asked . Andy was n't positive and he did n't have a map , so they went back to the cafe and got one out of the glove compartment of Genevieve 's old Dodge . They took it inside to read it . " Good lord , " Genevieve said , when she saw their skinned-up faces . They explained , and she sat down in a booth with them . " You all can just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going far enough away that I need to worry about getting lost , I do n't guess . " " Let 's go all the way to Matamoros , since we 're goin ' , " Duane suggested . " I 've heard it 's about the wildest . " " Matamoros suits me , " Sonny said , gulping his coffee . They could hardly believe such an adventure was before them , and they wanted to get away before something happened to stop it . Genevieve , however , was a little dubious . She followed them out to the pickup to see them off . The streets were empty , the streetlights shining palely . The stoplight blinked red and green all to itself . " This pickup do n't look so good , " she said . The boysp164were so eager that it made her strangely sad . " Have either of you ever been that far away before ? " " Austin 's the farthest I 've been , " Sonny said . It was the same with Duane , and Matamoros was almost twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager , but to their amazement Genevieve suddenly began to cry about something , right there on the street . Sonny had been just about to start the motor when she put her elbows on the pickup window and wiped away the tears with her hand . Both boys were stricken , afraid they were going to miss the trip after all . " Why do n't you boys take my car ? " Genevieve sniffed . " You 'll never make it in this old pickup . " They were astonished . It was an unprecedented offer . Women were clearly beyond all understanding . " Naw , we better go in this one , " Sonny told her softly . She was looking off down the street  --  he had never noticed before , but she seemed lonesome . " We might wreck yours , an ' then where would we be ? " he added . " Okay , " Genevieve said , hardly paying attention . Something made her breasts ache . " Wait just a minute . " She went in the cafe and got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wiped her eyes with a Kleenex she took the money outside and handed it to Sonny . " Hide that somewhere , " she said . " Use it when you do n't have anything else to use . I 'd like for you to get back in time for your graduation . " Both boys assured her that the money was quite unnecessary , but she pressed it on them anyway . " Sam 's up there sitting on the curb , " she said . " Guess he ca n't sleep . You might go say good-bye to him . " The boys were glad of anything that would prolong the ecstasy of departure a few more minutes . Sonny backed solemnly into the empty street and turned toward the poolhall . Sam the Lion was sitting on the curb , scratchingp165his ankles . Sonny drove right up in front of him and leaned out the window . " Better come go with us , " he said . " We 're headed for the Valley . " Astonished , Sam got up from the curb and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously . " Going to the Valley tonight , " he said . " My God . " He was touched by the folly of youth and stood with his foot on the running board a moment . I guess the town can get along without us till Monday , " Sonny said . " I reckon , " Sam said lightly . " If I was young enough to bounce that far I 'd go with you . Need any money ? " " No . We got plenty . " " You ca n't tell , " Sam said , fishing out his billfold . " Better take ten dollars for insurance . They say money kinda melts when you take it across a border . " The boys were too embarrassed to tell Sam that Genevieve had given them some already . They took the bill guiltily , anxious to be off . Sam stepped back to the curb and the boys waved and made a wide U-turn in the empty street . Genevieve was still outside the cafe and they waved at her too as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they got to the stoplight it was red and they stopped , even though there was n't another moving car within fifteen miles of them . The light winked green and the pickup turned the corner and sped out of sight . Genevieve went over and kicked lightly at the front tire of her Dodge  --  to her the tire always looked low . The boys had made her remember what it was to be young . Once , before they had any kids , she and her husband Dan took off one weekend and drove to Raton , New Mexico . They stayed in a motel , lost twenty dollars at the horse races , made love six times in two days , and had dinner in the coffee shop of a fancy restaurant . She had even wornp166eye shadow . Romance might not last , but it was something while it did . She looked up the street and waved at Sam the Lion , but he was looking the other way and did n't notice her and she went back into the empty cafe , wishing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could go rattling off across Texas toward the Rio Grande.  |p167ALL  DAY THE boys alternated , one driving the other sleeping , and by late evening they were in the Valley , driving between the green orange groves . It was amazing how different the world was , once the plains were left behind . In the Valley there were even palm trees . The sky was violet , and dusk lingered until they were almost to Matamoros . Every few miles they passed roadside groceries , lit with yellow light bulbs and crowded with tables piled high with corn and squash , cabbages and tomatoes . " This is a crazy place , " Duane said . " Who you reckon eats all that squash ? " They drove straight on through Brownsville and paid a fat , bored tollhouse keeper twenty cents so they could drive across the bridge . Below them was the Rio Grande , a river they had heard about all their lives . Its waters were mostly dark , touched only here and there by the yellow bridge lights . Several Mexican boys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spitting into the water and chattering to one another . A few blocks from the bridge they came to a stoplighton a pole , with four or five boys squatting by it . Apparently someone had run into the light pole because it was leaning away from the street at a forty-five degree angle . As soon as Sonny stopped one of the boys ran out and jumped lightly onto the running board.  | " Girl ? " he said . " Boy 's Town ? Dirty movie ? " " Well , I guess , " Sonny said . " I guess , " Sonny said . " I guess that 's what we came for . " The boy quickly got in the cab and began to chatter directions in Tex-Mex  --  Sonny followed them as best he could . They soon left the boulevard and got into some of the narrowest streets the boys had ever seen . Barefooted kids and cats and dogs were playing in the street , night or no night , and they moved aside for the pickup very reluctantly . A smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets went every which direction . There were lots of intersections but no stop signs  --  apparently the right of way belonged to the driver with the most nerve . Sonny kept stopping at the intersections , but that was a reversal of local custom : most drivers beeped their horns and speeded up , hoping to dart through before anyone could hit them . Mexico was more different from Thalia than either of the boys would have believed . The number of people who went about at night was amazing to them . In Thalia three or four boys on the courthouse square constituted a lively crowd , but the streets of Matamoros teemed with people . Groups of men stood on what , in Thalia , would have been sidewalks , children rushed about in the dust , and old men sat against buildings . Their guide finally ordered them to stop in front of a dark lump that was apparently some sort of dwelling . " This could n't be no whorehouse , " Duane said . " It ai n't big enough to have a whore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out and followed their guide to the door . A paunchy Mexican in his undershirt and khakis opened it and grunted at the guide . " Ees got movies , " the boy said . They all went inside , into a bedroom . Through an open doorway the boys could see an old woman stirring something in a pot , onions and tomatoes it smelled like.  |p169An  old man with no shirt on and white hair on his chest sat at a table staring at some dominoes . Neither the old man nor old woman so much as glanced at the boys . There were two beds in the bedroom and on one of them three little Mexican boys were curled up , asleep . Sonny felt strange when he saw them . They looked very helpless , and he could not feel it was very polite for Duane and him to barge into their room . The paunchy man immediately brought up the subject of movies . " Ten dollars , " he said . " Got all kinds . " He knelt and drew a tiny little projector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-millimeter film out of a little bureau . The boys looked uncomfortablyat one another . They either had to pay and watch the movies or else refuse and leave , and since they had driven five hundred miles to see some wickedness it was pointless to refuse . Duane handed over a ten dollar bill and the man stuffed it in his pocket and calmly began to clear one of the beds . He picked the sleeping boys up one at a time , carried them into the kitchen , and deposited them under the table where the old man sat . The little boys moaned a little and stirred in their sleep , but they did n't wake up . The paunchy man then put the projector on their bed and prepared to show the movies on a sheet hung against the opposite wall . " I do n't like this , " Sonny said , appalled . " I never come all this way just to get some kids out of bed . If he ai n't got a better place than this to show them I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same mind , but when they tried to explain themselves , the guide and the projectionist both seemed puzzled . " Ees okay , " the guide said . " Sleepin ' away . " He gestured at the three little boys , all of whom were sound asleep on the dirt floor . Sonny and Duane were stubborn . Even though thep170little boys were asleep , it would n't do : they could n't enjoy a dirty movie so long as they were in sight of the displaced kids . Finally the projectionist shrugged , picked up the projector , and led them back through the hot kitchen and across an alley . The guide followed , carrying the film . Above them the sky was dark and the stars very bright . They came to what seemed to be a sort of long outhouse , and when the guide knocked a thin , middle-aged man opened the door . He had only one leg , but no crutch , the room being so small that he could easily hop from one resting place to the next . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would cost them five dollars more because of the change of rooms : the oneleggedman could not be put to the trouble of sitting through a pornographic movie for nothing . Sonny paid it and the projectionist plugged the projector into a light socket . An old American calendar hung on the door , a picture of a girl in mechanic 's overalls on the front of it . The one-legged man simply turned the calendar around and they had a screen . " You mean they 're going to show it on the back of a calendar , " Duane said . " For fifteen dollars ? " The light was turned off and the projector began to buzz  --  the title of the picture was Man 's Best Friend . It was clearly an old picture , because the lady who came on the screen was dressed like ladies in Laurel and Hardy movies . The similarity was so strong that for a moment the boys expected Laurel and Hardy to come on the screen and do dirty things to her . As the plot unfolded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded ; soon it was barely possible to tell that the figures on the screen were human . The boys leaned forward to get a better look and were amazed to discover that the figures on the screen were n't all human . One of the actors was a German shepherd dog . " My God , " Duane said.  |p171They  both immediately felt the trip was worthwhile , if only for the gossip value . Nobody in Thalia had ever seen a dog and a lady behaving that way : clearly it was the ultimate depravity , even more depraved than having congress with Negro whores . They were speechless . A man came on and replaced the dog , and then the dog came back on and he and the man teamed up . The projectionist and the guide chuckled with delight at this development , but the boys were too surprised to do anything but watch . The ugliness of it all held them spellbound . When it was over they walked to the pickup in silence , followed by the guide and the projectionist . The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Got French , Gypsy , Chinese lesbian , all kinds . Five dollars a reel from now on . " The boys shook their heads . They wanted to get away and think . The guide shrugged and climbed in beside them and they drove away , leaving the fat man in the middle of the road . " I hope he puts them kids back in bed , " Sonny commented . " Boy 's Town now , " the guide said happily . " Five hundredgirls there . Clean , too . " They soon left the downtown area and bumped off toward the outskirts of Matamoros . A red Chevrolet with Texas license plates was just in front of them , throwing the white dust of the dirt road up into their headlights . Soon they saw Boy 's Town , the neon lights from the larger cabarets winking red and green against the night . At first it looked like there were a hundred clubs , but after they drove around a while they saw that there were only fifteen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners were dark , unlit rows of cribs . The guide gestured contemptuously at the cribs and took them to a place called the Cabaret ZeeZee . When the boys parked , a fat policeman in khakis walked up and offered to openp172the door for them , but the guide chattered insultingly to him and he shrugged lazily and turned away . The boys entered the cabaret timidly , expecting to be mobbed at once by whores or else slugged by Mexican gangsters , but neither thing happened . They were simply ignored . There was a large jukebox and a few couples dancing , but most of the people in the club were Americanboys , sitting around tables . " The competition 's gon na be worse here than it is in Thalia , " Duane said . " We might as well get some beer . " They sat down at one of the tile-topped tables and waited several minutes before a waitress came over and got their order . She brought them the first Mexican beer they had ever tasted , and they drank the first bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly took effect  --  before they knew it they had had five bottles apiece , and the fatigue of the trip seemed to be dropping away . A fat-faced girl in a green blouse came over , introduced herself as Juanita , and with no further preamble squeezed Sonny intimately through his blue jeans . He was amazed . Though responsive , he felt the evening would bring better things than Juanita , so he politely demurred . Juanita went around and squeezed Duane the same way , but got the same reply . " Texas ees full of queers , " she said , swishing her buttocks derogatorily as she walked away . The boys contemplatedthemselves over the beer bottles , wondering if they had been seriously insulted . As the night wore on Sonny gradually set his mind on a slim , black-headed girl who spent most of her time on the dance floor , dancing with boys from Texas A &; M. There were a good many boys from Texas A &; M in the cabaret . " I thought Aggies was all irrestible cocksmen , " Duane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a whorehouse ? " In time Sonny approached the girl , whose name wasp173Maria . She cheerfully came to the table with hire and downed three whiskeys while he was having a final beer . Between drinks she blew her warm , slightly sticky breath in his ear and squeezed him the way Juanita had . " All night party ? " she asked . " Jus ' tweenty-five dollars . We can leef right now . " It seemed ungallant to haggle with such a confident girl , so Sonny agreed . It turned out he owed eight dollars for the drinks , but it did n't seem gallant to haggle about that either . He paid , and Maria led him out the back door of the Cabaret ZeeZee into a very dark alley , where the only light was from the bright stars far above . The place she took him did n't even have a door , just a blue curtain with a light behind it . The room was extremely tiny . The one light bulb was in a socket on the wall and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thin green bedspread . In the room , Maria seemed less perky than she had in the club . She looked younger than she had inside . Sonny watched her unzip her dress  --  her back was brown and smooth , but when she turned to face him he was really surprised . Her breasts were heavy , her nipples large and purplish , and she was clearly pregnant . He had never seen a pregnant woman naked before , but he knew from the heavy bulge of her abdomen that she must be carrying a child . She tried to look at him with whorish gaiety , but somehow it did n't work : the smile was without life , and showed her gums . When he was undressed she splashed him with coolish water from a brown pitcher , and scrutinizedhim with such care that an old worry popped into his mind . Perhaps his equipment was too small ? He had worried about that when he first began to go with Ruth , and had even tried to find out how large one 's equipment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the high-school library were the World Book and the Texas Almanac , neither of which had anything helpful onp174penises . Gradually it had ceased to worry him , but with Maria he had begun to feel generally hesitant . " But are n't you going to have a baby ? " he asked , not sure that the question was proper . Maria nodded . " Two already , " she said , meaning to reassure him . Her heavy breasts and large grape-colored nipples were not at all congruous with her thin calves and girlish shoulders . Sonny lay down with her on the cot , but he knew even before he began that somehow twenty-five dollars had been lost . He did n't want to stay in the room all night , or even very much of it . Two minutes later it came home to him why Ruth had insisted they make love on the floor : the cot springs wailed and screamed , and the sound made him feel as though every move he made was sinful . He had driven five hundred miles to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , made him feel exposed . Everyonein town would know that he had done it with a pregnantwhore . Suddenly he ceased to care about the twentyfivedollars , or about anything ; the fatigues of the long trip , down from the plains , through the hill country and the brush country , through Austin and San Antone , five hundred miles of it all pressed against the backs of his legs and up his body , too heavy to support . To Maria 's amazement he simply stopped and went to sleep . When he awoke , he was very hot . The green counterpanewas soaked with his sweat . It was not until he hadbeen awake a minute or two that he realized the sun wasshining in his face . He was still in the room where Mariahad brought him , but the room had no roof  --  the nightbefore he had not even noticed . It was just an open crib . He hurriedly got up and put on his clothes , his headaching . While he was tieing his shoes he suddenly had tovomit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he had finished vomiting and was kneeling in the white dust waiting for his strength to come back he heard a slow clop-clop and looked up to see a strange wagon rounding the corner into his part of the street . It was a water wagon , drawn by a decrepit brown mule and driven by an old man . The wagon was entirely filled by a large rubber water tank wrapped in ragged canvas ; as the wagon moved the water sloshed out of the open tank and dripped down the sides of the wagon into the white dust . The old man wore a straw hat so old that it had turned brown . His grizzled whiskers were as white as Sam the Lion 's hair . As he stopped the mule , three or four whores stepped out of their cribs with water pitchers in their hands . One passed right by Sonny , a heavy woman with a relaxed face and large white breasts that almost spilled out of her green robe . The whores were barefootedand seemed much happier than they had seemed the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wagon to get their water . The old man spoke to them cheerfully , and when the first group had filled their pitchers he popped the mule lightly with the rein and proceeded up the street , the slow clop-clop of the mule 's feet very loud in the still morning . When he passed where Sonny was kneeling the old man nodded to him kindly and gestured with a tin dipper he had in his hand . Sonny gratefully took a dipper of water from him , using it to wash the sour taste out of his mouth . The old man smiled at him sympathetically and said something in a philosophic tone , something which Sonny took to mean that life was a matter of ups and downs . He stayed where he was and watched the wagon until it rounded the next corner . As it moved slowly up the street the whores of Matamoros came out of their cribs , some of them combing their black hair , some with white bosoms uncovered , all with brown pitchers in their hands and coins for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pickup , his legs sticking out the window . Three little boys were playing in the road , trying to lead a dusty white goat across into a pasture of scraggly mesquite . The goat apparentlywanted to go into the Cabaret ZeeZee . A depressedlooking spotted dog followed behind the boys and occasionally yapped discouragedly at the goat . Duane was too bleary and sick to do more than grunt . His hair was plastered to his temples with sweat . " You drive , " he said . By some miracle Sonny managed to wind his way through Matamoros to the Rio Grande  --  in daylight the water in the river was green . The boys stood groggily under the custom 's shed for a few minutes , wondering why in the world they had been so foolish as to come all the way to Mexico . Thalia seemed an impossible distance away . " I do n't know if I can make it , " Sonny said . " How much money we got ? " They found , to their dismay , that their money had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the money that Sam and Genevieve had given them , hidden in the seat springs , but they had not planned to use that . " I guess we can pay them back in a week or two , " Sonny said . " We 'll have to use it . " When the customs men were through the boys got back in the pickup and drove slowly out of Brownsville , along the Valley highway . Heat waves shimmered above the green cabbage fields . Despite the sun and heat Duane soon went to sleep again and slept heavily , wallowing in his own sweat . Sonny drove automatically ; he was depressed , but not exactly sleepy , and he paced himself from town to town , not daring to think any farther ahead than the next city limits sign.  |p177Soon  the thought of Ruth began to bother him . In retrospect it seemed incredibly foolish that he should drive a thousand miles to go to sleep on a pregnant girl 's stomach , when any afternoon he could have a much better time with Ruth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands suddenly made him very horny and even more depressedwith himself . It occurred to him that he might even be diseased , and he stopped in a filling station in Alice to inspect himself . Duane woke up and exhibited similar anxieties . For the rest of the day they stopped and peed every fifty miles , just to be sure they could . There was money enough for gas , but not much for food , so they managed on Cokes , peanuts , and a couple of candy bars . Evening finally came , coolness with it , and the boys got a second wind . The trip ceased to seem like such a fiasco : after all , they had been to Mexico , visited whorehouses , seen dirty movies . In Thalia it would be regarded as a great adventure , and they could hardly wait to tell about it . The country around Thalia had never looked so good to them as it did when they came back into it , at four in the morning . The dark pastures , the farmhouses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road in front of them , all seemed comfortable , familiar , private even , part of what was theirs and no one else 's . After the strangeness of Matamoros the lights of Thalia were especially reassuring . Duane was driving when they pulled in . He whipped through the red light and turned toward the cafe . Genevievewould be glad to see they were safely back . To their astonishment , the cafe was dark . No one at all was there . The cafe had never been closed , not even on Christmas , and the boys were stunned . Inside , one little light behind the counter shone on the aspirin , the coughdrops , the chewing gum , and cheap cigars . " It ai n't a holiday , is it ? " Sonny said.  |p178There  was nothing to do but go over to the courthouseand wake up Andy Fanner  --  he would know what had happened . Andy woke up hard , but they kept at him and he finally got out of the car and rubbed his stubbly jaw , trying to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all been gone , ai n't you , " he said . " Gone to Mexico . You do n't know about it . Sam the Lion died yesterday mornin ' . " " Died ? " Sonny said . After a moment he walked over to the curb in front of the courthouse and sat down . The traffic light blinked red and green over the empty street . Andy came over to the curb too , yawning and rubbing the back of his neck . " Yep , " he said . " Quite a blow . Keeled over on one of the snooker tables . Had a stroke . " Soon it was dawn , a cool , dewy spring dawn that wet the courthouse grass and left a low white mist on the pastures for the sun to burn away . Andy sat on the fender of his Nash and told all about the death and how everybody had taken it , who had cried and who had n't . " Good thing you all got back today , you 'd ' a missed the funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Sonny could not have told himl ; he had lost track of things and just wanted to sit on the curb and watch the traffic light change.  |p179SONNY  WAS EMBARRASSED that he did n't have a suit to wear to the funeral  --  all he had was a pair of slacks and a blue sports coat that was too short at the wrists . No one seemed to notice , though . The graveyard was on a rough , gravelly hill , where the wind was always blowing . Sonny was able to quit being embarrassed because of Mrs. Farrow , who cried all through the graveyard ceremonies . She stood at the edge of the crowd , the wind blowing her long hair , and her cheeks wet ; when she walked back to her Cadillac to drive away she was still crying and wiping her eyes with her gloves . It was because of her crying so much that Sonny learned she had been the woman who watched Sam the Lion piss off the tank dam . That night at the cafe Sonny asked Genevieve about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone and Lois never cared who knew , " she said . " Everybody knew but Gene . She and Sam carried on for quite a while . Lois was just crazy about him . She would have married him , old as he was , but he would n't let her leave Gene . " A few weeks before Sonny would not have believed it , but the world had become so strange that he could believe anything . Genevieve was wiping the counter with a gray washrag . " Sam was quite a man , you know , " she said . " Andp180Lois was just beautiful when she was young  --  I always envied her her looks . She was prettier than her daughter ever will be , and nine times as wild . She had more life than just about anybody in this town . " Sonny did n't tell her about the bet at the tank dam , but he thought about it a lot , just as he thought about many of the things Sam the Lion had done . Some of them were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He left the poolhall to Sonny and Billy ; he left the picture show to Old Lady Mosey and her nephew Junior Mosey , who was the projectionist ; he left the cafe to Genevieve , five thousand dollars to the county swimming-pool fund , and strangest of all , a thousand dollars to Joe Bob Blanton . No one knew what to make of it , not even Joe Bob . People thought it was a damned outrage , but that was what the will said . Two weeks after the funeral the seniors left for San Francisco , on their senior trip . Sonny was glad to go . It seemed to him he had jumped up and gone to Mexico on the spur of the moment and had never quite managed to get hack to Thalia , really . The town had become strange to him , and he thought it might be easier to return to it from San Francisco . The bus left Thalia at midnight and when dawn came was crossing the Pecos River , a dry winding rut cutting through the naked flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night and worn themselves out , but Sonny was awake , and just tired enough that his memory could do what it pleased . The sky was completely cloudless , a round white moon hanging in it . He had not thought of Sam the Lion much since the funeral  --  in Thalia it was no good thinking about him  --  hut for some reason the bitter flats of the Pecos brought him to mind and Sonny remembered the way he used to slop around the poolhall in his house shoes , complaining about the ingrown toenail that had pained him for years . A bronc had stomped onp181his foot once , and the toenail had never recovered . Sam the Lion , the horsebreaker , pissing off the tank clam while Lois Farrow watched  --  it was too much to be thinking about on the way to San Francisco , and his eyes kept leakingtears all the way to Van Horn . They got to San Francisco in the middle of the night and checked into an expensive cheap motel on Van Ness Avenue , not far from the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thing they were going to do , and all the boys were itching to go bowling or find whores . The first day there the room mothers kept them all herded together and saw to it that they rode a cable car , visited the Top of the Mark , and went across the Golden Gate bridge . All the Californians looked at them as if they were freaks , whereas it seemed to the kids it was the other way around . The room mothers were scandalized by the numberof bars in the city and kept everyone in a tight group to protect them against lurking perverts . The second day was unscheduled and most of the boys spent it on Market Street , looking at dirty magazines and talking to girls and sailors in the cheap sidewalk lunch counters . Sonny and three other boys wandered into a bar between Market and Mission and were met by a tall blackheadedgirl named Gloria who offered to let them take pictures of her naked . The bar itself was plastered with pictures of Gloria naked , a great inducement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and none of the boys could afford it . The major event of the trip occurred on the afternoonof the second day in San Francisco when Jacy finally allowed Duane to seduce her . The girls were all supposed to accompany the room mothers to the De Young Museum that afternoon , but Jacy cleverly got out of it . She was rooming with an obliging little girl named Winnie Snips , and she got Winnie to tell the room mothers that she had taken to her bed with menstrual cramps . No one everp182doubted the word of Winnie Snips . She was valedictorian , and just unpopular enough that she was glad to do anythinganyone wanted of her . After the girls and the room mothers left , Sonny stationed himself in the lobby of the motel so he could give the alarm if the party got back early . It was an ugly lobby full of postcard racks and it depressed him a little to sit in it . The only senior who bothered with postcards was Charlene Duggs who sent about a dozen a day to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted everyone to know how much in love she was , but she did n't have much to say and just wrote " Gee , I miss you , Love and kisses , Charlene " on every card . When Sonny thought about Jacy he got even more depressed , but Duane was his friend and a scheme of such daring had to be supported . As it turned out , Sonny 's depression was nothing at all compared to the one Duane had to cope with in the seduction chamber upstairs . The glorious moment had arrived , and was going to be just perfect : they could even see the bay and a part of Alcatraz through the window " I love you , " Duane said , as soon as they had kissed a few times . " I love you too , " Jacy said , breathing heavily . It was the way things were done . Then she let Duane take absolutely all her clothes off , something she had never done before . For some reason , being naked with him was different than being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him looking right at the place between per legs , and that seemed rather discourteous . Still , there was no backing out , so she stretched out on the bed while Duane undressed . He had been in a state of anticipatory erection for at least half of the 1,800-mile drive , and could hardly wait to get his socks off . They kissed again for a moment , but both supposed speed to be of the essence and Duane soon rolled on top . Jacy sucked in her breath , pre/paring to be painfully devirginized . For a moment or two she did feel something that was hard and slightly painful , but it was n't nearly as painful as she had expected it to be and in a moment it ceased to be hard at all and became flexible and rather wiggly . It certainly was n't hurting her , but it was n't going in , either . It sort of tickled , and kept sliding off into her pubic hair . Curiosity got the better of her and she opened her eyes . Duane had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at himself , unable to believe his member should betray him  --  not then , of all times . " What 's wrong , honey ? " Jacy asked , wiggling slightly . She could n't stand to be tickled . " Um , " Duane said , a little choked . " I do n't know . " He held himself above her , embarrassed to death but hoping beyond hope that his body would come to its senses and enable him to go on . He hoped for two or three long minutes , while Jacy offered her intimate of intimates , but his body continued to register complete indifference . Duane did n't have the faintest idea what to do : no emergencyhad ever been more unlooked for . After a time Jacy felt a rising sense of exasperation . " Well get off a minute , " she said . " You might get tired and fall on me . " Duane complied , too disgraced to venture speech . He sat hopelessly on the edge of the bed , looking out at the bay . Jacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously they were faced with a crisis . The situation had to be salvaged or they would be the laughing stock of the class . Suddenly she felt furious with Duane . She looked with vexation at the offending organ . " It was Mexico , " she said . " I hate you . No tellin ' what you got down there . I do n't know why I ever went with you . " " I do n't know what happened , " Duane said glumly.  |p184He  got up and crept reluctantly back into his clothes , but Jacy stalked about the room , indignantly naked and not giving a damn . " What 'll we say , " she said . " The whole class knows what we were going to do . I just want to cry . I think you 're the meanest boy I ever saw and my mother was so right about you . " " I do n't know what happened , " Duane said again . He really did n't . He started for the door but Jacy stopped him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We have n't had time to do it  --  Sonny would know . I do n't want one soul to know . " Duane sat back down on the bed and Jacy went into the bathroom and cried a few real tears of anger . It seemed to her Duane had been a monster of thoughtlessness to put her in such a position . She did n't want to touch him again , ever , and it angered her to think she would have to go on pretending to be his sweetheart fpr the rest of the trip . It would never do to let the class think they had broken up over sex . In fact , she would have to be even more loving with him in public , so everyone would think they were having a warm , meaningful affair . When she thought they had been in the room long enough she went out and told Duane to leave . " You better not tell one soul , either , " she said . " You just pretend it was wonderful . And wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going someplace nice . " She stood naked , hands on hips , conscious that her nudity embarrassed Duane a little , and thoroughly pleased that it did . " Well , I 'm sorry , " he said again . " I do n't know what happened . " " If you say that one more time I 'll bite you , " Jacy said.  |p185When  Winnie Snips and the other girls piled into the room an hour later , pale with curiosity , Jacy was sitting in a well-rumpled bed with only her pajama tops on , staring out at the bay . The evening fog was coming in . " Oh gee , " Winnie said . " Tell us about it Jacy . What happened ? " Jacy looked langorously around at them , calm , replete , a little wasted even . " I just ca n't describe it , " she said . " I just ca n't describeit in words . " The very next day , to Duane 's immense relief , the seduction happened after all . Jacy insisted he take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be alone , and while they were walking down Geary Street , holding hands in case anyone from the class should see them , Duane suddenly felt himself return . They were just outside a cheap hotel , and without hesitation he seized his chance . " Come on , " he said . He had Jacy in the lobby of the hotel before she even knew what he meant . An old lady in a blue-flowered silk bathrobe registered them without comment and took five dollars from Duane . In the creaky cage of an elevator he kissed Jacy hungrily and fondled her breast , conscious that all was still well below . Jacy was skeptical and did n't return the kiss , but there was something rather adventurous about being fondled in an elevator  --  Winnie Snips would faint if she heard of such a thing . Their room was tiny , with green walls , an old fashionedbed , and a narrow window that looked across Geary Street to a one-story nightclub with a dead neon sign outside . Duane wasted absolutely no time  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his clothes by the time the door closed , and he tugged Jacy toward the bed , pulling rudely at her skirt . She shrugged loose and went to the window to undress at her own pace.  | " If you ca n't wait you can jump out this window , " she said . " I do n't think it will work anyway . " Duane was not certain it would either , and waited nervously . The room was chill and Jacy had goose bumps on her breasts . As she lay down she looked at Duane casually  --  men were certainly strange . All she really expectedwas something tickly , but Duane surprised her horribly . He did n't tickle a bit , but instead he did something really painful . At first she was too startled to move , and then she yelled out loud . Someone in an adjoining room kicked the wall indignantly . " Quit , quit , " she said  --  it was intolerable . Duane was much to thrilled to quit , but fortunatelyhe did n't take long . Jacy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got gingerly out of bed , meaning to take a hot bath , and discovered that the little room did n't even have a bathroom in it , just a lavatory . " There must be one down the hall someplace , " Duane said , but she would n't let him go look for it . She felt strange and wanted to leave . All the way back to the motel she kept glancing over her shoulder , expecting to see a trail of blood on the sidewalk behind her . Duane was walking happily along , infuriatinglyproud of himself . " Oh , quit prising , " Jacy said . " You need n't think I 'm going to take you back just because of that . I do n't think you did it right , anyway . " " Sure T did , " Duane said , but he was n't really positive , and he brooded about it during the remainder of the trip . They did it twice more , once in the motel in San Francisco and once icc Flagstaff , Arizona , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , but for some reason Jacy did n't swoon with bliss . She only allowed it twice more because she thought Bobby Sheen would like it if she had a little more experience . The whole business was far from delightful , but she supposed that was probablybecause Duane was a roughneck . In Flagstaff it wentp187on much too long and she got exasperated and told him off once and for all . " You never will learn , " she said . " I do n't know why I went with you so long . I guess we have to keep on being sweethearts until we get home , but that 's gon na be the end of it . We 'll just have to think of something big to break up over . " Duane just could n't understand it : he was more dejectedand more in love than he ever had been . Jacy was bending over to slip her small breasts back into their brassierecups ; she had never looked more lovely , and he could not believe she was serious about breaking up . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to the motel dressingtable and combed her hair thorougly , looking at herself in the mirror and paying absolutely no attention to him . The rest of the way home , across Arizona , New Mexico , Texas , he tried to think of ways to make her realize that they had to stay together . He was sure her disaffection would only be temporary . Jacy was thinking how glad she would be to get home . She had even decided there was no point in making a big production of breaking up : she was sick and tired of the seniors . As an audience they were not worth bothering about . When the bus finally pulled into Thalia late one June afternoon she did n't so much as tell Duane good-bye . She was tired and went right over to her parents ' Cadillac while her father got her bags . Lois was watching her shrewdly . " I see you got enough of him , " she said quietly . " That 's that . " " I 'm just not interested in saying one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacy said . Watching them drive away , Duane felt a little sick at his stomach . He realized Jacy had meant what she said : she was really done with him . It was very confusing to him because he had always thought you were supposedp188to get whoever you really loved . That was the way it worked in movies . It was all he could do to carry his suitcaseto the pickup . Sonny had merely endured the return trip , sitting in the back of the bus watching the desert go by . He had paid Duane and Jacy as little attention as possible , and it was not until he and Duane got in the pickup in Thalia that he noticed his friend was depressed . " What 's the matter ? " he asked , surprised . " Nothin ' , " Duane said . Sonny knew better . " Well what is it ? " he persisted . " You feel bad ? " For a moment Duane considered telling the truth , but then he decided not to . " I 'm worn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard on a person . " They were living over the poolhall , Billy with them , though Genevieve had kept him while the seniors were gone . Returning to the poolhall was a little strange , particularlysince Sam the Lion was n't there . If he had been there they would have shot some pool and had a great time telling him all about the trip . It would have picked everyone 's spirits up . As it was , the poolhall was quiet and empty , and there was not a great deal to do.  |p189WHILE  THE SENIORS were in California a great scandal rocked Thalia . All the mothers were agreed that it was the very worst thing that had ever happened in the town : John Cecil was fired from his teaching job for being a homosexual . The scariest thing of all , the mothers thought , was that it was just by a happenstance that he was found out . If it had n't been for Coach Popper 's vigilance and his interest in the welfare of the children , nobody would have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocents would have been exposed to corruption . The gist of the matter was that Mr. Cecil had persuadedBobby Logan to take a summer-school course in trigonometry , in Wichita Falls high school . Mr. Cecil was going to summer school himself , at the college there , so he drove Bobby over to his class every day . That seemingly innocent arrangement was enough to arouse the coach 's suspicions . He had been planning to have Bobby work out in the gym every day during the summer , so the would be in good shape when football season came . 1 t was a pleasure to work with a fine young athlete like Bobby , and when Bobby told him about the trigonometry class he was angered . " Why goddamn , " he said . " You mean you 're gonnap190sit in a damn schoolhouse all summer when you could be workin ' out ? What kinda shit is that ? " Bobby was a little embarrassed . " I 'll have to have trig to get in a good college , " he said . " Trig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get you a scholarship anywhere and you wo n't need to know a fuckin ' thing . " He raged on , but Bobby was determined , and that night , thinking it over , it came to the coach in a flash : Cecil was a queer . He did n't say anything to Ruth about it because it was n't a thing to talk to women about . The next morning he happened to be standing around the filling station and he mentioned his suspicion to some of the men . They were sitting on piles of old tires , chewing tobacco and discussing masculine matters , and all of them agreed with the coach right down the line . " Hell yes , " one said . " Whoever heard of a man teachin ' English . That 's a woman 's job . " " Ought a see the school board about it , " the coach said sternly . ' I he idea gut quick support . " By God , if you do n't I will , " Andy Fanner said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tell you , men , " the coach said , squaring his shoulders with purpose . " I hate to cost a man his job , but if there 's anything I hate it 's to see a goddamn homasexyulmessing arotincf with a bunch of young kids . I got too much respect for tile teach in ' profession to put up with that . " It turned out the coach did n't have to say a word to the school board . Sonic of the men went home and told their wives and the wives called the school board president even before they began to call one another . The school board president was a Pontiac salesman named Tom Todd . When Tom was fourteen years old he had been seducedp192one night at a family reunion by a male cousin from Jonesboro , Arkansas , and he had felt guilty about it ever since . He went right into action and that very night they got John Cecil before the board and fired him . All Mr. Cecil could say was that he had n't done anything to Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty looking though , and the board knew they had their man . They did n't question Bobby Logan because his father did n't want him to know what homosexuality was yet . If it had already happened to him his father preferred that he did n't realize it . Mr. Cecil went home and tried to explain to his wife what a terrible mistake had been made . " Why I 've never even touched one of my students , " he said . " Oh , they would n't have fired you if you had n't , " she said . Then she screamed and ran across to the neighbor'shouse and then screamed again and ran back and got the two girls . She did n't return that night , but the next morning she got some of her stuff and headed for Odessa in Mr. Cecil 's car . Her sisters lived in Odessa . Ruth Popper found out about it the night Mr. Cecil was fired . The coach was in an unusually good mood that night and was propped up in bed reading an old issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he had read at least fifty times . Ruth could not sleep with the light on , and was reading the Reader 's Digest . She lay flat on her back , and Herman noticed . " Prop up if you 're gon na read , " he said . " It ai n't good for your eyes to read laying down . " She obediently tucked a pillow under her head , and as she did , noticed that Herman was looking at her in a very satisfied way . Suddenly , to her complete surprise , he reached under the cover and rubbed her in rough , husbandlyfashion.  | " I guess tonight there 's a lot of women in this town glad they ai n't in Irene Cecil 's shoes , " he said . " I feel awful sorry for Irene . " " Why ? " Ruth asked . " I 've always felt a little sorry for John . " " You would , " the coach said , abruptly removing his hand . " I guess you 'd like to be married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me and some other fellers found out about him an ' took some action . He 'll never teach in this part of the country again . " Ruth did n't credit her hearing . " What did you say ? " she asked . " Why did n't you know it , honey , " he said , gruffly condescending . " I could tell that feller was queer as a three-dollar bill  --  been thinking it for years . Reason I never spoke up sooner was because I never noticed him actually botherin ' with any of the kids . When I saw he was after Bobby , I knew it was time to put a stop to it . That 's one boy I do n't intend to see messed up . " Ile farted gently into the sheets and went contentedly back to his fishing story . Ruth wanted not to be there ; not to be anywhere . She wanted to hug her knees with shame . Then gradually the shame was replaced by a dull , hot feeling inside her that soon filled her coniplctcly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken possession of her , and with no warning she swung her feet around in the bed and began to kick Herman furiously and as hard as she could . She kicked the magazine he held clear across the room and her bare heels caught hint iu the ribs and groin . The coach was so surprised lie did n't know what to do . He tried to catch her ankles but he could n't seem to and she continued to flail at him with her feet until he hastily got out and stood uncertainly by the bed , not sure what was happening to his wife.  | " Here , now , here , " he said . " You gone crazy ? What 's the matter with you ? " " You ! " Ruth yelled , sitting up in bed . She was beside herself and meant to pursue him out of the house . " You 're the matter , " she said , her voice shaking . " You fat . . . you fat ... " she did n't know what to call him . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You fat turd ! " she finished , a little lamely . The two of them were both stunned . Quiet fell on the room . Ruth was panting , but since the coach had got beyond the range of her heels she had lost the urge to chase him . He would have liked to sit back down on the bed , but Ruth looked too strange and dangerous for him to risk it . He knew it would mean a fight if he got near her , so he stood where he was and scratched himself nervously . He would never have believed his own wife could look so dangerous . " I never done nothin ' , " he said finally . " What if I did fart ? " It was the only thing he could think of that might have made her mad . " Oh , Herman , " Ruth said . Her legs were trembling and all the strength had gone out of her . " You got John Cecil fired . " " But he 's a goddamn queer , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then how about you ? " she said . " Who roomed with Bobby in Fort Worth , John or you ? You think I do n't know about things like that ? Now you 've ruined John 's life . " The coach 's mouth fell open . He felt tired and went over and sat down on the couch , fumbling with his undershirt . " Why Ruth , you do n't think nothin ' like that , " he said . " Nobody in this town would believe that . I 'm the football coach ! "  | " Do n't yell at me , " she said . " I know what you are . " Herman looked at her solemnly . " I sure do n't know what to think about a wife like you , " he said , not at all belligerent . " We 're even , " she said . " I do n't know what to think about a husband like you , either . Marriage is a bad joke , is n't it . " She saw that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean things , but she did n't really have the energy and it did n't seem worth doing . " What are we going to do ? " he asked . " You 're going to sleep on that couch from now on , " she said , throwing his pillow across the room . " Hell I am , " the coach said , getting up . " Hell I am . " But he picked up the pillow and stood holding it . " You are , " Ruth said , switching off the bedside light . " There 's some sheets in the bathroom . " " Goddacncnit , I ai n't gon na sleep on this couch , " Herman said . ' It 's gon na take more than your kicking to keep me out of my own bed . " " I 'll do whatever it takes , " Ruth said . " Maybe I 'll call the school hoard and get a few things off my chest . " Her calm voice infuriated the coach , but it frightened him , too . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell out of her , hilt instead he went and got some sheets and mule a bed on t he couch , feeling like a martyr . She did n't deserve it , hut the manly thing to do would be to give her a night to cool off . It seemed to him that his mother must have been the last good woman who had ever lived . The next day Ruth went to see John Cecil , hoping to comfort him . It occurred to her that he might be hungry , so she took what was left of a banana-nut cake she had baked the day before and walked over to the Cecils ' house . The porch was dusty and the morning paper layp195in the flower bed where the newspaperboy had thrown it . John took a long time to answer her knock . " Hello , John , " she said . " Can I come in ? " He looked tired and a little sick , and she felt silly for bringing the rich cake . He had on a long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cabinet , " she said awkwardly , moving past him with the cake . She got to the kitchen just in time to see a little pot of asparagus boil over  --  John had put too much water in the pot . " Oh , goodness , " he said . She turned the burner off and he sponged off the stove . Curiously , the event seemed to lift his spirits a little . " That 's exactly the kind of bachelor I make , " he said . He pulled up a kitchen chair for Ruth to sit in and they looked at one another directly for the first time since she had entered . " What are you going to do , John ? " she asked . He seemed such a kind man , and she realized at that moment that they had lived three blocks apart for fifteen years without really becoming friends . He shook his head , rubbing the back of his neck with both hands . " I 'll just have to do what I can for Irene and the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who runs an Indian reservation in New Mexico  --  maybe he 'll let me teach out there . If that do n't work out I guess I can go back to Plainview and work in my brother 's grocery store . When you 've messed up your life the way I 've messed up mine it does n't much matter . " " But you did n't mess it up , " Ruth said . " My husband messed it up . I 'll never forgive him for it . If anybody needed to be fired for . . . what they fired you for , it was him . " John Cecil looked at her with astonishment . " Oh ,  |p196you  do n't mean that , Ruth , " he said , after a moment . " Why Herman 's the football coach . " She saw that he did n't believe her , and knew that Herman had been right . Nobody , not even John Cecil , would believe her , and in truth she did n't even know for sure herself what Herman was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you 've even got two kids , " she said . " We do n't have any kids , and we never will . " John chuckled . " It 's kind of amazing to me that me and Irene had the girls , " he said . " I guess it just do n't take much enthusiasm for people to have two kids . " Suddenly Ruth wanted to be home , away from John Cecil . His sadness was so heavy that just being with him made her feel the weight , made her own limbs seem heavier . She made an excuse and left quickly , glad to be outside . The next day John Cecil left Thalia for good , to go back to Plainview to his brother 's grocery store . The job on the Indian reservation had n't worked out . When Sonny returned from the senior trip , Ruth and he discovered that they were famished for one another . The first afternoon he stayed so long that , while they were dressing , the coach 's pickup drove into the driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of for months , but just then they felt so calm and comfortable with one another that they were not even scared . Besides , the coach customarily spent ten or fifteen minutes carefully putting away his fishing equipment . Sonny quietly finished dressing and went in the living room , so he could go out the front door as the coach came in the back . Ruth , wearing only her panties , folded the quilt and took it to the cedar chest in the hall closet , where it was kept . She was still a little excited , still a little warm . She picked up her dress and went into the living room  --  the late sun was filtering through the Venetian blinds andp197Sonny was peeping out of one window , watching the garage . Ruth came up behind him , slipped her arm around his waist and rubbed his stomach . When he realized she was still almost naked he turned with a smile and lifted her breasts . She put the dress on and Sonny buttoned it in back . " I love you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on . " He did n't reply , but when they heard the back door open he kissed her lightly and walked blithely away , down the front sidewalk . Herman was in the kitchen , poking around in the cabinet trying to find some Mercurochrome to put on a skinned hand . He could never find things like that when he needed them . Ruth stood in the door a moment , watching him fumble in the cabinet , and her mood was so good that she felt a moment of fondness for him . All he really needed of her was an occasional small kindness . " I 'll find that , " she said . " How was fishing ? " For three weeks she continued to make his bed on the couch , and he accepted it , bewildered . Every night he thought he would think up a way to get his supremacy back , but every night the task proved too much for him and he decided it would n't hurt Ruth to have one more night to cool off . In fact , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to sleep alone . She slept better with a body next to hers , even if it was Herman 's . For a night or two she fought with herself , determined to keep the advantage she had gained , but she just felt more and more restless and decided finally that it was a silly way to keep an advantage . The next evening , when she was changing the pillowcases , she put Herman 's pillow back on the bed . Without a word being said , he came too.  |p199SUMMER  SHAPED UP very well for Sonny , but very badly for Duane . The first thing Sonny did was quit his job with Frank Fartley . He then hired on as a roughneck with Gene Farrow . He liked driving the butane truck better , but doing it full time gave him no chance to be with Ruth , whereas if he roughnecked at night he could count on spending the whole afternoon with her . Coach Popper was away fishing almost every day . Ruth was becoming happier every day , and was a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sonny both lived for the afternoons . Duane , unfortunately , had no one to make his days worthwhile . True to her word , Jacy had cut him off cold . Once in a while he saw her driving through town , her sun glasses on , the top of her convertible down , her bare arms tanned from all the hours she spent lying around the country club pool in Wichita . Such glimpses made him ache with desire , but ache was about all he could do . lie spent most of June futilely trying to get her to talk to him on the phone  --  usually she just hung up , but the few times she did n't hang up were even worse . " Why do n't you go back to Mexico , " she said once . " I guess girls are just easier to please down there . " " Just go with me once more , " he kept saying . " Just one more time . You can at least see me. "  |p200He  was convinced that if he were actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go away and they could be in love again . Jacy knew how he felt , and repeatedly refused to see him . The whole town knew he was desperate to get her back , which suited her fine . After a month had gone by she put a stop to the calls . " You find somebody else to pester , " she said . " I 've got a new boy friend now and I ca n't be talking to you . " " Who ? " Duane asked , confused . The blow was unexpected . " Lester Marlow , " Jacy said . " I guess I 've just been wanting to go with Lester all along and did n't realize it . " Duane hung up , went downstairs , and threw three pool balls against the back wall of the building as hard as he could , knocking out three big hunks of plaster and scaring Old Man Parsons almost to death . Old Man Parsonswas a retired hardware salesman who looked after the poolhall during the day . That night Duane told Sonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suitcase . " There 's not a goddamn thing to stay for , " he said . " I 'm goin ' to Midland . All the roughnecks say you can get a job out there anytime . jacy 's goin ' with Lester , why not leave ? " Sonny had no answer . Late that night he and Duane and Genevieve had coffee and pie together and Duane caught the three o'clock bus out . The prospect of setting out into the world had already taken Duane 's mind off his problem . He was speculating about what sort of wages he could draw in Midland . Sonny felt okay about it , figuring to see Duane back in Thalia as soon as Jacy got off to college . When they walked Duane to the bus in the warm summer night they all felt good . Sonny and Genevieve stood on the curb in front of the cafe and watched the busp201pull out . Soon all they could see of it were the red taillights , far out beyond the city limits sign . " Would n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Uncle Sam will see you get your chance , " Genevieve said , stretching her arms . Abilene 's Mercury was parked in front of the poolhall . Sonny was ready to go home , but he hated to go through the poolhall while Abilene was practicing . Finally he went in and had another cup of coffee with Genevieve , waiting to hear the Mercury roar away . When Jacy heard about Duane leaving town she was a little bit upset . His calls had not been all that annoying  --  sometimes when she was bored the calls picked her up a little . It was true that she had started going with Lester more or less officially , but it was certainly no deep love affair . She was getting ready to be deeply in love with Bobby Sheen , and she regarded Lester as a necessary stepping-stone . Only by going with someone in Bobby 's circle could she keep herself constantly before his eyes , and she knew that if she kept herself constantly before his eyes he would soon realize that she was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prettier than Annie-Annie , but at the same time it worried her a little that Annie-Annie always managed to look extremely sexy . The only thing Jacy could figure was that the sexy look was something Annie-Annie had acquired with experience , and there was certainly no reason why she could n't get just as much experience as Annie-Annie had . Lester Marlow was exactly suitable for such a purpose : he adored Jacy and was completely manageable . She still thought red pubic hair was a little ridiculous , but some things had to be accepted if one was to become a woman of the world . The Wichita kids called sexual intercourse " screwing , " so Jacy took to calling it that too . Lester 's parentsp202were in Colorado for the summer , so she and Lester could screw whenever they wanted to  --  Lester was always willing and usually more or less able . In a week or so Jacy managed to become completely unshy about the whole business , and even worked out a sort of routine . She slept until noon , got up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was home , put on shorts , sandals , a blouse , and her new sunglasses , and drove to Wichita . The drive always made her sweat a little and it was pleasant to walk into Lester 's big cool house . Lester would always be there , lookingslightly nervous . " Hi , " Jacy would say . " Want to screw ? " That was the favored approach among the Bobby Sheen set . Lester would n't have dared not to want to , so Jacy would go up to his parent 's bedroom , the room with the biggest , most comfortable bed . There she would peel off her clothes and wait for Lester to peel off his . The screwing itself was pretty athletic  --  Jacy had never been very big on athletics , but she knew good and well she could learn to screw if she put her mind to it . Fortunately , Lester had a good attitude : he would do exactly as directed . When they were finished they usually drove over to the country club and lay around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , most of whom had been screwing too . One day Bobby Sheen offered to rub suntan oil on Jacy 's hack and legs and she knew she was making progress . I le rubbed the oil on in a very sexy way , she thought . From time to time it occurred to her that she had really run Duane off too soon . He was n't quite as manageableas Lester , but he was really a good bit sexier , and she discovered that some of the girls thought there was something pretty romantic about sleeping with roughnecks . She could probably have got another month or so of good out of Duane , but that she had n't did n't really worry her : Bobby Sheen was the main objective , and ifp203for prestige reasons it became necessary to have a roughneckin love with her there was always Sonny . He was very available , and just as nice as Duane . Once , just to show that she was n't snobbish , she called Sonny up and invited him to have a hamburger with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decided to drive to Wichita and eat . Jacy drove , her hair blowing across her face . She had on a white silk blouse with the ends tied together in a knot across her stomach  --  an inch or two of her midriff showed between blouse and shorts . " Do you ever hear from Duane ? " she asked , sighing . " I really feel bad about that . " " I had a postcard , " Sonny said . " He 's makin ' threetwentya month . Said he bought a car . " " Well , I guess I 'll always be a little bit in love with Duane , " Jacy said . " We just had too much against us . It was n't easy having to be the one to break up . " Talking about it made Sonny uneasy . In fact , just riding with Jacy made him feel a little disloyal . He still thought of her as Duane 's girl . They ate hamburgers , drank milk shakes , and rode slowly back to Thalia , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the poolhall and went on home , realizing only after she got there that she had enjoyed the evening . Dating no one but Lester Marlow was really tiresome . Except for not being rich , Sonny was more her type of boy . The thought of screwing Lester one more time was utterly boring , but she did n't really feel like she could push things with Bobby Sheen . She decided that in a day or two she would call Sonny again and perhaps go to the lake with him to find out if she liked to kiss him . It would be nice once more to go with somebody she liked to kiss . The very next day , Bobby Sheen seduced her . AnnieAnniehad gone to Dallas to buy her college wardrobe ,  |p204and  Jacy had skipped Lester and gone straight to the club to swim . Bobby asked her if she wanted to go to his house to play some records and that was it . They spread towels over the seats of his MG and wore their wet bathing suits to the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down so he could play with her breasts . Jacy tried to concentrate and do everything right but it was actually pretty arousing , screwing Bobby Sheen , and she could n't keep her head clear . He was about five times as athletic as Lester and when she thought it over later she was pretty sure she came , which was what one was supposedto do . At any rate , she went to sleep and did n't wake up until six o'clock . She found Bobby downstairs . He had on Bermuda shorts and was eating a peanut butter sandwichwhile he watched the news on TV . " Peanut butter ? " he asked absently , when he noticed Jacy . She did n't want to eat , she wanted to sit in his lap , but she saw he was really watching the news and made herself refrain . They had come home in his car , she had no way to leave . During the commercial Bobby got up to fix himself another sandwich . " Oh , you 're afoot , are n't you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over I 'll run you back to the club . " He was quite cheerful and relaxed , but Jacy was a little surprised that lie did n't take on over her more than he did . For the next four or five clays she hung around the club pool almost constantly , expecting to hear that Bobbie and Annie-Annie had broken up ; she was sure that as soon as that happened Bobby would call her for another date . The next Sunday morning Jacy was in the kitchen peeling an orange when her mother came in from the bedroom to get more coffee . On Sunday mornings Lois always lay in bed and drank coffee until the coffee pot was empty . Gene was gone  --  he always spent Sunday morning inspecting his leases.  | " Honey , " Lois asked , " do n't you know that Sheen boy in Wichita ? Bobby Sheen ? " " I sure do , " Jacy said . " Why ? " " He got married yesterday to some girl named Annie Martin , " Lois said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them around the club . They got married in Oklahomaa couple of days ago and it just now made the paper . You know her ? " Jacy walked into the bedroom and found the article . It was just a tiny article with no picture , the kind the paper always ran when kids of prominent families ran off and got married without their parent 's consent . When Lois came into the bedroom with her coffee , Jacy was sitting on the bed crying bitterly . " He 's the luh-ast one , " she said . " I 'll just be an of maid . " Lois set her coffee down and got her daughter a box of Kleenex . She had seldom seen Jacy so upset , and least of all over a boy . Her tears were ruining the newspaper , and since she had n't finished reading it Lois gently pulled it away . " Oh , honey , " she said . " Do n't cry like that That 's the way it is , you know . Win a few , lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all through life . "  |p206ABOUT  A WEEK after Bobby Sheen got married , somethingtotally unexpected happened to Jacy , and it was led up to by an event so startling that everyone in Thalia almost went mad with surprise . Joe Bob Blanton was arrested for rape ! It was one of those days when it seemed to Christian people that the Lord must have lost all patience with the town . It was a wonder he had n't simply destroyed it by fire , like he had Sodom , and since the heat at midafternoonthat day was 109 degrees He could easily have done so simply by making the sun a little hotter . A few degrees more and the grass would have flamed , the buildings begun to smoke , and the asphalt streets to melt and bubble . Joe Bob did n't rape Jacy , of course , but the general confusion that followed his arrest made possible what did happen to her . Joe Bob did n't actually rape anybody , but very few would have believed that at the time . " That poor kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to preach , " Lois Farrow said , but she was the only one who took that view . No one else thought of blaming Brother Blanton for his son 's disgrace , and still less did they think of blaming Coach Popper or the school board president or San Francisco or Esther Williams , the movie star . They were all quite willing to put the blame squarely on Joe Bob himself.  |p208Joe  Bob was a seventeen year old virgin . For years he had been tormented by lustful thoughts . When he was only fourteen Brother Blanton slipped into his room one night and caught him masturbating by flashlight over a picture of Esther Williams . Joe Bob had torn the picture out of a movie magazine one of their neighbors had thrown away . Of course Brother Blanton whipped him severely and disposed of the picture ; he also told Joe Bob in no uncertain terms what the sequel of such actions would be . " Joe Bob , " he said , " have you ever been through the State Hospital in Wichita ? The insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Well , sometime I 'll take you , " Brother Blanton promised . " There are three or four hundred men over there , pitiful creatures , rotting away , no good to their families or to the Lord or anybody . I do n't know about all of their , some of them may have come from broken homes or been alcoholics , but I 'm sure most of those men are there because they did just what you were doing today . They abused themselves until their minds were destroyed . I do n't want to scare you now . You 're young , you have n't hurt yourself ' much , and the Lord will forgive you . I just want you to know what will happen if you keep on with this kind of filthiness . You understand , do n't you ? " " Yes sir , " Joe Bob said . He understood , but he soon discovered he was just too weak to stop . Ile kept right on playing with himself , all through high school , in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long it took for a mind to be destroyed , but he never doubted that his would be , sooner or later . In the summer of his junior year , when he got the call to preach , he thought there still might be hope . If he preached , girls might like him , and if they did he might be able to overcome his vices and lead a normal life . Thep209hope was very short-lived . The very night he preached his first sermon he succumbed to the vice again . Besides that , he found he did not really like to preach . He did n't have anything to say , and he soon decided he must have heard a false call : he could always get the Lord off his mind , but the only way he could get girls off his mind was by jacking off . In San Francisco he had been with the boys who wandered into the bar where Gloria was , and the thought of Gloria haunted him for weeks . By the time he got back home he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to make any effort to curb his self-abuse . If the Lord spared him until he got through college that would be enough to ask . Joe Bob might have got through the summer all right if it had not been for the scandal caused by Mr. Cecil 's dismissal . That set the town on its ear so that it made things hard for all sinners . The church ladies decided the time had come for some widespread soul-saving . If a homosexualwas teaching English in high school , there was no telling what state of degeneracy the ordinary populace had fallen into . Ruth Popper herself was known to be sleeping with a high-school boy . They decided to have an All City Revival , and they did n't waste any money bringing in a slick traveling evangelist who would have charged them three hundred dollars . There were six active preachersin the town , plus Joe Bob and a few old ones that were retired , so the ladies decided to put aside **25;7018;TOOLONG and make do with the native preaching stock . Everybody but Joe Bob thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it meant he would have to preach two sermons . " Yes sir , " Brother Blanton told him . " We 've all got to get out there and preach our hearts out if we 're going to get this town back on the right track . " Joe Bob agreed , but he was afraid he could preachp210his own heart completely out in just a minute or two . During the winter his ministerial flame had burned very low  --  he was not even confident that he himself was saved . He knew that he harbored hatred in his heart for about three-quarters of the boys of the town , and that was surely not a Christian attitude . He had no idea what he could say that might prompt anyone in the congregation to rededicate their life to Christ , and so far as he knew , gettingpeople to rededicate their lives was the only point of a revival . He worried about it for two weeks , and it turned out his worries were fully justified . Joe Bob had to preach the last sermon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to preach on a Thursday night , the worst possible night to preach . The first wave of revival spirit had had time to ebb , and the second wave had not yet begun to gather . The revival was held in the local baseball park under the lights , and when Joe Bob got up to preach there was just a sprinkle of a crowd , old faithfuls from all the churches in town , people so habituated to church going that they never missed a sermon , no matter how dull . Joe Bob was dressed in his black wool suit , the only suit his father would let him preach in . The night was sweltering . For days Joc Bob had racked his brain , trying to come up with a sermon , but the only moral advice he could think of was that people ought to read the Bible more . That was his theme . and he sweated and stammered away at it for twenty minutes . " When I say back to the Bible I do n't mean just a chapter here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full Gospel , the whole Bible , all of it ! Ever bit ! " He kept working that point over desperately , hoping somebody , at least one person , would come down and rededicate his life . Finally , to his great relief , the Pender family got down out of the stands and came . It was not much of a triumph , because the Pender family rededicatedp212their lives regularly , several times a year , but it was better than nothing . The Penders lived in a cabin down on Onion Creek where they shot squirrels and farmed sweet potatoes . Every two or three months , when things got boring , they came to church and rededicated their lives , hoping thereby to move the community to charity . They were a generally scruffy lot  --  in fact old man Elmer Pender spat tobacco juice right on home plate as Joe Bob was calling for the closing hymn . Because of the Penders , the first sermon was not a total disgrace , but Joe Bob still had the second one to preach . That one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the revival was due to end . Hysteria would be at its height , and Joe Bob knew he would need something more potent than the Full Gospel to exhort on that night . On the next-to-last night of a revival it would be a black disgrace not to get twenty or thirty rededications . All week he brooded about the final sermon . He knew good and well there was no way he could get out of it , and as the week wore on the only way he could get it off his mind was by abusing himself . By Saturday morning he was in a serious state . He stayed in his room until noon and abused himself twice . Then he talked his father into letting him use the family Plymouth , on the grounds that he needed to go off and commune with nature in order to get inspiration for his sermon . Nature that day was about as hot as the place Joe Bob was supposed to be saving people from . He drove out to the lake and sat staring at the water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to preach that night . Finally he tired of staring at the bright sun-whitened water and drove into town to get a coke . That move turned out to he his downfall . The facts of it almost passed belief . Nobody iii ' I'halia would have supposed that Joe Bob could get iii so muchp212trouble in Thalia , Texas , right in the middle of a hot Saturday afternoon . Sonny heard about it almost as soon as the news got out . The sheriff happened to be in the poolhall shooting a quiet game of snooker when Monroe , his skinny deputy , came bursting in , white as a sheet . " Sheriff , Johnny Clarg 's little girl has kinda been kidnapped , " he said . " They seen the preacher 's boy puttingher in his car about an hour and a half ago , in front of the drugstore . " " What the hell ? " the sheriff said , taking aim at a red ball . " Maybe Joe Bob gave her a ride home  --  be doing her a favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to kidnap Molly Clarg ? " " Do n't ask me , " Monroe said . " She ai n't at home , though . Miz Clarg 's all upset  --  she 's done looked everywherefor ' em . They was seen drivin ' out of town toward Olney . Miz Clarg 's afraid Joe Bob might be goin ' to mo-lest her or something . " At that . the sheriff quickly slapped his cue into a rack . He was getting beat anyway , and a sex crime called for immediate action . " Some of you boys might come with us , " he said . " If that 's the way it is , no tellin ' what we 'll find . " In all , three cars set out on the search . Brother Blantonwas in one , with his wife and some good church deacons . Mrs. Clarg was in another , with a deputy and some of her friends , and the sheriff and several men were in the lead car . Sonny was with the sheriff . Fortunately , no particular searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob had taken Molly outto an old lover 's lane , three or four miles south of town . " Boys , I do n't know what to think , but I fear theworst , " the sheriff said , wiping his sweaty face on his shirtsleeve . He drove like sixty , roaring over the rattly cattleguards as if they were n't there . If they had n't been luckyand encountered Joe Bob on an open stretch of dirt roadp213the sheriff might well have plowed right into lint and killed Molly and several other people . When they spotted him Joe Bob was on his way back to town , but he was coming reluctantly , at a speed of five miles an hour . Ile stopped instantly when he saw the three cars coming toward him . The sheriff quickly got out of his car and rolled down the cuffs of his shirt sleeves , while Joe Bob sat in the Plymouth , looking miserable . Everyone but Brother Blantonand his wife got out of the cars and stood looking indecisively at the Plymouth . After a moment Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yanked Molly out . Molly was five , and had been sitting quietly in the front seat eating a lemon all-day sucker Joe Bob had given her . When her mother yanked her out everybody noticed that she did n't have her panties on . " Get him , ai n't you goin ' to ? " Mrs. Clarg cried . " He 's the one done it , here 's my little girl , why do n't you get him . If my husband was here he 'd kill him dead . " At that the sheriff and Monroe leaped in and pulled Joe Bob out of the car . " What 'd you do to that child ? " the sheriff said . " We all know you done somethin ' . " Joe Bob started to say something but he was too scared and nervous to get it out . Instead he collapsed , and they carried him to the sheriff 's car and rushed him back to Thalia . Sonny volunteered to drive the Blanton 's Plymouth into town . Seeing Joe Bob so scared depressed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying in the car seat  --  no one had noticed them , but Sonny supposed they were evidence so he left them there . By the time he gut back to town the poolhall was full of men , all of them talking about the crime . It was generally agreed that Johnny Clarg would go to the jailhouse and kill Joe loh as soon as he came in off his rig.  |p214Then  Monroe came in with news that the doctor had said Joe Bob had n't actually done anything to Molly . Apparentlyhe had just given her the lemon all-day sucker as a bribe to get her to take her panties off , and that was all he had done . It was kind of a letdown . " Never had the guts , " Andy Fanner said . " Preacher 's boy . " " Well , the sheriff figures he might have mo-lested her a little bit , " Monroe said . " It stands to reason . " " I 've thought for years the boy was that kind , " Coach Popper said , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob had found the one method available to him for getting out of his second revival sermon . He spent that night and many others in jail , but in a way , what did happen at the revival that night was his triumph . His disgrace made possible the greatest upsurge of religiousfeeling the town had ever known . Brother Blanton insisted on preaching his son 's sermon , and what he said did it . I le rose above calamity and got right out there on home plate to lay matters on the line . " Good people , " he said , " I guess today I 've suffered about the worst shock that can come to a man of God . My own son sits in jail tonight , sick with corruption . This very afternoon he was caught in an act of carnal trespass , a thing so foul it 's almost unspeakable . How that tears my heartstrings I ca n't say , but what I want you to know tonightis that I 've conic through . The Lord has held me up . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob , I 've given him up to the Lord . I 've prayed to the good Lord this very night that they 'll send my boy to prison . Yes , to prison ! Sometimes in this life things just do n't work out , and I believe it is God 's mcrcwill that Joe Bob go to suffer with the murderer and the thief . It will be a hard thing but a just thing , and I know Joe can count on God 's help . " At that Brother Blanton broke down , stretched hisp215arms to the crowd , and began to cry . " Oh , my friends , " he said . " If only you would take heed from my trouble . If only you would listen and realize that Jesus Christ is the only answer . If only you would come down tonight , just come down and pray with me and let all of us rededicateour lives right now to the pure way , the righteous way .... " The crowd was overcome by Brother Blanton 's selfsacrifice . They flocked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapping at their faces with damp powder puffs , trying to keep their makeup from running completely off . The Penders even came again , Elmer , Lee Harvey , and Mag , the three of them swept away by the general fervor . There was one strange moment though , right at the start of the sermon : Lois Farrow walked out . As soon as Brother Blanton said he hoped Joe Bob would go to jail , Lois left the stands , got in the Cadillac , and drove away . A lot of tongues clicked  --  most people thought Lois needed saving worse than anyone in town . Even Brother Blanton felt a momentary irritation when he saw her leaving . Savinga soul as far gone as hers would have really gained him some heavenly credit . What Lois did after she left was even more unusual : she went down to the jail and made Monroe let her play checkers with Joe Bob . It almost passed belief , but she sat right in the cell and played Joe Bob three games , two of which Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . Getting out of the sermon had taken a big load off his mind . Jacy stayed home from the revival and spent the evening watching television . While Gunsmoke was on het Daddy and Abilene came in . She could hear them in the kitchen , drinking and talking about some drilling ; ! nob tern . After a while Abilene came into the room witli a whiskey glass in his hand and stood looking at her.  | " Hi , " she said . " Where 's Daddy ? " " Gone to bed . " " Want me to turn the TV off ? " she asked . She was never quite sure what Abilene expected of her . " Naw , I 'm going to the poolhall soon as I finish this drink , " he said , leaning against the doorjamb . She was in shorts and her legs were stretched out on Gene 's footstool . " Wish I could go to a poolhall , " she said , with a small pout . " I 've always wanted to . It 's terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why hell , come on , " Abilene said . " No problemthere . I 'll show you the poolhall . I got my own key . " He had always thought of her as a prissy kid , but herlegs convinced him he had n't been watching close enough . " Are n't there people there ? " she asked . " If there are they 'll be upstairs asleep , " he said . " They wo n't bother us . " " Okay , I will go then . " She felt a little nervous , but she knew he would be irritated if she backed out . She stepped out into the night in front of him . Just getting in the Mercury was exciting : it was the most famous car in that part of the country , and the seat covers smelled of tobacco and beer . Abilene kept it very neat . There was nothing vulgar in it , no dice hanging from the rearview mirror , but there was something on the dashboard that fascinated Jacy . I t was a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it to the dashboard , and as the car - coved the statue wiggled provocatively . The woman had a gold stomach and tiny little bloodstones for nipples . Jacy tried not to stare at her . When they stopped in front of the poolhall Abilene took a comb from behind the sun visor and slicked his hair back a little . ' l'hc building itself was very dark . Abilenewent in first and turned on a little light behind the cash register ; he looked at her so inscrutably that Jacyp217began to be nervous . After he locked the door he got his special cue out of its drawer . He pulled the light string above one of the snooker tables and the flourescent tubes blinked on and spread bright light over the green felt and the neat triangle of red balls . As Jacy watched , Abilene put the jointed cue together and glanced appreciatively down its polished length . The cue had an ivory band just below the tip . Jacy was fascinated . She had never been in such a male place before , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abilene took a white cue ball out of one of the pockets and rolled it slowly across the table . Then he nudged the ball gently with his cue and it went across the table and came back , right to the end of the cue . Abilene smiled , and Jacy came over and stood beside him , so that she could see better . He handled the cue as lovingly as if it were a part of his body . " Can I see it a minute ? " she asked . Abilene held it out to her a little reluctantly , clearly unwilling to let it leave his hand . Jacy held it awkwardly , trying to sight along it as expertly as he had . When she leaned over the table and playfully attempted to shoot the cue ball Abilene stepped in and took the cue away . " I do n't let nobody shoot with this one , " he said . " There 's plenty of others to shoot with , if you just want to practice . " Jacy pouted a little , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bench and watched Abilene as he got ready to shoot . She had never seen a man who was so absolutely sure of himself . He put the white cue ball in the center of the table , sighted quickly , and then with a quick hard thrust of his hips sent the white ball rauinliug into the tight triangle of red balls . There was a sharp crack , and the red balls scattered and rolled all over thep218table , a few of them bumping together with soft little clicks . Abilene began to shoot them into pockets , moving lightly and purposefully around the table . The cue was never still . Sometimes he held it up and rubbed a little more chalk onto the tip , or propped it briefly against his hip as he contemplated a shot , but most of the time he did n't contemplate , he just moved rapidly and smoothly from shot to shot . Jacy began to bite a hangnail on her thumb . She had never seen anything like what she was seeing . Sometimes Abilene seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ball softly and gently and barely easing the red ball into the pocket . Sometimes he was quick with one stroke and slow with the next , and sometimes , as if excited or annoyed , he suddenly shot a ball very hard , ramming it into a pocket with a quick disdainful thrust of the cue . The balls made a solid thonk when they were whammed into the pockets . Abilene was totally absorbed in the table full of balls , and Jacy became almost as absorbed in the lovely movements of the cue . When all the balls were gone Abilene racked them and quickly broke again . The hard crack of the cue ball affected Jacy strangely . She felt a trickle of sweat roll out of her armpit and down her ribs . She was vaguely aware that she wanted something , but she could n't take her eyes off Abilene long enough to think what . IIc took his time with the second rack , moving around the table more slowly , now lifting the cue and dropping it , withdrawing it and shoving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyedthat he had forgotten her  --  she squirmed a little on the bench , feeling sweaty . She wanted to run and grab the cue away from him , so he would realize she was there . But she merely sat , and he kept shooting until only the cue ball and one red ball were left : . That one he shot terribly hard , without caution , thonking it into one of the corner pockets . The sound made something happen in Jacy , some/thing like what used to happen when she and Duane courted on the basketball trips . Abilene must have known it happened . He laid the cue gently on the green felt and the next minute was kissing her , one hand rubbing her shorts . Jacy found she had no muscles left  --  she was limp , leaning back against the wall . But when he stepped back a little her hand followedand caught his wrist . Abilene shook her hand off and went and got an old pair of overalls that were hanging on a nail near the door of the poolhall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then carefully spread the overalls on the snooker table before he switched that light off too . When he came back to Jacy the hall was dark except for the rows of light coming through the south windows from the lampposts along the street . " Come on , stand up , " he said . When she did , he urged her out of her clothes , waiting impatiently , and when the clothes were strewn at her feet , he ran his hands down her sides , grinning a little , not at the thought of her but at the thought of her mother . " Be sure you got them overalls under you , " he said , when he helped her up on the table . In a moment he was above her and Jacy pressed her hands against the hard muscles of his arms , not sure of anything . Then he moved and she was sure again , sure it was hurting , sure he was too much . She stretched her arms above her head and caught her fingers in the corner pockets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quit but he was ignoring her , and before she could tell him it changed ; she was no longer hurting but she was still ignored . He was just going on , absorbed in himself , moving , nudging , thrusting  --  she was no more object . She wanted to protest that , but before she i ould she began to lose sight of herself , lose hold of het sell . She was rolled this way and that , into feelings she had n't known , had n't expected , could n't avoid . She lost all Of doing anything , she was completely lost to luise.  |p220|played  her out as recklessly as he had played the final ball , and when he did she scattered as the red balls had scattered when the white one struck them so hard . She spread out , diffused , almost unconscious . Abilene said nothing . Jacy did n't know anything until she realized he had left the table and was not touching her anymore . In a minute she got up too and tried to find somethingof herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wonderful . Abilene was going to be in love with her , and he counted for more than Bobby Sheen or any of the boys at the club . The only thing that worried her was that he kept ignoring her . He did n't even help her find her clothes . But it was such a romantic situation , screwing in a poolhall , that surely being in love would follow . When they got back in the Mercury she tried to make him say something to her . " What a night , " she said . " I never thought anything like this would happen . " " Yeah , " Abilene said . They pulled into the Farrow driveway and he glanced at her . She leaned over and kissed him but he turned his face away . Jacy got out , very puzzled , and walked across the yard . When she was halfway across , Abilene raced his motor and made his mufflers roar , so that anyone in the neighborhood who was awake would know what car was in the driveway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she stepped in the back door that Jacy realized her mother was home and would have heard the mufflers . Lois did hear them  --  she was in the den in her bathrobeand slip , having a light drink and watching a Spencer Tracy movie on the Late Show . When she heard Abilene 's car she got up and went to the kitchen , wondering what he wanted at that time of night . She had not even realized that Jacy was out until they met in the kitchen . Jacy 's hair was tangled and she was barefooted , her slippers in herp221hand . She looked scared and very confused , and iii a moment a couple of tears leaked out of her eyes  --  she had just realized that Abilene was n't going to be in love with her at all . It was a terrible disappointment . She was too upset to keep quiet . " Oh , he 's awful , " she said . " Why do you fool with him , Mama ? Daddy 's a nicer man than him , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat her glass down and with a Kleenex ruefully wiped Jacy 's wet face . " He sure is , honey , " she said . " Your Daddy 's a very nice man . I ought to have given Abilene hell , instead of him . " At that moment she did n't feel capable of giving anyonehell , or anything else , either . What Abilene had done hit hard , and her legs felt weak . She freshened her drink and went back to the den to sit down , but the movie was just a blur . For a minute she felt like crying , but she felt too insignificant to cry , too valueless . When she went back in to get another drink , Jacy was sitting morosely at the cabinet reading an article on lipsticks in an old fashion magazine . " Go to bed , honey , " Lois said . " Or come and watch television with me . Brooding 's no good . " Jacy did n't feel like going to bed , so she obediently followed her mother into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . In a few minutes Jacy began to cry again . She was sitting on the floor and she moved back against Lois ' legs and put her face in her mother 's lap . Lois stroked her hair . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do , " Jacy said , look ing up . " What do you do about it , Mama ? Life just is n't the way it 's supposed to be at all . " " You 're right , " Lois said , smoothing back the hair on her daughter 's temples . " It is n't the way it 's supposed to lie at all , but what I 've done about it has n't worked very well . Maybe we better work out something different for you . "  |p223HER  DISAPPOINTMENT WITH Abilene left Jacy very depressed . It was only the middle of July and she could n't leave for college for six weeks , but she just could n't stand the idea of staying in Thalia that much longer . She had slept with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither one of them had fallen in love with her or even shown any particular interest in sleeping with her again . Screwing in the poolhall had been wild while it lasted , but it was hardly going to keep her from rotting with boredom for the rest of the summer . It would have helped if she could have told somebody about it  --  if the story got out that she had slept with Abilene on a snooker table she would have been a legend in Thalia forever , but she could n't think of any way to publicize it . Neither Abilene nor her mother were going to , that was for sure , so the whole thing was just wasted . It was disgusting . The more she thought about matters the more annoyedshe was at Duane for leaving town so soon . Things would not have looked quite so dull if he had stayed around . She was not about to start up again with Lester . One morning while she and Lois were eating a list less breakfast , Jacy gave vent to her irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas , " she said . " I do n't see how people keep livin ' in this town . There 's not one thing to do . "  | " Well , there is one thing to do , " Lois said , chewing a section of orange . " The problem is finding a man to do it with who is n't either dull or obnoxious . Right now I guess Ruth Popper 's got about as good a setup as any-body . " Jacy was amazed . " Ruth Popper , " she said . " You mean you would like to do that with the coach , Mama ? Why I think he 's the most horrible man around here . He 's even worse than Abilene . " " I did n't say anything about him , " Lois said , spitting the orange seeds into her hand . " I would n't let that tub of guts come within fifteen feet of me . Ruth 's been sleeping with Sonny Crawford for about six months now , did n't you know ? I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's young . If I did n't have anythingbetter than Herman Popper , Sonny would look awfully good . " " What ? " Jacy said . " Are you kidding me ? Sonny sleeping with Mrs. Popper ? Why that 's the silliest thing I ever heard of . She 's forty years old . " " So ani I , honey , " Lois said . " It 's kind of an itchy age . You want the rest of this orange ? " Jacy was just flabbergasted  --  life was crazy . She did n't want the orange , and she did n't like the idea of Sonny sleeping with Mrs. Popper . That would n't do at all . She had always considered Mrs. Popper mousy , and besides Sonny had always wanted to go with her , not with someone forty years old . It was unflattering of him to sleep with Mrs. Popper . It did end her boredom , though . She decided then and there that she would stop that romance and stop it good . She would go with Sonny for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Popper another thought . He was reasonably good looking , like her mother said , and going with him would n't be too unpleasant . It would make August pass a lot quicker . Necking with him mightp225even be fun , but she made up her mind right away that she was n't going to let him screw her . She had had quite enough of that for one summer  --  it did n't really work out . She was nostalgic for the days when boys necked with her and wanted her desperately and did n't get her . That was better than actually screwing , somehow . When she got to college she could start screwing again and there it would probably be altogether great . Fraternity boys were gentlemenand would fall right in love with her when she let them screw her . That very evening Jacy called Sonny and told him she was bored and lonesome ; why did n't they go to Wichita and eat Mexican food ? Sonny was eager , and the very thought of someone eager perked Jacy up . She took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , and did her hair in an Italian way that made it look casually disarrayed . She wore a sleeveless dress and a sexy bra that left the tops of her breasts uncovered . When Sonny went to pick her up he was not sure exactly what might happen . Jacy was relaxed and at ease and chattered away about one thing and another . They left Sonny 's pickup in the Farrow 's driveway and went in the convertible . One of Jacy 's arms was stretched out on the top of the seat , almost touching Sonny 's shoulder . Before they got to Wichita she scooted over next to him , close enough that he could smell her perfume . The wind whipped a few strands of her hair against his neck . On the way back , after the meal , she rested her arm lightly against his shoulder . Sonny was in a quandary . He did n't know if he was still honor-bound to treat Jacy as Duane 's girl , or if he could treat her as if she were free . Duane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there was no guarantee that Jacy would go with him if he did . It was confusing , and having her so close to him made Sonny feel a little bit disloyal.  | " Let 's go to the lake , " Jacy suggested , when they were back in Thalia . " I have n't been there in a long time . " It was exactly what Sonny wanted to do , but as he drove there his uneasiness increased . The thought of Ruth popped into his mind  --  they had seen each other that very afternoon , and had had an ardent , sweaty , good time . It was more sweaty than was usual because the Popper 's air conditioner had broken down and the coach had gone off fishing without fixing it . After their lovemaking Ruth and he had showered together , to cool off . He had stood behind her and watched the streams of water sluice off her shoulders , her back , her small hips . Driving to the lake , it occurredto him that in a way he was bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light-voiced , her hair fragrant , her arm cool , it was hard to keep Ruth in mind . He had wanted Jacy for years , and had fantasized just the sort of situation he was approaching . The lake was very still , but the crickets were singing and bullfrogs croaked loudly in the south channel , where the water was shallow . For a moment , after stopping , Sonny sat still . Any move would put Jacy in his arms and involve him in two disloyalties , but Jacy was very close to him , so close that he could hear her breath , and soon he was unable to think about anything but her . When he turned , Jacy closed her eyes and they kissed for a long time . She was delighted . It was thrilling to bestow oneself upon someone young and worshipful . It made her feel like a generous , experienced , worldly woman , and feeling that way did something for her that Abilene and Bobby could n't do . It was the way life was supposed to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the little amorous flourishes she could think of , nibbling his lower lip and now and then slipping her tongue into his mouth . She could not really believe all those stories about Mrs. Popper  --  he seemed too hesitant and inexperienced . She would be the one to teach him about love and passion . That thoughtp227excited her even more , and when his hand touched her bare throat she sat back and with a wanton shrug undid the front of her dress . She rested her head against the back of the seat and smiled at him when he lifted her breasts out of the shallow cups of the bra . To Sonny it seemed a little incredible that he was holding those particular soft breasts in his hands at last . He held them and fondled them for quite some time , and not only that night but almost every night for the following two weeks . Jacy 's breasts were his , her mouth was his , indeed almost all of her was his . She shivered , smiled , kissed his fingers , nibbled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , but when he grew bold and began to want to go all the way , she diverted him with her mouth or her breasts and told him it would n't do . " Not here , " she said huskily . " I 'm too old for screwingin cars . I like beds . " Sonny was surprised at her language , but encouraged . He suggested they go to Wichita and get a motel room , but Jacy quickly thought her way out of that . " I would , but I 'm afraid to right now , " she said . " I think my folks are watchin ' us . They know I do n't want to go to college and they think we 're goin ' to run off and get married . " Sonny was surprised , but not entirely persuadedand Jacy nuzzled at his ear . " We 'll do it when it 's safe , " she said . " I do n't like to be in a hurry . " Until that night it had never occurred to Sonny that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii taking hold of him . He began to think about it practically all the time . Nothing at all was said about Ruth . Jacy never let on that she knew anything about him and Ruth , and Sonny did n't mention it . After the first date with acy he did not once go back to Ruth 's . He could not have faced her . At times he missed her , and he often missed making love to her , but he did not go back . Sometimesp228in the middle of the night he would wake up and feel nervous and ashamed . Late at night he could not help facing the fact that he had treated Ruth shamefully and probably hurt her very much . He did n't understand it , but he knew Ruth loved him . It was unreasonable , but she did ; she had put herself at his disposal , and he had left her . It was n't right and it made him feel terrible , but at the same time he knew he was n't going to quit going with Jacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt for Jacy was beyond fairness . He had a chance to have something he had always wanted , and he was n't going to pass the chance up . He and Ruth would soon have had to quit anyway , he told himself . She was old . Her brown hair was not free of gray . Seeing Jacy at close range had made him realize how old Ruth really was . Ruth 's thighs were a little thin , and when she sat up her breasts sagged , not much but some , enough to notice . It did n't make much difference , and yet it did . Jacy 's body was fresher and smoother , and it even smelled a little better . All the same , he hated being the cause of Ruth 's suffering . The only way he knew how to handle it was just not to go near her , or to say anything to her , or to try to justify what he had done . To Ruth , his absence spoke very clearly . She knew at once what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers named Fanny Franklin mentioned that she had seen Sonny with Jacy Farrow . " They better get that girl off to school before she marries one of these roughnecks , " Fanny said happily . She knew all about Ruth and Sonny , though she had never mentioned it , and it gave her a good bit of satisfaction to break such news to Ruth . For a day or two Ruth spent much of her time sitting listlessly in front of the television set , not crying , just sitting . She did n't despair . Sonny had always wanted thep229Farrow girl  --  it was natural he would go with her if he got the chance . Still , she thought he might continue to come and see her once in awhile , if only for sex . Even if he only did that it would be okay . She just needed to be with him a little while , from time to time . When he had not come for two weeks , Ruth was forced to conclude that sex with her did not mean that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he would never come , not ever again . If she saw him at all it would be on the street , and he would do his best to avoid her . She looked in the mirror often , and it told her more plainly than ever that she was old . She hated being old and despised Jacy Farrow for being young . Before long she began to despise Sonny too . The afternoons were long and hot and unrelieved and she would have forgiven him in a minute if he had come through the door . She could not do anything in the afternoons for wondering if he would come , and she could barely handle her disappointment when he did n't . At first she did n't cry , but later she cried a great deal and it only made her look older and uglier . All the neighborhood women began to come to see her , friendly and smug , but she herself scarcely ever went out  --  she only went to the grocery store . At times she felt dizzy and almost feverish . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other ways . From time to time she tried playing with herself , but it did n't work very well . One night in a moment of bitterness she grasped Herman and tried to get him to play with her , but he jerked himself angrily away and she did n't try again . If Sonny was not coming back , there was no point in her wanting sex anymore . It was a door she might just as well close . The nadir came one day in the grocery store , when she bumped into Jacy . Ruth was in an old dress , her hair was dry , and she had not bothered to put on makeup . 1aey was in shorts , tight at the thighs . Her legs were tannedp230and her hair shone . They passed one another in front of the pork and beans . Jacy had on sunglasses , but she took them off when she met Ruth . " Why hello , Mrs. Popper , " she said , grinning with delight . " Have n't seen you in the longest time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When Ruth got home she began to tremble . She carried the blue quilt across the hot yard and stuffed it in the garbage can . She could think of no reason why anyone should desire her or want to know her or touch her , and she did not expect to touch or make love to anyone she cared about as long as she lived . It was a terrible feeling , knowing she would never really touch anyone again . She lay on the bed all afternoon staring dully at the wallpaper and wishing there were some simple way to die . She tried to remember herself when she was young , tried to recall one time in her life when she had been as attractive as Jacy , but she could n't think of one . It seemed to her she had always been old . There was no relief in blaming Sonny , because what was there to blame him for ? Jacy was exactly the type of girl with whom boys were supposed to fall in love . She herself was just the football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tower and found Duane in the apartment , asleep on the couch . While Sonny was taking a shower he woke up and came groggily into the bathroom . " How you doin ' , buddy , " he said . " It 's a real drive from here to Odessa , especially if you do n't start till after you get off work . " " Where 's your car ? " Sonny asked . Duane took him downstairs and proudly showed him the car  --  it was a second hand Mercury , nice and clean . " Thirty-eight thousand miles on her , " Duane said . " Runs like new . I like to drive it so much I thought I 'd run home for the weekend . " Sonny was a little relieved . For a few minutes he had been worried that Duane 's trip home might have something to do with his relationship with Jacy . Fortunately she was in Dallas that weekend , buying her college clothes . Duane looked almost the same , except that he was browner . He wore shirts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper arms were tanned almost black . " You do n't know what sun is till you live out on that desert , " he said . " Them folks in Odessa do n't even know it 's a desert , they think it 's God 's country . " Ile smoked a lot more than he had , but he was out of se ! mid and not in training , and it was natural . The poolhall was always full of people oil . Saturdays.  |p232It  was almost football season and football was what everybodywanted to talk about . The men were glad to see Duane and asked him what kind of football teams they had way out in west Texas . " Wish you was back here , Duane , " several said . " We could use a good fullback this year . " Such talk made Duane feel fine . He had always been very proud of being in the backfield . When it began to get dark Sonny and he decided to drive to Wichita and drink some beer . They put on fresh Levi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury . He insisted that Sonny drive it . " Handles wonderful , " Sonny said . " Quite a change from that pickup . " They started the evening at a place called the PanhandleTavern , out on the Burkburnett highway . It was a good place to drink beer , but then nearly any place was . When they left there they stopped in at the big Pioneer drive-in and watched a steady stream of teen-age boys and girls circling around one another in their cars . Finally they went on to Ohio Street and drank in a big roomy bar the size of a barn . There were a lot of airmen there , dancing , playing the shuffleboard , guzzling beer . Duane and Sonny drank and idly watched the dancing . It was pleasant for a while , and then for some reason it began to go wrong . An edge came into the evening . Sonny felt it long before anything was said . He kept drinkingbeer , but he did n't get high , the way he should have . He should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were best buddies  --  but somehow he was n't comfortable with him at all . The pretty girls on the dance floor reminded both of them of things they did n't really want to remember . " Still screwin ' that old lady ? " Duane asked casually . " Yeah , ever now and then , " Sonny said . It seemedto him the best thing to say . Duane had n't mentionedp233Jacy all day , but Sonny knew he must have been thinking about her . " Seen old Jerry Framingham last week , " Ile said . " He came through going to Carlsbad with a load of goats . Said he thought you and Jacy had been going together a little . " " Yeah , we have , " Sonny admitted quickly . " Once and a while we come over here and eat Mexican food or something . She 's been kinda bored , waitin ' for school to start . " He did n't look at Duane but he could tell that something was wrong . Instead of looking at Duane he looked around the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bunches of glum airmen stood around with beer glasses in their hands . There was a jukebox , a Schlitz sign , and a clock that said Lone Star Beer underneath it . " Way I heard it what you probably been eatin ' is pussy , " Duane said , his voice shaky and strained . " Not old lady Popper 's , either . " " It ai n't true , " Sonny said . " Whoever told you that did n't know what he was talkin ' about . Sure , I been goin ' with Jacy , why not ? " He could n't keep down a pulse of irritation with Duane for having kept so quiet about the matter all day . He had kept quiet about it too , but then it was n't his place to bring it up . " I never said I blamed you for it , " Duane said . " I do n't blame you much . I just never thought I 'd see the day when you 'd do me that way . I thought we was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonny said . " What are you so mad for ? I never done nothin ' to you . " " I guess screwin ' my girl ai n't nothin ' to you , " I said stiffly . " I have n't screwed her , but she ai n't your go I anymore , anyway . Hell , you do n't even live here . mytnotc . " " Do n't make no difference , " Duane insisted . I le wasbeginning to seem drunk . " She 's my girl and I do n't matep234if we did break up . I 'm gon na get her back , I 'm tellin ' you right now . She 's gon na marry me one of these days , when I get a little more money . " Sonny was astonished that Duane could be so wrong . He knew Duane must be drunk . " Why she wo n't marry you , " he said . " She 's goin ' off to school . I doubt I 'll ever get to go with her agin myself , once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with her this summer , though . She 's never gon na marry you . " " She is , by God , " Duane said . " Do n't tell me she ai n't . She 'll never let you screw her , that 's for sure . Hell , I was just seein ' how honest you was , I knew Jacy would n't let you screw her . You ai n't that good a cocksman . You never even screwed Charlene Duggs , all the time you went with her . " Sonny did n't know what to say . He was amazed that Duane would bring up such a matter . It was unfair , and the more he thought about it the madder he felt . " Course I did n't , " he said . " You know why ? Because you and Jacy had the pickup all the time on Saturday night . Nobody could have screwed her in the time I had left . " " I could have , " Duane said smugly . " I could have screwed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because it was true it seemed even more unfair of Duane to bring it up . Suddenly , for the first time in his life , he felt like hitting Duane . " You know why you could , " he said , almost choking . " The only reason you could have was because you was in the backfield . I was in the fuckin ' line . That 's the only reason Jacy went with you as long as she did , because you was in the backfield . " " That 's a lie , you chickenshit , " Duane said . " What are you talkin ' about ? Me an ' her was in love . " " You was , she was n't , " Sonny said confidently . " Justp235because you was in the backfield . She likes me as good as she ever liked you . I 'll stay all night with her one of these nights , too  --  she 's done promised . " " You wo n't either , " Duane said , furious . " Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even do it that time in San Francisco . What about that ? " Duane could n't take that . He came out of his chair and slammed Sonny in the face with the beer bottle he had in his hand . It knocked Sonny backward , but he was soon up and at Duane . It was too much to take , saying he could n't have screwed Charlene , just because he was in the line . Sonny could n't see too well , but it did n't matter because in a minute they were both rolling on the floor anyway , punching and kicking at one another . The barmaidsand the airmen calmly got out of the way and the boys rolled over against the bar , whacking at one another and bonking their heads on the brass footrail . They got up and slugged a minute on their knees but before they could get to their feet the cops were there . The next thing they knew they were out on the curb , each handcuffed to a cop . One of Sonny 's eyes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but otherwise he did n't feel too bad . He and Duane stood beside one another at the police desk , and to their surprise were no longer particularly mad . " Do n't know what happened , " Duane said . " Never meant to hit you with that bottle . Reckon we got enough money to pay our fines ? " They did have , barely , and in a few more minutes , without knowing exactly what had taken place , they were on the sidewalk again , walking back up Ohio Street . " 1'liey walked past the bar where they had had the fight and one of the barmaids waved at them , tolerant , jolly , and apparentlyamused . It deflated the boys a little hit . Theirs must not have been much of a fight , as fights went on Ohio Street . " My damn eye sure hurts , " Sonny said . ' Run me upp236by the General Hospital  --  maybe they can give me a shot or something . It 's a wonder we did n't tear up that bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in there ever night , " Duane said unhappily . " When it comes to Jacy I guess I 'm just crazy . " By the time they got to the hospital Sonny 's eye had swollen shut and was paining him terribly . The momentarygood feeling that he had had at the police station was entirely gone , and he was a little scared . It was nice that he and Duane were not going to be enemies for life , but he was still scared . When a doctor finally took a look at his eye he immediately ordered Sonny a hospital room . " You 're not leavin ' here tonight , " he said . " You could lose the sight in that eye if we are n't careful , and you might lose it even if we are . In the morning we 'll have to have a good look at it . " " Damn , " Duane said nervously . " Why 'd I have to have that bottle in my hand ? " " Aw , they 're always tryin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it 's just swole up . " Duane was really worried , and it made him so nervous and stiff that Sonny was almost glad when he left . He had a shot that made him sleep , and the next day the eye was hurting so badly that he had several more shots and was just in a sort of daze all day . He knew his father was there some of the time . The ( lay after that he had some kind of operation , and when he woke up his father was there , shaking a little but not too badly . It was the first time they had seen one another since graduation night , when Sonny had reluctantly accepted fifty dollars as a graduation present . " Son , must have been some fight , " Frank said . " Oh , just me and Duane . He gone back to Odessa ? " " Yeah , he had to . Tried to see you yesterday , but they would n't let him . He said to tell you he was awful sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sonny said . " I might have done it to him if I 'd been holding a bottle . What 'd they say about my eye ? " " They do n't know yet , " Frank said . " You did n't lose all your sight in it , but I guess you might lose some . " Sonny found it was not so bad having his father around . Frank did n't say much , just sat in the room . f le seemed comfortable and Sonny was too . There was only one awkward moment in the three days Frank stayed . I t. came one might when Sonny was eating supper . " Son , " Frank said , " reckon it would work out if we put the poolhall and the domino hall together ? The building'sbig enough , ai n't it ? " It was , but the whole idea made Sonny nervous . " I do n't think it would do too well , " he said . " The men who play dominos would n't want a lot of kids in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be so , and did n't mention it again . Sonny was in the hospital eight days . He got lonesome , but it was just about as bad when visitors came . Genevieve came one afternoon and brought Billy , who was scared of the hospital and did n't know whether to sit down or stand up . Sonny was so used to seeing Genevieve in her waitress uniform that she looked strange to him in her regular clothes . She came right out and asked about his eye . " How is it , really ? " she said . " I do n't know , " Sonny said honestly . " It would n't surprise me if I was one-eyed when they take the bandages off . Duane caught me a good hard lick . " " Well , it was awful of you two to fight . You knew lie joined the army , did n't you ? His mother told tin o or three days ago . " Sonny had n't known it , and was very stir1 iwe  --  d. lot the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to go to the army too , and it c ) e c titled top238him that if he was one-eyed the army would n't take him . He had never supposed he would be unable to make the army . The next afternoon the nurse brought in a note . " A lady 's down in the waiting room , " she said . The note just said : " May I come in and see you a little while ? Ruth . " Sonny looked at the nurse , who was young and friendly . " Could you tell her I 'm asleep ? " he asked . " Sure I could . But you 're not asleep . " " If I go to sleep right now will you tell her I 'm asleep ? " The nurse did as he asked , but Sonny was blue anyway . He would not have minded seeing Ruth , but he felt bad whenever lie thought about her and he was afraid that if she came up something bad might happen . In a way he wanted to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more lonesome he became for her  --  but it seemed like seeing her would only make everything worse . The next to last day he was there , Jacy came to see him . She wore a sleeveless green dress and looked a little sad . As soon as the nurse left the room she came to the bed and kissed Sonny for a long time . It surprised him and he embarrassed himself a little by getting a hard on . " Oh , I was so worried , " Jacy said . " I just had to see you . When do you get out ? " " Tomorrow , " Sonny said . " Why ? " " I want us to get married , " Jacy said , her dewy mouth close to his . " I really do . Whenever you get out , just as soon as you want to . " Sonny was stunned . " Get married ? " he said . He thought he must be having a dream . " Do you want to ? " she asked . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't you goin ' to college ? "  | " No . I do n't care about that . I love you and that 's more important . My folks wo n't like it , but we can run off . " It was an inspiration she had had as soon as she heard about the fight . Sonny was so dear , to fight for her . Runningoff with him would make her whole summer , and the fact that she did it even though he only had one eye would knock everyone in Thalia for a loop . It would be a lot wilder than Bobby Sheen and Annie-Annie  --  they were both rich and healthy . She would be running off with someone poor and sort of mutilated . Of course her folks would catch them and have it annulled , but at least she could show Sonny how much she was willing to sacrifice for him . Jacy sat on the hospital bed and they kissed some more and talked about how wild it would be being married . Life seemed almost too crazy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't that he could n't see anything out of it , it was just that all he could see was fog . It was like being inside a cloud . He could tell when people moved around , but he could n't tell who they were until they spoke . " Could be a lot worse , " the doctor said . " We 'll see how it responds before we do anything else . " They gave him a black patch to wear over his eye and told him to come back weekly for checkups , but Sonny hardly listened . Marrying Jacy was all he could think of , and he thought about it on the ride back to Thalia , while his father drove . As soon as they got home Sonny took the extra eye patch the doctor had given him and showed B i l l y how to wear it . Billy was tickled to death . Because Sonny did it , he thought seeing out of only one eye was a great way to see , and from then on he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sweep the town.  |p241JACY  WAS DEAD serious about getting married : the day after Sonny left the hospital they drove to Wichita and got the license . They had to wait three days , so to be doing something Sonny quit his roughnecking job and arranged for a new job pumping leases , something he could do with one eye . The rest of the time he just stayed around the poolhall thinking about sleeping with Jacy . The prospect helped take his mind off his eye . Jacy spent the three days imagining the effect her marriage would have on her parents and on the town . Everybody was curious about Sonny 's eye , which made it absolutely the ideal time to run off with him . Her folks would simply have a fit . Probably they would call the police and have them arrested and torn out of one another'sarms , but at least they would have been married and everyone would know it . Friday afternoon , when it actually became time for them to run away , she wrote her parents a quick note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock to you but I guess it ca n't be helped . Sonny and I have gone to Oklahoma to get married  --  I guess it will be in Altus . Even if he is poor we are in love . I do n't know what to say about college , I guess we 'll just have to talk about that when we get back . We are going to Lake Texoma on outp242honeymoon and will be home Monday . I guess I will live at the poolhall until we find someplace else to live . Even if you do n't like Sonny now I know you will love him someday . JacyShe left the note on the cabinet , propped up against a box of crackers . Gene found it when he came in from work three hours later . Lois was in Wichita that day and returned late . When she came in , Gene was pacing the kitchen floor , obviously distressed . He handed her the note . " Oh , goddamn her , " Lois said . " I ca n't believe it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gene said . " I want to catch ' em . Even if we ca n't get ' em before they marry we can sure as hell get ' em before they go to bed . That way we can get it annulled with no trouble . " " Why bother ? " Lois said . " I suppose we could get it annulled anytime  --  that 's what money 's for . Why do n't we just let her do the getting out  --  you know she wo n't stay with Sonny ten days . I just hate to think of what she 'll do to him in that length of time . If we do n't get that little bitch off to college she 's going to ruin the whole town . " Gene was so upset he could n't take what Lois said . He turned and slapped her , but it was a light , indecisive slap . " You just change your clothes , " he said , shoving her in the direction of the bedroom . " I said we 're going to get ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . What do you mean calling my ( laughter a hitch ? You 're her mother , ai n't you ? " " I do n't see what that has to do with it , " Lois said , but she did n't feel like arguing . She felt sorry for Gene , and pity always made her feel wretched . She already had visions of a horrible scene somewhere in Oklahoma . Shep243stood in the doorway and heard Gene call the highway patrol and ask them to stop Jacy 's car . When he hung up he seemed to feel better . A man should react to siu It an event in a certain way , and he was doing what he should . " I wo n't have her living over no poolhall , not even for ten days , " he said . " Hurry up and get changed , and do n't call my daughter a bitch again . " " No promises , " Lois said . " You know what she 's doing as well as I do , Gene . She does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt us and get a little attention while she 's doing it . What is that but bitchery ? " " Well , she comes by it honest , " he said , looking his wife in the eye . " I know right where she gets it . " Lois merely nodded . " I 'm sure you do , " she said . She obediently went into the bedroom and put on more somber clothes . Sonny and Jacy , meanwhile , were off on the realest of adventures : running away to get married . Jacy had an expensive suitcase and enough clothes to last her a week , while Sonny , who owned no suitcase , had a canvas overnightbag and an extra pair of slacks hung on a hanger in the back seat . They were in the convertible , and Jacy drove . Sonny did n't yet trust himself to drive on the highwaywith one eye . Jacy was wearing a lovely white dress she had bought at Neiman 's the week before , to wear to fraternity parties . She had some new sunglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be running away to get married  --  both of thcni were delighted with themselves . All Sonny had to do was lean back and watch Jacy and imagine the bliss that was going to be his in only a few hours . It was a bright , hot day and there were drops of sweat on Jacy 's t i p p e t lip . Neither of them minded the heat , though . They slopped in Lawton and had milk shakes , probably the last milkp244shakes they would ever have as single people . Both of them were hungry and they sucked up every milky drop . Then they went on to Altus , a popular place for getting married . It was late afternoon when they arrived  --  Sonny stopped at a filling station and asked where they might find a justice of the peace . " Why there 's one right up the road , " the attendant said . " What part of Texas you all from ? " They told him and drove on . It turned out to be absurdly simple to get married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpainted frame house and came to the door in his khakis and undershirt . " Been having myself a little snooze , " he said . " What part of Texas y'all from ? " He surveyed their license casually , got a pencil , licked the point , and filled in what he was supposed to fill in . Sonny would have preferred him to use a fountain pen , since pencil erased so easily , but he did n't say anything . " I better go get Ma to witness , " he said , belching . " I guess I could put a shirt on too , if I can find one . " " Get many marriages up here ? " Sonny asked , to be polite . " Not as many as I 'd like , " the J.P . said . " Not like I used to when we was a Christian country . Used to be people feared God , but not no more . I do n't marry half as many kids as I used to  --  fornication do n't mean nothing anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never think of niarryin ' . What decent ones is left is mostly hifalutin ' kids , church wcddin 's and recepshuns and such as that . Ma ! Got some customers . " An old woman wearing a sunbonnet and gray work gloves came in front the backyard . She was a thin little woman and looked tired , but she nodded politely . " Pardon this getup , " she said . " I was out gettin ' the last of my black-eyes . Garden 's just about gone for this year . What part of Texas you all from ? "  |p245The  old man had wandered out , but he came back into the living room buttoning a khaki shirt over his belly . He stuffed the shirttail unevenly into his pants and shuffled over to an old pigeonhole desk to find his service . " Y'all do n't mind if I read this , do you ? " he asked . " I ai n't got a memory worth a damn . " They did n't mind him reading , but Jacy did mind him standing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost made her gag , but he winked at her with mild lechery and seemed to think she found him attractive . " Would n't mind marrying you myself , honey , " he said . " You got more meat on you than Ma has . " " Do n't be sassing , now , " his wife said . " You can wait till I get this sunbonnet off before you start . " He read the service heavily , sometimes stopping to trace his place with a forefinger . When he asked about rings Sonny shook his head . " She 's marryin ' a cheap skate , Ma , " the J.P . said . When it was over Sonny gave Jacy a quick kiss , but she wanted a long romantic one so they kissed for almost a minute while the old lady wandered off to start shelling her black-eyed peas . As soon as they quit kissing the J.P . came over and placed a wet kiss of his own on Jacy 's cheek  --  it made her furious . Sonny gave him a ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah , a cheap skate , " he said . As they left he followed them out on the porch . " Hell , you 've got a collaspable , " he hollered , when they were getting in the car . " Used to be collaspables were twenty dollar weddin 's ever time . Y'all got any fornicatin ' friends down in Texas tell ' ens to cut it out and come up here to see me . I 'll set ' em right with the Lord as cheap as the next man . " " Why he 's just awful , " Jacy said . " I never dreamed they let people like him do marryin ' . " " Anyway , we 're man and wife , " Sonny said , barely able to believe it . At the first stop sign they kissed againp246and wiggled their tongues enthusiastically . Jacy was for going to Lake Texoma to spend their wedding night , and Sonny was agreeable to anything . They left Altus in a high good mood and drove back to Lawton , where they stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacy began to feel a little depressed . A strange thought occurred to her . They were in the parking lot of the restaurant where they were going to eat , so they kissed for a while , as newlyweds should . While they were kissing Sonny got excited and fondled her in a place in which he Was very interested . It was all right for him to do it , of course , but a little later , while she was in the rest room of the steak house , it occurred to her that maybe her parents would n't have the police arrest them after all . Maybe they would just wash their hands of it and go on watching television . It might even be that they thought she ought to live with Sonny , since she had married him . That was a very sobering thought : to think that they did n't love her enough to want to keep her from living over a poolhall . Thinking about it took away her appetite , and though she tried to appear gay she really only picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal and drank it self-consciously . It occurred to Jacy that even if her folks sent the cops they might miss them in the dark , or they might even get to the motel before the cops started looking . The thought depressed her more and more . Sonny noticed that marriage was making Jacy a little nervous , but he supposed it was just worry over her parents . He was sure she would calm down once they got to Lake Texoma . But . the strange thing was , the closer they came to the lake , the more nervous she became . He scooted over next to her and patted her leg , but that just seemed to make her more edgy . When Sonny scooted close to her Jacy really beganp247to feel funny . She realized suddenly that she just did n't want a wedding night with him at all  --  she had been wrong to think she did . She did n't know whether she even wanted to kiss him anymore or not . Kissing someone who just had one eye was kind of creepy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything changed completely . Jacy ceased to feel the least bit nervous . " What part of Texas y'all from ? " the patrolman asked , holding out his hand for Jacy 's license . He flashed a flashlight in their faces . " Newlyweds , ai n't you ? " he said , when they told him where they were from . They admitted it . " Well , better follow me in , " he said . " I think somebody'slookin ' for you . " " But we ai n't done nothin ' wrong , " Sonny said . " Ai n't we got a right to get married ? How can you arrest us , just like that ? " " I ai n't arrestin ' you , " the patrolman said , peeling a stick of chewing gum . " I just want you to come with me , till we find out . I do n't have no idea what you 've got a right to do . " " I guess we better follow him , honey , " Jacy said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just be heartbroken if my folks have done this , " she added , kissing him again lightly as she put the car in gear . The patrolman led them to a jailhouse in Madill . He did n't put them in a cell or anything , but they had to sit in the jail for almost two hours and that was almost as depressing as being in a cell . Jacy realized she was tragicallyin love , and clung to Sonny tightly . They even got in some nice kissing , but in a way it was depressing , at least to Sonny . Jacy 's folks were in Lawton and were coming after her . He could n't figure out the justice of it.  | " I thought anybody had the right to get married , " he said , several times . The patrolman had gone on about his business . There were only two people besides themselves in the whole jail : one was a prisoner and the other was a redheaded jail-keeper named Elmer . " Well you might have the right and you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . I ai n't gon na hold no gun on you , but if you leave you 'll just get caught agin . You might as well wait here as anywhere . If you 're thirsty we got a Coke machine you 're welcome to use . While they were waiting the sheriff came in , a fat , whiteheaded man . He took one look at them and concludedthey did n't have any right to do anything . " Kids , we really ought a lock you up , " he said . " Runningoff from home , making your parents chase all the way up here . I do n't know what the world 's coming to . " Sonny did n't either , but he knew one thing for sure : he was never going to get to sleep with Jacy . They would never be together in an actual bed , not for a whole night or even part of a night . Somehow his whole life had worked out to keep that one thing from happening , and it was the one thing he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would ever get to make love to anyone he cared about , much less to Jacy . In the hot little jail lobby , sitting on the one bench , he could n't even remember why he had ever thought he would get to sleep with her . It disappointed hint terribly and made him feel a little sick and very t it-ed . About ten o'clock Elmer let the one prisoner come in and watch the late movie with him on the jail 's old Magnavox ' 1'V . That was what they were all doing when Lois and Gene arrived . Sonny was so tired by then that he was n't even scared of Gene , even though Gene started yelling at him the minute he stepped through the jailhouse door . " You 're fired , you whelp ! " he said . " What do youp249mean , runnin ' off with my daughter , tellin ' her she 's gon na live over a poolhall ? " He would have gone on , but Elmer cut him off . " Just take him out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I ca n't hear this movie if you bawl him out in here . " It was a Randolph Scott movie , and they had all been sort of enjoying it . As they went out the door Jacy clung to Sonny , crying bitterly . Mrs. Farrow said nothing at all , but Gene was still mad as cats . " I 'll bawl him out all right , " he said . " Think I worked like a dog all my life so my daughter could end up over a poolhall ? " " We was gon na get another apartment , " Sonny said , though they had not actually given the matter much thought . " I bet you was , " Gene said . He grabbed Jacy by the arm and jerked her away from Sonny . " Where 's your car keys , hon ? " he asked . Snuffling , Jacy fished in her purse and handed them to Lois . " It 's a hell of a note , " he said . " Oh shut up and take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm tired of this . " " You bet I will . You take her car . So far as I 'm concernedSonny can walk . " He led Jacy to the Cadillac , got in , and spun the big car off , throwing up dust in the unpaved road that ran by the jailhouse . Lois and Sonny were left standing in the jailyard , by a little cedar bush . It was very quiet all of a sudden , the moon white overhead . " I would like to apologize for all this , Sonny , " Lois said . " It was n't my doings . So far as I 'm concerned you have a perfect right to anything you could get out of Jacy ,  |p250but  I can tell you right now that would n't have been much . " Sonny did n't know what to say . He felt awfully tired , and Lois noticed it . " You 're welcome to ride back with me , " she said . " In fact I 'd enjoy the company . I can understand how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just say so and I 'll give you some bus money . " Mrs. Farrow did n't seem so bad , and Sonny was much too tired to enjoy the thought of waiting for a bus . " I believe I 'll ride with you , " he said . They started back over the same road that Sonny had just driven with Jacy . Mrs. Farrow drove fast , but there was no sign of the Cadillac ahead of them . " Gene 's probably driving ninety , " she said . " I bet he 's telling Jacy it was all my fault and his , for not loving her more or something . " Sonny did n't know whether he napped or not , but soon they were almost back to Lawton . The wind whipped Mrs. Farrow 's hair about her face just as it had Jacy 's , when they were driving up . To the west , toward the plains , there were low flashings of lightning and the rumble of thunder . Somewhere over near Frederic it was raining . Sonny noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then . " Here , " she said , holding it out to him . " Have a little bourbon  --  you call have the rest of it , in fact . I 've got to drive . It might pick you up . " Sonny took the flask and sipped from it . The whiskey was very sharp on his tongue , but he kept the flask and continued to sip , and after a time he felt a vagueness spreading through him that was almost comfortable . He was surprised to find Mrs. Farrow so likable . " Not much of a wedding night , is it ? " she said . She grinned at him , but it was not an insulting grin.  | " No , not much of one , " he said . " Let me tell you something you wo n't believe , Sonny . You 're lucky we got her away from you as quick as we did . Even if you had got to a motel room she 'd have found some way to keep from giving it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something . You 'd have been a lot better off to stay with Ruth Popper . " Sonny was startled . " Does everybody know about that ? " he asked . " Of course , " Lois said . " It sounded like a good thing to me . You should n't have let Jacy turn your head . " " She 's prettier , " Sonny said . " I guess I should n't have though . I do n't guess I can go see Mrs. Popper any more . " " I should n't imagine . I would n't have you back if you 'd left me for Jacy , but then you never know . I 'm not Ruth . " They turned south out of Lawton . The bourbon was going down easier and easier . In the west the lightning flashes were closer together , and in the moments of light they could see heavy clouds low over the plains . " I hope we do n't have to put this damn top up , " Lois said . She found herself moved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully and looked almost comicallyyoung . Giving way to an impulse , she reached over and touched his neck . It startled him a great deal . " Did n't mean to scare you , " she said . " I guess I just felt motherly for a second . Or maybe I felt wifely , I do n't know . It 's strange to have a married daughter who would n't go through with her wedding night . " Sonny looked at her curiously and she smiled at him , an honest , attractive smile , as she kept stroking the bat k of his neck lightly . He drank more bourbon and watched the intermittent lightning yellow the plains . Ile felt as though life was completely beyond him . In a little while they crossed Red River , the slat , ofp252their tires echoing off the old stone bridge abutments . The water in the channel was shallow and silvery . " Anyhow , I know why Sam the Lion liked you , " Sonny said , and it was Lois ' turn to be startled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked me ? Gene-vieve ? " Sonny nodded . Lois was silent for a moment . " No , it was more than that , " she said . " He loved me , honey . " They were silent almost to Burkburnett , but Sonny noticed that Lois kept wiping her eyes with the backs of her hands . " I get sad when I think about Sam for long , " she said in explanation , her voice unsteady . " I can still remember his hands , you see . Did you know he had beautiful hands ? " They passed by Shepherd Field , with its flickering , rotating airplane beacons and its rows of dark narrow barracks . " I think he was the only man in that whole horny town who knew what sex was worth , " Lois said , her voice a little hoarse . " I probably never would have learned myselfif it had n't been for Sam . I 'd be one of those Amity types who thinks bridge is the best thing life offers womankind . Gene could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then they were coining down on the lights of Wichita . " Sam the Lion , " Lois said , smiling . " Sam the Lion . Nobody knows viler ( ' he got that name but me . I gave it to him one night  --  it just came to me . He was so pleased . I was twenty-two then , call you imagine ? " Then suddenly her shoulders began to shake and she did a strange thing . She wheeled the convertible off the highway in a screech of brakes and stopped on the hill across from the auction barn . She scooted across the seat and grabbed Sonny 's arms , tears running down her face.  | " But you know somethin ' , " she said , her whole body shaking . " It 's terrible to only find one man your whole life who knows what it 's worth , Sonny . It 's just terrible . I would n't be tellin ' you if it was n't . I 've looked , too  --  you would n't bu-lieve how I 've looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lion was seventy years old he could just walk in . . . I do n't know , hug me and call me Lois or somethingan ' do more for me than anybody . He really knew what I was worth , an ' the rest of them have n't , not one man in this whole country .... " She lay against Sonny 's chest and cried very hard , her face hidden . He put his arms around her and waited . He felt so tired that he could be calm through anything . After a while Lois ' body quit heaving . She slipped her hand inside his shirt and touched his chest , and when she finally sat up her face was quite calm . In fact there was somethingalmost gay in her face . " Hey , " she said . " I like you . I do n't know if you know what I 'm worth or not , but I sure like you and I should like you to have a nicer wedding night than Jacy could ever have given you . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Okay ? You 're not scared of me , are you ? " " No , " Sonny said , though he was . But he was glad to go with her , scared or not ; he would have gone with her anywhere , just to see what she would do next , what crazy thing life would bring next . Lois got back behind the wheel and drove to a big motel on the Henrietta highway , one Sonny had passed many times . He had certainly never dreamed he would be going into it with Jacy 's mother , on his wedding night . Lois paid for a room and got the key . ' i'hey were right at the back of the court , and she had a little trouble getting the key in the lock . " Gene and Jacy are home 110 V , wondering why we 're driving so slow , " she said . She went in and Sonny followed her . She turned on a small bedp254light and raised her hands to her throat to unclip a black necklace she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'll tell them we had a flat and had to get it fixed in Lawton . It 's amazing how many good excuses there are . " She was undressing , gracefully and without embarrassment , but she stopped a moment to set the bed lamp on the floor . Her breasts were bare  --  she was the first fullbreastedwoman Sonny had seen naked . " I like a little light but I do n't like it in my eyes , " she said . With the lamp on the floor the room was mostly in shadow . As Sonny hesitantly undressed , Lois came and stood quietly by him , smiling , occasionally reaching out to stroke his shoulder or arm or chest . " Shy young men are lovely , " she said , smiling . He thought her breasts were what was lovely . When they lay on the bed he quickly reached to caress her , but Lois caught his hands and held them for a moment in the valley between her breasts . She raised up on one elbow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her lips before she spoke . " muscles are all tight . " She put her hand on his arms , then on his thigh muscles . Sonny knew they were tight . " You 're scared of use because I 'm Lois Farrow , " she said . " I 'm rich and mean , all that . What everybody thinks of me . But that 's not true for you . I may be that way with a lot of men because that 's what they want and deserve , but it 's still not true . Sant . . . the Lion knew I was n't any of that , and I want you to know it too . See my hand ? It 's not like that , and hands are what 's real . Put yours right here on my throat . " Sonny did  --  her throat was warm , and she lowered her face and kissed hirn . After a while she took his hand offp255her throat and played with his fingers , kissed them . She kissed him and played with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became as serious and playful as she was . She seemed really glad to be with him , crazy as it was . What surprised him most was the lightness of her movement  --  herbody was heavier than Ruth 's , yet she seemed weightless , so light and easy that they might have been floating together . He came right away , without rememberingher at all , and it was only a little later , when he did remember , that he wondered if he had come too soon . She seemed secretly pleased , even delighted , and she took his hands again . They played a little more  --  Lois continued to touch him lightly with her lips or her fingers . " You 've got a big inferiority complex you ought to cure yourself of , " she said . A little later she spoke again . " It 's not how much you 're worth to the woman , " she said quietly . " It 's how much you 're worth to yourself . It 's what you really can feel that makes you nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God , it 's two , " she said . " I guess I better tell them we had a flat and had to walk to Lawton . " She giggled a little and raised her arms to lower her slip over her head . " The excuse never sounds quite so good afterward , " she added lightly . She walked over and asked Sonny to button her dress , and then watched him strangely while he put on his shirt . " Your mother and I sat next to one another in the first grade , " she said . " We graduated together . I sure did n't expect to sleep with her son . That 's small town life for you . " She . grinned and stroked his chest again as he buttoned his shirt . " What will we be ? " he asked , when she stopped at the poolhall to let him out . " Very good friends for a long time , " Lois said . " Even I could n't get away with taking on my ( laughter 's ex/husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do you look so sad ? You 're fine , Sonny . " " I was just thinking of Mrs. Popper , " he said . " I guess I treated her terrible . " " I guess you did , " Lois said . He sat in the car a moment longer and then looked at her gratefully . Ile started to speak but Lois slipped partly across the scat and covered his lips with her palm . When he closed his nioutlr she took her palm away and kissed him . " Do n't ever say thank you to a woman , " she said . " They 'll kill you if you do . You let the ladies say thank you . "  |p257THE  NEXT MORNING Sonny woke up feeling in love with Lois Farrow , but by the time a long week had passed he was back to missing Jacy and wishing he had been able to stay married to her . One night at the cafe Genevieve told him Lois had asked her to tell him they had taken Jacy to Dallas and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not improve his spirits . " What do you think about it all ? " he asked Genevieve . " I do n't know about it all , " Genevieve said , " but the one thing that stands out nice and clear is that Lois ' little girl took you for a nice ride . Boys in this town do n't seem to have much sense when it comes to girls like her . " While they were talking all the football boys trooped into the cafe , laughing and cutting up . They were making a big thing of how sore and bruised they were  --  the first workout had been that afternoon . They played the jukeboxand sat around talking about what a horse 's ass the coach was . Sonny felt left out and even more depressed . He had always been on the football team and had done the same things they were doing after workouts , but suddenly he was n't on the team and the boys did n't even notice him , he might have been out of high school ten years . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funny movie with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis . The movie took his mind off things , but afterward , when he was buying a bag of popcorn from Old Lady Mosey , he got another disappointment . She told him they were going to have to close the picture show sometime in October . " We just ca n't make it , Sonny , " she said . " There was n't fifteen people here tonight , and a good picture like this , Jerry Lewis . It 's kid baseball in the summer and school in the winter . Television all the time . Nobody wants to come to shows no more . " Sonny said he would be sorry to see the place go , and it was true . He went outside and sat on the curb , waiting for Billy to get through sweeping out . Since Sam 's death Billy had grown nervous and restless , and was only really happy when he was with Sonny . If Sonny was n't there to meet him after the show , he would go sweeping off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in the habit of being there . He and Billy would go walking together , Billy carrying his broom and occasionally sweeping at a leaf or a paper cup someone had thrown out . Sometimesthey walked as far as the lake . Sonny would sit and watch the water while Billy swept the dam . Once a week Sonny went to Wichita to have the doctorlook at his eye , but the doctor seldom told him anythingnew. " hooks like sometime this fall I 'll have to send you to Dallas . Better he saving your money . If the doctor down there decides to operate it 'll cost you plenty . " So far as Sonny was concerned the Wichita doctor was costing plenty himself , but for once money was not too big a worry . His pumping job paid him enough to live on and he was able to put what the poolhall brought in in the bank . The pumping job was a lonely kind of job , but that was okay : he was not in the mood for people anyway . He spent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going from one lease to the next , checking the rod lines , greasing the pumps and motors . Often hep259took Billy with him  --  Billy loved to go . When clove season came around Sonny bought a shotgun , an old L. C. Smith .12 gauge singleshot ; occasionally , to Billy 's surprise , he would take a shot at a dove or a jackrabbit , but the seldom hit anything . He thought about Ruth a good deal , always painfully . After football season started he thought about her even more  --  Coach Popper 's name was on every tongue . It looked like Thalia was finally going to win the district , and opinion was divided as to whether the team owed its success to the coach 's coaching or to Bobby Logan 's quarterbacking . Sonny felt strangely reluctant to go to the games , and stayed home from the first three or four . He felt a little guilty about not going , but somehow he just did n't want to . Finally , in early October , the game with Chillicothe came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game that seemed likely to decide the conference crown  --  custom demanded that every male in Thalia go . At first Sonny enjoyed himself , and regretted having missed so many games . The night was cool and clear and the grass on the football field looked greener and softer than it ever had when he played . The assistant coach asked him and Jerry Framingham to run the first-down chain , and they accepted . When the band played the Thalia school song it was a little thrilling : it touched something in Sonny and made him feel as though he was part of it again , the high school , football , the really important part of life in the town . It would have been better if he had never felt that way , because as soon as the game started he realized he was not part of it at all . Bobby Logan was part of it , and Coach Popper was very much part of it . He strode up and down the sidelines , scowling fiercely at the referees  --  everyone knew the coach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the freshmen and sophomores on
