By car and elevated train and on foot , from babies in prams to oldsters in wheelchairs , the West Berliners flooded through the Wall to visit relatives living in the Eastern zone , now accessible during four holiday seasons each year under the pass agreements negotiated last September . Young and old lugged huge baskets filled with fruits , candies , coffee , tea , sugar and liquors-all in short , or ersatz , supply in Communist East Germany . On the Western side accumulated intended gifts that the surly Vopo guards would not allow through : books , records , TV equipment , film , photographs of any kind-even color slides of family outings . <P> East German Puppet Boss Walter Ulbricht had devised a new welcome for the Westerners . At green money-changing kiosks erected for the occasion , each visiting Berliner was dunned 75 in West German marks as the price of admission to his domain . With some 1,000,000 visitors expected during the two weeks the Wall will be open , Ulbricht stands to net $750,000 in much-needed hard currency .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
