The Romans , always alert to omens and portents , would never have gone through with the ceremony . A tremendous mountain storm sent vengeful bolts of lightning slashing across the slopes of Mont Blanc , and their thunderclaps shook the valleys below . The helicopter bearing Charles de Gaulle had to grope its way in heavy fog through the pass to Chamonix , and a nagging rain dropped a chill in the air . <P> <P> Despite these problems , De Gaulle and Italian President Giuseppe Saragat snipped two symbolic ribbons one morning last week to open the world 's longest auto tunnel ( 7 miles ) under Western Europe 's highest mountain ( 15,781 ft . ) . Then they climbed into Saragat 's Fiat limousine and drove from France through the mountain to the Italian town of Courmayeur . After thousands of years of wishful thinking , eight decades of frustrated planning and six hard years of toil , Europe 's greatest physical barrier had been conquered . <P> <P> Two Views . Not so the political barriers , which had kept the tunnel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to build it , until 1953 , when France and Italy signed a formal agreement to begin work on it . Although both De Gaulle and Saragat last week bravely hailed the event as a milestone toward European political unity , they were , as usual , talking about two different Europes . <P> For Saragat , a devout advocate of the Common Market , the tunnel was a major link uniting " the six European nations that live in the same human and idealistic climate , " i.e. , the Common Market . Such restrictions were not for De Gaulle , who saw it as a step toward his great vision of a Europe united from the Urals to the Atlantic-and independent of the U.S. " Now we are showing peace , " he intoned , " and one day this peace will spread from Western Europe to the whole Continent . Then all of Europe will be a factor of capital importance in keeping the world in peaceful balance . " <P> <P> Polite Plea . It was not a day for unity . The very ceremony at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensions . Perhaps miffed at the absence of the Swiss President , De Gaulle had refused to allow a low-level delegation from Switzerland-which donated 2% of the tunnel 's cost-to take part in its inauguration . He even denied the Swiss access to the tunnel , the only link between the ribbon-cutting ceremonies on the French side and the speeches on the Italian . Small wonder that one passionate European Federalist in the audience found the session disturbing enough to break through police lines and fling an envelope toward De Gaulle . As Italian carabinieri hauled him brusquely away , De Gaulle opened the envelope . Inside was a politely worded plea to both Presidents on behalf of European unity . <P> None of the political problems , however , could obscure the very real triumph that the day was meant to observe . The two-lane Mont Blanc tunnel , air-conditioned and equipped with ultramodern radar traffic control , will shorten the road between Paris and Rome by 125 miles-even more when the long winter snows close the Alpine passes . It is expected to be used by at least 1.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolls ranging from $3.25 ( for a small European car ) to $20 ( for a bus ) . Just before its Italian entrance , a proud new road sign told the essential fact : FRANCE , 15 KILOMETERS.
