txt Ignoring the general Congressional clamor for budget cuts , the Senate passed today a $4.77-billion public works money bill after refusing to trim it sharply . The House , meanwhile , grappled with another economy problem : Whether to grant some two million Federal employes their 15th pay increase in 22 years , and if so in what form and how much . The outlook is for House approval late tomorrow of the pay increase , coupled with an increase in postal rates . Senate approval of the big public works appropriation bill ? including funds for the socalled " pork barrel " projects involving rivers , harbors and flood control ? came on a vote of 82 to 3 . The Three Opponents The negative votes were cast by Senators William Proxmire , Democrat of Wisconsin , and John J. Williams of Delaware and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina , both Republicans . Earlier , the Senate rejected , 54 to 27 , a move to trim $248-million from the bill . Voting for the cutback were 16 Republicans and 11 Democrats ; voting against were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate , the bill tops the House-passed version by $153-million . Differences will be worked out in Senate-House conference . In addition to appropriating money for river , harbor and flood control projects , the bill contains funds for the Atomic Energy Commission , water pollution control and other programs . In the House , few voices were raised in opposition to the bill that would couple pay rises with increases in ' postal rates . President Johnson had sought separate bills . The House Post Office Committee joined the two proposals and provided pay increases costing $73-million more than those proposed by the President . The bill would raise first class mail from 5 to 6 cents ; postal cards , from 4 to 5 cents ; and air mail , from 8 to 10 cents . It would also substantially increase rates on second and third class mail . The estimated yield would be $885-million a year . In the Senate the postal pay bill is still in committee . The bill would also increase the pay of postal workers by 6 per cent and of other Federal employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would cost about $850-million this fiscal year . In addition , the bill would grant two other pay rises , next July and on April 1 , 1969 . When fully implemented , the cost would be $2.6-billion a year . In the Senate the postal pay bill is still in committee . The House tonight tentatively rejected , by voice vote , proposals that would have killed rate increases on first class mail , postal cards and air mail . By a standing vote of 98 .1.0 50 the House also tentatively approved an- amendment that would place a surcharge on magazines and newspapers that mail more than 500,000 copies Iper issue . The bill provides for a 23 per cent increase in second class , rates , which cover newspapers ' and magazines . Strong efforts will be made ' tomorrow to lop off the sec -1 and and third pay increases . Dozens of other amendments will be proposed , too . However , the House is expected to keep intact the postal increases and to provide pay rises at least for the current fiscal year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? on the basis of recommendations by its conferees ? that the Senate back down on three additions it had made to the $4.95-billion agriculture money bill . Senate increases , on paper at least , totaled 51.57-billion above the amount originally approved by the House . In conference the House members refused to go along . About $1.5-billion of that amount involved a bookkeeping transfer to the Commodity Credit Corporation and thus would have no effect on actual Government spending . If the Senate refuses to accept House demands , the agriculture money bill will go back to conference . Meanwhile , the Johnson Administration was accused today of freezing funds for politically popular programs in an attempt " to badger Congress " into granting a tax increase . " It looks to me as if the President were trying to use these popular programs in order to put the screws on Congress , " said Representative Charles S. Gubser , Republican of California . - The Administration , recently under heavy pressure from Congress to cut spending , froze previously appropriated funds for lower-priority military construction , civil projects involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the pork barrel . " and most construction starts in all Government agencies . Just yesterday , Administra tion officials hinted broadly that the President might also freeze up to $2.2-billion in highway construction funds . Mr. Gubser leveled his charge on Administration tactics during sharp questioning of Secretary of Defense Robert S. by the House Armed Services Committee . Defending the Pentagon freeze on military construction , Mr. said that the order had been prompted by uncertainty over how much money Congress would appropriate . The freeze can be lifted in 30 days , he said , if Congress does not impose spending restrictions on the Pentagon . Elsewhere in Congress , there was loud grumbling today over the possibility of a freeze on highway construction funds . The possibility was expressed to Governors yesterday by Transportation Secretary Alan S. Boyd . The President had ordered a similar lid on highway spending last fall , but he lifted it this year after heavy pressure from Congressmen and Governors . In the House , Representative Fletcher Thompson , Republican of Georgia , accused the Administration of " trickery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutback . His words were echoed , less publicly , in House and Senate cloakrooms .
