For the first time in history , a Pope of the Roman Catholic Church last week received a ranking Soviet leader . The Pope was John XXIII , an intuitive man more concerned with the fate of Catholics back of the Iron Curtain than with scoring political points . The Communist was Izvestia 's Editor Aleksei Adzhubei , who can carry a message directly and informally to Khrushchev because he is married to Khrushchev 's daughter . <P> The warming relationship between Rome and Moscow has lately been a sort of Father Alphonse-Comrade Gaston act . Last September the Vatican invited Russian Orthodox observers to the Ecumenical Council . Last month the Soviet Union released Ukrainian Archbishop Josyf Slipyi from his long years in prison . And last week Editor Adzhubei , clearly working under orders from on high , showed up in Rome for what was billed as a " lecture tour . " <P> Working Atheist . The Soviet embassy informed Msgr . Jan Willebrands of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity ( who had escorted Slipyi out of Russia ) that Adzhubei would like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the Communists would do with that in Italy 's general election next month , refused , and suggested a general audience with other Vatican visitors . Adzhubei rejected that proposal , but the Vatican 's subtle chief of protocol , Msgr . Igino Cardinale , figured out a deft compromise . Since officials of the Balzan Foundation* were scheduled to visit the Pope with the formal announcement that he had won their 1963 Peace Prize , why should not Adzhubei cover the event as a working journalist ? Afterward , it was hinted , a private-but quite unofficial-meeting with the Pope might be arranged . <P> Dressed in dark suit and grey tie , and accompanied by his wife Rada in black veil and grey suit , Adzhubei showed up with other reporters in the Vatican 's gilded throne room , listened as the Pope spoke of the church 's positive neutrality in the cold war , bowed his head when John gave his blessing . " A beautiful speech , " said Adzhubei , who throughout his visit to Rome proudly labeled himself a " confirmed atheist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After other newsmen left , Adzhubei and Rada were ushered into the papal library , there spent 18 minutes alone with John and his interpreter . Adzhubei told the Pope that he was known and admired in Russia as a fighter for peace . John answered that he was only doing God 's will . The Pope recalled his own journeys through the Balkans as a Vatican diplomat . Adzhubei apparently gave the Pope a personal message from Khrushchev , who had instructed the Russian members of the Balzan Foundation to vote the Peace Prize to John , and had sent word that he was delighted after the award was announced . <P>
