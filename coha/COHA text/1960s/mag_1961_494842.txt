Doing Good in Latin America Can the Alliance Make ' Fast Enough Progress ? by Samuel Shapiro Let me jot down the facts in shorthand . The list below classifies the 20 Latin American republics according to per capita national income ; the parentheses show the principal exports of nations receiving more than half their export earnings from two products . For purposes of comparison , per capita annual income in the United States is above $2,200 . Per capita national income less than Sioo Bolivia ( Tin and lead , 71 percent ) Haiti ( Coffee and sisal , 8o percent ) Per capita national income $loo-$199 Brazil ( Coffee and cacao , 64 percent ) Dominican Republic ( Sugar and cacao , 65 percent ) Ecuador ( Bananas and coffee , 75 percent ) Guatemala ( Coffee and bananas , 85 percent ) Honduras ( Bananas and coffee , 70 percent ) Nicaragua ( Coffee and cotton , 73 percent ) Paraguay Peru El Salvador ( Coffee and cotton , 88 percent ) Per capita national income $200-$299 Colombia ( Coffee and oil , 92 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Cuba ( Sugar and tobacco , 83 percent ) Mexico Panama ( Bananas and cacao , 72 percent ) Per capita national income $300-$699 Argentina Chile ( Copper and nitrates , 76 percent ) Uruguay ( Wool and meat , 68 percent ) Per capita national income over $700 Venezuela ( Oil , 92 percent ) These statistics still understate Latin American poverty , because they do not indicate the extremely uneven distribution of national incomes . Most of these SAMUEL SHAPIRO has written on Latin America for The Economist , the Columbia University Forum , American Heritage and the Journal of Inter-American Studies , as well as The New Republic . He teaches history at the University of Michigan . nations have a small group of well-to-do landlords , businessmen , politicians and military officers ; the mere beginnings of a middle class ; and masses of landless peasants and underemployed or unemployed slum-dwellers who exist somehow on incomes measured in pennies . The annual income of Simon I. Patin ? , for example , was for some years as large as the budget of the Bolivian Government ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic , and the Somoza brothers in Nicaragua are larger than the national income of their countries . In Venezuela , the oil boom has created dozens of millionaires and stranded hundreds of thousands of unemployed slum-dwellers on the outskirts of Maracaibo and Caracas . As the statistics show , Venezuela is by far the " wealthiest " nation in Latin America ; but two-thirds of its population is illiterate ; 300,000 farmers are without land ; two percent of the rural population owns 74 percent of the farmland . Despite dollar revenues of ioo million a month , President Betancourt has had to devalue the bolivar , and would be bankrupt without a steady series of emergency loans from abroad . The causes of this poverty in the Americas are , with minor variations , the same . With few exceptions every nation is plagued by misuse of capital , overspecialization in one or two minerals or agricultural products for export , a social structure that is , as Sen. Mike Mansfield puts it , " seriously out of date , " poor roads , railways , bridges and communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are generally authoritarian , unstable , inefficient and corrupt ? sometimes all four at once . Half of Latin America 's school-age children are not in school , and only one in 20 completes a grade school education ; in the mountain regions there are millions of Indians who do not even speak the official language of their country . Given these almost overwhelming problems , complicated by the pressure of a population increase of 2.6 percent a year ? one of the highest of any major area in the world ? we should be able to understand why so many Latin American labor leaders , leftist politicians and young intellectuals are coming to feel that gradual democratic reforms are inadequate , that a Castro-style social revolution is the only way to get moving . While each Latin American country is distinct by reason of local variations in geography and economic development , and by the impact of individual personalities ( always important in Hispanic countries ) , it is possible to classify them according to the political stage they have reached . Readers who are familiar with the intricacies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary blurring of distinctions that such a listing requires . Old Style Caudillo Regimes ? The paternalistic caudillo , a modern counterpart of the medieval duke or count , has been a familiar fixture in Latin America since the wars of independence . He generally owns large tracts of lands , has a share of many basic industries , and runs his country as if it were his personal property . He treats his people like children in need of his constant severe tutelage , and he is often able to pass power on to his sons at his death . This form survives today only in small and backward nations like Paraguay , Haiti and Nicaragua . The situation in the Dominican Republic is still obscure . The Trujillo brothers are out for the moment , but whether they return or who finally wins effective command of the government remains to be seen . The last caudillo to control a major Latin American republic was Juan Vicente Gomez of Venezuela , who died in 1935 . ( The demagogic caudillo , like Argentina 's Juan PerOn , who appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate type . ) The three surviving caudilloships are all shaky . The Kennedy Administration has continued arms shipments to General Stroessrer in Paraguay , renewed an agreement to maintain a Marine training mission in Duvalier 's Haiti , and continues to prop up the threatened regime of Luis Somoza Debayle in Nicaragua ; we deprived the Dominican Republic of its extra share of the Cuban sugar quota only under great pressure , and to the accompaniment of loud protests of Senators Ellender and Smathers . Some of these remaining caudillo regimes have survived for very long periods of time ; the Somoza clan has run Nicaragua since 1937 . But the tide is running strong the other way , and it does not seem likely that any of the caudillos will enjoy a tranquil reign much longer . Conservative Regimes with Some Degree of Political Democracy ? Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , Panama , Ecuador , Chile and Peru fall into this category . Each has more or less passed permanently out of the caudillo stage ; they are ruled by elected presidents , and political opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the hands of oligarchies like the " Twenty Families " of Panama and " La Llamada " ( the so-called aristocracy ) of Peru . In each country a small group monopolizes political and military office , owns most of the available farmland , and fights off popular encroachments upon its power or prestige ; politics tends to be a struggle for position among a few thousand wealthy individuals . There are signs of a desire for radical change in all of these coun- . tries , and popular dissatisfaction is certain to grow . Newly-Established Liberal Regimes ? During the past decade Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , Costa Rica and Venezuela , a group including the most important nations in the area , have emerged from dictatorial rule . In each case , however , the dictator left behind a legacy of waste , extravagant and unproductive public works , an empty treasury , and deepened social cleavages . The fall of the dictators was accompanied by , and perhaps partially caused by , a disastrous decline in commodity prices , so that the overspecialized export economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports rose from IA million bags in 1954 to 17.5 million in 1959 , for example , price declines cut her income from $948 to $750 million ; and Brazil depends on coffee for two-thirds of her foreign exchange earnings . Similar figures could be cited for oil , copper , sugar and a number of other commodities . For Latin America as a whole , export earnings in the single year 1958 fell $700 million , and there is as yet no sign of any substantial recovery . The accidental conjunction of political progress and economic disaster has forced the newly-established and still wobbly democratic regimes to institute austerity programs or turn to inflation , in both cases lowering still further the already low living standards of their people . The largely illiterate and unsophisticated masses have come to associate democracy with soaring prices and hunger ; this accounts for the lingering popularity of former dictators like Odria in Peru , Vargas in Brazil , and PerOn in Argentina . Another problem common to these nations is the continued influence of the military in politics . Costa Rica abolished her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the armed forces still play a dominant role in political life elsewhere . Argentina 's Frondizi , Colombia 's Lleras Camargo , and Venezuela 's Betancourt would like to reduce their countries ' swollen armaments budget ; but the generals forbid it . If they do not institute social reforms , they are menaced by a leftist Castro-style uprising ; if they do , they may be ousted by an officers ' coup . The new liberal presidents won office during the past few years by genuine majorities , but their popularity has been eroded . The nations they rule are swept by waves of strikes , terrorist bombings and armed uprisings , and it is problematical if all of them could win re-election today . These nations are , moreover , the most important ones in South America . Venezuela is the largest exporter of iron ore and crude oil in the world ; Argentina may yet be a minor , and Brazil almost surely a major , world power before the end of the century . Revolutionary Regimes ? Bolivia and Cuba are the only nations in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so evidently doomed to continued poverty by her barren geography , that the MNR ( National Revolutionary Movement ) is not likely to have any great influence outside the Andean plateau where it now rules . The Cuban revolution , on the other hand , taking place in a much richer and more advanced economy , has already had an immense effect on all Latin America . Part of Cuba 's influence is due to the initial success of the revolution in raising the living standard of the farm workers , part of it to the skillful propaganda activities of the barbudos ( bearded ones ) , and part of it to the charismatic figure of Fidel Castro himself . " El Gran Fidel " ( to give him the title of a Cuban propaganda film that has been exhibited throughout Latin America to great applause ) is a typically Hispanic hero ? young , handsome , energetic , brave , a superb orator and a bit of a poet ? a combination of Don Quixote , Bolivar , Lenin and Ruben Dario . If he were assassinated tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latin America ; if he lives , and his revolution survives , he will rank with legendary heroes like the Cid and San Martin . As it goes into its third year , Cuba 's revolutionary government is entering a trying phase , that of consolidating its power in the face of economic troubles and discontent with the growing political power of the Communists . Its future is unpredictable , for it depends largely upon decisions taken in Washington , Moscow and Peking . Post-Revolutionary Regimes ? Mexico and Uruguay are the only Latin American nations that have passed through revolution and emerged with politically durable and relatively prosperous regimes . The revolution in Uruguay , presided over by Battle y OrdOilez and his Colorado party before World War I , was peaceful , and patterned along the lines of the New Deal , which it preceded by a generation . Mexico 's revolution was long and bloody , and there is still violence on election day . But in both nations the armed forces now have little political influence , and in neither has there been any serious attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Latin nations may follow the path of these two , the peculiar one-party system of democracy they have evolved is worth study . The Colorado party of Uruguay ruled uninterruptedly for more than half a century ; the opposing Blancos won an election for the first time in 1958 . The PRI ( Institutional Party of the Revolution ) has played an even more dominant role in Mexican politics ; it hasnever lost an election . Such a party would be considered incompatible with democracy in the United States or Western Europe , but it seems to work fairly well in Mexico . Mexico had an economic growth rate of seven percent last year . Yet even here , as Oscar Lewis points out , " in 196o , over 6o percent of the population are still ill fed , ill clothed , and ill housed , over 4o percent are illiterate , and some 45 percent of the nation 's children are not being schooled . " As I have shown , only two of the zo Latin American republics have developed comparatively stable political institutions , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous . Two other countries are now passing through the fires of revolution , and in every one of the remaining 16 a major social upheaval is either likely or at least possible in the near future . Preceding the actual revolution is the " revolution of rising expectations " : unemployed slum-dwellers and landless farm workers become conscious of how much better life is elsewhere . Symptoms of the approaching storm are the uproar in the universities , the popularity of leftist ideologies among the intellectual and professional classes , and the explosive demonstrations of anti-Americanism from the Rio Grande down to the tip of Cape Horn . Only in the past two years , and in part as a direct consequence of the Cuban revolution , have US policy makers begun realistically to confront these facts and to apply our domestic standard of what is un-American as a way of life to all the Americas . President Kennedy and his advisers , despite their misjudgment in Cuba , clearly do recognize that political stability and economic growth are incompatible with illiteracy , corrupt governments , creaking social structures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced its willingness to join commodity stabilization programs , to make loans to government-owned enterprises , and to provide development funds to any country prepared to " improve its own institutions . " But what a task we have undertaken in the Alliance for Progress ! We have called on Latin America 's ruling classes to give up some of their wealth and special privileges , but we have no way to compel them to do so . We can only promise ? Congress willing ? to reward them if they do reform . The badly-managed and underproductive hacienda , for example , is not just a source of income ; its owner is no more prepared to abandon his way of life voluntarily than the French aristocrat of 1789 or the Southern slaveowner of 1861 . Latin diplomats have gone home from Punta del Este to draw up plans for spending Uncle Sam 's promised largesse , but tax reforms and land distribution schemes have everywhere been delayed or defeated . The Mexican economist Victor Urquidi has estimated that wealthy Latin Americans have sent abroad between THE NEW REPUBLIC $4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately short of capital . Real estate and income taxes are far lower than in the US , and are systematically evaded ; at a recent gathering of hemispheric tax experts in Buenos Aires , it was estimated that effective collection procedures even at present low rates would bring Latin American governments an additional $3 billion in revenue each year . No Latin government except Castro 's has done much to tap these concealed sources of capital . Having got rid of the honest reformer , Janio Quadros , Brazilian politicians have taken up their pleasant old habits of " remunerated recesses , " political jockeying and graft . Despite Mr. Kennedy 's laudable intention to help no nation that does not help itself , we have not yet screwed up our courage to deny Alliance funds even to backward and repressive regimes in Haiti , Paraguay or Nicaragua . Latin America today produces and consumes less food per capita than it did before World War II ; its exports have shrunk steadily in purchasing power since 1954 . And while the Alliance for Progress has been compared to the Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communications network of Europe are not present in Latin America and can not be called into being at will . It would , therefore , be something near the miraculous were Latin America to achieve , soon , the 2.5 percent per capita increase inannual income spoken of by Secretary Douglas Dillon at Punta del Este . One may question also our own readiness to make the hard choices that are required by President ' Kennedy 's program . Can Congress be persuaded to vote funds for education in Brazil or Argentina when it has so far proved unwilling to help build schools in Michigan and Massachusetts ? Will it vote to raise the price of coffee to its constituents ? Can our tariff and quota barriers on Latin American wool , sugar , oil , beef , copper and lead be lowered against the opposition of powerful lobbies ? American businessmen have $9 billion at stake in Latin American mines , factories and plantations ? one-third of our overseas investment ; will we respond to the next revolution against foreign property any more calmly than we did to Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discovered and used , the prospect for any improvement in living standards is bleak ; Eisenhower shied away from this issue , and Kennedy may be no more inclined to face up to it squarely . There are new and noble intentions in Washington that should inspire us with hope . If only there were more time ! Unfortunately , as Jose Figueres has said , " Time is short , Latin America is in a revolutionary mood . It has a great deal to change . It is far too late for a slow-paced revolution .
