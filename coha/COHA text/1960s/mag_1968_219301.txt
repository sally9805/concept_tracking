Despite technical setbacks , and an increasingly tight budget , NASA seems determined to meet the goal set by President Kennedy seven years ago : a manned U.S. landing on the moon during this decade . Last week Apollo 's program director , Lieut . General Samuel C. Phillips , announced a revised schedule that will postpone the manned flight of the glitch-ridden lunar module ( LM ) , and may add a manned flight around the moon to the prelanding missions , yet still place astronauts on the moon before the end of 1969 . <P> <P> NASA is forging ahead with its plans for the first manned test flight of the Apollo spacecraft on Oct. 11 . But a De cember mission , in which astronauts were to have rendezvoused and docked their Apollo command ship with an LM , has been pushed back until February by problems in the Grumman-built module . In place of the LM flight , a manned Apollo flight has now been scheduled for December , the first to be powered by the mighty Saturn 5 rocket . <P> Mascon Troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles of the LM , which is designed to carry two astronauts to the surface of the moon while the third remains in lunar orbit in the Apollo command module . Tests have shown that most of the LM 's troubles are electrical , and technicians at Cape Kennedy are busily rewiring the spacecraft , shielding circuits and replacing switches . <P> The Apollo program has also received a boost from scientists at the Jet Pro pulsion Laboratory , who recently discovered the cause of unexpected variations in the altitude and speed of earlier unmanned lunar orbiters . Such flight deviations , which could drop a module several miles off target , were caused by local increases in lunar gravity brought about by areas of dense material beneath the five circular maria , or " seas . " The concentrations of mass , called " mascons , " may have been caused by the impact of large meteors , which generated enough heat to melt material below the surface of the moon and form regions of high density . <P> Now that NASA is aware of the mas cons , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations , thus eliminating another gnawing worry for the Apollo planners .
