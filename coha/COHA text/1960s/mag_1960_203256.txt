The stock market presented a puzzle . After falling in eleven out of the 15 trading days this year , the Dow-Jones industrials were down 39.62 points from their alltime high of 685.47 on Jan. 5 before leveling off slightly at last week 's end . The big question : Is the drop simply the winter chill that has hit the market along about this time in each of the past three years ( see chart ) , or a sign of something more serious ? <P> Part of the drop was undoubtedly seasonal . January is at best a " peculiar month , " said Walston &; Co. ' s Edmund Tabell . " By the middle of the month , the market generally has taken care of the reinvestment demand generated by year-end tax selling and the market just sits back and relaxes . " But that was not the only reason for the market 's shivers . With short-term Government securities paying 5% , institutional investors were tempted to put somewhat more of their new money into bonds and less into stocks . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed long-term governments up as much as two points above their January lows spent its force . Most of the list dropped back one-quarter to one-half of a point at week 's end . To Tabell , this pointed up a truth : only when the gap between stock dividends and bond yields becomes extreme will investors swing bonds in preference to stocks . <P> Many an analyst thought the market might drift down another 15 or 20 points before finding the base for its next rise simply because , said Sam Stedman , partner in Carl M. Loeb , Rhoades &; Co. , many stocks at their recent highs were overpriced in terms of immediate earnings . To Stedman , the caution was a good sign . " I do n't like it when everyone thinks that all the market can do is go up . " <P> Looking ahead , many analysts saw the market consolidating for an early resumption of its rise . One strong force firmly applying upward pressure was the continued rise in earnings ( see below ) . Said Josephthal &; Co . Partner Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings uptrend which the market is perhaps underestimating at current levels . Personally , I expect much higher individual stock prices in the spring .
