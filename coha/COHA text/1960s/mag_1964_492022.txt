It is less than three months since President Kennedy was murdered . But already now , when we hear the words " the President , " we see in our mind 's eye not the bushy hair and the handsome face of John Kennedy , but the long head and dark face of Lyndon Johnson . Especially since the new session of Congress opened , and the deluge of presidential messages descended on it . Lyndon Johnson has established himself as President in fact as well as name . Thus the great transition  --  the transfer of power from the murdered President to the new President  --  is almost complete . This is a report  --  necessarily fragmentary , like all such reports in the immediate aftermath of a great event  --  on the great transition . The transition started with six terrible words spoken to Lyndon Johnson by Kenneth O'Donnell , President Kennedy 's assistant and close friend . It was ten minutes past one , November 22. 1963 . President Kennedy had been shot at 1230 , Dallas time . Lyndon Johnson , Mrs. Johnson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cubicle near Emergency Operating Room One at Parkland Memorial Hospital . Johnson has remarked since that he can remember nothing about the room except that there was a pile of sheets in a corner , and the walls were painted hospital green . O'Donnell knocked at the door , Youngblood opened it , and O'Donnell stepped inside and closed the door . " The President is dead , Mr. President , " he said . Lyndon Johnson gave his first order as acting President within minutes of hearing O'Donnell 's fateful words . He told Malcolm Kilduff , acting press secretary , to withhold the announcement of President Kennedy 's death until he himself could get out of Parkland Hospital and back to the presidential plane , Air Force One , at nearby Lose Field . As he told Kilduff " We do n't know whether this is a worldw ide conspiracy. , whether they 're after me as they were after President Kennedy .... We just do n't know . " In the weeks that hose passed since President Kennedy 's murder , we hose become accustomed to thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the time , it seemed possible , even probable , that the murder was " part of some international conspiracy . " All the major participants recall feeling that the assassination could hardly be a random episode . that it must he a part of something bigger and more sinister . A few minutes before O'Donnell made his announcement to Lyndon Johnson , Secretary of State Dean Rusk , flying to Japan as head of a delegation of Cabinet officers , was told that the President had been shot . He ordered the plane turned back to Washington , then talked with acting Secretary George Ball . bs radiotelephone , about the possibility that the shooting might be the prelude to some sort of global Pearl Harbor . In Washington Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a message to all combat commands around the world ordering a state of readiness . John McConc , CIA chief , ordered a worldwide " intelligence alert " to pick up the slightest es idenee of hostile Communist intent . There was no in ternational conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that Nikita Khrushehey was stunned by the news  --  when he heard it he broke down and wept . But there might well base been a conspiracy , national or international . Lyndon Johnson 's first order as President therefore displayed remarkable presence of mind The thought that the murder might be part of a plot , perhaps originating in Dallas , was certainly in the mind of Kenneth O'Donnell , back in Emergency Room One . O'Donnell was therefore determined to get the President 's body out of Dallas and back to the White House without delay , at any cost . Aside from O'Donnell and the doctors , nurses and Secret Scrs ice men , the other occupants of the emergency room were the President 's widow , her skirts still stained with his blood , his Air Force aide . Brig . Gen. Godfrey McHugh , and two presidential assistants , La wrence O'Brien and David Powers . O'Brien and Powers , like O'Donnell , were members of the " Irish matia. " ? the little band of men of Irish blood and Massachusetts birth who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kennedy 's appointments secretary and man of all work , is a former Harvard football player , tough , monosyllabic , very able . O'Brien . a professional politician in charge of White House relations with Congress , is a genial redhead with a map-of-Ireland face , Dave Powers has been described as Kennedy 's court jester  --  he is the sort of humorous , easygoing man , always good for a laugh , every President needs around him . These three risen are very different in some ways , but aside from their Irish blood they are alike in one way , All three loved Iohn Kennedy . The late President much disliked any show of emotion , , sod yet he was uniquely capable of inspiring a deep emotional attachment in those around him . This feeling which Kennedy inspired is an intrinsic part of the story of the great transition , for it complicated  --  and still complicates  --  the task of his successor . It also helps explain certain of the small episodes that occurred in the wake of his murder . One such episode took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hearse had been hired , a bronze coffin found , and the President 's body was about to be moved to the held , w hen an unexpected hitch developed . A functionary appeared in the corridor outside Emergency Room One with a couple of minions and loudly asserted that the President 's body could not be moved . Regulations , he announced , required an autopsy before a body could be moved  --  the autopsy would require five or six hours . A doctor expostulated that this was , after all , a special case . With the mindless self-importance of the petty bureaucrat , the official replied , " As far as we 're concerned , this is just another homicide case . " No lime tor argument Kenny O'Donnell , thin-lipped , turned to the Secret Service men and gave an order : " We 're getting out of here . " The President 's shattered body was placed in the coffin . The coffin was carried out to the waiting hearse with Mrs. Kennedy walking beside it , her hand resting on it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secret Service men and the Dallas police cleared the way . Luckily for him , the nameless functionary made no attempt to bar the way . When the President 's widow and his friends arrived at Love Field with the coffin , they found Lyndon Johnson already on the plane , with the window shades drawn against the danger of a second assassination attempt . With Johnson were Mrs. Johnson and , among others , Jack Valenti , a short , genial man who has been described as " Lyndon 's Dave Powers , " Rep. Homer Thorn-berry , an old Texas friend , and Bill ( not William ) Movers . Moyers is another key figure in the story of the great transition . He is very young , very intelligent and very close to Lyndon Johnson , for whom he has worked on and off since he was in his teens . IThe relationship between the two is suggested by the fact that Moyers slept in a large closet in the Johnson hotel suite during the 1960 Los Angeles convention . ) Long before President Ken nedy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Peace Corps , had gotten to know the Kennedy people well . They liked and respected him , and Moyers acted as a sort of bridge between the two groups during the great transition . When they arrived at Love Field , O'Donnell , O'Brien , Powers and McHugh were desperate to get away from hated Dallas . When they were told that Lyndon Johnson had given orders to delay the takeoff , they were furious  --  General McHugh. according to one report ( he refuses to discuss the matter ) even had some very harsh words to say to Lyndon Johnson himself . But they calmed down quickly when they heard that it was Robert Kennedy who had advised Johnson to delay the takeoff until a judge could be found to swear him in as President . Johnson had telephoned the Attorney General for advice as soon as he arrived at Love Field . Kennedy asked for five minutes to think , then called back to tell Johnson that he should be sworn in before takeoff . Robert Kennedy too was haunted by the thought that his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis . It was therefore essential that there be no doubt about the new President 's authority  --  above all , his unique authority to order the use of nuclear weapons . As this suggests , Robert Kennedy was also a key figure  --  in a sense , the key figure  --  in the great transition . Almost without speaking a word , he might have made the transition immensely difficult for the new President . Instead , he did what he could to make the transition period as easy as possible for his brother 's successor , even during the first weeks when he was sick with grief . After the brief flare-up had subsided , there were a few minutes to wait until Lyndon Johnson 's old friend Judge Sarah Hughes arrived to swear him in . Inevitably , in the face of tragedy so overwhelming , what little was said sounded inadequate , inane . Moyers remembers saying to Larry O'Brien , " This is so awful I just do n't know what to say . " O'Brien replied , " Makes you wonder about public service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as President , Mrs. Kennedy went to the rear compartment where her husband 's body lay , and Moyers followed , to ask if he could help , He came up to her as she leaned against the compartment door , looking down at the coffin , and he heard her murmur to herself : " It 's going to be so long and so lonely . " Then she turned , saw Moyers and asked him to ask " Kenny and Larry and Dave " to join her . The President 's three old companions-in-arms went to the rear compartment , and the door was closed . When the coffin had been put on the plane , all but two seats had been removed . So the President 's three friends stood throughout the flight . The plane took off at 2:47 P.M. in the front compartment , for at least 10 minutes after takeoff , the new President sat 18 uncharacteristically silent and immobile . Then he reached for a Scratch pad headed ABOARD AIR FOHUE Otir and begun to scribble busily . " I want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pad to Moyers . The words he had scribbled on the pad viere , in substance , the brief and simple words he spoke to the television cameras and the waiting world when Air Force One landed in Washington . ( " I will do my best . That is all 1 can do . I ask for your help and God 's . " ) The statement out of the way , he made two sympathy calls , to Mrs. Rose Kennedy and to Mrs. John Connally. w de of the wounded governor of Texas . and then he got down to business . He ordered that Secretary of Defense McNamara , acting Secretary of State George Ball and Presidential Assistant McGeorge Bundy meet him at Andrews Air Force Base and fly with him by helicopter to the White House . Thereafter , that evening if possible , he wanted to meet with both the congressional leaders and with the Cabinet . And so the new President took command , making decisions , giving . orders , exercising the great powers of his office . as he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force Base near Washington at six P.N1 . Robert Kennedy met the plane , and he and Mrs. Kennedy , with O'Donnell , O'Brien and Powers , took the dead President 's body to Bethesda Naval Hospital , w here it was prepared for burial . After making his statement , the new President climbed into a helicopter with Mrs. Johnson . McNamara , Bundy and George Ball  --  whowas substituting for the still-airborne Rusk  --  for the short to the ' A hire House taw n . Above the whirring of the blades , Johnson made a little speech . E ? en if he had been nominated and elected in 1960. he said , he could not have attracted to his Administration men of such caliber as President Kennedy had recruited . " I need you all , - he said " I need you more than he needed you. - Those words ? " I need you more than he needed you " ? were to become a Johnsonian theme song throughout the great transition . From the very first  --  and in contrast to every previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson made an extraordinary effort to retain the whole of John F. Kennedy 's Cabinet and White House staff intact . There is a simple reason why he did so . Johnson is not given to false modesty , and when he told the Kennedy men , " I need you more than he did , " he was telling the plain truth . President Kennedy left behind him a brilliant staff , ready-made . The new President could not conceivably have recruited such a staff in a few weeks or months . A President is made or unmade by the men around him Above all things , Lyndon Johnson wants to be ranked by history among this country 's great Presidents . There was another reason why Johnson made so Herculean an effort to keep the Kennedy men at his side . It was suggested by three rhetorical questions which Johnson posed to the Republican and Democratic congressional leaders , who trooped into his old offices in the Executive Office Building that night . First , the new President asked , what would the Soviet leaders think ? They must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened from within , disintegrating . Second , what would " we ourselves " think ? Will we be proud of the way we served our country in time of danger ? Third , and above all , what would the American people think ? They must see not weakness and indecision , but order , stability , continuity . Even if there had been a general exodus of the Kennedy men , the transition would have been accomplished somehow . But the sense of continuity which Johnson was determined to establish would have been all but destroyed . And there was , of course , still another reason why Lyndon Johnson was so determined to keep the Kennedy men . As Johnson himself is fond of pointing out , " You 've got to get your election certificate before you can be a statesman . " In his drive for election in his own right next November , Johnson 's single greatest asset is the memory of his predecessor . If the men around Kennedy had immediately left him  --  especially if they had left him in anger  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the day of the murder , after the meeting with the congressional leaders , Johnson went back with Bill Moyers to his big house in the Spring Valley section of Washington . Lady Bird Johnson , daughter Lucy , the faithful Jack Valenti and Texas friends Horace Busby and Cliff Carter were gathered in the comfortable terrace room . Johnson demanded a glass of fresh mineral water  --  he has a fetish about mineral water , insists that it be absolutely fresh  --  then held the glass up to a colored photograph of his old friend and mentor , the late House Speaker Sam Rayburn , and drank a small toast : " Well , Mr. Rayburn , 1 certainly wish you were here now . " Mrs. Johnson suggested bed , but Moyers , Carter and the President talked , and the two younger men scribbled memoranda about things that had to be done , people who had to be seen . " We really have a big job to do now , " the President said several times . By the end of the next day , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing attention to detail which Johnson would take to his " big job " were very much in evidence . There was a briefing by CIA chief John McCone , a Cabinet meeting , a visit to President Kennedy 's casket , lying in state in the East Room , innumerable telephone calls in the name of national unity to such leaders of the American Establishment as labor leader George Meany and industrialist Frederick Kappel . But Johnson 's day both started and ended with his now almost obsessional effort to retain John Kennedy 's White House staff . White House press secretary Pierre Salinger had been in the plane which turned back over the Pacific . At about six in the morning , after prayers over the dead President 's coffin , Salinger had gone to bed in a White House guest room , at Mrs. Kennedy 's invitation . At 7:55 the telephone rang . President Johnson was on the line . He told the sleepy 20 Salinger that he knew how he must feel , how close he had been to President Kennedy .. But , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as press secretary . Then the theme song : " I need you more than he needed you . " That evening Theodore Sorensen , President Kennedy 's speech writer , White House counsel , and alter ego , heard the same theme song . For an hour and a half , in Johnson 's vice-presidential offices in the Old State Department building , Sorensen and the new President talked . Sorensen gave the President a list of I I matters  --  such as the cancellation of a forthcoming meeting of the Democratic National Committee  --  which had to be dealt with . But most of the hour and a half was devoted to Johnson 's appeal to Sorensen to stay on , Sorensen did not commit himself . But he made one remark which foreshadowed his eventual decision to leave the White House , to write a book about the dead President . " I 've given eleven years of my life to John Kennedy , " he said , " and for those eleven years he was the only human being that mattered to me . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men around the President felt much the same way about John Kennedy . It would have required only a little lack of tact , a brusqueness , an insensitivity , on Johnson 's part to arouse in these men who had loved John Kennedy a Hamlet-like hatred : So excellent it king ; that was , I ' this . Hyperion to 0 satyr .. . Johnson has not always been famous for tact , which makes his role during the transition all the more remarkable Sorensen , O'Donnell , O'Brien and the others were under a terrible strain during those first days , and it is perhaps to be wondered at that none of them cracked under the strain . But they were not the only men who were under a strain . Lyndon Johnson is a human being too . Horace Busby , a square-faced , quiet Texan , has worked for Lyndon Johnson off and on since 1946 , and he is one of Johnson 's half dozen closest personal friends . Until the Johnsons moved into the White House on December 7 , Busby came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new President 's insistence , for a relaxing chat before the President went to bed . A President 's insomnia On Saturday evening , after he had had his talk with Sorensen , Johnson went home and had a massage in his bedroom while Bushy sat in a chair by the bed , and the two men chatted . After the massage , at about 10 o'clock , the President put out the light , but he asked Busby to stay in the room for a while , until he went to sleep . Busby obediently stayed in his chair , until he thought he detected sounds of sleep from the President 's bed . Then he tiptoed quietly toward the dour . He had just reached it when he heard the President 's voice : " Bus ... But . You still there ? " Busby returned to his chair . Later , and then later again , Busby tried to tiptoe out , only to be stopped by the President 's " Buz , . Buz ... " He finally made good his escape at two o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working for Johnson , in his effort to keep the Kennedy staff intact , was a simple fact  --  the Kennedy men had a job to do . McGeorge Bundy was hard at work the morning after the murder . briefing the new President , supplying him with CIA-prepared biographies of the visiting chiefs of state , doing other chores . Pierre Salinger held two long press briefings on Saturday , the day after Kennedy 's assassination , and two more briefings on Sunday . By Monday , the day of the funeral , Sorensen was also hard at work drafting the speech which President Johnson would make to the joint congressional session on Wednesday . Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , Kennedy 's **25;2360;TOOLONG had heard the Johnsonian theme song on Sunday . t " He knew a lot more about history and the things you know about than I do  --  t need you more than he did . " ) On Monday , after writing a eulogy of President Kennedy for this magazine , Schlesinger went to work organizing the late President 's papers . Larry O'Brien was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would have scuttled the wheat deal with the Soviets , was due for a vote immediately , and on Monday , after the funeral , O'Brien got together with his staff to make a head count . The next morning , O'Brien went to the Capitol to confer with the Senate Democratic leaders , Senators Mike Mansfield and Hubert Humphrey . His tally agreed with theirs-56 sure votes against . O'Brien recalls with a craftsman 's pride that his count was off by only one vote . O'Brien also recalls a queer feeling which overcame him , sitting in MansField 's office , " Suddenly I could n't believe I was there and the President was dead , " he said . " ' This is a nightmare , ' I sJid to myself . ' It ca n't be real . ' " In retrospect . O'Brien is glad he had a Job to do , a job that had to be done . So are the others . " It kept us sane , " one of the Kennedy men recalls . It also kept them working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first major turning point in the great transition Has President Johnson 's address to the joint session of Congress on Wednesday , November 27 . Johnson , as Kennedy had been accustomed to do , invited O'Brien , Sorensen and Salinger to ride with him up to the Capitol . In the car the new President . whose extrasensory , ' perception is sometimes magical , correctly sensed that Sorensen was not happy about the speech . There had ( seen several drafts . Former Ambassador to India Kenneth Galbraith had produced one  --  and he was decidedly miffed when hardly a word of it appeared in the final version . There were various Cabinet versions , and both Adlai Stevenson and Horace Bushy had also produced drafts . Sorensen 's first draft had been a moving eulogy of the late President . Johnson admired it , but he sensed that parts of it needed to be rewritten in his own style , and he also decided that the speech must look to the future as well as to the past . Sorensen was unhappy with the speech , not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  but because he did not have final editing responsibility , and as a result he considered the speech repetitious and poorly organized On the short ride to the Hill the following colloquy : , or something sery like it , occurred : JOHNSON Imollifyingly. to O'Brien and Salingeri : " This is a tine S peech  --  ind it 's ninety percent Sorensen , only ten percent Johnson , " SoRENsos : " No , sir . thaws not accurate  --  not more than Mt ! , percent Sorensen . " JOHNS.C.N " Well , an ? , 55a , , . our fifty percent is the best . " SORENtit NI " On that point , Mr. President . I emirely agree . " The four men laughed . Althoueh the relationship of the Kennedy men to Johnson was not then , is not now and never will be the same as their relationship to Kennedy . ihe hole episode suggests that even then there were the beginnings of an easy human relationship Despite Sorensen 's doubts , the speech accomplished a great object . In the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mehtmare sense of unreality which Larry O'Brien suffered in Mike Mansfield 's office . Johnson 's speech ended the nightmare . brought the country back to reality . It was a moving tribute to the dead , but it was also a reminder to the loing that life must go on , and that the United States still had a government and a President . On the day after President Kennedy 's murder . Kenneth O'Donnell went to his office in the VS bite House and packed his papers and personal belongings neatly in a boy . Then he left the White House . He did not expect to return , and he did not return for more than a week . ith no job to do , those must have been very bad days for O'Donnell But on the Monday after Thanksgiving the President asked him to a morning meeting at the White House with O'Brien and Sorensen . t that meeting , while Sorensen remained noncommittal  --  he only said , " I 'm still here , Mr. President " ? O'Brien and O'Donnell agreed to stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave one reason why it was so difficult to refuse the new President : " When I saw him charging into the fray , I 'd have felt like an s.o.h. if I had n't charged in with him . It 's what Jack Kennedy would have wanted , " There , was another reason why O'Brien and O'Donnell stayed on . If Robert Kennedy had resigned soon after the assassination , it is virtually certain that the whole Irish mafia , most of the rest of the White House staff and perhaps some Cabinet officers , too , would have left . Thus the continuity which the new President wanted maintained would have been destroyed . And the inevitable rumors of a Kennedy-Johnson rift would have hurt Johnson badly  --  perhaps fatally  --  nest November Johnson from the first made it very clear that he wanted Robert Kennedy to stay , but his estrasensory perception warned him not to press too hard . In fact . Kennedy had all but made up his mind to slay , even before his brother was buried , for he . too . had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But for seseral weeks after the murder the President 's brother was half-stunned with grief . It was not until the first week in January. , after a Colorado vacation , that the tough Kennedy will prevailed over grief , and Robert Kennedy 's decision was solid and final . The great transition will not be wholly complete until November 3 , when a President will be chosen by the voters , not by an assassin 's bullet . But with Bobby Kennedy 's decision in the first week of January to stay at least through the election , the essential first stage of the great transition had been successfully accomplished . Ted Sorensen is leaving , Arthur Schlesinger may follow him . and in time other Kennedy men , in the White House and elsewhere in the Administration , may drift away . But it is hard to predict who they will be . Players of the old Washington parlor game ? " Who 's up ? Who 's downT ' ? can find plenty of Ups and very few Downs , Robert McNamara is again firmly established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact need Dean Rusk more than Kennedy needed him , and the two men , both Southerners. have always liked each other . The CIA 's John McCone is very close to the new President , who is fascinated by the intelligence business . McGeorge Bundy has quickly reestablished himself as the indispensable man . Adlai Stevenson is very much up . Cynics suspect that one reason for his conspicuous upness is that Johnson badly needs the support of the liberal intellectuals who dote on Stevenson . The Johnson men , notably Bill I'vloyers , the genial Jack Valenti , Johnson 's longtime assistant Walter Jenkins , and Johnson 's man-of-all-work George Reedy , have melded together surprisingly well with the Kennedy men . Sorensen 's departure will case the space problem in the West Wing of the White House , which has resembled an overpacked sardine can . And the Kennedy men are getting used to the highly individual Johnsonian methods of work . which involve total disregard for all " channels , " a compulsive use of the telephone , and the lavish employment of outside advisers , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the continuity which Johnson sought has been achieved , the nation has awakened from the nightmare of Dallas , and life goes on . A lot of people deserve credit for the great achievement of the great transition , even including the American people . " There 's something in the American people that responds to a crisis , " Johnson remarked to Bill Moyers that afternoon on Air Force One . There is also something in Lyndon Johnson that responds to a crisis , " When he has nothing to do he can be pretty intolerable , " one Kennedy man has said . " But faced with a crisis , he 's magnificent . " There is one person who , even more than Lyndon Johnson , can take credit for the great achievement of the great transition . That is Mrs. John Kennedy , Bill Moyers is still moved when he recalls the words ? " lt 's going to be so long and so lonely " ? which he overheard Jacqueline Kennedy murmur to herself that awful afternoon on the plane . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thinking about herself , " he says . " All through those hours it was as though something inside her said , ' This is not just my husband ; this is the President of the United Slates . ' This country owes her a debt that can not be repaid . In that bad time , when the foul and seamy side of our society lay exposed to the world , she was a symbol of decency and dignity and courage . " And so she was .
