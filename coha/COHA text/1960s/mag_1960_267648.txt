Three hundred high school students marched through the walled city of Suwon last week on their way to attend a Democratic Party political meeting . A swarm of black-uniformed police broke up the paraders . One of those knocked to the ground was a 17-year-old boy . When he was pulled to his feet by a white-gloved cop , blood ran down the boy 's temple and he was crying . <P> The policeman lectured him : " You know you are free to attend Vice President Chang 's meeting , do n't you ? You know we police wo n't try to prevent you ? " The sobbing boy bowed low , and the officer continued : " But you insist on marching along shouting ' We want our freedom ! ' You know that represents a political demonstration against the government , do n't you ? " Bowing repeatedly , the student tried to beg forgiveness , but the cop interrupted him : " Now , we will not allow you to attend the meeting . On account of your bad behavior you must come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself at the feet of a plainclothesman who had been grinning throughout the interrogation . " Do n't let them ! " cried the groveling boy . The plainclothesman watched laughing as the boy was put aboard a police truck . <P> High on a Hill . South Korea was getting set for this week 's national election . The race for the presidency will be a fourth-term walkover for venerable President Syngman Rhee , 84 . Death last month for the second time removed his only opponent ( TIME , Feb. 29 ) . For Vice President , Rhee and his Liberal Party nominated Lee Ki Poong , 63 , an ailing automaton so unpopular that he has not campaigned at all . Four years ago Lee Ki Poong lost by more than 200,000 votes to the Democratic candidate , Roman Catholic John Chang , 60 . <P> In an open and honest election , Chang might well win again . But the police and Rhee 's administration have resources of their own . Chang found himself unable to hire public halls or athletic fields , and bus and taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold meetings . At Suwon , Chang had to hold his rally on a high , bare hilltop while white police Jeeps filled with black-uniformed cops circled the hill and held attendance down to 3,000 . <P> At the southern port city of Yosu , the Democratic Party treasurer was beaten to death with iron bars . In Kwangju , a young Catholic leader was stabbed to death by the local chief of Rhee 's green-shirted " AntiCommunist Youth League . " <P> Leader of Three . But an even more impressive assurance of proper voting is something called " cell voting . " Rhee 's Liberal Party has printed 60 million " training sheets " that are identical with the ballots which will be used this week . <P> In rehearsals , teams of nine voters carefully practice marking the training sheets for Candidates Rhee and Lee Ki Poong . <P> Come election day the nine-man teams will be subdivided into groups of three who will enter the polling place together , with their " leader " in the middle so that he can observe how the other two vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Democratic candidate 's vote was cut from 17,000 to 800.
