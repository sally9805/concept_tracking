Buried on page 15,385 of the U.S. Federal Register last week was a brief announcement in almost incomprehensible officialese . Its well-hidden message : the U.S. Government has ended its 75-day war against all imports from France containing nickel . Washington banned the imports last October ( and promptly impounded more than a dozen shipments ) because France 's giant Le Nickel had been buying large amounts of nickel oxide from Castro 's Cuba . Shipments could resume , said the U.S. , if the French would guarantee that they contained no Cuban nickel . <P> The French government , according to the U.S. announcement , has now agreed to do just that ; it has promised to refuse export licenses to the U.S. to any French company using nickel from Cuba . The U.S. will simply accept the French government guarantee , has already released all the impounded shipments . Le Nickel plans to use the Cuban metal for non-U.S . customers , will supply U.S. buyers from its main mines in New Caledonia . For that purpose , it has signed preliminary agreements with Kaiser Aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step up nickel production and another in the U.S. to sell and distribute it .
