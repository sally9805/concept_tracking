txt New Orleans , Aug. 4 ? Louisiana 's 12,000 registered Republicans are outnumbered 100 to 1 by registered Democrats , but the odds are almost as great that Sen. Barry Goldwater will carry this state for President . It is almost impossible to find anyone in Louisiana except a few Demo -- cratic office ' holders who either openly support ' President Johnson or give him any chance of carrying this state in November ; Moreover , many Democratic office holders ' already - have come out for Goldwater , and it is known that many Others intend to . Louisiana 's new Democratic governor , John J. , who was elected last March , says that " as of . now , Goldwater has this state 's popular and electoral votes going away . " has said repeatedly that he will not " support " Goldwater but may " vote for him . " . A Difficult Cboicb " I might have.to , " says . . He . admits that . he is under tremendous pressure , that it would be , extremely difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons close to his administration are divided between Johnson . and Goldwater . It appears , that the governor wants to be on the-popular side in Louisiana , no matter how the national ejection. goes , bat is reluctant , the , oppose* President This is one of a series of articles probing the political outlook in the to-called solid south states by The Tribune 's writer , Chesly Manly , who is making an on-the-spot survey . Johnson so long as Johnson has a chance to win nationally . He has not decided whether to attend- the ? Democratic national convention in Atlantic City : ? said President Johnson " is even more liberal than the late President Kennedy . " The main reasons for Sen. Goldwater 's popularity in Louisiana , the ? governor said , are his vote against the ' civil rights bill and his promise to return the tidelands to the states . Louisiana is second only to Texas in oil production and its Continuing dispute with the federal government over owner- : ship of the tidelands is a major issue in this state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for Goldwater are John . Hunt , a member of the . Public Service commission ; Sheriff J. Howell Flournoy of Caddo parish Shreveport , and Sargent Pitcher , district attorney of East Baton Rouge parish . Hunt , a nephew of the late Earl Long , former governor , was appointed by the new governor as his successor on the Public Service commission . Flournoy has been sheriff of the state 's third most populous parish for many years and is a leader of the state 's powerful sheriffs ' association . District Atty . Pitcher , whose parish includeS-the state capital , asked Goldwater leaders to put him- in their speakers bureau for a major role in the campaign . Rank and file labor union members are defying the union bosses and bolting the Democratic party in great numbers . David Treen , chairman of the Goldwater organization in metiopolitan New Orleans and candidate for Congress against Rep. Hale Boggs , said one of his wardleaders , , an official of an important labor union , . told him : " I have consulted at least 150 members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go along with the Johnson administration . " No Threat to . Jobs Taxicab drivers all over the country are interested in politics and consider . themselves experts , . bit in New Orleans they are professionals ' and they are militant Goldwaterites . Some are Democratic precinct captains and volunteer organizers for Goldwater . It is widely assumed that the white workers in the lower income groups oppose the new civil rights law because they are afraid they will lose their jobs to Negroes . " That is not true at all , " said one of the more articulate New Orleans taxi drivers . " Most of the Negroes either do n't work or work only part of the time . They prefer to , live on welfare and not be bothered about paying taxes . The Johnson administration 's so-called anti-poverty program calls for a minimum of $3,000 for . every American family . Can you . imagine these people doing any work with a government guarantee of $3,000 a year ? Why should we pay taxes and higher prices for everything we have to buy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only do we pay taxes but the more the government spends on these welfare programs and foreign giveaway programs the more inflation we have and the more it costs us to live , Why ca n't the stupid business men of this country understandwhat is happening to property rights ? How can there be any freedom without property rights ? " Echo of philosopher This humble taxi driver probably never hear of Lord Acton , but he came pretty close ' to the great English philosopher 's dictum that " a people averse to the institution of private property is without the first element of freedom . " Charlton Lyons of Shreveport , Republican state chairman and Goldwater state committee shairman , agreed with the taxi driver 's contention that the main issue is not the civil rights law but freedom . " The liberal press and television pundits who accuse Sen. Goldwater of running a racist campaign to carry the south simply do n't know what 's going , on in this country , " Lyons said . " This is a people 's revolution to restore constitutional government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , about softness toward communism and the trend toward a complete dictatorship in this country . Sen. Goldwater would . be just as strong in the south if there had been no civil rights bill . The delegates at the San Francisco convention , ? including Louisiana 's delegation , were elected independently and they could not be controled . No money or power could have prevented their choice of Sen. Goldwater . He is a genuine grass roots candidate , thrust . up by the people themselves in a time of great peril . " Cause . Attracts Votes Lyons polled about 300,000 votes , almost 40 per cent of the total , ' against in the gubernatorial race last March . He received more votes in Orleans parish alone than any other Republican candidate for governor since reconstruction times has polled in the whole state . Yet he was running against a conservative , segregationist Democrat , who had defeated the late DeLesseps Morrison , a ' liberal , in the Democratic primary . Treen , a young lawyer , got a third of the total vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altho only 46 per cent of the registered voters went to the polls . This year Treen expects a 90 per cent turnout and believes he has a chance to win . Agreeing with Lyons ' analysis , Treen said the main issue is " federal domination the tend toward a police ' state . " " The civil rights bill merely brought this issue home to the people , " Treen said . " They are just begining to realize the . ex : tent of the federal- government 's intervention in education , welfare , housing , local transportation , employment practices , - the conduct of labor ' unions , and the management of business . The people of this state are not race haters . With the exception of a small minority , our people  --  have a sincere concern for the Negroes and want them to advance ? culturally , morally ; and economically . As the Negroes advance , the race problem will disappear . " Treen is a former chairman of the state 's Young Republican federation .
