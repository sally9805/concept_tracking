Among the forces that buffet the U.S. economy , few have preoccupied economists more than the way in which U.S. merchants and manufacturers manage their inventories . Fortnight ago , the errant ways of inventory buyers came under the cold eye of the Joint Congressional Economic Committee . Historically , fluctuations in inventory buying have accentuated swings in the business cycle : in a recovery , businessmen help to create inflation by rapidly building up their inventories , and in a recession they contribute to unemployment by cutting back sharply on their orders . " Investment in inventories , " lamented the Joint Committee 's economic experts , " has been perverse in timing and magnitude . " <P> By the time the committee hearings ended , the Congressmen had heard plenty of conflicting suggestions on what to do . The most drastic proposal was that businessmen be taxed on changes in their inventory levels ; this made scant sense , since every businessman already stands to save money if he can stabilize his inventory . At the other extreme was Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fundamental , " hence any attempt to influence inventory policy directly would be pointless . <P> Missing Motives . All this probing comes at a time when U.S. businessmen seemed to be managing their inventories more smoothly than ever before . Since the economy began to turn up again 17 months ago , inventories have been growing at a far less rapid pace than in previous recoveries . The rate of increase in inventory buying has actually declined every month since last January ; in May , total business inventories rose only $170 million ( to $97.4 billion ) , the smallest increase in nine months . <P> Businessmen are building up their stocks more slowly nowadays because two of the old motives for heavy inventory accumulation are missing : 1 ) there is little need to order from suppliers long in advance , since industry is operating well below capacity ; 2 ) there is less pressure to buy now as a hedge against future price rises because inflation is less of a threat . More and more firms are gearing their inventories more closely to sales by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled one division of American Radiator &; Standard Sanitary Corp . to get along with 10% less inventory . <P> Lost Fat . So far . only a minority of U.S. companies use computers this way . When a majority get around to it , the average size of business inventories ( which has declined from 47 days ' supply on hand six years ago to 44 days ' supply now ) should be cut further . For the economy as a whole , this should be all to the good . Though cautious inventory buying has contributed to the sluggishness of the latest recovery , it may make the next downturn less severe , because businessmen will have less inventory fat to work off before they must start stocking up again .
