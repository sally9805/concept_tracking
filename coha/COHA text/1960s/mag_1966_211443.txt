Puzzled farmers of the plateau country between Paris and Chartres have been scratching their heads and stroking their whiskers at the sight of a 170-m.p.h. vehicle that flies without wings astride a single concrete rail . The streamlined craft that keeps the grands-pres guessing is a half-scale experimental model of France 's wheelless , one-car " aerotrain . " After a year of tests , the French government just gave the go-ahead for construction of a full-sized model that will whisk 84 passengers down a 16-mile test run at speeds of up to 250 m.p.h . <P> Progenitor of the aerotrain is 49-year-old Engineer-Designer Jean Berlin , who in August 1965 , after eight years at the drawing board , received a $600,000 grant from France to build and test his invention on a 31-mile stretch of unused railroad track between the villages of Gometz and Limours . Bertin , who already had the backing of a $1,000,000 company made up of 18 industrial giants such as the French National Railroads , Nord Aviation and Hispano-Suiza , ripped up the standard-gauge track between the two somnolent towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Berlin 's aerotrain resembles a sleek silver bus , rides less than an inch above the rail on a cushion of air produced by two 50-h.p . Renault Gordini engines , propels and brakes itself with a 260-h.p. jet-booster aircraft engine rear-mounted on its roof . <P> The aerotrain , says Bertin modestly , " is intended to complement the car for distances between 70 and 140 miles . " With that in mind , he flew to the U.S. this week . His objective : the formation of a joint Franco-American firm to build a demonstration aerotrain that could cut travel time between New York and Washington to an hour and a half .
