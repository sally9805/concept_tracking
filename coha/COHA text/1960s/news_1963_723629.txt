If the request Is made , it will in effect be a request for state assistance to subsidize the 15-cent subway fare . The amount of aid to be sought has not yet been fixed , but discussions within the administration are proceeding on the basis that the municipal subways should be entitled to as much subsidy as is now given to privately owned suburban commuter railroads . The state and city jointly contribute $13.3 million to these rail lines annually in the form of tax forgiveness . Further Help Considered There has been talk , however , of also asking the state to share a reasonable part of the $110 million that the city pays annually for debt service on capital improvements for the subway system .
