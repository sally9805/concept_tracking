txt Striding purposefully through Pittsburgh 's business center with his bulging briefcase. 70-year-old Ernest Cites represents an increasingly common figure on the American business scene : The retired executive who is using his accumulated skill and experience to carve out a second . successful career as a roving management consultant . When he retired as $50,000-a-year vice president of a major advertising agency , Mr. Giles says . " I did n't want to spend the rest of my life loafing . " So he launched into a succession of assignments that have kept him busy the past five years reorganizing the sales programs , cost-accounting systems and advertising campaigns of a number of local firms . Today , he is one of the . most active members of Associated Senior Executives , a Pittsburgh management counseling service staffed by 50 retlred  --  executives who sell their specialized skills to the small and medium-sized business with a problem . Over the past few years , groups of this kind have sprung up across the country . Cities in which they now exist include Philadelphia . Boston , Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , Miami . Portland . Ore. : Schenectady , N.Y. , and Worcester and Springfield . Mass . " A Growing Trend " " A few more are started each year , " says Norman Sprague , consultant on employment and retirement at the National Council on the Aging , in New York . " It is definitely a growing trend . " William B. Logan &; Associates , Inc. , organized in San Francisco in 1951 , opened a second office in Los Angeles in 1958 , and now plans a third for San Diego . " We want to expand to meet demand , " explains vice president Robert D. Bullock . " We plan to spread out gradually . " James L. ? Guion , 66-year-old president of Industrial Advisors of Western Massachusetts , Inc. , in Springfield , says , " We get letters from all over the country from retired men anxious to start groups like this . I do n't know how many of them eventually succeed , but the inquiries show the interest there is . " No precise record is available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates the past few years have seen the birth of about 20 consulting services staffed exclusively by retired men . " Once people look at an idea like this and see it work , more and more are likely to take it up , " he says . Besides the groups , says Mr. Sprague , there are several hundred retired executives who work as consultants on their own . Modest Profits Although some groups , such as the Senior Council of Cleveland and Experience Inc. , of St. Louis . accept no fees , most operate on a commercial basis . But they 're usually content with modest profits . For example , when Lewis Wald , a retired export executive , set up Industrial Experience . Inc. , in Worcester , Mass. , a year ago , he decided with his five associates that " it should not be a charity-type organization . " The six men put up $500 each , and the venture began paying Its way after three months . At the end of the first year , the dozen men in the enterprise had earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six original partners had recovered their stake of 03,000 plus a modest profit , after taxes , of about $1,000 . Behind the existence of all the groups is the common problem of retired executives who want to remain at least partly active . " You do n't like to feel useless , " explains one man , in Massachusetts . Another , in Pittsburgh , recalls a series of vacations in Florida , California , Mexico and Hawaii after his retirement . " On the cruise ship coming home from Hawaii , I realized that what I really wanted was to do some'work , " he remembers . The counseling groups insist there 's a real need for their services . " Small and mediumsized companies get the services of the kind of top executives they often could not afford to hire in the ordinary way , " claims J. Lewis Palley , the 71-year-old retired manufacturer who founded the Pittsburgh group . " We offer special skills for special services , " says Walter D. Fuller , former chairman of Curtis Publishing Co. , a former president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuller Associates , a group he set up in Philadelphia four years ago . William B. Logan . the management con- sultant who founded the San Francisco consuiting firm bearing his name , claims the service " hits at the root problem of American small business  --  inadequate management by the small businessman who has skill in only one phase of management and tends to ignore or underrate the rest . " Assignments ' do not come exclusively from small companies , however , and they vary greatly in scope . ? In Philadelphia , a major oil corporation having difficulties with the development of a petroleum derivative , engaged the services of an 80-year-old retired scientist who has apecialized in a rare branch of chemistry . " He spent two days in the laboratory , solved the difficulty , and saved the corporation at least $t million , " reports Mr. Fuller . At another extreme , several retired executives in Pittsburgh are currently exploring on behalf of two inventors the commercial possibilities of a , $10 " piano silencer. " a device designed to hush the tinkle-and-bonk produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine : A small tool and die company wants help in marketing a safety device that encloses the whirring blades of a motor-driven lawn-mower : a textile factory wants to reorganize its system of production controls ; a packaging company wants help in ironing out its staff problems ; a small manufacturer wants help in planning a sales campaign for a $70 ornamental gas light intended for suburban lawns ; the relatives of an 80-year-old foundry owner want to know whether the business will be worth preserving and , if it is , how it can be improved . Assignments vary from the one-day job to a " packaged " consulting service that can be bought for a year at a time . Mi . Palley 's Pittsburgh group charges a minimum of $120 a day , but not more than $7,500 for a year 's consultation . Industrial Advisors of Western Massachussets has a minimum of $100 a day . In both groups , the men who do the work take three-quarters of the fee , while the rest goes to pay the expenses of the organization .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
