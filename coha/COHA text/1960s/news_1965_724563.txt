txt Mayor ' Wagner 's forces in the Bronx opened a new ! political attack yesterday on Charles A. Buckley , who reH Isponded with a bitter attack on Senate Majority Leader ! ' Joseph Zaretzki , who in turn : replied that he did not want to fight anybody . Joseph C. Di Carlo , chair- , man of the Mayor 's Bronx Democratic reorganization coin-. mittee and city Commissioner of Licenses. attacked Mr. Buckley in a statement issued with . the approval of the Mayor . Mr. Di Carlo declared that ? " any attempts to buy unity in : Albany or within the state Democratic organization by nourishing the Buckley hunger : for patronage will be a falsely bought unity . " Split by Albany Fight The recent intra - party . struggle for the leadership of : the Legislature has left the . state 's Democrats badly split .. In that contest . a coalition of Republicans and Democrats , loyal to the Mayor succeeded : in electing Anthony J. Travia : Speaker of the Assembly and Mr. Zaretzki Temporary Presi- dent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckley as say- , ing , " Let them give me the jobs . I 'll give them the right men , " Mr. Di Carlo said : " Phis is precisely what Mayor Wagner . Senator Zaretzki and , Assembly Speaker Travia have : been fighting. , and what Senator Kennedy was speaking out against in his letter to the two : legislative leaders . " In that letter . sent last week , Mr. Kennedy warned against handing out jobs as patronage . " It is obvious , " Mr. Di Carlo said . - . Mr. Buckley did not read Senator Kennedy 's letter carefully , or at all . If he did . he would know what everyone in responsible leadership has been advocatin is precisely the opposite of what Mr. Buckley wants : old-time patronage tactics only designed to help him and not the people . " At a moment when unity and a constructive , productive legislative program should . be the objective of all concerned , Mr. Buckley is still issuing war communiqu ? s . " Reached by telephone at his home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement had the Mayor 's approval , let Wagner come up to the Bronx and I 'll show him who 's boss . Di Carlo 's nothing without the Mayor . And as for the Mayor , I 'll debate him on television and I 'll pay the bill . " Going ' All Ont ' Mr. Di Carlo said his forces , independent of the reform Democratic drive , were going - all out " against the Buckley organization in the Democratic primaries in September . Mr. Buckley , who has been fighting with the Mayor since 1961 , opposed the election of Mr. Zaretzki and Mr. Travia to their legislative leadership posts . There has been recent speculation that Mr. Buckley would retire soon , but he said yesterday : " I never run away from a fight . " Mr. Di Carlo said he was considering opposing the Buckley candidate for Bronx Borough President . Using such words as " bum ? " " punk " and " creep , " Mr. Buckley retorted : " Let him try to go for Borough President . We 'd just love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Di Carlo replied last night : " He would be funny if he were n't so sad . " Mr. Buckley , asked if he had approached Mr. Zaretzki for patronage , shouted : " Zaretzki ! The Republicans put him- in . Barnum and Bailey can use him when he 's finished in Albany . Look at that Zar1etzki . When he was practically out of the thing , he called me up to plead for my support so he could stay on to collect his pension . . " I never called him . He called me . He wanted to tell me how much he loved me . Poor Joe*was on the ropes and Rockefeller came along and pulled him off . They ought to throw a net over Zaretzki . " This was the same caustic comment Mr. Buckley aimed at Jonathan B. Bingham in their primary fight last June , when Mr. Bingham defeated the Congressman for the Democratic nomination in the 25d District The recent victory of Mayor Wagner 's men in the Legislature was another sharp . blow to the power and patronage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckley , the tough 74-year-old Bronx leader , continuing his attack on the Wagner forces , said : " I never got any jobs out of Albany . And I was n't asking for any . All I merely was saying was that if there Is a scarcity of men , we have a lot of qualified men right here in the Bronx . " Mr. Zaretzki . In a telephone interview from his Manhattan ; apartment ; refused to comment ; on Mr. Buckley 's remarks . " I 'm ; through battling politicians , " ' he said . . Asked if he still thought Sen-II ator Kennedy was trying to ' " take over the Legislature oC New York , " Mr. Zaretski paused I fora moment and then said : positive that Kennedy will make one of the best Unit-I ed . States Senators we ever had .. There 's no question about it in , my mind . I shall be glad tog cooperate fully with him on any , state or Federal matter . " - Asked if he thought his re-I marks about Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he " never had anything against Mr. Kennedy . " Kennedy ' Surprised ' Finally , Mr. Kennedy , in a telephone interview from his home in Virginia , said he was " rather surprised at the reaction of my suggestion that those assisting the Legislature be selected on merit . " He added : " I 've made my position clear on this thing over a long period of time . " The attack by the Wagner ' forces on Mr. Buckley was considered significant by a number of Democratic leaders , particularly because it came in the ' midst of the power struggle for ' the party 's state leadership . Several Democrats , including friends of the Mayor , believe Mr. Wagner 's only chance to obtain the Democratic nomination for Governor next year , if he should want it . would he in a statewide primary . This is because his political rivals apparently would control a majority of the conventioa delegates . They point out , however , that if Mr. Wagner were to topple Mr. Buckley and gain control of the Bronx organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , or least his own pick , as Democratic candidate for Governor .
