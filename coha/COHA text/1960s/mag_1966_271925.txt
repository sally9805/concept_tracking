The small press alcoves on the south side of the courtroom were jammed . Reporters who could not find space lined the corridor beyond and scribbled notes as best they could . Court secretaries who normally stick to their typewriters peered through the brass latticework at the cause of all the hubbub : Dr. Sam Sheppard , 42 . With the unwitting help of the press , Sheppard had finally managed to have his case heard by the Supreme Court of the U.S. <P> A decade ago , the Supreme Court had declined to review Sheppard 's life sentence for the murder of his wife . Then , in 1964 , he was released from jail by U.S. District Judge Carl Weinman , who did not rule on the doctor 's guilt or innocence but ordered a new trial . The press , he said , had kept the defense from getting an unbiased verdict . <P> " If ever there was a trial by newspaper , " wrote Weinman in his decision , " this is a perfect example . And the most insidious violator was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon itself the role of accuser , judge and jury . The journalistic value of its front-page editorials , the screaming slanted headlines and the nonobjective reporting was nil , but they were calculated to inflame and prejudice the public . The Cleveland Press showed no respect for its responsibilities . " <P> Escaping the Media . In a split decision , the Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati reversed Weinman , but Sheppard stayed on bail . He listened intently last week as his attorney , F. Lee Bailey , recalled once more the " circus publicity " of the trial . The reason for such banner headlines as WHY IS N'T SAM SHEPPARD IN JAIL ? ; QUIT STALLING , BRING HIM IN ; Bailey contended , was that Cleveland Press Editor Louis Seltzer ( who recently retired ) thought that only his paper could prevent a cover-up of the murder . Once the trial began , Bailey argued , Seltzer pressed for a conviction so that his paper would be protected against libel suits . <P> Joining the case as a friend of the court , Bernard A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Edward Blythin should have removed the trial to a " remote county " of Ohio . In view of the " massive publicity , " Berkman went on to say , the defendant had a right to choose his own place of trial . In that circumstance , said Chief Justice Earl Warren , " where we have so many news media-television , radio , newspapers-no trial would be had in a big city if the defendant wanted to go some place else . " <P> In an effort to prove that court officials as well as newspapers were prejudiced , Bailey told how Judge Blythin had confided to Hearst Columnist Dorothy Kilgallen in a pretrial interview that Sheppard was " guilty as hell . ' ' Ohio Attorney General William Saxbe contended that Kilgallen 's affidavit had never been sworn . Because Kilgallen as well as Judge Blythin have since died , Saxbe maintained that the statement could not be rebutted and was inadmissible . Bailey retorted that an assistant attorney general of Ohio had accompanied him when he talked with Kilgallen , and they agreed that her statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminence and integrity . " This presented the court with the odd situation in which the attorney general 's office agreed to the taking of a statement , then objected to it later in court .
