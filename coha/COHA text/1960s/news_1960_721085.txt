txt President Eisenhower began his trip to Latin America yesterday where it is going to end ? in Puerto Rico . There , as they say wherever Spanish is spoken , he is en su , casa ? in his own home . His problem , as he recognized in his predeparture television address on Sunday evening , is to make everyone realize that the phrase is not literal . Puerto Rico does not " belong " to the United States ; it is freely associated . It is interesting and significant that at the beginning of his journey President Eisenhower should have to face a problem of transcendent importance in United States relations with Latin America . This can be labeled as a difference in the way we see things . It is perfectly true that Puerto Ricans have themselves chosen the commonwealth status and that they are equally free to choose independence or to ask for statehood if they want it . As a commonwealth they have a considerable degree of autonomy  --  just as much as they want . This is the reality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One can not be precise , but certainly a great segment of . opinion all over the hemisphere rates Puerto Rico as the equivalent of a colony of the United States and Puerto Ricans as North American stooges . It will not be overlooked that President Eisenhower spent his first night and will spend the last nights of his trip on a United States Air Force base on Puerto Rican soil . He is only too patently en szt casa . The problem in this case is essentially one of public relations . The truth about Puerto Rico is a justifiable source of pride to all Nofth Americans . President Eisenhower was not being simply diplomatic yesterday on arriving in San Juan , when he said : " We are happy that Puerto Rico is a proud , free , self-governing commonwealth , joined to the United States of America by her own choice . " Governor Munoz Marin in his reply was not being hypocritical or demagogic when he said : " We also know that if Puerto Rico had desired to separate itself from the United States , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rican people in that respect . " Both men were stating straightforward facts . Both will be believed by everyone who knows the facts or who has no preconceived notions or innate suspicions of the United States . But both will be scoffed at and disbelieved by many in the four countries that President Eisenhower is going to visit in South America  --  Brazil , Argentina , Chile and Uruguay . The problem , therefore , is a double one  --  to have a good policy but also to have that policy understood and appreciated in Latin America . A traveling statesman , like a traveling salesman , has a product to sell . Mr. Eisenhower will certainly get a lot of advice on how to better the product he is selling  --  the policy of the United States toward Latin America  --  and he must seek to overcome a major source of the sales resistance he will find , which is based on disbelief and misunderstanding of what is good in American policy .                 @ @ @ @
