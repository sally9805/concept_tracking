Deep in the interior of Brazil 's state of Bahia last week , the population of the town of Bom Jesus de Lapa was swollen from its usual 4,500 to a teeming 500,000 - sweltering , brawling , praying through fetid nights and sun-baked days . Beggars chanted their off-key songs and picked their scabs till the blood ran , priests dashed about performing ten-minute marriages and baptisms , police struggled unsuccessfully to keep the number of arrests in some ratio to the number of crimes , and hucksters had a field day . A man could buy a wedding ring or an aphrodisiac at the same stand ; statuettes of Christ and the Virgin competed with jaguar skins , dice tables and 275 prostitutes . <P> The summer-long festival of the Good Jesus was drawing to a close . And with more than $40,000 in the coffers of the local church , it was clearly the most successful in the festival 's 250 years . <P> Playboy to Hermit . The Festival of the Good Jesus began with a rich young Lisbon playboy , born in 1657 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 22-just ahead of an irate husband . Francisco de Mendonga Mar settled in the bustling port city of Bahia and carried on in the manner to which he was accustomed until a row with the governor landed him in jail . When prisoners were released to help defend the city against Dutch pirates , Francisco dodged conscription by dressing as a monk and carrying a small crucifix . He slipped out of the beleaguered city and started walking inland . <P> For two parched and half-starved months he walked , and somewhere along the line he found his faith . One day he came to a high sugarloaf mountain honeycombed with passages and caves . In one of these caves Francisco began to live the life of a hermit . Within a few years , however , the discovery of gold brought prospectors into the area , and word soon spread of the miracles performed by the young holy man " with long blond hair to his waist and jet-black eyes . " After a while all Brazil seemed to be beating a path to Francisco 's door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Good Jesus is constantly being filled by home-carved ex - votes ( tokens commemorating miraculous cures and deliverances ) as well as crutches , canes and hanks of hair ( beards grown to secure a special blessing ) . As fast as they accumulate , priests remove these offerings to a nearby grotto , which is a kind of museum of so-called miracles . <P> The five priests assigned to the shrine do their best to discourage superstition , but without much success . Despite the fact that the church takes no official notice of the " miracles , " Brazilian peasants still claim divine intervention almost daily during the festival . One day last week word came that a man had dropped dead in the grotto , and one of the priests hurried inside . The corpse of a hulking farmer lay on his face before the shrine , his dry-eyed wife standing over him . " Serves him right , " she said to the padre . " He never was any good-always fighting and abusing me and the kids . I told him before we left home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus . " Suddenly a cry rose in the crowd : " A miracle ! Evil struck down by a miracle ! "
