THE SLAVE ( 311 pp. ) - Isaac Bashevis Singer-Farrar , Straus &Cudahy($4.95}.; <P> <P> Novelists who persist , in a secular age , in chronicling man 's war and peace with God are quite likely to be artists , or at least men whose obsessions speak with the force of art ; the hacks are more likely to follow the fashion , which is to whimper at Meaninglessness . The late Nikos Kazantzakis ( The Last Temptation of Christ ; St. Francis ) was such a God-obsessed artist , and so , in a slighter and less intense way , is Isaac Singer , 57 , a Pole ( now a U.S. citizen ) who lives in Manhattan and writes in Yiddish . His subjects are usually lowly Polish Jews , important only to themselves , God and the Devil ; the mark of his skill is that he makes them - and makes God and the Devil-important to secular readers . <P> Tolerance &; Temptation . The title figure of The Slave is a 17th century Polish Jew named Jacob . Marauding Cossacks have swept through his village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to be sold as slaves . At the book 's outset , Jacob has spent four years as a slave of the Gazdas , a Polish mountaineer people who practice a debased kind of paganism lightly colored by Christianity . Although a Talmudic scholar and a skilled woodcarver . Jacob has learned to tend the Gazdas ' cattle , and he is tolerated because he is good at it . But he observes his dietary laws , refuses to fornicate with village sluts , and speaks of God as if God existed . For these eccentricities he is treated with contempt that threatens always to become murderous hatred . <P> Jacob 's sore temptation is Wanda , the daughter of his master . She is intelligent and well formed . But by both Jewish and Christian custom of the times , marriage of Jew and Gentile must be punished at least by ostracism , probably by death . Jacob is ransomed and eventually wanders to Lublin , but finds no comfort among the city 's Jews , who seem to have forgotten the Cossack massacres . They have grown fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk and sables . They were so heavy they wheezed ; their eyes shone greedily . They spoke an only half comprehensible language of innuendoes , winks and whispered asides . ' ' Sickened by man and unable to love God , Jacob returns secretly to the Gazda village to find Wanda . They make their way to a Jewish squatters ' community , where Wanda escapes detection as a Gentile by pretending to be mute , and Jacob , the scholar , shortly becomes a community leader . <P> Spreading Graves . By this point the reader sees that Novelist Singer , beginning his account amid cow dung and human bestiality , has subtly led his tale away from the kind of reality that is composed of what is probable and what is worldly . As the novel continues , it is legend . Wanda dies in childbirth , and her screams reveal her as a Gentile . Jacob is arrested , but escapes and travels with his infant son to Palestine . In his old age , Jacob returns to the village where Wanda died . He finds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by spreading graves ; the dead have accepted the convert .
