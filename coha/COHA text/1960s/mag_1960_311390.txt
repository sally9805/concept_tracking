Most modern astronomers agree that the sun and its planets condensed from a single great cloud of gas . But they disagree , sometimes sharply , about the details of how it happened-and none of the theories have ever quite fitted together to give a satisfying solution to one of science 's most baffling puzzles . Now , from Professor Hannes Alfven of Stockholm 's Royal Institute of Technology , comes a promising explanation . To explain the solar system , Alfven says , other scientists have used plain old hydrodynamics ( the behavior of fluids , including gases ) ; if magnetohydrodynamics ( the behavior of ionized gases in a magnetic field ) is used instead , many things become clear . <P> Alfven points out in Britain 's New Scientist that ordinary hydrodynamics rules only in tiny crannies of the universe , such as the earth 's ocean and the lower levels of the earth 's atmosphere . The great bulk of the universe , including the stars and most of the matter between them , is made of ionized gases whose atoms have electric charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth 's familiar water and air , most of whose atoms are electrically neutral , ionized gases are influenced by the magnetic fields that pervade space . <P> Three Parts . When the sun formed in the heart of a hot and ionized cosmic cloud , Alfven believes , the sun 's powerful magnetic field fended off the distant , electrically charged parts of the cloud . Gradually the cloud cooled , and some of its ionized atoms combined with electrons , making the atoms electrically neutral and permitting them to fall toward the sun . After they had fallen a few hundred million miles , they acquired tremendous speed , collided with the thin gas that surrounds the sun , were ionized again by the energy of collision , and then were stopped in their tracks by the sun 's magnetic field . Easily ionized chemical elements were stopped well away from the sun ; some that were harder to ionize got close to the sun before they were halted . <P> One fraction of cloud , mostly made up of hard-to-ionize elements , stopped near the orbit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it cooled off , some of its material condensed into dust . The dust grains grew bigger and bigger by attracting each other , and they finally coalesced to form three planets : Mercury , Venus and Earth . Another fraction of the cosmic cloud stopped farther away from the sun , forming Mars and the moon . Since these two zones of planet formation overlapped , the earth was able to capture the moon as its satellite . The big outer planets , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune , were formed from a third fraction of the cosmic cloud , whose chemical composition allowed it to be ionized and stopped at a very great distance from the sun . <P> Third Planet . Alfven believes that his theory gives nearly every star a retinue of planets . " In fact , " he says , " if we consider a star with the same mass as the sun , we should expect that the third planet from it moves at about the same distance as the earth from the sun , and has a constitution which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory : the third planet away from stars like the sun has the conditions most likely to sustain life .
