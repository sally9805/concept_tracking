THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AF TER decades of plastering the in- terior of Grand Central Terminal with advertisement upon advertisement , the men in charge of decorating the once stately chamber called the Upper Level have come up with an idea so breathtaking in its novelty , simplicity , and splendor that it makes us optimistic about the whole world 's prospects in this dawning year : They have allocated a large hunk of gallery space to a brace of austere signboards announcing the arrivals and departures of trains . THE American Broadcasting Com-pany 's annual report on world conditions over the past year scored two firsts on its 1966 show . It was the first time the program had been telecast in color , and it was the first time the network 's commentators had appeared in black tie . THE idea that another of the television stations in the New York area had of showing uninterruptedly for three hours on Christmas Eve a log burning in a fireplace struck us as a good one , but this was before , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning log was depressing  --  more depressing , somehow , than the banalities and sales pitches of the other channels , which it was meant to save us from . For here television had taken another , and drastic , step ; from an intruder into our living rooms it had become an unnatural extension of them . It was pointing to a future in which the television screen would be the only view available from small , machined apartments , a view of a gone world , and we visualized lovers holding hands in front of a televised moon or old ladies watching a staged procession of neighbors walk h ) their television window . As , throughout the evening , we threw occasional glances at the un changing log of Channel 11 , we felt we might he catching a glimpse of a future electronic hell where the worm dieth not and the fire consumeth not . Storm King CONSOLIDATED EDISON 'S plan to poke a hole in Storm King Mountain for the purpose of inserting a power plant is being fought h ' , conservationists and others before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hooks , old and only moderatc1 ) old , that dealt with the area , we waked until a fairly warm day came along , and then we got into our car and drove up to take a look at Storm King . Beyond West Point , we followed the old Storm King Highway ( Route 218 ) along the west bank of the Hudson toward Cornwall , the proposed site of the plant . The highway , a narrow , two-lane road , twisted perilously around the eastern perimeter of Storm King , winding along halfway up the side of the mountain ; a low stone wall stood between us and the river , hundreds of feet below . " Falling Rock Zone " signs appeared at all too frequent intervals , and to us the stone cliffs overhead seemed likely to give way at any moment . We stopped at an overlook  --  a wide place in the road  --  and got out of our car to peer into the abyss . One of our source books had told us what we 'd see : " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiordlike waterway , these mountains at the north portal of the Highlands are its loftiest , " wrote Paul Wilstach in " Hudson River Landings " 119331 . " No anticlimax here . On the west side Crow 's Nest rises one thousand three hundred and ninety-six and Storm King one thousand three hundred and forty feet . Opposite them , Bull Hill rises one thousand four hun drill and twenty-five and Breakneck Ridge one thousand six hundred and thirty-five feet . The green and grey scarps draw themselves up to their highest like the receding folds of doors opened to let the ships pass , but in their towering presence no ship passes through these portals that does not , by comparison with them , seem somewhat puny . " Wilstach was right . The view was awesome , and , far below , a puny tug and barge were passing through the portals , leaving a long white wake . We got back in the car and went down into Cornwall , a town that sits in the lee of Storm King on the north . We drove through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santoro 's Restaurant , Toon-Powers School of Ballet , Storm King Movie Theatre ) and turned down River Road , making a steep descent past small , neat white houses , and then some poor-looking ones , toward the Hudson . On the riverbank , we turned south on Shore Road and drove alongside a single rail-road track , heading toward the base of the mountain and the plant site . The river was broad ; Newburgh Bay stretched away to the north , and we could see gleaming oil tanks and a big bridge in the distance . Here , according to our reading , Henry Hud-son had anchored on his re-turn trip downriver in 1609 , having reached what is now Albany and the disappointing conclusion that the waterway , despite its saltiness and its tides , did not lead to the Western sea . " This night , at ten of the clocke , our boat returned in a showre of rainy from sounding the river ; and found it to bee at an endl fur ? shipping to goe in , " said the September 22nd entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fuct . A week later , the Half Moon ap-proached Storm King . " Turned down to the edge of the mountains , or the ? northernmost of the mountains , and anchored because the high lands hath many points , and a narrow channel , and bath many eddie winds , " said the entry for September 29th . " So we rode quietly all night . " We drove for a quarter of a mile or so , passing an abandoned three-story factory of old brick , some low buildings standing in tall grass and weeds , and a few houses , and came to a marina . " Cornwall Yacht Club . Members Only , " said a sign . There was a small white clubhouse , and , beyond it , an informal arrangement of docks . Only one boat was tied up . On the shore , twenty or thirty large powerboats were resting on cradles , shrouded under orange , brown , green , gray , and ye-low tarpaulins . We parked our car and got out . The whine of a power tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a man and a young girl were making repairs on the stern . Nobody else was around . A weathered barge was grounded in the river at the southern end of the marina , its hull attached to piles , forming a a breakwater , and a heavy cable stretched from its bow to the shore . Beyond the barge , past a stand of trees on the shore , the single railroad track curved away around the base of Storm King . The great hulk of the mountain soared above us , pale brownish-purple with hare trees and underbrush , which in places , high up , turned to rock , crinkled like elephant hide ; at the peak , more than a thousand feet over our head , the sun was a light-colored disc in haze , almost touching the tiny , fuzzy treetops . Downrivcr , a graceful blue slope of mountain on the far shore intersected the dark rise of Storm King . In this direction , and to the east , we thought , the river and the mountains looked pretty much the way Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track and two rows of telephone poles flanking it ; the highways were obscured , and only a few structures were visible , on the far bank . We walked down among the boats . A rat darted out from under one of the shiny hulls and disappeared beneath some timbers . Hudson would have been puzzled by some of the refuse scattered around the shore  --  a can of antifreeze , a jar of red peppers , some blue Kleenexes , an aluminum pie plate , a plastic container labelled " Valmycin Tablets ( Neomycin sulfate 60 mg. equivalent to 40 mg . Neomycin base ... ) , " a strip of stick-on shelf paper decorated with roses , an empty bottle labelled " Vista Sparkling Beverages . " The water made a brushing sound as it lapped against rocks and tree stumps . It must have been along here , we decided , that an energetic author-artist named Benson J. Lossing had paddled more than a century ago , making sketches and notes for his book " The Hudson , from the Wilderness to the Sea , Illustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Author , and a frontispiece on Steel , " which was published by Virtue &; Yorston in 1866 . " I went in a skiff around to the shaded nooks of the Western shore below the Storm King and viewed the mountains in all their grandeur from their bases , " he wrote . " The Storm King , seen from the middle- of the river abreast its eastern centre , is almost semicircular in form , and gave to the minds of the utilitarian Dutch skippers who navigated the Hudson early the idea of a huge lump of butter , and they named it Botcr Berg , or Butter Hill . It had that name until recently , when Mr. Willis Nathaniel Parker Willis , known as the Dude Poet of the Hudson successfully appealed to the good taste of the public by giving it the more appropriate and poetic title of Storm King . " In the preface to his book , Lossing apologizes for his engravings . " It is impossible to give in pictures so necessarily small as are those which illustrate this volume an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hudson River . " But the engravings , which are clean and clear , give a splendid idea . Six of them are of the Storm King area , and it is dotted in each with sailboats , rowboats , and steamboats . Lossing seems to have been a cheerful explorer as well as a vigorous one . " On a cool , bright morning in August , I climbed to the bald summit of the Storm King , accompanied by a few friends , " he wrote . " We procured a competent guide at Cornwall landing , and ascended the nearest and steepest part , where a path was to he found . It was a rough and difficult one , made originally by those who gathered hoop-poles material for hoops upon the mountains . It was gullied in some places , and filled with stones in others , because it serves for the bed of a mounmin torrent during showers and storms . Nearly half-way- up to the first summit we found a spring of delicious water , where we rested .... We reached the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half .... At last the greatest altitude was reached , after making our way another mile over rocky ledges , and through gorges filled with shrub-oaks , and other bushes . There a glorious picture filled us with exquisite pleasure . I 'Ve felt amply rewarded for all our toil . The sky was cloudless , and the atmosphere perfectly clear .... Looking northward , the river was seen in its slightly winding course to Crom Elbow , twenty-six miles distant , with the intermediate villages along its banks .... Our view included portions of seven counties in the State of New York , and of three in Connecticut , with numerous inland villages . In the extreme ... northeast ... were the hills of western Massachusetts and Connecticut . Almost at our feet lay Cornwall .... The passing trains upon the Hudson River Railway , and large steamers , and more than forty sail of vessels of all sizes , seen upon the river at the same time , appeared almost like toys for children . Yet small as they seemed , and diminutive as we must have appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of our party , brought responses in kind from the windows of the railway cars . " We strolled south along the railroad track , and though we kept an eye out for the old path of the hoop-pole gatherers , we saw no sign of it . We walked sometimes on the ties , sometimes on a gravelly roadbed that ran alongside the track , and sometimes on the edge of the riverbank . There was a smell of wet leaves ; the trees and shrubs on the slope above us were bare , but the ground was thick with tan and orange leaves , and tangle . No boa.ts at all were visible on the river , but we saw a freight train come up the east hank . There must have been over a hundred cars  --  we lost count at sixty . The head of the train disappeared into a short tunnel , then came out at the other end , giving us two trains to look at  --  one vanishing and one emerging . At last , the entire train had rumbled out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . As we walked along , the next sound we noticed was the splatter and gulp of a very small stream coming down the hillside and gliding over gleaming rocks ; ferns and mosses were growing among the wet walls of stone . Then we heard a dog hark , across the river . The railroad track now led under jagged vertical black cliffs ; looking up , we saw  --  two hundred feet above the branches of trees sticking out against the sky . We stood for a while at the outermost reach of the mountain , where  --  except for the narrow cut that had been blasted away to allow for the track  --  the cliffs seemed to dive almost straight down into the Hudson . There was nothing moving except the slow , ruffled surface of the river , and no sound except the gentle slap of water on the rocks , but there was the presence of the mountain , huge , silent , serene . A few yards beyond , the base of Storm King curved west again , turning inland , and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Point . From the shiny river , the bluffs and hills and mountains rose , their silhouettes emerging from one another , each shape a distinct and different hue  --  blue-grays and lavenders  --  and , as the distance increased , each paler than the last . The farthest hills were dusty blue , almost as light as the sky . ? WE have it from the mouth of a proud local six-year-old girl that she appeared in her school 's seasonal pageant as " a singing Christmas present . " The Corner OVER the past forty years  --  give or take a few  --  there have been many corners in Harlem where people have gathered for one reason or another , but the most popular by far has been the southwest corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue , a rallying place all day Saturday for disaffected Negroes who live around there , On The Corner , as it is known locally , there is nearly always someone orating , preaching , exhorting , though the face of the speaker may change from time to time . And people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond aloud to what they hear . When one listener leaves , the gap is immediately filled by another . But if the crowd shifts , it does not change . Nor does the theme . In one form or another , it has nearly always been black nationalism  --  from the West Indian brand of Marcus Garvey and his followers to the more militant brand of Charles ( Morriss ) 37X Kenyatta , The Corner 's chief present-day occupant , who is the spokesman for Harlem 's Mau Mau Society . A street-corner speaker 's identity can usually he determined by the articles with which he surrounds himself . The standard equipment for any Harlem street-corner speaker is a stepladder or a soapbox ( or , on very special occasions , a wooden platform ) , when he is n't standing on a car hood ; a flag or two ( the Garveyites ' was red , black , and green , and Kenyatta 's is orange , black , and green ) ; an assortment of placards ; and a collection plate , bucket , or hat . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a collection , on the ground that ( in Kenyatta 's words ) " money makes a man sing a different song . " In the old days , Garvey , before he was sent to prison ( and later deported to Jamaica ) , established a spiritual legacy . The Amsb.rtiam News , Harlem 's durable weekly newspaper , commented in 1927 , " In a world where black is despised , he taught them that black is beautiful . He taught them to admire and praise black things and black people .... They rallied to him because he heard and responded to the heartbeat of his race . " In Garvey 's absence , his followers extended both his word and his myth . The West Indians , who had come from societies in which class distinctions were more important than color , were hostile to the American Negroes , because  --  or so it is sometimes said  --  they could not understand how a black man allowed hatred based on color to keep him down . In exhorting their American listeners ti abandon their docility , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot like the West Indian Ras the Exhorter ( later Ras the Destro ) Cr ) in Ralph Ellison 's " Invisible Man . " At one such rally , Ras could he heard for miles around shouting , " Wit gine chase ' em out ! Out ! " To which a heart ) voice from the crowd responded , " Tell ' em about it , Ras , ma lin ! " One day recently , as we were waiting on The Corner , with a number of other people , for Kenyatta to appear , we got into conversation with a slender West Indian in his sixties named James Thornhill , who used to speak on The Corner in the twenties and thirties but now mostly listens . We asked him how long he had lived in Harlem . Thornhill took us by the arm and walked with us a few steps away from the gathering . He told us that as a youth he had been a follower and bodyguard of Garvey 's . ( Nearly everyone who speaks on The Corner has a small retinue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . ) " I left the Virgin Islands to become a seaman , " Thornhill went on , in a voice that still had a slight lilt in it . " I travelled in Asia , Africa , the Caribbean , and Central and South America , and I learned four or five languages . When I came to Harlem , in the twenties , black people did n't even walk these streets . In 1932 and 1933 , along with Adam Powell , Jr. , and other members of the Harlem Labor Union , I helped put Negro workers in all these stores . " He waved a hand in the direction of the clothing and furniture stores on 125th Street . " The black people themselves have got to develop their own community , " he continued . " I have said time and time again from this corner that we can not depend on other communities to do what we must do for ourselves . " The campaign that Thornhill referred to had other advocates  --  Ira Kemp , Arthur Reid , and James R. Lawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and off for twenty-five years . Lawson now works a few yards away from The Corner , at the Haryou-Act headquarters , in the Hotel Theresa . On another Saturday when we were on The Corner , and Kenyatta , at the end of two and a half hours of speechmaking , had stopped for a coffee break , we took the opportunity to drop in on Lawson in the Theresa . A tall , heavyset man whose manner seemed dour at first , Lawson brightened when he talked about The Corner , which he called Harlem 's Africa Square . He told us that during the Italian-Ethiopian conflict he was among the speakers who urged Harlem residents not to pa-tronize the Italian businessmen there . " Do n't even buy ice from them ! " he would tell his listeners . He went on , to us , " No black man could , in good conscience , go into most Ital-ian bars in Harlem . Mussolini 's picture hung over almost every Italian cash register up there . At that time , black people owned only two bars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people owned thirty-five . My voice was heard from this corner around the world . " For his support of Ethiopia , Lawson received the Order of the Star of Ethiopia and was made a Knight Commander of the Grand Caudern by Emperor Haile Selassie . In the last thirty years , other speakers , on other topics , have sometimes used 125th Street and Seventh Avenue as their forum , Lawson continued . Negro Communists , including Benjamin Davis , at one time a New York City Councilman , were among them , but they arc not recalled in the neighborhood with the same friendly nostalgia as are Alex Prempeh , Lewis Michaux , the late Carlos Conk , Soufi Abdul Hamid , Mother Bessie Phillips , Nana Oba , and an elusive man named Eddie Davis , widely known as Pork Chop , who all spoke on The Corner . Lawson said that these people 's theme , and his , had not really changed but that it had often been necessary to change tactics . Many boycotts and picket lines had had their genesis on The Corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the orators were pro-Japanese . " It was the whole color thing , " he explained . Probably the most dynamic speaker to come to 125th Street and Seventh Avenue in recent times was Malcolm X. One of the biggest rallies on The Corner was one that he held in 1960 , when his purpose was to unify Negro leaders . According to his biographer Louis Lomax , fifteen " outstanding Negro leaders " were invited to participate but none came . Thirteen black-nationalist groups took part , though , and for five hours thousands of people stood listening to various speakers , including Malcolm X himself , who them represented Elijah Muhammad 's Black Muslims . " They call us racial extremists , " Malcolm said that day . " They call Jomo Kenyatta President of Kenya also a racial extremist , and Tom Mboya a moderate . It is only the white man 's fear of men like Kenyatta that makes him listen to men like Mboya . If it were not for the extremists , the white man would ignore the moderates . To be called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is crying for freedom , is to receive the kiss of death as spokesmen or leaders of the masses ... for the masses are ready to burst the shackles of slavery whether the ' moderates ' will stand up or not . We have many black leaders who are unafraid , especially when they know the black masses stand behind them . Many of them are qualified to THE NEW YORKER represent us ... in this United States government . if we are given one-hundred-percent citizenship and the opportunity for firstclass participation .. . or else we can get behind these same leaders in setting up an independent government of our own . " Charles 37X Kenyatta told us one Saturday , before he began his speaking stint , that he and Malcolm X had been close friends since 1961 , when they met in Detroit . Kenyatta , a handsome thirty-fiveyear-old North Carolinian with a neatly trimmed goatee , said he had wanted to be a lawyer but fate had been against him . " Malcolm made me realize what I could do , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces opposed to revolution , but I decided that if Malcolm could , I could . " Kenyatta explained that people interested in forming a program often meet with him on Sunday nights in the Old Garvey Hall , on Eighth Avenue near 128th Street . On The Corner , Kenyatta , who stands on the top step of a ladder , is a fiery speaker and punctuates his words with a machete , slicing and jabbing the air with it when he is really fired up . Off The Corner , he is a quiet , gentle man who weighs every word . He speaks calmly of attempts that have been made on his life , and of " outside pressures " exerted to remove him from The Corner . " You 're good if you keep your mouth shut , " he said , smiling . " If not , you 're bad and have to he wiped out . " We asked Kenyatta how he happened to start speaking on The Corner . " Just took it , " he replied . " When Malcolm died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a conversation here . But time went on . I took my shotgun and told people to come on , not to be afraid . On my first appearance here , three carloads of Muslims drove up , and instead of getting weaker I got stronger . I had been a Muslim , but when I saw what that had done to Malcolm , I broke away . Malcolm 's whole trouble was that he got caught up in that religious bag . A person who leads must be unwilling to compromise . He must be able to go into the alleys and byways and get those who are not in love with material things to bring about this revolution . I start here , on this corner , at the crossroads of the world . " That Saturday , Kenyatta , upon arriving on The Corner , began to shout without any warmup , " This is your day ! You livin ' in your day ! You got to band together and live as free men and women or die as damn fools ! You got to voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You tell ' em , brother ! " a loud voice called out . " Preach on , man ! " several people adjured simultaneously . " Man , the middle class tried to sleep through this , " a well-dressed Negro in the crowd said to no one in particular . " Well , we did n't . We 're awake now , and we 're finding out that seventy per cent of what this man is saving is true . " After a few minutes , three police cars and a banana cart rolled up . A young Negro policeman made his way through the crowd and stopped in front of Kenyatta . A blind man tapping a cane approached , and a few people looked around . The blind man stopped for a moment , then moved on . The tapping of his cane was the only thing to be heard as the policeman wrote out a summons and handed it to Kenyatta , who did n't have a permit to speak that day . When the policeman had left , several people in the crowd passed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling , leaped onto the hood of a blue Oldsmobile  --  his own . " This is the story of the day , " he said . " These people want to hear the truth . I 'm just someone here to voice their opinions . " By then , all three police cars had moved on , and only the banana cart remained . ?
