On the need for some kind of federal aid to education , most members of Congress are pretty well agreed . The crowded classrooms , decaying school buildings and swarming moppets , products of the postwar baby boom , are too inescapably evident to be ignored . The Senate passed a hefty education bill in February , and last week , at the urging of Vice President Nixon , the Administration moved toward acceptance of a Democratic-type education program , despite President Eisenhower 's distaste for direct federal subsidies . <P> But when the House education bill ( calling for $1.3 billion over four years ) came up for debate at midweek , the House put on a messy display of cross-purposed confusion . Amendments and proposals that would kill or maim the bill popped up and down like ducks at a sideshow shooting gallery . The Congressman whose proposal did the most harm was New York Democrat Adam Clayton Powell Jr. , political boss of Harlem . He insisted on attaching the old familiar " Powell Amendment , " a rider that would withhold federal funds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisance amendment , sometimes killing a decent bill because Southerners balk . In a bipartisan attempt to save school aid , the Administration offered House Democratic leaders a substitute measure similar to the Democratic bill . They agreed to the substitution , and if the maneuver had worked , it would have neatly sidestepped the Powell Amendment . But Indiana 's House Minority Leader Charles Halleck , determined foe of federal school aid , torpedoed the plan with a firm count-me-out . The Democratic bill passed with the Powell Amendment attached , and Senate Southerners loosed the predictable howls . Alabama 's Lister Hill , chairman of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee , vowed " unalterable and unequivocal " rejection of any measure that included the Powell Amendment .
