txt Veterans attending school under the GI bill are n't so sure they 'll find a special present under their Christmas trees . Until a few days ago it seemed they would . It had looked as though by Christmas Congress would boost between 27 and 46 percent the amount of money they get for school and living expenses . But President Nixon has put a damper on veterans ' optimism . He says the 46 percent boost in the Senate bill is inflationary , and hints he might veto it . The House already has passed a bill with a 27 percent hike . The President says he favors only a 13 percent increase . If the Senate passes its bill , there 's expected to be a Senate-House conference in the next few weeks to work out a compromise . Looming large over conferees ' shoulders will be that man in the White Houses And he should be a powerful force in holding the rate increase to the lower House levels . The President 's Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue is in danger of going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something fast about it . And that 's just what it 's been asked to do . New plans had been approved to get the renovation of the avenue completed in time for the 1976 bicentennial . A few days later Congress completely eliminated the meager funds ( $77,000 ) for the commission . The commission , established by executive order of President Johnson in March , 1965 , had presented its plans to President Nixon after a recent meeting . The President enthusiastically had approved them . The appeal going to the President will be for him to set aside , out of his own contingency funds , $48,000 . This could keep the commission running at least until June 30 . Arguments in favor of this assistance are expected at high levels . Vice-chairman of the commission is none other than Prof. Daniel P. Moynihan , the President 's chief adviser for urban affairs . How and why ... A classic case for compromise ? The House of Representatives votes $2 million for plans to build an extension to the deteriorating west front of the Capitol . It votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then votes nothing for extension plans , but $250,000 to study the feasibility of restoration . But , no sooner has the final Senate vote been taken than Senate restoration forces express apprehension over the way a Senate-House conference committee will resolve the stark differences . On the surface the obvious compromise is to approve both things  --  a study of restoration and plans for extension . Congress could choose between them later . However , some restoration advocates glumly fear the conference might adopt the House bill in toto  --  and leave restoration out in the cold . What 's ahead ... Possible rough stuff during the second Vietnam moratorium ? The administration is bracing itself for this possibility . Moratorium leaders are given good marks for responsible behavior by high American officials concerned with public order . " But there are two groups , " said one of these . " We do n't expect the moratorium people to change their position and encourage any forms of violence . " But others who want to bring in their whole range of grievances against the government as well as Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well cause serious disturbances . " President Nixon 's Nov. 3 address coming a little more than a week before the moratorium , could either ease or intensify the frustrations of the second group . Outlook , therefore , is unpredictable . This is the track chief critics of the Vietnam war are expected to follow : They will not yet take a position on Mr. Nixon 's role in winding clown the war . They will wait until after his scheduled Nov. 3 speech to the nation . Then they will decide whether to : Approve , disapprove. or take an in-between position and put moderate pressure on the President to hurry up . With this decision made , they will then turn hearings before various committees and subcommittees , on bills that would advise and indirectly limit the President on Vietnam , in hostile or friendly directions . So Nov. 3 becomes a key date in the war 's deescalation . It will turn the country back toward essential unity on what constitutes a reasonable settlement and how to obtain it , or split it again as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
