txt Former Gen. Maurice Challe , the principal leader in the four-day French Army mutiny in Algeria , was flown to Paris this afternoon and locked up in the Saut ? prison . His imprisonment was a first step in the campaign by the French Government to seek stern punishment of the leaders of the military coup . The Government gave notice that it would purge all civil and military officials of doubtful loyalty . A magistrate went to Sante prison to read to former General Challe accusations that he had illegally assumed command ' and set on foot an insurrection , and set on foot an insurrection . The first charge is punishable by life imprisonment , the second by death . It was reported earlier that the former general had disappeared from Algiers Silence on Three Others There was silence on the whereabouts of the three senior members of the military cabal who with M. Challe seized control of Algiers early Saturday and , for two nights , threatened to invade Paris to overthrow President de Gaulle . A dispatch from Algiers said that all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all stripped of their rank by Government decree , are former Gen. Edmond Jouhaud , like M. Challe , an Air Force officer ; former Gen. Raoul Salan , like M. Challe , a former commander in chief in Algeria , and former Gen. Andre Zeller . All four left the Algiers administration building early in the day for an undisclosed destination after their coup , mounted to block General de Gaulle 's efforts to bring peace to Algeria by granting independence to the Moslem nationalists , failed miserably last night . French officials here and in ' Algeria were silent on how M. Challe came into their hands . ' Yesterday evening he sent an officer , Col. Georges de Boissieu , to Paris by air with a letter offering to place himself " at the disposition of justice . " His flight , from the Algiers administration building appeared to be a disavowal of his earlier offer . It was not revealed tonight whether he had subsequently surrendered  --  the most proba- ble explanation since those with whom he fled were still at liberty ? or had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutiny indicated that the generals ' cabal had never been as strong as it had been made to appear by the captured Algiers radio . The generals ' power rested on a relatively small coterie of like-minded officers , on a few regiments of professional troops , notably the Foreign Legion , and on the complaisance of other officers and units who preferred to wait it out rather than engage in a shooting war with other Frenchmen . Only One Company Left When it became clear that President de Gaulle and the millions of Frenchmen who rallied to his defense would not yield to bluff , the waverers fell off , the loyalists took heart and the generals were left with nothing , at the end , but about one company of Legionnaires , just enough to cover their retreat from Algiers . The immediate results and consequences of the collapse of the mutiny were these : 4IThere was an immediate likelihood of the early opening of peace negotiations with the Moslem nationalist Provisional Government , which has carried on guerrilla warfare against French rule for six and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for April 7 but was canceled by the nationalists for reasons still obscure . The meeting had appeared again to be imminent when the mutiny exploded Saturday . IlThe European population of Algeria , which had looked to the mutineers to save " French Algeria , " appeared to be reduced to mute despair before the prospect of negotiations with the Moslem rebels that seemed certain to produce an Algerian republic in which the Moslems would be predominant . France appeared the beginnings of a long and probably acrimonious debate between the Gaullists and Left-wing forces as to whether it was General de Gaulle 's firm leadership or popular opposition to the mutineers that contributed most to the saving of the republic . This was likely to be marked by increasing restiveness of the Left-wing forces under the special powers assumed by President de Gaulle to meet the emergency . 4IThe possibility appeared that , gradually , France might take steps to neutralize the Foreign Legionnaires and other hard-bitten professional troops who succeeded in overthrowing one republic ? the Fourth ? in May , 1958 , and threatened the Fifth during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrenoire , Minister of Information , hinted at such action in his comments to the press on the events of the crisis after a Cabinet meeting today . In response to questions on the involvement of the Foreign , Legion in the mutiny , the Minister said that it had been units of the " general reserve " in Algeria that had spread the rebellion . The " general reserve " is composed of tough , shock troops ? the Legion , colonial and metropolitan paratroopers  --  whose officers , non-commissioned officers and large numbers of other ranks are professionals . The Minister said it was the opposition of the sector commands , manned largely by line regiments of predominantly conscript character , that had opposed the mutiny and finally brought it down . These remarks seemed to many observers to presage some Government action to protect France from any further adventures by the military professionals . General severity was the the theme of Premier Michel Debit 's speech to the nation on television tonight . " The trial was brutal , " he said . " Its brevity should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid re-establishment of order obscure from view the convulsions and renewals that are still possible . " Loyal Officials Thanked He thanked the many loyal civilian and military officials who had displayed unflinching loyalty in the crisis  --  a great majority , he said . " There are epochs in which the nation and liberty are easily defended , " he continued . " There are other epochs in which , for the nation and liberty , the law must be more strict and discipline more exigent . " If the Government , in the months to come , appears tougher with regard to certain interests , tell yourself that it is to restore to the state the firmness that the epoch in which we live renders indispensable . " The same theme was sounded even more specifically by M. Terrenoire in his Cabinet commentary . General de Gaulle , he said , had indicated the first consequences he foresaw for the present and future as a result of the " crisis that menaced the state . " These words were taken to cover the President 's intent to weed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of lukewarm or doubtful loyalty in the recent trial . How , for instance , did former General Challe , whose advance retirement from the air force in January at his own request clearly signified an attitude of dissidence toward Government policy in Algeria , manage to get to Algeria without the complicity of officials was one question being asked in political circles . Cabinet Shift Possible There were unconfirmed rumors also that President de Gaulle contemplated some Cabinet changes to eliminate Ministers whose performance under stress was adjudged deficient and advance others who were the mainstays of the Government during the crisis . " In the first hours of the rebellion the state certainly was nearly abandoned by those whose mission it was to support it , " M. Terrenoire said today . " That must not happen again . The state must be strong , solid . It must not be at the mercy of any subversion . " M. Challe , an unimpressive figure in rumpled civilian clothes , arrived at Villacoublay military airport a few minutes Carrying his own suitcase , M. Challe descended the ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Policemen helped him to his feet and he entered a police van for the trip to the Sante prison on the southern outskirts of Paris . There Henry Theret , vice dean of the Paris examining magistrates , charged with investigation of the generals ' mutiny , read M. Challe accusations of illegal assumption of command and leadership of an insurrection . The first charge is punishable by life imprisonment , the second by the death penalty . Three lesser figures of the mutiny were also in custody without formal charges . Lieut . Gen. Marie-Michel Gou raud , commander of the Constantine department , heralded as one of the loyal heroes of the first days of the mutiny , was under fortress arrest . He had wavered and gone temporarily over to the rebels Sunday . Yesterday , however , he went on the air in Constantine to say that he had been constrained to adhere to a movement of which he disapproved and to call all Frenchmen of his department back to duty and fidelity .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
