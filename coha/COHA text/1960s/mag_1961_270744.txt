Kwamina ( book by Robert Alan Aurthur ; music and lyrics by Richard Adler ) is the name of the London-educated , medically trained son ( Terry Carter ) of a dying black African chief , who returns from England to break the hold of an evil witch doctor ( Brock Peters ) on his superstitious people . Defying racial taboos , he falls in love with a white doctor ( Sally Ann Howes ) . At this point there are enough doctors on stage to perform much-needed surgery on the script , but they never operate . <P> Kwamina tries to dance and drum its way out of its plotty doldrums and deadweight writing . Thanks to Choreographer Agnes de Mille , it sometimes does . Sinuously quivering shoulders and hypnotically swiveling hips make the stage thrum with barbaric force and sensual splendor , most notably in Mammy Traders . But the dances are less show builders than clock stoppers . Between them , the wordy worthy talk ticks on . The interracial love affair is played with such fastidious good taste by Terry Carter and Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern African of Kwamina 's sort sometimes calls himself a Bintu , meaning " been to " Oxford or Cambridge . Broadway-born and bred , Kwamina has been to the latest headlines , but it never gets to the heart , in or out of Africa .
