A Frenchman created rayon back in 1884 , and European textile makers began weaving fabrics out of nylon a year after Du Pont developed it in 1938 . But the havoc of World War II and a certain resistance to wash-and-wear and wrinkle-free clothes made Europe lag behind the switch to synthetic fibers that swept the U.S. in the 1950s . Now Europe is making up for lost time . Synthetic fibers have become a $2.6 billion business in Western Europe v. $2.4 billion in the U.S. Close to two dozen new chemical-based fiber plants are being built in Europe ( v. four going up in the U.S. ) . <P> Less Rumpled . Slow to get used to the feel of the latest synthetics , Europeans are taking to the wool-like acrylics ( such as Orion ) and the moisture-proof polyesters ( Dacron ) with a will . Even wool-conscious Britain has accepted the addition of synthetics to wool , which makes for more durable pleats and a less rumpled look . Five years ago , the German clothing industry used almost no synthetics ; now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has transformed the brassiere and girdle business by introducing Du Font 's stretchable Lycra fiber . The Swedes practically live in synthetic parkas and stretch pants during the winter . Such designers as Pucci and Courrges make dramatic use of the new fibers in their creations . <P> By far the biggest boom is in nylon , which is woven into tire cord and tennis nets , safety belts , inflatable domes and underwear . Italy 's Snia Viscosa is spending $72 million on nylon expansion , has formed a traveling choir to promote its nylon-based Lilion fiber . Britain 's Imperial Chemical and Courtaulds both had to ration nylon shipments to weavers last year , are spending more than $150 million to double their productive capacity . Germany 's Glanzstoff and Farbenfabriken Bayer are also doubling their nylon output . <P> No Real Danger . The fiber makers are crossing borders and oceans to vie for markets . Courtaulds is building plants in Sweden , Imperial in Portugal , Holland 's Algemene Kunstzijde Unie ( A.K.U. ) in Spain . Farbenfabriken is building in Belgium , Chemstrand in Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Dacron and nylon plant in Germany next year . <P> How will Europe be able to absorb this output when it begins flooding the market in the next three years ? Despite warnings that capacity might rise faster than demand , fiber makers see little real danger ahead . Competition should mean lower prices , thus bigger markets . The biggest reason for optimism is the European consumer . Though synthetic-fiber production has doubled in five years , the average Frenchman still owns only two suits , and the average German woman still buys half as many girdles and bras as her U.S. counterpart .
