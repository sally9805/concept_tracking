For almost a year , Northern Ireland has been rocked by stabbings , shootings , bombings and riots that have left scores injured and three dead . Behind the trouble is a growing tension between Northern Ireland 's 1,250,000 Protestants loyal to the Queen and the country 's 500,000 Roman Catholics , who want closer ties with the Catholic-dominated Republic of Ireland . Last week Prime Minister Terence O'Neill 's government took its first legal action against the man who has stirred up much of the recent trouble . He is big , garrulous Rev. Ian Paisley , 40 , leader of Northern Ireland 's Free Presbyterian Church . <P> Religious antagonisms have long been strong in Ireland , especially since 1690 , when Britain 's " Glorious Revolution " secured Protestant ascendancy to Ulster . To try to ease the old hatreds , Protestant O'Neill broke all precedent last year by inviting the Republic of Ireland 's Catholic Premier Sean Lemass to Belfast . It was then that Paisley , fearing a sellout to the Catholics , began stumping Ulster 's six counties , attacking everyone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archbishop of Canterbury ( " another traitor " ) . " O'Neill might as well try to stop Niagara Falls with a teaspoon . " Paisley stormed , " as try to stop our Protestant cause . " When Queen Elizabeth arrived in Belfast this month to dedicate a bridge , embittered Catholics promised retaliation ; and sure enough , a twelve-pound chunk of concrete came crashing down on her car from a fourth-floor window on her parade route , luckily only denting the hood . <P> Blaming his fellow Protestants for most of the violence , O'Neill outlawed an anti-Catholic band of hotheads called the Ulster Volunteer Force . Then the government ordered Paisley and six of his cohorts to stand trial on charges of unlawful assembly and inciting a riot last month in Belfast . Last week Paisley and five of his six companions were found guilty , ordered to pay a 30 ( $84 ) fine and to promise to keep the peace for two years . When Paisley refused , he was ordered imprisoned for three months . <P> " The latter-day Rome , " Paisley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " once again dips her hands in the blood of saints , and is drunk with the blood of saints . " The saint would return , Paisley promised , and even run for Parliament . Within hours , fresh signs blossomed on buildings and sidewalks : " Paisley for Prime Minister . " And by week 's end , angry mobs of Protestants had taken to the streets , smashing windows , overturning cars , and battling police .
