Mr. Smith is a Sacramento newspaper man , who covers politics and the State Capital . Stockton , Calif . Until a few minutes after midnight last June 2 , Cliff Watkins had much going for him ; certainly more than most , black men  --  or white men , for that matter . A col-lege graduate , earning $8,000 a year at the start of a career in the federal Public Health Service , highly thought ' of by his fellow employees and his supervisors , the 24-year-old Watkins was a rising member of the Negro middle class . Today he is awaiting trial set for December 10 on a charge of armed robbery . He is accused of participating , with his older brother , Ted , in the robbery of a liquor store in this northern San Joaquin Valley community . Only Cliff is being tried . Ted was killed by four bullets fired by the store manager . Stockton law-enforcement officials are upset by suggestions that the incidents surrounding the death of Ted Watkins and the mess in which Cliff Watkins finds himself should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have phrased it " a classic , " case of armed robbery of a liquor store . But a number of doubts are being raised over the police handling of the case and the quick acceptance by officials of the view that the violence erupting in the Delta Liquors and Sporting Goods Store was just another instance of a couple of Negroes pulling a cheap robbery . The questions are being asked not only by the black community of Stockton but also thousands of miles away in Canada where Ted Watkins was a star professional football player for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and earned $15,000 a year . The relative affluence of the two young men ? Ted was 27 ? and their clean backgrounds are some of the reasons why Canadian newsmen , sent to investigate the case , question the official version of what happened . Operating one of Stockton 's sixty-five liquor stores is no easy business , Holdups seem to be increasing in the area from year to year , and liquor store clerks are the frequent victims , One elderly clerk was shot to death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accused of that murder and await trial . Many liquor store operators in Stockton take advantage of California 's lax gun-control laws to keep firearms handy . Fred Larsen , 25 , the white manager of the Delta , demonstrated his proficiency with a gun in 1966 , when he put two bullets into an obscure black man , Lonnell Perry . Larsen said Perry swung on him with a can of beer while attempting to rob the store . Captured , patched up and hauled into court , Perry pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and was sentenced to a year in jail . He was paroled in two months . Before dropping out of sight again , Perry said that he had not really tried to rob the store but had pleaded guilty in the belief that his word , from one VIE NATioNIOctober 28 . , ' J968 with a criminal record , would not be accepted and in the hope that he would thus get a light sentence . Perry claimed , . a fight had developed when Larsen , in the heat of an ar- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here . " No one paid much attention to the incident at the time . From 1959 , when Ted Watkins made a high school All-America team in Modesto , 30 miles south of Stockton , he was not obscure . His proficiency at football and other sports won him an athletic scholarship to the University of the Pacific in Stockton where , he was an outstanding performer until he abruptly quit college before graduating . He then signed a contract to play football with the Ottawa Rough Riders in Canada . Some who knew him at that time say Ted Watkins was moody and restless . Other friends recall that he was becoming increasingly concerned over the plight of the black man . He was not happy in Ottawa and was traded to Hamilton 's Tiger-Cats in southern Ontario where he got along well . His football associates and his neighbors in the Hamilton suburb of Burlington thought highly of him . But his concern over racial matters deepened , and led lihn into the Black Power movement in Canada , an involvement which was to be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something to do with the publication of a mimeographed sheet , Al Kita Sudan or The Black Book , and was also active in the Afro-American Liberation Fund , After the assassination of Martin Luther 429 King , he took part in a demonstration before the American consulate in Toronto . When he said publicly that bias against Negroes was evident in Ottawa , he was persuaded to discuss race relations on Canadian television . He spoke gloomily of the likelihood that race riots would occur in Canada when black immigration from the United States had increased substantially . His younger brother , Cliff , seems a less complex , possibly less interesting , personality than Ted Watkins . But Cliff Watkins gives the impression of being a steady , very likable man . He inspires confidence . After being arrested , he offered to resign his Public Health Service position , but his supervisors refused the offer . Instead , they confirmed a promotion which was due him . He turned that down " until this thing is cleared up . " Cliff Watkins ' fellow employees in Stockton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contributions to it recently totaled $1,800 . Other colleagues have been assisting the defense by conducting investigations into various aspects of the case . Funds are also being raised in Canada for the widow and daughters of Ted Watkins . Cliff , too , was named to a high school All-American team . Oregon State University gave him a football scholarship , and he played in the backfield in the 1966 Rose Bowl game . Professional teams showed interest , but that career was closed to him by a neck injury he suffered in college football . He was graduated from college as a sociology major , and has been working toward a master 's degree in psychology . His marriage to a white college classmate ended in divorce after they had one child . Last year Cliff Watkins joined the Public Health Service as a communicable disease specialist seeking to identify and have treated those who carry syphilis . Nearing the end of his vacation with his wife and four small daughters , Ted Watkins called on his brother at his Sacramento apartment early in the evening of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then headed south toward Stockton , 45 miles down the freeway . The evening there was spent with friends Ted had made while attending the University of the Pacific . They drank wine : Cliff says he did not have much . About midnight they were in the car again , going through south Stockton toward the freeway for the drive back to Sacramento . But Ted pulled the car off West Charter Way to stop near the Delta Liquors and Sporting Goods Store . Cliff says his brother wanted to buy another bottle of wine and some potato chips . It was a store Ted had patronized when he lived in Stockton. - Cliff browsed at the magazine stand , while Ted approached Fred Larsen , who was at the cash register . Another employee was in the rear of the store and a. third was outside by the trash cans . Cliff says he did not hear what passed between his brother and Larsen  --  a radio was playing and a store motor also muffled the conversation  --  but he gradually became aware that a dispute had developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a hate look " on Larsen 's face . He says that Negroes know what a hate look is . With a few vital differences , Cliff Watkins ' story of what happened during the next seconds agrees with the version accepted by the police . But the few differences are why Cliff Watkins is standing trial for armed robbery . Ted swung on Larsen . District Attorney Laurence Drivon , basing his statement on Larsen 's story , says Ted used the wine bottle as a club  --  the weapon in the armed robbery . Cliff says he did not notice whether or not the bottle was in his brother 's hand . Then Ted leaped over the counter . Larsen raised his pistol . Larsen told the police the weapon was under the counter ; Cliff says he is convinced Larsen drew it from his person . The younger brother rushed forward . In the most vital difference of all between the two accounts , Cliff says he was trying to stop the fight , while Larsen says Cliff reached into the cash register and took money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Cliff , before the men fell halfway through a plate-glass window , the shattered glass nearly severing Ted 's arm . Cliff says he rushed out the front door and around to the window in which the men were lying , Larsen on the bottom , the limp body of Ted Watkins on top of him . From his supine position , Larsen , as Cliff recalls it , raised his pistol back over his head and fired at the younger brother as he approached . Cliff retreated several steps and , while hesitating , was shot by another armed employee of the store , Louis Huerta , who had run from behind the store . After shooting Cliff , Huerta fled into the store while Cliff , struck in the shoulder by a bullet which also entered his lung , ran to the automobile in which Ted had left the keys in the ignition . Thinking Ted dead and believing that he also might be dying , Cliff drove to Sacramento . An issue , subsidiary in pending trial , but which has stirred black resentment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Watkins to a hospital to see if his life might be saved ? A militant black , Ralph Lee White , later charged that the first police on the scene showed more interest in finding Cliff Watkins than in attending his gravely wounded brother . White says he urged officers to help Ted but was told to keep out of the way . Stockton Police Chief Jack O'Keefe the next day denied that there had been any avoidable delay in getting Ted Watkins to the hospital . O'Keefe said the police were first called at 12:30 A.M. and only nineteen minutes later had delivered Watkins to the San Joaquin General Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival . However , a Toronto Star Weekly reporter later quoted a Stockton bail bondsman as saying that he had heard of a reported shooting at the store when he was in the Stockton jail , looking after the interest of a client , at a time no later than 12:06 or 12.07 A.M. Cliff Watkins had meanwhile driven to Sacramento . Stopping at a friend 's house , he telephoned a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers found him there as he was being treated . Press coverage of the case has been much greater than for a run-of-the-mill liquor store shooting . Canadian THE NATION/October ? 28 , 1963 newspapers , radio and television stations , especially , have bombarded law-enforcement authorities with questions . District Attorney Drivon responded thirty-six hours after the shooting with a general statement in which he , accepted Larsen 's version of the event . He said : The investigation of the incident at the Delta Liquors ' and Sporting Goods Store , 519 West Charter Way on June 2 , 1968 , reveals that Theodore Watkins while in the perpetration of the robbery of Fred Earl Larsen , manager of said store , struck Larsen on the head with a bottle of wine , knocking Larsen backwards ; Larsen reached for his gun which was under the counter and Theodore Watkins came over the counter at Larsen . It was then that Larsen saw Clifford Watkins reach into the open cash register till and take some monies therefrom . Theodore Watkins then forced Larsen against the plate-glass window breaking same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and struggling with Theodore Watkins , Clifford Watkins ran outside and tried to grab the gun from Larsen . It was then that Larsen fired his gun at The  --  dore Watkins , four bullets entering Watkins ' upper torso resulting in the latter 's death . After reviewing all of the facts presented to me , I have concluded that the shooting of Theodore Watkins by Fred Larsen was in self-defense and in the prevention of a robbery and therefore justifiable . The investigation further justifies the prosecution of Clifford Watkins for robbery and , accordingly , a complaint charging him with the robbery of Fred Larsen has been issued this date in the Stockton Municipal Court . Except for this statement , law-enforcement authorities have established a nearly complete news blackout on details of the case . Queries to Drivon now get only an offer by him to read his statement first issued during the afternoon of June 3 . He has also said , in response to suggestions he may have made a mistake in issuing a statement flatly labeling Ted Watkins , a criminal , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hinted that , were it not for Supreme Court restrictions on pretrial statements , he could tell a story that would settle all doubts . " This is a classic case , in ' my mind , in which all the information as it develops should be laid out for all to see , " he asserted to one reporter . " I feel as though I 'm walking a high tightrope . I 'm afraid to ' go , one way or the other . " He has also denied that there are any living witnesses to the killing other than Larsen and the surviving Watkins . Apparently neither of the other two employees was able to see the events which Larsen and Drivon say constituted the act of robbery . Skeptical Canadian reporters were thorns in the side of official Stockton for several weeks after the shooting . District Attorney Drivon appears to have been bothered , less by the newsmen than were Police Chief O'Keefe and some other authorities . One Stockton jurist , Chris Papas , the senior municipal judge in the county and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( his family has been in that business in Stockton ever since prohibition ended ) , remarked acidly to one Canadian : " I wonder if the same interest would be shown if Watkins had killed the clerk instead . " Just because Ted Watkins played football does n't mean he could not have committed robbery , the judge told the reporter Judge Papas also inveighed agamst " these people who happen to feel because they are black the federal , state and local government owes them something . " Papas , a lower court judge , will not preside at Cliff " Watkins ' trial , but his remarks " portray the feelings of a representative of the Stockton establishment , of which he long has been , a prominent member . The judge wanted the reporter to understand he is no bigot . His family , he said , has a Negro family to dinner every Easter . In direct opposition to the official , Stockton position , associates and friends of the brothers show no disposition to accept the district attorney 's version of the affair . Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His behavior was always exemplary , and I just ca n't believe from anything that we saw of him in Hamilton that Ted could be involved in something like this . " But doubts about the case are engendered not solely by the esteem in which the two Watkins were held . There is also the matter of the bullets in Ted Watkins ' body . Cliff says he was aware of two shots being fired at Ted before he and Larsen crashed through the window . Then Larsen , still according to Cliff 's story , fired at him . Cliff says that before he fled , he did not hear or see other shots fired by Larsen . The autopsy disclosed that four bullets struck Ted Watkins . One hit him straight-on and fatally , right in the heart . Another struck him in the neck below the right ear , another in the left side , and the fourth completely from the rear , lodging below the left shoulder blade . The variety of angles appears unusual . And why would the brothers rob a liquor store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be remembered ? If a robbery was committed , it was an appallingly stupid crime . Both brothers were regarded as intelligent men . Why would they risk their careers , indeed their lives , in a cheap holdup ? They could scarcely have been that desperate for a small sum of money . But if not a robbery , what caused the fight ? The answer could be provided only if the conversation between Larsen and Ted Watkins , which Cliff says he could not hear , were known . Ted Watkins is dead . Fred Larsen is not talking to reporters . Whatever Stockton policemen may think about liquor stores , shootings and Negroes , the facts of the case transcend the routine clich  --  s , and it will be no ordinary trial that will begin in Stockton on December 10 . One Stockton black man , the militant Ralph Lee White , mentioned above , has commented : " Life would be a lot simpler for white folks around here if Ted Watkins had been just another nigger . " Lonnell Perry would probably be @ @ @ @
