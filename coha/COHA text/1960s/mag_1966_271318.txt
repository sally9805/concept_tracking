Virginia 's Prince Edward County , which has two separate school systems ( public for Negroes , private for whites ) , is learning the price of prejudice . It comes to $180,000 , which county officials will have to pay out of their own pockets . <P> In 1964 , county supervisors decided to give tuition grants to the private schools , summoned white parents and parceled out the money while a Negro parents ' suit to bar the grant was pending in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . The Negroes called this action a " midnight raid on the county treasury , " and the court ordered restoration of the funds . Now that the Supreme Court has refused to review the judgment , the supervisors will have to raise the cash or go to jail .
