txt Hundreds of New Yorkers went to City Hall yesterday and last night to hear , applaud and sometimes boo witnesses testifying on Mayor Wagner 's proposal to add fluorides to the city 's water supply to curb tooth decay . For the proposal , Dr. George James , City Health Commissioner , said it was a preventive approach that was the only way to meet increasing dental needs here . He said 38.6 per cent of schoolchildren had no dental care at all and 12.3 per cent were partially neglected . The totals in these categories increased 15 per cent in the last five years , he said . Leading off for the opponents was the Medical-Dental Committee on Evaluation of Fluoridation , said to represent 1,600 physicians , dentists and scientists . The foes argued that fluoridation would be unsafe , particularly for adults with chronic diseases . They called for further studies of long-time effects and meantime suggested such alternatives as individually controlled fluoride doses for children . Outlay at Issue For the first time , the Board of ? Estimate and the City ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At issue was an expense budget proposal to appropriate $565,000 to build nine fluoridation plants , with an estimate that $798,000 a year would be needed for operations . The hearing started at 10:13 A.M. yesterday . Early today , after 15 hours , 41 advocates and 31 opponents and one neutral had testified . No time had been taken out for meals . The first witness , Armand D'Angelo , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , said he was not arguing for or against fluoridation . But he testified that " fluorides can be injected accurately into the city water supply system " at the recommended dosage of one part per million , with a 0.1 part margin either way . He said the program could get under way in nine months . For the opposition , Dominick F. Paduano , a former Commissioner of Water Supply , asserted there would be " crustation and accumulation of fluorides " at various points of the 5,700-mile system of pipes the New York Times Dr. Fred Squier Dunn , of Lenox Hill Hospital staff , warns of possible dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opponents and proponents testified In one-hour turns apiece . Foes of fluoridation had the first innings , led by Dr. Simon Beisler , chief of urology of Roosevelt Hospital . They claimed the support of 36 organizations representing two million New ' Yorkers , or onefourth of the city 's population . Favoring fluoridation were such spokesmen as Dr. Luther L. Terry , Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service , who endorsed it " without reservation . " His agency , Dr. Terry said , " urges every community to make the benefits of fluoridation available to its citizens as soon as possible . " Proponents included repre sentatives of the State Health Department , American Dental Association , Citizens Committee for Children of New York City , local medical and dental groups , Community Council of Greater New York , Greater New York Hosiptal Association , various labor unions , the Citizens Budget Commission and Women 's City Club of New York . City officials generally reserved their positions . Mayor Wagner told newsmen : " My position has been stated previously very clearly . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one opponent if there was not enough basis for judgment in the 17 years of experience with fluoridation , now involving more than 1,200 cities in the United States and Canada . Referendum Suezested Borough President Abe Stark of Brooklyn , considered in favor of fluoridation when the issue was last debated strongly here in 1957 , questioned yesterday whether it might not be more desirable to have a referendum of the voters than to leave the issue to the elected officials . Councilman Edward V. Curry , Democrat , of Staten Island , who has already introduced a resolution tor a referendum on fluoridation , asked whether Surgeon General Terry would oppose deferment of fluoridation here for a year pending such a vote . Dr. Terry evoked boos when he said he felt no such vote was necessary . " New York City has the world 's biggest toothache , " Dr. James , the Health Commissioner , declared . Among schoolchildren , he said , 402,137 have complete dental neglect and 128,420 partial neglect . The city 's 2,000,000 children , he went on , develop an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect in Manhattan , Dr. James said , are Central Harlem , 62.6 ; East Harlem , 68.1 , and Riverside , 53.7 . In the Bronx , he noted , Morrisania reports 70.4 and Mott Haven 68.5 . In Brooklyn , Bedford shows 70.8 , Brownsville 51.5 , Bushwick 58.8 , Fort Greene 68.3 , Red Hook 60.9 and WilliamsburgGreenpoint 62.7 . It costs the Health Department $2.75 million a year to care for the 60,000 children who use its clinics , he saki . To take care of those still neglected , he said , would cost $30 million a year , and there just would not be enough dentists . But fluoridation , Dr. James argued , would prevent 60 per cent of cavities among youngsters , or four million a year . As to suggestions that individual fluoride tablets be administered instead , he said a study of 4,000 children in I'awaii showed that after four years , only one child in eight was still receiving doses , For the opposition , Dr. Beisler stressed that " if New York City fluoridates , others will follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constancy " in the dosage in the city system and argued that persons drinking a great deal of water would take in fluorides " far beyond the safety factor . " Supporting him , Dr. Fred Squier Dunn , a member of the Lenox Hill Hospital staff , said the only possible benefits ? which he called " dubious " ? would be for children from birth to 8 years of age , one-eighth of the population . He saw no benefits and " probably considerable harm " to older people . In areas with naturally fluoridated water , Dr. Dunn said , calcium fluoride is the prevailing compound . In artificial fluoridation , he said , sodium fluoride is used and is 400 times more soluble and " 400 times more easily picked up by tissues . " A Cornell University study with rats , Dr. Dunn said , showed no effects on tissues after 180 days ' dosage with sodium fluoride . But after a full 520-day life span , he said , many showed " degenerative lesions , " This , he said , indicated there should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ' experience instead of the present 17 . Mass Education Urged Carlton Fredericks , who described himself as a public health educator , spoke against fluoridation and asserted it was an " expensive substitute for education . " The principal cause of tooth decay , he said , is the use of sugar , averaging 100 pounds per person throughout the nation each year . Mr. Paduano , the former Water Supply Commissioner who now is a member of the State Workmen 's Compensation Board , pictured fluorides as linked with what he called increased death rates from chronic diseases In Newburgh , N. Y. , and Grand Rapids , Mich . Dr. Edward R. Schlesinger , assistant state health commissioner , denied that there had been any such increase in Newburgh , and said there had been a misuse of statistics in a Grand Rapids rep.ort . Under questioning by Councilman Curry , Surgeon General Terry said he had " not one bit of scientific evidence " that there have been any harmful effects from fluoridation . " I feel as safe in making that assurance to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any scientific point presented to me , " Dr. Terry said . Dr. Fredrick J. Stare , chairman of the Harvard University department of nutrition , criticized The New York Times for headlining a story from Britain : " Fluoride Study Brings Warning ; Britons Find Cell Growth Slowed in Experiments . " Dr. Stare said the facts inmlved a letter in the British Aedical Journal  --  not . a report  --  and a study only of one type human cancer cell and one type of mouse cancer cell in test tubes . There was " no evidence that cells with normal growth " were affected by the 1/20th part per million of fluoride used , he said . There might even be an " intriguing hypothesis , " he went on , that " the constant leve. of a small amount of fluoride in the blood serum may be one of nature 's protective mechanisms for too rapid growth of abnormal cells such as cancer acme " Nobel Opponent Quoted Councilman Curry , brought from Dr. Stare an acknowledgment that he did not consider Dr. Hugo Theorell , 1955 Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Staten Island legislator then read a cablegram sent by Dr. Theorell last Thursday to former Mayor William B. Hartsfield of Atlanta . It said : " I still feel , as 1958 , much more research needed before fluoridating drinking water acceptable . My recommendation of Norrkoeping experiment being extended to 1967 in agreement herewith . I recommended members of Swedish Parliament last year to vote against general fluoridation permission . Decision taken accordingly . " Organizations opposing fluoridation included the Christian science Committee on Publication , Greater New York Committee Opposed to Fluoridation , Association for the Protection A Our Water Supply , Bay Ridge Medical Society , and the : lonservatiye party , Among the better-known witnesses favoring the progrant were Dr. Benjamin pock of Cleveland , authority pri baby care , and Dr. David B. Ast , director of dental health for the State Health Department . Dr. Ast , since 1944 , has supervised the comparative studies of Newburgh , which artificially fluoridated its water , and Kingston , which did not . He said he had " never seen such beautiful teeth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last school year , he said , it took 77 minutes ' and a cost of $13.14 to treat Newburgh children aged 5 to 7 through state mobile dental units ; it took 117 minutes and $28.49 to treat Kingston youngsters of the same ages , he reported . Late last night , Vito Battista , representing the United Taxpayers party in opposition to fluoridation , told the joint ' hearing that newspaper stories made it look as though Mayor Wagner thought he had the proposal won . The Mayor angrily interrupted to assert he had never spoken with members of the Council or Board of Estimate about fluoridation . Late last night Vito Battista of the United Taxpayers party and Mrs. Helen M. Clark , former president of the New York City Federation of Women 's Clubs , told the joint hearing that newspaper stories had made it look as though Mayor Wagner thought he had the proposal won . But the Mayor angrily interrupted to assert he had never spoken with members of the Board of Estimate about fluoridation . " No one has been asked their position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , " Mr. Wagner declared .
