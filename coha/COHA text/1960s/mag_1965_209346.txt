Quietly but firmly , the U.S. has taken the unusual step of declaring economic warfare against a company that is supported by a friendly government . The company is France 's Le Nickel , whose sales of $53 million make it the world 's third largest producer ( after Canada 's International Nickel and Falconbridge Nickel ) of a scarce , strategically important metal . While the two governments are squabbling over the company 's activities , the protagonists range far beyond the Quai d'Orsay and Foggy Bottom . They include Fidel Castro , Mao Tse-tung , former French Premier Rene Mayer and those storied bankers , the Rothschilds . <P> Buying from Cuba . At issue is a U.S. order , invoked in August by the Treasury 's Office of Foreign Assets Control , that effectively bans U.S. imports of any products containing Le Nickel 's metal . In the past month customs inspectors in New York City and elsewhere have impounded six shipments of French stainless steel containing nickel that had presumably been supplied by Le Nickel . <P> Washington says that it has banned Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal in July to buy 33 million Ibs. of nickel oxide from Castro 's Cuba . The ban is based on the U.S. law prohibiting imports of products made from Cuban materials . Compounding the affront to the U.S. is the fact that Le Nickel agreed to purchase its nickel oxide from Cuba 's Nicaro plant , a rich source that had been owned by the U.S. Government and operated by National Lead Co. until Castro expropriated it in 1960 . <P> Le Nickel is backed by some powerful forces . While the Cuban deal was being negotiated , the company 's boss was Chairman Rene Mayer , who retired to the post of honorary chairman in January . The company is subsidized by the French government and controlled by the French Rothschilds , who are particularly close to Prime Minister Georges Pompidou , formerly the chief aide to Guy de Rothschild . Last month Guy de Rothschild and his brothers , owners of 10.6% of Le Nickel through several companies , carried out a complex exchange of stock to give them firmer control . <P> Proof &; Protests . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost by an act of God . Le Nickel 's main mines are in far-off New Caledonia , but a drought there cut the necessary supply of hydroelectric power and forced the company to look elsewhere for nickel oxide . Before turning to Castro , they tried to buy supplies from the 166,761-ton U.S. Government nickel stockpile , but Washington turned them down . Authorities of both Le Nickel and the French government buzz that the U.S. has another , more devious reason for boycotting Le Nickel : early this year the company closed a $20 million deal to sell 19 million Ibs. of finished nickel to Red China . Despite French denials , U.S. Commerce and State Department officers speculate that Charles de Gaulle 's government may have urged Le Nickel to make the sale in order to reduce its subsidy .
