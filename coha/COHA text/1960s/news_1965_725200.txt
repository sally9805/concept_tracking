txt Three polls made public today favored Pres.-iident de Gaulle to win tomorrow 's runoff election against , Francois Mitterrand for the French Presidency . The polls gave General de Gaulle a majority of 53.2 to 55 per cent . They were concluded 1 three days ago , before the end 1of the campaign . All three polls indicated that at least one out of five voters was still undecided at the time . The prevalent impression here was that General de Gaulle had succeeded in halting the trend that had been running against ; him since the beginning of the campaign for the first ballot , Dec. 5 . But no one knew for certain how far that trend had gone . Result of First Ballot Tomorrow 's runoff election became necessary when the general , against all expectations , failed lo win an absolute ( majority in the Dec. 5 election , , He received 43.7 per cent of the vote in continental France . Mr. Mitterrand , who is backed by the Communists , the Socialists and other left-wing groups , was the runner-up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The four other candidates were eliminated . During the campaign the two candidates touched on virtually every possible domestic and foreign issue . Their respective positions may be summed up like this : General de Gaulle warned that a Mitterrand victory would mean a return to the " impotent " and " debased . . . regime of political parties " and of " demagogues " that , he said , existed before his return to power in 1958 . Accusation by ' Mitterrand Mr. Mitterrand accused the general of abusing his personal power and leading the country . into authoritarianism . The general feels that his ; continued personal presence is needed to prevent France from falling into a state of " con- ; fusion . " Mr. Mitterrand has ! played down his personal role : and has called for a " republic of all citizens . " The debate between the two ; men was never more direct than last night in their windu television speeches . The general said : " The new , republic has its President . I am the one . Here I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to work for " progress , indepen-1 dence and peace . " Mr. Mitterrand said : " Who ' , . can pretend that France is ; nothing without him ? No , General de Gaulle , you are wrong . France does not belong to you . France does not identify herself with anybody but her people . " French policies concerning the European Common Market have been a major campaign issue . Mr. Mitterrand 's professions of faith in the future of a unified Europe have brought him the endorsement of such men as Jean alonnet , one of the initiators of the first steps toward European unity after World War IT . They have caused Jean Lecanuet , the middle-of-the-road candidate who ran third on the first ballot with 3.7 million votes , to incline toward Mr. Mitterrand . Advice from Lecanuet Mr. Lecanuet urged his followers not to vote for General de Gaulle but stopped short of an outright endorsement of Mr. Mitterrand . Like many other men of the center , he apparently finds it difficult to forget that Mr. . atitterrand has the backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest source of strength in the first round . But now it is his greatest single ! handicap in his attempt to get the additional votes without which he can not win . ( i One of the polls made public today was taken by the French ! Institute of Public Opinion . It ! said that 55 per cent of the ! voters who had made up their minds favored General de Gaulle . The institute was accurate ' within one per cent in predicting General de Gaulle 's vote on ( the first ballot but was much , farther off the mark with respect to the other candidates . The second poll , taken by the Company for Study and Soundings , said that 54 per cent of the voters who had reached a decision would vote for General de Gaulle . The third , taken by the students of a highly respected ! Ecole Superieure de Commerce , the national school for business administration , gave the General 53.2 per cent .                @ @ @ @ @
