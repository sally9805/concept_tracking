txt // reference to this earthshaking shift . Yet its implications seem both clear and relatively permanent : teachers used to get a thirdor fourth-class education ; now they are well on the way to getting a first-class education . And the number of persons who are attracted to and can accomplish a first-class education is smaller , and will remain smaller as far ahead as we can see . Already there are many signs that qualification for teaching will soon require a regular B.A. degree plus at least a year of specialized training , instead of the present pattern of about a quarter of the usual four-year work being devoted to " vocational " subjects . " Teacher " will come to mean not a person with less than a " real " bachelor 's degree , but one with at least a glimmer of true professional , post-graduate training . It can hardly surprise us if those who accomplish such training prove more demanding when they seek work . For generations our public schools have kept pace with population growth and school expansion by hiring cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help at work , with our children at their mercy . But clearly we have entered an era when cheap help teachers can no longer meet the requirements . The old source of teachers is useless now , and there is no adequate new source even in sight . Paradoxically , even as the demands that teachers be better prepared and more able reduce the supply so desperately needed , these demands are progressively stepped up , in large part by blistering public attacks on the institutions that educate teachers or dictate what their training shall be . In The Miseducation of American Teachers , Dr. James D. Koerner reported the findings of a two-year study of teacher education in blunt language . His conclusions in general are in firm agreement with other studies . There can be little doubt that education departments , even in highly regarded universities , usually attract an outsize share of students from the bottom of the academic barrel . Their faculties usually rate below the rest of the departments on almost any pertinent consideration . Indeed , one of the worst problems in raising standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those not in education on college faculties have tended // to sneer at and stay clear of their colleagues concerned with teacher training . The tendency has been lessened some recently by vigorous effort , as under sharp criticism administrations have moved to bring their education departments closer to their overall standards , and get the " educators " and " scholars " working together . - Much of the struggle revolves around control of certificates . Without a certificate , a teacher can not get a job , at least not on a full-fledged and official basis . It is therefore a powerful club as well as a control . Even with one , a teacher may not be able to take a job in a neighboring state , for in most cases the requirements for certification are extremely detailed , spelling out exactly what kind of courses must have been taken , for exactly how long . Naturally , colleges within a state provide the courses the state authorities prescribe . An establishment results which can be exceedingly difficult to combat or modernize . As Dr. Koerner pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full quarter of his time in college taking " education " courses rather than in subject or academic pursuits . An elementary school teacher may have taken up to half her work in such method and theory courses . Thus , for example , a teacher may have spent more time taking courses on how to teach English and how to manage a class than on English itself . I'o make matters worse , the education courses are often , if indeed not usually , of miserably poor quality . To quote from an article by Dr. Koerner : Not only are most prospective teachers inferior in quality to start with ; the training they receive , with its heavy emphasis on education courses , only serves to stifle what talents they have . I recently managed to look into a good many of these pedagogical courses , to survey extensively the materials used , and to talk with many hundreds of students involved in them . The students ' verdict is overwhelmingly negative ? often bitterly so , particularly among the better students , the kind most needed in teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I or the most part former school administrators and others // whose background in liberal arts is often on the skimpy side . The pedagogical courses , however poor , out-of-date , and useless they may be , are nevertheless the base for what prestige they have , and their bread and butter as well . Only a bombshell can shatter their tight ranks and mutual support . A pretty good bombshell exploded in September 1963 , when Dr. James B. Conant published The Education of American Teachers with its 27 specific recommendations for reform or improvement . The very first of these struck what may prove to be a mortal blow . It proposed that , in effect , states certify any legitimate college graduate who in the opinion of his college was qualified to teach , thus wiping aside all the detailed requirements as to specific education courses . Although there is a long way to go , Dr. Conant 's enormous prestige and the publicity his findings command has already had effect in more states than not.The combined forces against the state establishments promise to carry the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college education departments will enter the schools for years to come . But the requirements are steadily being raised . Colleges that have always accepted any student in the education department will more and more turn down the weakest applicants . Those that have almost never flunked out a student will begin doing so . Students taking genuine courses and studies rather than " serving time " in education courses will have to work harder . Higher standards attract better people ; but there is every reason to believe that for a long time ahead the net effect will be better teachers , but relatively fewer . There will not be enough , nearly enough , to staff our present system . It is hard to see any choice but to change the system . First , we have to get rid of the rigid organization that makes it mandatory to find another teacher for every 30 or so pupils . Second , since really good teachers are few , we must find a way of using what good ones we have as effectively as possible and not shut them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher in the school has . While we delay , our children and our nation pay the price . // School boards in some communities are composed of political hacks , serving to keep control in " the right hands . " More often they are a small , valiant band of leading citizens , conscientiously trying to discharge a volunteer job that seems to enmesh them in ever more varied duties and ever more complicated detail . On Monday evening a typical board of education member may pore over the pages of an inch-thick budget . On Tuesday he may meet with a neighborhood group to forestall complaints about changed districting . Wednesday may find him sitting in on a curriculum committee discussion with the superintendent , and Thursday may mean a board meeting which runs to 1 A.M. If he has nothing to do on Friday but worry about three new teacher resignations , Saturday morning may find him in the bowels of a school with an engineer , seeing at first hand the impending collapse of the heating system , which will mean that the funds for equipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even with a top-notch superintendent and a good staff to ease the burden , a board tends to be smothered under 55 the constant demand of decision-making : on plant , on finances , on personnel , on curriculum changes , on planning , on taxes , on legal and legislative matters , on integration , on textbooks , on equipment for classrooms , gymnasiums , and lunchrooms , on pensions , on standards , on guidance , on disciplinary problems , on athletics , on health measures , on public and community relations , among others . Where schools are in obvious trouble , the pressure to deal only with the emergency of the moment and plans for the immediate future is overwhelming . But even in those situations where the pace is gentler , boards commonly find , to quote one member : " We never have time to think ! " The mechanics of school operation get attention , rather than education . When those on the firing line , whether volunteers or paid personnel , do manage by some supreme effort to stand back l or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own local situation . Gigantic as is our national educational effort , it is guided and conducted by innumerable small units ; and in relation to the whole , the central state and federal education offices are puny in staff and resources . Such a structure makes it easy to be over-concerned with matters of the moment and chronically behind in adapting to conditions changing more rapidly and sweepingly than ever before in man 's history . Not surprisingly , major new concepts in education come almost entirely from the two extremes ? those in " ivory towers " far from the battle , and those so desperately engaged and threatened it It disaster that they damn the torpedoes , throw out the rules , and improvise on the spot . ' Phis book is concerned with stepping back , with examining some of our basic assumptions and habits of thought , apart from the innumerable variations local conditions may demild . Once we do , some of the concepts we may take for granted come to look highly questionable . Of these , I submit , none is more far-reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the notion that our schools must be organized on the teacher-and-class principle , the student body divided up into the largest affordable number of equal groups , a teacher assigned to each group , and each teacher-and-class unit put in // a separate classroom . The teacher-and-class arrangement is in such general use and had been for so long that the mere suggestion that there is nothing inevitable about it , and that it is only one of dozens of possible ways of organizing , comes as a shock to many persons , including , I have found , many persons intimately connected with education . Schools without classes ? Eyebrows go up , and that special tolerant expression appears , reserved for persons to be humored rather than argued with . Just so greeted were those who suggested that carriages might go without horses to pull them . Among those who had the open-mindedness and foresight to see what the motor car might soon offer , the term " automobile " soon came into use . But it is significant that for the public the term " horseless carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing amazement that what had seemed so indispensable was now found not to be necessary at all . If our schools change in the ways that seem to be indicated , we will probably go through a period during which citizens will marvel at " classless schools " in much the same manner . ( We already have " non-graded . " ) But I venture the prediction that a generation from now the whole idea of a class-and-classroom system will seem as quaint and antique as the surrey with the fringe on top . Children will listen with half-doubting frowns as we tell them how we used to spend an entire year in a group of thirty , with one teacher who tried to teach us everything under the sun , all in that one room . As they now say , " You did n't have any television when you were a child ? " ? trying to readjust in imagination to a life without the magic screen to command at the twist of a knob ? so they will try to picture our present type of school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we get rid of the word " class " and instead think in terms of fixed groupings and flexible groupings . Whether we consider our elementary schools , where the pupil is put in a fixed group for a term or a school year , or higher grades , where the group may be fixed only in relation to a certain course or subject , our present system is organized almost wholly on the fixed basis . But the flexible system is by no means entirely unfamiliar to // us . Most of our leading universities , for example , do not operate on the class principle . A freshman or sophomore may in the course of a day attend a lecture in a large , packed hall , go to a room to work with a group of fifteen or twenty , then to the library to work alone , then to a laboratory where attendance fluctuates , and finally to a discussion meeting with a tutor , limited to ten or twelve . It would never occur to the institution to count the students , divide the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would always gather in groups of the resulting size . Instead , it somehow seems obvious in the college environment that a professor can lecture to two hundred as well as to twenty , and that a discussion should be limited to a dozen and not attempted in a grouping far too large for the purpose . The college works on the exceedingly simple principle that the grouping should be suited to the educational function to be accomplished at the moment . We take this principle for granted in most everything we do . For sports , say , we group by twos or fours for tennis , by nines or a few more for baseball , and by any number we please for bowling . In music we do not establish a grouping of thirty and suggest that at one time the group play a quartet and at another it play a symphony . It seems clear that for quartets groups of four are indicated , and for the symphony perhaps a hundred would be better . Even the army , which once worked on a rigid grouping plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , specialists , and officers into " teams " according to the function they are currently assigned . But our schools seem to be immune to such common sense as grouping for the function to be performed . Instead , our children are counted off into administrative groups , exactly as sheep might be loaded into cattle cars according to how many each can conveniently accommodate . If the groupings turn out to be thirty , then the /unctions must be made to fit the groupings , however awkward , absurd or downright impossible this may be . So far as I can learn , no educator has come forward to Claim that twenty-five or thirty is a grouping desirable for basic educational purposes . It appears , in fact , to be about as ill-chosen . t figure as one could imagine . It is far too big for individual // attention to the pupil ; more than twice the limit usually set for true discussion groups ; too large for individual drilling or recitation and unnecessarily small for mass drill ; wastefully small for movies and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no particular virtue for music , art , lab work , shop work , or physical education that is readily discoverable . Even administratively , the fixed group type of organization brings a rash of tormenting problems as soon as the school seeks to make the mildest move towards modern education : recognizing individual differences and trying to realize each child 's full potential in spite of them . " In spite of them " it has to be , for if the fixed grouping is to work perfectly , the children in each class must be as alike as sheep , and have the considerate decency to grow , in every respect , at a uniform rate . To the degree that children are n't alike , or stubbornly refuse to oblige by growing at a uniform rate , the fixed grouping is strained . To propose to recognize and realize the differences among children , and at the same time put them in fixed groups , is to embark on the frustrating program of simultaneously heading in opposite directions . It seems absurd that we should have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to go North we should head North . Yet it seems essential to begin any discussion of the organization of our schools to state : we should group children , not according to any artificial , administrative , or traditional scheme , but to enable us best to carry on the educational functions that will achieve our broad aims . Although it would be most difficult to find any educator who will not agree that our aims have changed radically in the past seventy-five years , we are still using the same rigid teacherand-class grouping concept that was well established then . It is interesting to take a look at a largely forgotten system that was imported from England around 1800 and that flourished in our burgeoning cities for a third of a century . The need was for some means of accommodating a sudden rush of children at ( familiar theme ! ) a cost that would not rise , overwhelmingly , equally as fast . The education to be given was very simple , and the methods of the day depended largely on drill // and rote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One teacher could preside over a huge room in which perhaps two hundred pupils ( many more , in some instances ) were arranged at parallel long desks , each row in charge of a monitor , an older student . The monitors put their charges through carefully prescribed drills , each group using its own wall area . While the students studied their next lesson , the teacher taught the monitors around his desk . The plan was splendidly cheap and worked admirably in many cases . The perfection of order and discipline enabled the large student body to be controlled smoothly ; and yet there was a flexibility that permitted each pupil to advance to the next form and to the next monitor just as quickly as he could master his assignments . The system fell into disfavor only as the idea began to grow that children should be taught a good deal more than could be taught mainly by rote , and that perhaps they should even have some interest in what they were studying ? a fancy notion that stemmed , as did more revolutionary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the strange view that there might be virtue in children that could be brought out , instead of being beaten in . Physically , the Lancastrian plan began to break up into classrooms , as separate rooms with assistant instructors were set up to handle teaching of the monitors . For all the limitations of the Lancastrian schools from our present point of view , they stand as an excellent example of organization serving function . And it is probably not too much to claim for them that they kept the idea of free public education afloat at a time when the rapid growth of cities might have sunk it for years to come . More familiar , and dearer to our hearts because it has been so romanticized , is the one-room school so rooted in our national tradition ? another example to show that " school " does not necessarily mean " classes , " and one with features that a good many educators tend to admire wistfully today . The little red schoolhouse ( it was more often totally innocent of paint of any color , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was small because communities were small and transportation limited . The teacher // ( usually a woman in areas where male labor was scarce ) had the problem of instructing an extremely varied group , ranging widely in age , ability , accomplishment , and attendance . Except for such activities as praying , singing , listening to a story read aloud , and the like , dealing with the entire group as a " class " was impossible . If there were three boys at about the same level of skill in arithmetic , the teacher gathered them together for that instruction , then set them tasks while she worked with another grouping . We might consider these groupings small classes . But when she came to spelling , the groupings might be quite different . And as the children advanced at different rates , according to their energy , abilities , and attendance , her groupings constantly changed , too . In short , each grouping this teacher formed was solely in terms of the function she was trying to carry on at the moment ; grouping was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may doubt that some of these teachers , little more than barely literate themselves in many cases , could have explained their method in these terms ; what they did " came naturally , " out of the pressures of the situation . The one-room-school teacher usually had no training in teaching . She simply had to keep the school going , and there was no other way . And because function thus dictated organization , she accomplished a lot with an absolute minimum of resources . If her school failed to carry many pupils very far , at least it could be claimed that it held none back ? a claim our best rigid-class school can not make today , with a hundred times the resources . In the one-room school , the exceptionally intelligent student , the one with a thirst for more learning , was less likely to be regarded as a regrettable freak , upsetting regimentation the school was trying hard to keep neat . As our literature and history richly record , he left with enthusiasm undiminished by boredom , lack of personal attention , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it grows . The days come when the teacher can not handle so many children unassisted . Again she does what comes naturally , and makes use of one of the older girls to instruct the youngest . Later , when this girl is ready to leave school , the town fathers agree to pay her to // continue to assist the teacher . They also build a second room . And once more it is natural for the second teacher to take to the new room the children she was teaching , the younger and less advanced . It is startling to realize that this typical progression has actually accomplished , de facto , three decisions that are still deeply rooted in our public school system . One is that the less skilled , newer teacher should teach the younger pupils . In a day when the older teacher differed from the new by being surer of how the harder words were spelled and how to divide a six-digit number by a three-digit number , this made some sense . Whether it does today , when the new teacher is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duller one , or the one with the acutest disciplinary problems , is an open question . When the town fathers obligingly built a second room , another decision was made : that a school should grow by multiplying similar classrooms . The third decision was that classes should be divided primarily by age and scholastic attainment . We have seen how this could have come about " naturally . " It could also have resulted because the tradition of classes or forms in private Eastern schools , or in European schools , had influence . But it was a decision , one of many possible . The division could have been made on the basis of separating the sexes ? a plan that became popular , and that has some validity apart from " moral " reasons since male and female growth and learning patterns do differ . Or what we now call intelligence could have been the key factor , thus putting the fast learners all in the same room . Or size , age , and maturity might have been considered . Or no such division might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being set up as two one-room affairs , side by side . Or any basis of division might have been used with , in addition , the teachers dividing ? alternating , or taking certain subjects , or certain groups . We have by no means exhausted the list , but there is little point in carrying the exercise further . Obviously , there were many choices . And when the school doubled , and had four teachers and four rooms , there were still more combinations possible both for students and for teachers . The first division into two rooms foreshadowed another // principle of organization that now plagues our schools , the concept of " grade . " There had to be some basis for moving children from the " lower " room to the " upper , " some point at which he entered a new grade . " Grade , " of course , was still vague . The teachers had the great boon of being able to promote a single child any time they felt he was ready , rather than having to move a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various members of the group at various states of readiness to advance . In fact , some moderately daring educators today eye this advantage with envy , and cautiously put forward the idea of " time blocks " instead of yearly grades . For if we truly are interested in each child as an individual , and recognize that each in reality goes at his own pace , then we have to agree it is absurd to promote children by classes and only in June . As schools expanded , " grade " became more and more a dominant organizing idea . These early schools , we need to remember , had no such regular attendance as we take for granted now . As late as 1880 , the average student attended only 81 days , although the nominal year was much longer . The rural student ( and most of the country was rural ) went to school a good deal less , when farm work , family health , and road conditions permitted . Nor did children necessarily start school at any fixed age , or quit school after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from almost purely local affairs to parts of larger systems , with state help and regulation an ever-increasing influence , the rigid class-and-grade system we now have took command . It was helped along by a sudden admiration for the way things were done in , of all countries to serve as a model for a democracy , Prussia ! Flexibility was regarded almost with horror , as evidence of both laxness and backwardness . Good " management " became a fetish and a fashion in the later part of the century . School administrators boasted of the precision of their regimentation . The work each grade had to accomplish was minutely detailed and each child had to accomplish it within the same allotted period . Here , of course , arose another vexing problem still far from solved . What of the child who did n't accomplish it ? For years , he was simply left back to suffer the exquisite humiliation and slow torture of repeating the grade 's // work . Later it became fashionable to humiliate and torture him the reverse way , by thrusting him ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class-and-grade system stood forth nakedly , but as with the unclothed emperor in the old story , it was not polite to notice . One further indictment must be levied , one all too familiar to parents . I have asked dozens of them , " Did your child ever have a teacher who was incompatible , who disturbed him , made him dislike school , slowed his learning , or killed his interest in a subject ? " The answer has seldom been negative . More often it brings forth still bitter recriminations . My next question then is , " Do you think it desirable that a child should be tied to a single classroom teacher , or even subject teacher , for an entire term or school year ? " To raise the question is to answer it . In the one-room school there was reason to tie the child to one teacher , whatever the limitations of that teacher in meeting the needs of the child . In a school that has many teachers , this relationship appears to be a senseless abomination , especially in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can get , and deliver a hapless class into her clutches whether he believes her to be good , fair , or horrible . The system is justified by learned jargon about the young child 's need for the " security " of having only one adult to relate to . If the schools are right , our habit of having two parents would seem to be wrong . And one wonders why iii kindergartens , of all places , it is not remarkable to find two adults handling the group . The jargon seems to do little to disguise the apparent fact that the single teacher idea is part and parcel of the rigid class-and-grade system ? the obvious thing to do for administrative convenience . I am guilty , I must admit , of greatly oversimplifying the complicated history of our school system , which is crisscrossed by a thousand influences of one sort and other . But I think the vital point I am trying to make will scarcely be challenged : the class-and-grade system we have today and that we accept and tolerate without second thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best judgment of trained people calmly studying the problem , and nothing inevitable . It is // simply a monstrous mistake , costly in every sense , wholly unsuited to our present-day conditions , needs and views , which grew up like a weed in the past , and which educators as yet have not had the stomach and sense to cut down . The one virtue this system had , up to about a generation ago , was the old familiar cry . It was cheap . In its heyday , it permitted huge , regimented classes to be run by low-paid teachers . But today , it is n't even cheap . Its rigidity year by year adds fixed increments in cost , even while the inadequacy and irrelevance of instruction may become more apparent . School boards , apt to be clumsy and ineffectual even when things are going well , stagger under the impact of one financial squeeze after another and spend most of their time chasing funds or conspiring to win budget approvals at the polls . Teachers , scarcely aware of why they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrapheap and tote picket signs saying " Help the children " until they win raises by the crudest trade-union power plays , usually illegal . There is seldom prospect of relief , only of worse next year . A school system that is not deep in money trouble today is a rarity . What price this " cheap " system now ? Alternative measures may not cut taxes , for the trend is clearly to more and more years of education . But they do hold the promise of flexibility , of ending the killing automatic jump in costs each year that outrages taxpayers , and of giving us all an enormous amount more in results for our money . The sooner this dawns on citizens in their role of taxpayers , the sooner will we rid ourselves of the classroom . ? The ideal teacher for a self-contained classroom of , for example , sixth-grade children , would be possessed of an impossible combination of virtues . She would ... have a masterly understanding of the learning process . . . be capable of effective communication with children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She should command a scholarly knowledge of mathematics , literature , history , science , geography , government , music , and art .... Ideally she will have insights , professional knowledge , and skills of a clinical psychologist ... cooperate effectively with a wide variety of parents ... be something of a public-relations expert ... and be a leader in community affairs " . // We have discussed some of the reasons why we should , with something faster than " all deliberate speed , " abolish the class . We should also , I submit , and with perhaps greater haste , abolish the classroom teacher . I am not suggesting , of course , that the good ladies and gentlemen be liquidated in the best fascist or communist manner , nor even that they be dismissed . I am merely tendering the idea that in all our broad land it is hard to find any common job more ridiculous in its conception than the impossible assignment we matter-of-factly give our elementary public school teachers . That of the high school teacher differs in some respects and is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , but it shares many of the same basic contradictions and staggering demands . The average parent and citizen , it seems safe to observe , has only a vague notion of what is , in theory at least , asked of today 's teacher . For half a century the classroom teacher 's job has been incessantly added to and complicated , with many of the new demands calling for an ever-increasing amount of 67 training and ever-rising levels of skills . Were an unsuspecting management expert asked to write a job description , his findings might well leave him shaken . And were the description to be taken literally , it is a fair guess that not one teacher in 100,000 could be declared qualified . Much of the criticism of our schools , when it involves the work of teachers , is unfair ? precisely because one can not give a person an impossible job and then demand performance . Even if all teaching salaries were to be doubled tomorrow , it would remain absurd to demand of each of thousands of rankand-file persons the vast combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher-in-training will be required on the job . Yet criticism is an essential tool for management and for democracy . One of the worst features of the present classroom system is that it makes fair , useful , and valid criticism exceedingly difficult . The first need , then , is to examine the job critically . We should make each teaching job one that can reasonably be done by the people available to do it , before we evaluate how well it is done . Consider the case of Miss L. , on a bright September morning , as for the first time she faces a roomful of thirty boys and girls , newly washed and starched for the occasion . They will be her charges until June , for the entire school year of about 180 days . Her assignment is roughly to interest , inspire , teach , guide , develop , discipline , and protect them , covering single-handedly a wide range of subjects , mostly in this one room . Miss L. happens to be twenty-four years old . She is a graduate of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " half year " of practice-teaching experience ( actually , a few weeks ) and a year on this job , and her other work experience consists of summer jobs in a department store and in a college office . With similar training and experience in retailing , or in office work , or in a hospital , she would be looked on tolerantly as a perhaps promising beginner , ready soon for her first promotion from the bottom of the ladder to the lowest rung . But our schools , as we have begun to see , operate on weird and unique principles which ignore almost all we know and apply as sound sense and good personnel practice everywhere else . In our // schools there is no ladder . Miss L. is a teacher . Miss R. , who has ten years experience in three schools , is a teacher . Mrs. Q , who has had fifteen years experience and is regarded as an authority on several aspects of her work , is a teacher . Like the best and most accomplished teacher in her school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get , and she had it from the first day she faced her first class in this institution ! So far as teaching goes , she began at the top ? a circumstance that may prove a little trying for her hapless class , even though Miss L. is ( as not all youthful teachers are ) eager , conscientious , and a cut or two above average in intelligence and ability . If Miss L. should have a ruminative moment or two on this busy day , she may reflect on her chances for advancement . In store or office , and in many other occupations , she could feel some confidence that outstanding effort , skill , aptitude , and abilities will , with reasonable luck , carry her upward over the years . But so far as teaching is concerned , none of these will avail her much here . She can look forward to more pay and status : ? By growing older , since pay scales go up for years of service , almost regardless of performance . ? By going back to college and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such courses actually improve her teaching . ? By becoming a head of department , assistant principal , or principal , giving up teaching to the required extent . ? By shifting from elementary to high school teaching , if this happens to be one of the few systems in which there remains a salary differential , thereby waiving much of her experience . ? By moving to another school system with a higher pay scale . n general , these are the only ways Miss L. can progress , in all but a handful of school systems ! If we were to try to devise a system better designed to attract and harbor mediocrity , to repel and discourage the more able and devoted , we would be hard put to surpass this . Absurd Assignment 69 But even more astonishing is the devastating fact that not only will Miss L. not be rewarded for exceptional teaching , but by and large no one will ever objectively know or much care how effective a teacher Miss L. becomes ! I realize this statement may sound wildly exaggerated , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard it as quite accurate . ( The skeptical reader is urged to have a quiet , off-the-record talk with administrators in his own system . ) During the initial years , of course , before Miss L. has tenure or a continuing contract , there will be some degree of official concern about her competence . But today , it is highly likely to be an " in or out " concern ? can she handle her classes or ca n't she ? ? rather than much of an attempt to measure her proficiency . If she is unable to control her classes , seeks help incessantly , ca n't conform to the school 's operations , gives rise to too many parent or student complaints , makes a total mess of her records , shows marked emotional instability , is too frequently absent , or hopelessly antagonizes the rest of the staff , she may be dropped or transferred . Otherwise , she will be " in " ? and the longer she remains in , the more impractical it becomes , as a rule , to attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Administering the People 's Schools : " It is difficult to clear a district of weak teachers ; this , in itself , makes it important to hire good ones in the first place . " In large city systems , tenure is the rule . In smaller systems , the contract in some form is usually found . The smaller the community , the more will failure to rehire a teacher stir up a hornets ' nest for the administration should the teacher have local friends and family . If the teacher can be tolerated , the powers that be are not likely to go looking for trouble . And with the teacher shortage what it has been , and promising to become far worse , most school systems are becoming progressively less fussy . ... Superintendents have found themselves in the embarrassing position of having to accept every qualified applicant for a position . Consequently , teacher selection practices have tended to become almost wholly controlled by the central administrative offices . In many systems the // principal does not meet the new teachers . . . until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While this condition is lamentable , it is in many instances understandable . The quotation is from Educational Leadership and the Elementary School Principal , by Spain , Drummond , and Goodlad , published in 1956 . In common with a number of other more recent books on school administration , it is admirably if frighteningly realistic . Agreement among the authorities is high . With classes to cover and schools to keep running regardless of high ideals and fine theories , working administrators seem to have few illusions . Even the reference to qualified applicants needs further comment : Let 's be candid about the way teachers are selected . In some small school systems , when a position is open , teachers apply and are selected according to the whims of members of the board of education or of the superintendent of schools . In many large systems , the candidate must pass a paper-and-pencil test at a certain percentile level and must meet the personality requirements of a personnel interviewer . Of course , candidates in both systems must meet the basic requirements of certification for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roughest matching of qualifications and job requirements is overlooked . The author quoted is Kimball Wiles , in the 1967 edition of Supervision for Better Schools . In many systems today , of course , " an emergency exists " frequently or routinely . Even in those favored communities where conditions are relatively milder , and the principal can still maintain at least the ceremony of interviewing new teachers before they begin work in his school , his freedom of action probably is severely circumscribed . In practice he can object to a teacher only on blatant grounds , or request an alternative on the plea that his locale requires a person different in some way , such as one who can teach woodwinds on the side , coach basketball , speak Spanish , or demonstrate that the school is perfectly willing to hire Negroes. // As any personnel officer will testify , hiring people is a chancy business at best . But most employees work where they can be readily observed . Teachers work in classrooms , behind closed doors . And authorities agree overwhelmingly that there is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intelligence and college records are not reliable indicators . Oftentimes , then , if a genuine choice is made between two candidates , it may be on the basis of which promises to get along better with the principal and his staff . The consideration is important , but not necessarily related to teaching ability . The plain fact is that the principal , after he has a new teacher on the job , has almost no objective way of measuring her performance against that of any other teacher , unless one or both are obviously incompetent or impossible . How is he to tell ? He can , of course , go into her classroom and observe her at work . He can see how she gives instruction , how she handles questions from the pupils . He can ask about various students and see how much she knows about them as individuals . From all this he can gain an impression , possibly even a fairly expert impression , if he himself is skilled and experienced and if he visits the classroom often enough . But the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging other persons , nor does he usually have time for many visits . Even more important is that the moment he enters a classroom , the normal situation in the classroom ceases to exist . Both children and teacher are on special behavior until he leaves . If the teacher has serious faults or inadequacies , they may well be , in today 's complicated , subtle classroom situation , exceedingly difficult to detect in a brief visit . Much of a teacher 's best work can not be judged save by careful and perceptive observation over a long period . Of this the principal or supervisor is well aware if he is truly competent to judge . Walk down the corridor of a school while it is in session , and the most baffling aspect of this entire system is strikingly evident . What is going on behind those closed doors ? There is almost no way of knowing , and , not surprisingly under today 's conditions , almost no attempt is being made to find out . Naively , parents often assume that teachers are closely // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal . Rarely is this the case . Today , a school is usually a collection of rooms in which individual teachers conduct their classes just about as they please . The beginning teacher who might like more supervision and help often finds it unavailable , while the more experienced teacher is likely to bridle at any more than a nominal effort of the principal or other official to supervise her , particularly if they try to " tell her what to do . " In The Teacher and School Organization , published in 1962 , authors Leo Chamberlain and Leslie Kindred summarize : In the majority of schools the quality of supervision given by principals and superintendents is exceedingly poor . ... It is difficult or next to impossible for the taxpayer and school patron to detect the failure in supervisory work . In The Necessary Revolution in American Education by Francis Keppel , recently U.S. Commissioner of Education , appears this conclusion : ... To put it bluntly , teachers in American classrooms have received appallingly little direction or supervision . The ancient and honorable tradition of each teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the days of the necessary revolution . A great many teachers are not visited for supervisory purposes for years at a stretch . The new teacher in the school and the beginning teacher in better schools may be visited a few times to see that they are " getting on all right , " and others may be visited for special reasons not concerned with evaluation . Beyond that there is very little . The literature on administration , and I have already pointed out that it tends to be frank , is quite unanimous on the topic . It agrees that evaluation of the teacher 's work is a thorny and still largely unsolved problem , and that if any sort of plan is to be tried , it should be one that first is accepted by the teachers involved . It is not too astonishing that teachers in classroom schools show little enthusiasm for the whole idea of merit ratAbsurd // ings , and schools that pay more for superior work in teaching are few and far between . The standard attitude is neatly put in Educational Leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good elementary school principal will function in this area of responsibility evaluation , as in all others , in conformity with principles of democratic leadership . If he does , the focus of his attention and energies will be directed not to past behavior , as rating scales are , but rather to creating situations which will produce more desirable behavior on the part of all teachers in the present and the fixture . Involving teachers , pupils , and parents in total-school evaluation seems to be a more fruitful way of stimulating individual teacher effectiveness than passing judgment occasionally on the teacher 's work . Acceptance of people as they are and working with them cooperatively to bring about growth are sound educational practice . ( Italics are my emphasis . ) The reader familiar with the realities of our public schools will likely find this statement honest , sound , and unexciting . Others more likely will find , their hair beginning to curl . For here is a wide window looking in upon a vital area of the nevernever land of public education . In every other activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons or atomic submarines , we take it for granted that we obtain high effectiveness only if we constantly check on results , only if we move the able people ahead and reward them , and shift or cull out those who ca n't handle their assignments on the desired levels . One tries to picture a plant foreman saying of an employee who repeatedly ruins work , " One must accept people as they are ! " Or a stockbroker , musing on the costly carelessness of a junior and observing , " We must try to bring about growth . " The authors quoted above make sense , however , because there are two great differences in the situations . The foreman and the stockbroker have ample opportunity to observe , and to some degree measure , the effectiveness of their people ; and they can lire , demote , reassign , or otherwise deal with their less satisfactory employees and show appreciation in practical ways of // those who are superior . The school official ca n't . He is bound by a rigid salary scale that ignores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is stuck with his teachers . Under those circumstances , " acceptance of people as they are " is far from stupid , since there is little other choice . Those of us who do not have to work under such basically impossible circumstances should not pounce too impolitely on the term " democratic leadership , " all too obviously a euphemism for plain helplessness . If there is one honored principle underlying democratic leadership , it is that authority must be matched to responsibility . It is one more of our basic rules of organization that is observed everywhere but within our school systems . It begins to become clear , I trust , why we can venture to predict that no one will concern themselves very much with how effective our Miss L. becomes as a teacher . Since there is no way to punish or reward her , except by withdrawing her from teaching , why bother ? When a typical principal assures a parent that " Mrs. G. is one of our best teachers , " he does not mean that he knows she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of measuring her achievement with the pupils she is given . He means that Mrs. G. gets along all right with him , that her pupils do n't misbehave or fall behind exceptionally , and that parents of her students complain rather less than average . He may also mean that Mrs. G. conforms to the proper pattern of in-service growth by taking courses or otherwise engaging in activities which look good , however difficult it may be to prove that they result in better performance within the secret confines of her class . Principals can and do rate teachers for the guidance of the administration in appointing department chairman and other officials from the ranks of teachers . This power of recommendation is virtually the only control most principals have over their teachers , for power to control subordinates must ultimately rest on some authority or ability to penalize or reward them . But these recommendations often will not be based even on what the principal believes to be teaching effectiveness . Such jobs call for tact , popularity , ability to handle people , and both liking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture heavily : certain teachers may be ruled out of consideraAbsurd // tion at the start , regardless of their estimated teaching effectiveness . Thus the teacher who is not interested in taking this route , or who sees no great possibility of achieving such a promotion , or who plans to stop teaching , can cooperate with or ignore the principal as she chooses , up to ( and at times beyond ) open contempt and insubordination . It is remarkable , indeed , that some principals manage to hold the influence they do ; but even so , the typical principal in a good-size school may have to coax , wheedle , maneuver , flatter , and exercise the patience of a god over weeks to years to install the procedures and arrangements he wants . He can give orders , but he has little to enforce them with . Oddly , principals in the largest cities are often better off . They sometimes can arrange to have recalcitrants transferred to far-removed or less desirable schools ? a club that may command considerable respect , if the teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal has little knowledge of what goes on inside the classroom , it is seldom teaching that is at issue , but rather interpersonal relations or procedure . The attitude of some teachers was voiced succinctly by one vice-president of a teachers ' union : " An administrator , like the custodian or the heating engineer , is in the school only to make the job of the teacher easier . " The viewpoint , or at least the phrasing , is extreme . A more moderate statement is found in Improving Instruction Through Supervision by Thomas H. Briggs and Joseph Dustman , published in 1952 : There is no criticism more frequently expressed of administrative officers than that they do not know or understand intimately the work of their subordinates . In consequence of this attitude teachers are often skeptical of the value of suggestions made to them by a principal who is attempting supervision . Note the word " attempting " ! But ironically , the mint-new and often very insecure teacher who would eagerly welcome advice , orientation , information , and supervision commonly finds such help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her probably skimpy practice sessions had help present or close by , now finds that the same four walls that imprison her // and her charges also shut out assistance . On most jobs , a beginner can learn rapidly by watching others and by the friendly help of experienced workers with whom there is frequent contact . Team teaching provides this normal situation , but the classroom tosses the tyro into deep water alone , to sink or swim . Even in well-staffed schools , pressures may not permit more than fleeting supervisory attention , especially early in the term . Suddenly and acutely aware of the inadequacy of her preparation , the teacher survives if she can ? often embittered toward supervision . By and large , it seems safe to say that " democratic leadership " discussed above reflects the most common teacher attitude , and the usual practice . Let the principal lead , gently ; the teachers will follow , if they feel like it . With , then , some idea of the autocratic , unsupervised power over a large class of young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , let us see what she is assigned to do . If we seem to be already deep in absurdity , we are about to plunge much deeper . We can say that Miss L. teaches a class of thirty-odd children of a certain grade in a certain school : this will identify her for public and payroll purposes . If we want to know what she actually does , we have to consider and list in conventional terms each function she normally carries out in the course of the ordinary day and week . These include : ( a ) Teaching , the prime function . It is helpful to divide it into " primary " teaching ? presenting ideas and information , demonstrating , explaining , clarifying , awakening and maintaining interest ; and " follow-up " teaching , which carries through the same process to each individual student ? hopefully , to obtain the desired learning . ( b ) Drilling and practice ? developing skills and firm knowledge through repetition and exercises . ( c ) Guidance ? helping each child to develop as a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and abilities . ( d ) Evaluating ? checking on the child 's progress in learnAbsurd // ing and personal growth , through examinations , observation , recitations , homework ; and reporting it to the school and to the parents . ( e ) Discipline ? maintaining order , obtaining compliance and performance of work required ; handling behavior problems , rewarding , and punishing . ( f ) Clerical ? keeping attendance and other administrative or teaching records . ( g ) Housekeeping ? maintaining the classroom in good order . ( h ) Custodian ? controlling , issuing , and recovering books , supplies , instruments , equipment , exhibits . ( i ) Shepherding ? taking the class from place to place ; recess , bus , lunchroom , traffic , and study hall duties . ( j ) Money handling ? controlling " milk money , " savings , and other funds for various purposes . This is , of course , a simplified list , covering only those duties which relate directly to the class as a whole . The teacher is also supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is expected to take an active part in faculty matters , which may involve assisting with administration , or helping to solve curriculum , teaching , disciplinary , and other problems . The textbooks invariably advise her to be active in the community to show her interest and demonstrate her good citizenship . Also , she must " grow " in service , by taking courses , attending workshops and conferences , or otherwise . Since some problems with students can be approached only on an individual basis , she should be prepared and equipped for such interviews . She should be equally equipped to deal with parents , whether interested , reasonable , and cooperative , or angry , anxious , and disinterested ; and she is admonished never to forget the vital importance of building good public relations with the parents and the taxpayers who support the schools . She is expected to show imagination and ingenuity in devising her own teaching materials and methods , and in arranging special events such as trips , plays , or exhibitions , as well as pal t ies and celebrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher to do ! But in addition to these // duties , we add a staggering load of responsibility . Both by law and by custom , the teacher stands " in the role of the parents " while each child is in her care . She is responsible for his physical and emotional well-being ; she must protect him from accidents ; know where he is at all times ; guard him against older or bigger children , toughs , and intruders ; observe his health and take steps if he appears ill ; keep an eye on his property ; and if he is younger , " mother " him , help him on with his overshoes , and instruct and assist him in the more elementary forms of sanitation . The teacher 's job still looks much like the same job in , say , 1910 , because there is still the same class and classroom organization . But the job itself has changed vastly . Almost year by year it has become more demanding , more difficult to discharge , as emphasis has shifted from running an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " approach . In bygone days the course of instruction was spelled out in detail , grade by grade . Children were , in broad , put through the mill ? they passed or failed . Those children who had little taste or aptitude for learning dropped out as early as possible , with few going as far as high school and far fewer to college . Far less was taught , and probably less effectively , than is attempted today . School systems in general were highly organized and rigidly controlled ; this was the heyday of the superintendent and the mighty-whiskered principal whose frown caused teachers to tremble . They were told what to teach and they taught it , as the students were told what to learn and , largely by rote and repetition , learned it . We must suspect that children then differed as greatly in aptitudes , abilities , and backgrounds as they do today . But the schools found the idea awkward . Children were taught as if they were alike , so far as the teacher could manage . If matters did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint today , it was because the schools were attempting a great deal less . An " elementary " education was just that ; and the emphasis was on what was taught and what was remembered , rather than on what happened to the child . For a far simpler and less frenetic age than ours , the basic public // education was much less inadequate than it would be today . Even though the progressive education movement is now dead and scarcely an issue , the changes that have taken place in the accepted view of what constitutes adequate public education is ample testimony to the potency of the ideas that William Kilpatrick and John Dewey and others put forward ? and that some distorted or carried to absurd lengths . If parents today often have trouble understanding the schools , and older citizens especially carp , it is probably because this vast shift in purpose and content is only vaguely understood . Educators are in very good agreement , overall , that the development of each child is fully as important as what he learns : they bemoan the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fattened in France . The premise is that each child is different , that he must develop at his own speed in each skill , and that his background , interests , needs , and potential all are unique to him . It is a premise that in the light of present-day knowledge is hard to argue with . But obviously it makes the teacher 's job enormously more complicated : it is much easier to teach one class by the book than to teach thirty-odd individual children by one 's own resources . Thus the level of skill asked of the teacher today is astronomically higher . In addition , the school knows today that each child that enters kindergarten must be carried through to high school , not to be set on his own until the legal release age of 16 or 17 has been obtained , no matter whether he be a potential Ph.D . or be barely well enough endowed mentally to go to school at all . The requirement makes it all the more impossible to demand of a group of children that they all learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more is taught today , the assumption is that learning and development of the child as a person and personality must go hand in hand . For a while , as progressivism ran wild , there seemed to be a number of authorities who apparently believed that so long as the child was happy in school it did not matter whether he learned anything at all , or how much effort went into how little learning ; but the pendulum has swung back to more reasonable proportions of effort . Aside from the most hard-bitten reac80 THE CLASSROOM DISASTER tionaries , who survive in small numbers in almost any community , it is rare to find serious critics of the broad base on which our schools operate in this regard . But though our schools today have radically different purpose and objective and a sharply different function from that of half a century ago , they still try to make use of the identical organization ? classes , classrooms , grades , classroom teachers ! Because the change in the teacher 's job has been steady and gradual , the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is even physically true ? the " egg-crate " design of schools has played no small part in preserving the class by providing classrooms suitable only for a class system . It is apparent , I believe , that we ask a teacher to teach a class the way we once asked a shoemaker to make a pair of boots ? doing every phase of the work himself , and by hand . If we still made shoes that way , a pair would cost from $60 up ; and since it would be impossible to find enough persons with this combination of skills , most of us would go barefoot even if we could provide public funds to assist purchase . The situation in our schools is closely parallel , except that the skills needed are in many instances much higher than the shoemaker 's . The organizational plan is pre-Industrial Revolution . We make shoes cheaply , plentifully and of excellent quality ( and in vast variety ! ) by applying the twin principles of division of labor and use of technology , two of the cornerstones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools we can find heating " engineers " who would not dream of mowing the grass , and grounds keepers who would become indignant at being asked to tend the furnace ; but in our classrooms our teachers still essay the role of forty-armed goddesses . Nor have the teachers , apparently , fully realized how ridiculous it is for them to insist , on any possible occasion , that they are " professional " persons , entitled to the status and pay of professionals . A skeptical but not unfriendly public observes that teachers do n't behave like professionals . If a dentist used his time and skills as do teachers , he would spend part of his time working with patients , another part making // out his bills and licking the envelopes , and still other hours cleaning up his office and equipment , and possibly washing the windows . He might be a very good dentist , but his community could hardly help wonder why he did not hire people to do the work that scarcely required his specialized talents and years of training . An architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detail drawings and prepare the blueprints , and then carry them personally to each contractor . In modern life , a professional person is one with a high skill based on theoretical understanding which he utilizes to the full . He does not willingly or cheerfully do work that can be done by persons of lower skill , nor does he expect to be paid for his high skill when he is doing work that could be done as well or better by an assistant , clerk , aide , handyman , or messenger boy . What is the proper pay for a teacher who is supervising a lunchroom to maintain order ? What is a good salary for a teacher while she is correcting spelling or arithmetic papers , which the brightest children in her class could do as well , and give her the results to review ? How professional is counting out pieces of red , yellow , and blue chalk , and then counting them back into the box so it wo n't be necessary to requisition more ? It is both amusing and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organization we have tolerated for so many years in our schools . We would have to divide the patients into " classes , " and then put a doctor in charge of each class . The doctor would now have to do everything for his patients , from surgery through prescribing and administering medication , down to giving alcohol rubs and taking temperatures . How good would the care be and how much could we expect such doctors to be paid ? Where would we find enough who combined in one person all the skills required ? In the context of medicine , it seems blindingly clear that we ca n't expect to have more than a few extremely skilled and able persons in each professional field , and that we must let these persons specialize and be able to distribute their talents widely . We must also arrange to pay them highly . And we must // provide other persons , at several levels of descending skill , to divide the work and perform it so that skills and the money to pay for skills are used most efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally obvious , as soon as we rid ourselves of the overage and overripe idea that children must be held in rigid class groups , in separate rooms . If we consider the list of teacher functions given above and put them in new order according to the skills involved we come out with a list something like this : Even as I set down this division , I can hear the familiar anguished cry of teachers , raised whenever their accustomed ways are threatened with disturbance , " But you do n't understand ! " Most all of these activities , they will assure me , are part of the process of education . Counting back the crayons is more than a nuisance routine ? it teaches the necessity of order , of cleaning up after a job , of regard for property . Collecting milk-money provides opportunity for teaching the value and use of money , and some arithmetic to boot . Such // arguments , I submit , are besides the point . Since experience and learning are impossible to separate , it can easily be claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way . The question , however , is how skilled a person is required to carry on this function , if it indeed has sufficient value to be worthwhile . We can hardly deny that the regular taking of temperatures in a hospital is an important function , but we do n't have to take a doctor from other duties to do it . No business can survive if the mail is n't handled promptly and correctly , but we would be astonished to find an executive sorting or weighing in the mail room . It seems evident that teachers must come to think in these terms . It is utterly unrealistic , I believe , for them to yearn for more professional status , more respect from the public , and more adequate pay , as long as they spend substantial parts of their working hours doing menial , trivial , and unskilled work . While teachers , like most other people , hate to change their habits of work and thought , it is hard to see how they can lose in any way by change that forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore become able to claim and obtain corresponding status and compensat ion . Equally necessary , it seems obvious , is some form of " promotion ladder " up which teachers can move to highest skill assignments and greater responsibilities within teaching . So long as we give the title " teacher " to a raw recruit with a few weeks of experience at most , and give her the same responsibilities ? charge of a class ? as the best skilled and experienced , we make any claim to professionalism rather absurd . We nee to provide a progression , such as apprentice , assistant , teacher , senior teacher , master teacher , with salaries to match , that can reflect ability , achievement , and experience beyond simple timeserving . The classroom makes such a ladder all but impossible . Team teaching and " open school " approaches make it entirely feasible . In addition , they attract the able , ambitious , and careerminded person ( especially the male ) who so often is repelled by poor promotion prospects and the dismal isolation of the class100111. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , the statement issued contained these con-clusions : The American public must be reawakened to the fact that teachers work with our most precious resource ? our children . A good educational system requires good teachers and enough of them in each locality to meet its needs . We believe that , to increase the supply of good teachers from any source , three basic considerations must be kept in mind : ( 1 ) The prestige and status of teaching must be comparable to other professions within the community ; ( 2 ) The salary structure must be high enough and flexible enough to compete effectively with other fields bidding for quality manpower ; ( 3 ) The teacher 's job must be so defined as to challenge and attract the interest of talented people . The sentiments are splendid ; but it is rather a pity that the language does not make more explicit that changes are required to bring about each of the three objectives . Wishing wo n't do it . Pointing dramatically to the importance of education wo n't do it . Making comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools and redefining the teacher 's job will do it . Since there is not enough money nor enough teachers now , and the shortages are getting worse rather than lessening , it seems inevitable that these changes will come about . The sooner , the better ? not only for our children but for their teachers . ? To see what is wrong with American ( and foreign ) high schools ... all we need do is take a close look at what goes on in the classrooms day after day during a school year . The ineffaceable memory carried away by a serious observer who stays for more than the usual fleeting visit is the crashing boredom that afflicts both the teachers and the taught . ' 9 Harold J. Noah in Teachers College Record , May 1967. // I have broken down the list in the previous chapter into three sections , but this is purely arbitrary . The more we study the actual , specific teaching job , as it is being performed , the more evident it becomes that many jobs are being rolled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , would simply conclude that , in a modern management sense , she does not have a job at all , but merely a collection of assorted duties . If we wish to sort out these duties , as a preliminary to recombining them into a number of coherent separate jobs , we have to examine them in considerable detail . In the following attempt to do so , brief as it must be , we will get some idea of the tremendous complexity , the difficulties , the subtleties , and the frustrations involved in the classroom teacher 's present assignment , as well as the lack of research , facilities , help , and administrative support , which adds greatly to the already crushing burden . The imparting of knowledge and understanding , and the development of skills , is the key function of schools . That we now lay great stress on the development of each child as 87 a person and citizen does not alter that fact . But there are two quite different aspects of teaching , which I have referred to briefly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow-up . " Because the classroom teacher is charged with doing both , the distinction at present tends to be overlooked . ( It is further obscured by the gross assumption that teaching and learning are directly linked , and that the child learns what the teacher intends him to learn . The most casual check on this assumption reveals it to be contrary to reality ? in Part II this question will be examined in some depth . ) " Primary " teaching can best be thought of as the kind that stimulates the student and arouses interest and desire to learn , or that opens doors and invites him to enter new intellectual or skill areas . " Follow-up " teaching provides the student the content , explanation , guidance , coaching , and encouragement that helps him convert the aroused interest into organized learning . The primary function of arousing interest and desire to learn clearly calls for both knowledge of subject and a certain type of personality ? pretty much that which often characterizes the successful lecturer . We can hardly expect a teacher who has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no flair for presentation , to inspire her group with a burning desire to learn algebra . Primary teaching calls tin " spark . " The person who has that precious quality usually does best with groups , especially large groups . The follow-up function necessarily calls for ability to be sensitive to and relate to the individual student , in a patient , sympathetic , and quiet way that lessens the student 's anxiety and facilitates identification of learning blocks or failures . Quite obviously very few teachers can be expected to combine these opposite attributes . They tend to conduct their classes in ways that reflect their personalities ? whether this makes for desirable instruction or not . In Teaching in High School , by Hubert H. Mills and Hari R. Douglass , we find this observation on high school teachers , whom we might expect to have an edge over elementary school teachers in this " primary " ability : // It is unquestionably true that high school teachers , especially beginning teachers , are not good lecturers . Development of skill and effectiveness in explaining , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Probably the greatest limitations of high school teachers as lecturers are ( 1 ) failure to take time to prepare lectures carefully . . . ( 2 ) lack of skill . . . ( 3 ) the lack of background in the subjects , in life experience , and in ability to correlate and organize materials from sources other than a few textbooks or college courses . As a result of these weaknesses and underdeveloped abilities , teachers are prone to take refuge in lesson-hearing and oral testing in the class period . It is only natural that the teacher who is unimpressed with his own talents as a lecturer and whose students seem to verify his opinion with yawns and restlessness feels impelled to turn to other methods . Since he is the sole arbiter of how he is to teach , there is little to pressure him into becoming expert through practice , even assuming he has the native ability to become expert . Just so , the teacher who is an excellent lecturer may rely too heavily on this method , and try to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since it is hard enough to find persons with one highlydeveloped skill , it seems sensible to divide these two teaching functions if possible , rather than try to staff each classroom with teachers possessing these two conflicting abilities . And without worrying about such essentially meaningless questions as the " importance " of the two functions , since both are needed , we can see that the fine lecturer is much harder to find or train than the follow-up teacher . He is also likely to possess personality attributes that make him more valuable in the labor marketplace outside of public schools . Such persons can hardly be expected to take jobs in schools in large numbers , or to stay at such work , if their greatest talent is muffled by their being locked into a single classroom , and assigned routine work that forbids its use . Thus the concept of the " master teacher " has come into // considerable popularity in the more adventurous educational circles , although it is still rather hard to come upon one in the flesh . Definitions will vary some ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flair for arousing and holding the interest of students , for inspiring them to seek learning in a particular direction because of this interest , and for getting ideas across to them with the proverbial blinding flash of insight that betokens true understanding . In a word , this is what we perhaps mistakenly call " the born teacher . " Almost every reader will recall such a person from his own educational career . When I attended university , 1 jumped at the chance to take a course given by perhaps the world 's greatest authority in the field . It proved to be a mistake . The learned gentleman was elderly , lacking in energy , and bored with his task . He read his lectures , and since he had a thick foreign accent and a partial speech obstruction , one did well to understand one sentence in three . In any case , it was faster and easier to read his book , which included precisely the same material . I am afraid many of us did just that during his lectures . Enthusiasm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course with an unrenowned English instructor whose subject was Shakespeare . He appeared to be a frustrated actor : he used a towering frame , an expressive mien , and a rotund voice until his eyes bugged and the floor and walls shook . But his enthusiasm , energy , love of subject , and ability to communicate his feelings made him in the eyes of marry students a master teacher . They took Shakespeare for credits and ended up enjoying every moment as a dead poet became very much alive . These Instances are extremes , to be sure . But the master teacher must love his subject , rather than teach it as duty . he must know his subject in depth , however elementary the level at which he teaches it . He must have that mystic ability to hold an audience , to explain with exceptional and dramatic clarity , and to invest what seems to be the dullest assignment with vitality and interest . Such persons are not rare , but they are not common . It follows that when we find one , nothing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful // of students . Master teachers should teach as many children as possible . Fortunately , this type of person usually works much better with a large audience than with a small one . And fortunately too , modern technical resources make it simple and practical to provide the large one . Once we make such a division of labor , and recognize the skill we are trying to hire , it follows that we want to see this person be truly a professional , by providing for undiluted use of his highest skill , and by providing all the conditions and aids for its use to the greatest advantage . The classroom teacher , as we have seen , has a laundrylist of assorted duties . To expect her to devote hours to preparation of a single lecture-style period , to gather and check material for it , to assemble aids and props or have them made , to round up and prepare assistants or guests , is to ask the impossible . If a teacher makes even a portion of this effort once in a while , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher , such preparation could be routine , a normal part of his or her job . Free of classes to cover , his time would be devoted partly to preparation , partly to delivery , and partly to working directly with various students and teachers to get feedback , learning how well his ideas had got across and what gaps need to be filled . Consider the contrast . On one hand we may have , in a city , two hundred third-grade teachers duplicating effort , each explaining a fundamental operation in arithmetic . Even if we assume all are " qualified " by current standards , it would be remarkable if as many as one in six had any deep love and understanding of mathematics . It would be even more remarkable if one in twenty had a great flair for clarifying and creating interest in mathematics . So in most of the classes the lesson will be taught because it is called for by the book and the plan . In many classes it will be taught , if dully , at least diligently ; but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher dislikes or feels ill at ease in the subject , it will be taught badly , with aversion and lack of confidence that the pupils readily sense . For many students , a school year with such a teacher is often enough to kill their interest in the disliked subject for good . // On the other hand , picture the master teacher at work on the same assignment . He loves mathematics ? he conveys his excitement with his first words . His knowledge is both broad and deep . He is experienced and he is a specialist ; he has explained mathematics perhaps a hundred times more often than the average classroom teacher , constantly improving his methods and techniques . And he has the energy , the vigor , the personality , the combination of resources and skills that brings the subject alive , suffuses the simplest aspects of it with new meaning , relates it to the children 's lives and interests ? even while he is not afraid to treat it as an intellectual adventure , too . He is seeking not only to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least some students to want to know more , to seek it . And since he gives this same presentation many times , to many children , he can afford to have all the props and aids he needs . Does he wish to make reference to the pyramids of Egypt ? A signal , and the picture is on the screen . Does he want to dramatize fractions by dividing a pie ? Here 's an actual pie . Does he want a few minutes of animated film to illustrate a point ? Another signal , and the film rolls . Can we compare the two levels of teaching ? Will it surprise us if the master teacher in one hour gets across , unforgettably , basic ideas that the classroom teacher in many cases could not make as clear and vivid in ten , and in some cases not ever ? In sports , in carpentry , in bookkeeping , in writing , in art , in executive work , in any field we wish to name , the difference between the " real pro " and the modestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise us to find the rule any less binding in teaching . The reader will not , I hope , jump to the conclusion that the school of the future is seen as one in which experts lecture one after another , to great applause , while the humble follow-up teachers hunt moments in which to do their work in dark corners . How the use of " presenter " specialists fits into possible new structures am primarily seeking to illustrate the principle of separating out high skills needed in teaching . Persons who have them must be identified , and given the special preparation , training , and experience which will // bring them to their peak usefulness . Then they must be allowed to specialize and bring their skills and talents to many pupils , not just one class . Just as " highly skilled doctor " may mean a brain surgeon , anesthetist , internist , otolaryngologist , general practitioner , or pathologist , so " highly skilled teacher " may come to have a variety of meanings in parallel fashion . In the pamphlet " Images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " teacher specialists " and describes their work in these words : These specialists will teach subject matter for which they are particularly well qualified , usually to relatively large groups of students . At times they will serve as consultants to individuals and groups of students working in and outside the school and will assist with extraclass activities . Most of these teachers will be specialists in the use of such teaching aids as television , tape recordings , projectors , students ' self-appraisal devices , and the like , although some may be particularly effective in working with smaller groups of students . Other educators who see great advantages in the master teacher idea ( the proposal in contemporary terms goes back at least as far as 1947 ) offer varying descriptions , but the basic approaches are in close agreement . How much should the master teacher be paid ? The usual view is , a lot more than the present classroom teacher : perhaps $10,000 to $12,000 to start in most systems , and up to $18,000 in the best-paying . For persons of high professional skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , such levels are hardly exorbitant . They appear necessary not only to attract the most able persons , but to give " pure " public school teaching what it has long lacked ? both a financial and professional base for respect . By definition , we can never expect to have a great number of master teachers . But even a few in each school system will establish a top for a " ladder " up which persons interested in teaching , not administration , can climb . The ordinary person seeking a job asks , " How much does it pay ? " The abler candidate asks instead , " How high can I go on // ability ? " If the answer is discouraging , he seeks other work . But while the proposed pay for master teachers may at first blush seem high , we should not think of it as necessarily being expensive . With modernized organization and improved use of personnel , any school may well be able to pay such top salaries without necessarily wrecking the normal budget . For , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject for the time being , there is another point worth noting . It is no secret to our children that teachers are neither very highly regarded in society , nor well paid . As the brighter children grow older , they perceive quite clearly that not all teachers have first-class intellects , nor training , nor abilities . How much of our often-lamented national disrespect for intellectual pursuits , for scholarship , for bookish and abstract work , has its beginnings right here ? For teachers personify such work and the people who engage in it , so far as most children have opportunity to see . It seems safe to assume that it will do no harm to have students discover , through master teachers , that at least some teachers are outstanding personalities , deeply rooted in their fields , highly talented , honored in their calling and in the community , and paid at least enough to give them some income tax worries . Without belittling the importance of keeping Johnny 's feet dry , we can note that no parent will ever telephone a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office . ? Step by step , making their problems more complicated all the time , the children ? not all of them , but a good many ? worked out for themselves most of the rules for doing addition . In a week ? working only a few minutes a day ? they covered material that the school was prepared to spend years teaching them . 5 , John Holt in How Children Learn THE TEACHING FUNCTION However skilled the master teacher may be , it is apparent that his job is primarily to start the ball rolling . It is an axiom of education in modern terms that no great amount of learning ever takes place until interest has been aroused ; the amount of learning is likely to reflect directly the amount of interest . The master teacher 's first duty , then , is to arouse interest in the particular unit of study he takes up . He must also use his special resources as a teacher to get across the key thought , the flash of insight that becomes the root from which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher may lecture on the rainfall cycle , showing how water is evaporated , forms into clouds , is precipitated as rain . To many of his young hearers the whole concept may be brand new : they have seen lakes and rivers ( or perhaps they have n't ! ) and rain and clouds , but accepted them as simply " there , " without any thought of process or cycle . The master teacher , if successful , makes them see the familiar with new insight , gives a section of their world new meaning . Such an experience is thrilling to most children . Having torn off part 97 of the veil , they have no desire to stop . They want to know more , to consolidate and display and talk about their new understanding . The stage is set for follow-up teaching . In the table on page 82 I have put this under " medium " skills . Let me point out again that we are not now concerned with " importance , " since all essential parts of a function are important , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about which we can argue forever . We are considering the matter of skill , and how to use personnel most wisely and efficiently in this light . If we ponder the question , we come to see , I think , that by " high skill " we invariably mean " rare skill . " Most of us manage to develop remarkable skill in balancing a long , thin body on two small extremities , on which we contrive to stand , walk , run , dance , jump , and traverse irregular surfaces . Might not a seal view this as harder than balancing a ball on one 's nose ? Yet we do not , that I am aware , commonly think of our ability to stay erect as a high skill . Our civilization ordinarily pays persons possessing useful rare skills pretty much according to their rarity . Since we can find many more persons who can develop passable or better skill at follow-up teaching than we can find master teachers , it follows that we must define this work as requiring medium skill . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare degrees of skill in methodology or follow-up teaching . Such persons might very well be made master teachers , specializing in using these skills . On the whole , though , follow-up teaching does not require exceptional skills . Our Miss L. , having patience and a friendly approach , plus training and experience that may improve year by year , can do rather well , especially if she is able to start with the learning readiness of her students at a high level , in terms of aroused interest at least . Miss L. knows how to ramify this interest into many areas , in which practice in a variety of basic skills will necessarily be involved . She may pose a science question : what experiments can the students devise to test whether water does indeed evaporate ? Or a geographical question that calls into use library skills : what bodies of water are especially salty , what are they like , and what part does evaporation play ? // She can form a team to visit the local newspaper offices , consult their files , and report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that increases understanding of community resources and employs skill in verbal and written communication . In arithmetic , there can be a dozen problems : calculating average temperature for a month ; determining how much water would cover the playground to the depth of an inch ; designing and building a gauge to measure rainfall . Still another team might do studies on the economic consequences of rain or drought , perhaps interviewing residents in a variety of occupations . In all of this Miss L. 's skill in tying interest to projects and assignments and in guiding children into them on levels that allow each a good deal of successful achievement plays an essential role , as does her ability to find suitable projects , or invent her own , or let her students devise appropriate ones reflecting their aroused interest . We can begin to glimpse , I believe , how a seemingly rather rigid program for the master teachers could be tied in with a much more flexible follow-up by teachers at the level of Miss L. The programming of the master teacher presentations , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of the follow-up teachers . In addition , the master teacher will of necessity want to maintain direct contact with at least a sample number of students , to get the invaluable feedback that tells him how well he is getting his ideas through to the pupils and how he can further improve his presentation . Splitting the teaching job this way does not rob the follow-up teacher of freedom to adapt teaching to the needs of her particular group of the moment , nor to use the methods she prefers because she has the best success with them . For the younger students especially , it can bring the enormous advantage of frequent exposure to a number of inspiring teachers and personalities , even while working routinely with only a few . Making at least part of the master teachers ' program rigid has one vastly important advantage . It is a convenient and relatively sure way of seeing to it that the few dozen " grand " ideas on which a basic education rests are positively and expertly covered , as early as practicable in a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ways , to raise the index of understanding to the highest possible point . It is a " grand idea , " for example , that science does not accept anything on authority , but only on the ability of other scientists to reach the same conclusions from experiment or observation . The master teacher says water evaporates and condenses , but the students check his statement by devising and conducting experiments , because in introducing science the master teacher got across this fundamental idea and probably showed its startling effect on the course of civilization . ( In contrast , many so-called science courses in both elementary and high schools present as " experiments " what are simply demonstrations . The vital concept of an experiment as a " question to nature , " a verification or disproving of an hypothesis , is often totally lost sight of . Students whose records show years of " taking science " often , at least in my experience , seem unable to state with any assured confidence the simplest tenets of the scientific method . In one instance , a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unpredicted . The teacher , annoyed that this group was holding up the others , told them what they should have seen , and went on with the lesson ! None of the students felt any scientific outrage , so far as I could determine . ) Similarly , in English , a master teacher secure in his scholarship and enthusiasm can get across the vitally important " grand idea " that words are not fixed in meaning , arbitrary , and inanimate , but on the contrary alive , changing , often rich in historical accretions , and varying in meaning according to when , where , and by whom they are used . Another grand idea is that we can represent a large object by a small , diagramatic drawing ? a house by a plan , a state by a map . When for a time I taught map-reading in the Army , I was amazed at how many men , including some college trained , had never mastered this concept . In mathematics there are at least a half dozen such ideas . How many adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of zero ! And I am among those who reached voting age and more before ever realizing that " two times two is four " is an equation . // Under the pressure of many duties , a classroom teacher may fail to cover some of these grand ideas adequately , or even at all ; for usually it is quite possible to teach the subject matter so that it is " learned " ? enough to give " right answers " ? but not really understood . A child can become adept in doing arithmetic in the prescribed fashion without grasping the why of the process , for example . ( Ask him to do mental arithmetic , and his dependence on the mechanical pencil-and-paper approach may become strikingly visible . ) It is also customary for teachers to ask such a question as " what was the effect of the invention of the cotton gin upon the course of American slavery " in an examination , and deduct a few points if it is missed , even though missing it must raise the gravest doubts about the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a child may often be able to parrot back remembered material that is correct , without ever grasping its full meaning . If the teacher has had modern training , with its emphasis on mythical " readiness " and passively awaiting the " right moment , " she may all the more easily skip a basic area , or perhaps hurry over it because she is behind schedule according to her unit plan . In practice , there is no adequate check on her , nothing to force attention to the omission at the time . We can see the potential value of building the master teacher 's program around these essential grand ideas , covering each not once but a number of times , so there is certainty of each child ultimately grasping them . It can then become the responsibility of the master teacher in each area to see that the students do understand . The interplay between master teacher and follow-up teacher introduces a check-and-balance relationship benefiting both . There is much more to the process of teaching , however , than merely the area of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should like to offer here a simple and convenient division of the teaching-learning process into three stages . It is my own , I should perhaps explain , because the classroom teacher 's job is , as we have seen , so complicated an assignment that " authoritative " break-downs of the work , where they are ventured at all in recent texts , tend to run several pages . Nor // have I found any too useful for the purpose in hand : a division of the classroom teacher 's work primarily by level of skill required . The three stages are these : 1 . Presentation . This includes the arousing of interest , the ' 1Q conveying of information and the explanation of ideas . It is done to the student , who is passive . 2 . Repetation . I have taken the liberty of coining the word , to include all the work which is primarily for the purpose of practice and developing facility , and which is more or less repetitive in nature . It is more than mere repetition , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of tasks with a common theme or object , rather than rote . Learning the alphabet , a multiplication table , or pronunciation of foreign words by drill come under this head ; and so too do working an assortment of examples to master an algebraic process , learning the technique of playing the clarinet , or taking dictation to master shorthand . Repetation is done by the student , but usually at or under the direction of a teacher ? usually a back-and-forth relationship . 3 . Personalization . This is the step in which the student makes use of what he has learned , in or out of school , in a personal and original way , as by using mathematics to solve a problem in a model he is building ; writing a report on a project he has carried out ; or painting a mural based on study in history . Personalization takes place only if the student works to at least some extent on his own initiative , even if within the frame of a broad assignment . In the examples of imaginative follow-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are that teaching can be carried through to the final personalization stage , in which the student makes what he has learned actually his own . " What you know , you do n't have to remember . " But the repetation and personalization steps should not be confused as to purpose . Personalization , of necessity , involves practice ? one can not write a report without further exercise in spelling and // composition . But the exercise is not the purpose . Rather it is to find out , by the acid test of execution , how adequate the student 's understanding is ( from presentation ) , and how adequate his skills are ( from repetation ) , for the project in hand . He has tried to devise a scientific experiment to test an hypothesis ? does it do that , and can he set down , clearly organized and stated , what he proposes ? He has designed a rain gauge ? is it well conceived , is his arithmetic able to cope with the problems presented , can he make an understandable drawing ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask sensible questions , and report in writing or orally in good style ? Personalization tests , measures , proves what the student can do , at any point in his educational career . It does so not only for the school but for the student himself . He knows what he knows , and sees what he needs to know . He , not some other student ; not " the class . " The object of repetation , on the other hand , is to compress a lot of practice into a short time . At this point , I believe , we can see why very " progressive " methods , now largely in poor repute , brought so much criticism on the schools that used them . Teachers had the children set up a store so that they might learn arithmetic by making change and keeping accounts . Possibly the children enjoyed it , and if so their interest helped them learn ; but the amount of actual repetation accomplished in such periods tended to be reduced to perhaps a fifth of what might have been accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the avalanche of complaints about college freshmen who can not read fast and well , or write simple declarative English , and business recruits who ca n't spell or do routine arithmetic , are without basis . Most of these complaints , so far as I can gather , seem to center on precisely the lack of crisp accuracy that is a sign of inadequate repetation . One office manager plagued with personnel problems of this kind told me of the perhaps illustrative comment of a girl in his bookkeeping department . He had called attention to the sad fact that her work was in error about five percent of the time . " Why , " she responded , " that means that 95% of the time I 'm right ! That would be a very good mark in school . " // I am constantly astonished at how frequently , in discussion of schooling , one hears plain old-fashioned drill spoken of disparagingly , with the implication that students hate it and would writhe if subjected to it , when there is such abundant evidence to the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular and widespread than marching bands , which involve learning an instrument ( largely repetation ) and mastering intricate formations ( wholly repetation ) . Further , bands set great stress on striving for perfection ; and indeed , to " goof ' while on parade is a painfully embarrassing experience . In a great many , if not most , children 's activities repetation plays a great part . Girls engage endlessly in hopscotch , jacks , ball-bouncing , and rope-skipping to doggerel or counting . What father has not found himself arm-weary and hot long before his boy was willing to give up throwing a football or baseball ? A hoop and a basketball provide hours of entertainment . Almost as soon as a child is old enough to develop a recognizable skill , voluntary repetation to improve it becomes observable . Even in a stricter context , it is by no means exceptional to find a class hugely enjoying crisply paced , rhythmic drill in learning phrases and sentences of a foreign tongue , when led by a teacher with energy and a personable approach . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learner has understanding of what he is doing and its purpose and that he can see that benefit can accrue . It would probably be difficult to get a hand to drill its best if its members were convinced no audience would ever watch them perform . The same boys who eagerly practice baseball because they can see their skill improving , and know where it can be applied , will moan at calisthenics , which often seems to have no observable benefit or goal . What levels of skill are required for repetation , well planned and carried out with verve and vigor ? The answer , I am afraid , is not to be found in the textbooks , in part because repetation as such still does not seem to be a sharp concept , and also because the proper use of skills by division of labor is an approach as rare within our schools as it is common without . To some extent , we can make our own judgments . Clearly , it would seem , // the planning of repetation must take place at a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove best in practice should not be widely adopted , in each particular application ? why should each repetation-leader act as though the problem were being met for the first time ? By its very nature , repetation will often lend itself to considerable standardization , both as to goals and objectives , and methods to be used . That is not to suggest that the goals need be fixed , or that the door be closed to experiment in methods or use of alternative methods where there is good reason . Once reasonably standardized , it would seem possible that at least a good deal of repetation does not require the full time and attention of a highly-trained teacher . A student teacher , or an assistant teacher , ranking below the present classroom teacher level , might very well handle the job , under some supervision . In such case , a considerable saving in teaching cost may be attainable , for repetation makes very efficient use of teaching time to begin with . ( Lest I be accused and forthwith burned at the stake for the heresy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one main object of saving teacher time can be to use it for more small-group and individual teaching . ) We may also note here , for further discussion , that the nature of repetation suggests that some of it is capable of being done by teachers at one remove , that is , by some adaptation of technology . If " teaching machines " ( in the broadest sense ) have thus far aroused little interest and less enthusiasm among teachers , they have attracted a good deal more of both at higher and less hidebound levels , and a quite astonishing amount of technical and exploratory work is currently being done . Such machines , if economical enough , have one great advantage at the outset : they can be used by students individually , permitting them to advance at precisely their own speed . As we have pointed out , repetation demands constant evaluation of each child 's progress , if he is not to be hurried or bored to tears . In the process of personalization we can use few machines . What is required above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pupil , or a very small group of pupils similarly engaged , and the teacher . Any teacher will agree , I believe , that nothing stimulates and inspires a child so much as // the personal , genuine interest of a respected adult . " Gee , " says the junior high lad , " Mr. Petersen is interested in me ! He wants to see how I put my radio together ! " A child makes a sharp and quite correct distinction between interest in him as a member of a class , and interest in him . But for the ordinary classroom teacher to give such interest to each child is impossible . There are too many children , too many duties , too little time . There is not even a place for a personal session during school hours , as a rule ! By and large , there is only one reliable way for a child in our class-ridden schools to get personal attention in private , and that is to get into more than average trouble . Somehow we have to reorganize our use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , routinized part of aching . We need to provide the small rooms in which teacher d students , not more than six at most , may meet . The actual number of minutes spent with each child need not , I suspect , be great ? a few minutes to discuss an assignment , a few more some days later to discuss the results . But those minutes must give undivided , unpressured attention to each child . They can mean the difference between doing work because " we got to " and doing it with love and enthusiasm that builds a desire for learning and pride in accomplishment . Whose attention should the child have ? Here age is undoubtedly a key factor . For the younger child it should probably be dominantly one teacher , preferred by and selected by the child . But for older children , it need not be just one , nor necessarily his regular teacher . For the brilliant child , it may have to he the master teacher : it has long been observed that highly intelligent pupils begin at quite tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But regardless of how this matter is worked out , it is apparent , I think , that the teachers who meet with the child alone or in very small groups , and give him regular personal attention , will come to know and understand him far better than is possible in the typical classroom situation . And if two or three teachers so meet with him regularly , the chances of accurate evaluation of his potential cued his progress are astronomically greater . // Personalization is the " pay-off " part of the educational process . Under the classroom system , it barely occurs at all as a warmly rewarding process between teacher and student , except in relatively rare special cases . ( If you have a child in a classroom school , ask how many five-minute , one-to-one talks he has had with teachers ? other than on " discipline " ! ) It needs to be made routine and effective for every child . Otherwise whatever teaching skill is available can never begin to bear full fruit . " Too often , schools reward only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured may be inconsequential in the conduct of human affairs . Children , like adults , see a certain expediency in doing that which is to be rewarded . Consequently , the world 's children spend shocking proportions of valuable time on that which is of little importance . " John I. Goodlad in School , Curriculum , and the Individual // UNDERSTANDING The 1958-1959 Annual Report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching includes a summary of a discussion by the trustees , themselves a score of highly distinguished educators , on the education of the " academically talented . " It begins : A basic aim of our society is to help each individual to fulfill the promise that is in him . Our educational system is the chief instrument for achieving that goal . To achieve it , the schools must recognize that children differ in their abilities and provide programs designed to develop the potentialities of children at each level . The principle stated is today everywhere honored , though not always set forth so succinctly . As we have glimpsed , the organizational backbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely intact from days when the approach was quite the contrary ? to treat each child alike and run him through an elementary learning mill . 109 Some of the schizoid strain caused by this anomaly is relieved in the minds of practicing educators by a resort to " guidance , " a word as glowing as it is indeterminate . For the guidance counselor is free of the classroom . He does work with students one by one , with the fullest recognition on every hand that each is a separate personality and not either a " norm " or a " deviant . " He is even likely to be given a small room or cubicle where he and a student may talk privately ! Sometimes it was , or still is , the broom closet ; but let us not quibble . The fact that guidance has entered the schools is a major beachhead , and that it has become established in many as a necessity ( though still subject to occasional attack as a budgetary " frill " ) is cause for cheer . The whole notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in response to the basic dilemma , but largely by historical accident ? the rapid growth of high schools early in this century , and the universal enactment and later enforcement of state legislation making attendance mandatory for practically all children late into the teens . If we are going to keep a child in school because the law says we must , it is necessary to provide a program for him that has some hope of holding his interest , and being capable of his accomplishment . Previously , high school automatically selected those who were considered suited for further study or preparation for college . Others dropped out of public education somewhere along the way , in many cases because of lack of desire for more education , inability to do very well , or the availability of employment . But with compulsory attendance and child labor laws , this winnowing process all but ended . Public school education became for all a longer process , and one greater in scope , and appallingly more acute and more apparent became the differences in abilities , interests and achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer different sequences of studies for those who would probably go to college , for those who might go to business , trade , or technical schools , or into some less academic occupation , or into homemaking . Further , many of these courses had to be offered on different intellectual levels . ( We can see why Dr. James Conant , in his report // The American High School Today , offers as a prime recommendation the elimination of high schools with senior classes of under one hundred students . ) As it happened , the popular discovery of " psychology , " and the development of psychological tests of some usefulness coincided with the great expansion of our high schools . Testing and guidance thus entered the schools more or less hand in hand . To most students who come into contact with " guidance " at all , the word calls up a picture of a counselor who can perhaps be seen after a good wait for an appointment , and who advises on what studies to take , what colleges to apply to , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also be available on much shorter notice if the student is a problem ? the more acutely he is failing his courses or causing other difficulties , the higher the priority . The words " guidance " and " counseling , " which are more or less interchangeable , have to be regarded with some caution : they are used to refer to highly trained , full-time specialists in some cases , and just as glibly to mean teachers assigned this work in addition to other duties , with no special training for it at all , or those who are taking spare-time courses to give them at least some background and " professional " understanding . In school systems that lack enough money to attract teachers to cover all classes , it is of course difficult to clear funds to hire guidance specialists , the more so because these persons are in a position to pick and choose where they will work . In the middle and lower range of high schools , then , highly trained " real " guidance people tend to be sparse . In junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in elementary schools , except for the top fraction , guidance is little more than an intention . Going by Office of Education figures for 1964 , about 30,000 guidance counselors were working in secondary schools ? or roughly one per school on average ( a good high school typically may have three to five ) . Of elementary schools over 100 students in size , three out of four lacked a guidance counselor even one day a week . ( It will help the reader to understand the woeful state of educational statistics if it is pointed out that the long under-
