Next to the electric outlet , hardly any American invention is as omnipresent as ice-cold cola . In bottle , can , cup or glass , cola is drunk from White House to roadhouse , and few Americans can travel far at work or play without finding an automatic cola dispenser handy . In the huge industry that has grown up to satisfy this thirst , 77-year-old Coca-Cola is still by far the leader , with 1962 sales of $568 million and profits of $47 million . Coke 's closest competitor is Pepsi-Cola , which has closed part of the gap in the last decade by aggressive marketing but still trails Coke with 1962 sales of $192 million and profits of $15 million . Third in the field , but far behind both Coke and Pepsi , is Royal Crown , with 1962 sales of $28 million . <P> With Cola products now enjoying an unprecedented international boom , the industry 's two giants are busily scrapping for a bigger share of the growing market . This week Coca-Cola begins a $53 million advertising campaign in which its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Coke calls a " one-sight , one-sound , one-sell " approach based on the slogan that " Things Go Better with Coke . " Fortnight ago at Pepsi-whose slogan is " For Those Who Think Young " - New President Donald Mclntosh Kendall , after only a month on the job , wielded a broom that swept out six vice presidents and will brush in a revamped , decentralized distribution system aimed at making Pepsi a more powerful challenger to Coke . <P> The Men &; the Problems . Pepsi 's Kendall , a husky , hard-working onetime fountain-syrup salesman who tripled sales and quintupled profits in six years as Pepsi 's international president , has much in common with Coca-Cola 's President J. Paul Austin , who took over his company last year . Both have Southern ties : Kendall was a football tackle for Western Kentucky State College ; Austin spent his early youth in LaGrange , Ga. , before moving up to Harvard Law School . Both are unusually young to head major corporations : Kendall is 42 , Austin 48 . Both advanced up the corporate ladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts for 41% of Pepsi 's sales and 42% of Coke 's . <P> When it gets down to the job each man faces , the similarities end . Besides trying to beef up Pepsi 's distribution and marketing system ( 520 U.S. outlets v. 1,100 for Coke ) , Kendall needs to broaden his one-product company , is searching around for likely food-line mergers . Austin , on the other hand , can look out from his executive suite in Atlanta on a far-flung organization that has already taken that step ; in addition to Coke , he has a promising line of frozen and canned juices , coffee and tea that accounts for 20% of Coke 's sales .
