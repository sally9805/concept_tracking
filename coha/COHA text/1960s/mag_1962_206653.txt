The program called it the $125,000 Washington , D.C. International , and 13 thoroughbreds from nine nations pranced to the post at Maryland 's Laurel Race Course . But to the fans , it was strictly a domestic affair , a test between the three top U.S. horses : Jack Dreyfus ' sprinter , Beau Purple ; Mrs. Richard C. duPont 's great gelding . Kelso ; and Jack Price 's millionaire colt , Carry Back . Ill-mannered catcalls greeted the Russian and Japanese entries , and Britain 's Pardao went off at 108-to-1 odds . <P> The only foreign horse with a following was France 's Match II . Beau Purple 's trainer , Allen Jerkens , said he was worried : " That French colt-he 's a brute . " Racing exclusively in Europe , where stakes horses get fewer chances to run and purses are generally smaller than in the U.S. , the muscular bay had already earned $283,000 for French Hotelman Franois Dupre , who owns Paris ' Plaza-Athenee , Montreal 's Ritz-Carlton , a breeding farm in Normandy and a string of 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yves Saint-Martin , France 's top rider , a vise-handed craftsman who , at 21 , already ranks with the world 's best . Even so , Match II went out as a 6-to-1 long shot . <P> More respect was due . Beau Purple ran his race at the start , then folded . Kelso and Carry Back staged a killing duel for the lead until Carry Back ran out of gas . and the victory chant " Kelso ! Kelso ! " started through the stands . But it was not the Americans ' day . Biding his time back in the pack , Saint-Martin deftly drove Match II past the winded field , coming through on the rail , gaining on Kelso with every long stride . " I saw him coming , " said Kelso 's jockey Ismael Valenzuela , " but I just could n't do anything about it . " At the finish , Match II was 1 lengths ahead and going away . Kelso 's second-place finish will probably earn him Horse of the Year honors in the U.S. Match II went home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race horse in the world .
