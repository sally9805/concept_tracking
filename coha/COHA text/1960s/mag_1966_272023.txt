NJEGOS by Milovan Djilas. 498 pages . Harcourt , Brace &; World . $10 . <P> Milovan Djilas is probably the world 's most publicized political prisoner . He may also be the most published . A former Vice Premier in Marshal Tito 's government , he was slapped into jail in 1956 for his sizzling censures of the regime . There he has languished loquaciously for almost a decade , fearlessly issuing criticism , history and fiction about life in Yugoslavia ( Conversations with Stalin , The New Class ) . This book , completed in 1959 , is the first detailed biography of Petar II Petrovic Njegos , Prince-Bishop ( from 1830 to 1851 ) of Djilas ' native Montenegro , and Serbia 's greatest poet . Njegos is severely out of phase with Djilas ' usually remarkable work , however . It is turgid in style and parochial in scope . Even in the U.S. , where there are more Serbs than in all Ljubljana , Njegos is not likely to find much more of an appreciative audience . <P> THE BALLAD OF DINGUS MAGEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This wild West spoof is stacked with enough sagebrush clichs to make it high Campfire . Runty Dingus Magee , who goes around building a reputation as a desperado by taking credit for other people 's crimes , is sometimes a delightful composite of all western bad men ; at other times , he is merely a hapless , scheming little schnook . As a result , parts of the book are rollickingly funny parody , while other parts are slapstuck.
