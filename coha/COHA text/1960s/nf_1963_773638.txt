txt SPACE AND TIME the celestial pole around which all the stars appear to travel in concentric circles . The orbital motion of the Earth round the Sun fixes a basic plane in space , describing a Great Circle along which the Sun appears to make its journey over the year ; this apparent path of the Sun is called the ecliptic . The intersection of the plane of the Earth 's equator and the ecliptic gives us the second axis of the empirical system of coordinates ; the point is defined by the vernal equinox , or the First Point of Aries . The celestial pole and the vernal point are the reference points for spherical coordinates . There is no particular mark in the sky which may be identified with either of these points , and their positions relative to the stars which form the framework of the empirical system has to be deduced from observation of the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens on the one hand , and from the annual apparent movement of the Sun on the other . Such observations show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing relative to the background of stars . From the point of view of celestial mechanics , the Earth resembles a top , which is spinning on its way round the Sun with its axis of rotation tilted at a given angle to its path . A top , however , begins to wobble when external forces act on it ; its axis of rotation alters its direction , and precession ' sets in . In the case of the Earth , the disturbing influences are the Sun and the Moon . Consequently the apparent celestial pole circles the pole of the ecliptic once in 26,000 years . At the same time the Moon causes the axis of the Earth to oscillate slightly ( nutation ) with a period of nineteen years . Even the ecliptic does not maintain a constant position in space , but alters slowly because of the gravitational pulls of the other planets . This causes additional movement of the equinox . Lastly , the fact that the velocity of light is finite means that it is subject to apparent aberration , so that the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not absolutely the true direction to that star ; the extent of this aberration depends on the velocity of the observer relative to the speed of light . // All in all , the stellar coordinates determined by the astronomers , as compared with those of the absolute system of celestial mechanics , tend to be distorted by a series of effects . By combining observation with theory , spherical astronomy with celestial mechanics , the sum of these effects , the reduction of the apparent position on the sphere to the true position ' , can be worked out in a fundamental system . Nevertheless , this can only be done by means of a process of approximations , since the accuracy with which the reduction can be calculated depends on the accuracy with which the necessary parameters are known at the time . Each improvement in the values of these constants , which it has been necessary to make in the course of time as a result of new observations , entails corrections of the coordinates and movements based on the fundamental system . This fundamental system of coordinates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecliptic at a particular point of time in relation to a number of chosen fixed ' stars , which make up the fundamental catalogue ' . Since the stars of this fundamental catalogue are not really fixed in the strictest sense of the term , but are themselves moving individually along certain courses , their location in space is changing . Hence the system of coordinates which they support also changes from the original . On the basis of the observations of the eighteenth century , Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel of Konigsberg compiled the Fundamenta Astronomic ? , the fundamental catalogue which served the astronomers of the nineteenth century as their system of coordinates . Around the turn of this century the Fundamentalkatalog des Berliner Jahrbuchs came into being as a result of the intensive survey of the heavens undertaken by the astronomers of the nineteenth century . The man behind this catalogue was Arthur von Auwers , who set up a mathematical centre at the Berlin Observatory ; this subsequently became independent as the Astronornisches Recheninstitut ' . Also he began collecting material for a card-index at the Academy of Sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . One of the traditional tasks of the Recheninstitut , which after the collapse of Germany in 1945 moved its headquarters to 41 spACE AND TIME Heidelberg , is to continue to improve the fundamental catalogue . Auwers himself compiled the Neuer Fundamentalkatalog ( NFK ) , which replaced the earlier work ( FK ) in 1907 . August Kopff , appointed to the Directorship of the Berlin Rechininstitut from Heidelberg in 1924 , brought out a third revision ( FK3 ) in 1937-38 , and in the difficult war and postwar years prepared the ground for FK4 , which his successor Walter Fricke is now publishing under the auspices of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences . In accordance with a resolution passed by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) in 1955 the Fundamentalkatalog des Berliner Jahrbuchs , in which the number of stars listed has risen from 925 under Auwers to 1,587 in the latest edition , now forms the basis for all astronomical position determining ; it represents the obligatory international system of astronomical coordinates . To what extent is this system absolute in terms of classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should once more examine how each of the two systems , which we are comparing , is to be defined . The empirical system is determined by the positions of the equator and the ecliptic at a particular time , let us say 1950-0 for FK4 , relative to the positions and individual motions of the fundamental stars , and the constants required for reducing apparent to true position ; the relevant constants are precession , nutation , aberration and parallax . The theoretical , i.e. absolute , system of coordinates is only an abstraction based on the claim that within its framework the laws of mechanics are valid . Classical mechanics are founded on the law of inertia ? Newton 's first law : a body will remain at rest , or move uniformly in a straight line , so long as no other forces act on it . Consequently the theoretical system of coordinates is also known as the inertial system . The laws of mechanics which an astronomer is best able to test are primarily those which govern movement within the planetary system , that is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brings us back to the question raised in the first chapter : Can all the finer details of the motions of the // planets and their satellites be wholly explained by Newton 's law of gravity , or , when one compares observation with theory , do certain considerations arise which indicate a divergence from the exact truth of Newton 's equation ? To put this more finely : if differences between observation and theory do occur , then it has first to be shown to what extent such differences can be attributed to a shifting of the empirical system , which is based on fundamental stars , in contrast to the inertial system . The possible rotation of the empirical system of coordinates was actually considered in attempts to explain the movement of Mercury 's perihelion . On the other hand , apparent deviations from theory could have quite another origin . If the inertial system is introduced as a system of coordinates in which the mechanical laws of motion are valid , then it must be remembered that time features in these laws as an independent dimension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of gravity , give positions relative to absolute time in the Newtonian sense , i.e. based on an inertial system . Observations based on the fundamental system give such positions in relation to empirical , i.e. astronomical , time , which is based on the rotation of the Earth ; the mean second of time , which the physicist also uses , is a 24 x 60 x 60 = 86,400th part of the mean solar day . For the purpose of measuring astronomical time , however , any other periodic celestial motion can equally well be used ; for instance the revolution of the Moon round the Earth , or the orbital period of a planet round the Sun , or the orbital periods of any of the four bright satellites of Jupiter ; any of these occurrences would be suitable regulators for measuring time , astronomically speaking . If a number of different clocks show various times at a given moment , one might well wonder which , if any , is right . Furthermore , if , on comparing a number of clocks with one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on average these clocks are all either in advance or all behind the standard clock by roughly the same amount , then it might be as well to question the accuracy of the regulator , or standard clock . This is exactly what astronomers discovered at the beginning // of this century , when they compared the various cosmic clocks . It was already known that the apparent acceleration of the Moon in its orbit round the Earth ? a fact which conventional lunar theory was not able to account for ? could be attributed to slow running ' on the part of the Earth clock itself . Solar observations showed an apparent increase in the Earth 's orbital velocity , and similar effects could be detected in the motions of the planets Mercury and Venus . Thus it became clear that the fault must lie with the timing device on which astronomers were relying , that the rotation of the Earth on its axis is not uniform , and that this is the real reason for the apparent disparity between practice and theory . Brown , who was Newcomb 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the lunar theory , came to this conclusion in 1914 ; later , in 1928 , the Dutch theorist Willem de Sitter , who was at that time engaged on a study of astronomical constants , demonstrated that the Earth clock was by no means uniformly fast or slow , but that it was subject to fairly sudden changes . Abrupt changes could be shown to have taken place in 1897 and again in 1918 . It was at this moment that a technological discovery made it possible to tackle the problem of time without recourse to astronomical observations . In 1929 , Harrison in Britain made the first successful quartz clock ; this device uses the fact that a quartz crystal vibrates at a definite and constant frequency , when stimulated by an alternating electric field . The frequency of the vibrations in the crystal depends solely on the characteristics of its internal structure , and will therefore remain constant so long as these characteristics themselves are not changed as a result of some external stimulus ( i.e. fluctuating temperature ) . The quartz clock provided astronomers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times more accurate than the conventional pendulum clock . Continual checks on astronomical time determinations by means of quartz clocks substantiated the corrections required by the Earth clock , which apparent discrepancies in the motions of the Sun , Moon , Mercury and Venus , and the satellites of // Jupiter had indicated . Since 1935 it has been known that the Earth does not rotate uniformly on its axis ; consequently , although it serves perfectly adequately as a timing device for ordinary purposes , it is unsuitable for work demanding extreme accuracy . This would seem an apt place for some general remarks on time and its measurement . It is possible to measure the passage of time only in terms of certain definite intervals or pulses . We can express the time at which a given event occurred in multiples of certain agreed units ? seconds , days , years ? as reckoned from a particular , but nevertheless arbitrary , zero point . The various components of a clock form a vibratory system by means of which the unit of time is established , and the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time units which have passed . The actual clock , in comparison with the idealistic clock ( which would indicate the even passage of time ) , possesses at any given moment both a definite correction ' as well as a rate ' . The correction indicates to what extent the hands show the wrong time at that particular moment , while the rate indicates by how much the vibrations deviate from the theoretical value , that is to say the error compared with a uniform passage of time . Normally we do not differentiate between the two terms . If someone says My watch is fast ' , it can mean simply that the hands show a time which is in advance of what is true at that moment , or that the watch gains a certain amount during any given period . In the first instance the reference is to correction , and the error can be remedied by altering the positions of the hands , whereas in the second it refers to the rate which could be brought to zero by altering the vibratory mechanism within the watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand is the direction towards the vernal point , while the celestial equator with its twenty-four hourly divisions represents the dial . In this clock ' t he dial moves past a mark . Astronomical time based on the Earth clock is liable to be erratic for two reasons , uneven movement of the dial , that is to say variations in the rotation period // of the Earth , and also the fact that the supposedly fixed mark , the vernal point , shifts . This leads to the following thought : the effects of changes in the movement of a clock are cumulative , and over a long peroid even a slight error can build up to quite a considerable value . If , for example , the rotation velocity of the Earth reduces by as little as one ten-millionth , which would increase the length of the day by less than a hundredth of a second , then after one year astronomical time will be in error by something in excess of three seconds ; in a century the error will have grown to a full five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults in coordinating position and time ; an error of one-tenth of a second of time results in an apparent displacement of position amounting to 11 seconds of arc . It will have become obvious why a study of the unevenness of the Earth 's rotation period is vitally important for celestial mechanics . If we examine the average length of the mean solar day during the period from 1750 to 1917 in terms of astronomical time , we find that the following corrections have to be made to the Earth clock : from minus 12 seconds in 1710 the value changed to plus 8 seconds by 1785 ; from that year until 1865 the value dropped again with some minor fluctuations to plus 3 seconds ; in 1865 there was evidently a sudden change in the rate of the Earth clock , for the correction value sank to minus 8 seconds in the course of a few years ( 1880 ) , and remained steady at this level until the next sudden leap in 1897 . Then the rotation of the Earth began to speed up once more , shortening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that by 1917 the time error had risen to as much as 20 seconds . As from 1917 the loss each day has been only half as much , but even so the value of correction had reached 33 seconds by 1960 . The realisation that the rotation period of the Earth is by no means a reliable time-keeper for astronomical purposes has led to a change in defining the unit of time . The new definition of a second of time is no longer founded on the mean solar day , the period of the Earth 's rotation on its axis , and the tropical year // is used instead ; this is the interval between two successive passages of the Sun through the vernal point . Thus in terms of the new definition a second of time represents a 31,556,925.975th part of the tropical year 1900 . Coincidental with the new definition of the unit of time , a new concept of time itself was introduced : Newton 's theoretical absolute time , which had temporarily been called mathematical or inertial time , was henceforth to be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was entailed in reducing apparent positions based on the empirical system of coordinates to the inertial system of coordinates , now exists in converting empirical time to ephemeris time . The factors for this conversion have to be deduced from observations of the movements of bodies in the planetary system . This means that time corrections can be given only in retrospect , after observations over a given period of time have been evaluated and discussed , so long as we have to rely on clocks in which the measurement of time is not made independent of the processes of mechanical movement . With the quartz clock we are already approaching such a new type of time measuring instrument . Its accuracy and freedom from the effects of external stimuli are not quite such as to provide the required uniformity of the passage of time over a decade or even a century which research now demands . Such high demands are likely to be met only with the development of clocks which rely on the vibrations of molecules ( ammonia clock ) or of atoms ( cesium clock ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would neither gain nor lose more than something in the order of one second in three hundred years. * The efforts made and results obtained in the first half of the present century in order to determine and define the system of coordinates can be summarised as follows : I. The system of coordinates represented by FK4 provides , with a very high degree of approximation , an inertial system . 2 . As a result of observations of the Moon and the planets , // corrections to astronomical time based on the axial rotation of the Earth give a fairly close approximation of ephemeris time , which corresponds with Newton 's concept of absolute time . 3 . In the motions of the four inner planets ? Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars ? and of the Moon there are no longer any irreconcilable discrepancies between observation and theory , when for the purposes of computing the relevant perturbation corrections based on the theory of relativity are taken into account . This last brings us to a point which has not yet been discussed . So far the emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made of the now famous words with which H. Minkowski , a Gottingen mathematician , introduced his lecture on Space and Time ' at a congress of Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher and Arzte ' ( Cologne 1908 ) . The ideas of space and time which I would like to expound have their roots in the field of experimental physics . This is their strong-point . They tend to be radical . From now on space as such and time as such will cease to exist as separate entities , and only a union of both will exist . ' From that time on , no astronomer could allow a three dimensional system of spatial coordinates , a system which excluded Einstein 's fourth coordinate , time . All celestial bodies move in a four dimensional Space ? Time universe . Within the scope of the discussion so far , the relativity effect has played no more than a subordinate role , simply minor corrections to classical theory . The significance increases when we are dealing with distances of galactic proportions and with velocities comparable with that of light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System In the year 1915 a series of articles began in the Astrophysical Journal under the title Studies Based on the Colours and Magnitudes of Stellar Clusters ' . The author of these studies was a young American astronomer named Harlow Shapley who was engaged in photographic-photometric investigations of star clusters with the 60-inch reflector on Mt . Wilson . He devoted his attention principally to what are known as Globular Clusters , a good example of which is that in the constellation Hercules . Article VII of the series ( 1918 ) bears the title The Distances , Distribution in Space , and Dimensions of 69 Globular Clusters ; number XII , Remarks on the Arrangement of the Sidereal Universe . In these remarks the star system of the classical period , a concept first propounded by William Herschel on the basis of his star counts , and which Seeliger and Kapteyn thought they had described conclusively , was now superseded by a new idea , which envisaged a galactic system from five to ten times greater in its dimensions , and in which the Sun was sited near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Copernican ' turning point was thus established , having been brought about through the application of improved methods of distance determining , methods which no longer relied solely on geometric principles ? light rays are straight lines ? but on the physical nature of stars themselves and on the belief that the laws of physics were universal . During the early twenties there was a great deal of discussion STRUCTURE OF THE MILKY WAY SYSTEM concerning this Greater Galactic System ' and Shapley 's proposed scale of distances . There were also attempts to reconcile the old with new , the idea of a subordinate system ; descriptions such as Local System ' or Local Cluster ' were coined to meet the situation . In the minutes of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1920 Seeliger described a Typical Star System ' as he called it , based on the most recent star counts then available . Kapteyn did likewise in 1921 in the Astrophysical Journal under the title First attempt at a theory of the arrangement and motion of the sidereal system ' . Alternatively efforts were made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System . Charlier suggested a view of the system of globular clusters in which their apparent diameters are used to establish a scale of distances . Pannekoek 's method of determining distances was based on the distribution function of luminosities . Seeliger attempted to show that , through absorption of light , Shapley 's scale of distances was markedly in error . All these efforts succeeded in shaking the foundations of the photometric method of distance determining , so that the main task in the twenties and thirties was the clarification of this point . The uncertainty of the situation was emphasised in a report by August Kopff in Vol . II of Ergebnisse der exacten Naturwissenschaften ( 1925 ) ; he writes : It seems invariably the fate of the typical system to appear inadequate so soon as the transition to the actual system is made . The typical system must be adapted so as to correspond to reality . However , the proposed distances far exceed admissible limits . . . . Contradictions really do exist , and their solution is not yet clear . Perhaps , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stellar voids and accumulations just happen to have occurred and so we have the impression of a gradual reduction in stellar densities as we move outwards . . . . It could also be the case that the distances proposed by Shapley are vastly in excess of their true values . . . . But we could only reasonably assume a lower distance value in the universe , if the relationship between absolute luminosity and spectral properties , or else the behaviour of variables as we // know them in the neighbourhood of the Sun , do not apply universally . This is not very probable ; observational information to date favours considerable physical homogeneity in the universe . ' In an obituary of Seeliger in 1924 I wrote : Seeliger 's fundamental works , like those of Kapteyn , so far as they are based on star counts and mean parallaxes , are a part of history . Opinions have changed . The time has come when the fiction of a universally applicable distribution function of absolute luminosities must disappear from arguments concerning the structure of the universe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star 's spectral classification is of greater significance than its absolute brightness , and in any case precludes independent consideration of either . Seeliger 's Typical System may be summarised as follows : At the centre , families of stars passing through each other , which betray their common origin in traces of a common motion and similarities of state ; at the edges the system merges more or less gradually into individual Milky Way clouds , and the whole appears to be embedded in one large system whose members are globular clusters and spiral nebula . ' In 1926 Gunnar Malmquist , a young Swedish astronomer of the school of Charlier , reported on an investigation in which he took a model star system of given density distribution , and calculated the number of stars theoretically visible from the centre of this system ; then , on the basis of his results , he used the methods of classical stellar statistics to derive the density law from these calculated star numbers , that is to say the spatial distribution of stars in the system . The model he chose had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with stars surrounded by ? shell also uniformly filled with stars , and between the two a Void space of the same thickness as the outer shell . Analysis of the star counts gave a picture which was quite different from actuality . The density of stars appeared to fall off uniformly from the centre outwards , rather like a similar sort of hw which Seeliger and Kapteyn had evolved for the Milky Way // system . The starless zone of the real model was not at all evident ? a truly alarming result , from which it was necessary to deduce that perhaps the old star system had no real substance . On the basis of what we now know about the structure of the stellar system it is not difficult to see why the methods of stellar statistics , which rested solely upon counts of stars according to their apparent magnitudes and proper motions , inevitably led to a false impression . In the first place , the simplifications introduced for a formal mathematical treatment of the problem were too sweeping . The system can not , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a density function dependent on distance from the Sun and vertical distance from the plane of the Milky Way ( which is assumed to be the plane of symmetry ) , and a distribution function of absolute luminosities independent of location . Through the smoothing of observed numbers of stars , in particular the blurring of distinctly cloud-like irregularities in the distribution of stars along the band of the Milky Way , the characteristic trends of actual spatial distribution are lost . The direction towards the true centre of the system , indicated through accumulations of very faint stars and globular star clusters , and lying far from our Sun , could not emerge from the formulmae from which the density distribution was deduced . Furthermore , the empirical data of star counts , which were available for such calculations , and the mean parallaxes derived from apparent proper motions were not sufficiently comprehensive to include such faint stars ; consequently they could hardly be expected to reveal conditions in the more distant reaches . Evaluation of the data gained by Kapteyn as a result of the plan of selected areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It soon became evident that the star fields , which had been selected in the light of the classical concept of what constituted a typical system , were not representative of the real Greater Galactic system . Yet another consideration is probably the underestimation of the effect of absorption of light as a result of diffuse matter // scattered through interstellar space , clouds of gas and cosmic dust , which manifest themselves as starless patches . As from about the year 1924 no doubt remained regarding the reality and the dimensions of the Greater Galactic System as defined through the globular clusters . In a discussion at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington in April 1920 between Harlow Shapley and H. D. Curtiss on The Scale of the Universe ' the arguments in favour of the greater system eventually proved themselves more convincing ; the idea of physical unity in the cosmos had become established . Further investigations could only fill in the details and determine an exact scale of distances , that is to say the distance of the Sun from the centre of the system . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of individual objects , and could be used only in a limited sense for groups of objects , which had been selected according to various sorts of physical parameters . Spectral class , absolute magnitude , type and period of variability of Cepheid stars , and the velocity and direction of spatial movement are the most important of these parameters . With refinements in the analyses of proper motion and radial velocities a new insight was gained . It was soon realised that the direction of the apparent movement of the Sun differed according to the magnitude of the particular stars on whose proper motion the calculations had been based . Similarly , when calculating the velocity of the solar motion from the radial velocities of stars , it was found that the value differed with the spectral class , and that there was a marked difference between giants and dwarfs , and this even led to the discovery of a group of stars with especially high velocities . By about 1924 the various findings had coalesced into the following views : 1 . The velocity of the Sun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars in its immediate vicinity , and 35 ? 50 km. /sec. relative to those lying at a greater distance , while it exceeds 2(X) km. /sec. relative to the system of globular clusters . // 2 . The direction of apparent solar motion relative to the system of globular clusters is almost perpendicular to the direction towards the centre of the galactic system . 3 . The directions in which the high-velocity stars move fall into two distinct groups symmetrical with the direction towards the centre . The significance of this phenomenon was explained simultaneously by Lindblad in Uppsala , and by Oort in Leyden in 1926-27 , namely that the Milky Way system is in rotation about the centre determined by Shapley . The high velocity observed in the Sun 's movement relative to the globular clusters is due to the Sun 's orbital velocity . The high-velocity stars are stars travelling in eccentric ellipses rather similar to those of the comets in the planetary system . The picture presented by the motions of the stars in the immediate neighbourhood of the Sun is essentially determined by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . In fact orbital velocity tends to decrease with distance from the centre of the system ; those members of the system which lie closer to its centre than the Sun race ahead of the Sun , while those lying farther out are left behind . This differential rotation can be detected in the characteristics of proper motion and radial velocities relative to the Sun , if one plots the values of the observed velocities against their direction . In four directions at right angles to each other they are at zero ; in the intermediate directions they attain alternate positive or negative maximal values . This double wave ' in the radial velocities is one of the main props of the rotation theory . From it the constants of galactic rotation may be calculated ? that is to say the direction towards the centre of rotation , how far this centre is from the Sun , and the orbital velocity of the Sun around this centre . The result of Oort 's first calculations showed the centre of rotation to be identical with Shapley 's centre of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the centre of the system , and travels at an orbital velocity of approximately 250 // km. /sec. , so that the orbital period is something in the order of 250 million years . In developing further details of the rotation theory it had to be borne in mind that movement within the Milky Way system is not , as in the Solar System , governed by a body of overwhelmingly large mass ; consequently the orbits of the stars are by no means simple Keplerian ellipses , let alone circles . The decisive factor governing movement is to be found in the spatial distribution of masses . Since not all these masses are directly visible as stars , or even luminous gas clouds , a great deal depends on determining the mass and distribution of interstellar matter . Research into interstellar absorption thus became doubly important : first , because light is weakened in its passage through the interstellar medium and thus falsifies the results of phototelemetry ; second , because the light is not only weakened , but also changes its colour ? the greater the distance through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redder it appears . This provides a clue to the composition and mean density of interstellar matter . The sort of ideas which had grown up by about 1930 concerning the structure of the galactic system can be learned from some short extracts from A Textbook of Astronomy by Elis and Bengt Stromgren ( father and son ) , the foreword to which is dated 1932 : Open star clusters , globular clusters , loose clusters , Cepheids , red long-period variables , and novae create a spatial impression of the following nature : two great systems at some distance from each other ; the globular clusters primarily belong to one system , though some lie far from its centre . These two principal systems are usually referred to as the local system and the Sagittarian system . It is quite possible , even probable , that the system , which we call local , extends along the plane of the Milky Way . There is therefore a possibility that we belong to a coherent Milky Way system , which is arranged along one and the same plane with the Sagittarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system along the plane of the Milky Way would then be // in the nature of 30,000 parsecs , and the Sun is located fairly eccentricly . On the other hand , there is also a possibility that the Sagittarian system and the local system are both limited in their extent , which would mean that the Milky Way system is made up of these two systems , and a few globular star clusters ( lying far from the Sagittarian centre ) , as well as perhaps some other system or systems as yet unknown . The idea of the entire Milky Way system as one coherent system having rotational symmetry about an axis passing through the Sagittarian centre and perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way has in its favour the fact that it allows a single explanation for the motions of bodies in the vicinity of the Sun . Against this there is the argument that , apart from the Milky Way system , we know of no external system whose diameter is in the order of 30,000 parsecs , although super-systems consisting of a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions have been observed . ' In the years that followed there was a trend towards reconciling dimensional differences between our Galaxy on the one hand , and the Andromeda Galaxy on the other . Taking the absorption factor into account in determining the distances of the globular clusters , brought about a reduction in the dimensions of the Milky Way system , above all its diameter . By means of direct photo-electric measurements of the Andromeda Galaxy it became possible to trace the turns of the spiral arms much farther outwards than the photographic method had allowed ; this suggested that the Andromeda system is in fact larger than Hubble had supposed . Comparable studies of the Andromeda Spiral on the one hand and the Milky Way system on the other began to point more and more definitely to the conclusion that the two systems are essentially similar . We can view the Andromeda system as a whole from our distant vantage point in space ; consequently many of its features appear simplified and more clear-cut . From 1935 at the latest , one could consider the alternative ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been // amply refuted , and one was in a position to say : The flat , lensshaped system of the classical epoch of stellar astronomy is a myth . It is not possible to reconcile it with the Greater Galactic system as defined by the globular clusters simply by enlarging the scale , nor can it be included in such a system as a distinct subordinate system . The Greater Galactic system is an entity ; the globular clusters form its frame-work ; the Sun is situated 8,000-10,000 parsecs from the centre , in a star cloud within one of the spiral arms . ' The work of one particular man has been of immense significance so far as the clarification and confirmation of our understanding of the structure of the Milky Way system is concerned . I le knew just how to get the best out of the two largest instruments available , the 100-inch on Mt . Wilson and the 200-inch on Mt . Palomar . Walter Baade was born in 1893 , and after graduating at Gottingen became assistant to Felix Klein , the mathematician ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the 1-metre reflector at the Hamburg Observatory . At the Mt . Wilson Observatory , where he became one of the permanent assistants , he was soon acknowledged as an authority on problems relating to the structure of the Milky Way system and the extragalactic universe . In 1943 , using the 100-inch , Baade succeeded in achieving partial resolution of stars in some of the elliptical nebula , as well as in the inner regions of the Andromeda Galaxy . Success came not through sheer chance , but through the idea that the brightest stars of the extragalactic systems were likely to be red giants , just as the brightest stars of the globular clusters , and should therefore register individually on panchromatic photographic plates , if a strong red filter were used to cut out the background of weaker non-resolvable stars . The success of this method not only brought confirmation of Baade 's theory concerning the existence of two different star populations , but also its practical application in the study of the Milky Way system . " The various stellar spectral types occur in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiral arms of the outer regions ; in Population I of the spiral arms bright blue or white // stars predominate , while in Population II of the nucleus there is a predominance of red giants . A few years later at a conference in Michigan on The Structure of the Milky Way System ' , Baade was able to announce further results of his investigations of the Andromeda Spiral . He found that there were also stars of Population II in the outer regions , and that they had even been detected by photo-electric methods in the outermost limits of the system , whereas stars belonging to Population I were confined to the spiral arms , where they were associated with emission nebulae and interstellar matter . The inference drawn from this knowledge about the Andromeda Galaxy on the structure of the Milky Way system found surprising corroboration in 1951 as a result of certain efforts in the field of radio astronomy . The sources of 21 cm. radiations emanating from interstellar hydrogen trace the extent of at least three distinctly defined spiral arms , one of which contains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress in Rome , Baade made the exciting announcement that the distance and thus also the dimensions of the Andromeda Spiral as calculated by Hubble should be doubled . In this way the last remaining discrepancy , which had been such an embarrassment in the early 1930s , the fact that the Milky Way system was apparently so much bigger than the extragalactic systems , was swept away . The Milky Way system is well within the observed range of diameters of galaxies , and does not differ essentially from the Andromeda system . The concept of the Milky Way system , which replaced that proposed by Karl Schwarzschild in 1909 , may be summarised as follows : The Milky Way system is similar in structure to the great spiral galaxies with their clearly recognisable arms . There is a distinction between the nucleus , a sort of extra large globular accumulation of stars which has a diameter of about 15,000 light-years , and the surrounding flat disc containing the spiral arms which has a maximum extent of 100,000 light-years in the main plane of the system , and a thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a sort of globe- // shaped halo , whose diameter is at least 150,000 light-years , and which consists of a loose scattering of stars and globular star clusters . This remarkable , and to a certain extent geometric , division into three distinct parts , corresponds to differences in the distribution of stars , star clusters and interstellar matter . Globular clusters , long-period variables , and high-velocity stars , now thought to be the oldest members of the system , make up the population of the halo . In the disc we find not only stars of the same kind as those which occur in the nucleus , but also planetary nebulae , short-period variables , and stars of manifestly low metallic content , all of them also relatively ancient objects . Along the spiral arms bedded in this disc are the stars of Population I , the galactic ( open ) star clusters interspersed at random with interstellar gas and dust . The population of the spiral arms contains the youngest members of the system . The total mass of the entire system is something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sun . About 23% of the mass is evenly distributed through the halo ; the disc and nucleus account for 67% , while the remaining 10% represent the content of the spiral arms . Ninety per cent of the overall mass is concentrated in stars ; 10% is in the form of diffuse gas , while the dust content is no more than something in the order of one per thousand . The position of the Sun within this system can be given by means of the following references : distance from centre 25,000 light-years , height above the galactic plane north 45 light-years . The rotation is like that of the Andromeda Spiral ; the innermost part ( nucleus ) turns at constant angular velocity , that is to say it behaves like a solid body ; outwards from the nucleus , angular velocity decreases with distance . In the region where the Sun is located rotational velocity is about 217 km. /sec. , equivalent to an orbital period of 234 million years or so . Some of the stellar orbits take the form of very eccentric ellipses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where the Sun lies . None of the orbits , however , seems to be more than slightly inclined to the general galactic plane . 59 5 ? The Realm of the Nebulae What are galaxies ? No one knew before 1900 . Very few people knew in 1920 . All astronomers knew after 1924 . ' Words to this effect appear in the introduction to the Hubble Atlas of Nebulae . It then goes on to explain : Galaxies are the largest single aggregates of stars in the universe . Each galaxy is a stellar system somewhat like our Milky Way , and isolated from its neighbours by near empty space . In popular terms , each galaxy is a separate " island universe " unto itself . ' The dilemma , which the debate between Shapley and Curtiss before the National Academy of Sciences ( Washington , 1920 ) emphasised , was due to the apparent inability to reconcile the scale of Shapley 's proposed Greater Galactic system , and the idea that this system and the Andromeda Spiral were in any way comparable in their dimensions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirals could be given only when it became possible to determine the distances of these objects ? much the same as in the case of the globular star clusters . The principle which is used for these measurements lies in the connection between the period of the light change of a particular type of variable star , and luminosity ; this is known as the Period-Luminosity Law ' of the Cepheids . Cepheids in other systems were first discovered in 1922 ( Messier 33 ) , and in 1923 ( New General Catalogue 6822 ) ; towards the end of 1923 Hubble was able to obtain the positive identification of the first Cepheid variable in the Andromeda Spiral . // An observation programme with the 100-inch telescope which was begun at this time rapidly led to further discoveries . By the end of 1924 , already thirty-six variables had been detected in the Andromeda Spiral , twelve of which were recognised as Cepheids ; in M.33 the number was twenty-two Cepheids , and in NGC 6822 eleven . This provided proof of the extragalactic nature of the spirals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , for the Solar System we have the Astronomical Unit ( AU = 150 million km. ) , and within our Galaxy , the Milky Way system , the unit is the kiloparsec ' ( = 206 million AU = 3,260 light-years ) , but when we are dealing with distances between the galaxies even these units are too small , and we must reckon in megaparsecs ' ( = 206,000 million A U = 3+ million light-years ! ) . The Swedish astronomer Knut Lundmark made an important contribution to this question of distance . He was the first to estimate distances of the order of several million light-years based on the appearances of novae in the spiral nebula , working on the assumption that these novae were likely to be of the same kind as those we know in our own galaxy , and that these phenomena share a common physical background . He suggested that all novae attain at their peak the same absolute brilliance ' . This hypothesis has since been corroborated but with the modification that there are in fact two kinds of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose luminous intensities differ by a factor of 100 to 1,000 . From 1925 to 1936 there appeared in the Astrophysical Journal a series of articles under the heading Studies of Extragalactic Nebulae ' , just as in the previous decade there had been articles by Harlow Shapley on the globular clusters and the Greater Galactic system . The author of this series was Edwin B. Hubble ; his instrument was the Hooker Telescope , the 100-inch reflector of the Mt . Wilson Observatory , which in 1921 ? 22 yielded the first photographs of NGC 6822 and M.33 revealing star-like condensations , and subsequently led to the discovery of some variables . In his book The Realm of the Nebula , published in 1936 , Hubble described all that was then known about them . // Here are some of the more pertinent points from the book which will show the sort of ideas current during that decade . The first fixing of a scale of distances presupposes the resolution of the nearest objects , and the identification of individual star-like features on photographs as true stars . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few hundred thousand light-years , then even the smallest distinguishable and apparently single point of light could nevertheless be a collection of stars in actuality ; this is because at a distance of 500,000 light-years any group of stars which occupies a space one hundred times as large as the Solar System ( diameter 6,000 AU = 0.1 light-years ) appears no bigger than 0.04 seconds of arc , and , even under the best possible observing conditions , this is beyond the resolving power of a 100-inch instrument , since in such a telescope the theoretical image of a single star has a diameter of this order . It is possible to decide whether a particular object happens to be a single star or a group of stars , if the star-like condensation displays a variation in its brilliance similar to that of certain variables in the Milky Way system . Since the light curves worked out by Hubble from numerous photographs of the Andromeda Spiral taken over a long period of time completely agree in form , period and amplitude with those of classical Cepheids in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain by the year 1924 that these smallest elements of resolution were in fact individual stars of great intensity . The next step was to compare other bright star-like objects with the bluish and whitish stars , as well as the reddish irregular variables in the Milky Way system , thus making it possible to determine the distances of galaxies still farther away ; for in these distant objects only the brightest stars can be distinguished from the general background haze of fainter stars , and the Cepheids are utterly swamped . Having established the range of the Andromeda Spiral at approximately 900,000 light-years , the insular nature of the galaxies was adequately proven , but the general similarity with the Milky Way system was by no means clear as yet . There was a discrepancy which could be stated in // the form that , if nebulae were island universes , the galactic system was a continent ' ( Hubble ) . It has already been explained how , in the course of time , new discoveries helped to resolve this discrepancy . The continent ' shrank as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured , while the island ' grew through the discovery of its outermost contours . Some disagreement remained in a comparison of individual features found in both systems . The nebulous-looking objects found by Hubble in the Andromeda Spiral in 1932 , and provisionally identified by him as globular clusters ' , were apparently one to two times fainter than corresponding clusters in the Milky Way system . In an intensive search of the heavens for extragalactic objects , whose numbers soon swelled to millions , it became evident that their apparent distribution in the sky , as well as their actual distribution in space , was by no means uniform , but that instead galaxies often tend to occur in groups . Already at the beginning of the century , Max Wolf had suggested the existence of such nests of nebula ' , and discovered a great cluster of nebula in the constellation of Coma Berenices in 1901 , and in 1905 that in Perseus . Then in the twenties Shapley and Miss Ames carried out their investigations of the heavens at the Harvard Observatory , and this served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nebulae . There emerged from these investigations one particular group or cluster which subsequently became known as the Local Group ' , and held a special significance because our own Milky Way system seemed to belong to it . In his list of 1936 , apart from the two great spirals M.31 in Andromeda and M.33 in Triangulum , Hubble included as members of this Local Group the two elliptical companions of the Andromeda Spiral and four irregular ' systems of the same type as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds of the southern hemisphere . The diameters of these systems range from 800 light-years for M.32 , the almost spherical companion of the Andromeda Spiral , and 40,000 lightyears for the Andromeda Spiral itself , while the combined luminosity is equivalent to between 2 million Suns on the one // hand and 1,000 million on the other . This wide range both in dimensions and in luminosities has to be taken into account if the distance of a given system is to be deduced from its apparent diameter and magnitude , when it is too far away to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . Thus a luminosity function ' plays a part , in the same way as in the methods of classical stellar statistics , for a study of the structure of the Milky Way system . Research into the movements of spiral galaxies brought unexpected , and at first incomprehensible , results . In 1914 Slipher , at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona , published his first list of fifteen radial velocities , which were used to calculate the movement of the Sun relative to the spirals . The velocities were found to be not only extremely high ( between 300 and 1,800 krn. /sec. ) in comparison with those of stars , but also , with very few exceptions , directed away from the Sun . The idea of a general dispersal of the galaxies at a mean velocity in the order of 600 km. /sec. became increasingly obvious as observational data accumulated , and at the same time it could be seen that there was a connection between velocity and distance . In 1929 the radial velocities of forty-six spiral galaxies had been listed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They covered a range of distances of 6 million light-years , and radial velocities up to 1,100 km. /sec. ; for every million lightyears velocity increased by about 170 km. /sec . This is the velocity ? distance relation ' which Hubble reported to the National Academy of Sciences in March 1929 , and which is now generally known as the Hubble Relation ' . If this relation expresses a universally applicable law governing the velocity distribution of the galaxies , analogous to Kepler 's Third Law which shows the relationship between orbital periods and distances of the planets from the Sun in the Solar System , then we may employ it as a means of determining the distances of faint galaxies , where photometric methods , which must rely on the ability to resolve the brightest stars , fail because this is no longer feasible . In order to plumb the farthest extent of the realm of the nebulae , work began at the Mt . Wilson 64 THE REALM OF THE NEBULIE . Observatory with the 100-inch to try to determine the radial velocities of the very faintest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first piece of irrefutable evidence was available , a velocity of almost 4,000 km. /sec. , which would therefore correspond to a distance of some 25 million lightyears . The inferences drawn from Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity concerning the possible structure of a space-time universe allowed the relationship between velocity and distance to be seen in another light . At the end of his report Hubble wrote as follows : Meanwhile it is worth noting that the velocity-distance relation might perhaps be an example of the de Sitter Effect , and that , as a result , the numerical data could enter into discussions on the general curvature of space . ' In 1916-17 de Sitter had found a solution of the equations of general relativity which led to an open hyperbolic world model in contrast to the closed spherical model which Einstein had derived . In the de Sitter universe , a red shift should be observable in the spectra of the galaxies , and , if this is interpreted as a Doppler Effect , would lead to the general impression of outward-fleeing nebulae . Its importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prominent place in debate during the years that followed . After the de Sitter universe had been recognised as a special instance of a non-static universe , and a whole multitude of theoretically possible models for nonstatic universes had been formulated , it seemed for a while as if the Hubble Relation might supply the answer as to which of the models possible in theory was likely to be most representative of the real universe . Before this could happen , however , observations had to include velocities more or less comparable with that of light , because it is only in such circumstances that the inference of the theory becomes at all clear . At the same time , the distances of objects with such high radial velocities would have to be determined through independent methods ? from apparent magnitudes or diameters ? if any deviation from linearity were to be detected in the relation . THE REALM OF THE NEBUL.E Considerations regarding the age of the universe are closely coupled with those of an expanding universe . If what we are seeing today is the universe in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of what might have caused such expansion to take place . Further , if one imagines the phenomenon to be similar to an exploding grenade , it raises the question at which point of time in the past the explosion of this grenade ' might have taken place . If it is assumed that the Hubble Relation expresses the rule according to which the expansion is proceeding , then it is possible to calculate from this how much time has elapsed since the universe began to expand . Supposing that the expansion is taking place uniformly , it follows from the Hubble constant of 170 km. /sec. per million lightyears , which at that time was still thought to be correct , that the universe as such was barely 2,000 million years old . This then was the state of affairs around the year 1935 . Fifteen years later , Walter Baade reported on Galaxies Present Day Problems and in his writings outlined the developments which had taken place . In the 25 years which have elapsed since the extragalactic nature of the spiral nebula was established the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most remarkable manner . It all started normally enough . Through the discovery of Cepheids in these systems their stellar composition became firmly established , and subsequent investigations showed that like our own galaxy , star clusters , gas , and dust are mixed with the stars of these systems . But hardly had the first provisional data for a few of the nearest galaxies been obtained , when a great discovery , the red shift in the spectra of the nebula , diverted the inquiry into new directions . You all know what followed . The cosmological problem became the dominant question and a tremendous effort was made towards its solution . We know today that this bold first attempt ended in failure . The reasons of this failure are in part of a technical nature , as for instance the provisional character of the photometric scales used in this first attempt . There is no doubt that with the means now at our disposal reliable photometric scales will be available 66 THE REALM OF THE NEBULA. in the near future , although the requirements demanded by theory in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are not so certain any more , however , whether certain basic assumptions underlying this first attack are justified . . . . Altogether , there are good reasons to believe that solution of the cosmological problem is much more difficult than was thought some 15 years ago and that it may well lie beyond our present powers . Certainly , we will need much wider and better-secured foundations than at present before we can hope to erect big superstructures . ' The possibilities of the 100-inch telescope at Mt . Wilson had by now been exhausted , and any further advance depended on the new 200-inch Hale Telescope under construction at the Mt . Palomar Observatory ; in particular the definition of a new photometric scale for the faintest galaxies based on photoelectric measurements , and the measurement of red shift in the spectra of the weakest and farthest removed galaxies receding from us at velocities approaching that of light itself . The first revision of Hubble 's distance scale , which Baade announced at the Astronomical Congress in Rome in 1952 , had a disturbing effect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions , namely the existence of a single and universally valid Period-Luminosity Relation ' for Cepheid variables . Baade 's differentiation between two types of star populations meant that it was also necessary to differentiate between two kinds of variables , those of Population I and those of Population I I. The short-period variables , so called RR Lyre stars , which i n the Milky Way system occur mainly in the globular clusters , have periods of less than one day and are typical representatives of Population II ; on the other hand the long-period variables , classical examples of Cepheids , in the vicinity of the Sun belong to Population I. Classical Cepheids do also occur in systems with Population II stars , but they are on average approximately I.5 magnitudes , that is to say four times as bright as the typical Cepheids of the same period of Population I. The period ? luminosity relation which Shapley used for determining the distances of the globular clusters applies to stars // of Population II . The variables discovered in spiral galaxies by photometric means are , however , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus belong to Population I. Hence Shapley 's period ? luminosity relation gives the right answer in the case of globular clusters , that is to say the correct scale for the Milky Way system ; in the case of extragalactic objects , however , distances computed on this basis are too small by a factor of two . This means that Hubble 's scale of distances for the galaxies needed at least to be doubled . In the course of further investigations , it has become apparent that a distinction between only two types of stellar populations is inadequate , and fails to explain all the phenomena which the stars and star systems display . Later we shall discuss how , from about 1940 on , the idea of the evolution of stars and star systems gained ground , and how the age of a star or system plays an important role in many considerations . At this stage , suffice it to say that Baade 's differentiation between two kinds of star population on purely phenomenalistic grounds actually entails a continuous succession of stages according to age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a corresponding succession of curves with various zeros . The luminosity of a variable is no longer determinable solely on the grounds of period ; further criteria are needed which will indicate the age of the star concerned . In this way the method of determining distances through variables suffers a slight loss of reliability.The inclusion of other objects , as for instance novae and supernova , or globular clusters , as well as the question of age , led eventually to a further revision of Hubble 's distance scale . The effect of this on astronomical thought is shown by the following examples of distances considered for the Andromeda Spiral : figure Apart from an alteration in the zero point of the period ? luminosity relation , the revision of the photometric scale affects the // velocity ? distance relation insofar as the distances calculated from the apparent magnitudes of very faint galaxies are much too great . The numerical value of the Hubble constant , which shows the increase in the velocity of recession per megaparsec , was reduced from 530 km. /sec. in 1936 to 75 km. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe is nowadays taken as 13,000 million years instead of the bare 2,000 million years as thought in 1936 . If we now turn our attention to the structure of the system of galaxies and try to discover the laws which govern this structure , then the tendency to collect in groups or clusters is an important characteristic of the apparent and spatial distribution ; the number of systems to be found in comparative isolation in space is small . On average about five galaxies occupy a space of approximately 100 cubic megaparsecs . In a model where the galaxies are represented by lens-shaped objects with a mean diameter of 5 mm. , 400 such lenses ' would have to be arranged in a space measuring 10 x 10 x 10=1,000 cubic metres ; however , they should not be arranged uniformly at a mean distance of about 2.5 metres from one another . In order to obtain the real picture , the objects would have to be divided into perhaps two or three separate groups , each no more than half a metre in diameter , so that within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mm. apart on average , while in the void between the groups there would be an isolated lens ' here or there . In our earlier model of the Milky Way system , we spoke in terms of pinheads at distances in the order of 100 km. from each other , reducing to about 1 km. in the densest aggregations ; but here the picture is wholly different . I C the galaxies are separated by distances which are comparable with their own dimensions , that is to say relatively close to one another , then one can count on considerable reciprocity between the systems , in contrast to conditions within the systems themselves , where the distance from one star to the next is of quite a different order of magnitude . Deformation of a galaxy in consequence of the tidal effects exerted by neighbouring 69 I THE REALM OF THE NEBULIE systems can be such that portions are torn free , and streams of ' matter move from one system to another . Countless examples of such bridges of matter between galaxies are known , many of which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also thought that there was evidence for collisions between galaxies , though it is doubtful whether the photographs in question really do show galaxies passing through each other . The question of whether there exists a super system , whose elements are the galactic clusters , is one which still remains very wide open . There are certain indications in favour of the idea that the local group , together with several other galactic clusters , forms a part of a sort of super-galaxy which has the great Coma-Virgo cluster as a nucleus , and about which it rotates with a period ranging between 50,000 million and 150,000 million years . Equally open is the question concerning the inner structure of the clusters of galaxies , which display considerable variety both in their sizes and in the numbers of component members . At present we differentiate between four kinds , dependent on the number of components , the degree of concentration , and the regularity of arrangement ( spherically symmetric or cloud-like ) . It is possible that the different sorts represent different stages of evolution . A final question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , masses and luminosities of the galaxies , and their connection with other cosmic structures , in particular the connection between the series of elliptical galaxies and the globular star clusters . In 1944 Baade emphasised that between the smallest galaxies with diameters ranging from 800 to 1,000 parsec , and the largest globular star clusters , whose diameters are only in the order of 100 parsecs , there is a wide gap which is unlikely to be filled . In the meantime , however , as a result of a systematic study of clusters of galaxies Zwicky has discovered some dwarf galaxies containing no more than some thousands of stars , and measuring down to 500 parsecs in diameter . Perhaps the gap , to which Baade referred , will be filled in the course of the next few years . 70 6 ? The Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram It is something of a precarious task to try to describe solely in words something that is a pictorial representation of physical relationships , without being able to drive home the point with an appropriate line . It also makes great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not at all sure that I shall succeed in conjuring up the correct image . If the attempt proves successful , it will lead to a real understanding of the problems under discussion . I would suggest that the reader equip himself with pencil and paper , so that he may draw up the diagram from t he e description below . Let us begin by enumerating the concepts with which we shall be dealing : magnitude , colour and spectrum . We talk of stars of the first magnitude , and second magnitude , and so on ; by this we mean their apparent magnitudes , i.e. how bright they appear to be . The apparent magnitude is by no means a direct physical characteristic , because it depends in part on how far from us that particular star happens to be . What we need to know in order to distinguish the real radiation characteristics of the stars is the absolute magnitude , the actual luminosity , which is independent of distance . The measure for the luminosity of the stars is our own Sun ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars are compared . The luminosity of a star is in fact equivalent to the candle-power of a light bulb , only more so ; the cosmic candle ' is the Sun , equivalent to a 400 quadrillion-watt // bulb . The range of stellar luminosities is about as great as that between a glow-worm and a million candle-power searchlight ; in this comparison the Sun may be considered about as powerful as a fairly modest nightlight . In contrast to the apparent magnitude , the colour of a star bears a direct relationship to a particular physical state , namely the surface temperature . With an increase in this temperature the colour changes from deep red through yellow into intense white , and in the case of very high temperatures assumes a distinctly bluish tinge . The colour index ' of a star is the difference in its apparent magnitude in two differing wavelengths . With the help of the laws of radiation , it is possible to calculate the surface temperature of a star from the colour index . The colour or colour index of a star represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in starlight ; a detailed analysis of these radiations teaches us yet more . From two-colour photometry we can go on to three- or four-color photometry so as to obtain a more complete picture of energy distribution in the form of a continuous spectrum , and to determine the intensities of the lines which overlie this spectrum . The sequence of colours from blue through white and yellow to red denotes a series of spectral classes , which have been redefined and added to from time to time . The classification developed for the Henry Draper Catalogue of the Harvard Observatory is the version which was finally adopted all over the world . Each of the letters O B A F G K M is used to signify a certain basic type . The choice and sequence of these letters may seem rather haphazard , but they are the relic of a previous code in which classification was carried out according to the intensity of certain spectral lines , and identified with letters which originally ran in the normal alphabetical sequence . With increasing insight into physical occurrences the series was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . In this way some of the letters were left out altogether , while in other cases the alphabetical order had to be rearranged . In addition each of the letter classes consists of subdivisions numbered from 0 to 9 . The sequence can easily be remembered with the aid of a // mnemonic , which , so far as I know , originated with Henry N. Russell : 0 Be A Fine Girl ; Kiss Me ! ' ? Sometimes three further classes bearing the letters R , N and S are attached to the list , so that the mnemonic ends with the words ... Right Now , Sweetheart ' ( though some say the last word should be Smack ' ) . I propose to avoid using these fairly exact definitions so far as I can , and to try to confine myself to wider terms such as blue , white , yellow and red stars . To a great extent luminosity and colour are parallel attributes . Stars of a blue or white colour have the greatest absolute magnitudes , while the red are generally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an example , lie roughly half-way between these two . Colour goes with temperature ; the higher the temperature , the more intense the radiation . A closer study of the luminosities and the colours of the stars revealed to Ejnar Hertzsprung that not all stars of the same colour have similar luminosities , but that a few , especially among the red and yellow types , stand out on account of their relatively high luminosities . In two articles which appeared in 1905 and 1907 in Zeitschrift fur Wissenschaftliche Photographie under the title Stellar Radiation ' , he came to the conclusion that , if the stars are to be classified according to their colours , it is necessary to differentiate between two sequences : in the one , successive steps from white through yellow to red signify a regular decrease in luminosity from 100 to 1/100 , while , in the other , stars of all colours have luminosities of 100 . Hertzsprung expressed this in the following terms . The luminosity as an expression of the total radiation depends not only on the temperature of a star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines the specific intensity of radiation emanating from one square centimetre of the surface of the star . This value must therefore be multiplied by the entire surface area measured in square centimetres to yield the total radiation . Hence the more luminous yellow and red stars must have very much greater diameters than the Sun ; they are giants ' in comparison with the dwarfs ' which resemble the Sun . Ten years before Hertzsprung the British astrophysicist // Norman Lockyer had suggested , on the basis of purely theoretical considerations , the existence of these two sequences . Within the framework of his cosmogony they represent either ascending or descending limbs of stellar evolution . A few years after Hertzsprung , in 1913 , Henry Norris Russell correlated both the empirical discoveries and the cosmogonistic significance in the Giant and Dwarf Theory of Stellar Evolution ' . This marks the actual birth of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram with its double significance , firstly as the correlation between colour and luminosity ? in this form it is also known as the Colour ? Magnitude Diagram ? and secondly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that time the theory ( founded on Lockyer ) was that a star in its visible form began life as a red giant ; then became hotter through contraction , and so with diminishing diameter and rising temperature passed through the stages of yellow and white giant until it reached maximum temperature and luminosity ; from then on the star would begin to run down , as it were , since further contraction failed to yield enough energy to match that lost through radiation . In consequence temperature and luminosity would decrease and the star would become a dwarf . The double nature of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram as a graph depicting both state and evolutionary stage has not always been clearly recognised , and misunderstandings have thus occasionally arisen over what represents a theoretical tendency and what represents the results of observation . Let us concentrate chiefly on the empirical side of the question , that is to say on the Colour ? Magnitude Diagram , as a graphic representation of the various states , characterised through the two measurable values of colour index and luminosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs in the cosmos . In this two-dimensional diagram let us mark the sequence of colours ( blue , white , yellow , red ) from left to right along the horizontal axis ; these correspond to the temperatures of the stars . Down the vertical axis we mark the luminosities in descending order . The Sun , a yellow star with an absolute magni- // tude of 5 ( and a luminosity of 1 ) , is marked with a dot a little to the right and below the centre of the diagram . The discoveries made by Hertzsprung and Russell in the decade between 1905 and 1915 may be summarised as follows : From the evidence of luminosity , some of the stars are giants and others dwarfs . The luminosities of the giants are all about 100 and their colour makes little difference ; they lie in a band more or less horizontally across the diagram from left to right . In the dwarfs luminosity and colour run parallel ; in general we may equate the colour white ( temperature 10,000 ? ) with a luminosity value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , and red ( temperature 3,000 ? ) with luminosity 1/100 . Thus the dwarfs lie in a diagonal band from top left to bottom right of the graph . Giants are apparently much less frequent than dwarfs ; among the hundred or so stars in the immediate vicinity of the Sun there is , for instance , not a single giant . Similarly , the open clusters consist almost exclusively of dwarf stars , and only the occasional giant is to be found . Slight differences in the spectra of giants and dwarfs were first noticed by Adams and Kohlschutter at the Mt . Wilson Observatory , and led to the laying down of criteria for distinguishing between the two types , as well as providing the groundwork for a two-dimensional classification of stellar spectra , by adding either the letter g ( giant ) or d ( dwarf ) before the Harvard classification . In this way the Sun is classified as dG2 . These spectral criteria , whose physical origins we shall examine later , play a part in the photometric determination of distance as computed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude diagram , with its two branches , giants and dwarfs , was soon extended . Among the stars in Hertzsprung 's first list there is a white star whose luminosity is more than a thousand times smaller than that of a normal star , say Sirius or Vega ; it is the companion of the double star 02 Eridani . In 1914 Adams found the companion of Sirius to be another such white star of low luminosity . The high temperatures of these bodies as demonstrated by their 75 I THE HERTZSPRUNG-RUSSELL DIAGRAM spectra , and their low luminosities can best be explained if one assumes that their surface areas are very small ; their diameters must be less than one-fiftieth that of the Sun . However , it also means that , in the case of Sirius ' companion , a mass equivalent to that of our Sun is embodied in a globe of about the same size as the Earth . The density of matter in this white dwarf ' must therefore be between ten thousand to a hundred thousand times greater than that of water . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a thimbleful of matter from the companion of Sirius would weigh more than a hundredweight on Earth ? was definitely possible in the light of what was known about the structure of the atom , since , bereft of their electron shells , the nuclei of atoms could be packed more densely . The physicist talks in terms of degenerate or collapsed matter to describe this state . The gravitational field at the surface of a star consisting of such collapsed matter is so strong that the spectral lines would show a relativistic red shift forty times greater than in the solar spectrum . In 1923 , Adams was able to show that this was so in the case of the companion of Sirius . The existence of a new type of star , the white dwarf , was thus confirmed , and could be entered on the diagram as a third type of state , quite apart from the giants and normal dwarfs . The dots indicating the white dwarfs lie along a band parallel to the diagonal band containing the normal dwarfs on the side of lower luminosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , research by Shapley on the question of luminosity and colour in the globular clusters led to modifications in the field of giants . In contrast to the open clusters of the Milky Way system , in which the blue and white types of stars are invariably the brightest , and luminosity diminishes towards the red , the situation in the globular clusters is more or less the opposite . Here the red stars are brighter than the white , and there is a total absence of the blue type . On the colour ? magnitude graph of the globular clusters , the dots representing the stars of this category form a band from the top right-hand side of the diagram ( red stars of luminosity 1,000 ) running at a slight // angle down towards the left as far as the yellow stars of luminosity 100 , and at that point splits into two branches ; one continues horizontally to the white stars , and the other curves downwards to merge with the dwarfs . The characteristic difference shown in the correlation of colour with luminosity in the globular clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most telling arguments in favour of Shapley 's scale of the Greater Galactic system . It contains the germ of the idea which Baade was to develop twenty years later , the differentiation between two types of stellar populations . In the early twenties two questions were of paramount importance : 1 . Is the region of the colour ? magnitude diagram , which lies between the branch of the giants and that of the dwarfs , utterly devoid of stars , or are there some intermediate types , as for example red stars whose luminosity is equivalent to the Sun 's ? 2 . How broad are the two branches , that is to say what dispersion is there in the actual degree of luminosity among giants and dwarfs of the same colour , taking into account any observational inaccuracies which are likely to exist in the observed distribution ? In about the year 1936 statistical investigations into the motions of yellow and red type stars pointed to the existence of a class of sub-giants which fill the gap in question . In due course , spectral properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still debatable whether these stars should rank as sub-giants ' or super-dwarfs ' . It was at about this time that people began to question the appellation dwarf ' for the stars forming the diagonal branch , since there were no specific criteria for the white stars at the point where the horizontal branch of the giants cuts across the diagonal of the dwarfs ' , so that the stars of this kind could not be placed with any degree of certainty either in the one category or the other . Because of this dilemma a new term gradually came to be used , and so the // stars which form this diagonal branch are now always known as main sequence ' stars . The second question , which is one of cosmic distribution , was solved through precise photometry of star clusters ; a study of Praesepe with the astrograph at Gottingen ( 1935 ) yielded the information that all the stars which are definitely known to be members of this cluster lie on a single curve . Similar photometric studies of other clusters corroborated these findings , and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when plotted on the colour ? magnitude diagram , did not actually coincide , but instead lay side by side . This threw a new light on a suggestion made by Trumpler ( whom we have to thank for a vast general study of the galactic clusters ) in 1927 , namely that the clusters should be classified according to the form of their colour ? magnitude diagrams . Trumpler found that the stars of a given cluster only ever covered a part of the general colour ? magnitude diagram . In the case of the Pleiades , for instance , only the main sequence is occupied , but this stretches right up to the brightest blue stars , while in the graph of Praesepe the upper limit of the main sequence is with the white stars ; there are no blue stars in this cluster , but on the other hand there are a few yellow giants . The situation in the Hyades is similar . Whereas the first two decades had been devoted to the general consolidation of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram , the details of the diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the internal constitution of the stars and of stellar atmospheres began to enter into the argument ; astronomers began to sketch in lines on the diagram linking conditions of state which displayed some sort of common physical factors . In 1925 Russell calculated that , according to Eddington 's theory of the internal constitution of the stars , it would seem that the central temperature of all stars forming the main sequence was roughly of the same order , between 32 and 40 million degrees , and that the main sequence could thus be regarded as the isotherm of central temperatures . The significance of // this in the field of cosmogony becomes fairly obvious when one remembers that the release of energy through the creation of more complex atoms from hydrogen requires extremely high temperatures , such as can be attained only in the interiors of stars . In 1933 a young man named Bengt Stromgren , working on theoretical considerations concerning the chemical composition of stellar matter , in particular the hydrogen and helium content , arrived at the conclusion that , when stars with similar hydrogen content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form lines which follow the main sequence from the bottom right towards the top left and then turn to the right in the upper portion towards the giants . The lines of equal hydrogen content form a series of parallel curves ; a lower hydrogen content corresponds to a displacement of the curve towards the right-hand side of the diagram , in a direction perpendicular to the main sequence . The resemblance of these curves to the colour ? magnitude graphs of the open clusters implies that in these clusters one is dealing essentially with groups of stars having similar chemical compositions , and that Trumpler 's classifications , in which main sequences also show a sideways displacement on the colour ? magnitude diagram , are indeed groups with different hydrogen contents . The assumption that evolution in stars goes with diminishing hydrogen content seems appropriate ; furthermore it is a clue regarding the ages of the star clusters . Briefly , therefore , by 1940 , we had the following picture of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram in its primary function as a general graph showing the conditions of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milky Way system as stars ( figure 10 ) . There is the main sequence of stars which occupies a diagonal branch running from the top left of the diagram ( B-type stars with luminosities of 10,000 ) down to the bottom right ( M-type , luminosity 1/1,000 ) ; the width of this branch depends on chemical composition . The Sun is a star of the main sequence ( G-type , luminosity 1 ) . Above the main sequence there are the super-giants , giants and sub-giants corresponding to lumi- // nosities ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 , from 100 to 1,000 , and from 5 to 75 respectively . The super-giants cover the whole range of colours from blue to red , while the giants and subgiants extend only from yellow to red . Between the main sequence stars and the zone of giants and sub-giants there is a relatively empty area which is known as the Hertzsprung Gap . A- and F-type stars , with luminosities between 10 and 100 , and temperatures between 10,000 ? and 6,000 ? , do not seem able to exist as stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars of high luminosity ( especially the Cepheids ) happen to come within this range of temperature and luminosity . Below the main sequence there are three distinct areas . The yellow and red sub-dwarfs occupy a small strip parallel to the main sequence ; luminosities of these stars are about a third of those for main sequence stars of corresponding colour . The white dwarfs also lie along a strip parallel to the main sequence , but their luminosities are a hundred times smaller . At magnitude 1 are to be found extremely hot blue stars , such as occur at the centres of planetary nebulae , and novae in their quiet states before or after an outburst . Although there appears to be great diversity in the universe as a whole , the colour ? magnitude diagram shows that this is confined to fairly specific areas on the graph , particularly in differences shown by the graphs of the open galactic clusters and the globular clusters . The roughly qualitative distinction between two types of star populations , as introduced by Baade , takes this into account . Finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar populations ? open clusters , Population I , and globular clusters , Population II ? underline the fact that these two parameters , luminosity and colour , are not sufficient in themselves to allow a full assessment of the physical state of a star . What is needed is a third parameter , which gives a numerical value for some aspect of chemical composition , as for instance the hydrogen content . It became generally accepted that the chemical composition of the stars varied . // It was at this time that Bethe and von Weizsacker put forward the theory concerning the generation of atomic energy in the interiors of stars . This made it possible to explain the varying chemical compositions of the stars as a result of elemental changes brought about by nuclear processes ? fusion of hydrogen atoms to form helium and other more complex atoms ? in the course of their evolution . In addition , differences displayed by the graphs of individual groups could be used to determine the ages of the groups concerned . In the history of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more . The efforts of astronomers are directed towards tracing lines on the colour ? magnitude diagram linking stars of the same age . The main sequence is split into a succession of rows denoting particular chemical compositions . Attempts have been made to try to deduce an initial sequence ' of stars containing the original matter . It follows that the degree of displacement of the main sequence of a given group of stars relative to this initial sequence ' can be used as a measure of age . These manoeuvres with the concept of age are not without certain dangers , insofar as one tends to forget that the age of a star , or group of stars , or system of stars is not something which can be observed directly in the same way as magnitude , or temperature ; it can never be more than a theoretical consideration , or at most an apparent explanation of some observed phenomena . If the two parameters , colour and luminosity , are inadequate for making empirical distinctions between various stellar states , and a third parameter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age is not the one to choose ; far better to look to the spectrum to provide a numerical value which expresses the chemical composition . This is exactly what was proposed by Daniel Chalonge of the Institut d'Astrophysique , who demonstrated a relief model illustrating a three-dimensional concept of state in a symposium on the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram at the Astronomical Congress in Moscow in 1958 . His three-dimensional model replaces the two-dimensional colour // THE HERTZSPRUNG-RUSSELL DIAGRAM magnitude diagram . Hertzsprung himself , then 85 years old and still playing an active part in astronomy , was present at the demonstration , which became a triumph for the father of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram . 82 7 . Stellar Atmospheres In the minutes of the Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften of GotIi ngen , there appeared in 1906 an article by Karl Schwarzschild on The Equilibrium of the Solar Atmosphere ' . The article covered only a few pages , but it introduced the idea of balanced radiation , as well as the first physical explanation of the structure of the Sun 's outer layers . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena which had been observed : the decrease in the apparent brightness of the solar disc towards the limb , and the sharp outline of the disc itself . From this article grew theories concerning the atmospheres of the stars . The mathematics of this were explained in a comprehensive paper by Schwarzschild which is recorded in the minutes of the Prussian Academy of Sciences ( 1914 ) in Berlin and entitled On Diffusion and Absorption in the Solar Atmosphere . 1938 saw the publication of a book by Albrecht Unsold , The Physics of Stellar Atmospheres ; the second edition of this ( 1955 ) contained 800 pages , and a bibliography which included as many as 2,000 titles , which shows just how much this field of research has grown . The whole idea is based on spectra and what they can tell us about stellar radiations . The spectrum of the Sun consists of a continuous background , which the human eye sees as that familiar band of colours , from red through orange , yellow , green , blue , and indigo to violet . Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are // atmosphere it has to pass through , and the more it is weakened in the process . If the atmosphere is to remain mechanically stable , then , at any given level , the weight of matter has to be borne by the pressure of the gas below . Because of this there is uniform decrease in density with altitude , depending on gravity and the molecular weight of the gas . Schwarzschild next brought a new theme into the considerations , namely that the Sun 's atmosphere must also be in a state of equilibrium so far as radiation is concerned ; this would mean that the stream of radiations passing through the atmosphere from below suffers no change in strength . Since this flow of radiations depends on temperature , this must decrease with height corresponding to the density , if the radiative balance is to be maintained . The radiation stream which passes through is characterised by the effective ' temperature ; according to the Stefan ? Boltzmann Law the intensity of radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy stream reaching the Earth , roughly 2 cal. /cm2 per minute , we can calculate an effective solar temperature of nearly 6,000 ? Kelvin . Schwarzschild 's simple model tells us two things about the Sun : in the first place it tells us that temperature and density decrease from the interior outwards , and secondly it yields a formula for the darkening of the limb , that is to say the diminishing brilliance from the centre of the disc towards the edge . An effective temperature in the order of 6,000 ? K would entail a surface temperature of 5,050 ? K ; and the intensity at the limb is about two-fifths that at the centre . In this model , however , the upper limit of the solar atmosphere lies , theoretically , at infinity , but the decrease in temperature and density is so rapid , that in reality the edge of the Sun appears sharply defined . If the altitude is calculated from the level at which the temperature is 6,000 ? K , it is necessary to rise only 400 km. above this level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where the density is only one-thousandth that // named after Fraunhofer , who used them as demarcations of wavelengths . The most prominent of these lines he identified with letters of the alphabet . According to the explanations given by Bunsen and Kirchhoff , these dark lines on the continuous spectrum occur when the radiations emitted from a glowing solid pass through a layer of gas ; in fact , they occur in exactly those places where the spectrum of the gas would show bright emission lines . This reversal of the spectral lines , as it is called , forms the basis of chemical spectral analysis , and was first used by Bunsen and Kirchhoff in 1859 in a study of the Sun . The explanation of the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum as absorption lines led to the idea that the Sun is an incandescent globe ? whether this is solid , liquid or gaseous is immaterial at the moment ? which emits a continuous spectrum , and that this globe is surrounded by a gaseous mantle , which gives rise to the absorption lines . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly as soon as the Moon covers the entire luminous disc of the Sun ; the continuous background fades , and , in the places where the dark Fraunhofer lines usually come , there appear bright emission lines . The flash spectrum ' , as it is called on account of its rapid appearance , is , in fact , the spectrum of the gaseous surround . It is possible to distinguish three layers in the Sun 's atmosphere : the photosphere ' which emits the continuous spectrum , the reversing layer ' which gives rise to the absorption lines , and the chromosphere ' which is responsible for the flash spectrum . In the simplified model of the solar atmosphere which Schwarzschild described in 1906 , he suggested that the radiations emanating from the interior enter the bottom of the atmosphere with an intensity which is distributed equally in all directions ; is absorbed in its passage through the solar atmosphere and re-emitted , until it finally emerges from the surface ? only now , its intensity is different in different directions . The greater the inclination of the ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . A depth of 400 km. , however , represents no more than one two-thousandth of the Sun 's radius , i.e. half a second of arc . Consequently , the edge of the apparent disc of the Sun appears sharp within a tolerance of less than half a second of arc . Schwarzschild 's explanation is merely a first approximation . In order to get at the real facts , we must put aside the simplified assumptions . The first task is to solve a purely mathematical problem which is known as radiative transfer . The decisive steps in this direction were taken in the decade beginning 1920 . In 1929 , E. A. Milne gave the first comprehensive description in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society : The Structure and Opacity of a Stellar Atmosphere ' . Then in 1934 there appeared a book by Eberhard Hopf : Mathematical Problems of Radiative Transfer . Apart from the mathematical problem of radiative transfer , there is also the physical problem of the absorption coefficient , a decisive factor in radiative transfer . Atomic theory supplies the numerical values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from this one can calculate the mean absorption coefficient of matter found in a stellar atmosphere . In about 1925 the first data became available from which model atmospheres of different compositions could be computed . The structure and radiation properties of such a theoretical atmosphere in a state of radiative equilibrium are determined through 1 . The effective temperature , as a measure of energy flux ; 2. gravitation , which governs the mechanical equilibrium ; 3. the relative frequency of the various kinds of atoms , from which the mean molecular weight and the progression of the absorption coefficient with wavelength can be determined . As observational proof of the theory , both the limb darkening and the distribution of energy in the continuous spectrum may be cited . Measurements of the darkening at the limb will be of // use in respect of a decision in favour of one or other of the proposed models only if the falling off in brilliance can be measured accurately so far as the last I% of the solar radius is concerned , that is to say within a rim no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again and again attempts were made to take sample readings within small areas of the Sun 's disc along a chosen diameter , only to fail , because stray light and atmospheric disturbances blurred the outline of the apparent solar disc . During solar eclipses conditions are far more favourable , since at such times the Moon moves across the face of the Sun like a shutter ; it lies outside the atmosphere and is therefore able to mask the various layers one after another . Hence it was not until eclipse observations of the last ten years or so that results could be obtained which were sufficiently accurate to be of use in deciding between the various model structures of the solar atmosphere , which had been suggested at various times . From the energy distribution observed in the continuous spectrum of the Sun , it is possible to deduce the effective temperature , provided surface gravity and the relative frequency of the elements are known . In order to understand clearly what is meant by the adjective effective ' , we need to consider the various concepts of temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Planck 's radiation law for the ideal black body ' . Such a black body is one which completely absorbs all radiations which fall on it . It can be imagined as a hollow space enclosed on all sides by walls absorbent on the inside . Any radiation which enters through a small hole in the wall will be completely swallowed , because , even though the absorbing powers of the interior walls may not be absolutely perfect , any residual radiation which is reflected will strike another wall where more of it will be absorbed . Thus total absorption is effected , and none of the radiation ever re-emerges . In this sense the term black ' is not necessarily synonymous with dark ' , but means non-reflective ' . It is rather as if the whole of the hollow space is filled with radiations whose intensity and spectral distribution depend solely on the absolute temperature . The laws of 87 ii STELLAR ATMOSPHERES radiation formulated by Planck in 1900 show the relation between the intensity and the temperature of the black body , so that , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be worked out . Temperatures calculated on this basis are called radiation temperatures ' . Planck 's Law implies that in an ideal black body the radiation temperature can be calculated solely from the ratio of intensities of two different wavelengths ; there is no need to measure the absolute intensity , nor does it matter which two wavelengths are chosen . Astronomers now had at their disposal an equation for determining stellar temperatures . If the stars behave like black bodies , then their surface temperatures can be calculated from their colour indices ; the colour index represents the intensity ratio between two wavelengths . Astronomers now began to tackle the problem from this aspect , and in this sense they referred simply to the temperature of the Sun or a star , without qualifying the term . It soon became apparent that in reality conditions were not quite so simple . If one bases the calculation of the solar temperature on the total radiation , then with a solar constant of 2 cal. , one arrives at an effective temperature of 5,800 ? C. On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution in the spectrum , the colour temperature of the visible portion of the spectrum reaches a value of more than 7,000 ? , while in the short-wave region the temperature is less than 5,000 ? . Finally there is still the difference between the centre of the disc and the edge ; the colour temperature taken as a mean of the whole disc is several hundred degrees lower than at the centre . Which of these values should therefore be regarded as the temperature of the Sun ? In the case of the stars , a similar situation arose in the contrast between two series of spectro-photometric observations . One of these ? published in 1909 by Wilsing and Schemer of the Astrophysical Observatory in Potsdam ? consisted of the visual part of the spectrum , while the other , by Hans Rosenberg in Gottingen ( 1914 ) , concentrated on the photographic portion . // Rosenberg 's results for the white stars were very much higher , and for the red stars considerably lower than those of Wilsing and Scheiner . The temperature scale of the stars calculated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fact the ratio is 16:10 . Which scale , therefore , is the correct one ? An observation made by Johannes Hartmann at the Potsdam Observatory in the course of some photographic photometric studies of the spectra of hot stars pointed the way to a solution of this apparent contradiction ; he described what he had observed as a depression in the ultraviolet range . He found that the intensity distribution in stellar spectra did not match those of a black body ; Planck 's Law can not be applied to the stars . Despite the fact that in the interiors of the Sun and the stars conditions may obtain which will permit genuine black radiation of a certain temperature to be generated , these radiations are modified in their passage through the outer layers ; hence the energy curve becomes distorted on emergence from the photosphere . The task of an exact theory of stellar atmospheres is to determine the amount of distortion . This then was the situation in about 1915 , when the theory of stellar atmospheres was still in its infancy . The urgency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers that the temperatures are of interest not just for themselves as a measure of a particular physical state , but they also play a part in determining other stellar characteristics . In accordance with the laws of radiation , it is possible to use effective temperature for calculating the energy which is emitted from each square centimetre of the surface in the form of radiation . If the total amount of energy radiation is known ( in the case of a star , this is equivalent to the true luminosity ) , and the temperature ( that is to say , the surface brilliance ) , it is possible to calculate the area of the radiating surface , and from this the radius of the star can be found . If then the mass of the star is also known we can calculate the mean density of the matter from which the star is composed . Next to temperature , density is probably the most important physical factor , for it tells us 89 namely whether it is likely to be gaseous , liquid or solid . From the stellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated the radii of the stars concerned , among them some of giants . A young astronomer at the Berlin Observatory named Bernewitz used the same temperatures to calculate the densities of binaries and , in this way , stumbled on a high density for the companion to Sirius in 1921 . When he tabulated his results , he marked the entry with two bold question marks , and added the note that one could arrive at a sensible ' result only if one ascribed to this star a very much lower temperature than its observed spectrum ( Harvard Classification A ) would suggest . If the temperature were 2,000 ? instead of 10,000 ? , the density value would sink from 88,000 , as calculated , to 5 . This state of affairs at the beginning of the twenties posed a twofold question for observation and theory : 1 . Exact measurement of the distribution of absolute intensity in the continuous spectrum of the Sun and of stars of all spectral types over the broadest possible range of wavelengths. 2 . Calculating the theoretical spectra of model atmospheres having various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important point with regard to the second task , the need to develop a comprehensive theory of stellar atmospheres going beyond Schwarzschild 's approximation . On the specific problem of the theoretical spectrum there are a few points relating to historical background that I would like to add at this stage . The relative spectral intensity distribution , that is to say , the shape of the energy curve over the wavelengths , is determined to a considerable extent by the range of the continuous absorption coefficient ; the latter can be calculated from the atomic absorption coefficients according to the relative abundance of the various kinds of atoms which constitute the atmosphere . The characteristics of hydrogen dominate the spectra of hot // something about the material of which the star is composed , STELLAR ATMOSPHERES stars . Moreover , the hydrogen atom , which consists of a nucleus and only one electron , is a comparatively simple subject for the theory of atomic absorption coefficients . Hence it is hardly surprising that the first theoretical spectra of stellar atmospheres should be calculated on the basis of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named McCrea , who studied at Gottingen at the beginning of the thirties . These calculations began to shed some light on the differences between the temperature scales of Wilsing on the one hand and Rosenberg on the other . A little later , Anton Pannekoek in Amsterdam and Albrecht Unsold in Kiel published their results of calculations , in which the admixture of atoms other than hydrogen ? collectively described as metals ' ? was taken into account . These calculations varied according to the percentage of heavy atoms assumed to be present . Whereas Unsold assumed the ratio of hydrogen to metals to be 50 : 1 , Pannekoek suggested that there was a considerable preponderance of hydrogen in comparison to heavier atoms in the ratio of 1,000 : 1 . Which particular relation between colour temperatures ( deduced from various sections of the continuous spectrum ) and effective temperatures gives a more reliable picture of conditions could not be decided with the spectro-photometric evidence then available . The question of the relative frequency of hydrogen is one to which we shall return in connection with the internal constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that from about 1935 on there has been increasing evidence in favour of Pannekoek 's higher value for the ratio of hydrogen to metals . Rupert Wildt 's ideas on the mechanism of absorption plays an important part ; these are founded on the discovery of the negative hydrogen ion ( 1939 ) , and the positive molecular ion of hydrogen ( 1947 ) . Hence it is possible to calculate that portion of the absorption coefficient which Unsold attributed to the metals . In 1940 Bengt Stromgren postulated his first theoretical model of the solar atmosphere , basing his calculations on the proportions in which the various atomic types were present . His // assumptions concerning the composition of the absorption coefficient were obviously fairly accurate , and provided a satisfactory description of the continuous spectrum . Since that time a number of further calculations have been carried out with slight variations in the basic assumptions and by different methods ; as a result a growing number of atmospheric models of all spectral types is now available . Spectro-photometric observations were developed along with the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of observations , which were taken in hand in various places during the twenties , to try to determine the temperatures of the stars from the continuous spectrum , there were two especially significant contributions for testing the theory and for providing a means of deducing an absolute stellar temperature scale . In the Gottingen Temperature Programme ' a fundamental system of thirty-six stars was achieved , and since 1940 this has been used extensively to integrate other stars into the scale of stellar temperatures . An improved system based on more recent photo-electric data should shortly appear . In Paris , a programme was undertaken by Barbier and Chalonge , which was at first concerned primarily with the investigation of the ultraviolet part of stellar spectra . Since the start of this programme its scope has been considerably widened by extending research into the realm of the longer wavelengths , and by the inclusion of stars of every conceivable type . From these investigations there emerged the three-dimensional classification of stellar spectra proposed by Chalonge , which allows for the fact that the state of a stellar atmosphere can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , gravity , and the relative frequency of component atoms . By comparing the results of observation with theory a somewhat unsatisfactory situation arose in about 1955 . In the continuous spectra of B and A type stars deviations were noticed which the existing theory was unable to explain . However , thanks to greater accuracy of the photo-electric observing methods , as compared with the photographic-photometric methods , a solution to the problem is in sight . The apparent // anomalies probably result from a combination of systematic errors , which occur partly through faulty assessment of the photographic plates , and partly through the blurring of absorption lines consequent upon insufficient spectral resolution . This brings us to a point which plays a decisive role when observed and theoretical spectra are compared . It hinges on the question of how genuine and accurate a continuum can be achieved through observation , and whether the actual observational spectrum is generally identical with the ideal spectrum , whose intensity distribution is based on theory . So far , we have ignored the absorption lines which form a part of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In observation they make it difficult to record an undisturbed continuum between the lines if there is insufficient spectral resolution ; in the theory , they necessitate the introduction of corrections which will allow for changes through absorption in the radiation flux . Both these factors , the correction through lack of spectral resolution , and revision of the theory , presuppose a knowledge of the intensities of these lines and their distribution through the spectrum . In order to achieve a comprehensive theory of stellar atmospheres , it has become necessary to supplement the theory of the continuous spectrum by means of a theory concerning absorption lines . To deal with this aspect would , however , require a complete chapter on its own account , and goes well outside the scope of what I have tried to outline here . I shall have to content myself with the remark that the theory of stellar atmospheres , so far as it concerns the interpretation of continuous spectra and absorption lines , is nevertheless sufficiently comprehensive to provide significant data , in particular the effective temperature , which will describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 93 8 ? The Internal Constitution of the Stars In the volume entitled Physics of the Cosmos of the textbook on physics by Muller-Pouillet ( 1928 ) , there is a chapter called The Stars as Radiating Gaseous Bodies ' . At the time , I wrote in the introduction : That we can nowadays talk in terms of the thermodynamics of the stars is due to the development which has taken place in astronomy during the last two decades under the influence of an increasing number of physical considerations . The way had , of course , already been paved , and it would be unfair not to remember the valuable contributions made to theoretical astrophysics by Helmholtz , J. H. Lane , A. Ritter , W. Thomson , and others . Meanwhile , one would not be far wrong if one were to regard as the beginning of this new development Schwarzschild 's short discourse ( 1906 ) On the Equilibrium of the Solar Atmosphere , in which the concept of radiative equilibrium was first mentioned in astronomical literature . The book Gaskugeln by R. Emden , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as dealing exclusively with convective equilibrium , but this in no way detracts from its importance , since more recently it has formed the basis for new lines of investigation . ' Every star is a radiating sphere of gas ' ? this apparently simple answer to the question of what is meant by a star , hides a host of problems . Schwarzschild 's hypothesis applies only to the outer shell , the Sun 's atmosphere . Eddington went further : he considered the // star as a whole . His first work On the Radiative Equilibrium of the Stars was published in 1916 , and his second The Internal Constitution of the Stars in 1926 . The following words from the foreword epitomise the situation . The book was written between May 1924 and November 1926 . Time was occupied by a number of minor investigations , made to fill the gaps that disclosed themselves as material was brought together . Anyone writing on a theme which many workers are actively investigating is liable to find his pen unable to overtake the rate of growth of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution in the Monthly Notices alone amounted to more than 400 pages . It has been still more difficult to cope with modifications and progress in the theory of the atom , on which astronomical developments must rest . As we go to press a " new quantum theory " is arising which may have important reactions on the stellar problem when it is fully developed . ' The stars are spheres of gas in a state of radiative balance . What does this statement imply ? In the interior of a star , mechanical equilibrium exists so long as the material particles are immobile , neither sinking towards the centre , nor rising towards the surface . Thermal equilibrium exists , so long as no region of the interior undergoes a unilateral change of temperature , and radiative equilibrium exists if the energy absorbed by a given volume of matter is equal to that which it radiates . If we wish to apply these concepts of equilibrium to the problem of the interiors of stars , then we must consider what are the forces which determine mechanical equilibrium , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Heat , we know , can be transferred by conduction , convection and radiation . When one end of a metal rod is heated , the heat energy travels along the length of the rod ; if the heat source is working continuously , the heat in the rod will begin to balance itself out with a certain temperature gradient from one end to the other .. When a heater warms the air in a room , heat is conducted to a thin layer of air which is in immediate contact with the heating // surface . The heated air expands and rises , and so a convection current sets in . In this way warmed masses of air are able to reach other parts of the room , and there is a continual mixing of warm and cool air masses . Here there is also a state of balance with a steady decrease in temperature in all directions away from the heater . For obvious reasons , this kind of equilibrium is called convective . The gaseous spheres of the classical theory , as they are described in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium . However , the heater also radiates heat , and in this way transfers heat energy to more distant places without necessarily warming the intervening air masses to any appreciable extent . In a room heated by means of ceiling radiators a sort of radiative equilibrium can occur , with a vertical temperature gradient of stable horizontal layers of air . The stars are gaseous spheres ' . One can demur at the idea of describing the state of matter in the interior of the Sun as a gas , if one remembers that the mean density of solar material is rather higher than that of water . But since the work of Hertzsprung and Russell , we know that some of the stars are giants in which the density of matter is very much less than that of the air of our atmosphere . So far as these stars are concerned , therefore , the gas-sphere idea can be said to apply . Even Eddington considered and intended his theory to apply solely to the giants ; for the Sun and all stars of the main sequence , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state other than that of an ideal gas would apply . It was only from about 1923 onwards that it became at all clear that matter in the interiors of the stars , despite the high density , does , in fact , behave like an ideal gas , and also why this is so . The characteristics of the gaseous state include the fact that the distances between the atoms are considerably greater than the diameters of their electron shells . Consequently the atoms are free to move ; the resistance which a given quantity of the gas offers to any reduction in volume ( i.e. an increase in pressure ) depends on the energy with which the atoms in their movement impinge on one another and on the walls of the container . // The kinetic theory provides the link between pressure , temperature and density in the form of an equation of state ' , so that , if two of the factors are known , the third can be calculated . A material constant comes into this equation of state , and this is characteristic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , and is the mass of the smallest natural particle of that gas ( molecule , atom , or even only a part of an atom ) expressed in terms of the mass of a hydrogen atom . The structure of gaseous globes varies with molecular weight . What , then , is the state of matter in the interiors of the stars , where we may anticipate temperatures of many millions of degrees ? At such temperatures the atoms collide so violently , that they become more or less completely denuded of their electron shells ; the physicist refers to this process as ionisation ' . The number of electrons which surround the atomic nucleus increases as the atomic weight ' of the substance . Oxygen , whose atomic weight is 16 , has 8 electrons ; calcium , whose atomic weight is 40 , has 20 ; iron , with an atomic weight of 56 , has 26 electrons ; uranium , atomic weight 238 , has 92 electrons . In the lighter elements the atomic weight is equivalent to twice the number of electrons , whereas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of electrons . When the bond , which holds the electrons and the nucleus of an atom together , is broken , and these components are free to move independently , the gas changes its character . The ' molecules ' , if we may retain this term for the smallest particles ? in this case , bare nuclei and electrons ? are millions of times smaller in diameter than when the electron shells are intact . Consequently they are able to pack more densely before they lose their mobility through contact with other particles . In a given volume of such quasi-molecules , electrons far outnumber the occasional stripped nuclei , though almost the entire mass is concentrated in the latter . Let us try to imagine a Sun which is composed entirely of oxygen , which has an atomic weight of 16 ; each atom consists of eight electrons and one nucleus , making nine components in all , among whom the mass of the oxygen atom ( 16 ) is distributed . THE INTERNAL CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS This means that the mean molecular weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value for iron is 2.1 ( mass 56 , number of components 27 ) , and if the Sun were composed entirely of uranium , its molecular weight would be 2.6 ( mass 238 , number of components 93 ) . Only for hydrogen and helium is the mean molecular weight markedly below a value of 2 under conditions of complete ionisation : hydrogen 0.5 ( mass 1 , number of components 2 ) , helium 1.3 ( mass 4 , number of components 3 ) . Thus matter in the interiors of stars exists in a very simple form . The wide range of atomic weights of non-ionised elements , from hydrogen ? 1 to uranium ? 238 , contrasts with the narrow margin for the electron gas , 0.5 to 2.6 , and this is reduced still further if neither hydrogen nor helium is counted , 1.7 to 2.6 . Although the presence of the various elements in the atmospheres of the Sun and other stars can be detected by means of their individual spectral properties , these tend to be largely destroyed under conditions which obtain inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically we are concerned with only two kinds of particles , electrons and atomic nuclei , which mix to form an electron gas ' whose mean molecular weight is approximately 2 , so long as neither hydrogen nor helium is present in any large quantity . This idea was first expounded in detail in 1924 by John Eggert , a photo-chemist , in a short article in the periodical Die Naturwissenschaften . Until that time , Eddington had been working on the assumption of a molecular weight of 56 , the atomic weight of iron , and in consequence had run into difficulties when comparing theory with practice . These difficulties were overcome once the value for the molecular weight in the equation of state was reduced from 56 to 2.2 , as Eggert had suggested . The electron gas inside a star is subject to intense irradiation ; this has the characteristics of genuine black radiation , so that Planck 's Law of radiation can be applied . At temperatures in the order of 10 million degrees , which are likely to be encountered , the maximum energy curve lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of the soft X-rays . According to the concepts // of quantum theory ( 1923 ) , the nature of radiation can be explained as waves , as well as corpuscular ; it is thus permissible to regard the radiation field in the interior of a star as a gas , whose component molecules are energetic X-ray quanta . This photon gas ' behaves exactly like an ideal gas , having a molecular weight , which may be calculated from its radiation energy by means of the mass-energy equation . Just as in the case of a normal gas , therefore , it is possible , by means of temperature and density , to calculate the pressure of the photon gas ? the light pressure or radiation pressure . If hydrodynamic equilibrium is to exist in the interiors of stars , then the forces which act on a particle of matter must maintain a stable balance . These forces are gravity , which tends to draw the particle towards the centre , in other words the weight of the matter , and , opposed to this , the resistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two factors , the gas pressure of the electron gas , and the radiation pressure of the photon gas . The ratio , in which gas pressure and radiation pressure contribute towards the support of the weight of the material particles , is represented by a new factor which Eddington introduced into the theory of the internal constitution of the stars . It depends on the mass of the star and on the molecular weight of the matter of which the star is composed . So far as the equilibrium of heat in the star 's interior is concerned , conduction and convection play no appreciable roles ; the transfer of heat from the interior to the exterior is entirely effected through radiation . Hence , the structure of a star in a state of radiative equilibrium depends principally on the absorption coefficient of the stellar matter , since this governs the radiative transfer . In contrast with the atmosphere described by Schwarzschild , which is subject only to a constant radiation flow emanating from the interior , energy is also being released in the star 's interior . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether they are evenly distributed , or whether they are more concentrated at the centre , plays a part in determining the structure . In 1926 , in a lecture on Stars and Atoms , Eddington , always a // master of lucid and readily understandable explanations , described conditions inside the stars in the following terms : Imagine a confused jumble of atoms , electrons and etherwaves ? severely damaged atoms rushing around at velocities exceeding 100 km. /sec. , their normal complement of electrons having been torn from them in the hurly-burly . The lost electrons travel a hundred times faster , trying to find new resting places . Let us try to follow the path of one of these . There is almost a collision when an electron approaches an atomic nucleus , but then with increased velocity it hurtles past in a sharply curved path . Occasionally the electron takes a sideways leap along its path , and then goes rushing on with increased or diminished energy . After having lived through about a thousand narrow escapes , all within a matter of a thousand-millionth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent sideways leap than usual . The electron has been securely captured by an atom , but , no sooner has it taken its place , than an X-ray strikes the atom . The electron absorbs the energy of this ray , and immediately flies off to new adventures . And what emerges from this hurly-burly ? Very little . For all their haste , the atoms and electrons do not really achieve anything ; they merely change places with each other . The etherwaves are the only members of this society who manage to create anything of lasting value . Although they appear to be flying about indiscriminately in all directions , they do , on the whole , gradually work their way outwards . The atoms and electrons , however , are prevented by the force of gravity from reaching the exterior . Slowly the pent-up ether-waves percolate outwards , as through a sieve . The ether-wave travels from one atom to another , sometimes forwards , sometimes backwards , then hurls off in a new direction , and in the course of all this it loses its identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be all that long ( say , between 10,000 and 10 million years or so , depending on the mass of the star ) before it succeeds in reaching the surface layers . As a result of the lower temperature of this region , it now changes its character from X-ray to light ray , though this is a gradual process involving a slight change // with every rebirth . At last it comes so near to the surface that it can make its escape , and wander through space for several hundred years or so without being disturbed . Perhaps , at long last , it will arrive at a distant world where an astronomer just happens to be lying in wait for it and having captured it with his telescope tries to wrest from it the secrets of its origin . ' For his first calculations Eddington lacked quantitative data both for the absorption coefficient as well as for the generation of energy . Like Schwarzschild in the case of the Sun 's atmosphere , he had to rely on some simple basic assumptions . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being ; it was difficult to assess how accurately his ideas represented the actual conditions inside a star with regard to the ranges of pressure , temperature and density at various depths . Even in this early phase of the theory , one general tenet emerged which is now known as the Russell-Vogt Theorem . This theorem states that the internal constitution of a star is uniquely determined through its mass and chemical composition . It is expressed in the Mass ? Luminosity Relation proposed by Eddington , which establishes the relation between the two empirical values , mass and luminosity , which can be obtained through observational means ; in this way it provides a means of putting theory to the test , provided that the mean molecular weight ( i.e. the chemical composition ) and the opacity ( i.e. the absorption coefficient ) are known and included in the theoretical considerations . In the decade from 1923 , during which time the new quantum theory developed , and gradually furnished astronomers with the necessary experimental and theoretical data , the following were probably the main points of consideration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permissible within the framework of certain limiting conditions , and differing assumptions as to the nature and distribution of the energy sources , including the effects of a possible rotation . The point-source model ' gained predominance insofar as the realisation prevailed that the only feasible energy source in the // interiors of stars which could be considered would be atomic , and that these sources could become effective only in the innermost cores of the stars under conditions of extremely high temperatures . 2 . The relative frequency of the elements which compose stellar matter , and in particular the amount of hydrogen present , which has an important bearing on the molecular weight of the electron gas . The theoretical mass ? luminosity relation can be satisfied by two divers assumptions for the hydrogen content ; for example , the mass of the Sun could consist either of one third hydrogen , or alternatively 99% hydrogen . The second of these assumptions seemed so improbable to the astronomers of the day that , even as late as 1932 , Bengt Stromgren had this to say on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation : The characteristic distribution of stars in the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram occurs because 1 . The majority of stars have a hydrogen content equivalent to one third of their masses , and therefore lie along the line of the main sequence and its extension into the branch of the giants , and that 2 . Large mass seems to be possible only where there is a high hydrogen content . ' The possibility that the Sun and also all the normal main sequence stars could consist predominantly of hydrogen was seemingly not worth considering . The realisation that almost all the matter in the universe exists in the form of the lightest atoms , hydrogen and helium , and that the heavier atoms constitute no more than an infinitesimally small proportion , began to dawn only in the next decade . In this first stage in the development of the theory of the internal constitution of the stars , which came into being through the introduction of radiative equilibrium and radiation pressure , the number of stellar models which fitted observations became more limited , insofar as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire interior of the star was homogeneous . A decision between the various models offered by theory was not possible on observational grounds so long as no linking factors regarding the composition of stellar matter were // available through independent physical data and astronomical observation . The dilemma was similar to that encountered at about the same time in connection with the continuous spectra of the stars . In this the relation between colour temperature ( which could be deduced from observations ) and the effective temperature ( the decisive factor regarding the state of matter in stellar interiors ) could also be determined by means of the chemical composition of the atmosphere , especially the relative frequency of hydrogen compared with the heavier elements . The choice lay between Unsold 's assumption ( 50 : 1 ) , and Pannekoek 's ( 1000 : 1 ) . In the years between 1930 and 1940 the ideas were born which were eventually to produce a concept of the internal structure of the stars which was to a great extent free from pure speculation . These ideas included : 1 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on quantum mechanics . 2 . Application of the quantum theory for analysis of the possible states of matter , and the formulation of the equation of state of stellar matter , which is designated either as normal or degenerate electron gas according to density and temperature . 3 . A quantitative theory concerning the generation of energy in the stars . In the introduction to his book Structure and Evolution of the Stars* Martin Schwarzschild , the son of Karl Schwarzschild , writes : A little more than a decade ago research on the stellar interior underwent a profound change . The central cause of this change was the introduction of nuclear physics into astronomy . Nuclear physics has provided the theory of the stellar interior with the last ? but not the least ? of the fundamental physical processes which determine stellar structure and evolution . Thus a new and far-reaching development in this field became possible . Simultaneously with this new theoretical development occurred an equally far-reaching upsurge in the relevant fields of // observational astronomy , an upsurge due largely to the introduction of new spectrographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened up an unprecedentedly wide front of contact between observation and theory in the research field of the stellar interior , in striking contrast with the situation twenty-five years ago , when there was only one major point of contact , the mass ? luminosity relation . ' Perhaps , at this point , one should mention the part which electronic computers have played since their introduction into this kind of work in about 1950 . With their aid it was possible to work out in a very short time numerous types of stellar models according to the various basic assumptions , and to compare these with the results of observation . If the idea that the generation of energy in the Sun and other stars of the main sequence results from nuclear processes , i.e. the fusion of hydrogen atoms to form helium , is correct , then it follows that , in the course of time , the chemical composition of a star undergoes a change . The hydrogen content diminishes and , at the same time , the interior becomes less and less homogeneous , since the fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicinity of the centre , where the temperature is sufficiently high . Consequently this region is the first to become depleted in hydrogen , so that , with the formation of central helium cores and rising temperatures , other nuclear processes will set in . By combining what the nuclear physicists have to tell us about the generation of energy with the mass ? luminosity relation , the ambiguity concerning the hydrogen content of stellar matter ? either about 30% or else 99% in the case of the Sun ? is resolved . However , since the proportion of helium present in stellar matter now enters the calculations , the theory can not commit itself further than to say that hydrogen and helium together account for more than 95% of a star 's matter ; the exact ratio in which they stand remains uncertain . Assuming that the relative abundance of the heavier atoms in the interior is about the same as that of the star 's atmosphere , the composition of which can be ascertained from analysis of the spectrum , the // values appropriate to the observed metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy . In the Sun the proportions of hydrogen : helium : metals = 70 : 26 : 4 . An important point arises in this connection , namely that there is a certain amount of latitude in the assumed proportion of heavy atoms . A ratio of 1 : 10 has but little effect on the range of temperatures , densities and pressures in the interior . The theoretical central temperatures lie between 15 and 17 million degrees , and the densities between 127 and 132 ; the differences are thus no more than a few per cent . The inclusion in the deliberations of models which are not homogeneous led to an understanding of the giant stars , whose very large diameters had , up to then , posed certain theoretical difficulties ; they did not fit the empiric mass ? luminosity relation designed for the main sequence stars . According to the new theory , however , they were regarded as stars with isothermic helium cores , in which helium , at temperatures ranging between 40 and 50 million degrees , forms the reactor fuel . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the equation of state of degenerate matter has made it possible to theorise about the white dwarfs with authenticated densities of 100,000 or more , so that nowadays we have plausible models for this part of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram . This phase of the theory concerning the internal structure of the stars culminated in about 1957 in a rewording of the main principle . Instead of the statement : The state of a star is determined by its mass and chemical composition ' , we now have The present state of a star is determined by its mass , its original chemical composition and its age ' . This summary by Martin Schwarzschild represents the key to the riddles of cosmogony , and to the understanding of the Hertzsprung ? Russell Diagram as a graph of stellar evolution . 105
