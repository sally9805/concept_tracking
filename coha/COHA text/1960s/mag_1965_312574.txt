The address on the Avenue Georges V is among the best in Paris , but once a customer goes down the flight of red concrete steps and through the swinging doors , another world surrounds him . Staring flintily out over the dance floor is a large , yellowed portrait of Chief Crazy Horse of the Sioux nation , and near the black bar are protruding long-handled steer horns . And on the minuscule stage are some of the most majuscule nudes in the world . <P> This is Le Crazy Horse Saloon , a Paris landmark now celebrating its tenth anniversary as a strip joint . The place nightly draws 250 eager customers-better than half of them foreigners-who with mixed emotions gradually discover that they have come to a place that refuses to take seriously either sex , itself , or its customers . Everything about the place is parody except the prices : the first drink costs $7 , the second $3 . <P> Bertha , Bettina &; Dodo . It is owned and operated by Alain Bernardin , a successful restaurateur who decided to branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dcor . Although he had never visited the U.S. , he went to see a dozen western films , all of them by Universal Pictures . " They always had saloons in those films , and since they always had the same set , it was always the same saloon , " he recalls . " I copied it for mine . " But business dragged , so Bernardin decided to enliven it with striptease . Again he haunted the cinema and found all the pointers he needed in a 42nd Street special called Dancers of Desire . <P> Today Bernardin scouts all Europe for talent , preferring Poles above all others , and he rechristens each one in his own high style . His present girls include Neferzouzou , Bertha von Paraboum , Bettina Uranium , Nadia Safari , Victoria Nankin , Natasha von Turmanov , Coral Lazuli and Sofia Palladium . Among the alumnae are Lili Lapudeur , Rapha Temporel and Bernardin 's alltime favorite , a Polish-German named Dodo d'Hambourg . <P> As Bernardin has choreographed their acts , there is not much actual stripping at Le Crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls appear already bare . Nadia Safari , for example , wears a widely spaced net sarong and lies in a hammock under streaked gold and black lighting that is supposed to suggest the primordial jungle . Crazy Horse girls are , in the main , above bumping and grinding . Lighting is everything , and Bernardin refers to his dozens of tiny spotlights collectively as " my brush . " <P> Middle Line-Bumpers . " I suppress eroticism , " he says . " I treat the nude as optical art . " Alluding to the Son et Lumiere spectacles that are held in summer at many of France 's chteaux , he says , " That 's essentially what we have here , but instead of illuminating Chambord or Chenonceaux , we play lights on Neferzouzou and Bertha von Paraboum.
