By last week the U.S. press , whose fondness for John Fitzgerald Kennedy is surpassed only by its capacity for advising Presidents , began to take a harder look at its new hero . What kind of man was the 35th President of the U.S. ? What was he likely to do in his first months of office ? More to the point , what counsel did he need from editorial writers and columnists ? From coast to coast , helpful , if sometimes sententious , comment poured into print . <P> The machine precision of Kennedy 's political strategy gave Columnist Doris Fleeson a sudden chill . " Efficiently , almost coldly , " she wrote , " President-elect Kennedy and his new team of intellectuals , investment bankers , management experts and bright young men are taking over their Washington assignments . But it is already clear that a fascinating and power-laden quality is sadly lacking-and that is personal fervor , with all that it means in warmth , excitement and flair . . . The art or trick of leadership is not just rational action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public 's heart as well as mind . Kennedy seems almost to have set for himself the Talleyrand motto : ' Above all , no zeal . ' " <P> Partly Cloudy . A paternal word of caution descended from the Olympian altitude where Columnist Walter Lippmann dispenses judgment . One of the more impatient pilgrims during the campaign , <P> Lippmann called for deceleration when the New Frontier hove into view . " The great task of quiet diplomacy , " said he , " is to work out ways and means of keeping the critical questions from reaching the point of irreparable decision . It sounds brave and dashing to say that we must take the lead and act decisively to solve the problems of Laos and Cuba . But the fact is that these problems are , in the present state of the world , insoluble . By open diplomacy , which only too often means loud-mouthed diplomacy , we can do little to assuage , indeed much to exacerbate these crises . " <P> New York Times Washington Bureau Chief James Reston saw the Presiden-elect as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy himself has had a shock . He has come to the conclusion that there was not only some truth in what he said in the campaign , but that the economy and the world situation are even worse than he thought . Accordingly , there is no longer any cavalier talk around Democratic headquarters about ' the first 100 days . ' Nobody is promising a flood of legislation that will make Franklin Roosevelt 's first 100 days look tame . " <P> While most press observers felt that the New Frontier was in sight , there was wide speculation about its climate and the style of its economy , and about a Frontiersman 's proper pace . The Kansas City Times studied the Kennedy task-force recession report and was reassured : " We have the impression that the New Frontier is to be approached warily . " The Reporter magazine called for the spur : " The men in the new Administration perforce have to be men of action . " Rowland Evans Jr . of the New York Herald Tribune 's Washington bureau filed a weather forecast on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with variable winds . "
