txt The Administration said today that it would seek to channel $300-million to $400-million more in the , next fiscal year into its new program to enlist business aid in reducing hard-core uneniPloptient ; The spending will be aimed , the Administration said , at more than 50 cities where the Government will seek the help of the business community to create 250,000 jobs during the next 18 months . The plans were disclosed by high officials explaining President Johnson 's statement last night that the Administration would make a major drive to place 500 ; 000 hard-core urban unemployed in jobs over the next three years . The President , in his State of the Union Message , said he would seek to raise Government manpower spending in the fiscal year 1969 , beginning next July 1 , to $2.1-billion from $1.65-billion this year . He said most of the increase would be used " to start a new partnership " with industry to train and hire the hard-core jobless . A Wide Range of Jobs The Administration officials said they expected a wide range of jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specific until companies came forward with definite proposals . They indicated they would press for jobs in manufacturing , retail trade and the service industries . Most disadvantaged workers receiving jobs as a result of the program would probably start in low-paying and low-skill positions because of their severe lack of work experience . This , in many cases in the past , has discouraged workers from continuing in such programs because they feel the jobs pay inadequately or offer no future . The Administration officials , who asked not to be quoted by name , said the program would involve a significant allocation of antipoverty funds to solve the urban jobless problem . But they said that there would be a reshuffling of money among several agencies ' and that the Administration would ask Congress for increased appropriations for ' some manpower and other programs . The officials expressed confidence that Congress would appropriate most of the money . needed for the program be- , cause of deep concern on Capitol Hill about urban unemploy-I ment . But other sources noted that Congress was decidedly , economy-minded and expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration officials said money would be channeled into the new program from the budgets of the Department of Labor , Office of Economic , Opportunity , Department of ' Health , Education and Welfare , Department of Housing and Ur'ban Development and other ' agencies . They said that new money would be sought mainly for the first three agencies and ( that the program would be run by the Labor Department 's Manpower Administration . Pilot Project Starting The President 's program , which will be sent to Congress in a special manpower message later this month , would encourage business to train and hire the hard-core jobless by provid- , ing companies with Federal money to meet the added cost of such efforts . This means it would basically be a vast expansion of a $40-million pilot project just getting under way in five cities , which uses the same approach . Most lof the Federal money is spent to pay for training , but it can ' also be used for transportation , ' day care and related expenses . ' The Administration officials said the new program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new jobs in urban areas by June 30 , ' 1969 . Existing Federal Iprograms concentrating on hard-core urban unemployment should create another 150,000 jobs by that time , they said , for a total gain of 250,000 to 300 , - ' 000 jobs . ' of money , the Government ' would pay a company for train-I ' ing each worker might vary from $400 to $5,000 , depending , upon the project involved . ' There were indications thel Government was willing to pay an average of about $3,000 . No Profit Incentive The Administration officials , said the Government would pay , companies for all the added : ' costs of training and employing ' ( hard-core jobless , but they said ; the companies should not ex-I pect a profit incentive . The ab-1 sence of such an incentive ' could be a major obstacle to ' substantial corporate participa- ' tion . Administration officials emphasized that the cost of training and employing the hardcore jobless was far greater than that involved in previous manpower programs because ! the individuals involved have particularly difficult health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even at a cost of $3,000 a worker , the spending would be less than , that required if the Government became " employer of last resort . " This is why the Government has lately been putting so much emphasis on getting busi ness to provide jobs for these disadvantaged .
