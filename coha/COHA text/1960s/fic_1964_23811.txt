Blood A story by Isaac Bashevis Singer The cabalists know that the passion for blood and the passion for flesh have the same origin , and that is the reason " Thou shalt not kill " is followed by " Thou shalt not commit adultery . " Reh Falik Ehrlichman was the owner of a large estate not far from the town of Laskev . He was born Reb Falik but because of his honesty in business his neighbors had called him ehriichman for so long that it had become a part of his name . By his first wife Reb Falik had had two children , a son and a daughter who had both died young and without issue . His wife had died too . But in later years he had married again according to the Book of Ecclesiastes : " In the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand . " Rob Falik 's second wife was thirty years younger than he , and his friends had tried to dissuade him from the match . For one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer . For another , she came of a coarse family and had a bad name . It was said of her that she had beaten her first husband with a stick , and that during the two years her second husband had lain paralyzed she had never called in a doctor . There was other gossip as well . But Reb Falik was not frightened by warnings or whisperings . His first wife , peace be with her , had been ill for a long time before she died of consumption . Risha , corpulent and strong as a man , was a goodhousekeeper and knew how to manage a farm . Under her kerchief she had a full head of red hair and eyes as green as gooseberries . Her bosom was high and she had the broad hips of a child-bearer . Though she had not had children by either of her first two husbands , she contended it was their fault . She had a loud voice and , when she laughed , one could hear her from far off . Soon after marrying Reb Falik she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bailiff who drank , and hired in his place a young and diligent one ; she supervised the sowing , the reaping , the cattle breeding ; she kept an eye on the peasants to make sure they did not steal eggs , chickens , honey from the hives . Reb Falik hoped Risha would bear him a son to recite Kaddish after his death , but the years passed without her becoming pregnant . She said he was too old . One day she took him with her to Laskev to the notary public , where he signed all his property over to her . Reb Falik gradually ceased to attend to the affairs of the estate at all . He was a man of moderate height with a snowy white beard and rosy cheeks flushed with that half-faded redness of winter apples characteristic of affluent and meek old men . He was friendly to rich and poor alike and never shouted at his servants or peasants . Every spring before Passover he sent a load of wheat to Laskev for the poor , and in the fall after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firewood as well as sacks of potatoes , cabbages , and beets . On the estate was a small study house which Reb Falik had built and furnished with a bookcase and Holy Scroll . When there were ten Jews on the estate to provide a quorum , they could pray there . After be had signed over all his possessions to Risha , Reb Falik sat almost all day long in this study house , reciting psalms , or sometimes dozing on the sofa in a side room . His strength began to leave him ; his hands trembled ; and when he spoke his bead shook sidewise . Nearly seventy , completely dependent on Risha , he was , so to speak . already eating the bread of mercy . Formerly , the peasants could come to him for relief when one of their cows or horses wandered into his fields and the bailiff demanded payment for damages . But now that Risha had the upper hand , they had to pay to the last penny . On the estate there had lived for many years a ritual slaughterer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beadle in the study house , and who , together with Reb Falik , studied a chapter of the Mishnah every morning . When Reb Dan died , Risha began to look about for a new slaughterer . Reb Falik ate a piece of chicken every evening for supper ; Risha herself liked meat . Asking around , Risha heard that among the Jews in the nearby village of Krowica there was a ritual slaughterer named Reuben whose wife had died giving birth to their first child and who , in addition to being a butcher , owned a small tavern where the peasants drank in the evenings . One morning Risha ordered one of the peasants to harness the britska in order to take her to Krowica to talk to Reuben . She wanted him to come to the estate from time to time to do their slaughtering . She took along several chickens and a gander in a sack so tight it was a wonder the fowl did not choke . When she reached Krowica , a villager pointed out Reuben 's but near the smithy , The britska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of poultry , opened the front door and went in . Reuben was not there but Risha looked out a window into the courtyard behind and saw him standing by a flat ditch . A barefooted woman Mr. Singer , who came to the U.S. from Poland in 1935 and joined the staff of the " Jewish Daily Forward , " has written many books of stories and novels , including " The Slave . " " Blood " will be in his forthcoming collection , " Short Friday , " to be published by Farrar , Straus and Company on November sixth . It was translated from Yiddish by the author and Elizabeth Pollet. - - handed him a chicken which he slaughtered . Unaware he was being watched from his own house , Reuben was being playful with the woman . Jokingly , he swung the slaughtered chicken as if about to toss it into her face . When she handed him the penny fee , he clasped her wrist and held it . Meanwhile the chicken , its throat slit , fell to the ground where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly and spattering Reuben 's boots with blood . Finally the little rooster gave a last start and then lay still , one glassy eye and its slit neck open to God 's heaven . The creature seemed to say , " See , Father in Heaven , what they have done to me . And still they make merry . " 2 . Reuben , like most butchers , was fat , with a big stomach and a red neck . His throat was short and fleshy . On his checks grew bunches of pitch-black hair . His dark eyes held the cold look of those born under the sign of Mars . When he caught sight of Risha , mistress of the large neighboring estate , he became confused , and his face turned even redder . Hurriedly , the woman with him picked up the slaughtered bird and scurried away . Risha went into the courtyard , directing the peasant to set the sack with the fowl near Reuben 's feet . She could see that he did not stand on his dignity , and she spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . When she asked if he would slaughter the birds in the sack for her , he answered : " What else should I do ? Revive dead ones ? " And when she remarked how important it was to her husband that his food be strictly kosher , he said : " Tell him he should n't worry . My knife is as smooth as a fiddle ! " ? and to show her he drew the bluish edge of the blade across the nail of his index finger . The peasant untied the sack and handed Reuben a yellow chicken . He promptly turned back its head , pulled a tuft of down from the center of its throat and slit it . Soon he was ready for the white gander . " He 's a tough one , " said Risha , " All the geese were afraid of him . " " He wo n't be tough much longer , " Reuben answered . " Do n't you have any pity ? " Risha teased . She had never seen a slaughterer who was so deft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense black hair . " Out of pity , one does n't become a slaughterer , " answered Reuben , and then added , " When you scale a fish on the Sabbath , do you think the fish enjoys it ? " Holding the fowl , Reuben looked at Risha in-tently , his gaze traveling up and down her body and finally coming to rest on her bosom . Still staring at her , he slaughtered the gander . Its white feathers grew red with blood . It shook its neck menacingly and suddenly went up in the air and flew a few yards . Risha bit her lip . " They say slaughterers are destined to be born murderers but become slaughterers instead , " Risha said . " If you 're so softhearted , why did you bring me the birds ? " Reuben asked . " Why ? One has to eat meat . " If someone has to eat meat , someone has to do the slaughtering . " Risha told the peasant to take away the fowl . When she paid Reuben , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hand was warm and her body shivered pleasurably . When she asked him if he would be willing to come to the estate to slaughter , he said yes if in addition to paying him she would send a cart for him . " I wo n't have any herd of cattle for you , " Risha joked . " Why not ? " Reuben countered . " I have slaughtered cattle before . In Lublin I slaughtered more in one day than I do here in a month , " he boasted . Since Risha did not seem to be in any hurry . Reuben asked her to sit down on a box and he himself sat on a log . He told her of his studies in Lublin and explained how he had happened to come to this God-forsaken village where his wife , peace be with her , had died in childbirth for lack of an experienced midwife . " Why have n't you remarried ? " Risha questioned . " There 's no shortage of women  --  widows , divorcees , or young girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a wife but the destined one had not yet appeared . " How will you know the one who is destined for you ? " Risha asked . " My stomach will know . She will grab me right here " ? and Reuben snapped his fingers and pointed at his navel . Risha would have stayed longer , except that a girl came in with a duck . Reuben arose . Risha returned to the britska . On the way home Risha thought about the slaughterer Reuben , his levity and his joking talk . Though she came to the conclusion that he was thick-skinned and that his future wife would not lick honey all her life , still she could not get him out of her mind . That night , retiring to her canopied bed across the room from her husband 's , she tossed and turned sleeplessly . When she finally dozed off , her dreams both frightened and excited her . She got up in the morning full of desire , a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 89 wanting to see Reuben as quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried that he might find some woman and leave the village . Three days later Risha went to Krowica again even though the larder was still full . This time she caught the birds herself , bound their legs , and shoved them into the sack . On the estate was a black rooster with a voice clear as a hell , a bird famous for its size , its red comb , and its crowing . There was also a hen that laid an egg every dog and always at the same spot . Risha now caught both of these creatures , murmuring , " Come , children , you will soon taste Reuben 's knife , " and as she said these words a tremor ran down her spine . She did not order a peasant to drive the britska but , harnessing the horse herself , went off alone . She found Reuben standing at the threshold of his house as if he were waiting impatiently for her , as in fact he was . When a male and female lust after each other , their thoughts meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reuben ushered Risha in with all the formality due a guest . He brought her a pitcher of water , offered her liqueur and a slice of honey cake . He did not go into the courtyard but untrussed the fowl indoors . When he took out the black rooster , he exclaimed , " What a fine cavalier ! " " Do n't worry . You will soon take care of him , " said Risha . " No one can escape my knife . " Reuben answered . He slaughtered the rooster on the spot . The bird did not exhale its spirit immediately but finally , like an eagle struck by a bullet , it slumped to the floor . Then Reuben set the knife down on the whetstone , turned , and came over to Risha . His face was pale with passion and the fire in his dark eyes frightened her . She felt as if he were about to slaughter her . He put his arms around her without a word and pressed her against his body . " What are you doing ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like you , " Reuben said hoarsely . " Let me go . Somebody might come in , " she warned . " Nobody will come , " Reuben assured her . He put up the chain on the door and pulled Risha into a windowless alcove . Risha wrangled , pretending to defend herself , and exclaimed , " Woe is me . I 'm a married woman . And you  --  a pious man , a scholar , We 'll roast in Gehenna for this . . " But Reuben paid no attention . He forced Risha down on his bench bed and she , thrice married , had never before felt her desire as great as on that day . Though she 90 BLOOD called him murderer , robber , highwayman , and reproached him for bringing shame to an honest woman , yet at the same time she kissed him , fondled him , and responded to his masculine whims . In their play , she asked him to slaughter her . Taking her head , he bent it back and fiddled with his finger across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reuben : " You certainly murdered me that time . " " And you , me , " he answered . 3 . Because Risha wanted Reuben all to herself , she determined to find a way to have him live on the estate . To keep a man just to slaughter a few chickens every week did not make sense and to propose it would arouse her husband 's suspicions . After puzzling for a while , Risha found a solution . She began to complain to her husband about how little profit the crops were bringing ; how meager the harvests were ; and how , if things went on this way , in a few years they would be ruined . Reb Falik tried to comfort his wife , saying that God had not forsaken him hitherto and that one must have faith , to which Risha retorted that faith could not be eaten . She proposed that they stock the pastures with cattle and open a butcher shop in Laskev  --  that way there would he a double profit both from the dairy and from the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impractical and beneath his dignity . He argued that the butchers in Laskev would raise a commotion and that the community would never agree to have him . Reb Falik , become a butcher . But Risha insisted . She went to Laskev , called a meeting of the community elders , and told them that she intended to open a butcher shop . Her meat would be sold at two cents a pound less than the meat in the other shops . The town was in an uproar . The rabbi warned her he would prohibit the purchase of meat from her shop . The butchers threatened to stab anyone who interfered with their livelihood . But Risha was not daunted . In the first place she had influence with the government , for the King 's overseer of the neighborhood had received many fine gifts from her , often visited her estate and went hunting in her woods . Moreover , she soon found allies among the Laskev poor who could not afford to buy much meat at the usual high prices . Many took her side  --  coachmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they announced that if the butchers did her any violence , they would retaliate by burn . ing the butcher shops . Risha invited a mob of them to the estate , gave them bottles of homemade beer from her brewery and got therm to promise her their support . Soon afterwards she rented a store in Laskev and employed Wolf Bonder , a fearless man known as a horse thief and brawler . Every other day , Wulf Bonder drove to the estate with his horse and buggy to cart meat to the city . Risha hired Reuben to do the slaughtering . For many months the new business lost money , the rabbi having proscribed Risha 's meat . Reb Falik was ashamed to look the townspeople in the face , but Risha had the means and strength to wait for victory . Since her meat was cheap , the number of her customers increased steadily and soon because of competition several butchers were forced to close their shops and one of the two Laskev slaughterers lost his job . Risha was cursed by many . The new business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was committing on Reb Falik 's estate . From the beginning it was her custom to he present when Reuben slaughtered . Often she helped him bind an ox or a cow . And her thirst to watch the cutting of throats and the shedding of blood soon became so mixed with carnal desire that she hardly knew where one began and the other ended . As soon as the business became profitable , Risha built a slaughtering shed and gave Reuben an apartment in the main house . She bought him fine clothes and he ate his meals at Reb Falik 's table . Reuben grew sleeker and fatter.During the day he seldom slaughtered but wandered about in a silken robe , soft slippers on his feet , a skullcap on his head , watching the peasants working in the fields , the shepherds caring for the cattle . He enjoyed all the pleasures of the outdoors and , in the afternoons , often went swimming in the river . The aging Reb Falik retired early . Late in the evening Reuben , accompanied by Risha , went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , while the animal was throwing itself about in the anguish of death , she would discuss with him their next act of lust . Sometimes she gave herself to him immediately after the slaughtering . By then all the peasants were in their huts asleep except for one old man , half-deaf and nearly blind , who aided them at the shed . Sometimes Reuben lay with her on a pile of straw in the shed , sometimes on the grass just outside , and the thoughts of the dead and dying creatures near them whetted their enjoyment . Reb Falik disliked Reuben and the new business was repulsive to him but he seldom said a word in opposition . He accepted the annoyance with humility , thinking that he would soon be dead anyway , and what was the point of starting a quarrel ? Occasionally , it occurred to him that his wife was overly familiar with Reuben , but he pushed the suspicion out of his mind , since he was by nature honest and righteous , a man who gave everyone the benefit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the father of all lust and cunning , tempted Risha to take a hand in the slaughtering . Reuben was alarmed when she first suggested this . True , he was an adulterer , but nevertheless he was also a believer as many sinners are . He argued that for their sins they would be whipped , but why should they lead other people into iniquity , causing them to eat non-kosher carcasses ? No , God forbid , he and Risha should do anything like that . To become a slaughterer it was necessary to study the Shulchan Aruch and the Commentaries . A slaughterer was responsible for any blemish on the knife , no matter how small , and for any sin one of his customers incurred by eating impure meat . But Risha was adamant . What difference did it make ? she asked . They would both toss on the bed of needles anyhow . If one committed sins , one should get as much enjoyment as possible out of them . Risha kept after Reuben constantly , alternating threats and bribes . She promised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he would let her slaughter , immediately upon Reb Falik 's death she would marry him and sign over all her property so that he could redeem some part of his iniquity through acts of charity . Finally Reuben gave in . Risha took such pleasure in killing that before long she was doing all the slaughtering herself , with Reuben acting merely as her assistant . She began to cheat , to sell tallow for kosher fat , and she stopped extracting the forbidden sinews in the thighs of the cows . She started a price war with the other Laskev butchers until those who remained became her hired employees . She got the contract to supply meat to the Polish army barracks , and since the officers took bribes , and the soldiers received only the worst meat , she earned vast sums . Risha became so rich that even she did not know how large her fortune was . Her malice grew . Once she slaughtered a horse and sold it as kosher beef . She killed some pigs too , scalding them in boiling water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught . She got so much satisfaction from deceiving the community that this soon became as powerful a passion with her as lechery and cruelty . Like all those who devote themselves entirely to the pleasures of the flesh , Risha and Reuben grew prematurely old . Their bodies became so swollen they could barely meet . Their hearts a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 91 floated in fat . Reuben took to drink . He lay all day long on his bed , and when he woke drank liquor from a carafe with a straw . Risha brought him refreshments and they passed their time in idle talk , chattering as do those who have sold their souls for the vanities of this world . They quarreled and kissed , teased and mocked , bemoaned the fact that time was passing and the grave coming nearer . Reb Falik was now sick most of the time but , though it often seemed his end was near , somehow his soul did not forsake his body . Risha toyed with ideas of death and even thought of poisoning Reb Falik . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , already I am satiated with life ! If you want , slaughter me and marry a young woman . " After saying this , she transferred the straw from Reuben 's lips to hers and sucked until the carafe was empty . 4 . There is a proverb : Heaven and Earth have sworn together that no secret can remain undivulged . The sins of Reuben and Risha could not stay hidden forever . People began to murmur that the two lived too well together . They remarked how old and feeble Reb Falik had become , how much oftener he stayed in bed than on his feet , and they concluded that Reuben and Risha were having an affair . The butchers Risha had forced to close their businesses had been spreading all kinds of calumny about her ever since . Some of the more scholarly housewives found sinews in Risha 's meat which , according to the law , should have been removed . The gent ile butcher to whom Risha had been accustomed to sell the forbidden flank cuts complained that she had not sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former butchers went in a body to the rabbi and community leaders and demanded an investigation of Risha 's meat . But the council of elders was hesitant to start a quarrel with her . The rabbi quoted the Talmud to the effect that one who suspects the righteous deserves to be lashed , and added that , as long as there were no witnesses to any of Risha 's transgressions , it was wrong to shame her , for the one who shames his fellowman loses his portion in the world to come . The butchers , thus rebuffed by the rabbi , decided to hire a spy and they chose a tough youth named Jechiel . This young man , a ruffian , set out from Laskev one night after dark , stole into the estate , managing to avoid the fierce dogs Risha kept , and took up his position behind the slaughtering shed . Putting his eye to a large crack , he saw Reuben and Risha inside and watched with astonishment as the old servant led in the hobbled animals , and Risha , using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the old man left , Jechiel was amazed in the torchlight to see Risha catch up a long knife and begin to cut the throats of the cattle one after the other where they lay . The steaming blood gurgled and flowed . While the beasts were bleeding , Risha threw off all her clothes and stretched out naked on a pile of straw . Reuben came to her and they puffed and panted . Their wheezing and the death rattles of the animals made an unearthly noise ; contorted shadows fell on the walls ; the shed was saturated with the heat of blood . Jechiel was a hoodlum , but even he was terrified because only devils could behave like that . Afraid that fiends would seize him , he fled . At dawn , Jechiel knocked on the rabbi 's shutter . Stammering , he blurted out what he had witnessed . The rabbi roused the beadle and sent him with his wood hammer to knock at the windows of the elders and summon them at once . At first no one believed Jechiel could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the butchers to bear false witness and they threatened him with beating and excommunication . Jechiel , to prove he was not lying , ran to the Ark of the Holy Scroll which stood in the Judgment Chamber , opened the dour , and before those present could stop him swore by the Scroll that his words were true . His story threw the town into a turmoil . Women ran out into the streets , striking their heads with their fists , crying and wailing . According to the evidence , the townspeople had been eating non-kosher meat for years . The wealthy housewives carried their pottery into the market place and broke it into shards . Some of the sick and several pregnant women fainted . Many of the pious tore their lapels , strewed their heads with ashes , and sat down to mourn . A crowd formed and ran to the butcher shops to punish the men who sold Risha 's meat . Refusing to listen to what the butchers said in their own defense , they beat up several of them , threw whatever carcasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon voices arose , suggesting they go to Reb Falik 's estate , and the mob began to arm itself with bludgeons , rope , knives . The rabbi , fearing bloodshed , came out into the street to stop them , warning that punishment must wait until the sin had been proved intentional and a verdict had been passed . But the mob would n't 11 : : en . The rabbi decided to go with them , hoping to calm them down on the way . The elders followed . Women trailed after them , pinchingtheir cheeks and weeping as if at a funeral . Schoolboys dashed alongside . Wolf Bonder , to whom Risha had given gifts and whom she had always paid well to cart the meat from the estate to Laskev , remained loyal to her . Seeing how ugly the temper of the crowd was becoming , he went to his stable , saddled a fast horse , and galloped out toward the estate to warn Risha . As it happened , Reuben and Risha had stayed overnight in the shed and were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and watched with surprise as Wolf Bonder rode up . He explained what had happened and warned them of the mob coming . He advised them to flee , unless they could prove their innocence , otherwise the angry men would surely tear them to pieces . He himself was afraid to stay any longer lest before he could get back the mob turn against him . Mounting his horse , he rode away at a gallop . 5 . Reuben and Risha stood frozen with shock . Reuben 's face turned a fiery red , then a deadly white . His hands trembled , and he had to clutch at the door behind him to remain on his feet . Risha smiled anxiously and her face turned yellow as if she had jaundice , but it was Risha who moved first . Approaching her lover , she stared into his eyes . " So my love , " she said , " the end of a thief is the gallows . " " Let 's run away . " Reuben was shaking so violently that he could hardly get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible . The estate had only six horses and all of them had been taken early that morning by peasants going to the forest for wood . A yoke of oxen would move so slowly that the rabble could overtake them . Besides , she , Risha , had no intention of abandoning her property and wandering like a beggar . Reuben implored her to flee with him , since life is more precious than all possessions , but Risha remained stubborn . She would rot go . Finally they went into the main house , where Risha rolled sonic linen up into a bundle for Reuben , gave him a roast chicken , a loaf of bread , and a pouch with some money . Standing outdoors , she watched as he set nut , swaying and wobbling across the wooden bridge that led into the pine woods . Once in the forest , he would strike the path to the Lublin road . Several times Reuben turned about-face , muttered and waved his hands as if calling her , but Risha stood impassively . She had already learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a weak chicken and a tethered ox . As soon as Reuben was out of sight , Risha moved toward the fields to call in the peasants . She told them to pick up axes , scythes , shovels , explained to them that a mob was on its way from Laskev , and promised each man a gulden and a pitcher of beer if he would help defend her . Risha herself seized a long knife in one hand and brandished a meat cleaver in the other . Soon the noise of the crowd could be heard in the distance , and before long the - mob was visible . Surrounded by her peasant guard , Risha mounted a hill at the entrance to the estate . When those who were coming saw peasants with axes and scythes they slowed down . A few even tried to retreat . Risha 's fierce dogs ran among them , snarling , barking , growling . The rabbi , seeing that the situation could lead only to bloodshed , demanded of his flock that they return home , but the tougher of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Come on , let 's see what you can do ! I 'll cut your heads off with this knife  --  the same knife I used on the horses arid pigs I made you eat . " When a man shouted that no one in Laskev would buy her meat anymore and that she would be excommunicated , Risha shouted back , " I do n't need your money . I do n't need your God either . I 'll convert . Immediately ! " And she began to scream in Polish , calling the Jews cursed Christ-killers and crossing herself as if she were already a gentile . Turning to one of the peasants , she said : " What are you waiting for , Maciek ? Run and summon the priest . I do n't want to belong to this filthy sect anymore . " The peasant went and the mob became silent . Everyone knew that converts soon became enemies of Israel and invented all kinds of accusations against their former brethren . They turned away and went home . The Jews were afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in his study house and recited the Mishna . Deaf and half-blind , he saw nothing and heard nothing . Suddenly Risha entered , knife in hand , screaming : " Go to your Jews . What do I need a synagogue here for ? " When Reb Falik saw her with her head uncovered , a knife in her hand , her face contorted by abuse , he was seized by such anguish that he lost his tongue . In his prayer shawl and phylacteries , he rose to ask her what had happened , but his feet gave way and he collapsed to the floor dead . Risha ordered his body placed in an oxcart , and she sent his corpse to the Jews in Laskev without even linen for a shroud . During the time the Laskev Burial Society cleansed and laid out Reb Falik 's body , and while the burial was taking a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 93 place and the rabbi speaking the eulogy , Risha prepared for her conversion . She sent men out to look for Reuben , for she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vanished . Risha was now free to do as she pleased . After her conversion she reopened her shops and sold non-kosher meats to the gentiles of Laskev and to the peasants who came in on market days . She no longer had to hide anything . She could slaughter openly , and in whatever manner she pleased , pigs , oxen , calves , sheep . She hired a gentile slaughterer to replace Reuben and went hunting with him in the forest and shot deer , hares , rabbits . But she no longer took the same pleasure in torturing creatures ; slaughtering no longer incited her lust ; and she got little satisfaction from lying with the pig butcher . Fishing in the river , sometimes when a fish dangled on her hook or danced in her net , a moment of joy came to her heart embedded in fat , and she would mutter , " Well , fish , you are worse off than I am . . . " The truth was that she yearned for Reuben . She missed their lascivious talk , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gehenna . Now that Reb Falik was in his grave , she had no one to betray , to pity , to mock . She had bought a pew in the Christian church immediately upon conversion and for some months went every Sunday to listen to the priest 's sermon . Going and coming , she had her driver take her past the synagogue . Teasing the Jews gave her some satisfaction for a while , but soon this too palled . With time Risha became so lazy that she no longer went to the slaughtering shed . She left everything in the hands of the pork butcher and did not even care that he was stealing from her . Immediately upon getting up in the morning , she poured herself a glass of liqueur and crept on her heavy feet from room to room talking to herself . She would stop at a mirror and mutter , " Woe , woe , Risha . What has happened to you ? If your saintly mother should rise from her grave , one look at you would make her lie down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her clothes would not hang straight , her hair could not be untangled . Frequently she sang for hours in Yiddish and in Polish . Her voice was harsh and cracked and she invented the songs as she went along , repeating meaningless phrases , uttering sounds that resembled the cackling of fowl , the grunting of pigs , the death rattles of oxen . Falling onto her bed she hiccuped , belched , laughed , cried . At night in her dreams , phantoms tormented her : bulls gored her with 94 BLOOD their horns ; pigs shoved their snouts into her face and bit her ; roosters cut her flesh to ribbons with their spurs . Reb Falik appeared , dressed in his shroud , covered with wounds , waving a bunch of palm leaves , screaming , " I can not rest in my grave . You have defiled my house . " Then Risha , or Maria Pawlowska as she was now called , would start up in bed , her limbs numb , her body covered with a cold sweat . Reb Falik 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the palm leaves , the echo of his outcry . Simultaneously she would cross herself and repeat a Hebrew incantation learned in childhood from her mother . She would force her bare feet down to the floor and would begin to stumble through the dark from one room to another . She was far from repenting but something inside her was mourning and filling her with bitterness . Opening a window , she would look out into the midnight sky full of stars and cry out , " God , come and punish me ! Come Satan , Come Asmodeus I Show your might . Carry me to the burning desert behind the dark mountains ! " 6 . One winter Laskev was terrified by a carnivorous animal lurking at night and attacking people . Some who had seen the creature said it was a bear , others a wolf , others a demon , One woman , going outdoors in the evening , had her neck bitten . A Yeshiva boy was chased through the streets , An elderly night watchman had his face clawed . The women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightfall . Everywhere shutters were bolted tight . Many strange things were recounted about the beast : someone had heard it rave with a human voice ; another had seen it rise on its hind legs and ram . It had overturned a barrel of cabbage in a courtyard , had opened chicken coops , thrown out the dough set to rise in the wooden trough in the bakery , and had defiled the butcher blocks in the kosher shops with excrement . One dark night the butchers of Laskev gathered with axes and knives determined either to kill or capture the monster . Splitting up into small groups they waited , their eyes growing accustomed to the darkness . In the middle of the night there was a scream , and running toward it they caught sight of the animal making for the outskirts of town . A man shouted that he had been bitten in the shoulder . Frightened , some of the men dropped back , but others continued to give chase . One of the hunters saw it and threw his axe . Apparently the animal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell . A horrible howling filled the air . Then the beast began to curse in Polish and Yiddish and to wail in a high-pitched voice like a woman in labor . Convinced that they had wounded a she-devil , the men ran home . All that night the animal groaned and babbled . It even dragged itself to a house and knocked at the shutters . Then it became silent and the dogs began to bark . When day dawned , the bolder people came out of their houses . They discovered to their amazement that the animal was Risha . She lay dead dressed in a skunk fur coat wet with blood . One felt boot was missing . The hatchet had buried itself in her back . The dogs had already partaken of her entrails . Nearby was the knife she had used to stab one of her pursuers . It was now clear that Risha had become a werewolf . Since the Jews refused to bury her in their cemetery and the Christians were unwilling to give her a plot in theirs , she was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the mob , and a ditch was dug for her there . Her wealth was confiscated by the city . Some years later a wandering stranger lodged in the poorhouse of Laskev became sick . Before his death , he summoned the rabbi and the seven elders of the town and divulged to them that he was Reuben , the slaughterer with whom Risha had sinned . For years he had wandered from town to town , eating no meat , fasting Mondays and Thursdays , wearing a shirt of sackcloth , and repenting his abominations . He had come to Laskev to die because it was here his parents were buried . The rabbi recited the confession with him and Reuben revealed many details of the past which the townspeople had not known . Risha 's grave on the hill became covered with refuse . Yet long afterwards it remained customary for the Laskev schoolboys , on the thirty-third day of Omer , when they went out carrying bows and arrows and a provision of hard-boiled eggs , to stop there . They danced on the hill and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil forces . A pig for an ox Sold Risha the witch Now she 's roasting In sulphur and pitch . Before the children left , they spat on the grave and recited : Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live A witch to live thou shalt not suffer Suffer a witch to live thou shalt not .
