 | ENTER GAMBIA , LAUGHING The Unusual Birth of Africa 's Smallest New Nation Africa 's smallest and poorest new independent nation is Gambia , a tiny enclave jutting into Senegal , on the West African coast . This fact may have escaped general notice , since little about Gambia is on a scale likely to attract attention . It has no railroad , no daily paper , one airport , and one cash crop ? peanuts . The capital , Bathurst , with a population of 28,000 , is its only city and only seaport . On February 18 , 1965 , when this former British colony achieved Independence , Bathurst had one hotel , no restaurants , one pharmacy , one bookstore , and one fire engine . Gambia 's 4,000 square miles , smaller than Connecticut , encompass 300 winding miles of the Gambia River , and a few miles of riverbank on either side . Since 1963 , Gambia 's 320,000 people have been under the moderate and capable leadership of Prime Minister David K. Jawara , * a quiet , bespectacled former veterinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers , a reasonably efficient civil service , and six Gambian Ministers , one of whom went beyond high school . Mr. Jawara , a Mandinka ( largest of the five major tribes ) , is also leader of the ruling People 's Progressive Party , which draws its support mainly from the up-river provinces . Opposing the PPP is the United Party , centered mostly in Bathurst , and led by a disbarred lawyer named P. S. N'Jie . About 85 per cent of Gambia 's Black African people are Moslem tribal villagers , who farm with a small wooden hoe called a " coop-coop . " So busy are they with their peanuts , that the government *He is now Sir Dawda K. Jawara . In the national elections this spring he won a resounding victory . has to import more than 8,000 tons of rice annually to feed them . Until Independence , industrial development consisted of two small peanut-oil mills . Since then , an Indian firm has built a small Coca-Cola bottling plant , and the people from Gilbey 's have begun bottling gin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggling cigarettes and transistor radios to Senegal , a practice known officially as " re-export . " The only natural resource in plentiful supply is fish , but Gambians have never been interested in fishing . Though the government 's revenues of $6.5 million a year run about a million behind expenditures ? England makes up the difference , plus another two million or so for development projects ? no one can accuse Mr. Jawara of extravagance . His administration makes do with a two-man foreign ministry , four-man foreign service , and a 150-man army . The Bathurst City Council meets about once a month in a crumbling World War II quonset hut , and Parliament gathers from time to time in the ballroom of the former British social club . Despite Independence , Bathurst remains distinctly British . Faded pictures of the Queen hang in nearly every home . Bathurst youths dressed in spotless whites still play cricket at MacCarthy Square . Bathurst elders still gather at the Reform Club to play darts , snooker-pool , and draughts , while downing pints of Tennant 's beer and Guinness stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never visited her colony , to call it " that dear , loyal little place . " Sir Richard Burton , who @#  | did described Bathurst as nothing but " mud , man : , roves , malaria , and miasma . " Today , however , Bathurst is one of the most pleasant cities on the coast . Though down-at-theheels , it is a charming , friendly town , brightened by frangipani , bougainvillea , and jacaranda , and it has none of the abject poverty or foul slums common to other West African capitals . During the seven-month dry season , the days are warm and the nights cool ? though up-river temperatures run to 140 in the sun . The summer rainy season in Bathurst is hot ( often over 100 ) with a humidity admitted by the British tourist guide to be " trying . " Until recently , no one ever expected Gambia to be a country at all . In 1661 , the first British settlers used it as a convenient trading post for slaves and other coastal products . In the nineteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with France for various parts of France 's African empire . The French refused . One former Governor called Gambia " a geographic and economic absurdity . " Just six years ago , a New York Times reporter wrote confidently from Bathurst that " Gambia could never stand alone as an independent nation . Everyone here knows this . " Despite such opinions , Gambia has become Africa 's 36th independent state , and the 115th member of the United Nations . When asked for his reaction to this event , one high-ranking British official told a recent visitor , " You ca n't really live in Gambia unless you have a good sense of humor . It 's a lot of fun , and it should be taken that way . " A Name , a Face As Independence drew near , the government busied itself in equipping the country with the usual accouterments of nationhood . It offered prizes of $140 each in contests for a national flag , a coat of arms , and a national anthem . Fortunately , it did not have to run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been The Gambia , give or take some variety in pronunciation as the Portuguese , Dutch , Spaniards , French , and English tried out the original African version . A problem did arise early in 1964 , when the administration learned that Northern Rhodesia , which was about to become independent , planned to adopt the name " Zambia . " Colonial officials in Bathurst wrote to Lusaka suggesting as tactfully as possible to officials there that they consider a different name , but the effort got nowhere . Ever since , mail for Radio Gambia has gone to Radio Zambia in Lusaka , and packages intended for Zambia Airways have wound up in Bathurst at the Gambia Airways office . The problem of invitations for the February celebration caused a good deal of turmoil because the normal delicacy of diplomatic protocol was compounded by Bathurst 's meager housing capacity . Its one hotel , the Atlantic , had only fifty rooms . " The trouble is , " said an official , " some of the African nations are not averse to inviting themselves , or requesting invitations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one delegate , but some of them have written back to say they 'll be bringing their wives , their secretaries , and other officials . Really , it 's impossible . " First in priority , of course , came Gambia 's fellow members of the Commonwealth ? from Australia to Zambia . Next came some of Gambia 's West African neighbors : Senegal , Mali , Mauretania , Morocco , Guinea , and Liberia . After these , the invitations seem to have been distributed with a hard look at potential sources of foreign aid ? West Germany , France , Israel , Italy , Russia , United Arab Republic , and the United States ? plus a glance at diplomacy : Ethiopa ( a leader in the Organization of African Unity ) ; Lebanon ( Gambia has a sizable Lebanese merchant community ) ; and the Vatican ( you always invite the Vatican to such affairs ) . Along with the Duke and Duchess of Kent , and a five-man Parliamentary delegation , Great Britain dispatched the Home Fleet cruiser H.M.S. Lion to show the flag . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . While the government was busy with official preparations , individual Gambians did ' what they could to get ready . Nearly every woman had to have a new dress , many of them buying the Gambian Independence cloth that began to flood the local market . This printed material , in a variety of gay colors , displays the benign features of Prime Minister Jawara , along with appropriate Gambian scenes and inscriptions such as " GAMBIAN INDEPENDENCE 1965 " or " PEACE PROGRESS PROSPERITY . " Men and women alike sported apparel made from this cloth . Upriver , crafty traders with unused stocks from Berkeley Rice , who was correspondent for " Newsweek " in West Africa , has written a book about Gambia , from which this article is adapted . It will be published next spring by Houghton Mifflin . In his research he was assisted by the Philip M. Stern Family Fund . Mr. Rice has studied at Amherst , Columbia , and the Sorbonne , and lectured at the Haitian-American Institute .  | previous African Independence celebrations sold grateful Gambian peasants dress material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaunda of Zambia , and the late Patrice Lumumba of the Congo . " You Know , People People " Reporters and photographers began drifting into Bathurst the weekend before things got under way . The " foreign press " consisted of correspondents for the Associated Press , Reuters , the New York Times , Newsweek , London 's Daily Express , Daily Telegraph , and the weekly , West Africa , plus camera teams from CBS and BBC television . The Eastern Bloc was represented by gentlemen from Czechoslovakia 's and Hungary 's state news agencies . Rumors circulated during the week that two men from Peking were in town but , if so , they remained well hidden . There were assorted correspondents for various African publications , and several Gambians of the local journalistic community . Since the Atlantic was already overbooked , the government arranged to house the press downtown in Madi Flats , a small , temporarily vacant apartment building . Byithe time the thirty-odd journalists had been crammed into it , the building resembled a pre-game college locker room . The Europeans and Americans soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch , and discussed events in the Congo and who had covered the most Independence stories . Several of the Africans who arrived late , and were given cots in the crowded outer rooms , made threatening noises about discrimination , but nothing came of it . Though Independence Day was not till Thursday , George Peters , the government Information Officer , called a press conference on the preceding Sunday afternoon . A jovial rotund teddy bear of a man , " Capt'n " Peters first came to Gambia early in World War II as a supply officer with the Royal West African Frontier Force ; he stayed on for twenty years spending most of his time editing the official thrice-weekly Gambia News Bulletin . According to local legend , he once brought fame to himself and Gambia by riding home to England on a motorcycle . Now he stood in the new Information Office , briefing the press : " We have no town hall , you see . It 's a couple of huts . So we use the next best building we 've got ? that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort of thing , and H.R.H. His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent will make a speech . Catch him before he opens his mouth please , you photographers , " When several reporters asked for advance copies of the Duke 's speech , Peters informed them that " higher authority " had decided against advance copies of any speeches . " That 's ridiculous ! " said Lloyd Garrison of the New York Times . " There 's not an independent state in all of Africa that 's done that . What 's the reason for the policy ? " " In case there 's a change from the text , " replied Peters . " But that 's exactly why we want advance copies . If we do n't have them we wo n't know . " " The point 's well taken . I 'll see what I can do . " Reggie Lancaster , a tall , red-headed photographer from the Daily Express , asked when he would have a chance to get shots of the royal couple " with real people ? you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions for the press had already been worked out by the police . Lancaster jumped to his feet . " For your interest . " he yelled , " we 've been to dozens of these things before . We ca n't use any more formal handshaking and bouquet-giving . " " I realize there 's not much human interest . " said Peters , trying to calm him . " I 'll admit it 's all ceremony that 's been done before . " Norman Smart , the florid-faced reporter for the same paper , broke in . " I think it should be pointed out that the Duke and Duchess of Kent are the central figures in this story . Everything should be arranged so that we can be facing them . " One of the Americans argued that they could n't care less about Their Royal Highnesses , since " the American public would n't know the Duchess of Kent from the Sheriff of Nottingham . " The press briefing nearly broke up over this Anglo-American conflict . Peters attempted to calm the group by telling what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he 'd " make a better co-respondent than a correspondent . " No one laughed . Peters next outlined a few visits the royal couple would make during their stay . " The Duke 's visit to the oil mill wo n't be much . Just the mill pressing a lot of groundnuts , and H.R.H. mucking about . Now the Duchess will be visiting the maternity clinic at Royal Victoria Hospital . That 's the human interest thing ? the Duchess with a lot of babies . " As the correspondents , reporters , and photographers left , there were mutterings , and during the week " higher authorities " and the press continued to exchange flak over such issues as whether the sun should be in the Duke 's eyes or the cameramen 's lenses . Harried government officials were heard speaking of " a bloody bunch of prima donnas. "  | Early Monday morning , members of the press rode out to the Yundum Airport in three new government minibuses . The entire route was blocked off , and no other cars were on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dogs ? uninformed or unconcerned about the day 's solemnities ? wandered across as usual . Policemen stood at intervals along the route ; one of them was urinating against a bamboo fence . Out at the airport , a large crowd watched the royal plane land , and saw the Duke descend in a gleaming white uniform , followed by the Duchess , his equerry , and her lady-in-waiting . The Duke of Kent is tall and slender , with a pale , bland , boyish face . A cousin of both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh , he graduated from Sandhurst and holds the rank of Captain in the Royal Scots Greys . A press release described him as having " enjoyed rowing at Eton , " " captained his regimental ski team , " and being " fond of polo . " Though young , the Duke is no stranger to the world of diplomatic ceremony . Representing the Queen , he has attended Independence celebrations in Sierra Leone and Uganda . Also standing in for Her Majesty , he has welcomed to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order of the Star of Africa , Grand Band ; and the King of Nepal , who conferred on the Duke the Order of Tri Shakti Patta , First Class , with Chain . The Duchess , the former Katharine Worsley , though a " commoner , " is a charming , radiant young lady whom Central Casting would unhesitatingly use in the role of a fairy princess . The Governor Sir John and Lady Paul , with Prime Minister and Mrs. Jawara , greeted the royal party and led them along a new cement walkway to a thatched-roof reviewing stand , where a few hundred government officials were seated . The Duke reviewed the 150 troops of the Gambia Field Force while the Field Force Band played appropriate tunes . Then the dignitaries climbed into their limousines and headed back to Bathurst . On the way , one of the American reporters asked Capt'n Peters , " What other Dukes and Duchesses do you people have around to use for this sort of thing ? " " Well , there 's Princess Margaret and Tony , the Queen Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we breed them so fast , so we 'll have enough to go around . " At the Civic Reception at Gambia High School , local dignitaries and their wives sat outside in folding chairs , awaiting the royal couple . The midmorning sun blazed down on the women 's flowing gowns , shimmering in pastels of lilac , peach , citron , and lavender . One particularly buxom lady billowed into the courtyard like a ship under full sail , the numerous folds of her body enveloped in layers of sequined organdy . Protruding from her lips was a large brown chewing stick with which , from time to time , she explored her nether dental regions ... About ten o'clock Tuesday evening , after a formal dinner at Government House , Their Royal Highnesses along with others of suitable rank , sat in a box overlooking downtown Wellington Street and watched the parade . The joy of this evening was so contagious that several Western journalists held their own celebration on the balcony of Madi Flats , throwing empty Scotch bottles down onto Wellington Street . On Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bathurst , for a " Mansa Bengo , " or gathering of chiefs . This tradition ? found throughout Africa ? dates back to unrecorded history , when chiefs of a region would gather periodically like feudal lords to pay tribute to their king with speeches or more convertible currency . Gambia 's chiefs and area councilors from every district had been ferried down the river on the country 's only passenger vessel , the Lady Wright . Chiefs , officials , and invited guests now sat in thatched-roof reviewing stands . A layer of peanut shells covered the dusty grounds . When the speeches uttered by a senior chief and the Duke were over , the chiefs went up one by one and shook hands with the Duke , as their retainers and " griots " put on brief displays of dancing and yelling . The " griots " are the traditional musicians of Senegal and Gambia . Like medieval minstrels , they are attached by custom to one royal family , and are responsible for recounting to music the tales and legends of that family 's greatness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated . One British sociologist who studied them recently writes that " For a few coppers a griot will sing one 's praises . For sixpence or one shilling his voice will be louder and his praises more elaborate , while for two or four shillings a man can be made to feel that he is one of the bravest and most generous men in The Gambia . " By five o'clock that afternoon , Gambians began gathering at MacCarthy Square cricket grounds for the Independence Eve flag-raising ceremonies , high point of the week 's festivities . Several thousand had come from up-river districts by truck , bus , taxi , boat , and foot . By nine o'clock the Square and surrounding streets were filled with crowds later estimated at up to 20,000 . A Royal Marines drill team from the Lion opened the evening 's program with a display of precision marching . They were followed by more lively , if less precise , tribal dancing consisting of such diversions as the kumpo , ogoogoo , makalo , kankurang , bolor , piti , and Bambara debool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time in Gambia , while the band played " God Save the Queen . " The crowd was silent . There were tears in the eyes of some British officials . At midnight , the new red , green , and blue flag unfurled atop the pole . Lit by a single spotlight , it hung limp in the breezeless night . The crowd broke into a long cheer , church bells rang , and the band struck up the new national anthem . This time there were tears in Gambian eyes . The delegate from Mali turned to his neighbor and said , " Well , now the real problems begin . " The reporter from the New Gambia , the PPP 's party organ , felt stirred to a more dramatic outburst : This was the most sensational and pathetic moment in all the ceremonies , when we , at last , come to realize that the shackles were not only about our wrists and ankles , but also round our necks , waist and everywhere , but have by God 's grace been broken and shattered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the continent in which he had placed us . The evening ended with fireworks . A fixed display at the far end of the field portrayed in glowing sparklers the features of Prime Minister Jawara , with cap and spectacles . As the sparklers fizzled out , the face slowly disintegrated . Peace and Sanity The next morning was Independence Day , and the crowds gathered again at MacCarthy Square . The Chief Justice swore in Sir John Paul as the first Governor-General . Sir John said that " This small , proud , and happy country can look forward to the future with every confidence . " He concluded by praying that " God may help preserve and prosper this small settlement of peace and sanity in a world which , in many regions , so sadly lacks these qualities . " The Duke of Kent read a message from the Queen , followed by a speech of his own , and then presented Prime Minister Jawara with something called the " Constitutional Instruments . " In reply , the Prime Minister said , " We are very conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... We are a small nation , who like to think that the orderly nature of our people can contribute something to the peace and stability of this Continent . . . . With The Gambia 's characteristic tolerance , understanding , and friendliness , we intend to align ourselves on the side of the world 's peaceful forces . " " Thank heaven for that , " commented one British reporter . That evening , a glittering State Ball took place on the grounds of Government House . Music was supplied by the Royal Marine Band from the Lion and the Eagles Jazz Band from Bathurst . Lloyd Garrison of the Times stirred up considerable comment among the heavily bemedaled guests with a maroon-and-blue sash he wore diagonally across his chest beneath his white dinner jacket . Garrison , who had covered the Congo from time to time , explained modestly to those who inquired that he had been awarded " Patrice Lumumba 's belt " for some vague act of heroism . The belt , an Ivy League model , had actually been awarded earlier that evening by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other Gifts In between the various ceremonies , the thirty state delegates greeted Prime Minister D. K. Jawara and bestowed on him gifts from their countries . State delegations were led in most cases by the country 's nearest diplomatic representative , usually based in Dakar , Senegal , or Lagos , Nigeria . Among those who paid greater tribute was the United States , which sent from Washington G. Mennen Williams , then Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs . By far the tallest delegate , Mr. Williams stood out at every ceremony , his gray crew cut and polka-dot bow tie clearly visible above the crowd of fezzes and Moslem caps . He was a tireless worker . Almost every evening , after days filled with exhausting ceremonies and meetings with  | Gambian officials , Mr. Williams was out in the streets joining buxom Woloff women in energetic street dances . At the State Ball and the Miss Independence Dance , he waltzed , pachangaed , and high-lifed with the wives of nearly every important Gambian official . While British observers looked askance at what they considered such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams has the gift of enjoying himself so much at such occasions that one hesitates to call his behavior diplomacy . His bluff , gregarious manner made a distinct impression . On Wednesday , he lunched at the hotel with the Gambian Minister of Finance and other officials . At one point during the meal , Williams leaned over to the Minister , who was eating , clapped him on the back , and asked , " Well , what are you gon na do now that you 're independent ? " The startled Minister smiled and continued eating . During the Prime Minister 's reception at the hotel that afternoon , Williams walked over to a tiny African who stood enveloped in a flowing brown robe . Grasping him by the shoulders , Williams shook him briskly , and bellowed , " Malawi ! " The little man looked up at Williams , smiled and shook his head . " Are n't you from Malawi ? " asked Williams , still holding the African firmly by the shoulders . The little man shook his head . " Were n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Malawi shook his head again , beginning to look a bit frightened . " Well , you havin ' a good time here at Independence ? " The little man nodded uneasily . Williams let go of him and walked away to greet other acquaintances . According to a New Gambia reporter , the Prime Minister 's reception " was the largest ever thrown in The Gambia . The guests were over five hundred , comprising all tribes and creeds of The Gambia . ... The service was superb . Drinks and refreshments were in galore . " Drinks were indeed in such galore that one official of the Gambia Workers Union became excessively demonstrative in his joy , and had to be dragged out of the lounge . America 's gifts to Gambia consisted of one heavy-duty loading crane for Bathurst 's port facilities , one heavy tractor for land clearing , and twelve rice-hulling machines . To those who wished to make comparisons ? and many Gambians wished to do so ? the $100,000 value of these gifts compared favorably with other expressions of friendship received that week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggling sum for such a rich country to give . Along with its more than $3 million in annual aid , and a special grant of $70,000 for half the cost of the Independence celebration , Great Britain announced gifts of a $224,000 river launch for the Head of State , a new Speaker 's chair and some furniture for the Cabinet Room . A problem arose when West Germany announced that it too planned to give an executive river craft . England finally withdrew in favor of West Germany . A dispute also arose over the Speaker 's chair , for Speaker A. Sam Jack , who had designed the present chair himself ( the former one was burned by a political malcontent ) , let it be known that he was quite happy with it . The issue grew more muddled when Bathurst 's Nigeria Welfare Association announced that they too were giving a new Speaker 's chair . Before the Government could suggest a substitute , the chair arrived ? a seven-foot ornate throne with canary-yellow upholstery and carved fleur-de-lis . It sat for a week outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do with it . One British official privy to the affair of the chair later discussed the Nigerian model : " They ran through four alternatives . They could use it to enthrone new chiefs , but the chair would never survive the trip up-river in a Land-Rover . They tried to give it to the Speaker , but he likes the one he has very much , thank you . They thought of giving it to the Mayor , since he 's tall enough , but then someone suggested giving it to Gambia High School as a prop for amateur theatricals . " If Russia intended to vie for Gambia 's allegiance in its struggle for the nonaligned emerging nations , it did not show it with some icons and a case of vodka . While Israel offered twenty-five scholarships , the United Arab Republic never even appeared on the list of givers . India gave Mrs. Jawara a shawl and a handbag , while the Pakistani delegate presented a silver salver . Australia gave an oil painting and a desk set , Canada gave two projectors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase . Nigeria made what may have been relatively the most handsome gift from any country ? $28,000 for development projects . Alongside this sum , Ghana 's carved mahogany box , Kenya 's silver tray , and Zambia 's lampstand struck many as slack . Senegal provoked the loudest outcry , when midway through the celebrations a Senegalese fishing boat , presumably acting on the part of the government in Dakar , dumped five tons of assorted fresh fish on the Bathurst wharf . Although the purpose was ostensibly to help in feeding the Independence crowds from up-river , most Gambians considered the gift an insult , particularly in view of the fact  | that the fish were probably caught in Gambian waters . As gifts continued to pour in , the Gambia News Bulletin published periodic lists , including their approximate value . This practice contributed to a running public debate over the degree of generosity involved in each case . Intimidated by the publicity , local commercial firms grew touchy about discussing their gifts . The Bank of West Africa and Elder Dempster Lines each gave $14,000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale , the largest French trading firm in town , gave $6,160 to the Agricultural Department . The other four French firms together gave Royal Victoria Hospital a sterilization unit . S. Madi Ltd. , the largest Lebanese firm , gave the Prime Minister a Chrysler Imperial convertible , plus several thousand dollars ' worth of dinnerware engraved with the Gambia crest . Chellerams , an Indian importer and retail firm , gave a diathermy set and an operating table for the clinic at Bansang . British Petroleum , which is exploring for offshore oil along Gambia 's coast , gave a compressor for the Technical School . Shell Oil gave Gambia High School a set of reference books . Mobil Oil gave twenty wall thermometers and six hundred ballpoint pens . One week after Independence , an anonymous reader wrote in to the New Gambia with a critique of these gifts . While complimenting the firms which , in his opinion , had acquitted themselves with distinction , he offered a word of advice to the others : First and foremost , it is a shock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see five French Firms which have been long established in The Gambia , after exploiting all that we had and sending all to France to develop their own country ... can not donate something worth the while , but only ? 600 each .... I do not intend to force anyone to give what they do not want to give but I feel attention should be drawn to the paucity of the gifts given . . . . THE MANAGERS OF THESE FIRMS SHOULD REALLY RECONSIDER THEIR GIFTS . " Hope They Must Have " @# Unofficial Bathurst was just as active as the government during Independence Week . Receptions were given by the Cooperative Central Bank , Gambia Labor Union , PPP Women 's Society , Gambia Oilseeds Marketing Board , Elder Dempster Lines , Nigeria Airways , and the Methodist Boys ' High School . The Methodist Girls ' High School ExPupils ' Association held a buffet and dance at Masonic Hall , and the Gambia Drama Festival Corn- mittee presented a special performance of Antigone at the High School .

The Young Rising Society held tribal dancing on Fitzgerald Street , the United Party held Woloff dancing in Anglesea Street , and the PPP held drumming and dancing in Hagen Street . The only function that did not go off as scheduled was a facetiously named " Opposition Party , " planned for the night of the State Ball by a group of British residents not invited to it . A menacing phone call from edgy " higher authorities " led them to cancel the party . Like most changes in Gambia , Independence took quite some time before moving up-river . For several weeks after the Bathurst festivities were over , village headmen , district chiefs , and Members of Parliament organized celebrations in provincial villages and towns . Nearly 10,000 people gathered at Bansang for kankurang and seruba dancing , after which they settled down to feasting on seven bulls .

" The PPP leaders of Sami District held an impressive affair at which some 4,000 people consumed 10 bulls and 20 sheep , and Samba Joss gave a display of acrobatic cycling . The Bathurst celebrations went off with an orderly precision which surprised and impressed everyone . For weeks British officials had rehearsed the various MacCarthy Square ceremonies . Rabid Gambian nationalists , who had strenuously objected to the " colonialists " running a purely Gambian affair , were heard the following week proudly pointing out how smoothly Gambians could run things . There were , of course , minor indignities and calamities . The Lion 's arrival on Sunday morning was nearly marred when some bags of cement on the freshly hosed-down wharf split open during Saturday night . By morning the wharf was covered with a layer of rapidly congealing gray mud .

( Ghanaian currency is neither acceptable nor convertible outside Ghana . ) A tank truck struck the gate as it left the oil mill one evening , spilling seven tons of peanut oil onto the main road . This made driving a bit sticky until someone covered the oil with a layer of peanut shells . Commissioner Gordon Edwards ' white Rolls-Royce was driven off the road into a swamp . The working press suffered a few near-catastrophies also .

Despite these troubles , correspondents managed to get their stories out to the rest of the world . African papers hailed the occasion and damned Great Britain for having left Gambia in its present condition . In Senegal , Dakar Matin predicted that now with Independence , Gambians would certainly choose to become part of Senegal . The influential British weekly , West Africa , called Gambia " the worst example . . . of the carving up of Africa in which European powers have indulged . " The Manchester Guardian Weekly said that " Gambia ought never to have occurred , " but that " it deserves a few cheers for its pluck .

S. magazines and papers , having no correspondents in West Africa , had to rely on the wire services . Thus many of them carried the same quote ( later denied ) from ex-veterinarian Jawara : " There 's not a cow in The Gambia that does n't know me personally . " The New York Times called Gambia " the most overlooked and unwanted 86 ENTER GAMBIA , LAUGHING  | state in Africa .

" A sample of Gambian reactions to Independence appeared in a special issue of The Nation , a fourpage sporadic Bathurst monthly . Mr. Yoro Khan , a Head Laborer with the Public Works Department , told the reporter , " I am really happy about Independence because other sister countries have it and therefore The Gambia should have hers as well . " Mrs. N'Goneh M'Boge , a shopkeeper , expected " improvement in agriculture , health , education , and housing for all sections of the community during the Independence . " Madam Kumajar , a street merchant , was happy that " Independence is at close quarters and although a seller on the sidewalk , I am hoping that all will be well so that getting a stall at the Albert Market after Independence should not be a problem .

As a matter of fact , the thought of it smashes me to fragments with harder tasks of individual responsibilities ahead .
