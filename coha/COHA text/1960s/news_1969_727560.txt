The cost of borrowing to buy kitutomobiles , to purchase major home appliances and to make home improvements , among other things , was increased by one-quarter of one per cent , effective Monday , by the First National City Bank , New York City 's largest bank and the leader in the personal-loan field . A spokesman for the Chase Manhattan Bank said an increase was " under serious consideration . " The Bank of America , the nation 's largest , is also reviewing a possible rise in loan rates , a spokesman reported . The move by First National City marked the second time this week that that institution has taken the lead in raising key interest rates .

Since mid-December , when the Federal Reserve System signaled its current drive to move decisively to stop inflation , In- terest rates have accelerated markedly . According to John J. Reynolds , senior vice president of the First National City Bank in charge of its personal finance department , the higher rate on personal loans was made necessary by the increased cost of money generally and also by the increase in operating expenses .

When First National City raised personal loan rates in May , it stated that " the increased cost to the bank of lonable funds has made a rate increase necessary at this time .

" He described the bank 's operating expenses as " a major factor " 1 in the cost of personal loans . ' . Short-Run Emphasis When First National City Bank raised its prime rate earlier this week , George C. Scott , chairman of the credit policy committee , emphasized that his bank was responding to short-run conditions in the money market .

" By lifting its rate to 6 per cent on unsecured personal loans and property modernization loans for 36 months , First National City Bank moved to the legal limit in New York .
