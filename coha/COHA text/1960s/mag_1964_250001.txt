The message from Madrid to Buenos Aires sounded confident enough : " I have irrevocably decided to return in the year 1964 . " Juan Domingo Pern , 69 , Argentina 's exiled dictator , has been talking about returning for nearly ten years , but never before had he set a definite time limit or made such extensive plans . <P> According to Pern 's plan , Operacin Retorno will take him before Dec. 31 to either Paraguay or Uruguay , where he will wait while an emissary goes on to Buenos Aires to announce the imminent return of El Lder . Then if Argentina 's 3,000,000 Peronistas react as Pern hopes they will , the old dictator will move on to Buenos Aires and demand immediate presidential elections , which he reckons he would easily win . Should serious opposition develop , Pern says : " Sometimes in history a civil war has been the only way to save a sinking nation . " <P> New Tune &; " Tourists . " Until a few months ago , such talk was laughed off by most Argentines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Argentine army high command concedes : " The return of Pern does not appear an impossibility . " Under pressure from more moderate advisers , Peron has changed his tune , no longer rants about ruling as a strongman , but says rather that his role would be to unite the country 's warring factions . The inability of President Arturo Illia 's weak-willed regime to cope with the country 's deepening economic problems makes many Argentines wish for a more aggressive government . <P> Some retired army officers and a few still active ones in the lower echelons may be willing to make a deal with Pern . Many politicians also seem eager to make deals ; police estimate that 500 Argentine " tourists " are now in Madrid seeking to see the onetime dictator . <P> Most important , President Illia has said that " Pern 's return is up to Pern . " Devious Scheme ? Still , Pern faces tremendous opposition . Alarmed by the reports of Pern 's preparations , Argentina 's chief of naval operations , Rear Admiral Benigno Varela , last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under any circumstances . " Anti-Pern civilians have organized a commando band to storm the airport or harbor if Pern tries to land . <P> Pern 's chances of regaining power are , in fact , remote . Some observers think another ploy may be in the wind . <P> They have a sneaking suspicion that the present exercise is a devious scheme into which Pern has been drawn by his top lieutenant in Argentina-Augusto Timoteo Vandor , 41 . Known as El Lobo , The Wolf , Vandor has already proved his cunning by shouldering aside old-line Peronista bosses for control of the Peronista organization . He believes in " Peronismo without Pern , " and if Pern fails to return after setting such a specific deadline , his disappointed followers may finally write off their old hero . In that case , El Lobo would be in position to convert himself from Pern lieutenant to genuine leader of the largest political faction in Argentina .
