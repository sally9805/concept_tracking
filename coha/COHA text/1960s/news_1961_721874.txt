txt There are growing signs that President Kennedy 's proposal to continue the foreign economic aid program this year at 2 cast of nearly $3,000,000,000 will encounter greater difficulties with Congress than aid ( programs have met in many years . Hearings on the program are now being conducted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee . The hearings will continue Monday , There is opposition especially to the President 's request for authority to borrow $7,300,000 , - 000 from the Treasury over the ' next five years for economic-aid projects . Lobbies working against the bill are articulate and well-organized . Those in favor of it are markedly less so . And even ' among the traditional supporters of the foreign aid concept on Capitol Hill , there is a growing disenchantment with the , whole idea , a feeling that it has become an unfortunate necessity rather than a challenging idea , ' Real Trouble ' Is Foreseen " I think we are in for real trouble this year , " a veteran , staff member of the Senate ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money the Administration is asking for is less of a problem than its request to put the program on a long-term financial basis . " This throws up the prospect to the anti-foreign-aid people that if this bill is enacted the deed ca n't be'undone for years to come . So we expect them to put everything they have into the fight this year . " We 'll get a foreign aid bill of some kind , of course . But I would n't place any bets now on the President getting anywhere near the full amount he has asked for or any of the fiveyear borrowing authority , and that is the guts of his program . " Committee Lobbies The principal lobbying effort against the bill is being waged , as it has been for the last several years , by an ultra-conservative business men 's organization known as the Citizens Foreign Aid Committee . This is the successor organization to For America , which in its heyday embraced a wide spectrum of political advocacy from isolationism to states ' rights . Its national chairman is Walter Harnischfeger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party affairs . Army Brig . Gen. Bonner Fellers , retired , who has been identified for many years with various Right-Wing political and patriotic movements , is national director and operating head of the organization 's Washington headquarters . The general counsel is Clarence E. Manion of South Bend , Ind. , a former dean of the University of - Notre Dame Law School . Seven members of the organi zation 's forty-man national corn- , mittee , including Mr. Manion , are also national directors of ' the ultra - conservative Johni Birch Society . The Citizens Foreign Aid , Committee Is uncompromising in its opposition to all forms of foreign aid except in a few limited fields of technical and military assistance . President Kennedy is asking $1,885,000,000 for military aid in the fiscal year starting July 1 . The committee asserts that foreign aid has stimulated foreign competition with domestic business , causing unemployment , and has brought about a flight of gold from this country . Furthermore , in the committee 's view , foreign aid is chiefly responsible for the size of the national debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laos , also contends that foreign aid has failed to accomplish its purpose . Instead of winning allies against communism , the group contends , the foreign aid program has fostered neutralism . The committee 's foreign aid platform is short and direct : It recommends that the President 's program for this year be cut to less than $1,000,000,000 , and that for all practical purposes it be terminated within two years . The Citizens Foreign Aid Committee is not a big operation by usual lobbying standards . According to General Fellers , its membership consists lof " forty-four dedicated Americans " and it operates on a budget of " around $50,000 a year . " Its principal activities include the marshaling of witnesses to testify in opposition to the bill before the various committees of Congress , and the publication of pamphlets and newsletters exposing what it believes to be the weaknesses and fallacies of foreign aid . While such groups as the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Farm Bureau Federation will also be heard in opposition to the aid program , much of the material 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Citizens Foreign Aid Committee exerts both an in-. tellectual and an emotional impact in its propaganda . There have been unquestioned blunders and failures in the foreign aid program , and these are effectively exploited . There is not , on the other side , a comparable lobby with the same singleness of purpose or the same resources to propagandize at the grassroots . Many organizations ? the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , the United States Chamber of Commerce , and the Friends Committee on National Legislation , for example ? are for foreign aid and will testify in its behalf . But they all have other , and frequently more pressing , matters on their legislative agendas . Possibly the most earnest work in the field ' is done by various intellectual and academic organizations . These include the Committee for International Economic Growth and the National Conference on International Economic and So-1 cial Development . The latter group has just announced that lit will sponsor a conference in Washington late next week , with President Kennedy as the principal speaker .

" It is a lot easier to work up people 's fears over the ' giveaway program ' than it is to get them enthused about winning the uncommitted nations away from communism , " an experienced labor lobbyist said yesterday . " Scholarly pamphlets and seminars about foreign aid are all right , but they do n't win many converts in Congress . " A Senator said the prospects would be brighter if , In some ' , way , the program could be given a " new- look . " The Marshall Plan , and Point Four , he said . had the element of drama and , challenge . " But it looks like we are being asked to try the same old medicine all over again , not because we think it will cure us , but because we do n't know of anything else to do . " It is upon this element of despair that the organized opponents of foreign aid hope this year to build their strongest assault yet on the program .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
