Two years ago , Alan S. Boyd refused an offer to head the Association of American Railroads and accepted in stead Lyndon Johnson 's appointment as the first U.S. Secretary of Transportation . Last week Boyd joined the rail roads after all - under a different Johnson . He took the post of president of the Illinois Central Railroad , succeeding William B. Johnson , 50 , who will be come chairman while remaining chief executive . " W.B.J. , " as he is known around the railroad 's Chicago headquarters , will also continue to head the parent Illinois Central Industries . It is a holding company that owns more than $200 million worth of real estate and air rights in Chicago alone , and has lately acquired some manufacturing companies . Boyd will handle day-to-day railroad operations , so Johnson can pursue further diversification . <P> Talent for Innovation . Boyd and John son are lawyers and longtime friends with a talent for innovation . Johnson came to the Illinois Central in early 1966 after rejuvenating the moribund Railway Express . He increased profits by 41% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . Johnson raised the investment in new cars and track and computerized the line 's traffic-information operation . At the railroad 's Chicago commuter stations , he installed turnstiles that open automatically when a passenger inserts a magnetically coded ticket in a slot . Through a merger now awaiting approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission , Johnson hopes to link his railroad-which covers 6,714 miles in 14 states , from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico-with the 2,734-mile Gulf , Mobile &; Ohio , whose tracks often parallel the Illinois Central 's . <P> As the hiring of Boyd suggests , Johnson has not hesitated to depart from the railroad 's tradition of promoting from within . Boyd , the former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board , was an able and dedicated administrator of the $6 billion-a-year Transportation Department . But he was not too adept in dealing with Congress , and that stymied his efforts to bring the Maritime Administration under the department 's jurisdiction and to relieve overburdened airports . In Boyd , the Illinois Central may also be getting some trouble ; conflict-of-interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of $25.2 million to improve commuter services on the Illinois Central . The grant was made in December while Boyd was under consideration as the railroad 's president . Boyd disassociated himself from the grant , but Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe has promised to investigate . <P> The experience of regulating a major segment of U.S. industry has taught Boyd an important lesson . He says : " We have put artificial restraints on various parts of the economy , which do not allow them to operate efficiently . " He cites the railroads : they have been " hamstrung " by Washington and should be given greater freedom to raise rates .
