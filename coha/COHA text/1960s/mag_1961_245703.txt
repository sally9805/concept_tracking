The Inaugural Sir : As a student of history , I believe that Kennedy 's inauguration speech was one of the best ever given in the history of the country . One can not say the same thing about the prayers that preceded it-especially the first one , which was too long and seemed to be more like a speech than a prayer . No wonder the podium caught fire . <P> SIDNEY I. PHILLIPS <P> Vancouver , Wash . <P> Sir : <P> The inaugural day weather in Washington , D.C. was in perfect accord with the snow job to which the nation was subjected during the Los Angeles Convention and the campaign . <P> S.V. FROHLICHER <P> Hudson , Wis . <P> Sir : <P> Inauguration week in Washington sounded strangely like " Hell week , " " Pledge week " and Senior Prom . <P> <P> HELEN KENNEDY* <P> Long Beach , Calif . <P> Sir : <P> Only two individuals at the inaugural ceremony made any lasting impression : John Kennedy and Robert Frost . <P> <P> K. W. ROBBINS <P> Thornton , N.H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a stirring example of how one strong voice can rouse free nations from a state of pessimistic gloom to a confident enthusiastic optimism . It won for us in the last world war ; may we have more and more of it to win for us now . <P> W. F. C. DEVLIN <P> Laguna Beach , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : Please , TIME , a Rolls-Royce never " chugs , " as captioned in your Jan. 27 issue , en route to the Kennedy inaugural ball . As a devoted member of the Rolls-Royce Owners Club , this borders on blasphemy to the faithful . <P> A Rolls-Royce does not " chug " no matter what the weather may be . It may skip , falter and , on rare and seldom proven occasions , even fail , but chug-never ! It glides . <P> <P> KEITH MARVIN <P> Troy , N.Y . <P> First Lady <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on the story about Jackie Kennedy . May all the " common as an old shoe " variety of Americans read it and forget their snobbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will rejoice at individuality , especially when it is embellished by extraordinary grace and beauty . Where more appropriate than in the White House ? <P> MARGARET S. HARRIS <P> Anacortes , Wash . <P> Sir : <P> After reading your recent stories on Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy , et alii , I 'm delightfully convinced that we have again that rare phenomenon : government of adults , by adults , for adults . <P> <P> JOHN HAKAC <P> Tucson , Ariz . <P> Sir : <P> Your article on Mrs. Kennedy represents a shocking display of bad taste . Beneath the sugared veneer there is a coarseness and vulgarity made up of gossipy half-truths , snatches of conversation printed out of context and snide insinuations which are evil and destructive in nature . The First Lady of the land deserves better treatment than this . <P> <P> WILLIAM R. VAN GEMERT <P> Roslindale , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Re Mrs. Kennedy : a sensitive article about a sensitive person ! While Mr. K. did n't get my vote , Mrs. K. does . <P> <P> MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Sir : <P> Please do n't keep me in suspense . What did Jackie do for the 40 unexpected luncheon guests ? <P> <P> DOYLE L. MCCULLER <P> Houston <P> She bought a casserole course from a neighborhood Greek restaurant , served it with a salad and raspberries for dessert. - ED.
