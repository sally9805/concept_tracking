txt The nation 's steel industry , with its mills running at only a little more than 50% of capacity , is cutting back on capital spending plans There 's nothing surprising about that , of course But the factors underlying the cutback are not what you might think . And they may offer a clue to the future of capital spending generally Mist , the steel companies ' curtailment of spending plans stems not from any pessimism about future sales prospects but instead from i educed earnings As interest rates have risen in recent years , steel makers , like a lot of other companies , have financed a growing portion of their capital spending with earnings , rather than with borrowed money . Second , the drop in the steel industry 's spending plans is not very sharp . The industry 's capital projects for the past year or so have been aimed chiefly at increasing efficiency rather than at boosting capa6ity . With wage costs rising and with competition barring price boosts , the steel makers are even more interested in stepping up efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been slanting their plant and equipment programs toward cost-cutting for some time And these industries , again like the steel companies , may he loath to forego such savings in these class when costs are squeezing profits . With interest rates declining , many companies may be moved to step up borrowing to see their capital programs through . The Commerce Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission , which interview businessmen regularly about their capital spending plans , have already lowered their estimate for 1960 . The two agencies last month predicted plant and equipment outlays this year would total $36.4 billion . That would be an increase of 12% over 1959. but the agencies last March had forecast a record-tieing total of $37 billion , or a 14% gain over last year . Capital outlays of the steel industry this year had been expected to total between $1 6 billion and $1.7 billion , compared with about Sl billion last year But talks with steel company officials and suppliers of steel4haking equipment indicate outlays this year Will fall short of the forecast . Says Karl A. Eck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill equipment at Birdsboro , Pa : " I 've bid on $10 million worth of equipment at one steel mill this year ; all of it has been put on the shelf . " " The Contracts Were n't Let " " We have bid on three projects recently , each valued at about $10 million , and all of them have been held up , " says John C. Kinnicut , Jr .. assistant chief engineer of Morgan Construction Co .. a steel mill engineering and construction firm at Worcester , Mass . " The money was appropriated , the jobs engineered , the bids submitted and then the contracts were n't let . " Many steel companies are reluctant to admit they are cutting back their capital spending plans . But Chicago 's Inland Steel Co. two weeks ago stated frankly that Its $70 million outlay this year would ' fall about $10 million short of earlier plans . It added that its outlays next year will slip below this year 's level . Says an executive of another major steel company : " Curtailments appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress that the capital programs are being delayed , not canceled . Suppliers report no decline in requests for bids and quotations . And a few steel makers are clinging firmly to earlier plans for plant and equipment outlays . " We 're Going to Stick to It " " We have a three-year spending program and we are going to stick to it no matter what happens , " declares one steel company execu-tive Other steel makers indicate they will step up their spending plans again if earnings increase sufficiently to provide financing for the programs which have been delayed . If interest rates continue to decline , several steel companies say , they may reach a level where the companies will be induced to borrow money to speed their spending . In the 1950 's , steel companies spent an average of approximately $1 billion a year to boost their basic steel manufacturing capacity to 118 6 million ingot tons at the beginning of this year from 100 million at the start of 1950 . More recently , as the gap between capacity and demand has grown and steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , along with rising wage and related costs , the effort has been switched toward cost reduction . For instance , Republic Steel Corp . of Cleveland early this year launched a three-year , $375 million expansion program . But this program . for all of its size , will increase ingot capacity only 2 6 , ' , or 330,000 tons , according to company officials , who say Its main purpose will be cost ' reduction . A Republic spokesman says that while the company has probably eased its drive to complete lower priority projects under this program it Is pressing even harder on other efforts , including a new hot strip mill at Warren , Ohio , which is expected to improve Republic 's competitive position In steel coil Opportunity for Cost Cuts The opportunities for cost reductions in steel malting through investments in new equipment rue perhaps broader today than ever before , according to steel Industry engineers . Rolling mills , for Instance , are now capable of shooting out steel at a rate more than 15 ' 4 faster than 10 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further IA hile reducing the need for manpower . Representatives of several . firms supplying rolling mill equipment report orders are still holding up as mills drive toward , economies and better quality One new mill installed for a smaller Midwestern steel producer is used to produce small quantities of some 400 different products : it ' educes the time required for switching fi oni product to product to 15 minutes fi orn two to three hours for the mill pitiously used It on ore pellets . produced from low-grade ore at processing plants near ore mines , can Increase blast furnace output by 20,4 : the pellets are higher in iron content than most ore Republic and Armco Steel Corp . are proceeding with a 5125 million expansion of their jointly-owned Reserve Mining Co .. which produces pellets at its plant at Silver Bay , Minn Some equipment suppliers claim the cost of producing a ton of steel can be reduced by at least 15% by feeding oxygen into steel furnaces . The oxygen speeds the steel-making process A subsidiary of National Steel Corp . is installing two oxygen-fed furnaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ways to speed production , through higher temperatures and improved gauges and controls . U , S. Steel a couple of weeks ago announced that it was going ahead with a new 850,000-ton blast furnace at its Duquesne Works near Pittsburgh Since neither U.S. Steel nor other steel companies appear to need additional capacity , the decision was atttibuted by industry observers to an expectation that there would be substantial cost savings with the new unit . Sometimes the investments by steel companies are dictated by the demands of major customers . such as auto companies , whose business will go to the steel companies that can best meet their needs . An example is Republic 's vigorous push to complete its new rolling mill at Warren , Ohio , which represents an important part of its capital spending program In addition to getting increased efficiency and quality from the mills the company needs the inew facility to handle the big billets necessary to roll larger coils of strip steel . Customers are demanding these larger coils because they last longer and ' thus reduce costly " down time " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press . A Republic official says that a steel company which can supply 1,600-pound coils is likely to get business ahead of a company that is limited to 1,200-pound coils Robert C Hiltbrand , a sales official for Electric Furnace Co. of Salem . Ohio , says that demand has continued strong for his company 's " bright annealing " furnaces , which increase the quality of stainless steel Only one company , Armco , had the process a year or so ago , he says . Then auto makers raised their standards ; they had been troubled with the effects of highway salt on stainless steel . The salt is put on roads to melt snow and lee . Suddeply , the demand for bright annealing furnaces has increased . The furnaces raise the surface chrome content of stainless steel to 18% from 10% to 12% . Electric Furnace in recent months has received four orders for its furnaces , and says nearly every stainless steel producer has asked for bids.                    @
