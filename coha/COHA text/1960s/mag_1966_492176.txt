Actually Goldberg , who is nut florid and certainly not apoplectic , was feeling the first effects of a virus infection in the middle ear . For days he suffered from vertigo that kept him in bed within the ambassadorial apartment in the Waldorf Towers , 42 floors above 111anhattan . For weeks after that he had to navigate with such caution that every curbstone became an adventure . It was an unsettling experience  --  people who have suffered from similar infections describe them as thoroughly unpleasant  --  perhaps particularly unsettling to a man with Goldberg 's specific set of gears . Before the illness . his walk . like his manner , usually was described as jaunty or cocky , and he maintained a consistently exhausting pace without falling sick . " But this job at the U.N .. " Goldberg says humbly . " is the toughest job I 've ever had . Why . I 've been able to have just five dinners alone with my wife since August . Five , " Goldberg repeats , shaking his head for emphasis , but slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day , " he says . " starts at eight or so when I begin going over State Department reports . After that . staff meetings and meetings with ambassadors , foreign ministers , important men . Sometimes they can help me . Sometimes they want me to help them . Add to that my work on the floor or in the committees and the evening meetings and the formal dinners and the private ones . They 're all a part of this job . " Goldberg pausesbefore he concludes in a matter-of-fact way that muffles the impact of the words : " I can see now what brought Adlai down . " One does not really expect to hear Arthur Goldberg musing about mortality . Like so many others drafted into government service by John Kennedy , he is devoutly young-in-heart . His background suggests a man totally involved in life . Getting ahead in life . Getting the most out of life . Being useful in life . Wanting 100 years of life . Goldberg has come very far very fast , playing within the rules , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is proud of himself . Before entering government work he was a labor lawyer , the best labor lawyer , an incredibly persuasive man who earned in excess of $100,000 a year from union clients without losing the respect of big business . Enlisted as Secretary of Labor by John Kennedy , Goldberg immediately became one of Kennedy 's " two or three most important cabinet members . " From the outset Kennedy consulted him not only on matters of labor , but on economics , defense and personal headaches . When the President had that final soulful session during which he convinced an uncharacteristically coy brother to become Attorney General . the only other person in the room was persuasive Arthur Goldberg . " Arthur . " suggests a friend . " could have come up with a reasonable response to anything Bobby might possibly have said , even if Bobby had wanted to say a lot . " After less than two years in the Cabinet , Goldberg ascended to the Supreme Ctiourt , following the late Felix Frankfurter , who in turn had followed the late Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reality which politicians often deny exists . He was 54 when he joined the bench , and the happy saga of Goldberg seemed to have reached a satisfactory conclusion . Before him stretched an honored and magisterial old age . enlivened by Seders. secular banquets and Washington Redskin football games . Goldberg was surprised last July when Lyndon Johnson asked him to become ambassador to the United Nations . " The first thing I did . " he says , " was suggest to the President a number of Americans who might be more suitable for the job than I. " A pragmatist , he was surprised but not struck dumb . Johnson invited Goldberg to fly with him to Stevenson 's funeral , and in the presidential jet , on the way to the burial , Arthur Goldberg said yes , he was willing , yes , he would leave the bench , yes . " I thought , " Goldberg says , " what the hell . The country has given me two wonderful jobs . I owe the country something for that . 1 ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one questions Goldberg 's integrity or memory . but some do point out , in the interest of completeness , that he was not divinely happy on the bench . " The secretary 's phone rang all the time , " Goldberg had remarked . " The justice 's phone never rings . " To someone else he had observed in surprise , " They do n't even give you a car in this job . " An outgoing , mobile man , Goldberg . some of his friends now suggest . was appointed to an introspective judicial job 10 years too soon . Sending Goldberg to the United Nations is a good example of Lyndon Johnson 's political genius . In Goldberg . Johnson found a man who had the immediate , almost automatic support of everyone dedicated to the U.N . Liberals talked of his forcefulness and assured one another that Goldberg would never bow to humiliations as Stevenson , however unhappily , had done Conservatives , such as Everett McKinley Dirksen. a Seder guest of the Goldbergs ' , liked his practical bent . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editorial writers . first noting that labor-management disputes were not exactly comparable to arguments between sovereign states , then observed that they were not exactly different either . Viva Goldberg ! is what the editorialists concluded . Thus Johnson had what he may value more than anything else : a national consensus cheering an unexpected move by Lyndon Johnson . The President seems less sure of the inter . national scene . and international observers seemed less sure of Arthur Goldberg . Arab delegates announced that they were going to consider him a Zionist. until he proved that he was not . k " We have transcripts of speeches he has made to B'nai B'rith . " said one . ) Others spoke of his inexperience in world affairs . Foreign diplomats deeply admired Adlai Stevenson , and it is doubtful that any new American ambassador who was not a bald . sad-faced , eloquent Princeton liberal could have won them over very easily . Goldberg . a Crane Junior College man with a rnidwestem twang and a driving lawyer 's bluntness. did not soon charm them . His first impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his worst . Generally , he makes no ringing phrases . his wit is slight and his references are legalistic , not classical . In this speech , his opening statement to the General Assembly , he compounded these negative qualities with such a superfluity of references to Johnson that a West European remarked . " We might have been listening to a Russian praising the Chairman . " Aware of his limitations as an orator , Goldberg proceeded to devote himself to that which he does best : meeting people singly or in small groups , head to head . There are 117 nations in the U.N .. and the roster of delegates runs 193 pages long . iGoldberg remarked not long ago . " My God , I 'm like a lawyer with 116 clients . " Meeting hundreds of delegates during a General Assembly session with more than 100 items on its agenda ? " That 's nearly 12,000 country positions on individual items " ? provides some measure of the pace Goldberg found rough . " I 'd like to ask a rude question and a philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening as the black limousine , license number S 201. drifted through Manhattan traffic toward the Waldorf-Astoria . It had been a long workday and it was going to be longer . Goldberg puffed his cheeks and nodded . " Go ahead . " " There are reports the President promised you something better , say the Vice Presidency next time , if you 'd take this job . " Goldberg waved his hand impatiently . " That 's foolish , " he said . " I left political life when I joined the Bench . What 's the philosophical question ? " " Well , now that you 've been here for a while , I was wondering what you thought of the future of the U.N . and the future of man in a nuclear age . " " That , " Goldberg said slowly . " certainly is a philosophical question . It is the philosophical question . " He stared toward the red telephone opposite him in the back of the limousine and seemed disinclined to answer further . " Are you encouraged ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that . I 'm not encouraged . Peace is such a fragile thing . It can be threatened in so many places in so many ways . I 'm not encouraged , but you can say this : I 'm not discouraged either . Got it ? Do n't say I 'm encouraged . Say I 'm not discouraged . That way you 'll be about right . " The answer seemed to cheer him and he mentioned the party to which he was going later . " The ambassador who 's giving it seemed to be in , uh , a bit of trouble with his foreign minister , and I gather the idea of the party is to impress the foreign minister , who 's in town . Maybe we can all do ourselves a little good tonight . " The total good that Goldberg has done at the United Nations is difficult to evaluate after one Assembly session . Most of his work at the U.N . and in Washington involves continuing issues . Further , Goldberg himself is impressed to the point of awe with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private positions that he constantly disappoints liberal audiences who hope for hints of a dissent from Johnson 's policy on Vietnam . Indeed . if the U.N . were not such a turbulent confluence of secondary sources , it might be hard to learn if Goldberg has done any real good at all . But certain ratings can be made . Before the session even began , Goldberg was influential in working out a complicated financial compromise that permitted the General Assembly to take voles for the first time in almost a year . Ever since the Congo crisis began in 1960. the U. N. had gone deeper and deeper into debt as I he Soviets and French refused to pay their share of the costs . When the U.S. insisted that the delinquent nations be deprived of their voting rights , the U.N . decided not to have any votes at all . " Very well , " Goldberg said in effect . " We hold to the principle that the delinquents are wrong . But the U.N . has important things to do . We wo n't press our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a solution of this sort , he is generally able to get Johnson to go along with him . Once the session convened , it confronted once again the problem of Communist China . Gold-berg 's efforts to block Peking 's entry were successful without being inspired . On the day that he spoke against China in the Assembly , debate and deportment on both sides were unimpressive . A man from Cambodia . an oval of Southeast Asia that lies between Thailand and Vietnam . spoke first . " If the U.N . continues to recognize the pseudo-government ( Nationalist China ( installed by the U.S .. this organization will founder , " he warned . Before leaving the podium he added in soft French that the CIA has been using South Vietnamese " disguised as agents of North Vietnam to commit acts of murder and rape . " The next speaker was Liu Chieh , the ambassador from China , or at least that China which the U.N . recognizes . China minus 700 million people . Liu walked toward the head of the great hall , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slab wall someone has painted a white and red and black amoeba . As he neared the microphone , all over the floor men began slamming shut attach ? cases , buckling satchels , getting up and walking out . They trudged noisily to exits near the rostrum . Before poor Liu could even utter " Mister President , " he had lost almost half his audience . All of the Communists and some of the neutralists had gone . Liu could have spoken with the fire of Pericles over the dead of Athens and he still would not have reached half the world . What he did say , almost pathetically , was , " The Civil War in China is not yet ended . Rebels are in control . But the basic traits of the Chinese people , reasonableness. moderation . tolerance will prevail . . Arthur Goldberg applauded Liu and then , after the walkers had returned , a Martini or two to the good , he approached the microphones himself to defend the American position . This is the sort of thing that brought lines to Adlai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . It wounded him to have to argue that it did not . But no hurt showed on Goldberg . He is an advocate , trained in the adversary system of law . I 'll state my side , you state yours . and somewhere in between , a jury may find the truth . Goldberg was doing what every lawyer does  --  expounding and defending a position , which may not be the precise position he privately holds . Loudly . in his flat Chicago voice , Goldberg told the General Assembly that admitting Communist China now would be yielding to blackmail . Logically and doggedly , he continued to make points that covered 12 single-spaced typewritten pages . He feared the Red Chinese might subvert the U.N . He feared that admission might encourage Peking on its present path of violence . He spoke of self-determination , the Charter of the United Nations , goals of law and peace for all men and . without striking a single phrase of beauty , satdown to the applause of the delegates who could be expected in advance to applaud him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fedorenko was doing the same thing for the other side . " There is no need to examine what has been presented as argument by the United States , " Fedorenko said , It was diffuse , be added . choleric and inconsistent . Those delegates who could be expected to applaud Fedorenko did so , and it would have been difficult to tell from the public performances that the two nations which probably would least like to see the extremists from Peking seated on the Security Council are the Soviet Union and the United States . ( " We worry , " remarks a diplomat from the Soviet bloc , " that the Mao-ists might try to take apart the United Nations stone by stone . " ) A few clays later the General Assembly rejected Peking by a tie vote of 47 to 47 . This was victory for Goldberg without much satisfaction . " Every year . " warned an African afterward , " China gets closer . Next year . you will see , they will get in . " " The position of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson line , " is that until Communist China establishes itself as a peace-loving country , there is no place for it in the United Nations . " What Goldberg does concede , significantly , is that Red China is an important power beyond the U.N . He has put the United States on record as favoring universal disarmament , even if that means that American delegates must sit at the same bargaining table with Chinese Communists . This is a major step and a practical one . " We have to consider in any preparatory disarmament group , " Goldberg says . " not only countries with nuclear weapons . but those with nuclear capability . " The prospect of the U.S. and Russia disarming while Red China builds bombs chills the marrow , and Goldberg is generally credited with having brought President Johnson around to his point of view . The largest new crisis that confronted the U.N . was Rhodesia 's unilateral declaration of independence from Britain , Since the Rhodesian government represents a handful of white settlers , the neighboring states of black Africa demanded that Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Security Council resolution that urged Great Britain to act . The council , whose membership included two African nations at the time . was in loose agreement that the proclamation of independence was deplorable and that it was Britain 's place to override it , But debate stalled on the question of time . The Africans wanted immediate intervention . Britain wanted to begin with indirect pressures , such as embargoes . The Russians . meanwhile , wanted to talk about imperialist colonialism and the French wanted to abstain . Just before the resolution , originally offered by Bolivia and Uruguay . came up for a vote , Goldberg reworked a critical phrase into utter ambiguity : " The council . " the resolution now read , " determines that the situation resulting from the proclamation of independence by the illegal authorities in Southern Rhodesia is extremely grave , that the United Kingdom Government should put an end to it and that its conlinuance in limy constitutes a threat to international peace , . If the critical phrase had simply read " continuance , " the British would have vetoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 f the iihrase had not mentioned any dangers of a continuance , the African nations , possibly with I Ile joining , would have voted against nst the resolution . With cfmllnuance in lime , the resolution passed , I I to 0 , France abstaining . " I voted for this resolution , " said Radhakrishna Ramani of Malaysia , in subsequent discussion , " but as finally adopted , it falls far below my government 's expectation of what ought to be done . . . I do not wish to diminish a tribute to the ambassador of the United States , whose talent for persuasiveness is a special quality , but the linal form of the text might mystify , if not wholly confuse , the world at large  --  and by the world I mean the English-speaking world . Continuance in time is inartistic , almost illiterate . " " I was , of course , very interested in the comments of Ambassador Ramani , " Goldberg told the Council . " For myself , I would merely say that eloquence is always desirable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The greatest disagreement , the most dangerous condition confronting everyone , is. of course , the Vietnamese war . It is not Goldberg 's war , any more than it is President Johnson 's war . It is not a war that makes much sense to our allies . But it is a war  --  and a diplomatic position  --  behind which the United States has placed all of its prestige . During much of the recent General Assembly meeting . the American delegates and the American position were ridiculed . " You have taken over half a man 's house . " said a neutralist , " and now you say to the man : ' Let 's talk . ' One does not talk with an intruder . One throws him out . " The French were delighted to point out that the war was ridiculous , but after all , what could be expected of Americans ? The Soviets were happy to discuss America 's imperialist aggressions . In the corridors and lounges of the U.N . even our best friends hinted that we should get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blundering in Asia . Goldberg was not able to make many public debating points . He repeated Johnson 's phrase that the U.S. was ready to negotiate on Vietnam anywhere , any time , without preconditions . Even as he did . U.N . lounges buzzed with a story that posthumously quoted Adlai Stevenson as saying the U.S. had turned down a negotiating offer , carefully arranged by U Thant , the Secretary General . Thant is esteemed in the U.N . and Stevenson was admired . No debating points could be made against a truly neutral world leader and a respected dead man . But in private . Goldberg 's great pragmatism , his instinct for the practical . and his mobility abruptly became important toward the conclusion of the Assembly meeting . Amintore Fanfani of Italy , the President of the Assembly , had heard quietly from two Italian intellectuals that Ho Chi Minh . the president of North Vietnam , was seriously interested in arranging a peaceful settlement . " If America agreed to a cease tire . " Ho reportedly told the two , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fanfani quickly prepared a letter for Lyndon Johnson which he delivered to Goldberg . who dispatched it to the President at the Texas ranch . Things did not go smoothly . A newspaper printed the secret as a U.S. rejection of Ho 's proposal : the State Department then announced that it was " studying the Hanoi feeler. - Diplomacy collapsed then , the victim of premature publicity . But it did not die , nor was it meaningless for the future . A few days later Arthur Goldberg was on television saying that now we were willing to consider the North Vietnamese points . " We may not agree with them , " he said . " We have points of our own . But we are prepared in negotiations to discuss Hanoi 's ( four basic ) points . " Thus , possibly , hopefully , the United Nations was able to move the Vietnam war away from escalation and toward the conference table .

Particularly in view of the univpularity of such samples of U.S. foreign policy as the Dominican int lion and the Vietnamese war , Goldberg has made an excellent beginning . After one session of the General Assembly , that is all it is , a beginning . " Come up to my office , " Goldberg had said in the limousine , and now , in the office , he was more inclined to discuss beginnings than ends . " Look at this . " he said .

" ) . A painting by Mrs. Goldberg . a non-representational artist , radiates strong colors from one wall . " My father . " Goldberg was saying , " left Russia in an unusual way , across Manchuria . He entered the United States in California and in 1894 he walked across Texas . He was a peddler . He sold what he carried on his back . Imagine that . Crossing the whole state of Texas on foot . " Joseph Goldberg . the father , traveled all the way to Chicago . where he married Rebecca Per-stein and made a living delivering produce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Joseph , was three years old . It was a gutter-poor childhood that Arthur Goldberg recalled in the big office with the signed pictures of two Presidents . He had to go to work at 12 as a delivery boy in a shoe factory . But he stayed in school . Benjamin Harris High . Crane Junior College . and then , working nights in the post office and working on vacations in a construction gang , he put himself through Northwestern University Law School . He graduated at the head of his class and , by special dispensation , was permitted to take the Illinois bar examination before he was 21 . The rest of his story is more familiar . There was labor law through the 1930 's , when he represented the Chicago Newspaper Guild , the Steelworkers. the Packing House Workers . He married Dorothy Kurgans in 1931. and the couple had two children , both now grown . He served with the OSS in World War II . and afterward his practice gravitated more and more toward Washington . He became general counsel to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A.F.L.-C.I.O. merger in 1955. an event Dorothy marked with an abstract painting . His special gift was mediation . Businessmen were glad to see Goldberg at the bargaining table . Usually this meant no strike . " There is n't any single secret to mediation , " Goldberg was saying in his office , " but primarily you have to understand not only that the other fellow has a point of view but that he probably has pretty good reasons for having it . That certainly carried over from labor to here . But , of course . labor , like management , works within the framework of American government . Here we have nations with all different schemes .

" He spoke of dissent , it Vietnam peace march , as being distinctly different from dissension , Well then , how lid he fare with his own dissents on foreign policy within the Administration ? The answer came back short and tough . " I have my say . " The talk went smoothly until suddenly and abruptly the ambassador ran out of time . The door to the big office closed , leaving him alone with State Department papers and a phone that would not stop ringing and an appointment hook so crowded that he displays it with delight . Soon it will be 21 years since the United Nations , 50 countries celebrating their own survival and the pyre of Hitler , gathered in San Francisco to write a charter .

" Arthur Goldberg says , almost as if he were trying to convince himself , " not discouraged . " ?
