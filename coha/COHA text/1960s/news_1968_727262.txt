txt Specially trained United States agents have begun boarding Florida bound air line flights in an effort to thwart the epidemic of hijackings in the sky , the Federal Aviation administration disclosed today . Twenty men , armed and incognito , began boarding selected flights after a National Airlines jet was hijacked on Wednesday , said Paul Boatman , FAA area director . Orders Are Told " They have orders not to take a chance , " Boatman said . But he added that their training , received at the Border Patrol academy near Harlingen , Tex. , could prove valuable . Other men also are being trained there , the FAA official said . Boatman termed the special agent plan potentially more effective than assorted suggestions received by the FAA ranging from teaching stewardesses karate to putting a trap door on the cockpit floor to dump the hijacker . Could n't Tell Difference As to checking passengers for arms as they board , Boardman commented : " An electronic device could n't tell the difference between a revolver and a brassiere fastener , so we would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of thing . " As to the karate plan , Boatman said ; " The stewardesses I got complaints from their boy I friends . " Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro 's sister , Juanita , Who lives in self-exile here , asserted Castro agents are behind most of the hijackings , " in order to sow panic " and for propaganda purposes .
