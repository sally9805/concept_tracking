him . What she was experiencing at the minute was nearer the passion of a mother than of a sweetheart . She could not look at the whole of his body , physically could not . She had seen him , then her eyes had of themselves turned away . Every instinct , feminine as well as virgin , repudiated this swiftness , cried out for initiatory steps , for postponement , for time . His eyes were closed . By this act he shut her away from everything she knew about him , everything she had made a journey to join . This body , this great marble body , stretched like a corpse the length of the bed , what had she to do with it ? Yes , she had to do with it . Though she had never expected it to be presented to her like this , and did not now want it , still she took another step nearer the bed . This war was stranger than anything she had ever dreamed , still it was her war . " Tom ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , eyelids unmoving , his voice kind and emotionless . She took one more step . A floor board creaked under her foot . Down on the street , open ended to hills and sky , the wind swept around the solid masonry of the hotel with its long anguished cry of emptiness . Oh , nothing , nothing but the wind ; and this building , a fake , to fool the wind , with its semblance of a human habitation , but it , too , empty , deserted , filled with transients as separated as though it had never been built , and the persons its walls hid faced each other on a dark mesa , the wind off the mountains blowing strong and icy between them . The wind in its long sweep , how many cabins , rooms , beds , men , women , did it sweep around ? How many lamps did it smoke ? How many candles gutter ? How many shirttails , left overnight on careless lines , did it tatter ? How many cattle , shivering , turned their rumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of these objects at a moment when she needed ties : its currents washed them all . By what chance was she islanded here in a room full of apples and dry grasses and goldfish with a great strange unmoving statue ? The smoking lamps , the lonely cabins , the forgotten clothes , the huddled cattle  --  all these she knew : with any of these she would have been at home . By choice , by determination , by lying , she had made her home with strangeness . There was a sandy spatter of sleet against the window ; the wind , fair-minded in its lonely destructiveness , was willing to give other elements a chance . She went to the window and pushed it up . Let something happen , she asked . If we are to be frozen in this room , let us be truly frozen . The wind that blew the curtains aside broughtp101sleet with it . The street below was now empty . Those living on the lower floors of sorrow had gone home to experience sorrow at higher levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leftovers of the standard meal . She turned to face the man on the bed . If he felt the wind or the sleet , he gave no sign . He lay unmoving , stretched out to it , willing to accept whatever came to him . She did not shut the window , but she did begin slowly to take off her own clothes . The wind offered her the touch she had lacked . She took her clothes off to something , for something , because of something , in spite of something . She was helped by it , buffeted by it , stung by it . She began once again to tremble . The wind took away her selfconsciousness . Naked with the wind was more modest than clothed with a statue . With it she was a tree or a wheel . The lights in the room still burned as bright as when Tom Mount had entered , days and years ago , smelling of this very wind and sleet . She stood in front of the window , and if anyone across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror . She had no fault to find with her body , except to have it of an entirely different kind . If a woman was to be tall and dark , broad-shouldered , big-bosomed , long-waisted , her way was likely as good as any to be these wrong things . She undressed , and seeing herself in the mirror , let down her hair . Not for modesty 's sake , though her hair was heavy enough and warm enough to be useful for both . She let her hair down because it went with her nakedness . She let it down the way a painter adds something to the corner of his picture . I am not so miserable as I thought , she told herself , as she pulled out the pins , able to see that nakedness and hair skewered up in a knot do not go together . But she was miserable enough . She held her breath with the cold ; there was a sucked-in place the size of a washbasin underher ribs . Her bones were as naked to the cold as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the worst of all was her separateness and her consciousness . She had not come here to be alone , to be left out in the cold . She wanted to forget herself and to remember only Tom Mount . He spoke to her from the bed . " Pull down the window . " There was no hint in his voice of the fifteen-minute silence he had kept . She pulled it down , though she missed the wind . A quiet cold was worse than a noisy one , stealthier , deadlier . " Shall I pull the blind , too ? " " No , not the blind . " " The lights ? Shall I turn out the lights ? "  | " Not unless there 's something in this room you do n't want to see . " There was something . His body and hers . " Come here , baby . " She went to the bedside . " You have frozen us both . " " Yes . " " What good did you do by that ? " " No good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes were closed again , and she thought , When he is dead he 'll look like this , blue under the eyes , big sharp beak , lips with the shape of teeth behind them . She leaned forward and laid her cold cheek against the big cold box of his chest . " Dear love . " " Help me , baby . " Help him ? Help him what ? She was the one who needed help . " I will help you , " she said firmly , promising she knew not what . Warmth was the first help she knew how to give , and she extended her arms , mantled him with her flesh and her hair . " Help me , " he said again . " I will , I will , " she declared . He was asking her what she felt capable of providing . His request was a child 's to a mother , a pupil 's to a teacher . With those words , he returned her to a world she knew , to lamps in the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten on the line . Help ? Help was her whole stock in trade . She clasped him more closely , warmed him , cradled him , rocked him . She closed her own eyes , as they say of those dying , calmly , and there was nothing in the feel of his encircled body she did not feel born for . " Help me , baby . " Then he showed her what he meant by help . She hung for one moment equal , poised between running and staying . If thought could have transported her , she would have been instantlyback under the eaves at Millstone , under Opal 's comforter , dreaming some more familiar dream . Her mind went there . Her imaginationdenying where she was and what she did made it possible for her to stay . She embarked upon the fatal division . In her mind she spoke words that repudiated what she did , and words were what counted , were n't they ? And beyond this justifying division lay the help of her mulishness . She would finish this , spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recovering from it , forgetting it , but she would not run away from it . This was her war , and if it was a foolish or wicked or forbidding war , well , all right , it was hers and she wouldp103die in it . Only she wished the window were open and that the wind swept round her and cried with the sounds she could not make . Opal , who had finished her supper , looked across at Eunice . " That 's the first time I 've heard you do that since we came to the Tract . " " Do what ? " " Groan that way . " " I was thinking of something else . " " I know you were . " When Eunice did not answer , Opal said , " Why do you want to get mixed up again with something that makes you groan and cry ? Why do you want to start it all up again ? All that suf-fering ? " " Opal , it was the only happiness I ever knew . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whim . " " I gave up my home for a whim , then ? " " I did n't know it then . Opal , I 'll explain this to you if I can . I think I owe it to you . " " You do n't owe me anything  --  least of all explanations of how you feel about Tom Mount . " " I want to explain . I do n't think you and Charlie ... " " You 're right about me and Charlie . But I know a few things I never picked up from Charlie . I 've been to a few beauty parlors and quilting bees in my day . I 've heard a little talk in my lifetime . I do n't suppose anything you could tell me would come as a surprise . " " I did n't intend to tell you anything surprising . . . only that afterward ... " " Afterward ? Oh yes , afterward . How about before and during ? " " Before ? " " Afterward is anything you make up to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got a little time then . I know all about afterward . " " You do n't . You ca n't . " Do n't I though , Opal thought . She watched the big dark girl rememberand search for words . She let her struggle . She let the brown eyes go black and the skin tighten over the cheekbones and the mouth despair . Let her try to tell it and find out what words would do to that story . Let her cut afterward , and before and during , too , down to size with words and hear with her own ears what she plans to throw away her life on . There were n't any words for that crazy man 's woman-likep104power of gentleness and his woman-like power of lasting and his woman-like interest in every remembered how-it-was or might-havebeen , and all this tied , till it broke your heart with contradictoriness , to what rose from him so unwoman-like it took an increase of womanlinessto contain and no going away but an oncoming which it took a night to kill and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of dying into life , the truth that living in the morning , after death in the night , was a resurrection , oh , Jesus , to lilies in the valley , to a room where fly song was sweetest music and a chair shadow the shape of thrones , and all around you hummed a silence that had at its center the two of you and you not caring about anything any more because what more was needed , once you were a fact ? There were no words for that . Try to put it into words , tell somebody how it was , and it 's gone , gone . Tell me , Eunice . Hear for yourself and wake up . Spit it out . Make it no bigger than a sentence . Then eat your peach pie and drink your coffee and live with things we got words for . " Tell me , Eunice , " she said . " Tell me all about it . I admit I 'm ig-norant . " " I do n't know that I can . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some things are sacred . " " We ought n't have run away from something sacred , had we , Eunice ? Tell me . Maybe it 's not as sacred as you think . " She would n't , Opal saw , take a chance on discovering that . She had to be there at the center of the humming , not standing outside of it , listening and reporting . " You 'll have to change your clothes before we go to the meeting , " Opal said finally . " You ca n't go with that tea stain on you . " Eunice looked down at the stain , brushed it a few times with her hand as if she hoped to rid herself of it that easily . The outside doors . the house had two , one in the sitting room , one in the kitchen  --  were both open , and through them and the opened windows came the nighttime 's warm sleepy harvest sound of insects . As long as they chirped , summer lasted . They felt the earth still warm beneath them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sorrow ; and the big moon , rising , was giving the wrong light ; and the soft wind was providingthe wrong touch . But these things existed not even for themselves , let alone human suitability . " Eunice , " Opal said , " we ought to be happy . We 've come a long way for that purpose . " " I am happy , " Eunice said . " Oh , Opal , what makes you think I'mp105unhappy  --  on a night like this ? He 's come a long way , too , and I 'll see him again soon . " " Have you forgotten why we left Colorado ? " Opal asked again . " No . I have n't forgotten . But I 've learned something , too . If you love anybody  --  it does n't matter what they do . You keep on loving them . " Baby-strangling , bank robbery ? " " I expect so . You never did love what they did . You loved them . It is n't stopped by acts . " Opal pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 'll clear up . We 're going to be late as it is . " As ABRICE was the first man to arrive at the meeting . He was punctual by nature , and with no wife to make love to , no car to break down , no dog to be chased by coyotes , no sweetheart to turn up out of the past , there was little to interfere with his punctuality . He left his motorcycle at home and walked from his tent to Raunce 's church tent on his own reliable legs . He listened to the wind , blowing punctuallyinland at this hour . But in his heart he believed that he and the wind alike were both essentially wild . But where is my wild act , he asked himself ? Where ? Where ? My wild act , not of defiance , but of being and doing ? I break away from the shingled bungalows , the seven-to-five jobs , the snuggeries of marriageand churches and fraternal orders , but what do I do ? My savage heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them ? I live calm under canvas . I peel myself down to the nubbin of an eye that observes and a hand that records . I turn up punctually at meetings for community betterment . He stuck his head inside the tent when he arrived there and called , " Ben . " Ben Jessup had promised to come early to the meeting ; since his car was n't in sight , he surely had n't arrived ; still , Asa wanted to make sure . " You looking for someone ? " Up front , LeRoy Raunce was arrangingyellow field daisies in a big crockery churn . " I was looking for Ben Jessup . " " Ben 's car 's probably had another breakdown . "  |p106In  the stale warmth of the tent , Raunce , or maybe it was the daisies , had a rank smell , not bad , but strong and penetrating . " How do you like the way I 've dressed the place up ? " Raunce asked , indicating a galvanized pail of blue dust flowers on the opposite side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the place cried out for something to balance them . Looks better evened up with these daisies , do n't it ? " When Asa hesitated , Raunce said , " I 'm no hand for decorating , but I can spot lopsidedness all right . " " You pick these as well as fix them ? " Asa asked . " I had a little time after I got home from work . " Raunce 's energy was a byword on the Tract . Asa himself was no slouch when it came to work , but he knew he could not hold a candle to Raunce . Raunce worked nine hours at the oil field ; came home and carpentered or painted for a couple of hours ; then he wound up his day reading the books prescribed by the Rose Park Elders . They did not have to urge LeRoy . If God had spoken in burning bushes , opened up seas , ordered plagues , produced doves , provided chariots , brought water from rocks , LeRoy wanted to know about it . Asa thought , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear too much about God . LeRoy read the Bible six nights a week ; twice on Sunday and once on Wednesday he preached , sharing what he had learned from his reading with his neighbors . " Oh , friends , " he would call out , leaning in his eagerness over the little homemade pulpit , " God sent a chariot down to pick up Elisha . He will do as much for any one of us . " Asa had gone three or four times to hear LeRoy preach . He gave Raunce and his sermons the same attention he would have given any other natural phenomenon . Raunce wrestling with the word of God was as interesting as a tarantula fight any day . There was the same life-and-death determination in the performance . The word of God usually won , a sign , no doubt , that Raunce fought fair . Asa had no stomach for what the man preached , but the man preaching , that was another story : the man committed , illuminated , transfigured . By what ? By something invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act ! That believing and declaring . Asa regarded Raunce with the same envy he had for Indians and eagles , for all creatures unseparatedfrom themselves . " Are you going to have some part in the performance tonight , LeRoy ? " he asked . " Perkins asked me to sit up on the platform with him and Wendlinp107Jessup , and open and close the meeting with prayer . I 'm willing to pray , but I 'm not going to do it from this platform . I 'm not going to lend the pulpit to the Perkins Investment Company . Anything I 'd say from up here would sound like an amen to Syl 's excuses for not delivering us the water he 's promised . " LeRoy , as soon as he had his flowers evened up to suit him , left the tent . " Hate to waste the water , " he said , " but I got to do a little washingup before the meeting . I appoint you the reception committee till Syl gets here . I do n't want to see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit , and since I do n't intend to do it , there 's no use our going through all that again . " LeRoy did n't make his escape any too soon . Asa heard Raunce 's screen door slam a few seconds after he heard the approaching car . LeRoy probably sprinted that last fifty yards , Asa thought , and he wished he could have seen him . When he went outside , Syl had already turned ofd his engine . Asa was glad to see that Syl was not pretending to be a rancher among ranchers . Asa 's first meeting with Sylvester Perkins had taken place in the Los Angeles office of the Perkins Investment Company . A salesman on the Tract had told Asa , when he tried to buy the arroyo , that it was not for sale . " Nonsense , " Asa told him . " Everything out here 's for sale . They 'd sell the coyotes if they thought anyone would pay for them . I want the arroyo . " The arroyo , technically , was a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and the salesman , whose inclinations were all towardpicking up as many commissions as he could , nevertheless had no choice but to send Asa in to see Perkins himself . Asa made the trip into Los Angeles on his motorcycle . On the Tract , Asa wore bib overalls , an article of clothing other young unmarried men left to middle-aged heads of families . They thought bib overalls about on a par , for men , with Mother Hubbards for women : something you put on when your shape was better guessed at than revealed . Asa was slim-hipped and gaunt-tailed enough to be in no need of any disguise . But he was extremely logical , and logic led him to bib overalls . They were practical : the bib protected the shirt ; healthful : no belt to stop the circulation ; economical : they lasted longer than Levis . So he wore bib overalls . Los Angeles , however , Asa recognized , was not the Tract . He was not one to court attention , so he put on whatp108he considered a city costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching khaki-colored cap . The cap had goggles attached by Asa himself , with the help of elastic carried by stores for girls ' bloomers . Asa rode into Los Angeles on his red , well-polished Indian motorcycle , feeling as conventionally dressed as a banker . The outfit was conventional , but the convention it suggested to Sylvester Perkins 's secretary was that of a delivery man of some kind , and it was thus she reported him to Mr. Perkins . Sylvester Perkins had nothing against such men . He was democratic for the soundest reasons  --  it made him money ; but he was also busy , and it was not until Asa sent the secretary scurrying back with the magic words " Tract " and " buy , " that Syl said , " Show him in . " " Tract " and " buy " meant that Asa was one of " Syl 's people , " and Syl felt like a father to " his people . " Asa had no inkling of this ; and he had never set eyes on a man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off with one of the performers ignorant of the part he was expected to play . Asa thought of himself as a land buyer and of Perkins as a man with land to sell . Perkins thought of himself as a combination pioneer and Father Christmas and of Asa as a boy whose stocking he might fill . It took them both a little time to get their parts straightened out . Syl 's first desire was to let Asa know that selling real estate was far from being his primary interest . He did so , of course ; and he made money at it , of course ; he had to live , like anyone else . But it was not by chance that he was making ranches available to buyers on terms that made it possible for men who had never owned property before to do so . It was his business ; he was a subdivider in the same way another man was a grocer or a lawyer ; but it was also his mission . After he had made this clear to Asa , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his windows : twenty miles away across the Los Angeles Valley , the purple saw teeth of the Sierra Madres bit upward into the blue sky . " Now you see where I get my trade-mark , do n't you ? When I moved into this office , there they were , waiting for me : Mount Lowe , Mount Wilson , Old Baldy , an entire unused mountain range . I thought to myself , If fate can be for me , the least I can do is to be for fate . I deal in top values in land , and here are the tops in land . Nothing I could have arranged and paid for could have been half as effective as these natural reminders of this fact . All it took on my part was a willingness to see . That , fortunately , I have . I had the silhouette of those moun/taintops used at once in all of our advertising and on all of our stationery . You 've seen how the Prudential Insurance Company uses the Rock of Gibraltar ? That 's British territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure California , used to remind us that when it comes to ranch land , California and the Perkins Investment Company top all rivals . The words underneath , Where the snow-crowned golden Sierraskeep their watch o'er the Valley 's bloom , ' are from our state song . I bet you did n't know that , Asa . " Asa confessed he did n't . " All free , all native California , all good things to keep in mind . The height of our mountains , the words of our songs , the opportunities offered by the Perkins Investment Company . " " Those are n't actually the Sierras , are they ? " Asa , who knew they were not , asked . " A mountain 's a mountain , " Syl said . " What about the Valley 's bloom ? There 's not much of that yet on the Tract . " " Time , " Syl said , " time , time . That 's all we need for bloom . " " And water , " Asa reminded him . Syl admitted this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of time , " Asa said , " but you will have to produce the water . " " I accept that responsibility , I accept it fully , " Syl said . He looked out the window . " I ca n't credit my eyes when I look out there . Our trade-mark right across the sky . " Asa smiled . He believed Sylvester Perkins was convinced that the trade-mark had come first and that the mountains were an imitation . " We have a little ceremony here in the office at this time of the day , " Syl said . " We call it the changing of the colors . ' We drop all work and watch those peaks as the colors change on them . " Asa knew those transitions from blue to rose to mauve to gray by heart , and he certainly had not lost a half-day 's time and ridden twenty-five miles on a motorcycle in order to look at them through a fly-specked office window . He wanted to buy an arroyo , and he did not need any sunset thrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence at this hour , he should not be in his office . An office was a place of business , and Asa had business to transact . He had no more stomach for mumbo jumbo with mountains and sunsets in a real-estate office than he would have had for them in a groceryp110store . Without even bothering to face the mountains at which SylvesterPerkins and his secretary were gazing , he said , " I want to buy the arroyo on the southwest corner of the townsite , the one that circles the bottom of Reservoir Hill  --  at that point . " Without moving his eyes from his trade-mark in the sky , Syl said , " It is n't for sale . " " Why not ? It 's not worth anything to you . " " By the same token , it ought n't to be worth anything to you . " " We do n't use the same tokens , Mr. Perkins . " Sylvester Perkins had been taken aback by this , but impressed . He did not discover that Asa 's plans for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after he had sold him the arroyo for next to nothing as unusable land . When he did find out , the fact tickled him . He thought Asa was an eccentric ; but any eccentricwho could best Sylvester Perkins had Syl 's complete respect . The minute Syl was out of the car , he called out , " How 's life at the bottom of the gully , Asa ? Any peanuts ripe yet ? " Syl introduced his wife to Asa , and Asa was pleased with her appearance . Louella appeared , with her carefully selected colors , her unnaturallywaved hair , her unmoving face , unreal to him , something fabricated and requiring study . " I ca n't make a speech unless I see Louella in the front row encouragingme , " Syl boasted . " The truth about me does n't matter a whit to Perk , " Louella said , without any tone of complaint . " He makes up whatever suits the story he 's telling at the moment . " Asa had never heard Sylvester Perkins called anything but Syl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That 's my wife 's pet name for me . " Louella made no comment . On their honeymoon her husband had asked her to call him Perk ; she did not know why then and had never since inquired the reason ; but she had never from that day called him anything else , and this difference between his public name and his privatename suited her very well . The public thought he was Syl while she knew that he was Perk . " What kind of a turnout do you think we 'll have tonight ? " Syl asked . " If everybody who 's dissatisfied with the water situation shows up , " Asa said , " the whole Tract 'll be here . "  | " They do n't think I 'm handling it right ? " Syl asked good-humoredly . " That 's what they intend to find out tonight . " " Good , " Sylvester Perkins said . " I 'm glad to hear it . That 's exactly what I hoped for . Asa , I want every man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Tract . Fighting me , if necessary . That 's the way I planned it . They 're wrong in this case  --  but that do n't matter . It 's the principle that matters . As long as they 're for the Tract , first , last , and always , why , I tell you , Asa , the sky 's the limit out here . We can have a paradise out here , an organized , well-run paradise . " " Irrigated , too , I hope . " Syl laughed . " Yes , siree , bob . An irrigated paradise . " Louella was always amazed at the way Perk could take the wind out of his opponent 's sails . A man could come to Perk with what appeared to her to be a genuine grievance , find himself in the wrong in ten minutes and struggling to justify his actions . Perk had the power , just by being quiet and asking a question or two , of letting a man get in bad . To do so , he must have logic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a logic and a reason that , at the beginning , Louella never saw . She was always a fool and victim with the man to whom Perk was giving enough rope to hang himself . And usually she , too , was given enough rope for a good throttling , if not a completehanging . " Have you seen Wendlin Jessup ? " Syl asked . " He 's going to presidetonight . I 've got a few things I want to talk over with him before the meeting starts . " " I have n't seen him , but I 'll tell him you 're looking for him if I do , " Asa said . " Fine . You do that , Asa , " Syl said , and moved on to greet other settlers who were now beginning to arrive. 14 1 x E NIGHT was warm and the moon was full . This was a meeting for grievances , and the settlers planned to get down to the brass tacks of complaining and demanding in due time ; but meanwhileit was a social occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first chance the women had had to put on a dress a little more flashyp112than was suitable for church ; to survey and to size up ; to begin to play the parts that might be theirs for the rest of their lives . Nothing was settled yet . To whom did they feel superior , to whom might they have to truckle ? They came filled with emotions they wanted to use , and were searching for suitable objects on which to use them . They had a store of love , scorn , hatred , reverence , pity . They wanted to laugh , cry , anticipate , be surprised , excited , transported . They wanted to feel others moved by their glances , by the mere shape of their cheekbones ; they hoped there would be significance for someone in the particular breast pin they wore , in the tremulous breath with which they framed a hesitating sentence . Asa , still on the lookout for Ben , stood at one side of the tent opening , watching the arrival of his neighbors . He knew most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up in a buggy , open to the night air and the stars . Asa went over to greet them and to ask about Ben . Ben 's father , Wendlin Jessup , was sixty ; Ben 's mother , Mary , was somewhat younger . Asa believed Wendlin Jessup had , not the finest or handsomest face he had ever seen , but the clearest . It was not a matter either of color or of features , though the man did have , with his high color and silvery thatch , a kind of old farmer 's handsomeness . Asa , who could watch a ground squirrel with pleasure , relished Wendlin 's assortment of colors and planes as such . But they were less than half of Wendlin Jessup 's story , were not , in fact , the story at all , but only the page on which the story was written . Asa plagued himself wondering what that story was . The man was religious , an old-line Quaker ; but Asa had looked into the face of many a religious man without being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried chicken and talking about sin . He was not sure that goodness was what accounted for the clarity in Wendlin 's face ; perhaps it was singleness of purpose . The same purity might perhaps be seen in the face of a cannibal chief whose good it was to pursue , catch ; and eat his enemies  --  if he had been wholehearted about the pursuit of this good . Wendlin 's face was as innocent of contradictoriness as a pond . There was nothing in it , minuteby minute , to figure out . You would look at it once in a while , the way you did any pleasing natural phenomenon , but there was no need to do so in order to keep track of Wendlin . He was what he had always been and would be . He had taken his stand . Wendlin jumped out of the buggy with an old farmer 's stiff jauntinessand went around to help his wife down . Mary Jessup was no one'sp113idea of a Quakeress and not many people 's idea of a lady . She was a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have subsided some years back into a graying quietness . Instead , while her yellow hair had faded and her skin had developed a slackness it had not had at sixteen  --  or even forty  --  this old Quakeress , or old lady , or old tigress  --  whatever she was  --  did not take to age any more noticeably than the ocean . Ancient of days , if you wanted to count the days ; but who , at the seaside amidst wave and spray , wanted to concentrate on that aspect of his holiday ? Asa knew no one , male or female , religious or irreligious , more likely than Mary Jessup to call a spade a spade . He was a spade-caller himself , but there were some matters from which he habitually turned his eyes . Not Mary . She was in some ways an unlikely partner for Wendlin and an even more unlikely mother for Ben . Asa cared more for her than for any other woman he had ever known . When he went to the Jessups ' , he went there , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not much of a talker , though he was a great jokester . Asa was not sure why , but Wendlin 's joking made him suspicious of the old saint . Joking was a means of bearing things that probably ought not to be borne . It was a device for avoiding suspicion . Say something true , but in such a way that men laughed , and they would forgive you for it . By God , Asa thought , I do n't want to be forgiven for a thing . Mary was full of good humor , an easy laugher , but no more capable of a joke than the sun . She got out of the buggy with none of Wendlin'sjaunty bounce , but flowed , all feminine flounces of striped blue and white , over the step and so down to the dusty earth . She turned to Asa without any salutation . " Is that preacher here ? " " You mean Raunce ? " " Do n't tell me this Tract 's blossomed any others ? There 's going to be more shepherds than sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex of some kind . " " Raunce was here a while back . He went home to clean up . Do you want to see him ? " " Not him , especially . But I brought some cookies and a couple of pounds of coffee . If the Raunces will let me use a kettle  --  or a big Suetenecan  --  I 'm fixed to provide the crowd with some refreshments . " " That 's quite an undertaking , is n't it ? " " Maybe so . But it seemed a pity on our first get-together that there should n't be something to eat . "  | " By the time this meeting 's over , " Wendlin told her , " you may not be able to find any two people willing to break bread with each other . " " Bread , maybe . But they 're not going to be able to turn down hot coffee and ginger drops . " " You women do n't know anything about us men and our principles , Mary . " " Maybe not your principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I admit . But your appetites , that 's a different story , and crystal clear to every woman . Hand me that coffee bag . " Wendlin fished the bag out of the back of the buggy . " Mary puts the Bible to shame , " he told Asa . " She undertakes to feed the multitudes without benefit of miracles . " Mary hurumphed , but was not shocked . The Quakers treated the Bible like an almanac , a book helpful for daily living but not so holy you could not put it and a joke in the same sentence . Asa had no stomach for professional do-gooders : ladies in favor of teetotalism or men trying to cleanse the world by doing without meat . Missionaries and reformers had the sour smell of a root cellar toward spring . He hated to get to the windward side of them . Mary Jessup was an exception . She was full of good deeds , but she was as sweet as running water . She did her good deeds , and once they were over , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past minute 's breath . She enjoyed making ginger drops and coffee for others the way most people enjoy making money for themselves . Asa forgave Mary Jessup her goodness with his whole heart , and smiled , watching her set off toward the Raunces ' place , as bountiful and unpremeditated as a harvest . The crowd , while Asa had talked to the Jessups , had been growing . The moon , which had floated free of Old Saddle Back , dimmed the illumination provided by Sylvester Perkins 's lanterns . Syl himself stood near the tent opening , greeting settlers like a father at a holiday home-coming . Some appeared to relish his greeting ; others gave him a wide berth . He was rich , and they all owed him money . This was enough to make some resentful and suspicious . Tala Camp , an old lady whose single interest in life , as far as Asa knew , was china-painting , chatted with Syl for several minutes ; the Irby Wagners , Mrs. Wagner twice the size of her husband , sailed past him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brood of towheads , which included a second wife who looked as if she had been picked to suit an already established color scheme , went by nodding and smiling , butP115too diffident , until Syl laid a hand on Nard 's arm , to take up the Tract owner 's time . The Mexicans , Pete and Rosa Ramos and Julian Ortiz , stood some distance from the others , quiet and watching . Asa wondered why they had come . Just for the party of it , he supposed , since they owned no Tract land and had no water troubles . Asa raised his hand in salute , and the two men responded with smiles . Pete Ramos had the spreadleggedstance of a man with heavy shoulders and narrow hips . And there was a fullness in the firm-muscled flesh at the corners of his mouth which Asa associated with power , though , as far as he knew , Pete had none and wanted none . Ortiz was another make of Mexican : a young man with a silky mustache and a brow wrinkling upward under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lightened his fine-boned face . While Asa watched the Mexicans , the Basil Cudlips arrived , gave the Mexicans a wide berth and paused in an uneasy cluster , like hornetsfixing to swarm . They were as black as the Fitzgeralds were blond . The young Cudlips scattered to lark around with the other children , playing ante-over over the tent with wild gourds and rolling tumbleweeds like hoops . Base Cudlip scanned the crowd as if looking for someone . Asa had always been of two minds about the story a man 's appearance told . He did n't believe a low brow showed a lack of brains or a small jaw a lack of will power . Still , he had observed too many animals not to know that there was some connection between character and appearance , though animals had n't man 's power to disguise character by changing their appearance : black hearts hidden by big smiles , and shyness covered up with booming voices . If those were the signs , Base Cudlip was neither blackhearted nor shy . He neither smiled nor boomed . Silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard-shadowed jaw enough to say howdy and to ask Wendlinwho was in charge of the meeting . " What do you mean , in charge ? " Wendlin asked . " I 'm going to preside , if that 's what you mean . " " I do n't mean that . Who has the say-so about who comes ? " Raunce , scrubbed clean , but still smelling of paint and the turpentinehe had used to remove the paint , joined the group , and Cudlip turned to him . " It 's your tent . You got the say-so , Reverend ? " " Anybody can come to my tent , " LeRoy said . " It 's open to all . " " What 's the trouble , Base ? " Wendlin asked . " Wo n't they let you Cudlips in ? "  |p116It  was one of Wendlin 's jokes , and it tickled Asa , but Basil Cudlip did not crack a smile . " We 're in , all right . The question is , do we want to stay ? " Wendlin , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make things easy for him . He would have to come out with the dirty facts himself . " That 's something you 're the only one can decide , Basil , " he said , and showed he had dismissed the whole subject by starting a conversation with LeRoy . " I hear you 're ready to begin work on the new church , LeRoy ? That right ? " But Cudlip , though one of Raunce 's faithful listeners , was not going to be sidetracked by church talk . " What I want to know is , who asked those greasers here ? " Asa listened to hear the reply to that . There was none . LeRoy and Wendlin could not have looked blanker if the question had been put to them in Hindustani . Cudlip saw the blankness , too , and changed his word . " What are those Mexicans doing here ? " " Pete and Julian ? " LeRoy asked . " I do n't know what their names are . " " They got names just like us , Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yours and mine , I grant you . " " I do n't give a damn about their names . All I 'm interested in is  --  who asked them to this meeting ? " Raunce said , " They 've got a right to be here . This meeting is open to everyone . " " Nov we 're getting somewheres . Who said it was ? " " Sylvester Perkins is the man who called the meeting . " " Perkins do n't care who he sells land to . " " I hope that 's true , " Wendlin said . " Oh , it 's true all right . I know for a fact he 's sold land to a Jap . The chief reason I pulled up stakes to come West was to get shut of niggers . Look at that fellow . " He pointed to Pete Ramos . " I 've seen plenty of niggers lighter skinned than him . I did n't travel three thousandmiles to run into a bunch of watered-down blacks . If I want niggers , I want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Looks like you better be heading back then , " Raunce said . " I 'm not heading back . But I 'm not taking things laying down either . Where 's Perkins ? If you fellows do n't accept the responsibility for them being here , I want to find somebody who will . "  | " Oh , we accept the responsibility all right , Base , " Wendlin said . " We accept it fully . " " He speak for you , too , Asa ? " Base asked . And Asa , realizing that he alone of the three men had said nothing , felt the need to say somethingstronger than the others to make up for his silence . " He speaks for me . I do n't go to any meeting where they 're not wel-come . " " Well , that lets me know where you three stand . That makes it all clear . I 'll speak to Perkins on my own hook . I 'll fight my own fight without help . " He walked away , a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian . " LeRoy , " Asa said , " tell me how you figure on making a Christian out of a man like that ? " LeRoy 's fleshy big-boned face was troubled . Basil Cudlip was a faithful , paying , praying member of his congregation . Saved and sanctified . " I do n't know , " he said . Then he added , " Except treat him like a Christian . There ai n't no other way , is there ? " he asked Wendlin . " No . Not so long as we treat Pete and Julian the same way . " " Oh , I know that . And it do n't bother me any , turning the other cheek to Basil Cudlip . But I do n't cotton to Pete and Julian having to turn theirs . " Wendlin put a hand on LeRoy 's arm . " It 's their Christian privilege , LeRoy , " he said , " as much as yours . If they want it . " " I know that , Wendlin , " he said humbly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiness . " 15 AT THE tent church , Chad Lewis , with no building to lean against , leaned against a wheel of the Lewis 's wagon , listened to the horses , Diamond and Chinopsee , munching away in their feed bags , and watched the settlers arriving for the meeting . They all irritated him , and he endured the misery of feeling that his irritation was unjustified . The other young people were playing games with the kids , trying to bridge the space between strangeness and acquaintanceshipp118with running , loud noises , collisions ; with the artificiality of choosing up sides , of pretending animosity for pretended enemies . The grownups ' bridge was talk . " So you 're from Ohio ? My husband was born just outside Wilmington . " " How many barrels of water do you use a week ? " " You 're located over on the west side of the Tract , are n't you ? " " What do you think of Sylvester Perkins ? " That was the kind of talk they had , and Chad thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't please him , his own silence did n't please him . I 'm a born kill-joy , he thought . They had driven over together , Ben Jessup and the rest of his family , tender and cooing as doves . But not silly , nothing he had any right to hold against them . They were just happy , that was all . He had listened to them like a rock that longs to be human , but does n't know how . His mother had ridden with one arm across his father 's shoulders , the other snuggling Zoomy . Zoomy was still full of Old Silver . He had been able to figure him out a hero in spite of everything . Chad himself had sat on the back seat between Ellen and Ben Jessup . For all of those two , he could have been a stone . He did n't know what Ellen had to be so happy about . Her own words appeared to delighther . She lingered over them as if parting with them was almost more than she could bear . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't fill the eyetooth of a bird . But she had seen one recently , and with that to go on , she was an expert . Ben Jessup had encouraged her . He had taken her ignorance like a jewel , polished and examined it ; it would take some plain talk from big brother to get her straightened out again . Women did n't care whether there was any truth in what they said ; if a man listened to them , that was all they asked . " A ship of land , " his mother had said , and because that struck his father 's fancy , she did n't examine the idea for truth . The first fact about a ship was that it was made for travel and capable of motion . The fact was , he hated himself and the life he was leading . He hated himself because by wanting much he got so little of what he wanted . He defeated himself and all his resolutions , day by day and night by night . He saw his mother making for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wagon and slashing up the horses , he did n't know any way of escape . Even by moonlight , the girl was n't pretty . And she was as far from springing toward him as he was from springing toward her ; but with his mother 's arm through hers , she did n't have much chance to balk .   " Chad , " his mother said , " here 's somebody else who does n't like games . " " I like games all right , " he said , nipping that bond in the bud . " Here 's somebody who is n't playing games . " He did n't see any way to contradict that , so he kept his mouth shut . " Chad , this is the Reverend Raunce 's daughter , Crystal . " Crystal . Oh God , he thought . Crystal Chandelier Raunce . Seventeen crystal water goblets . Oh , my precious watch crystal , let 's break the glass and buy a new timepiece , " Howdy , " he said . " Chad , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in private . Excuse us , please , " she said to the preacher 's crystal daughter , and she put a strong thumb and forefinger between the muscles of his arm and led him up to the heads of the horses and whispered over their munching and the yells of the ante-over kids , " She was alone and crying , Chad . Now you be nice to her . " He did n't ask her , Why do n't you take her to Ellen ? They both knew why . First , Ellen did n't need anybody ; second , misery loves company ; and third , whenever possible , kill two birds with one stone . His mother did not take any chances on his escaping , but marched him right back to the girl . And the girl , who had had her fair chance to escape , had not taken it . She was still there . It meant something to him , though he would never have admitted it , least of all to her . His mother said , as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Neither replied . They were somewhat united by their shared silence and discourtesy . His mother started to leave , then hesitated , like somebodyat a sickbed , fearful lest , the minute her back is turned , the patientwill die , But she had to chance it , trust them to stay alive together . The girl Crystal began by accusing him . " I suppose you feel sorry for me . " The one he felt sorry for was himself . He had n't wasted an iota of pity on her . " Nope , " he said . " Why should I feel sorry for you ? " " Did n't your mother tell you I was crying ? " " That 's what she said . But my mother 's a well-known liar , " he added indifferently . " There were tears on my face , " she admitted . " But that 's not crying . My poor old mother , she sees tears and thinks that means crying . " " You 're not crying if you do n't make any sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing . Nobody said you was sobbing . What you were doing is crying . If you shed tears , you are crying . You go around giving different names to things than other people do and what they 'll think you are is crazy , not crying . And they 'll be right . " " They 're the ones who are crazy . " " That 's what crazy people always say . " " How do you know ? " He laughed , in spite of himself . He did n't like her but he was glad to laugh . He was always handing out laughs to other people , and nobodyever thought to hand him one back . He took another look at her . If asked what was wrong with her , he did n't know what he could say . They had run out of conversation and needed someone to help them part as much as they had needed someone to bring them together . They faced outward from the wagon , watching the talking grownups and the playing children . There was one girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Tract anyway ! " Chad exclaimed , looking at this self-possessed nonplayer , and was ready immediately afterward to bite his tongue out . " Even if you are n't " was what this had said , and while it was the truth , he knew plenty of truths he intended to keep to himself , particularly the mean ones . He was too mixed up with a lot of mean truths himself . The preacher 's daughter did not flinch . " There are two pretty girls on the Tract . The one you 're looking at is Medora Cudlip . " Medora Cudlip , like themselves , was neither playing with the kids nor talking with the grownups ; but unlike them , she had not slunk off to hide her aloneness . She stood out in the open , calm and visible as a lighthouse , and let the ante-over players who swept around her figure out for themselves how to avoid a collision . He tried to make amends to Crystal . " Pretty , if you like them dark , " he said , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty per cent was that he did . The preacher 's daughter  --  he could no more think of her as Crystal than he could think of her as china or cast iron  --  was evidently used to playing second fiddle . " I expect you 'd like her . Most people do n't . " The minute they had something to talk about , Crystal proved herselfjust as contrary as he had guessed she was . She left him for Me/dora , but instead of bringing Medora over to him , as he had expected , she linked arms with her , and together the two girls walked into the tent . S H E L LEWIS entered the tent with three of the five he had driven over to the meeting . Chad had disappeared the minute they had arrived without so much as a by-your-leave ; Ben Jessup had stayed long enough to say , " Thanks for the lift , " then he , too , had left . Once inside the tent , Shel made the place they would sit a subject of study . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcame it . He was finished with living like that , with hovering on the edges and hoping for the longed-for . It was his intention to claim the longed-for . The tent was as seething with movement as a can full of worms . There was a smell of people who obviously had no water to waste on bathing ; but there was a smell , too , of stubble fields and of sage hills and of dusty , sun-soaked , roadside flowers . Shel felt like a man going to a show of some kind : he half expected to see minstrels in blackface or Chautauqua ladies in sailor hats singing a boating song . Or maybe , he thought , I feel like old Ben Franklin , getting ready to draw up the bylaws for his country . Some country , he smiled to himself , recalling the Tract 's brown hills ; some Franklin , too , for that matter . But he remembered Ben with the loaf under his arm ; so though Ben had traveled faster and farther than he had , their start had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the aisle , letting them see and be seen . Zoomy and Ellen were red-cheeked with excitement . There was a big heavy pulse at the base of Ellen 's throat , and Zoomy held his mouth open , the better to take the wonder in . Shel guided Joicey with a light finger on her arm . He felt so tender toward her , he had a hard time not making a show of his feelings . But that was another of the things he was against : men fondling their wives in public , like pets bought and paid for ; huddling up against them in church like old rams huntingwarmth on a day of pinching cold . Joicey understood ; he 'd been at pains to see that she did , so that she would n't think , seeing others at their hand games , that the inclination was n't in him . It was in him ,  |p122all  right , but he 'd honor this woman in public in a courting way , nothinghis by rights . Every touch would ask , not take . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't sure how Joicey would take her second sight of Rosa and Pete ; or how Rosa and Pete , now clothed and upright , would greet them after that earlier , embarrassing meeting . That earlier meeting could have been a funeral or a wedding , something public and ceremonial , for all the self-consciousness anybody showed . Even Joicey , her feelings now tempered by knowledge of what they all shared , was gracious as a weddingguest . He made Joicey acquainted with Mrs. Wendlin Jessup . Wendlin himself was up front with Sylvester Perkins and LeRoy Raunce , arrangingprocedures . Mary Jessup reached up and took Joicey 's hands in both of hers . " I 've got a daughter who looks a sight like you , " she said . " I 'm glad you 've come . You 'll make me less homesick for Paula . " " Where is your daughter ? " Joicey asked politely . " China . Away in China . She 's a missionary . I 'm so proud of her . Help me with the refreshments tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shel was as proud of Joicey as could be , recognized as reliable the minute she set foot on the Tract . It was his intention to take his familyright down to the front rows , but Joicey , after they left Mary Jessup , whispered to him , " Shel , let 's sit where we can see people in front of us . " So he began to hunt for four seats together and maybe near someone he knew , so Joicey could get a start in her neighboring . It was Ellen , not he , who saw the people they could sit with . " There 's Mr. Mount , Papa . We can sit behind him . " Mount was with Lute Cope . " Where 's your girls ? " Shel asked Lute , after the introductions were over . " Your oldest and my girl here must be about of an age . " " Press is seventeen , " Lute said , " and at home I get to thinking of her as a young lady . But get her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the youngest . That 's where she is now . What 're you doing , sitting in here with us old folks ? " he asked Ellen . Shel held his tongue , hoping Ellen would find hers , and , for a wonder , she did . " I can play ante-over any time , Mr. Cope . " Lute laughed . " You got a real politician here , Shel . Or coquette , I 'm not sure which . Preferring our company to ante-over. "  | " And saying so , " Tom Mount said , turning around to smile at Ellen . " That 's what counts . " " You better run her for the school board or something , Shel , " Lute said . " She 'd be my only chance to make it . My oldest boy 'd rather bite a nail in two than be caught saying a nice word to anybody . " " He playing ante-over , too ? " " Not Chad . I do n't know where he is . " " How old 's he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water situation here ? " " He do n't know there is a water situation . " " Me either , " Joicey put in , killing two birds with one stone : defendingChad and proving she was n't tongue-tied . " Wait till you start hauling water , Mrs. Lewis . Then you 'll know it . " But Shel was not going to let her off that easy , pretending she did n't know there was a water situation . " It 's like this , Joicey , " he said , not that he had n't said it before , but this was one time she 'd have to listen , or pretend to , " everybody on the Tract got a share of water stock with each share of land he bought . " He waited to let this sink in . " That clear ? " " Yes , " Joicey said . Then , as an afterthought , she asked , " What 's a share of water stock ? " Lute Cope laughed . " What 's your answer to that , Shel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver to each acre of land a fifth of a miner 's inch of water . " " What 's a miner 's inch ? " Joicey asked . " You sure make me homesick for my wife , Mrs. Lewis , " Lute said . " I did n't know how lonesome I was for talk like this , " " It 's enough water per acre to irrigate citrus stock . That 's all youneed to know . We bought it and we paid for it and we have n't got it . " " Maybe Perkins fooled you , outright , " Tom Mount said . " Maybeyou 've been sold a gold brick . " Shel bridled . " There 's water , all right . We did n't buy blind . We know what the water levels are , down by the Santa Ana where the wells are being sunk . " " What 's holding them up , then ? " " Workers are hard to get , steel 's hard to get . The rainfall 's been thep124lightest in years , so the pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perkins 'd better get you up there on the platform with him . To help excuse him . " " I 'm not excusing him , but I 'm not fooling myself about facts either . Water wo n't come out of any made-up story  --  on our side or hi The fact is , we bought land and water , and the land without water is just about as useless as the other way around . Maybe more so . I 'd rather eat fish than ground squirrels . " " You found that out ? " Lute asked . " Two thaws is enough to learn you that , Lute . " " So you plan to be reasonable ? " Tom Mount had swung around in his chair , and Shel examined hi face . It was a big tired face tonight , and Shel noticed for the first time that the eyes , which in daylight appeared deep blue , were hooded with a film of white . Mount 's question was in order . He was asking for information . But there was some slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake , drinking the water somebody else hauled , did n't have the right to come by information so easy or to care so little which way the answer went . Do n't he know he 's asking us about how we plan to live and die ? Do n't he know that when he says reasonable ' that way he 's like a man watching a fight and egging the fighters on ? Shel ha . no idea what was in his own face , but some of his thoughts must have shown , for Tom Mount 's face pinked up a little and his eyes mShel 's finally unveiled . While Shel was unraveling his own thoughts about Tom Moun Lute Cope gave Mount his answer . " You got any better plan , Tom ? " How about fighting ? " If there was going to be a fight , Lute Cope was the man , in Shcl 's opinion , who ought to head it up . He was the right age  --  Shel supposedhim to be ten years his senior  --  he was better educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the ins and outs of people , and he had his own land , which meant he had his own money and his own future to think about , too . Shel did n't intend to take a back seat  --  unless he saw a man clearly marked to be up front . He thought Cope was that man , and he was ready to enlist under him . There were other men on the Tract he admired . Raunce was a hard worker , but crazy as a grasshopper and spitting Bible texts like tobaccojuice . Asa Brice was in some ways another oddity ; though what was odd about minding your own business , growing sweet potatoesp125instead of oranges , and watching birds instead of courting girls , he could n't say . It was this last that made him wonder . Any man past twenty not married or trying to marry struck him as a halfway suicide . That man either had been scamped in his make-up or he lacked imagination . Either way Shel did n't fathom him . He wondered some about Tom Mount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , he did n't strike him as a bachelor . There were plenty of people who took Wendlin Jessup to be the Tract 's leading citizen , but Wendlin was too calm and easygoing ; he 'd make a joke of anything . If you had to lose , be on Wendlin 's side ; he 'd teach you how to smile while eating crow . I do n't plan on needing that knowledge , Shel thought . Base Cudlip , on the other hand , did n't have a calm , easygoing bone in his body . Shel looked across the tent to where Base sat , reared up amidst his younguns like a crested cock . The man had rubbed him the wrong way . They were from the same state , and Shel worked against his instincts to give the man his due . What 's the matter with you ? he asked himself . You want to be the only Kaintuckcrowing on the dung heap ? Ben Jessup was maybe the best man he 'd ever known . Shel had a lot of respect for goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on Jesus Christ , which might fit him for the pulpit but not for leading a fight for water ; his model , being One who had turned water into wine , might give Ben the idea a miracle would serve here . Shel did n't think they could afford to bank on it . No , Lute Cope was the man , and Shel , having elected him , was on the point of giving him the news and giving him his hand , too , saying , Captain , I 'm Lieutenant Shelby Lewis reporting for duty . In his own struggle toward self-reliance , Shel could still use a model . He had a bump of veneration on his skull . He had a yearning for nobility . He could accept  --  he 'd had to  --  the meanness and nastiness of the human race , but , by God , what he hankered for was a man who could rise up , steadfast in the face of it , and conquer it . He was still hurt , admit it or not , by that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was still hunting examples to refute him , men whose lives would say to him , Shel , you do n't have to be a man like your pappy . Shel made a halfway motion of his hand to touch Lute , get his attention , and say plainly what was on his mind , " I 'm behind you , Lute , I 'm backing you up . You can depend on me . " But by the time he 'd steeled himself to be so outspoken , Lute was busy with two ladies who were asking him if the seats on the otherp126side of Tom Mount were being saved . Shel looked up into the faces of Eunice Fry and Opal Tetford . " I was saving them for Press and Hannah , " Lute , reluctant to seem discourteous , said hesitantly . Opal was equally reluctant to have Lute blaming himself . " There 's lots of other seats , Lute . Do n't you worry . " The meeting had obviously excited these ladies ; the chance for a little party had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not much more noticeable than a tree or an outcropping of stone , was all ablaze , a tree on fire or an outcropping blasted open to show a vein of gold . Shel stared at her , forgetting to introduce his family . He was abashed before so open a display of feeling . He felt he should warn her that the occasion was not up to it , that starting out at this pitch , she was in for a disappointment . She had her excuses , he knew ; those two ladies had been living a hard lonely life , doing a man 's work in getting their land cleared and their house raised . Still , this was a meeting for water : it was n't Christmas , the Fourth of July , or a June wedding . And he did n't overlook , either , the fact that the two seats they 'd picked were , just by chance , next to the only two unaccompanied men of a suitable age in the tent . In their shoes , living a womanless life , he reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But able still to breathe through my nose , I hope , he thought , looking at Eunice 's opened mouth . He introduced Joicey and the kids . Eunice gazed at Joicey ; no , she gazed at the two of them , at him and Joicey , as if entranced . He did n't know what was so remarkable about them ; they were neither one beauties , a mill-run married couple , perhaps a little happier than usual tonight . Eunice continued to stare at them in smiling satisfaction , as if they were Exhibit A at a zoo , as if she could now go home and say " I told you so " to somebody . Joicey , since the ladies made no motion to leave , said , " If you 'd like to sit with us , I 'll ask the children to move up front . There 's still plenty of chairs up there . " Opal would n't hear to it , but Eunice would . She thought it would be very nice to get acquainted with Joicey and said so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too nice a girl to let it show much . Zoomy was willing to move anywhere and the oftener the better . Shel and Joicey stood up , the children squeezed out , the ladies squeezed in . Shel had conscious flesh tonight , and , without looking , he saw Eunice Fry steady herself with a lingering hand on Tom Mount 's shoulder asp127she passed behind him . Tom Mount , evidently thinking someone wanted to speak to him , turned around . The tired hooded eyes of the water discussion had completely disappeared ; color burned in his cheeks , and under the surface blue of his eyes were layers of purple and violet . Seeing that it was only the Fry woman , he turned back without speaking or changing expression . But Shel was so impressed by the change in the man he wondered whether it was actually there , or whether his own eyes earlier had mistaken what they saw . The meeting was about to come to order . Raunce had joined his wife in the front row . On the platform , Wendlin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick " and " Be quiet , " were eying the stragglers . Ben Jessup and his friend Asa Brice also made a bid for the seats Lute was saving and were sent on up front to look further . They settled for the two beside Ellen and Zoomy , and Shel was glad . He knew Ellen was of an age when her pride  --  he thought it was her pride  --  made her enjoy the attentions of a young man in public . AFTER Crystal left him , Chad felt lonesomer than ever . If he had been nice to Crystal , he could now be talking to the prettiest girl , or , at the very least , the second prettiest girl , on the Tract . He leaned back against the wagon wheel , shut his eyes , and wondered what he could do with his life here in the hills . He was n't a born farmer , like his father , and so far he did n't have the education for anything else . He would have to help his father through the clearing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away : where and to what , he did n't know . His father was content to own his own land , to make a living . There was a step beyond that , and he intended to take it : not just make a living ; starve , if necessary , but be himself , do what he alone could do . Whatever that was . In his eagerness to repudiate the old life and begin the new , he took a step , eyes still closed , forward . By God , he thought , I wo n't be stuck here . As he moved forward , he was crashed into , and , except that he was still anchored by one hand to the carriage , would have been knocked down . He opened his eyes , but he could n't see  --  and whoever had ' run into him was now using him as a prop to lean against . His head rang ,  |p128his  lip was split , his teeth felt loose in their sockets . The minute he got breath and sight back , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had received . Before his sight cleared , it came to him that he was being leaned on by a girl . He opened his eyes , and because the girl still had her eyes closed , he had a good chance to look at her . What he saw caused him to swallow as much blood as he could and to try to lick his lips clean . His anger disappeared automatically . So this was the way a girl looked when she was beautiful ! Immediately , he felt that with this girl looks did n't matter . She was the soul of beauty , and with . the homeliest face in the world would still have been irresistible . The girl opened her eyes , and what looked out from her eyes and trembled on her lips would , he knew , transform any face in the world . He had never in his life felt such tenderness . She put her hand to her forehead . The blow that had split his lip had been delivered by her forehead ; a knot like a clenched muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed away from him . He , whose hands had ached so many times to touch a girl , any girl whatsoever , now had , through necessity , to touch this beautiful one . It was his duty to steady her , support her , hold her upright . She was as alive and soft as any small animal , any rabbit or squirrel or kitten . He had misjudged the way a girl would feel . Their clothes were misleading . He would never have guessed that you could feel them so much beneath all their layers of clothing . She could have been naked , for all he was aware of cloth . She sank against him , limp as a stunned bird , and rested her head in the hollow between his neck and shoulder , a hollow he deepened for her comfort by rounding his shoulders . He put his arms clear around her , but very lightly . He could feel the lift and fall of her bosom against him . Over the shoulder of the girl he held , he saw Crystal , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight at him . He did n't mind if she considered him a fast worker . He did n't mind the other way either . The girl in his arms lifted her face from his shoulder . " I think I am going to be sick to my stomach , " she said . There was nothing he knew more about . Zoomy threw up as easily as he swallowed , which was easy . The first thing needed for puking was privacy . Even Zoomy , not very shy about some things most people did in private , did n't like to puke in full sight of anyone . Chad led the girl gently behind the wagon , put one of her hands on a wagon wheel for support , and then turned away , prepared , for her sake , to be deafp129and blind . He could n't help hearing , and she sounded so pitiful in her misery that he went to her and put a steadying hand against her cold damp forehead . She leaned against his hand , far too sick to worry about his being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got their canteenfrom the carriage , so that she could rinse her mouth ; after her mouth was rinsed , he gave her his handkerchief for a towel . She wiped her face and hands and stopped her swaying . His entire body ached for the return of her touch , but short of another accident , he did n't k now whether he would ever be able to touch her again . There was some bond , though . He could feel it and he could feel her reluctance to leave . She said , " I wo n't give you back your handkerchief . I 'll take it home and wash it and iron it . " Those were the sweetest and wisest words he had ever heard in his life . Now they would meet again , and she had figured out a way . That they would meet again seemed , for a second , all he wanted in t his world ; but as soon as he had that , he wanted more . He wanted her to stay ; but his fear that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single word that would detain her . She had no intention of leaving him . " Your lip is bleeding , " she said . " Oh , no , " he said , " no , it 's not . It 's nothing . " But when he saw she intended to wipe away the blood with his handkerchief , he willed himself to bleed again . She was very gentle . " I ought to be shot for being so awkward , " she said . " Crashing into you like a streetcar . " " Oh , you were n't awkward . It was all my fault . I had my eyes shut or I could 've sidestepped you . I might 've killed you . How do you feel now ? " " Empty , " she said . He laughed for the second time in an hour . Poor Zoomy , he thought , he tries so hard , and any girl evidently can tickle my funny bone withouthalf trying . " What 's so funny ? " she asked . " You , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his own daring . But she was not defeated by his silence or his awkwardness . He began to relax , to trust her . She was not going to leave him and she would make things easy for them while she stayed . He waited on her How ; he let her alone without any help ; she would bring them a subctto talk about . She brought the horses . She walked to their heads ,  |p130looked  them over , and said , " This is the most unmatched team of horses I ever saw . " He laughed again , in the way his father did n't like , silently . He took the feed bags off the horses so she could see the full extent of their unmatchedness . " What are their names ? " she asked . " This one , " he said , putting his hand on the black 's muzzle , " is Chinopsee . " She echoed the name , as he had hoped she would . " Chinopsee ? What a funny name for a horse . " She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get up , Chinopsee . " The black pricked his ears in her direction . " It 's an Indian name . It means blackbird . " " Does he skim along ? Does he fly ? " " He skims and he flies . " " We would n't call a black horse ' Blackbird , ' would we ? " " We ? " He repeated the word , for a second breathless with its intimacy , with her linking of the two of them . " White people , " she explained . " Oh . No , we 'd call him Nigger or Blackie . " " What 's the name of the other one ? " " Diamond . " Diamond was a dapple gray , flashier than the black , a horse to pull the lord mayor 's coach . " Which one do you like best ? " Even her questions show how unusual she is , he thought . He had often speculated about Diamond and Chinopsee , about their differences and what caused them . So far as he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in these differences or in his speculations about them . As he began to answer her question ( and it was because she had asked it , or because she was listening ) , he was filled with a profound knowledge of horses and their habits , a knowledge he had never had before . As he spoke and she listened , the sounds of people talking , of children playing , became faint . The girl and he were alone under the great sailing moon . The two horses by their side were quiet , except for an occasional jingle of harness ; the crickets and katydids at their feet chirred in the nighttime warmth and light . He told a story he was amazed to hear . What he had to say about horses seemed to have meanings pertinent to the whole world . He was clearing up mysteriesfor himself as he went along.  |p131If  you got to the bottom of one subject , did the truth about all other subjects lie there , too ? If you knew one thing fully , did you , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers and coon hunters were so wise ? Once before in his life he had been drunk . At the age of sixteen , he had sampled a jug of raw corn whisky . He had felt a kind of power at the time : as if he had transcended himself , were suspended above himself . This enabled him to see a lot of the world ordinarily not visible ; he saw also his own smallness in this world . Now he was drunk again , but in an entirely different way . He was more himself than he had ever been before ; and this was happening at the very minute when he was also more aware of another person than he had ever been before . How could this be ? It contradicted all the rules of arithmetic . To give himself away and to have more left . He felt like saying his own name over and over again : Chadwick Lewis , Chadwick Lewis . That was who he had been , but might never be again ; for this girl was making him over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . He was not delivering a lecture on horses . He could never have done it without her . She taught him all his powers , showed him all his meanings . Until she asked her questions , he did n't know his answers . He had never in his life felt so radiant . She looked at him , she asked . He spoke . Something towered upward out of the interchange ; together they opened up meanings he had never glimpsed before . About horses ? That was the subject , but the night and the clear dry Western stars , the world and the Tract , her soft body and his supporting one were not excluded . When he gave his attention to the words they spoke , he was amazed ll over again . There was nothing in them . " We were fooled with Chinopsee . He 's a saddle horse . " " Wo n't he work ? " " In his own way . He wants to lope . " " I like to lope . " " Horseback , it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or with anotherhorse . Or plowing . " " Does n't Diamond like it ? " " Diamond does n't want to be part of a team , even . Diamond wants to do everything alone . He pulls nine-tenths of every load . This old blackbird lopes along for the fun of it . " " What does Diamond think of that ? "  | " Sometimes he balks . Feel here . " He took her hand and guided it under Diamond 's belly to the hairlesswelts . " Feel those ? " He felt her shudder all along her arm . " What are they ? " " Scars where a fire was built under him to make him move . " " Who did that ? " " My father . But he put out the fire . " He still had her hand , which he had guided to the scars . The sounds which earlier had dimmed had now ceased altogether . The people had gone inside . The meeting had begun . She swayed in his direction as she had done when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her face distinctly . It was lifted to him serenely . He leaned to her , and they kissed , very gravely and quietly , as though takingan oath . They drew apart , though he still held her hand , and looked at each other . Girls had been much in his mind lately . He had spent entire nights , it seemed to him , thinking of them : not only thinking of them as flesh , but as flesh separated into distinct and hiddenparts . He had felt dirty a good deal of the time . How could he have guessed that he could be cleansed of this feeling by holding a flesh-and-blood girl in his arms ? For she was in his arms now . It was nothing whatsoever like his imaginings . She was not arms , legs , breasts , but a person . Tears came to his eyes . The only act he could think of now that would be worthy of her and of his own feelings would be to die for her without her ever knowing it . They did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly and gently , then drew away from him . " My father will be worried about me , " she said , " if I do n't come . " He watched her run toward the tent . She ran with the same headlongspeed that had carried her crashing into him . She has not learned a thing , he thought , smiling . And he did n't want her to . He decided not to go into the meeting . The proceedings would interfere with his thinking about her . After a few minutes , it came to him that she was at the meeting and that inside the tent he could look at her as well as think about her . Crystal Raunce , an usher for the meeting , met him when he entered the tent . " What 's her name ? " he demanded , " Whose name ? " " Whose name ? " He did n't understand how anyone could be so dense . " The girl I was with , of course . "  | " Why did n't you say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not say her name without smiling . Smilinghurt his lip , and he put his hand to it . " What 's the matter with you ? " Crystal asked . " Did you get in a fight ? " He was already trying to locate Pressley Cope . " A fight ? No , I had an accident . " He could not help smiling again , even though it hurt his lip . " A lucky accident . " Crystal watched him going slowly down the aisle . Four hours ago , she had said , " I am Crystal J. Raunce . I do n't need another person in the world . " Now she felt as if her evening had ended as he walked away from her . When Press joined her father , as breathless and excited as Eunice had been , Shel was convinced that there really must be somethingqueer about him and Joicey . Press Cope also stared at them , turning around in her seat to do so . She was white-faced , her eyes looked feverish , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg . Tom Mount , who sat next to her , spoke to her . Either Press did not hear him or decided to ignore him . Eunice Fry leaned forward and touched her shoulder . " Mr. Mount is speaking to you , Press . " Press said , " I 'm sorry , " but did not speak to Mount . Instead , she said to Shel , " Do you have a son ? " " Yes , " Shel said , not bothering to mention Zoomy . " I 've been talking to him . " Shel said , " I 'm glad to hear it . It looks more like you might have been fighting him . " " Oh , no , " Press began , but her father shushed her . Wendlin Jessup was on his feet , waiting for the crowd to quiet down . Asa Brice 's heart sank as he saw Wendlin get to his feet . Up to this time , the Tract had been a certain section of rolling hill land in SouthernCalifornia and no more . Its people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all looking out for themselves . Men had stood on barley-stubble hilltops and planted the acres below them with their eyes and picked oranges with their imaginations . Men saying , " I 'll make out . Me against wind , weather , and the Perkins Investment Company . " Now they were going to band together , everyp134man willing to be a little less in order to get a little more . Now they were going to adopt rules and frame regulations . Now they were going to elect officers and appoint committees . Now they would extend the right hand of fellowship  --  but only on official occasions : in lodge halls and chamber of commerce meetings and at church suppers . Asa felt as if he were attending a funeral . Farewell to the wild land : the land open to road runners and trap-door spiders , to winds and fogs , to cactus and greasewood . The land that had been free to voyage silently under the stars , subject to nothing but its own laws , was going to be made to earn its keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral , then it was a wedding , and something sweet was going to be wed to something coarse . The union was going to be blessed by Raunce , who , at a motion from Wendlin , had risen to his feet . Now is the time , Asa thought , for me to stand up and give my reasons for believing that these two should not be united in holy matrimony . Speak now or forever after hold my peace . He held his peace . He knew the reasons and he held his peace . Raunce 's prayer was short . Thanks to God for these gifts , and a petitionthat His gifts be used for man 's good and God 's glory ; which , Raunce said , were one and the same . Amen . He sat down , taking the audience , prepared for something much more long-winded , by surprise . All of the audience , that is , except Base Cudlip , who was on his feet the minute Raunce sat down . " Mr. Chairman , " he called out in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like a pendant crab apple dangling at the close of each of his words , " I 'd like to have the flo-ah . " Old Wendlin smiled . He could not have looked more benign , but the flo-ah was nothing he intended to relinquish to Base Cudlip . He had a surprisingly strong voice when he wanted to unleash it , and Cudlip 's tenor was smothered under its big rumble . " Mr. Cudlip , motions from the floor are not now in order . Ladies and gentlemen , let us all stand and unite in singing My Country ' t is of thee . ' " Cudlip , who was already standing , appeared , as he was joined by the others , to be a leader instead of a dissenter . He could not , under the circumstances , sit down , but he was far from happy joining in . Asa , with pleasure , watched him scowling and squirming . Wendlin had him boxed in for the time being , anyway . Either Cudlip 'll keep his mouth shut or mingle his singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself no singer , turned about to watch those who were . Ellenp135Lewis sang " Land of the Pilgrims ' pride " as if she had herself set foot on Plymouth Rock . " Sweet land of liberty , " her father sang . You are met here to sing away your liberties , Asa thought : farewell , sweet land of springtime flowers and autumn fallow . Farewell , sweet land of coyotes and road runners , of Mariposa lilies and soapweed and yellow violets . But who are you for , Brice , he asked himself , the land or the people ? What would you give to be able to trade your arroyo for Ellen 's tears or Shel 's belief ? He opened his mouth to sing . He could n't do it . He had n't joined in anything like that for too long a time . Two men stayed on their feet as the singing finished and the others sat down : Sylvester Perkins and Base Cudlip . Before Cudlip could get in a word , Perkins said , " Mr. Cudlip , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed on to me . The answer is : One and all . This is n't my answer alone . It 's Reverend Raunce 's answer . He owns this tent . He 's the chairman of this meeting . You 're welcomeand so is every other resident of the county . Or the state , for that mat- ter . We 're pleased to see the widespread interest this Tract is arousing in men and women from all walks of life and to have as many as are interested in attendance . Does that answer your question , Mr. Cudlip ? " " It does , " said Mr. Cudlip , and without more ado he got his wife and children onto their feet . With them standing , he added , " And this is my answer . " Then , walking behind his family like a drover behind cattle , he nudged his little herd outside . Wendlin Jessup , as they left , said , " It 's the second Secession , folks . " The crowd laughed , but they noticed , too , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent . In spite of Wendlin 's joke , Cudlip 's leaving was embarrassing . This was secession before a union had been established . If they could not even get started together , how were they going to carry on together ? If Sylvester Perkins felt any uneasiness , he did not show it . He let the Cudlips file out . He let his audience wait . He stood up there , his very lack of any marked superiority reassuring them , and let them wait on him . He was their reason for being here , on these hills and under this tent . Without him , they would be in other states and under other roofs . Then , with his first sentence he surprised everyone . " How many of you today have thought of the war in Europe ? I do n't mean worried about it or prayed over it or shed tears over it . I mean given it one small thought . " He threw this out at them , and Asa saw the sudden indwelling/ness on the faces around him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their forgetfulness and accused themselves of selfishness . " Last month , on a single day the British lost sixty thousand men on the Somme . " The faces , as Asa watched them , said , We could 've spared them a thought . We could 've taken our minds off weir boxes and standpipes for the space of a minute . We could 've remembered that blood is thicker than water . Perkins 's listeners went that far with him . But only that far . Already Asa saw other questions forming in their minds : How 's our going without water going to help them ? They wo n't die any easier because we 're thirsty . Perkins may be a humanitarian , but he 's not selling the Tract for humanitarian purposes . He 's here to make money . That 's all right . We 're all here to do that . But if Perkins is planning to make his at our expense , he ca n't blind us to it by remindingus of our shortcomings . They waited for his next words , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have thought about it today . It 's been on my mind most of the day . But I 'm not standing up here taking credit for that . In my shoes , you 'd all be thinking of it . This is something I 've never mentioned . It was n't in my mind to mention it tonight . But we 're all mixed up here together . You 've told me , a lot of you have , anyway , about your problems and your troubles . This is n't a problem , though it troubles me . I have . . . we have a son in Europe . An only child . He 's twenty . He joined the Canadian army a year ago . The Canadian artillery . There 's a big push on all along the Somme battle front . That 's where our son is . " Asa was disgusted . He had the sensation of having watched a man pursued by wolves throw his only son to them . " As I said , " Perkins went on , " perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? I 'm proud of him . And it 's a fact that some of our setbacks here on the Tract do n't bulk as large in my mind as they ought to in the face of what he  --  and other boys like him  --  are up against Over There . I mean , here we have this and that difficulty we had n't figured on . At the moment , we do n't have enough water  --  and it 's a real drawback . I grant you that . I 'm not trying to make a molehill out of a mountain . But we are n't standing up to our knees in water in a trench . We 're not living on cold rations . We 're not separated from our families . We 're not listening for the shell that 's got our number on it . Instead  --  here we are . A peaceful moon overhead.  |p137The  sweet flowers at our feet . " Perkins indicated Raunce 's galvanized pail and churn . " Here we are , living in one of the richest , most picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Against the bigger background , the world background I 'm sugresting , we look pretty lucky . Pretty lucky . " There was not a sound in the audience . " Pretty lucky . Not one-hundred-per-cent lucky . I understand some of you are getting kind of tired hauling water . That right ? " Now he got his answer . " You bet . " " That 's right ! " " What 's holding it up ? " It was too bad about his boy , it was too bad about the war , it was too bad they were all such low-down cusses they 'd let a day go by thinking of nothing but their own troubles . But they had n't come here tonight to win the war for anybody ; all they wanted tonight was to make sure they 'd get their one-fifth inch per acre  --  and get it soon . When the crowd had quieted , Perkins said , " I think the best way to handle this situation is for you to ask questions and for me to answer them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " They had questions , all right , and they laughed a little at Perkins 's question . Nobody was anxious to be the first man on his feet , putting himself forward as a mouthpiece for his neighbors . They were n't anxious , either , that it should appear to Perkins that there were no questions . A half-dozen men stood at once . Perkins recognized Shel Lewis . It galled Shel to be speaking with Sylvester Perkins 's permission , like a good schoolboy . And it offended his idea of how the mattershould be handled , his taking the lead instead of Cope . But on his feet and recognized , he had no choice but to open his mouth . " Mr. Perkins , " he said , " there ai n't but two questions here tonight . The first may take some time for you to answer . You take your time to it . The second you can answer in three or four words . The first question is : Why has n't the Perkins Investment Company delivered water as scheduled ? The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Shel had seated himself and before Sylvester Perkins could open his mouth to reply , there was a disturbance at the back of the tent . A man 's voice called out , " Is there a Mr. Luther Cope present ? " Shel turned with the rest of the crowd to see who was speaking . A young man in a collarless white shirt and wearing a peak-brimmed cap stood in the doorway . Lute lifted his hand to show his presence , and tlhe stranger said , " Excuse me for interrupting , but you 're wanted outside , Mr. Cope . "  | arrived in Los Angeles at three o'clock on the afternoon of the meeting . No one met her because she had told no one when she was coming . Being met would emphasize , she felt , that she had gone away , had left . If she simply arrived , suddenly and unexpectedly , hung up her hat and coat , unpacked her suitcase and began to peel the potatoes and set the table , her absence might appear almost dreamlike , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or so she hoped . She had come by Santa Fe from Chicago , sitting up in the coach all the way . There was no need for such economy . Lute had bought her a round-trip ticket when she left , with Pullman accommodations included . And her father had given her , as he put her on the train , $250 in cash . Lute was not hard-pressed for money , but a berth was a luxury she wanted to forego , as a sign to Lute that she was wholly with him in whatever sacrifices they must face in starting over again . She stepped off the train immaculate , wide-awake , untired . There was nothing she could not do when excited and challenged . Amidst the hot , harried , bedraggled crowd at the station , she was noticed and she knew it . Because she was naturally shy , the knowledge that she was being looked at made her uncomfortable . She felt like a woman on a stage , but without any reassuring lines to tell her what part she was playing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under observation . The more she was looked at , the more her color deepened , her back straightened , her gait became elegantand defiant . And the more she was looked at . " She 's on a mighty high horse . Be fun to take her off it . " Thus , the men . The women thought only , How does she do it ? How does she keep clean amidst the dust and soot of travel ? Energetic in the heat ? Calm in the confusion ? She was clean and she was energetic , but she was far from calm . Too self-conscious to walk slowly or look carefully , she missed the sign tellingher where to claim her baggage . She felt like crying . She had left one life behind her there in her parents ' home on the banks of the Ohio ; she was ready to begin a new one on the Tract ; but in this interval , midway between the two , she was miserable . She sat down onp139a grimy bench , unclenched her hands , breathed deeply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she seemed to have been derivedof more and was hence more appealing . A stranger in a strange place , she threw her heart , as was her nature , into the enterprise of being strange . She was not putting on an act , though as a person she was in some ways deeply and inherently an act . She had never been taken out of herself . Without this corrective , she found no relief to her feelings except in trying imaginatively to realize herself in each passing emotion . The dress she wore was responsible for some of the attention she was getting . It was a becoming and fashionable dress , but too closefittingand of a color inappropriate for travel . She had not worn it on the trip west , but had put it on after lunch in a washroom filled with women bathing and changing their squalling babies . She would not have owned such a dress , lavender summer wool , cut on princess lines which outlined her high-busted , slender-waisted figure , or have bothered to change in such trying circumstances , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indy was thirty-five years old , the mother herself of a nearly grown ( laughter . But between Lute , Lute 's mother , and the conventional protectivepattern of the small town where they all lived , she had not been permitted much experience . She had returned to her home a curiously girlish-hearted thirty-five , ready to be a daughter again to her father and mother . If she had been widowed , her father and mother would have humored this girlish illusion of hers ; but she was a grown woman and fugitive wife , and they believed she belonged in her own home , not theirs . Indy made no complaints to them about Lute ; and Mrs. Pressley , coming to her own conclusions , had urged pretty dresses , new hairdos , summer colognes , and frilly underwear upon her ( laughter . She had herself bought two dainty Philippine **26;1699;TOOLONG for Indy . " A man , even the most devoted husband , " she said , " is affected by such things . " She gave Indy a package of Golden Glint shampoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high lights in it , " her mother explained . " It needs brightening up . " Indy had believed at first that her mother was trying to cheer her up , trying to keep her from being homesick for her girls . When her mother gave her the nightgowns and the hair lightener , she understood that she was being made attractive to Lute ; that her mother was in fact trying to make sure that she should not remain a daughter atp140home . This knowledge , though it had shocked her , had had nothing to do with her decision to return to Lute . That decision was based on Lute 's willingness to move away from the town they had lived in and on her own inability to remember when she was away from Lute what it was that she held against him . There were no beatings , infidelities , squandering of money , gambling , drunkenness , indecent sexual demands . There was not even any untidiness about the house . Lute was free as a girl of the usual masculine faults . Away from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It is I who must be wrong . If I would be this way at home with Lute , all would be well . So she would leave Lute because of the intolerable empty heavyhearted life they led together , and return to him , ironically , because away from him she became another person . And this other person , in her determination to lead a better life with Lute , had hearkened to her mother . It was true that she had made no effort to captivate Lute with bright colors , sweet colognes , and lacy underwear . In the first place , Lute was already thoroughly captivated , and in the second , he either never noticed what she wore or how she was scented , or did not think such subjects suitable for talk between husband and wife . But Lute had been willing to start over again , and so would she . The lavender summer wool was the first indicationof her intentions . She was also scented with White Lilac , and shampooed with Golden Glint  --  and whatever the effect on Lute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the patrons of the Santa Fe railway . She had never before been in Southern California , let alone Los Angeles , and was uncertain as to the best way to get to the Tract . The Pacific Electric Railway , Lute had written her , ran southeast from Los Angeles as far as Whittier , and Whittier was only ten or fifteen miles from the Tract . She would take the Pacific Electric to Whittier , and , once there , she could perhaps hire someone to drive her to the Tract . But , first of all , she had to find her luggage . She got up and made herselfwalk slowly and calmly through the station , carefully reading every sign . Almost immediately , the " Claim Luggage Here " sign stared her in the face . She had , besides the grip she had used en route , a small trunk , a box , and two suitcases . While she was wondering what to do , a young man in a peculiar cap , something between a railroad engineer 's and a golfer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " are you looking for transportation for your bags ? "  |p141She  was reassured by both his youth and his cap . His cap indicated that he had a right to speak to her as some kind of a bag-mover , and his youth , even if his cap meant nothing , gave her confidence . Indy was truly comfortable only with men considerably older or considerably younger than herself . She knew how to be a daughter and she knew how to be a mother . These roles she could play with pleasure . But faced with a man of Lute 's age , a man with whom she could be neither filially innocent nor maternally wise , she did not know who to be : she did not know how to be a woman the age of a wife . This was the role she was once again asking Lute to teach her . The peaked-cap fellow was no problem . He was young and he was trying to be helpful , in the way of young men with older women . She could see he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gave her confidence . She was easily daunted by officials . " You were n't planning on coping with this stuff yourself , were you ? " he asked . Indy could not resist the pun . " Even with help I 'll have to cope with it . That 's my name . " The minute she spoke , she was sorry . Here was one place she and Lute saw eye to eye . " It plagues me to death , " Lute used to tell her , " this smart-alecky talk of yours to strangers . You 'll sit mum as death in a roomful of neighbors , then to someone you do n't know from Adam 's off ox , you 'll make some intimate remark . I know you 're not trying to show off or get attention , but that 's how it sounds . " She agreed with Lute ; and she did not understand , herself . For two days and nights , she had ridden on a train without speaking to anyone . Then the minute she stepped off the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stranger said , " We ought to trade jobs . My name is Waite . " " Let 's change names instead , " Indy said . " You cope and I 'll wait . " Some breeze of merriment and liveliness stirred in her ; she felt suddenlythoroughly awake and expectant . " Where are you going , Mrs. Cope ? " " To the Tract , Mr. Waite , " Indy said . " The Tract ? " Waite asked . " Where 's that ? " " It 's a new development , " Indy told him , " about twenty-five miles southeast of here . The Pacific Electric will take me the first fifteen miles . Can you take me and my things to the depot ? " " That 'll be easy , " Waite said . " It 's not far from here . " Her luggage filled the back of his battered car , and he apologizedp142both for placing her in the front seat and for the condition of the car . " I about live in it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depot , which she would not have known anything about , except that he told her . " I do n't know Los Angeles as well yet as I ought to , " he explained . " Are you a newcomer ? " Indy asked . " We 've been in California three months . " Indy wondered about the " we , " but said nothing , trying to make up by present restraint for her earlier openness . It was late afternoon , and light fell down upon them from a cloudless sky like pellucid drops from some towering and hidden waterfall . After the green gloom of the East , Indy was newly aware of light and understood as never before the pioneer 's joy in a clearing . " California is the clearing of the nation , " she burst out , forgetful of her resolution to be Lute 's ideal woman , silent with strangers . Waite did not understand her and said so . " Clearinghouse ? " he asked . " No . The open space . Open to the sun . Clear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded but did not reply . When he pulled up in front of the depot , he turned to her . " Is someone meeting you in Whittier ? " he asked . " No , " Indy said , and explained , since it hurt her vanity for him to think that no one cared whether she came or went , that her arrival was to be a surprise . " How 're you planning to get from Whittier to the place you live ? " " I 'll have to hire a car , I suppose . " Waite was silent for a second or two , then he said , " I 'll drive you to the Tract for whatever your fare on the Pacific Electric would be plus the hire of a car from Whittier . " When Indy did not answer , he said , " I do n't think you 're going to be able to take all this stuff on a streetcar anyway . Why do n't I go in , ask about the fare to Whittier , the charges for carrying baggage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stand . " Lidy had dreaded the inquiring and negotiating that lay ahead of her . If she hired Waite , all that would be taken care of . He stood on the sidewalk , his peak-brimmed cap on the back of his head , awaiting her decision . He looked tired and underfed to Indy , and as if he needed the job . And if he charged her only the Pacific Electric fare to Whittier plus what she would have to pay to get to the Tract , she would not be out any more than if she chose the more difficult trip by streetcar . It was necessary for her to sum up all these advantages to herself and addp143to them the additional fact that she would undoubtedly be helping a deserving young man before she could say yes . Otherwise , she might have to believe that she was hiring a driver because he was attractive and she liked to talk to him . " If the charges are the same , I 'll be glad to have you drive me . " The young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you know the cost both ways down to the last nickel . " Waite 's forthright talk about money pleased her . Lute would never speak of money . It was one of the subjects he did not consider nice . He would overpay rather than ask any questions about a bill . He would never inquire beforehand about prices . He insisted , when they dined out with others , on always being the one who treated . When Indy protested , Lute 's face would harden . " Let 's not talk about it , " he 'd say . And to make sure they would n't , he would walk off and leave her . When Waite came back , he said , " You should never have let me go in there . I 'm going to have to charge you two dollars more . It would cost you that much to send your trunk out by freight  --  and you would n't get it until two or three days , either . I hope you do n't think I 'm talking too much about money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . " " No , no , " Indy told him . " I do n't think you 're talking too much about money . " She thought she could talk money all afternoon with Mr. Waite . The very word " money " struck her as both daring and flattering . And intimate . She felt like a girl who has heard the word " sex " used in public for the first time . A fresh , heady breeze of reality swept across her . Waite respected her common sense , that was the flattering part ; and he spoke to her of matters usually hidden , that was the daring part . She was exhilarated . This was no cat-and-mouse conversation on a subject neither cared about . " Money decides our life , " she declared earnestly . " If people wo n't talk about it , I do n't know what they will talk about . Money is im-portant . " " It 's sure important to me , " Mr. Waite agreed in a flat voice , which , nevertheless , conveyed some surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away in her speech with a stranger than was seemly . She kept quiet until they were out toward the end of Seventh Street , where the city smells gave way to the smell of the summer-dried crops of wild mustard and volunteer oats that grew on the vacant lots . Then , still excited by that word " money , " she burst out , " Butp144would n't you have made more money staying in town and getting a lot of passengers ? " " I might not 've got a lot of passengers . Besides , you 're going to the Tract . " " The Tract ? " Indy felt suspicious . " I thought you said you did n't know where the Tract was ? " " I did n't . But it 's in the right direction . " " The right direction for what ? " Indy asked . Mr. Waite turned to her and smiled . " The right direction to get to Banning . " " Is that where you live ? " Indy asked . " No . But my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of Mr. Waite was changing . What was he , a kind of grass widower , gallivanting around picking up strange women ? " My wife 's in Banning for her health , " Mr. Waite said . " I 'm sorry , " Indy said . " Sorry for my wife , or for the things you 've been thinking ? " " Both , " Indy admitted in a low voice . She wanted to tell the truth but she was not often permitted to . " You like things pretty cut and dried , do n't you ? " Mr. Waite asked . " You do n't care for any surprises . " " That 's not what I 've always thought about myself . " " You do n't like surprises in yourself either , do you ? " Indy changed the subject . She had not the courage for such intimacy . It meant too much to her . She took it as another woman might have taken a kiss . But she had not the strength of character to leave it alone either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They , she and Waite , were still the subject , but she shifted the emphasisto him . " Where is Banning , exactly ? " " It 's about seventy-five miles southeast of here , on the edge of the desert . The dry air there has done wonders for other people with lung trouble . I sure hope it helps Rosalie . " " Rosalie ? " Indy said , drawn back to herself in spite of her resolution . " My name 's Rose . Though I 'm not called that . " " You look something like my wife . That 's how I first came to notice you . You look like she did when she was younger . " " Younger ? I must be a lot older than your wife . " " Rosalie 's thirty . Two years younger than me . But consumptionp145ages a person . It wears you down . You 've got to live old , with it , whether you are or not . " " It must be terrible for both of you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and for me . And for the kids , too . " " Kids ? " Indy asked . " Two boys . We left them back in Nebraska with their grandmother . " " Why do n't you live in Banning ? " " No work . Too many fellows there like me , willing to do anything . " " Your wife must look forward to your visits . " " She does . And when I get there she ca n't talk . " " Ca n't talk ? " " She can whisper a little . But she ought n't to do that . The disease has settled in her throat , and talking keeps her throat from healing . I tell her things . But it 's hard to talk when there is n't any answer . " " Yes , " Indy said , " it is . " " There 's no blame to her , God knows . But that 's probably why I 'm running on to you . You can talk back . " They had to stop in Whittier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and for the fact that he had to get an advance from Indy to pay for the gas . " I 've been kind of living from hand to mouth lately , " he said . Indy , who had had to get out of the car while gas was put in , walked about admiring the garage owner 's flowers . Across the street , she noticedan eating place called " The Kitchen Cafe . " The building was half hidden under drooping pepper boughs and had waist-high geraniumscovering the weathered , unpainted boards , which were met , a little above the geraniums , by screen . The food smelled good , and when Mr. Waite had settled for the gas , she asked him to have supper with her . She felt nervous and daring about issuing such an invitation , but his " living from hand to mouth " had decided her . " If you 're not in too much of a hurry , would you mind stopping to have supper here ? " she asked . " I 'm not in too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waite said . " I 've got more than enough money for both of us . " Waite hesitated , then said , " You 're the judge of that , I guess . All I 'm required to judge is whether or not I 'm hungry . And I am . " The Kitchen Cafe , the minute she stepped inside , pleased Indy . The floor , splintery and unpainted , was well scrubbed . There were ten tables covered with flowered oilcloth . The napkins were in the water glasses , and the cutlery was covered by upturned plates . On each tablep146a round , hard-packed bouquet of oleanders , geraniums , and nasturtiumsblazed like a small sun . Pepper boughs dragged their lacy fronds across the roof with the sound of wind . The hard little pepper berries pattered on the dry shingles in cool rainlike flurries . A Mexican boy was irrigating the lemon grove behind the cafe . He mended the ditches with light clean strokes of his hoe , keeping time to the tune he whistled . Doves , suppering on the pepper berries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm trees , mockingbirds sang their own songs , though with an undercurrent of the sound of the doves which they could not resist imitating . The food was cooked by a large Mexican woman and served by a small white man , perhaps her husband . They had no choice about the food , which was a pot roast cooked in some spicy Mexican way , but it was good , and Indy found that after train sandwiches , she , too , was hungry . Except for a family with small children , eating at the other end of the cafe , they were alone . The waiter , when he had tended to his customers , sat in the kitchen talking to the cook . Perhaps she was not his wife . She laughed a lot at what he said . " They sound nice , do n't they ? " Indy asked . " Yes , they do . I like to hear a woman laugh . " He spoke sadly , Indy thought . She supposed he was thinking of Rosalie , who could no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I do , too . But she ca n't , so I 'll have to enjoy it for both of us . And I do . I do n't usually have such luck . Good meal , no expense , somebodybeautiful to talk to mc . " " Mr. Waite , " Indy said immediately and reprovingly . " What 's the matter ? " Mr. Waite asked . She did not know how to answer that question and was sorry she had spoken . There was nothing wrong with it . She wished she could speak as openly as Mr. Waite , could say , Mr. Waite , there is something about your face that makes me very happy . I do n't know whether or not it is beauty , but it makes me want to talk to you honestly . When she did not answer his question , Mr. Waite said , " You 're a full-grown woman , a married woman , I see by your rings , though for some reason you have n't told me so . Why beat around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad I think you 're beautiful . " Indy was , but the old habits held . " We do n't have to say everything we think . "  | " Not if we 've got ugly thoughts . Or if they wo n't do any good . That was n't an ugly thought . " " Will you tell your wife you told a woman she was good-looking ? " " Beautiful , " Mr. Waite said . " No , I wo n't . Rosalie 's prettiness is gone now . And there 's no point hurting her bringing back reports of something she 's lost . I 'd no more tell her that than I 'd tell her I met a mighty healthy woman . But I hope some stranger in the days when Rosalie was well and pretty told her so . I was too busy grubbing away in those days to say it . I sure hope some stranger said it for me . I hope she can remember that . Why not ? We 're men and women . We look at each other . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see something good , why not say so ? " " I do n't know why , " Indy answered . " Well , I know why , " young Mr. Waite said , " and I 'll tell you . We 're so damned starved for some honesty and some hint somebody 's really looked at us and seen us and sized us up that when we do hear a word like that we get dizzy . We 're so starved for it , it hits us like alcohol . It goes to our heads . Or to places less mentionable . We think someone wants to make love to us . Nothing so terrible about that either , though it 's not always the case . " " Who are you ? " Indy half whispered . " You mean , what do I do , do n't you ? That 's how you judge people , is n't it ? " " Yes , " Indy said . " That 's what I mean , I suppose . " " I 've been a dozen things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a taxi driver . Does that answer your question ? " " I do n't know . I 'm not sure what my question is . " " You need n't act so shocked about my saying you were beautiful . You told me you liked my looks when you let me take care of your luggage instead of getting some redcap . " " What I thought about your looks , " Indy said , " was that you were a poor , tired , hungry young man . " " Well , you must like the looks of poor , tired , hungry young men , then . " Up to this moment , Indy had truly not looked at Mr. Waite 's face beyond the youthfulness , which had proved false , beyond the hunger , which had vanished , beyond the tiredness , which was no longer visible . Now she looked , and time , in the moment of observing , fell away from him , and she saw across the table from her a man of her own age , ap148human being of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . Time , falling also away from her , made the moment timeless  --  and true  --  and she faced , across the packed bouquet of blazing flowers , not only a man 's face , but an enduring symbol , bronze or marble , out of the past and somehow out of the future , too . " Talk to me , " he said . " If we spend thirty more minutes here and it takes thirty to get to the Tract , that 's only an hour . Let 's not waste it . There 's no sense in wasting it , is there ? " " No , " Indy said . But she remained silent . The pepper boughs and pepper berries continued to simulate the sound of wind and rain . The Mexican boy had put up his hoe and was watering the garden flowers . The air was sweet with the rich scents of a summer night 's blooming : phlox and petunias , roses and Nicotiana . " Do n't you think and feel ? " Mr. Waite asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to be vain , " I do n't know about think . " " Talk to me , " he said again . " Do n't you believe in saying what you feel ? Are you out of the habit of speech ? Or do n't you believe in it ? " " I believe in it . And am out of the habit . " " You 've got to start sometime . I 've told you about Rosalie . Now you tell me about someone you love . " " I 'll tell you about Press , " Indy said . " I 'll tell you about my **25;1727;TOOLONG . " They sat at the table later than they had intended . Day was long finished when they went outside . A great star the size of a lantern , luminous with the watery splashed yellow of lantern light reflected from a wet road , hung low in the west . In the east , there was the white light of a moon not yet risen . On the way to the Tract they talked less . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers behind them . The dry , tangy air of the barley-stubble fields , of baked earth and sun-dried grasses flowed across them . The bleached moon was ahead of them now , leadinglike a polestar . Indy spoke less because she was shaken by the experience of speaking at all , and anguished by the knowledge that in a few more minutes she could speak no more . If only each day for half an hour I might talk to him , no matter what else happened , I would be happy , she thought . I would n't care how many other people would be in the same room , or whether or not they listened . Whatever happened to me , sickness or poverty , would n't be important , because we wouldp149talk about their meanings . And it 's the meanings that are important . She felt a desire to tell Waite how much she had liked his talk , how wise and good she believed him to be to reveal himself to her as he had . She wanted to match his forthrightness and honesty in telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling him her opinion of his talk . She could n't tell him all  --  if she did so , he would think she was crazy . She could remember only one other time when she had been filled with such joy : that was the night of her conversion at the age of twelve , at the Sand Creek Baptist Church . This evening she felt as if she had been converted again . Converted to what , she did n't know . To the life men and women can lead when they speak to each other truly ? Was this Mr. Waite 's message of redemption ? " I wish I could talk to you every day , " Indy said , speaking with effort . " I feel as if I 'd climbed a mountain and had seen something beautifulI 'd never seen before . Or only once before . I 'll think of you and Rosalie often . I want to live the way we 've talked . I thank you for it . You are a beautiful talker . " Mr. Waite laughed . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're quite a pair . " " Talk is very important , " Indy said . " Talk is the soul . " " Talk is more than that . It 's the whole man , " Waite said . " If there is a whole man . " Indy understood what this meant . When you liked the talk , you liked the man . She had come far enough in three hours to understand that this might be so , but she was not ready to accept it . She wanted to go on separating the two . She wanted to be able to dislike and disagreewith the words , and love the man . She wanted to be able to reverethe words , be shaken by the words , have the heart sucked out of her chest and the blood out of her veins by the words , and say a calm good-by to the speaker . She was able to do so . She got out of the car , paid Mr. Waite , thanked him , and asked him to stack her luggage in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she said . " He 's a newspaperman and goes to all public meetings . " " I 'll go in and see , " Waite said . " I wo n't drive off and leave you here in this godforsaken place alone . You wait here , Rose , till I get back . " It was the first time he had used her name . " You called me Rose , ' " she said . " You have any objections ? " " No. "  | " You never asked me what my name was , even ! " " I thought about doing it . " " I know you did . Why did n't you ? " " I thought it would be pretty personal . " " Yes , it would have been , " Waite agreed . " It really would have been . " He pushed his cap to the back of his head , smiled , and said , " So long , Rose . I 'll find your husband for you . " Indy stood still until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him inside , calling , " Lute , Lute ! " Indy and Lute met about midway to the door . There was n't any question of Sylvester Perkins discussing water while that meeting took place . Lute 's lone state , permanent or temporary , had been discussed by all , and since Lute had never made any bones about being lonesome , this was like a play with a happy ending . If Perkins at that minute had said , " There 'll be water in all standpipes tomorrow at seven a.m. , " no one would have heard him . Love meant more to them than war  --  or water . Perkins 's son , dying , for all they knew , on the Western Front , had not diverted their attention , but a woman in a man 's arms made them forget their irrigationproblems . We 're lovers before we 're killers , Asa thought ; but he knew it was n't a fair test . The dying had been nothing but words and statistics . The loving was going on right there before their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried away , even by his own wife , in full public view . It was apparent that he was saying , " Let 's go . Let 's get out of here . " But his wife would have none of that . She would not hear to taking him away from his duty and his meeting . So this time Press was the one who got up to provide another seat . Shel watched Press slide past Torn Mount and into the aisle . He could not tell by her expression whether happiness was what she felt at her mother 's return or not . But she felt something intensely . She did not kiss her mother , but grabbed her hand , pressed it to her cheek in a theatrical way , then turned toward the back of the tent . When Lute seated his wife between himself and Tom Mount , Shel took a closer look . Indiana Rose Cope was no raving beauty ; she was no one you could size up that fast . But she had a troublesome face , one that kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't want to turn away from it until you 'd found the answer . It was no simple ques/i ion like " Will you go to bed with me ? " which any man of the right age could answer . It was a question for which maybe you alone in the entire world had the proper answer . Turning away from her , with her question left unanswered , gave you a guilty feeling . And the feeling of guilt made you resolve to try to make it up to her some way in the future . The arrival of Lute Cope 's wife lost Shel what hope he 'd had of Lute 's leadership . It was perfectly evident that , with her by his side , Lute did n't care whether he ever again had as much as a swallow of water , let alone the legal amount of miners ' inches . And she had lost all of them their concentration ; they were not as prepared as they had been to bear down on Perkins , wring , if not water , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins of more than it robbed anyone else . She had stolen his thunder . Perkins paused ; he let them wait again , but they would not hang on his words twice . " I am going to skip Shel Lewis 's first question , " he said , " and turn my attention to the second . In answer to it , it gives me pleasure to tell you this . I 'll have water in all standpipes on the morn-i ng of November 17 , 1916 . " If he had expected cheers and hand clappings , he did not get them . He got silence , an accusing silence . Why had he put them all in the wrong , with the news about his son , making them think he was trying to pull the wool over their eyes ? And now he was taking the wind out of their sails , making a gift of what they had been prepared to fight for . Shel Lewis got to his feet . " Mr. Perkins , your promises have n't all held water in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've all gambled coming here , buying unimproved land . A little more do n't make a hell of a lot of difference . But I want you to know one man believesyou and is gambling on your word . I 'm going ahead setting out my trees . I 'm not going to dibble along , bucket at a time . So far , you do n't have anything to answer for but our hardships . Our time 's wasted , our kids go dirty , our wives have got short tempers . I grant you these things are no life-and-death matter . Our kids have been dirty before , we 've wasted our time before , our wives have been mad at us before . But you make another mistake  --  you misfigure dates again  --  and you 've got something more to answer for . " Nobody clapped for Shel either . He sat down feeling that he had been crazy to risk , for some damn-fool reason not clear to himself , hisp152whole future on this man 's word . But he was tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be sudden instead of inchmeal . He expected Sylvester Perkins to make some reply . Sylvester Perkins nodded , as if fully accepting this responsibility , then he , too , sat down. people sat around the center table in the Jessups ' sitting room . Two others , Mary Jessup and Asa Brice , who was helpingMary hand around the ginger drops ( held back from the meeting for just such an eventuality ) , stood in the doorway to the kitchen , looking to see if anyone 's cup needed refilling . It had been the most natural thing in the world for Mary to ask a few people home with them after the meeting . The two ladies , Opal and Eunice , had felt obliged to refuse ; but Reverend Raunce and his family , the Lewises , and Ben 's friend Asa Brice had snapped up her invitation before it was fairly out of her mouth . The Jessups ' sitting room had been imported , down to the last peacockfeather in a vase on the secretary , direct from Emporia , Kansas . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lute Cope  --  and his stuff came only from Northern California , not from back East  --  had anything like it . Against the plain pine walls , the furniture looked a little as if it were camping out ; but there was not a person in the room who did not feel enhanced by the red plush sofa , the secretary full of books , the center table lighted by a hanging lamp , the piano spread with hymn books . Everybody had worked hard all day , had had his feelings wrought up by Perkins 's oratory , and was now prepared to smile and luxuriate in the presence of something which promised that life finally rewarded hard work with a little ease . Mary Jessup had spent thirty years choosing , helping to buy , and arranging the objects that gave her guests so much pleasure . The room was her handiwork , in some ways her life ; to have it used , because it was herself , was like being a mother to babies all over again . Men , she thought , never have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . Oh , a man with a farm or a factory sees it used , she supposed , but not by lamplight , not by people he loves . And love , to tell the truth , was what she was feeling for everyone in the room : for thep153women whose hands smoothed the plush sofa ; for the men who , chewingginger drops , caught her eye , and gave their heads quick little turns of satisfaction to show her that her cooking had hit the spot . At the moment , love was what she felt even for old Wendlin , for whom ordinarily she entertained only the dearest affection , admiration , and tolerance . She did not fool herself into thinking that this momentwas going to last forever : that the knuckle-headed Raunce , his nonentity of a wife and their snip of a daughter would n't get on her nerves again someday ; but at the minute , there was n't a foot in the room she would n't wash , and , washing finished , dry with her hair . Lovableness was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience everything at once . iThe four men , Raunce , Wendlin , Ben Jessup , and Shel Lewis , held the center of the room ; their talk rolled out from them and lapped around their wives and children . Chad Lewis , who might have been counted a man , paid no attention to this talk . He sat bemused , as if he had suffered a sunstroke and was just coming to . His father shot him a glance now and then to sec if the boy was behaving all right . He was . The Raunce girl sat beside him , and he answered all her questions and even , now and then , put in his own oar . Usually , he tossed his head like a horse fighting the bit ; tonight , he not only kept his head still , but had possibly run a comb through his hair as well . When Crystal said , " What are your plans for the future ? " Chad feltlike telling her , " My plan is to marry Press Cope . " He knew this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in love . Love was a part of him , like the blood in his veins . But marriage was an act ; it was something that had to be planned for and accomplished , like barnrailingsand cornhuskings . Feeling by itself , he knew well enough , would n't get him anywhere when it came to a practical affair like a wedding . And he was going to wed that girl . Oh , nothing else , none of that woods-colting around that had sullied his father . He was silent for so long , so busy with the practical details of arranging his marriage , that Crystal gave him up and listened , in spite of herself , to her father . She preferred not to hear him ; she waited apprehensivelyfor him to say something ridiculous . But at the minute he was as sensible as could be , nothing but citrus fruit , water , and the Perkins Investment Company . You would n't know God existed ( praise God ) , to hear him talking now . " Why 'd you want to get yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked  | " To tell the truth , I do n't know , " Shel Lewis answered . " Except I wanted to pin Perkins down . He might worry more about ruining one man  --  when everybody knew he was doing it  --  than he would about stringing us all along and ruining us all , finally . " The minute he said that , Shel was sorry . It sounded like he was ready to die for the good of others , and when Wendlin said , " Shel , you do n't look to me like a man cut out to be a scapegoat , " Shel had a chance to set them all right . " I 'm not , Wendlin , and I do n't aim to be one either . First of all , I got carried away because I was sore at Perkins . Then I figured that he 's going to have the water ready when he said he was . I do n't mind a gamble  --  if I think the chances are I 'll win . But the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprung on us to make us think we 're nothing but mean little scrabblers , while bighearted Perkins is living and dyingwith the soldiers . " " Say , Wendlin , " Raunce asked , " what would you 've done if Perkins 'd turned the meeting into one big hurrah for us to get into the war ? " " Why , same as you , LeRoy . Got down off that platform . " " LeRoy would n't have to get down , " Ben Jessup said . " He could stay up there and recruit for war . LeRoy ca n't sin . Can you , LeRoy ? " Even though the discussion , with her as well as Ben and Wendlin talking , would turn into a Jessup round robin , Mary Jessup spoke up from the doorway . It was n't that she objected to sin as a subject of conversation . What else , except goodness , was there in the world ? It was n't that she was overly tender toward Raunce . But Ben was no preacher yet , and she hated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so early . " Ben , " she called out , " LeRoy 's sinning 's his own private affair . " LeRoy himself contradicted her . " No , it 's not , Mrs. Jessup . A man ca n't sin to himself . No man and especially no preacher . If I sin , it 's Ben 's affair and I 'll thank him never to forget it . " " If you start forging checks . . . " Mary began her hypothetical case , but LeRoy interrupted her . " It 'd be too late then , Mrs. Jessup . Besides , Ben 's right . I ca n't sin . " LeRoy did not announce this boastfully or sorrowfully ; he did not seem proud of it or worried about it . He said it the same way another man would say , " I ca n't play the piano . " But it shut down the conversation in the room . It was no new doctrine to the Jessups or to Asap155Iirice ; but to the Lewises it was about on a par with hearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " I 've got a couple of little wings under my coat " ; except that such declarations did not have to be proved minute by minute , the way LeRoy 's would have to be proved . When Shel got over his shock , he said , " LeRoy , is that what they 're learning you over at Rose Park ? " " They believe it over there , but it 's nothing a man could be learned . It 's no credit to me . I 'm not boasting about my own goodness . If you 're born again , you 're dead to sin . Once it 's happened to you , you ca n't misdoubt it . " He was as open-faced about his state as a boy with the mumps . He made sinlessness sound like cross-eyes or big Adam 's apples ; nothing you could boast about , but nothing to contradict either. " joined to Christ , where 's the room for sin ? " Raunce sounded to Chad as if he was talking about marriage . To Crystal , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the simple truth to Dolly Raunce . She had a sinless husband . Shel Lewis gloried in the novelty . He had never heard the like . by God , the world turned up something fresh every day . Old Wendlin thought , History repeats itself . LeRoy and Rose Park had worked their way back to where Quakerism started . " Fox would subscribe to that , LeRoy , " he said . " George Fox ? " asked LeRoy . He was learning about Fox over at the Park , but what Fox thought about sin was a mystery to him . And what Fox thought did n't matter . LeRoy was n't living out of any book , not even the Bible . The Bible writers got their inspiration from the same place he got his . " You and Fox , maybe , " Ben said . " But not me . I can sin . " " That 's your opinion , " Raunce told him . Ben was startled but admitted it . " But I do n't know who 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can and maybe you ca n't , " Raunce said . " Maybe you 've lost the power . " Ben gave a start , like a man suddenly told he 's lost his manhood ; he looked around the room wondering if such a thing could happen and a man be unaware . " It 's your pride , boy , " LeRoy told him . " I 've struck at your pride . You do n't want to give God the credit . You want to take credit for cvery little victory yourself . You do n't hone after your neighbor 's wife . Or mine , " LeRoy said , giving his Dolly , who sat beside him , a big hugp156and kiss , and almost forgetting , in the pleasure of that act , to carry on his argument . " So you want to think that you deserve the credit . You do n't look on your neighbor 's wife to lust after her . Why , Ben , you could n't . " Ben contemplated giving some proof of his ability to sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brother Raunce . But though his fist clenched , his arm did not rise up to deliver the blow ; and he did n't know any other way to refute Raunce . He certainly , with Ellen Lewis sitting there looking up at him dewy as apple blossoms , was n't going to refute Raunce by saying he was as lustful as the next man and that he owed his restraint to cold baths and cross-country running . Sometimeshe doubted that he had ever received a true call to the ministry ; and the ironic part of his doubt was that no one was surer to plant this doubt in his mind than another minister . He himself , as a person incapableof sin , was incredible ; but what worried him about this convictionwas that a world in which sin was n't possible seemed to him lackluster , tepid . Where was the triumph in a world like that ? But was Raunce right ? Did he want goodness , not as a gift from God , but as a sign of his own strength ? Raunce , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily as he had Dolly . " You do n't think this young fellow 's any sinner , do you , honey ? " The word " sin " abashed Ellen . They did n't talk about sin at home . People did things that were wrong , and she did herself , but she did n't say to her mother and father afterward , " I have sinned . " She wanted to be polite to the Reverend Raunce but she also wanted to change the subject , to get away from talking about sin . " How do you drill for oil , Reverend Raunce ? " She spoke , in her embarrassment , with the intensity of a wildcatter heading at once for the fields . Everyone laughed ; they were through with sin for that evening . Mary Jessup started to make the rounds with her coffeepot , but Asa took it from her . " Mary , you have n't had a bite yet yourself . You sit down and eat and let me take care of the company . " " Coffee 's turned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies ? " " Cookies , too . " " Well , what can you eat ? Let me get it for you . " " I never was much of a piecer between meals , Asa . I 'm not hungry . "  |p157Asa  looked his friend in the face ; he tried to see if there were signs of a sickness she was n't admitting there . She knew what he was doing . She returned his look with a knowledgeable and accusing smile . " There 's nothing wrong with me a little baking soda wo n't cure . Do n't you ever get heartburn , Asa ? " " Heartburn ? Why , Mary , I 'm slowly dying of it , " he said . Lizzie Cudlip had been as fully prepared as Mary Jessup to ask some of their new neighbors home for refreshments after the meeting ; more fully prepared , if elaborateness of food counts . When she and Basil lit the lamps , there on the dining-room table were the hand-painted plates , the cupcakes iced with coconut , the big glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished . The sight made her momentarily sad . It reminded her of the frequency with which her hopes of hospitality were disappointed . Basil 's , too , for that matter . He was as anxious as she to give parties and to go to them , to be neighborly , to set a good table and to share the goodness with others . They wanted to do that , but they did n't want to do it at the cost of backing down about what was right . First of all , they must take a stand , and after that , if no one wanted to visit with them , well , that was the sacrifice they would have to make for their convictions . A room prepared for a party , and partyless , Lizzie thought , is like a tree in spring that fails to leaf ; though she knew that her house was sad only because of the absence of what she had imagined . In itself , with no party in her mind , the house would appear cheerful , clean , and orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had found in an unexpectedly damp spot at the bottom of an arroyo . Sylvester Perkins had had something other than this house in mind when he had told Louella that the Cudlips would bring a little tone to the Tract . Syl , always optimistic about the Tract , had convinced himself that the Cudlips would establish an outpost of the Old South on their twenty acres . Syl 's ideas about the Old South were sketchy . I Ie had seen a movie called " The Clansman " and read the second half of a Civil War story called " Cease Firing , " and he had in his possession a ring carved from a bone button by a great-uncle while imprisoned at Andersonville . The great-uncle had died at Andersonville , and that button should , in all logic , have done nothing to make Syl sentimentalabout the Old South . But All Logic is a realm as fanciful as the Old South , and Syl had never even seen a movie about it.  |p158The  Old South meant to Syl white columns , fanlights , bluegrass meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver candlesticks , and mahogany drop-leaf tables laden with mint juleps , beaten biscuit , and Southern fried chicken . There was n't a single item of Syl 's imagining inside or outside the Cudlip house . Nevertheless , the place did have a certain tone . This tone was wholly the result of an effect in furnishing and arrangement achieved by Lizzie as the result of the impression made on her mind by Basil 's accounts of his grandfather 's home . Such was the tenacity of Basil 's memory and the strength of Lizzie 's love for him that with no help , except poverty , she had been able to give to her home a certain perpendicular elegance and patrician spareness . The image of his grandfather 's home in Tennessee was as fresh in Basil 's mind as anything on the Tract . In and about it had been everythingSylvester Perkins imagined , when Basil spoke to him of the South . And no wonder . Without once mentioning bluegrass or beaten biscuits , Base , as he spoke , saw his grandfather 's home with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and have lost unfairly , All of it would , except for his father 's lack of rectitude , have been his , Chairs , carpets , clocks that he would never have noticed if he owned them were pictured for him by his deprivationdown to the last rung , extreme fringe , and final numeral . His mind clotted around them ; they were obstructions preventing the free flow of his blood . He would awaken in the night and see some globed lamp hung about with teardrop pendants , long since , no doubt , so shattered as to have vanished completely ; and he would long for it with the unquenchable bitterness and desire men have for loved women who have been unfaithful ; though those noble acres and graciousbuildings had never been unfaithful . They lived in his mind as more than themselves , as symbols of the rectitude that had built and adorned them ; and as symbols , too , of the looseness that had lost them . Since he did not have the objects stolen from him by a lack of rectitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : rectitude , aggressive , unyielding , fighting rectitude . That much of his grandfather 's life he could have . His grandfather would have done what he did tonight  --  and every person at the meetingwould have followed his grandfather from the tent , though in his grandfather 's day there would have been no occasion for the protest he had had to make . Lizzie put the food on the center table in the sitting room , and thep159two of them sat down and ate as formally as though guests were present . Whatever else Basil was , he was n't two-faced . He did not care about appearances , only about what was right . He had no dainty mannerwhich he put on in public but dropped with his family . He was , in fact , often more surly and contentious in public than at home . If Lizzie had a fault as a wife , it lay in her adoration of Basil . Nothingshe did or said asked him to be other than he was . There was noth-i ng slavish or calculated in Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , Basil was the man she had always imagined marrying . And having been honestly and naturally brought up , she had not imaginedsomeone against her own nature . Most women either imagine against their natures and marry men who fit their false imaginings , only to find such men disappointing , if not unendurable ; or , imagining truly but failing to encounter the imagined man , they marry whom they can . In either case , there is heartsickness ( often well hidden ) at the discrepancy . These wives wake up each morning with a little knot of sorrow at the base of their throats . But not Lizzie . She awakened happy , knew she was lucky , and thanked God for her luck . She never wondered whether or not it was lucky for Basil to have a wife so incapable of imagining a better man than Basil . Lizzie , as a poor girl living first in one rented house and then another , with a father who was shiftless and put-upon , especially by his wife , had always dreamed of a strong man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commanding , righteous . Basil was all of this  --  and more . The more was that he was continuously able to keep her imagination alive by his life of action in the world outside their home . In that world , she did not live ; there , to follow him , she had to keep him in mind . He had a life she had to imagine , and because she did so , Basil was never to her the unwanted interruption some women find their husbands . He was the comforting materialization of what had been tantalizing her imagination . He came home to a woman prepared for him by her dreams . And she never dreamed of wanting him any different . Only Medora in the Cudlip family did this . Her parents , partaking decorously of the refreshments they had planned for the evening , were waiting up for her . Basil had left the meeting in too much anger , shame , and disappointment ( for his fellow citizens ) to notice that one of his five was missing . Lizzie , who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was leaving her behind and had his reasons for doing so . They were halfway home before it came to Basil that Medorap160was not with them . He pulled up his team , sat silent for a while , then clucked up the horses and headed on toward home . The walk home , a couple of miles , was nothing ; but Lizzie had been surprised that Basil did not drive back to the meeting to get Medora . Time was when he would have done so ; not only because he did not want Medora out alone , but to protect her from the debasing mingling of white and colored . When they had finished eating , Basil said , " You go on to bed , Lizzie . I 'll wait up for Medora . " Lizzie was glad to go . She had been up since four , cleaning and cooking  --  butshe believed also that Basil was the one who should talk to Medora . She herself was no match for the girl . It was fifteen after eleven when Medora came into the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but had made it earlier because she had accepted a ride with the Ramos family and their friend Julian . She had accepted the ride with misgivings , but out of principle . She believed that all men were created equal , but it had taken some courage to put the matter to a test after dark and with strangers . Equal ! She , who usually felt her powers to be far beyond any call made upon them by persons or circumstances , had felt lumpishand tongue-tied with the Mexicans ; but she had enjoyed the three pleasant-mannered , gay , exaggerating , flattering young people . She came into the house so full of her discovery and happiness that she had forgotten her father and his certain anger  --  as he had forgotten her . He was in the rocking chair by the center table in the sitting room , lamp turned up and light full on his sleeping face . His head was neither tilted against the back of the rocker nor was it resting on his chest . He slept in the position of a man awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face as she had never been able to do before . Sleep was a sign of desired privacy , like a pulled blind or a closed door . She gazed at her father like a keyhole peeker , and felt the peeker 's guilt and triumph . There was in her father 's strong , composed features a sadness never visible when he was awake . She was sorry to see it , because he was her enemy and she did not want to soften toward him . She did not hate him , she supposed , any more than the man in one trench hates the enemy he is shooting at in the other trench . Later , they might even be friends . But now , he stood in her way . She was still staring down at him when he opened his eyes . He had no need to rearrange his face , close his mouth , straighten his hair . Thep161same in private as in public , he was also the same sleeping as waking  --  except for that hint of sadness which he lost when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father that made fighting him a comfortablebusiness for Medora . He was always wrong , always strong , always attacking . " Sit down , Medora , " he said , not like an outraged father , but like a Southern gentleman . He never sat while ladies stood . When Medora had seated herself , Basil said , " Why did you stay at the meeting , Medora , after we left ? " " Because we 're going to live here and I want to know somebody . There were girls there my own age . " " Did you talk to those girls ? " " Yes , I did . " " Do you know why I left ? " " Of course I know why . " " You do n't have any respect for your father 's convictions ? " " I respect your convictions , all right . I do n't try to make you do something you think is wrong , the way you do me . " " Do n't you recognize any differences between parents and children ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to live by what 's over and done with . " " Right is right , " her father said . " Year in and year out . Right is never over and done with , I hope . " " Wrong 's wrong , year in and year out , too . " " Medora , " Basil said , " you know I ca n't whip you any more . Tell Inc , how can I teach you something without it ? " " You can whip me if you want to , " Medora said indifferently . She ran her left hand over the crook in her right elbow . " You know that was an accident , " Basil said . " It does n't make any difference one way or the other to me . " " You know I have no wish in this world except to make it a good place for my children to live . " Medora did n't answer . " You know that , do n't you ? " her father persisted . " I know it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " Her father said nothing . " May I go to bed now ? " Medora asked . Her father still did n't answer . After a long time , he got to his feet . " Medora , we 'll wait and see who 's right , and who 's wrong . You keep on headed the way you are , and in the end , you ask yourself if you do n't wish you 'd listened to me . Do n't think I 'm washing my handsp162of you . Do n't think for a minute I wo n't try to head you off from the trouble you 're bent on getting into . " He stood staring at her , and Mcdorareturned his gaze . " I 'm right , Medora , and you ca n't fight what 's right , " he said . " Do n't try to . There 've been others in our family did it and they went to their graves in sorrow . " He turned and went up the stairs without a good night . As she bent over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sitting room from an unusual perspective . Colorless and rigid , it seemed a part of a different world from that of which she had been a laughing part before she came into the house . Nabiscos were out again , the lamp lighted again ; in the kitchen , the kerosene stove was bubbling again , and the night wind blowing around the corners of the house smelled like nonexistent red roses . Press could smell them . Mother was home . The returned wife sat in a rocking chair , not rocking . Her husband faced her in a straight-backed chair , a Nabisco in his hand , not eating . Press , who had been watching them from the kitchen door , went outside . She wanted to include in her picture of her parents the house and the night . Under what kind of a sky , in what kind of weather , did her newly united parents meet ? Under a cloudless sky , under a yellow moon , under stars paled by moonlight . If her mother would only rock a little , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a high-necked white shirtwaist with rows of ruching and a new gold breastpin . It made her look like a visitor . Her father leaned toward her , smiling as if remembering a past happening , past but happy . The eye could n't see it , but something was missing ; something was held back ; somebody said " maybe , " " perhaps , " " I hope so , " but not " always . " It was surely not her father . Press had a sense more delicate than sight or hearing , which waited to be reassured . She had made it her religion to anticipate her mother 's wishes . It was a hard religion , since her mother did not always know her own wishes . The tea Press brought , her mother wanted ; but any further hanging around , as if at the sickbed of an invalid , she did not want . Press knew that . Hannah had gone to sleep on the way home from the meeting , and her mother had walked her straight into bed . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of a sentence . Now her mother waited for her to be gone ; but Press felt a need to make up to her mother , by some act of unusual devotion , her half hour of infidelity with the black-haired boy . Her mother knew nothing of the boy , would care less ; but for the time she had been with him , Press had forgotten the existence of her absent mother . So , not wanted , and knowing it , she still lingered on ; and in a minute , her mother would break through the held tenderness of the home-coming with some sharp word . Press was willing to be hurt . She owed her mother , at the very least , a little gift of suffering . She asked for it , to help even up the score . " Do you want some more tea ? " Her mother flared up , her voice breaking with impatience . " If we do , I can make it . " " Go to bed , Press , " her father said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two of them . It was where he should be , of course . She would n't respect him otherwise . When Press left the room , Lute clenched his Nabisco to crumbs , put the crumbs on the plate on the center table , and looked at his wife . " Indy , I 've lived for this hour . " She did n't doubt it . His happiness was in his face . She was home , resolved never to leave it again , and not deserving any welcome . Oh , not a man , no real reason for staying away so long , and her absence less excusable because of that . Lute 's words under these circumstances should have been music in her ears . Why were n't they ? What did she want to hear ? " I 've finished with you " ? " You 've gone off once too often " ? " I 've found me another woman " ? Or even " I 'm going to horsewhip you within an inch of your life " ? Imagining these answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such circumstances , she would outwit Lute , win him over , once again . She imagined desperate acts ; she imagined herself pushed to the end of her tether , struggling with all of her powers . This man , this handsome man , this man women liked , would be moved by her , find her irresistible . She would win him back in spite of his better judgment . As she lived for a minute through these trials and triumphs , her mouth relaxed and the blood warmed her face . " Indy , you look better every minute , " Lute said . She smiled at him , a made-up smile , but Lute could never tell the difference . He deserved a smile , and she knew how to make one . She made it , and he was delighted . This man who could edit newspapers ,  |p164write  pieces other papers copied , understand politicians , influence elections , make money , had a blind spot when it came to his wife . She , who could turn on a hundred moods , had them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as much as a man with muscles needs to flex them , found herself with a husband to whom they were all one because he loved her so much . She was Indy , and whatever she did was all right . He would accommodate himself to her and out of devotion refuse to differentiate . Where was her opponent ? How could she take her measure ? Who conquer ? No wonder she lashed out at Press once in a while , would give her , with tongue or hand , an unwarranted backhanded slap . But Press , too , robbed her of all victory . She was forced to be her own opponent , to fight herself ; to bring home again the Indy who ran away , captor and captive all in one ; a civil war won , where every victory was half defeat . She held the teacup in both hands , lowered her face to it so the steam touched her tired eyes . The action was familiar and homey to Lute , Indy with her eyes in her teacup . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home ; he should take the gladness , if she did not put it into words , for granted . Oh , how he trains me up to be a liar ! No woman not a fiend could bear to say anything but yes to such a question ; but true answers should well up , not have to be pumped . He should think that what he requires of me for his pleasure I may somedaylearn well enough to use for my own pleasure . Still , for all the practice , lying did not come easy . " Oh , Lute , " she said . Then she added , " I counted the days . " That was the truth . Once decided to return , she was impatient to have her body and her mind in the same place . When she was absent from Lute , she was always able to dream their future life together into any shape she chose . There was some break in her mind between the past and the future . She was never able to see that the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did the future she had dreamed become nothing more than an extension of the past from which she had run away . " Do you like the house , Indy ? " " Yes . " She did n't have to lie about that . " There 're going to be other improvements . Mount 's a carpenter . " " Lute , you 'll get him out of the house , wo n't you ? " Lute had some streak of sociability which , except for her , would keep the house filled with visitors.  | " He 'll leave tomorrow . I could n't very well put him out tonight after having asked him . " She set down her cup , stood and blew out the lamp . She went to Lute , abruptly , as a boy jumps into a pond of cold water . She leaned against him , and Lute , with a shuddering sigh , took her onto his lap . She was small enough to sit there comfortably , her head on his shoulder . Except for the continuous breathing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last man and woman on earth . She remembered the past , the unchanging past of their boyhood and girlhood . She began to speak of it . She wanted to lose herself in something . Lute loved this kind of remembering talk , and she herself found pleasure recalling those two young people about whom they knew so many facts but so little truth . " Why do you suppose we did that ? " they would ask each other , held by a mystery to which they had clues  --  but no complete answers . It was like trying to piece together a story , only a part of which they knew  --  and each knew different parts . They found a bedtime bewitchment in this storytelling . There was pain in it , sorrow and misunderstanding , but time and repetition had ennobledthe mishaps ; pain and sorrow were a part now of the story , and without them the story would have been as flat as Romeo and Juliet without the tombs . Though there was this difference : she and Lute altered as they went along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an understanding was added that afterwardbecame a part of their story  --  and of themselves . Indy drowsed deeper into Lute 's shoulder , knowing the game they were going to play and wondering who would start it . The beginning had to be delicate , something half remembered , about which they could both muse for a minute , something inconsequential and pleasant . Indy put her hand down to Lute 's feet . " Before I saw you , I saw your feet . I remember your shoes . You were crossing that little bridge in front of the dorm , and the oleander bushes hid your face . " " It was a footbridge , " Lute said . " Your shoes had cloth tops . " " I remember them . " Now they were in the past landscape , students at the one-horse college , where at sixteen and twenty they met and at seventeen and twenty-one married . " I saw you the first day you came to school , " Lute said . " You were two weeks late . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was  |p166looking  out of the window of the mathematics room . It was the first of October , about five-thirty , and no one else was in sight . You went right under the window , with that high-kneed walk of yours , like a horse on miry ground . You had on a hair ribbon . You got rid of that in a hurry . I never saw you with a ribbon on again . You had your head up , your eye on the horizon . You were seeing the future of I. R. Pressley . Then you looked up , saw me , knew you 'd been seen acting out your future , and you smiled . You smiled right into my eyes admitting everything . That was the end of me . " " The end ? " " Or the beginning . " " You were the first boy I ever went with . " " Why did you say yes when I phoned ? " " The girls said you were nice . " " Was I ? " " Yes . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We drove over a chuckhole , and you said , I saw that bump coming . ' I thought you really had . " " The first kiss ? Do you remember that ? " " Under the arbor in the rain . You were my first everything , Lute . I used to get so excited I 'd be sick after our dates . " " Be sick ? " " Come sick , I mean . " There was a pause . She had endangered the mood of their remembering . Lute did not like to speak of such things  --  or to hear her speak of them . " We never did anything but spoon . " " I know . " " I was brought up to respect girls . " " Your mother told me . " " Was it because of that night ? " " Maybe . " " You surprised me that night . I thought you 'd made a mistake about the bedrooms . " " How could I ? " " What else could I think ? You in my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I was n't mixed up . I thought , We 'll be married in ten days , and it 's crazy to wait . It 's not a race . We do n't have to wait until somebody fires a gun . "  | " You 're glad we did wait , though , are n't you ? " " Things like that do n't matter to women . I did n't know it then . " They were near a spot where the web of remembering might let them fall through into the present ; let them awaken to pain unennobledby being past . Indy went on quickly , practicing with Lute a bedtimetrick of her own when sleepless . " Do you remember our first house ? " " First shack . Three rooms . " " It faced the river and the mountains . " " I remember painting that living room white . " " The curtains were cream chintz with yellow-and-brown flowers . " " Were you the happiest you 've been . . . there ? " Careful , careful , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room gold-colored . " She pressed her face more closely into his shoulder . " When the wind came through the windows , the curtains lifted and fell as if the room was breathing . " He rocked her a little in his arms . " Are you sleepy ? " Oh , she was . She was half drowned in sleep . They had come a long way together , been boy and girl , husband and wife , father and mother . The hour was late , the room was deep in moonlight , the first of all their possessions still surrounded them , even the easily breakable lamp was a first ; and the center table on which it rested , and the chair on which they sat . Nothing was discarded , nothing mattered , the power of the first still held her ; and when Lute rose to carry her to bed , she went as unresisting as Hannah had . She did n't understand yet the need to go slow with water . She had gone to bed without washing and knew that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole train trip burned her face ; her fingers were dry as pieces of kindling wood . It must be near morning . There was still no morning light , but far off , roosters had begun their crowing . She got out of bed , stealthy as a thief , robbing Lute of her presence . He did not stir . The air had freshened ; it flowed under her nightgown like the beginnings of a bath . She got the dishpanfrom under the sink and went out to where Lute had showed her the barrels of water . She filled the dishpan and took off her nightgown . Mist marked the windings of the distant river ; the foothills were sharp and sad in the moonlight . This was her home : the Tract , empty , unplanted , no houses visible ; there were no sounds except forp168the katydids , remembering yesterday 's sun , and the roosters getting ready for today 's . As she washed , she shed tears . She made no effort to stop . She acceptedsorrow and loneliness as her lot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , how to make herself so busy building little balconies and having outdoor suppers and teaching Hannah to recite poetry that she 'd never have time to indulge them . Finally , she stood in the pan and rinsed herself with dippersful of water ; the air striking her wet body was cold enough to make her hold her breath , and holding her breath she stopped crying . Two men saw her as she stood in the dishpan pouring dippersful of water over her shoulders . Both , after the first sight of her , turned away . Tom Mount , hearing from his attic room the unaccountable splash of water , went to his window for a look . There beneath him , naked as a jay bird in the dishpan , was Indiana Rose Cope , wasting water by the bucketful . Her husband would give her a good talking-to tomorrow . She was a well-built woman , and if she had any lack , the moonlighthid it . But he was not particularly interested in women 's bodies . They were natural objects , sometimes pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect on a level with trees , horses , hydrangea bushes , and the like . What interested him in a woman was what he became with her . None of this being ascertainable , at this distance and at this hour , with Mrs. Cope , he went back to bed , hoping she 'd leave him enough water for tomorrow morning 's coffee . A.sa Brice , heading south toward the river for his usual dawn survey , also saw Mrs. Cope . Taking short cuts and ignoring the road , he came up over the rise on which the Cope house was built and saw her as she lifted a dipperful above her head . He stopped in his tracks . All beauty was holy , and this was beauty , pure and timeless as marble ; in this respect impersonal ; but beauty belonging also to a particular woman , and she should have the choice of revealing or hiding . He turned for this reason instantly away ; grateful as he would have been to see a falling star or hear a dove call ; deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a gift . He began to whistle so that she would believe , if she caught sight of him , that she had been unobserved . She did hear him , saw him go over the hill with his easy Indian stride , whistling softly . The night was ending . She emptied the dish/pan , put her nightgown back on , and re-entered the house . Calmly , without awakening him , she got back into bed with Lute . His body , after the cold water and the tears , was warm and comforting . She turned sidewise to fit her body to his , put an arm across him , and fell asleep . THE C L O C K began to strike as Opal and Eunice entered the house after the meeting . They stood still and counted eleven . They might have missed a note , but when Opal lit the lamp it was eleven all right . " It 's been quite a day , " she said . Eunice 's lips parted , but she said nothing . She seemed to be uncertainas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , go to bed or stay up , speak or be silent . She had taken special pains with her dressing , but in so far as Opal could judge , all her pains had come to nothing . Everything could be explained ; that was the trouble . What else , in the circumstances , Eunice had asked , could Tom have done ? Well , he could have grabbed Eunice , thrown his arms about her , announced their engagement , kissed her , pressed her hand , given her a note , asked to see her again soon , recalled old times , kept his eyes off other women . He had done none of these things . Yet , in these circumstances , Eunice could and did say , " He did what was sensible . He was protecting me as well as himself . " If Eunice had met Tom alone and he had been that undemonstrative , she would now know how things stood between them . As it is , Opal thought , she can keep on hoping ; believe that when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite to Indiana Rose Cope , or when he 's made a little more money , he can reveal his true feelings . " I 'm going to bed , " Opal told Eunice . " Seeing Tom Mount again , on top of hauling water and going to the meeting and being reminded of the , war , has worn me out . " The house had four rooms , a kitchen-dining room , a sitting room , and two bedrooms . In warm weather it was their custom to leave the two outside doors open . They had done this not so much for ventilationas to experience fully the freedom of the Tract , its openness and safety . It was a part of their new life to lie in their beds and hear andp170feel the night-long movement of the wind through the house and to smell the dry sweet scents of greasewood and elder and sagebrush . Now , without thinking , Opal closed the kitchen door . " Why did you do that ? " Eunice asked suspiciously . Opal did n't know why , until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of protection toward Eunice ; not of protection from Tom Mount  --  there was nothing she could do about that  --  but the protection of some tender useless act . " I was n't thinking , " she said , and reopened the door . After Opal had gone to bed , Eunice slowly took down her hair and let the wind lift it and blow through it . She was not discouraged . She did not feel that she had been repulsed , as in her early , all-or-nothing life she would have felt . All-or-nothing was only the shape she had tried to impose upon life ; life was not really like that at all . In the first days of her loving and being loved by Tom , she had been free of thought . She had dreamed , and remembered ; she had planned what she could do for him . It was odd . What had happened then to her body had freed her of her body . She had been tireless , sunny as sunshine , swift as wind . By being a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child again , to the time when there is no separation between self and body . No one , feeling what she had , could have dreamed of heaven or feared death or declared a war . Each day , beginning with sunup and ending with sundown , was enough . Each morning she awakened smiling , not in anticipation of anything . What more could come ? She smiled because she was smiling , because she and Tom were alive . The state was nothing she imagined . It was apparent to others . Peopleturned to look at her and Tom when they were together with the same open approving pleasure they showed for happy children . And she and Tom did n't care . They knew they were looked at , but they hid nothing . After what happened later , she might have believed that Tom had faked all that early glory . She wanted to believe he had . If he had , then she had lost nothing . You ca n't lose what has never existed . But she had no such comfort . It had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's faces and heard it echoed in their voices . People , complete strangers , were compelled to speak to them on a subject usually avoided even by friends . Strangers came up to them and spoke to them of their love . There was a restaurant where she and Tom ate sometimes , called , in honor of Theodore Roosevelt , " The Teddy Bear . " It was not an es/pccialiy cozy place , though she was never able to judge what the places where she and Tom ate were really like . The minute they entered any hotel or eating place , it enfolded them like a home . Waitresses and bellboys stayed near them , as if they provided some comforting warmth . Food she ate with Torn was the best she had ever put in her mouth . There was a waitress at " The Teddy Bear " whose name was Bessie Sweeney . She and Tom always called her " Sweet Bessie " because when they first knew her , she continuously sang the praises of sweet basil as a seasoning . Tom also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name was Irish , she had a gypsy 's black bramble hair and big hoop earrings . Sweet Bessie used to hover over them , eating them up with her sad , shining eyes . Eunice and Tom were both aware of her , but nothing in those days troubled them . Nothing made them self-consciousor pushed them into any unnatural act or nonact . Sweet Bessie would hurry back from her other tables to be near them . They seemed to satisfy some longing in her , to prove something to her . One evening , while Tom was getting their coats , Sweet Bessie leaned over the table to speak to Eunice , watching out of the corner of her eye to keep track of Tom . " If I had a man who treated me like that , I would turn myself inside out for him . " She whispered , her voice trembling with feeling . The words touched Eunice and troubled her . Did n't she value Tom enough ? When they left the restaurant , she told Tom what Sweet Bessie had said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said indifferently . At once , questions came into her mind : When ? Where ? But the rush of their conversation , the closeness of their bodies in the bite of the bitter mountain air , put the questions out of her mind . And only afterward did it come back to her . " When , oh when ? Where ? " Whatever the answers to these questions were , Sweet Bessie proved that other people had believed that Tom loved her . The two of them had been a magnet ; and even with Tom as handsome as he was , they were n't so extraordinary a couple as to turn , by their looks alone , the heads they had turned . Something , when they were together , came into being , and it was this people saw and believed in and wanted to become a part of . It was like a religious revival , but stronger . Revivalistshad to drum up trade , to ask people to come up front and say they believed . She and Tom had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said so . Observers found some saving grace in them . This was nothing Tom could have made up to fool her , because other people saw it and believed it . One other time , in this same restaurant , there was a woman whose looks Eunice despised , forty , at least , her hair colored with something artificial , her mouth painted , a scraggly fox fur wrapped around her long yellow neck . " How cheap ! " Eunice had said . And Tom , for the first time since she had known him , had flatly contradicted her . " Cheap ? " he asked . " What 's cheap about trying to be as young and attractive as you can ? That woman has n't given up ; she 's still living . She 's a woman , not a housekeeper or a teacher . " At the word " teacher , " Eunice flinched , not for herself , but for Tom . He had forgotten that she was a teacher . " What 's wrong with not giving up ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was revealed to Eunice that men did n't look at these cheap women in the same way another woman did . Everythingthis woman did praised men . Men wanted women ( did n't they ? ) young , bright-colored , vivacious . That was what this woman was trying to be . Beside her , Eunice knew ( for all she was so mad about Tom ) , she did n't praise men . What she praised was some old ladies ' idea of neatness and propriety . This dyed and painted woman had come , like Sweet Bessie , to their table . She had a bunch of batteredimitation violets pinned to her fur . She unpinned these and put them , without a word , in Eunice 's hand . And for an instant , Eunice saw , under the paint , back of the lines of her face , dragged down by disappointments and hatreds , a glance as clear as water , as fresh as real violets . The look was for Eunice , but it was because of Tom . Alone , Eunice would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one clear look , the woman sank back out of sight , behind the years and the hatreds . It was a real death , and right there before their eyes . Eunice left the restaurant crying . She was living inside a mysteryvisible to others , she felt , but invisible to her . What seemed the most natural thing in the world to her and Tom , their deep mutual love , seemed unnatural , or at least unusual , to others . Was love so much a miracle in the world ? She never spoke of marriage ; nor did she often think of it . If Tom wanted it and spoke of it , she would listen . It was her delight to want nothing but what he wanted . She was happy without hope . The futurep173for her was never further away than the date of her next meeting with Tom . The nearest they had come to anything resembling marriage had been during an Easter vacation , when Tom got the loan of a cabin belonging to a friend . The cabin was a one-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , a cookstove at the other . They did n't pay much attention to the cookstove . She did n't suppose marriages could really he lived the way she and Tom had lived their week of marriage . Childrenand work would get in the way . But children and work were God 's punishment to Adam and Eve , were n't they ? And there was no use pretending , was there , that a marriage was better because the man and woman had to be separated most of the time ? Separation could only make a marriage better if the man and woman did n't love each other  --  and she and Tom did , and they were almost never separatedduring that week . There had been a heavy snow on Good Friday , a wet , clinging snow that whispered down about them , walling them in with whiteness and silence . They heard the snow fall , they saw it , and they smelled it , too . It had a raw , sweet fragrance like the scent of something green , blown across water ; they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to say what the smell was . Buckwheat blossoms , Tom suggested , or greasewood in bloom , or the scent of greasewood burning ? They never had enough of that sweet snow and of guessing where its fragrance came from . And for Eunice , there had been somethingbridal about all that Easter whiteness . Soon they were like the snow : untimely , unseasonable , paying no attention to clock or calendar . They lived on their pulses and by their appetites ; though these imposed an orderliness of their own upon them . They did not eat or get up at any which time ; there was a pattern , but it had their own shape , not the shape of someone who had to be back at the store or behind the teacher 's desk at a set hour . Eunice felt guilty for a day or two . She missed her prison . She wanted to hear the school bell ring and to salute the flag on the stroke of nine . Then she stopped thinking about her past life . If she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . She lived in the center of the snow , in the center of a bed , at the mid-point of her life 's being . There was no division in her life , and this concentration , like a magnifying glass , revealed the world to her with a sharpnessshe had never known before.  |p174On  my deathbed , the world I remember , she thought , if one remembers , dying , will be the world of that snowy Easter . And on the wind tonight , the dry , barley-stubble Tract wind blowing off the desert , I can still smell the wet honeyed fragrance of that snow . She could smell , too , the pinewood scent of the fire in their cabin cookstove ; she could smell the coffee Tom made and brought to their bed each morning . He was more womanly in many ways than any woman . He had a woman 's handiness and pleasure in household tasks . The contradictoriness of his body and his temperament astonished her . From what she had heard of men , she had believed that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a trial to live with . Women spoke of waiting for their husbands to get out of the house in the morning . They prepared for their return at night with all the wariness of a householder fearing an invasion . Tom was no trial to live with . They awakened each morning in their timeless world , in their room , milky-white with sunshine reflected off snow . Neither said , " I wonder what time it is ? " It was now . They smiled at each other and sometimeswent back to sleep again ; more often opened their arms to each other and started their day with the love-making with which the night had ended . He was a long , fondling , silent lover , partly from preference , partly from policy . Talk , he said , might distract him . She practicedwhatever he preached . He was womanly in that he loved to be loved ; clasp or be clasped was all one to him . In the beginning , she had believed that such transports as she experienced would , if continued , kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom laughed at her . She found she was hardier than she had imagined . She developed another worry . Had nature intended her for a brothel or harem ? Tom laughed some more  --  at that idea and at her words . " You 're all right where you are . " The feeling she had with Tom was as strong as any other natural wonder , stronger than many . What she felt with him put out the sun and the stars ; stopped the wind from blowing , the snow from falling . In the timeless moment it seemed impossible that time would return , or that the earth , which had ceased , could take shape again . She puzzledher head about it . How could the eternal cease ? Would she not always live in the power of that transcendent moment ? No , time returned , and with it the world , more real than ever before . When they went into town at four in the afternoon , the streets and the people on them were as entrancing as if she had returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People , people , she wantedp175to cry , oh how beautiful , oh how touching ! A woman sweeping her porch ; what a grandma she was : there was love and clean cupboards and rice puddings in every stroke . A man reading the afternoon papers , one foot on the bottom stair of his front porch ; he could not move until he had the war news for the day . A ten-year-old signing thesnow on a vacant lot with his tracks . In the timelessness of their cabin , she had forgotten signboards and sidewalks ; piles of new potatoes andold apples ; earmuffs and runny noses . In the emptiness of eternity , inthe aridity of passion , she had , without knowing it , grown homesick for something domestic and passing . Though their days were not altogether undomestic . They ate brown bread and strawberry jam with the coffee Tom made in the morning . They played catch with a baseball left by some summer visitor . Tom had brought a Literary Digest with him and he sat her down and gave her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth-graders and knew more about Black Jack Pershing and Papa Joffre than he did . He was proud of her . " You are quite a woman , " he said . In the last week in June , after their Easter miracle of strawberries in the snow , Eunice phoned Tom to tell him she could come to Fort Collins on Friday . They chatted for a minute or two , then Tom asked her if she had forgotten that this was the weekend of the annual gettogetherof Swift men in Denver ? She had , she had . Tom had shown her the leaflet announcing the affair , and they had laughed together at the packing company 's attempt to combine business and pleasure : sack races and instructions to push mutton and pork ; homemade ice cream and sermons on the nutritiousness of kidneys and hearts . Tom hated the prospect of going . " There 's not a man on earth who can tell me a thing about livers and lights . And I 've won the sack race three years hand running . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sister , are you telling me ? " " There 's the homemade ice cream . " " That 's all I 'm going for . " They arranged to meet the next weekend , and Eunice , though disappointed , accepted the postponement cheerfully . She was prepared to live Tom 's life ; if it was livers and lights and sack races for him , why , she asked for nothing better for herself . She knew that if he wanted to , he could take her with him to the Denver meeting . She did n't for a minute consider this neglect , or hold it against him . In/stead , she worried about the lies she caused him to tell  --  even without such complications . To her , Tom was a real Lincoln , a man of such deep probity that she had tried to invest herself with earlier lovers to ease Tom of any concern he might feel as the despoiler of a virgin . " Most women , " he had told her , " want to convince me I am the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard to do the opposite ? " She could n't very well tell him her reason : that she wanted to take his burden of guilt from him . And since she could n't tell him , Tom believed she was trying to impress him with the number of former admirers she had had . He did n't understand that her picture of herself , as an already fallen woman , was to keep him from feeling any responsibility for her fall . She thought there was sin in their lovemaking ; and she supposed , rightly , that most people would believe that Tom , an experienced man , fifteen years older than she , was the greater sinner . She did n't want this idea ever to occur to Tom . She was determined to be his equal in sin and to spare him all remorse . When she discovered the mistake she had made about the date of the Denver meeting , she decided on a thorough cleaning out and refurbishingof her room . It would help pass the time until she could see Tom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's accumulation of lesson plans , hectographed maps , notes from parents , Valentines and Christmas cards from pupils , pictures cut out of magazinesfor class use , graduation programs , and the like . Before she knew Tom , she had kept such things . But now ? She would as soon think of saving each year 's fallen leaves . They had served their purpose ; they were a sign of something that had passed . It was in the midst of this discarding and sorting that she came upon the Swift and Company leaflet and saw that the date of the Denver meeting was not this weekend , but the next . She was sitting on the floor , two desk drawers beside her , when she made the discovery . how that piece of paper had got in with the school stuff , she did n't know ; but she blessed the industriousness that had led her to find it . Now they need n't wait for a week . She kissed the leaflet like any schoolgirl , jumped over the drawers , and was halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better idea . Instead of phoning him , she would go at once to Fort Collins . Tom himself would have discovered his mistake by the time she got there , and they could have a meeting of the kind she had often longed for , spontaneous , unplanned . Her mind , as she packed , was filled with images of this meet/ing . She would open the door to Tom 's room , Tom would look up , doubt his eyes , then stand , arms opened to her . And he would groan as he always did in that sweet suffering way when he clasped her . Tom was not in his room when she reached Fort Collins , and the clerk did not know , or at least would n't say , when he would be back . After their Easter in the snow , Tom had given her a key to his room . Not because either of them expected that she would ever have occasion to use it . But he gave the key to her as another man might give a woman a ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had opened his life to her . She kept it with her always . When the clerk told her that Mr. Mount was not in , her first thought had been to wait his return in the lobby ; then she remembered her key and went up the dust-smelling stairs to his room . There were some letters half under his door , and she picked them up without looking at them and took them in with her . The room 's emptiness was not the emptiness left by a man who has just stepped out . Yesterday 's paper , still folded , lay on the table . A vase of drooping roses was circled with fallen petals . Two empty beer bottles stood on the window sill . The air was warm and stale . She pushed up the windows and heard the sounds and smelled the scents she had imagined back in Millstone ; but what she had not imagined was that she would stand alone at the window , that Tom might never have discovered his mistake . She went to the closet where Tom kept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone . She felt desolate and leaned her face against the sleeve of his winter overcoat , the one he 'd worn when he 'd come in out of the rain on the night she 'd first seen this room . Why had she believed that by power of the imagination alone she could have him waiting here for her ? Why had she refused to act like any sensible woman , and phone him ? Did she think her love was miraculous enough to convey messages without benefit of phones ? That she had only to want Tom and he would be where she wanted him ? For a while she would not admit defeat ; she would go to Denver , where he had mistakenly gone , find him , and regain the happiness she had thrown away by her foolishness . She went again to the window , and there in the last light looked down at the letters that she still held in her hand . She read the address on the top letter as a person in pain reads a newspaper , hoping to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's hand and was postmarked in Denver two days ago.  |p178Without  making any decision , her hands operating mechanically , she opened the letter and saw in a glance , without knowledge of individualwords , its meaning . Its meaning was : I love you , I wait for you . I remember . The woman 's name was Clara . Eunice wanted to believe the letter silly , stupid , wicked . It was exactly as silly , stupid , and wicked as every letter she had ever written Tom . He was with Clara at this very moment , she supposed . The letter had been intended to reach him before he left , to bring him , as Eunice liked her own letters to do , a welcome before they met . She leaned against the window sill and looked out into a world that had become an assortment of meaningless shapes . She stood at the center of it , still alive , but alive to no purpose . She had lost every reason for action ; move or stand still , close her eyes or open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An image came to her , the only comforting one , of some far-off mesa where she could lie face down , unseen , blind as a stone , never again speaking or spoken to . She was as dry of tears as a handful of dust . And though the world she saw with Clara 's letter in her hand appeared unreal , the true unreality was in the world she had believed in before reading it . If Tom did n't love her , she had been living in a mirage . She slowly opened the next two letters . The first was typed without dates , or names of any kind , Tom 's or the writer 's . It was written in the third person , the writer calling herself " your correspondent . " It was written deep in the night after Tom had left the woman . Eunice could not bear to look at it , let alone read it . It was a mirror in which the face she saw was her own . The third letter , painstakingly written on lined tablet paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The situation now appeared to Eunice to be laughable ; but she was as far from laughter as she had been from tears . She had begun by hating Clara . But Clara was as much betrayed as she . It was completelydark , the middle of the night for all she knew , when she left the window . She had stood for so long in one place that she moved creakingly , like an old woman . She had suffered a lifetime at that window , the hours had worn her like years . She was very hungry . She went to Tom 's kitchenette , opened a can of salmon , and ate it , using her fingers ; she let the salmon juices dribble where they would . She pulled Tom 's fold-away bed out of the closet and , with the three letters in her hand , lay down fully dressed . Sometimes she slept . It was hard to tell sleeping from waking . When she slept , the pain of what had happened did not leave her . When she was awake , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sleep she touched the letters constantly , as if trying to prove to herself that they were real . As soon as it was light , she got up and washed thoroughly . After she had made and drunk a pot of black coffee , the torpor of the night left her . She sat down and wrote Tom a letter . She could not write " Dear , " or even his name , only : " I add my letter to the three which I found here . I am leaving my key . I will never see you again . Eunice Fry . " She put the four letters on the library table , tidied the two rooms and herself ; then she stood in the doorway looking back at the scene of her life 's beginning and ending . Would she have walked into this room on that January afternoon if she could have seen how she would be leaving it ? But what had changed ? Was Tom now any different from the man who had come to her , who brought her alive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had really changed , except an idea in her head . Did she want to live with an idea in her head or with Tom ? With Tom , of course . She went to the table , took her letter and tore it into pieces . Tom was some other kind of man than she had believed him ; that was all . No , that was n't true . All that was true was that he did not , when away from her , live as she had believed he did . Did that change anything ? Make untrue what was true when they were together ? No , it was all still true . Nothing , in so far as she was concerned , had changed . She loved a man , did n't she ? She might be unable to love all that man did , but she loved him and she did not want to be separatedfrom him . She spent the rest of the day discovering more about this man she loved . She did it quite deliberately . She did not want ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through his apartmentcarefully and brokenheartedly . The truths he had told her , the hundred little absolute truths he had told her ! These hurt her more than the lies . The truth about fig bars and Old Farmer 's coffee and vegetables stored in a churn and eighty-nine dollars in the bank and an insurance policy with the Provident Mutual and two suits to his name and brown eggs and a push broom to sweep with . These truths were the bounty he had freely given her . She went about , sick with gratitude , like an old mother who thinks , as she dies of a blow from her son , how sweet he has been to spare her the pain of strangling . She found a notebook in which Tom kept track of everything , expenses , towns visited  --  and especially women . She was there , given no more space and no less than the others . The notebook told thep180truth about her ; she supposed it told the truth about the others . I love a Mormon , she thought , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not look at : the Mormons married their women and took care of them . She had no intention of staying another night . She asked herself why she was staying at all and found no answer . She stayed because staying was easier than leaving . She shrank from showing her face on the street ; she had the self-consciousness of a person just out of a prison or a hospital ; she believed that what had happened had marked her . She stayed because she was tired , because a crushing apathy and sleepiness weighed upon her . She walked from one square of the kitchen linoleum to the next , counting squares like a man counting fence palings or railway ties . She had become very clean all of a sudden , and took her second bath of the day , scrubbing carefully . She slept without awakening , but heavily and miserably . At ten o'clock on Sunday morning , she was dressed and ready to leave . What she had experienced had made Fort Collins a foreign country . She sat by the window watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women together ; married , nothing to hide , their love as respectable as their churchgoing ; the women in pretty summer dresses ; the roast cooking in the oven at home . How had she cut herself off from them ? As she sat looking , a car stopped in front of the hotel . It was one thing , she saw at once , to tell her mind to accept the facts and another for her body to experience them . Tom was in shirt sleeves with suspenders . The woman beside him was about his age , small and darkhaired ; she wore a pink ruched shirtwaist , and on the arm , which she stretched with easy familiarity across Tom 's shoulders were two heavy gold bracelets . Where was that animosity that made it possible for a woman to kick and scratch her rival ? She would like to experience it . She felt no animosity , only a deep throbbing hurt . Tom got out , looked up and saw Eunice , or at least a woman ( he made no sign of recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his companion , who was already on her feet , to stay where she was . He talked with her for a few minutes , then he entered the hotel . Eunice remained exactly where she was , the letters in her hand . When Tom entered the room , she said , " Hello , Tom . " Tom closed the door behind him and stood with one hand on the doorknob looking at her . " What are you doing , sitting here watching me out the window ? "  | " I was n't sitting here watching you , Tom . I was sitting here reading your mail , " Eunice said . Tom stared at her and the letters she held up ; then he laughed like a man who finds that the joke is on himself ; and who , in the long run , has never really expected anything else . " What would you have done if I had brought her up ? " he asked . Eunice was grateful that he said " her . " If this was Clara , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eunice answered . " You can bring her up now if you want to . " " I do n't want to , " he said . " You stay here . " When he came back , he said , " So you scuttled up here to spy on me ? " He spoke matter-of-factly . It was the word " scuttle " that hurt her . " I did n't scuttle , " she said . " I walked up , happily . No , I ran up . I thought you would be here . " " How could you think that ? After what I told you ? " " I thought you had made a mistake about the date . That you would find it out and still be here . " " I told you that to save you from being hurt . " The key lay on the table beside her , and he looked at it . " I had no idea when I gave this to you that you would use it for spying . " " Neither did I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss me , she thought , it is too soon . But a kiss was not in his mind . What he wanted was the letters . She handed them to him ; he looked at the two handwritten letters indifferently , but the third , the typed letter , he held in his hands , turned it over and over as if afraid to read it . Red spots burned on his cheekbones , and the corners of his upper lip lifted in the spasmodicway that characterized him when he was troubled . Finally , he took out the typed page , and , as he glanced at it , his hands began to tremble . With a sudden desperate motion , without putting the letter back into its envelope , he rammed both into his pants pocket and went quickly to the kitchen . Because he looked so sick , Eunice followed him . There was nothing in the typed letter , though she had only looked at it , not really read it , different from what was in the others . The only difference , in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been at greater pains to hide her identity . Did the letter have nothing at all to do with Tom 's sickness ? Did he tremble for the two of them , instead ? For their love , which he had endangered ? He had got himself a glass of water and was trying to drink it . The glass , in spite of his efforts to hold it steady , tapped against his teeth.  |p182She  reached up , took the glass , and held it firmly for him . He drank all the water , then she put an arm around him and helped him to the chair by the window . He lay back in it , the trembling lessening ; there was perspiration at the edge of his hair , and the sudden burning had left his face white and made the blueness under his eyes more apparent . " Do n't worry , Tom , " she said , " do n't be upset . Everything will be just the same . " He looked at her curiously . " You think so ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched her hair , then let his hand drop back into his lap . He looked at the key again . " I did n't intend it to bring you so much trouble . " She took the key and pressed it to her lips . " It told me more about you . It gave me more of you . I do n't want to love just a part of you . Whatever , whoever you are , I want to love all of you . " " Poor Eunice , " he said . " I am not poor . I am lucky . " " Not from where I sit , " he said . " From where I sit you look way out in left field . " She was not sure what that meant , and in any case she did not want to talk about it any more . If they did not speak of the letters , the enchantmentof their being together would take hold of her ; of him , too , she believed . She was already beginning to feel the familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing she need say . She need not even have faith ; she could doubt all she pleased , deny or renounce ; his presence was strong enough to overcome her . A quietness fell upon her ; she became whole . It was summer , it was midday ; light and warmth from an unclouded sun filled the room . She fed on the summery fragrances . The voices of the churchgoers , homeward bound , were cheerful . The scrim curtains lifted and fell . He closed his eyes , reached down , pushed her slipper from her foot , and , with his hand about her instep , held her foot firmly . " You are the only woman whose foot I can hold . " It was a ludicrous statement and perhaps a lie as well . Yet it was perfect for the moment and for them . It was the one touch she could at the minute tolerate ; it had a certain objectiveness about it which suited their condition ; a certain pitiful silliness . In every act involving touch he was infallible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know until he asked ; then she knew , but it was a secret she could not share . It was something she was born for and he was n't . What she was doing was marrying him . She was espousing him , Thomas S. Mount , this recently trembling man , this man with the letters from three women in his pocket and the sweat from his fright Mill visible on his forehead ; she was taking him for better or for worse , in sickness and in health , to be her wedded husband . In a way , she was not so much marrying him as recognizing that in the months ( , f their loving , a marriage had taken place . All she was doing now was accepting the obligations of her wifehood . She saw that marriagehad nothing to do with licensing and orange blossoms , old shoes and double-ring ceremonies . Church and state had been mixed up with Opal 's and Charlie 's marriage , but she doubted that Opal had ever felt herself half as much wife as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been told , a mystery . If there was to be a mystery , something had to be mysterious , unfathomable . This big , dark man , her husband , with his tender susceptible mouth and tired eyes , was her mystery ; he was able to meet all that rose in her , asking for the unknown , the unexplainable ; she went into the darkness with him , where the mysteries were ; he took the measure of her powers ; she struggled to apprehend and to endure him . He was her opposite ; he fulfilled the Biblical requirements , he was created male ; but , happily , time and his own inclinations had domesticated him . She longed for a witness ; since Tom could not be her witness , she called out to God . Oh , God , she said in her heart , hear me . I am this man 's wife . I will always he true to him . Tom opened his eyes . Something of what she felt must have shown i n her face , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something for me . " She took the key , which she still held , and extended it toward him . " Kiss it for me . " He looked at her questioningly . Another man might have said , " Do n't be silly . " Or , " What 's this mumbo-jumbo ? " Or thrown it out ( if the window . Not Tom . There was a good deal he could not do for her . But he did not jibe at what she wanted and he could do , on , , ; rounds of silliness or lack of meaning to him . He took her word for what mattered to her . He also accepted some mysteriousness from her . I le leaned forward , grasped her hand , and kissed the key . That was the whole of her marriage ceremony with Thomas Mount . It took place in her head on Sunday , June 28 , 1915 at one p.m . At thep184time , at the moment Tom bent his head over her hand and kissed the key , she felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the world . Later , she saw that she had been mistaken , at least about marriage . Opal awakened with her nightgown twisted uncomfortably about her . As she lifted herself on heels and shoulders to pull it straight , she heard sounds she had heard before : Eunice crying , or Eunice " carryingon , " if those were better words for it . Nothing noisy ; worse to hear because Eunice was taking pains to be quiet . There was still a light under the door to the kitchen , but Opal had the feeling that it was very nearly morning . She got out of bed , and the night air flowingunder her gown was sweet as water . Eunice was at the kitchen table , face down , her hair spread about her on the flowered oilcloth . At the sound of the door opening , she sat up , and Opal had been right . She was not crying . Eyes and cheeks were perfectly dry . " Look at the clock , " Opal scolded her . " It 'll be light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . " " I ca n't sleep . There 's no use going to bed . " " You could rest , anyway . " " No . " " Look , Eunice , you ca n't spend the rest of your life longing for Tom Mount . " " It looks like I can . " " Yes , I suppose you can . There 's more than one way of committing suicide . " " Suicide ? I 'm not killing myself . I may not be happy , but I can tell you one thing  --  I 'm more alive than most people . " " You mean you 're suffering more . " " That 's one of the ways of being alive . " " Cut off your nose , too , " Opal told her , " to spite your face . Put salt in the wound . Starve yourself . Why , you have n't half come up to all the ways people can suffer . You 're sitting here taking your suffering pretty comfortable : nice kitchen for it , bothering nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep 's eyes and letters . " " I have n't been writing him . How could I ? I have n't known where he was . " " Eunice , where 's your pride ? A man runs off , do n't tell you wherep185he is , and all he has to do is turn up again and you 're waiting with open arms . And legs . " " Do n't be dirty , Opal . " " I 'm not dirty . I 'm just truthful . " " Tom never did cast me off . He never did give me the go-by . " " He never will cast you off . He hoards women . He ca n't bear to part with a one . They might come in handy sometime . Cause him some real trouble sometime and see how long you last . " " I do n't want to cause him trouble . I want to help him . I 'm married to him . " " Look , Eunice , you can tell me that and I know it 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way to other people and you 'll end up in the asylum . " " I know that . " " When I think what that man has done to you in two years ' time ! You sit there with your hair streaming down , your skin yellow , and your eyes big as saucers , and I declare I ca n't even remember the girl you were when you first came to my house . She 's lost , that girl . Sunk , gone . Nothing left but . . . I do n't know what to call you . He 's no good . Ca n't you face that ? " " I face it . But I do n't stop loving him . Any more than God does . " " Any more than God does ! " Opal repeated . " Any more than God does ! Now you are really going out of your mind . You 're not called upon to play God to Tom Mount  --  or anyone else . All God asks of you is to act like a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . We do n't need any imitations from girls out of their minds . from running after men . " " I do n't run after men . " " You run after Tom Mount . I should think you 'd be ashamed to make such a nuisance of yourself . " " Oh , Opal , love is a nuisance . It 's a nuisance to me . But it is , it is . I ca n't change it . It is n't like schoolteaching . I ca n't pull down the flag and go home at three o'clock . It goes on all the time . It aches all the time , it hurts all the time . But I 'm not going to try to make love any littler , or change it . I 'm going to change myself . I 'm going to be strong enough to stand it . " " And that 's what you call love ? Something you have to be able to stand ? Something you have to steel yourself for ? " Opal felt herself getting hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad to say what she had to say . Perhaps the best thing she could do for Eunice would be to say , Leave this house . You 've wasted all your money on Tom Mount . See how much you love him when you have to start packing oranges or scrubbing floors to keep yourself alive . See how much he loves you . See if you 're strong enough for that . For Eunice 's sake , she ought to send her away . For her own sake , she wanted to keep her , the one good companion she 'd ever had . When Eunice did n't answer her question , she said , " Love is n't a nuisanceif it 's the right kind of love . It 's a comfort . " " You do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Why do n't I ? You tell me why I do n't know what I 'm talking about , Eunice . " The clock struck half past three . Opal pulled her gown closer about her . The air that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed was giving her goose pimples . " Go on , Eunice , why do n't I know what I 'm talking about ? " " You 've told me you did n't love Charlie . " " Charlie is n't the only man I 've known . " Eunice lifted her head , with all the interest and sympathy , Opal thought , of an invalid who learns you 've suffered from the same disease . " I did n't know you 'd been in love , Opal . " " It did n't last long . " " I 'm sorry . I wish you could 've known someone like Tom . " Opal knew she had come to the end of her postponements . There was nothing in her life she wanted less to tell : what she had to say might help Eunice . It might not , too : it might do nothing more than make Eunice hate her . She knew what a poor figure she cut , standing there , hair on end , her nightgown showing how much she needed a corset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it all in . If she had been an eighteen-year-old raving beauty , Eunice would think , Oh , she is irresistible , I understand exactly how it happened . Well , let her understand this , if she could , she who wanted to be deprived of none of Tom Mount ; here was another cubit to add to his stature . She looked about the room , still postponing . It came to her that she and Eunice had left Colorado , come to California , built this house , furnished this room , cleaned it this morning , all in preparation for this conversation . This was what it had been made for and was now waiting to hear . She walked over and closed the door . She felt the need of all the privacy she could get . " Maybe you 're right . Maybe I do n't know about love . Charlie surep187did n't teach me . Nor Tom Mount either . But I do n't think love 's limitedby my bad luck . I got enough imagination and spunk to see there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . " There was quite a long silence . The clock ticked . The wind blew around the house with its ceaseless sighing . The lamp , low on oil , went tup , tup , like a carp surfacing . " Tom Mount ? " Eunice asked . " Did you fall in love with him , too ? " " For a day or two , I think I called it that . Anyway , I went to bed with him . " Eunice , already perfectly still , became even quieter . It seemed to Opal that all the life ordinarily used for breathing or the circulating f the blood was concentrated wholly in Eunice 's eyes . They deepened and at the same time brightened . Opal could imagine a man facing a firing squad like that , everything in his eyes in his one last minute of living . Eunice hung on to life ; though dead , her eyes blazed . Drop , drop , Opal thought . You 've been shot . Do n't make me keep on killing you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kissed me , held me . Everything he did with you he did with me . Called me the same ames , said I was an Irish gypsy . . . " " He never called me that . " " Well , you 're the only one , probably . And if that 's enough of somethingspecial for you , in the man you say you 're married to , why , you 're welcome to it . Dear Tom , he never called me Irish gypsy . ' How 1 love him for his faithfulness . " " Do n't cry for me , Opal . " " I 'm not crying for you . Or me . I 'm just festering . I 'm just getting id of the corruption . And do n't think I 'm crying for Tom Mount idler . I 'm crying because I have to tell you all this . " " You do n't have to . " " Now look here , Eunice . You be the authority on love if you wantBut do n't start telling me you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Mount ! I 'll tell you who Tom Mount is in that combination . He 's the wholly ghost , spelled w h o 1 1 y . He 's not here . You love him , all you 're loving is yourself . He 's whatever you think he is and if you stop thinking , he do n't exist . " " I ca n't stop thinking . " " You 've got something new to think about now anyway . " " Yes , I have . " All that bonfire of life that had flared in Eunice 's eyes when Opal  |p188first  spoke had died down . Opal saw that Eunice was now back in the past , where this pain began . " When ? " Eunice asked . " When was it ? " " When ? I 'm not like Tom . I do n't keep a date book . " " I mean . . . before . . . me ? " " Before . And during . " " Not . . . after ? " " Not after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh-Opal ' me . You were very careful to keep everything well hidden , Eunice . You turned out to be a pretty nifty liar once you got started . And you were the last girl I would ever have suspected of such a thing . " " Why , Opal ? " she asked the question like a child hoping in the midst of disaster for a trade-last . " I thought you were too nice a girl  --  for that kind of thing . " " But you were n't ? " " I 'd been married for twenty years , Eunice . That takes some of the niceness out of you . " " Did you go to his apartment ? " " Eunice , I 'll answer every question you want to ask me . I made up my mind to that before I ever began to talk to you . Now you make up your mind if you want to hear . Charlie was a kind of dirty talker . I 've got just the right kind of words to tell you all about Tom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to his apartment . Now what 's your next question ? " The beginnings of daylight were already in the room . Not enough to do any good , but enough to spoil the lamplight , to take the warmth and sparkle from it . It was the hour when lamps were blown out too early and householders either stumble around for a quarter of an hour in the dark or , admitting they have made a mistake , burn their fingers on hot chimneys and light up all over again . Opal resisted the desire to have it all one thing or another and waited for sunup to put out the lamp . She would have given a pretty to stand outside and look in at the two of them , gaunt-eyed and draggle-tailed from worry and want of sleep ; and , off a mile or so to the south , Tom Mount , she would bet her bottom dollar , was sleeping like a baby . " What 's your next question , Eunice ? " " There are n't any more . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A long time ago , when the worst thing had happened to  |p189me  and Tom , I tried to help myself by thinking I was no worse off than a Mormon woman . They share one man , and it 's even a part of their religion to do that . But they share a man they love . It might be like having Tom around , in some ways , to be with another woman who loved him . Then we could talk about him , maybe ; I love to talk about Tom . But I ca n't listen to you . You do n't love him . " " No , " Opal said , I sure do n't love him . What 's lovable about him ? " . Eunice said , " You want me to say he 's honest , industrious , a good provider , do n't you ? That 's what lovable means to you , is n't it ? " " No , " Opal said . " I know better than that . I had twenty years of learning that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ei-t her . " Eunice said , " I 'm going outside , Opal . I 'm going to take a walk . " " You 're not going off hunting Tom Mount , are you ? " " No . But I ca n't go to bed and I ca n't sit still . And I ca n't be where you are either , for a while . " " I was afraid of that . I knew you might feel that way . " Eunice stood up and shoved her hair into some kind of order with her fingers . " If only he had meant something to you . You could have had some excuse for killing me , then . " " Killing you ? " " Do n't you think it kills me for you to have been with him . . . you . I do n't mean just the word , Opal . But you , that body . . . maybethat nightgown even . On some night when I loved and missed himso . Do n't you think that kills me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told you , Eunice , I did n't know about you . And I wanted Tom Mount to mean something to me . God knows , I wanted him to . " The two women faced each other , Eunice so much taller and younger and wrapped all about with the pride of her suffering . She had the strength for it and she flaunted it in Opal 's face . " Opal , I pity you from the bottom of my heart . " Opal took that kindly . " I deserve pity , " she said . " I would n't want to think you did n't pity me . " Eunice , the wind taken from her sails , said , " Well , do n't waste any pity on me . I do n't want any pity from you or anyone else . " " I do n't waste pity on you , " Opal said . " I envy you . " Eunice turned  --  she had started for the door  --  but she went on , without another word . " Leave the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Opal blew out the lamp . It was not yet sunup , but there was plenty of light to see by , light without shadows or warmth . She was alone and at the worst hour of the day , the hour when the light disguised nothing . It was an hour either to be sleeping or up to some purpose , plunged out of bed to get an early wash on the line or to pack a lunch for an all-day picnic . But to be up at this hour , wide awake in a spotless house that needed not a hand 's turn of cleaning , nothing to prepare for , no one to straighten up after ; no reason for being ! She went to the door and saw Eunice already a quarter of a mile down the road . She was n't sure that she was doing the right thing , trying to help Eunice to get over Tom Mount . Let her chase him , waste her money on him , break her heart over him . What was a woman 's heart for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only happiness she ever could have would be to keep that vow . She might not ever land Tom , but land him or lose him , she 'd be pretty sure always to have her pain for company . THE THREE of them saw each other coming , and unless they chose to turn tail and run , or to sit down on a stone and proceed no farther , were going to have to meet . Or one of them , hitting up a fast pace , might be able to outdistance the other two , reach the ridge they were all headed for , and be on his way down before the other two arrived . It would be an obvious action and look either discourteousor suspicious  --  and maybe both  --  but it was possible . Asa Brice was the only one to whom this idea occurred , and he was the one capable of carrying it out . He could n't recognize , at the distance he was from them , the other hikers , but he did n't want to meet anyone . He 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethinghuman , he 'd had it in that white body balanced in her dishpan like Aphrodite in her seashell . That was enough humanity to get him through the day without any good-morning hellos to hikers . Spiders had had a night of weaving , and he destroyed webs with every footstep . Meadow larks and blackbirds were already fluting , and the hot day to come was heralded by the chirping of katydids . Big white butterflies fluttered around the milkweed pods . He trod on a wild gourd vine and stooped to breathe deep of the rank smell , the wayp191another man might bend to drink of a spring . Stooping , he saw a snake 's imprint in the sandy dust and paused for a better look . The wind from the east , still fresh , blew over him as he touched the snake print with a finger . He squinted to follow the barely visible print of that scaly sliding , and what he had come out for came back to him : rapture . Chad , already enraptured , had n't come out to hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was filled to bursting with it and with speech . He had been talking to himself , talking to birds , talking to lizards , talking to God ; and everything he said was for Press to hear . Present or nonpresent , existent or nonexistent , cut no ice with him . He had the gift of tongues this morning and could converse with stones and read the meanings of clouds . He saw the two hikers coming , and as for him , let them come . He could pass them unspeaking , or make them stop and tell them his life 's story , including last night 's installment nd this morning 's promises . He was completely surrounded by magic , ml there was not one thing that could break the spell . He had n't been able to sleep for thinking of Press , and before dayightthe idea had come to him to go have a look at her house , see where she slept , stand where her feet had been , breathe in some of the air she had breathed out . By God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suitability of his action delighted him . It was proof of what he 'd sometimes doubted : he was as human as the next one . Looking askance at others came so natural to him he 'd often feared he 'd been left standing behind the door when the humanness had been handed out . He could size up things too well ; and he took the time to size them up . Ellen went around with her heart on her sleeve ; heart and soul both . She was the original inside-out girl . Give Ellen the smallest tap and you 'd hit a vital organ . All he wore on his sleeve was his brains and his doubts ; and the smallest tap hit them , too . He had dreamed sometimes , daydreamed , that is , that there was a key , some secret key , he 'd discover that would let him into the world here others lived and free him from looking before he leaped . Well , he had found that key , he was leaping , and all his looks were for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the key ; she had unlocked him , let in ) out of himself . He had lost his mind ; or at least he 'd lost the coat it Ii his mind on the sleeve , and it was the happiest mislaying of his life . The sun had come up as he walked toward the Cope house and thatp192was all right with him but not necessary . It made a fine light , resting in clouds like a cinnamon apple in a bed of pink cotton candy ; birds flashed across the sky ; the stubble was cobwebbed , and the cobwebs were bedewed ; a coyote gave him a familiar look , perhaps a leer left over from last night 's triumph . He gave him a wave in return ; the coyote grinned but did n't wave back . He did n't care . He had the key that let him in . He could take the sweet away from the spines of a cactus apple , think a joke into Zoomy 's jokeless mind , and mayleven learn to like his father . He had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a thing more , and he could digest that , too . He 'd been transformed ; that was enough of a gift . But to him that hath shall be given . Under the first window , where he planted himself to imagine Press sleeping , he had no need for his imagination . She came to her window , pulled there by his presence , for he made no sound . She came as if awakened from a dream to find that her dream was real . She smiled with her eyes and her lilts ; she moved her hands toward him . She had on a white nightgown , deep-necked and sleeveless ; and at first , waking up so fast , this did n't trouble her . Later , it did . He had heard that women , when they firwoke up , were often a sight to behold . Press was , but not in the wa the saying suggested . She was a sight to behold in her beauty . Hi knees had a tendency to buckle , not from weakness but from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept them straight ; a time fo kneeling might come , but this was n't it . They did nothing but loo and as far as he was concerned , there was nothing else he wanted t. do . She was the key that opened him to the rest of the world , but h tween them there was no need for keys . They were open to each other It was a strange thing that a girl in the flesh , a girl he loved , a gir whose breasts were more visible than the breasts of any of his imag fined girls , should make him want to kneel . When he imagined girl his knees were never what he wanted to be on , and though he saw al t Press 's beauty , it was her sweetness and her goodness , he thought , that really moved him . He believed that he would have loved her for these qualities , no matter what she looked like ; he believed that he was filled with true wisdom to be able to see , beneath the disguise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved her in spite of her beauty and was carried away by her quick movements , by the trembling of her eyelids and by her mouth 's courageous , shamefaced smiling . These were not chancy , like beauty , but Press herself making herself known to him.  |p193He  had no idea how long they had stayed , gazing at each other . If she had not left , he might still be there . But she came to herself , suddenly , pulled her gown closely about her , and without a single good-by for him went out of sight into her room . It was sudden and it hurt him , but he understood it . All at once , the way she was dressed and the time of day it was had come to her . He had n't hung around hoping for any reappearance , but had lit out across the hills . He knew when j he 'd had a gift ; and when he 'd had it , he did n't spoil it by asking for more . Eunice knew that she was walking through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name she had given to such mornings at other times in her life . Asked what kind of a morning it was , she would have answered , " Fine , " in exactly the same way she would have said that two and two make four . It was a fact , but she had no feeling about it . She walked fast , avoided cactus , rocks , squirrelholes , as well as ever ; but her body was only a means of transportationand the passing landscape only a means of occasional distraction from pain . Of the two facts she had learned since the night before , she did not know why the bitter should crowd out the sweet . Tom was here . Why could n't the sweetness of that fill her mind ? He was here ; he had come this unbelievable distance . She would probably see him today . There had been sadness in her meeting with him last night , and disappointment . She had expected at the very least that they would walk together in the moonlight , speak of the wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new coming together . It had not happened ; but she had known of whom she said this . She was going to love the man Tom Mount was ; she had espoused him in full knowledge . It was a kind of unfaithfulness even to ask him to be different . So Tom 's arrival , whether she saw him as much as she would like or not , was her blessing . And it was not her blessing that filled her , but the knowledge , the trivial knowledge , in the face of all she already knew of him , of his having made love to Opal . She could not blame Opal ; Opal had known nothing and owed her nothing . Opal had done to her what she had done to Clara  --  and to all the others . They were a band of sisters . He was irresistibly lovable . " Take me . I am yours . " What else could a woman say to him ? Opal had agreed with her in saying " yes " to Tom . If " yes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . " She was not jealous of Opal . Tomp194was a man to cure you of jealousy . You could no more be jealous of him than you could be jealous of the sun . You missed his warmth ; but his absence only made you long more desperately for his return . She was jealous of no one , blamed no one , but terrible visions rose before her eyes : Opal , unbuttoning her soft , motherly clothes .. . She tried to walk her eyes out , or walk some other sight into them . On the afternoon in Fort Collins when she had first read Tom 's letters , she had left his apartment and bought a bottle of D'jer Kiss perfume , the duplicate of the bottle ( belonging to Clara ? ) she h ; ul found in his bathroom . She kept it with her ; she still had it . She made it a part of her life ; no vision of it and what it stood for could rise suddenly to sicken her . She lived with what the vision only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eunice the second . The boy had something on his heart to say ; but face to face with Eunice , he became silent . He could talk to a stone but not to a face like a stone . He was in love , something she did n't know anything about ; and never would , thrashing about the hills like a wild woman , her hair to her waist , and her white shoes ruined with dirt . He pitied her , but he had a notion to keep right on traveling . She looked like bad luck to him . Eunice stopped him . It was like meeting herself two years ago , when everything was before her . She spoke to the boy in the tone she would have used for that girl  --  pitying him for what lay ahead . " Do you like early-morning walks ? " The question stumped Chad . " I used to like them a lot back in Colorado , " she told him . " This is the first early-morning walk I ever took in my life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're Shel Lewis 's son , are n't you ? " she asked . " How do you like it here on the Tract ? " How ? He did n't know how . But he knew who . " There seem to be some very nice people here , " he said . " Did you meet some nice young people last night ? " He decided to chance it . " I met Press Cope . " " Press Cope ? She 's my best friend . " It seemed unlikely to him . Eunice was in his mother 's class . But with those words Eunice became a real person , a person who knew Press . He was now prepared to listen to her all day , but he never gotp195too hear a thing . Asa Brice arrived , and Chad could not talk of Press before another man . " They 'll be waiting breakfast for me , " he said , and went off down the ridge toward the floor of the valley . " The Tract 's full of walkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added , as Chad lit into a downhill jog trot . " He 's in love , " said Eunice . " Did he tell you ? " " He did n't have to . " Asa left it at that . He had too high a regard for love to make chitchatof it . It was sometimes hard for him to move out of his solitude into conversation , to shift from winds and trees , who asked nothing of him , to persons , who did . Eunice made this shift easy for him . They were both " old settlers " ; he had known her for six months . He had never before been so struck by her naturalness . Her hair , hanging . loose , and her white dress made her appear timeless . She was not hidden from him by anything passing or fashionable . She did not separate him from nature , because she seemed to be a part of nature . He had expected to do what Chad had done , to pass the time of day and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge to where small heat waves already formed and broke . After a while , he said , " If you 're thinking about turning homeward now , I 'll walk with you , if you do n't mind . " She said she 'd be glad for his company , and they started down the ridge together.  |p196IN  NOVEMBER , the Lewises moved into their new house . Chad still slept outside in the tent , but the rest of the family slept upstairs in the unpartitioned attic . There was an unused bedroom downstairs , but Joicey loved the idea of a spare room , a room ready on a moment 's notice for any visitor who wanted to spend the night . She had been brought up to believe that every nice family had such a room , but this was the first time she and Shel had been able to manage one . She had put the new bed in it and had outfitted the bed with a coverlet and bolster inherited from her Grandmother Covington . It was a beautiful room , and so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone staying in the room , now that she had made it so nice , did not set well with Joicey . When it got dark , she would light a lamp and put it on the bureau i n the spare room . Then , during the evening , if the fancy struck her , she would go stand in the door and admire the perfection she had created . Sometimes she would be able to persuade Shel to look at it with her . " Is n't it pretty , Shel ? " " It 's pretty , all right . Too bad about that bud , though . " " Too bad about it ? " " It had such a lively start to end up down here . Must feel like it 's been put out to grass before its time . " " Oh , Shell " In mid-November , during a prolonged spell of unseasonably hotp197weather , Shel stopped one night before going upstairs to bed to look into the spare room . " Let 's sleep down here until the heat wave 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon think of sleeping in her dress , and Shel did not insist . More was at stake , he saw , than comfort . He took one last sniff of the spare room 's coolness and marched upstairs to the hot attic . He had rigged up burlap curtains , hung on baling wire , to separate his and Joicey 's end of the attic from Ellen 's and Zoomy 's . Tonight , trying to coax a little air through the attic , he had pushed them back . The attic 's only windows were in the east and west gables , and Shel , undressing in the dark by the west window , said , " With this kind of weather it do n't seem possible that Thanksgiving 's almost here , does it ? " Joicey was on her knees saying her prayers , and it made her out of sorts to be talked to at such times . And since it seemed to her wrong to get out of sorts while praying , she would be in an unhappy mood when she got into bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shel kept his thoughts about the weather to himself . A heat wave in November was nothing unusual in Southern California , but it astonished the newcomers . After the long hot days of September , they thought summer had spent itself . Now there had been three days of near-ninety heat and no sign yet of any letup . When Shel got into bed , he could feel the warmth of Joicey 's body added to the heat of the night . Joicey slid over to her own bedrail . " You 're just burning up , Shel , " she said . " You 're not exactly a snowbank yourself . " They were both a little touchy about a matter in which they held opposite opinions , and in which Shel was getting his way . And the weather did n't help their feelings any . It was n't just the present heat . Except for a spattering in mid-October which did no more than temporarilylay the dust , there had been no rain since last April . Everythingwas bone dry . Joicey 's skin felt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flake ; and her hair , filled with electricity , rose up off her head like something magnetized , to meet the comb . They were still hauling water , and she never had an extra cupful for cooking or cleaning . And Shel had all that water stored out there in the weir box and in Jessup 's water wagon , to be used for planting trees ! Planting trees that would more than likely never live . It made her mad , and she had been against it and had fought thep198idea until she saw that she was fighting more than an idea ; she was lighting Shel himself . Then she stopped . She was against planting trees for as long as she believed that it was Shel 's stubbornness or impatienceor pride she was fighting ; the minute she saw that what she opposed was Shel himself , the fight went out of her . She could n't win , If that was the case , without Shel 's losing some part of himself . And she wanted Shel Lewis just as he was . If Shel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipes , not because he was mad at the Perkins Investment Company but because he was a man who believed in taking a few chances and would n't be himself unless he did , she would keep right on scrubbing the floor with bath water without complaint . In some ways , Shel , who was n't a believer , was a better Christian than she was . " You have to take some things on trust , " he said . " You 've got to believe the sun 's coming up tomorrow . And that there 'll be a normal rainfall . And you 've got to believe that some men mean what they say . You 've got to live with some faith . You 've got to bet on your own luck . " That was the kind of man Shel was . A man who would bet on himself and on his luck . He had some trust in the world . He thought it was on his side ; and so far , it had been . But if his luck changed and the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " Shel , " she whispered , " do you know what I wish I had ? " " I sure do . Something we ai n't got and ca n't get . Cold clabber . Or saucer peaches . Or maybe a pawpaw . " " No , I do n't . But I do wish I had a nice juicy apple . " " Some special kind , I reckon . Hard to come by . " " I 've been thinking about a Russet . They 're so juicy . " " How about a Maiden 's Blush ? " Joicey gave Shel , already over on his own bedrail , a shove . " It 's a little late for that , I reckon , " she said . " Maybe , " Shel said , " but it wo n't help you any now to push me out of bed . " They drifted off to sleep talking about apples . At the other end of the attic , Zoomy was wide awake . He was hot : Ind he had a bad conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents ' voices , he had been able to keep his mind off his own troubles . Now there was nothing to distract him . His throat was dry , his scalp itched with sweat , and his skin crawled as if he had chicken lice . On the cot against the north wall , Ellen was breathing evenly . Hep200wanted to wake her up . It seemed selfish of her to sleep when he could n't . He sat up cautiously so that he could look out of the east window . There was a light still burning in Chad 's tent . It would be cool down there and it would be fun to talk to Chad in the middle of the night . Still , he postponed getting out of bed . Under the best of circumstances he did not enjoy the prospect of the trip down the dark stairs , across the back yard to Chad 's tent . And these were not the best of circumstances . Because of what he was doing , he deserved to come to a bad end : to stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a coiled rattlesnake in the middle of the back yard . And even if he were to escape all these dangers on the way to the tent , Chad was likely to send him upstairs , right back through them again . He got out of bed . He was dying of thirst and sleeplessness and the itch , anyway . He reached under his mattress and got the tobacco bags that held his money and made his way fearfully down the stairs , through the house , across the yard , and to the tent , his ill-gotten money as safe as if he 'd earned it with honest sweat . Chad had both the tent flaps tied back and was lying naked on top of his covers , reading by the murky light of a lantern . Zoomy had n't made a sound , but Chad knew somehow that he was there . He put down his book . " Think you 'll know me next time you see me , Bud ? " Zoomy felt a little abashed . " I reckon so . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , anyway ? " " I could n't go to sleep . " " Keeping me awake 's not going to help you any . " Up to this minute , Zoomy had thought that what he wanted was coolness , or somebody to visit with , or maybe a drink . Now he knew he wanted to confess . He swung his moneybags back and forth . Chad ignored them for a while . Then he said , " You taken up smok-ing ? " Zoomy shook the bags so that the money clinked . " That 's not tobacco , " he said . " What is it ? " " Money . " " What 'd you do ? Hold up a bank ? " " There 's no bank to hold up . " " Well , one thing I know for certain , " Chad said . " You did n't work for it . "  | " I worked for it , " Zoomy said . " It was kind of unusual work , " he admitted . Chad bunched his pillows under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and waited . Zoomy wanted to confess , but he felt the need of some help . " This is n't half of what I 've earned , " he said , jingling his Bull Durhambags . " I reckon you got the rest out at interest . " " It 's buried , " Zoomy said . Chad picked up his book again . " You know the Anaheim irrigation canal ? " Zoomy asked . " Where nobody 's supposed to swim ? " " Sure . " " You know big , fat Ralph Sanchez , who rides around on the lookoutfor swimmers ? " " I know what Ralph does . What I 'd like to know is what you do . " It was this that Zoomy wanted to confess . Still , he thought Chad might understand it better if he could hear about it gradually . " Come on , come on , " Chad said . " If you have n't got anything to tell me , go on back upstairs to bed . " " I warn kids , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ralph . " Chad had been keeping his place in his book with his finger . Now he closed his book and put it on the orange box , which served as his bedside table . " That 's your work ? " Zoomy nodded . " Where does the money come in ? " " I charge . " " Who do you charge ? " " The kids . " " What do you charge them for ? And how much ? " " They pay me a nickel to swim all afternoon . " " They can swim without paying you anything . " " Yeh , but Ralph can catch them and fine them . I warn them if Ralph 's coming . " " How can you warn them ? " " I got two helpers . " Zoomy began , in spite of himself , to let somep202of the pride he felt for his business creep into his voice . " If I see Ralph , I give a kind of signal to the first kid and he gives it to the second kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the signal ? " " It 's a secret . " " What do the swimmers do when they get this secret signal ? " " Run . Or hide under a bridge . " " Who 's your helpers ? " " Burleigh Raunce and Buddy Cudlip . " " They help you for nothing ? " " Of course not . I pay them a penny apiece . " " For a whole afternoon 's work ? " " They do n't have to work for me if they do n't want to . " " How much do you make in an afternoon ? " " The most , so far , was thirty-three cents . I got $7.35 altogether now . " Chad whistled . " I did n't know there was that much money on the Tract . " " If the kids did n't pay me a nickel , their folks might have to pay a five-dollar fine for them if they got caught . It 's better for them to pay me five cents . Ai n't it , Chad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's cheaper , I reckon . " " That 's what I thought . " " Did you ever think why there 's rules against swimming in the ditch ? That people drink that water ? " " I got strict rules . We dip up a bucketful of water from the ditch and every kid 's got to clean off good before he goes in . He 's got to promise not to do anything in the water , too . " " Do anything ? Oh . You got any way of checking on that ? " " They got to give me their word of honor before they go in . " " And a nickel . " " I told you that . " " Has Ralph caught anybody yet ? " " No , siree . Not any of my kids , anyway . " " If somebody gets caught , wo n't he want his money back ? " " No . I 'll pay his fine . " " A couple of pieces of bad luck would wipe you out , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money without gambling , " Zoomy quoted his father . When Chad said nothing , but continued to stare at him , Zoomyp203said , " We help Ralph , too . We fish out dead cats and drowned squirrels . Stuff he 's supposed to get . And we do n't let anybody dirty in . " " Well , I reckon you do n't have anything to worry about , do you ? The Reverend Raunce will have you helping him preach soon . " " Oh , I 'm not in the same class as a preacher , " Zoomy protested uncomfortably . " No , I suppose not . You 're just helping a little stealing to go on  --  and making money out of it . " The word " steal " shocked Zoomy . " I do n't steal anything . " " Those kids are stealing the use of water that do n't belong to them , and you 're helping them . And getting paid for it . " Zoomy put his moneybags down beside the lantern and Chad 's book . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what kids paid it . " Chad said nothing . " Are you going to tell Papa ? " " No , I 'm not going to tell him . " Chad picked up his book , found his place , and began to read again , as if he had never been interrupted . Zoomy felt very lonely . The night was so warm ; the katydids were chirping almost as loud and fast as in the daytime . He could see the stars through the opened flap of Chad 's tent , and they , too , seemed out of place in the warmth . Stars and coolness went together . Katydidsand daylight . Everything was mixed up . He reckoned he knew it was stealing all along . He began to sidle carefully nearer the bed , ready to stop if Chad looked up from his book . Chad read on . Zoomy settled himself , an ounce at a time , on the edge of the bed . Without stopping his reading , Chad moved over . Something told Zoomy not to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay awake as long as Chad did . He took a last look at his moneybags , and his eyes closed . Ellen was suddenly wide awake , the dark night empty and towering above her . She began to think of Tom Mount . She did not imagine love scenes , or even a single touch . There was no conversation . She thought of him as something beautiful ; she was like a horse-lover remembering a noble animal or a naturalist recalling trees and mountains . She smiled to think that he was alive in the world she was in . She watched him walk , with his big thrown-back head and his soft tigering footsteps ; he moved his hands in wide , slow gestures whichp204made her think of water lilies . Oh , she knew very well that she was a girl dreaming of a man . She knew she was n't thinking of tigers or water lilies or mountains or forests . She knew she was thinking of a man ; and she knew that men married women , fondled and kissed them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stayed at a distanceand watched him . All at once , without knowing how the idea came to her , she thought , Zoomy is gone . She held her breath , waiting to hear some sound from Zoomy 's cot , but there was none . Her dream of Tom Mount vanished in a flash . She could dream of strangers , but for her family she acted . She tiptoed to Zoomy 's cot ; he was gone , and the bed cooled off from his body . She put her hand under his mattress : the moneybags were gone , too . Well , he had at least left with all his wits about him . She looked out the east window and saw that Chad 's tent was still lighted . She went downstairs , and with each step entered cooler layers of air . She moved in the air like a swimmer and felt her thighs go goosepimplywith the unexpected coolness . She walked through the house , loving it in a new way , without responsibility , like a visitor . The sky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of some other place shining through holes in the sky . The sky was a tent , and starlight leaked through like rain . Her feet had become tendersince summer 's barefoot days , and she walked on tiptoe to spare them . Snakes never entered her head . Katydids sang , thin and sweet . Was their song , like the light of the stars , part of a bigger sound , leakingthrough ? No , that was silly ; they were little animals fiddling . She entered the tent , and Chad looked at her as if he had expected her . He was wearing a book like a fig leaf . She had a momentary thought of what the book covered , but she knew all about that . She had no more interest in it than in an ear ; except that she felt some pity for the ragged unkempt way in which men were made , not neatly finished off like women . She did n't wonder at their always covering up . It was nothing to be really ashamed of , since God had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaunt either . Lying beside Chad , taking two-thirds of the bed , was Zoomy . " I missed Zoomy , " she whispered . There was no need to whisper . Once Zoomy was asleep , he was in some other world ; but the night and the lantern light and Chad 's grave questioning face made her daytime voice seem unsuitable . Chad whispered back , which surprised her . When there was no needp205of a thing , Chad did n't do it . He did n't waste himself pretending . She was halfway playing at not waking Zoomy . Chad was whispering because he felt like it . " He 's been here all night . " " All night ? Why , what time is it now ? " Chad 's watch was on the orange box beside the lantern . " Five , " he said ; then , after looking , " Five-ten . " " Are you going to sleep now ? " " There is n't time . " " Let 's go for a walk , Chad . Let 's see the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Blow out the lantern , " he said . " I 'll go outside with you . " Bending over to blow out the light , she saw Zoomy 's round face , gone back to babyhood in sleep . She turned down the wick and blew . In the darkness , speaking quietly but no longer whispering , she said , " He 's a baby . " Chad said , " He 'll have to get over that now . " " Why will he ? " " We 're going to have a new baby brother or sister . " " I did n't know that . Who told you ? " " Let 's go outside , " Chad said . There was no light yet , but the darkness had thinned . Something was going to happen over in the east . The air , though warm , had freshened . Chad had put on pants , but no shirt ; and though he did n't want to walk , he did n't want to stand either . He picked out a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . It was made of cement , as high as their shoulders . Water for the tree-planting filled it . Chad helped her up , then vaulted up beside her . Ellen put a hand in the warm water . A new baby spoiled her idea of them as a family . She had thought they were perfect as they were . " I think they 're too old for a baby , " she said . " They do n't think so , " Chad answered . Were n't we enough for them ? What would they think if one of their children said , " We 're going to have a new parent . " It would hurt them , would n't it ? " Maybe you 're mistaken , " she said . " Did Mama tell you ? " " Nobody told me , except my own eyes . " " I wonder why God let them go for ten years without any . " " What do you know about having babies ? " " Everything . "  | " Tell me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman  --  and it grows inside her until the baby 's ready to be born . It takes nine months . " " Why a married woman ? " " A mother needs a man to earn a living . " " Did you figure all this out for yourself ? " " Of course not . Nobody could ever guess that babies grow inside women . For one thing , you would n't think anybody could stretch that much . I did n't figure it out . Mama told me . Who told you ? " " I forget . " " Forget ? How could you forget a thing like that ? " Chad did n't answer her , and she leaned down again and lifted a double handful of water and let the drops back into the weir box with a rainy sound . It was still too dark to see a thing . Only their familiar voices kept them from being strangers . She spoke as if the night were a river and her words would be carried away on it . She could say anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She asked a question , as an example of how she would like the conversation to go . " Are you in love , Chad ? " She did n't expect an answer . Love was nothing Chad talked about . or himself . He would put her off with a funny answer , then say , " How about you , Sis ? " Then they would talk of Tom Mount . Chad said , " Am I in love ? Oh , Ellen , I wish I could tell you . " " Tell me , " Ellen said . " I wo n't tell anybody . " " I do n't care who knows . It is n't that . I want to talk about it and I do n't know how . You 're her age . You 're a girl . You 're not like her though . I mean , I think of you as my little sister . You are my little sister ; you 're more of a baby than Zoomy . Press is a woman . " " Why , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , forgetting the big thing , Chad loves Press , in the desire to set him right about the little thing . " She 's Press . I 'm going to marry her . " " Have you proposed ? " " No . She knows I 'm going to marry her though . " " Are you happy ? " " Happy ? Oh , God , I could die . " " With happiness ? " " No , not happiness . She wo n't see me  --  or if she sees me , all she wants me for is to wait on her mother . You 'd think I was a slave she'dp207bought for her mother . That 's the only way I can please Press . Are all girls like that ? If you loved a man , would you want him waiting on Mama ? " " No , I would n't want him to wait on anybody . I would want to wait on him , hand and foot , myself . You just think she loves you , Chad . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did she say so ? " " She said so . " Ellen thought of Tom Mount and what she felt for him . She consideredherself experienced in love . She spoke with absolute authority . " She does n't know what love is . " " I will have to learn to like the kind of love she has , because I will never want anyone else 's . " Ellen believed this . Chad did not make mistakes . This was the first sad happening of her life . Only yesterday , she had said to her father , " There is not one thing in my life I would change . " And even as she had said it , life had been changing about her : a new baby coming ; Chad unhappily in love . She could love , and not be loved in return , and she would get over it . She knew that . And not do anything wild or desperate either . But not Chad . He was final and he was desperate , otherwise he was n't Chad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love her . Keep on loving her . Never stop . " " Oh , Chad , I 'm sorry for you . " " Do n't be sorry for me . It will come out all right . I will make it come out all right . " She had a woman 's pessimism , which men construe as optimism . She could doubt that it would come out all right and still not despair . " There are other girls , " she suggested . " Not for me . " " If she was n't so beautiful , it would be easier . " " You 'd as well tell me it would be easier to be burned if fire was n't so hot . " Press was her beauty  --  even Ellen felt that , and felt its power . MedoraCudlip was as beautiful , compare complexion with complexion , eye with eye , mouth with mouth , as Press was . But she did n't live in her beauty as Press lived in hers . Medora had an outside and an inside , and you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , Now I can tell Chad about Tom Mount . But shep208could n't say a word . Compared with Chad 's sorrow , her happiness did n't seem real . There was no problem in it ; there was nothing to wonder and figure about ; there was nothing that needed doing . When happiness came , the story was over . She had no story to tell Chad . She had started happy . It was going to be light soon . The darkness was breaking up ; it was becoming tremulous , wavering like water . Chad 's face , which had been masked , now had eyebrows and a mouth . His eyes , as she had guessed , were closed . What she had not guessed , and could scarcely believe , was what the beginning light showed her : Chad had been crying ; there was a glaze of tears on his cheeks . He had cried the way he laughed , without a sound . Zoomy could bellow his head off , and often did , and she thought nothing of it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit beside her crying ! She could not say a word to him , not even touch him . She knew why he was crying , but she was too humble to believe any word or touch of hers could make up his lack to him . There was a small wind blowing and nothing for it to move , except a wisp of her hair and a feather fallen onto the water . She saw that the beauty of the coming light was not in the east , but in the hills to the northwest , which were changing in color from grape blue , with a dusty bloom , to the blue-pink of faded cabbage roses back in Kentucky . As the sun came up , heat came with it . She leaned over the water and picked up the feather , which had drifted toward her . It was finished with flying and unsuited for swimming . She leaned lower and pushed the water into waves and made them rock against the cement box with a hollow echo of the sea . She turned clear about and lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing that ; this water was not intended for drinking . It felt wrong , though , very wicked , like putting her feet into a bucket of new milk . " Chad ? " she asked . He turned and saw what she was doing , sliding ankle-deep , calfdeep , thigh-deep into the water . She was lifting her gown as she entered the water . Getting that wet was as strange as being in water at all . As she went down , Chad lifted her gown over her head . She was in water to her armpits and as modestly covered as when she wore her nightgown . But being naked in a covering of water did not feel the same as being naked in a covering of muslin . It felt better , to tell the truth : blissful in the steady , cool touch , which both covered her and left her naked.  | " Turn around , " Chad said , and she faced away from him , then felt the movement of the water as he slid in beside her . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own side of the weir box , like strangers sharing a bed . The water , like the darkness earlier , made them whisper again . " Oh , Chad . " The sun was still not up , but it would top Old Saddle Back any minute . She remembered stories of the war , of men crouched in trenches waiting for shells to go over . She felt that way about the sun , as though it were a shell about to explode and she was waiting , protected by the water , for it to shoot up over the mountain . What could be more beautiful ? And except that she had , without thinking , put first a hand and then a foot into the water , they would not be here at all . It had all come by chance , and this made her angry . " Chad , " she whispered . He looked at her inquiringly . " It 's just chance that we are doing this . " " Everything 's chance . " " It ought n't to be . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We might 've missed it . " " You can plan and miss , too . " " It is better to try . " Chad smiled at her . He had gone clear under the water and there were no longer any signs of tears . " I 'm going to try . " He hit the water with his fist . " Do n't think I 'm not going to try . " Forgetting that she had decided it was nothing to say , she said , " I 'm so happy . " Then she , too , sank down until she was completely covered and held her breath , planning not to come up until something told her the sun was up . They would shoot up together . Under water , clear as a bell , she heard Zoomy 's voice calling ; more accustomed to obeying it than the sun , she came up and went to the edge of the weir box . Chad was already there , signaling to Zoomy to be quiet . Except for a clump of cottonwoods away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the space between the weir box and the mountains . He filled it peculiarly , his big-legged homemade B.V.D.s down to his knees and his moneybags in his hand . But he did n't look little or lonely there , just peculiar . She had supposed that finding his brother and sister naked in the weir box would astound him , but what he was exclaiming about was something else . " Look , Chad , " he said , turning his back on them and pointing to the east . There , in the utterly clear air and a little to the left of Old Saddlep210Back , San Gorgonio , the mountain they could n't usually see at all , rose up enormous , white-domed , a world in itself , towering above their little flat stretch of earth . But it was n't this mountain , suddenly visible and nearer , that Zoomy was pointing to : it was a gray-green cloud that filled the pass on each side of San Gorgonio and hid the base of the mountain , so that its snow-peaked , blue-shouldered mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Gorgonio before ; but never of this gray greenness , which , for all it looked so solid , must be newly made . " What is it , Chad ? " Zoomy asked . " It 's dust , " Chad said . " It 's dust off the desert . It 's a big Santa Ana blowing up . There 'll be a bad wind before night . You go tell Father . Maybe he wo n't want to plant today after all . " The sun came up as Zoomy slammed the back door ; it came up fast , red and murky , and they heard Zoomy going through the house slammingdoors for every inch the sun climbed . " You get out first , " Chad said , and turned his back , so that she could climb out modestly . Ellen stood naked for a minute , arms uplifted in the dry warmth . Then she pulled her nightgown over her head and ran after Zoomy into the house . When Zoomy called at the head of the stairs , " Look out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed . " Which window ? " he asked . Zoomy pointed , and his father was there before he was . The cloud , in the few minutes Zoomy had been away from it , had risen higher . " Chad says there 's going to be a big wind . " " Chad 's right , " his father said . " It 's fixing to blow . " Shel thought that all he was deciding that morning was , Plant today or postpone till the wind 's over . Afterward , he saw that he 'd been deciding more than that . He was n't at the window more than three or four minutes , watching that green-gray cloud and trying to make up his mind what to do . The safest thing to do , he knew , was to leave the trees right where they were , well-balled and soaked , packed close together out of the sun and the wind on the north side of the shed he called the barn . Yet even that morning , he must have had some forebodings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those few minutes so well . " Time stood still " was a saying he had heard used to describe such moments in a man 's life . Time did not stand still . It moved at its regu/lar gait ; but occasionally a man 's mind , racing , seemed to leave time behind . So it was that morning , as he weighed the reasons for planting or postponing . He decided to plant . The hollows of Kentucky were full of men waiting for suitable weather . He would take the risk . Let the wind blow . He would fight it . Let Sylvester Perkins renege on his promises . He would sue him . Let the rains fail . He would water the trees , bucket by bucket , with his own hands . He gave Zoomy a slap on his bunched rubbery bottom . " Get your pants on , boy , we 've got a big day ahead of us . " He pulled on his own pants . Joicey said , " Are you going to plant in spite of the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , Joicey . I hope I 'm not making a mis-take . " " Light the fire , " Joicey said . " I 'll be right down and start breakfast . " that cloud in the east was both a threat and a promise . To most people on the Tract , since they had never seen one like it before , it was a promise : something was going to happen . Day after day , the skies had been cloudless , the heat intense , the breeze unvarying in its strength and direction of blowing ; a buzzard 's shadow passing over the plowed fields was enough to cause comment . They were all waiting : waiting for water in the pipes , for the heat to let up , for the church to be finished , for the school to start , for the rains to come . They did not know that they had been waiting for a Santa Ana wind , but the minute they saw that cloud in the east , they knew they had been waiting for it , too . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fading , they would , according to their various natures , have wished it , prayed it , willed it , ordered it back into the sky . They began to stake their lives on it ; if nothing came of it , they were done for . Not a one of them , except Raunce and the Mexicans , knew what it actually was , or could do . Not a one of them except Asa Brice cared about it as a thing in itself . It was a promise that something was going to happen , and that was enough for them ; though unless it blew their houses over , they were not sure what the promise was . They faced the east like Mohammedans that morning , and the cloud was their Mecca . Blow , blow was their prayer.  |p212Exce|pt  for that one distant smudge , the day was like crystal . Old Saddle Back , fifteen miles away , moved up to the edge of the Tract . The sun could be seen shining through the transparent ears of jack rabbits , feeding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles was what it looked , anyway . The rains might not come ; who cared ? They were drowning in light . The clarity of the morning air excited everyone . The Tract , underthat light , was a different place . The settlers had made a journey without travel , because the nature of their environment had changed . They felt as wild and irresponsible as tourists . What they did today would not count because they were away from home . Their senses , already worn to the quick by heat and dryness and waiting , were now pricked into still-greater aliveness by having something new to use them on . And the contradictoriness of the omens excited them . Out of this perfect stillness , would a wind come ? Out of perfect clarity , dust ? Out of perfect familiarity , strangeness ? 3 R. s A , like any good Mexican wife , was up before her husband . When she saw the cloud , she came back into their bedroom to tell Pete about it . " You wo n't have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Pete asked . He was comfortable ; he worked from necessity , not for pleasure , and he hoped Rosa was right . Still , he did n't trust Rosa when her conclusions gave him some unexpected pleasure . " A big Santa Ana is coming up . " " I am not so weakly , " Pete said , stretching himself and flexing his arms , " that I ca n't work if the wind blows . " " You are strong enough . I know that . But when Mr. Lewis sees that cloud , he will decide not to plant today . " " I told him I 'd be there . " " It 'll be a trip for nothing . " " Maybe . " He wanted to stay . He was n't like Shel ; he was n't trying to get anyplace . His grandfather had done that for him . All he wanted to do was to hang on to the four rooms that were left him of his grandfather 's eighteen . The adobe walls were thick and the window sills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hummingbirdp213whirred now , above the geraniums . Rosa , in a pink house dress , might easily be mistaken for a flower . Except for what seemed unchangeable in their lives , he did n't know how they could be happier . He threw back the sheet . " I better have a look at that cloud , " he said . " Do n't look at me that way . " " I 'm not looking at you any way , " Rosa said . " Why not ? " Pete asked . He stepped into his pants , and they walked out into the yard together . The coming Santa Ana did not excite him as it did the people on the Tract . He did not need a wind blowing up out of the east to convince him he was alive . They turned away from the dust cloud on the horizon to look at the village of Ramos , of which their house was the last outpost . There was no nonsense in the village of trying to make the grass grow in the yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a floor . Paths and flower beds were outlined with pebbles , shells , pieces of broken china , and colored glass . The flowers were none of them small or faint-colored : big red and yellow zinnias , purple bougainvillaea , red geraniums , hard-blue asters . No Mexican pretended that these flowers had been dropped down from heaven by the hand of God and had no responsibility except to Him . The flowers had a responsibility to their planters , and their planters never let them forget it , training them in ways which would make it impossible for them to be mistaken for any natural growth . The gardens were arranged in raised beds , and these beds themselves were interestingly shaped . Only along the houses where there was not much choice were there dull rectangular beds . Flowers were planted in Mason jars , hanging baskets of clay and willow , coffee cans , Suetene buckets , big seashells , sugar bowls without handles , old churns , and cracked chamberpots . The minute any plant showed a tendency to live a natural life , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or transplanted . The Mexicans did a lot of living in their yards , and they no more cared for wild , unshapedgrowth there than they cared for it inside their houses ; a tree was a nice thing , but it served man best cut up and nailed together in the shape of a table or a bed . It was the same way with flowers . In addition to the hanging baskets , thick amidst the branches of the pepper and umbrella trees , there was a lot of aerial bloom pendant from trellises and arbors and festooning downward from vines trained to run up trees . Birdcages hung with the flowers , and under this canopy of vines and birds and leaves and blossoms , babies andp214dogs lived as though in a handmade jungle . Petals and shadows fell on their faces . Water ollas sweated in the shade of jacaranda trees ; water dripped from the perforated tin containers placed on the tops of coolers covered with barley sacks ; water ran in ditches along the rows of vegetables and filled the basins at the feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide awake ; there was a smell of greasewoodsmoke and the sound of singing and wood-chopping . After long looking , Pete said , " I better eat and be on my way . " " If you go , I am going , " Rosa said . " Why do you want to go ? " Rosa had two reasons . She told Pete one . " I want to help Mrs. Lewis with the cooking . " " She will need it , " Pete admitted . She , or more likely Shel , had invitedsome friends in for a meal to celebrate the first planting on the Tract . " Do you know what she is going to cook ? " " How could I know ? " " Ground squirrels . " Rosa thought for a minute that this was a joke of Pete 's to persuade her not to go . " You ca n't eat squirrels . " " Back in Kentucky , they eat squirrels . " Mexicans were sometimes accused of eating dogs . Rosa herself had never eaten one ; but if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a well-fed , fat little dog rather than an animal like a rat , devoured by fleas and living in a hole in the ground . " Why ? " Rosa asked . " They are cheap , " Pete said . " With Shel planting trees and paying so much money to haul water , Mrs. Lewis says to herself , Somebody must save money , and squirrels are cheap . ' " " I had better take something along to kill the flavor . " " I do n't know what would . " " I can make them so hot no one could taste anything except the chili . " " They wo n't like that either . " " It will he better than ground squirrel . " " I did n't know you and Mrs. Lewis were such friends . " " We are getting to be , " said Rosa . " I want us to be . " While Rosa was getting breakfast , Julian Ortiz , who lived next door , came into the kitchen carrying his youngest brother , a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help takep215care of them in an aimless , loving way ; but Julian was careful and sensible with his younger brothers and sisters . He was Rosa 's age , twenty-two , unmarried , though with plenty of admirers . Rosa was n't one of them ; she was n't sure why . Perhaps the reason was that she could admire only Pete , or at least a man like Pete , while ulian was Pete 's opposite in most ways . Pete was big , strong , lazy , and wicked . Julian was small , quiet , industrious , pious . He looked precious , like something made by a jeweler . It was a surprise not to hear him tick . There was absolutely no way his perfect features could be bettered except to enlarge and coarsen them . He had beautiful , long-lashed eyes , firmly curled red lips , and a silky black mustache . There was nothing in the least girlishabout his small precise features . His nose was a man 's beak , and his Adam 's apple alone would stamp him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare to the waist and washing , in the back yard next door , to think him soft . He was small , but he was a weapon like any other man . In addition to everything else , Julian was religious . This certainly should not turn her against him , but a religious man who was not a priest made her feel uncomfortable , as if he were taking over some work or privilege that should belong only to women . If a man was religious , it cut her off from him . Part of her duty to Pete as a wife was to lead him toward God , to urge church and prayers and fasts upon him . It shocked her to admit it , but the truth was , she did n't want Pete a bit holier than he was . She wanted Pete to get to God , but she wanted to be the ladder by which he climbed . If a man made that climb alone , would n't his wife feel left out ? She would . No , religion was for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a part of the church . Feeling all this , she was especially polite to Julian . " Have you had your breakfast yet , Julian ? " " An hour ago . What I came over for , " he said , " was to see if I could ride with Pete to the Lewises ' this morning . " " I did n't know you were working for Mr. Lewis today . " " I am not working for him . " Rosa slapped a tortilla from hand to hand , trying to think what reason Julian could have , if he was n't working there , for going to the Lewises ! " I can drive over myself , if you think Pete wo n't want me . I have been asked to a picnic , " he said , " at the Lewises ' . "
