Much of the Viet Cong terrorism in recent months has been aimed at South Viet Nam 's national police , the canh sat . In one attack last week the raiders blew up the canh sat headquarters in Hien Nhon . In another , at Long An , raiders smashed a police checkpoint , killing three police . The enemy has good reason to try to cripple the cops . For the Vietnamese in the white uniforms do not handle only the usual policeman 's lot of random robbery and mayhem . More and more , they are meeting the guerrillas face to face . " What is the guerrilla if not a criminal ? " demands the canh sat commander , Colonel Pham Van Lieu . " He commits all the possible crimes-murder and rape , grand larceny and petty theft , extortion and blackmail . " <P> Lieu 's definition is unarguable-and so are the results his men are getting . In one recent week they seized 54 tons of foodstuffs destined for the Viet Cong , 31,290 items of equipment and 1,436 of medicine-plus 340 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killed 54 guerrillas . In the process they lost only one canh sat-a ratio of effectiveness that if equaled by the regular armies for only a few weeks , would soon end the war . They are fast winning deep respect from their U.S. allies and from enemy terrorists . <P> After Diem . Even the South Vietnamese populace is impressed-no mean feat , considering the fact that for years the police had been little more than pawns in Saigon 's political chess games . President Diem turned them into a family guard and on occasion played them off against the army . He created a subdivision known as the " combat police " that he used to raid pagodas during the feud with the Buddhists that ultimately led to his downfall . After Diem 's government was overthrown , the canh sat were so demoralized that the Americans often called them " the white mice " because of their timidity . <P> Timid no more . A year ago last May , Saigon and the U.S. decided to build up the national police so that they could carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Malaya : Resource Control . In plain terms , their function is to deny guerrillas food , medicine and supplies . Pham Van Lieu , a crack former marine commando , was brought in to restore discipline and esprit and to try to mend fences with the regular military . The number of canh sat was doubled from 22,000 to the present 53,000 , will total 72,000 by 1967-many of them trained by 144 U.S. policemen imported by AID 's Public Safety Division . Eventually , the number may grow to 100,000 - enough to move in behind combat troops once an area is cleared of Viet <P> Cong and form a permanent , local pacification force . <P> Off With Whites . Meanwhile the canh sat . ring Saigon with checkpoints on all major highways and waterways . Mobile units on Jeeps set up random roadblocks to keep the Viet Cong 's messengers and supply carriers off balance . Other police teams constantly circulate through Saigon in family census sweeps , checking the identity cards that all South Vietnamese over 18 are required to carry .
