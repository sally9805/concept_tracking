txt Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz said today that a compulsory solution to the rail- ! road work-rules dispute would threaten the institution of col- : lective bargaining . " A failure of responsibility " by both management and labor is forcing the dispute toward such a solution , the Secretary said in an interview on " Sunday Report , " a National Broadcasting Company television program . " There is no affirmative attempt by either side in this situation to do anything about settling it even at this late hour , " Mr. Wirtz said . Deliberations will be started tomorrow by a six-man subcommittee that President Kennedy named last week in a move that postponed a threatened strike by five train-operating unions . The panel will lay the basis for a report , due Friday , on which the Administration is expected to base a request for legislation to end the four-yearold dispute . President Kennedy has said he will make his recommendations to Congress I July 22 , Both sides have agreed to delay a strike deadline until July 29 . The railroads have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in work rules that will allow them to eliminate thou ' sands of jobs they consider unnecessary . The unions have said they would strike . if this were done . Mr , Wirtz said the deadlock proved " that collective bargaininr in this industry was n't ready for this particular problem . " Over the years , the railroads and the unions have permitted an accumulation of these rules , which the carriers say cost them $600,000,000 a year , Mr , Wirtz said . When automation made its impact , the industry " was n't prepared for it by way of bargaining habits or tradition , " he said . " I hope it can be made dead clear that collective bargaining as a whole is functioning so well today , except in some parts of the transportation industry and in a few other narrow areas , that there is .0 , responsibility in this case to see that the rest , cd collective bar-. gaining is not weakened , " he said . Meanwhile , Senators Jacob K. Javits , Republican of New York , and Wayne Morse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation that would require compulsory arbitration in ' the dispute . Senator Javits , in a statement recorded on tape for television broadcast in New York City and Buffalo , . said : " The country again is caught unprepared by a crisis like this because the Administration and the Congress have been unwilling to face the hard realities of the needed labor-mai agement legislation . " " The Administration has gahe in for improvisation and grandplays of one kind or another to pull out of difficult situations , " he said . In an interview on " Washington Report , " a Columbia Broadcasting System television program , Senator Morse said , " The Administration could n't possibly get a compulsory arbitration bill through unless the pub lic interest became seriously damaged . " " I am just as opposed to nationalization as I. am to corn- ' pulsory arbitration , " he said . Mr. Wirtz refused to say whether the Administration would call for compulsory arbitration of the dispute .
