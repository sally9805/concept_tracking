It was an old record , the needle stuck in a groove , stuttering the same strident chords , assailing ears that had grown weary of the tune . Going into its second month , New York 's newspaper strike had turned into something of a bore . Manhattan readers grazed on a new crop of strike-born dailies , none of which served as a satisfactory substitute for the missing newspapers . In their separate camps , the publishers and the striking printers hibernated like bears waiting for spring . <P> Severe Handicap . But if the strike was a bore , it was also a painfully expensive one . The American Newspaper Guild ran out of money and had to borrow $300,000 from the A.F.L.-C.I.O . New York Local 6 of the International Typographical Union slapped a $3 weekly assessment on all 6,000 of its working members-those employed by commercial print shops and therefore unaffected by the strike . New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen Local 2 hopefully brought suit against the New York Post , the Herald Tribune and the Mirror , asking $72,000 in lost pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck but had closed down when the I.T.U. struck the other four dailies , the union claimed that the pressmen had been unlawfully deprived of their jobs . For the 900 New York Timesmen still at work in the U.S. and abroad , Publisher Orvil Dryfoos ordered pay cuts ranging from 20% ( for salaries under $15,000 ) to 50% ( over $15,000 ) . <P> Such measures promised only to extend a shutdown that had already lasted scandalously long . The most impressive agency actively seeking a solution to the strike was an ad hoc board with no power whatsoever . This was the Board of Public Accountability , a panel of three judges-Harold R. Medina , Joseph O'Grady , David W. Peck-appointed by U.S. Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz last week to hear witnesses from both sides . I.T.U. <P> Local President Bertram A. Powers , whose men instigated the strike , stubbornly boycotted the board , but just about everybody else showed up to speak his piece . <P> For a few hopeful moments , it seemed that the judges might have catalyzed a break in the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said John Harold , attorney for the Pressmen 's Unit ; he confided to the panel that his union 's membership was " close to a settlement . " The judges promptly recessed to let the pressmen and the publishers come together in negotiations that went on all night . But this produced only an objection by Bert Powers . " A severe handicap , " said he . " It puts us in a disadvantageous position to have a second union negotiating while we 're negotiating . " <P> After three days of testimony , the judges reached their conclusion . Although Federal Judge Harold Medina , * 74 , fiery chairman of the panel , might have preferred stronger language , the panel left no doubt about whom it held accountable . <P> That man was Bert Powers . The strike , said the judges ' report , was " a deliberate design " to " postpone any negotiation until a time when the publishers would be forced to surrender under the economic pressure of threatened extinction .
