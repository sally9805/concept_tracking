With all the world talking about the urgent importance of granting economic aid to developing countries , the quiet man off in the corner has been the Federal Republic of West Germany . West German gold and foreign-exchange reserves have shot up to a whacking $6.5 billion ( British holdings : $2.8 billion ) , and West German exports now top those of every other European country . Yet since 1956 the Germans have spent just $60 million altogether in technical aid . Last week when the nine-nation Development Assistance Group met in Bonn , the U.S. 's Assistant Secretary of the Treasury T. Graydon Upton bluntly told his German hosts that it was time that West Germany shouldered a full share of foreign aid . <P> The Germans had been expecting the blast . A few days before the meeting , the government introduced a new $500 million , five-year aid plan , largely drawn from counterpart funds set up as part of the Marshall Plan aid . Said Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard : " The German people should not forget that after their country 's collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall be prepared to recognize our obligations and make a deliberate sacrifice to help other peoples . " Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano added that " development policy must be given equal status with our Eastern policy and our European policy . " Said Socialist Deputy Heinrich Deist : " We , in our economic wonderland with its booming business , should be ashamed of the fact that we are still using the revenues of American Marshall Plan aid for internal purposes . A courageous decision is necessary . " <P> A more far-reaching plan is to levy a special tax , the proceeds of which would be earmarked for an aid program . But as a German delegate hastily explained to his Development Assistance Group colleagues , this is a pre-election year in West Germany- " a bad time for burdening the German public with new taxes .
