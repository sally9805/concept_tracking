" THE document that inspired the convocation is one of the great encyclicals of the century . Unusually long for a papal pronouncement-more than 15,000 words-Pacem in Terris was issued by John XXIII on April 11 , 1963 , less than two months before his death . It was the last of his eight encyclicals , the first in history addressed not only to the bishops and laity of the Roman Catholic Church but to " all men of good will . " <P> What the Pope said to the world is not in itself radical or revolution ary ; many of the ideas put forward by John had been articulated by his predecessor Pius XII . What gave these ideas freshness and new life is the warm , open Johannine spirit-the willingness to reach beyond the frontiers of Catholic doctrine and bring the church into dialogue with the modern world . Perhaps more important , they were ideas whose time had come round at last . The encyclical appeared in a season of relaxing world tensions and at the moment in history when the Christian churches had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights &; Duties . Pacem in Terris methodically progressed from a discussion of the rights and duties of individual men to the relations of state with state . These relations , argued the Pope , must be based on truth , justice , love and , above all , freedom . Specifically , he condemned racial discrimination , strongly affirmed the right of religious liberty , and passionately deplored the arms race . <P> <P> Pope John addressed atheists as well as believers ; yet Pacem in Terris is an unmistakably theistic work . This is hardly surprising in a papal pronouncement , but it clearly sets the encyclical apart from such purely secular documents as the United Nations ' Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Time and again , Pope John argues that the rights of men and governments stem not solely from human consent but from the design of the Creator . <P> How is God 's design to be known ? In answer , Pope John turned to a cherished concept of Catholic philosophy : natural law-man 's instinctive but God-given knowledge of right and wrong . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has the right to life , education , private property and has the duty to cooperate with others in building an orderly world . Today , said the Pope , the moral order demanded by natural law also requires a supranational public authority-a world government . <P> Concise &; Limpid . Natural law dictates the relationship between men and nations . But these relation ships must be ratified and established by human law , and Pope John applauded that fundamental of Western democracy , government by constitution . Rejecting government by coercion , the Pope endorsed the explicit definition of the rights and duties of governments and citizens in every nation 's basic law , including a charter of fundamental human rights written " in concise and limpid phraseology.
