Haunted by those pictures of starving children , their eyes bulging , their bodies bloated or matchstick thin , most Americans ask indignantly : Why has the U.S. not done more to relieve such suffering ? The answer , of course , is that starvation has been a calculated weapon in the civil war between federal Nigeria and secessionist Biafra . The Nigerians are fearful that arms will flow into Biafra under the cover of relief shipments and therefore insist that aid be shipped in under their supervision . The Biafrans reject such terms because they fear foul play by the federals . The U.S. has been distressed by the Biafrans ' plight , but it wants to see Nigeria survive as a unified nation ; so Washington has hung back from overt aid . U.S. Government relief-$17 million to date-has been channeled through private and religious organizations . <P> But in recent weeks Washington 's attitude has altered . Alarmed by the possibility of a vast famine that could kill thousands of Biafra 's 7,000,000 people in the next three months , the Administration has decided on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million more in relief into Biafra by the end of the fiscal year . <P> Last week the U.S. announced it was making available to a consortium of church relief groups four giant C-97 Stratofreighter cargo planes , and another four to the International Red Cross . The relief groups will get the aircraft-each capable of hauling 18 tons of cargo-at the bargain price of about $4,000 apiece , with the proviso that the planes are to be used exclusively for shipment of food and medical supplies to noncombatants . The decision to make the planes available was the result of pleas by a number of private individuals and church organizations . Also crucial was Senator Edward Kennedy 's active lobbying with the State Department on behalf of stepped-up relief measures . <P> Greater Pressure . While U.S. officials insist that offer of the planes does not constitute a major change in policy , the move seems certain to increase U.S. pressure on the warring sides for a peaceful settlement . It will also be a spur to other nations to contribute more relief and reduce arms shipments to Nigeria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projection that , if mass famine is to be averted , Biafra should be receiving 40,000 to 50,000 tons of food a month . Only an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tons now reach the territory via a clandestine nighttime airlift sponsored by relief organizations . <P> The new famine threat-unlike kwashiorkor , the debilitating protein deficiency that threatened Biafra earlier this year-stems from a shortage of carbohydrate staples such as yams . The Biafran government is attempting to prevent the worst by urging farmers to plant more rice , but the outlook is grim . " The stocks will be gone by January , " says an aide to Lieut . Colonel Odu-megwu Ojukwu , Biafra 's leader . " There is nothing to plant and nothing to eat in the lean months from May to September . Nor will there be a harvest next September .
