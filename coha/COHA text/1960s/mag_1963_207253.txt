MARKETING &; SELLING <P> Americans drink 80% of the world 's whisky , and the slightest change in their drinking tastes is anxiously watched by the $6 billion U.S. liquor industry . For some time now , the industry has been adjusting to the public shift toward something called lightness-a combination of smoother flavor , lower alcoholic strength and lighter color . The most dramatic and expensive response to this trend has just been made by Seagrams , the world 's biggest distiller . Seagrams is retiring its high-selling ( $50 million a year ) Calvert Reserve and replacing it with a lighter blend of 50 whiskies and aged spirits called Calvert Extra . <P> Seagrams Vice President Edgar Miles Bronfman , 33 , son of the company 's Canadian founder and president , credits the switch to lightness to the influence of women , who prefer drinks without a lingering taste , and of young people , who find the " lights " easier to learn on . " Basically , " argues Chairman John Martin of Heublein , which specializes in vodka ( Smirnoff ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alcohol-it 's too strong for them . " Slightly more than half of the liquor Americans drink is still considered heavy by the new standards-such as bourbons and most blends-but a dozen years ago the " heavies " accounted for more than 80% of sales . Some bourbon distillers are selling more of their reduced proof ( 86 ) than of their heavier 100 proof . <P> Distillers get lightness primarily by using more neutral spirits ( grain alcohol ) , which contain no flavoring congeners , then lowering the proof with distilled water . U.S. distillers are at a disadvantage because federal law limits the amount of neutral spirits they may use in blends , while distillers of Scotch and Canadian have no limits . U.S. blends usually have 65% neutral spirits ; Scotch and Canadian usually have 70% . Thanks to the trend to lightness , U.S. sales of Scotch have more than doubled in a decade to 9% of the market ( most popular : Cutty Sark and J &; B , two of the lightest blends ) , and light Canadian blends now account for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V.O. and Hiram Walker 's Canadian Club ) . The market share of such high-spirited " white goods " as gin and vodka has jumped from 9% to 19% since 1952 . <P> Almost all major U.S. distillers are now following the light . Schenley has expanded its Long John Distilleries in Scotland , and National Distillers will soon start importing an extralight Scotch . Kentucky 's Brown-Forman has diversified from its heavy commitment to bourbons by importing Green Stripe Scotch and acquiring the U.S. rights to Amsterdam 's <P> Bols vodka . Several U.S. distillers have already begun to market light whisky blends of only 80 proof , and Barton Distilling Vice President Ralph Ettlinger predicts : " Most of the whisky sold in the future will be 80 proof .
