The Capitol Police Department , charged with protecting the House and Senate buildings , boasts some of the world 's best-educated cops-and some of the least efficient . More than half of the 248-man force consists of meagerly trained , patronage-appointed college students whose ambitions seldom em brace advancement in the gendarmerie ( the annual turnover is 82% ) .

Inevitably , the incident revived memories of the day in 1954 when four Puerto Rican nationalists gunned down five House members , and brought calls from Congressmen for a professional force . Protested Representative Paul Findley ( R. , Ill . ) : " No self-respecting village in America would put up with this so-called security system . "
