After watching the contenders on TV , Paris ' Le Monde dubbed President Charles de Gaulle the " champion in all weight classes without challenger . " <P> The bout in question was this week 's referendum to decide whether future French Presidents are to be elected by direct vote . De Gaulle 's opponents were operating under handicaps . The crisis in Cuba has reinforced the French tendency to rally behind a strong leader . Said De Gaulle pointedly : " In our world , which is so dangerous-one sees it now at this very moment-France can not survive if she falls back into the impotence of yesterday . " Many voters are likely to agree . Further , the government-controlled radio-TV network , which plugged the Gaullist line even in news broadcasts , limited each opposition speaker to ten minutes , and a sternly ticking time clock was shown before the speaker began and when he had ended . The performances were enough to drive a televiewer into the kitchen for another shot of cognac-if he did not switch off the set entirely . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing metal-rimmed spectacles and a funereal suit , warned of the evils of Gaullist capitalism and of the military alliance with " vengeful " West Germany . Senate President Gaston Monnerville , a Negro born in French Guiana , spoke in the name of the Radical Party , argued legalistically that De Gaulle had violated the constitution and that his resignation threat , if he did not get an impressive yes vote , changed the referendum from a " consultation to a summons . " <P> As the referendum day approached , the opposition hardened . Ex-President Vincent Auriol now openly accused De Gaulle of " usurpation " and of asking the nation to " legalize his coups d'etat . " Economic Planner Etienne Hirsch blasted De Gaulle by asking if the man who wanted to be the " supreme guide " of France had " forgotten how this translates into Italian , Spanish or German " - il Duce , el Caudillo , der Fuhrer . Opposition posters quoted the words of the late Premier Georges Clemenceau : " The cemeteries are full of indispensable men . " <P> As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin than he had hoped for . He drew just under 62% of all valid ballots , but only 47% of registered voters - less than in previous referendums .
