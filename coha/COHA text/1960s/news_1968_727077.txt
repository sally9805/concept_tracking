txt Like the many antiwar protests that continue across the United States , " peace now " was the goal of a demonstration at the Carnegie Endowment Building in United Nations Plaza last spring . A year later , the peace movement has grown to include more than 1,000 organizations , and this week announced plans for more and larger demonstrations . Antiwar rallies escalate across U.S. Thousands of demonstrators in cities across the United States and abroad are preparing to take part in a new series of antiwar rallies this weekend . Following is the first of two reports offering a close look at antiwar protesters and what they stand for . The antiwar movement presses on . The enthusiastic receptions across the nation for current peace-conference prospects , for the standpoints of Sens . Eugene J. McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy , both sharp critics of the Vietnam war , show this . But there are other indications : ? Antiwar groups are blossoming like spring flowers . There are well over 1,000 organizations protesting the war today , according to a survey by this writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . Likely to give added impetus to the peace movement is disclosure this week by Lewis B. Hershey , selective-service director , of an estimate that up to 100,000 more men than originally scheduled may be drafted in the 12 months starting July 1 ? " if the war does n't get over , " as he put it . He said as many as 340,000 men may be called up during the next fiscal year . ? There are at least 28,000 hard-core activists within these groups . Most are members of several antiwar organizations . ? In addition , there are tens of thousands of Americans who support these groups by signing petitions , writing their congressmen , picketing , attending meetings and rallies , or working for peace candidates . ? For the most part , these persons are not hippies , perennial protesters , Communists , or even just pacifists . They are housewives , business executives , above-average students , laborers .

But these thousands of new protesters ? those who have made the peace movement " respectable " this past year  --  object to the war for one basic reason : They totally reject the Johnson administration 's domino theory . That is , if South Vietnam falls to communism , the rest of Southeast Asia would soon collapse . They reject this theory because they doubt that the intent of the major Communist nations is " expansion and extension of Communist domination , " as reiterated by Secretary of State Dean Rusk during the recent Senate foreign-relations hearings . Thus , to these war protesters the United States is the aggressor in Vietnam ; the war is immoral ; the use of such weapons as napalm is therefore inhumane ; and our fighting is actually driving South Vietnamese into communism as a way out of war . Small groups forming ? Much of the protest has been found on America 's campuses . Off campus , protest centers in the major cities . But now small antiwar groups are forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the South or in the conservative suburbs of large cities . ? Most Americans protesting this war appear to be well dressed , conscientious , fully convinced of the immorality of the war , and commited to the point that they risk constant and bitter verbal attack from their neighbors and fellow workers . " We believe there is far more of a groundswell for peace than meets the eye , or is organized , or deserves the " nik " or " hip " labels . . . , " says the Rev. Christian H. Kehl of the San Antonio ( Texas ) Committee to Stop the War in Vietnam . Generally , the protesters are zealous amateurs . Even here on the University of Iowa campus , one of the more publicized protest centers , the 25 or 30 radical , leftist-leaning activists admit their tactics often have been " badly conceived . " UneXpected happens Their protests have moved in recent months from picketing to civil disobedience , and that has brought violence , arrests , suspensions of students and professors , and not many converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these war protesters do n't always anticipate the results of their actions and then plan accordingly . If they did they , like like early , civil-rights leaders , might better control the entire protest and put their efforts to maximum benefit . There have been protests on the University of Iowa campus for three years , and many students express discouragement at failing to stop the Vietnam war . Even so , they continue to picket , sit in , raise thousands of dollars for bailing students out of jail , . distribute antiwar literature , and form new antiwar groups . At present in Iowa City , there are two Graft-resistance groups , a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society , a Citizens Committee against the war , a Committee of Concerned Faculty , a Student Bail Fund , the Hawkeye Student Party ( a leftist student party which runs candidates for student offices ) , and Iowa Vets for Peace .

" At the University of Iowa , student protesters poured blood on steps of buildings . At Oberlin College 300 students trapped a Navy recruiter in his car for four hours , and it took helmeted police , tear gas , and fire hoses to break them up . Most students who seriously protest the war on campus are found to make " As " and " Bs , " are extremely well read in the leading antiwar literature , and are articulate . For the rest , war protest at college is a wonderful outlet to vent their idealism about what America should be like . " Our activities on campus are causing more and more students and faculty to ask meaningful questions about our society , " says one Midwest student protester .
