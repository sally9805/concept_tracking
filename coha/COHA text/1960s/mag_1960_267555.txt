There is one fact on the U.S. domestic scene that both Republican and Democratic presidential hopefuls agree upon : Ezra Taft Benson 's farm program has resulted in one big mess . But where Democrats have a wide field for criticism of Administration policies , front-running Republican Richard Nixon is on a ledge : so long as he is a member of the Eisenhower team , he can not risk a serious party split by taking out after Agriculture Secretary Benson . Last week Dick Nixon told a group of farm-state Congressmen of a politically momentous decision : he intends to cut himself off from the Administration 's agriculture record later this summer by presenting his own farm program-despite Ezra Benson 's own recent statements that he had Nixon 's support . <P> The news leaked out after Nixon met in his office with Iowa 's five Republican Congressmen-Ben Jensen , Charles Hoeven , Fred Schwengel , H. R. Gross and John Kyl. * The lowans , who sought the meeting to measure Nixon 's stand on farm policies , blasted Ezra Benson , cited the painful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which in 1959 sank no less than 16% or $2.1 billion from 1958 ) . They warned Nixon that the Democrats would probably pass a wild cornucopia of a farm bill that Ike would have to veto . The political consequences in farm country , they said , were easy to foretell : the Democrats could then declare that the Administration was doing its best to ruin the farmer . <P> As the lowans talked on , Nixon listened intently while his campaign adviser , onetime G.O.P. National Chairman LenHall , sat beaming . Said Nixon at last : " My father was born in Ohio and my mother was born in Indiana , and they were farm people . I think I know how a farmer feels . " Then he said , referring to the failures of the Administration farm program , " If you only knew how I 've suffered in this . I know what you fellows out there have been up against . But I 'm on a team , and I 've got to either stay on the team or get off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had already begun naming an informal fact-finding committee whose members will tour the farm areas and collect on-the-spot facts , figures and information on attitudes to help him formulate a workable program . Such a program , he said , will be ready for a campaign plank after the Republican Convention , and hopefully it will be a good one , so that neither he nor G.O.P. Congressmen will have to run on Ezra Benson 's record . Nixon added that he plans a hard campaign through the Middle West and particularly in towns under 10,000 population , where he can talk to farmers . Said Ben Jensen : " Nick , * you will honor every small town in America if you do that . That 's where America lives . " <P> After that the lowans left , confident that Nixon 's loyalty to the Administration will not interfere with reality . <P> <P> *Elected at a special election last December despite heavy attack on Benson by his Democratic opponent ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) . <P> *A nickname still used by friends who got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
