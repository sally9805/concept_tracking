txt F Governor Rockefeller , disturbed that Federal aid has been bypassing Albany on its way to local areas , set up a special cabinet committee yesterday to look into Federal-state relations . " Congress , " he said , " has sanctioned increasing Federal intervention in matters that traditionally have been the responsibility of state and local governments . " The Governor is particularly concerned , a spokesman said , over Washington 's growing tendency to deal directly with municipalities , organizations and individuals in the anti- , poverty program . Mr. Rockefeller named his executive assistant and cousin , Alexander Aldrich , to head the special committee and gave the group the following assignment:1 C " The exploration of areas in which recent and pending ; legislation bypasses or dupli cates existing state machinery , thereby resulting in waste and disorder . C " The improvement of coordination between Federal . and state governments . c " The development of ways to strengthen further the . Fed-1 eral system as an important and vital force in American ! life . " Clash at Hudson Hearing A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clash at a Congressional subcommittee hearing in Yonkers last July 24 over the future of the Hudson River . Conrad L. Wirth , executive director of the Governor 's Hudson River Valley Commission , insisted at the hearing that , there was no need for Federal ' intervention in preserving what remained of the river 's beauty. ! He argued that the commission , comprising New York State res-i idents , was doing an adequate job . But critics of the Governor ; complained that his administration had done nothing to arrest the " spoliation " of tho river . One of them , Representative Richard L. Ottinger , Democrat of Westchester , sponsored a for the creation of a national park to be called the Hudson Highlands Scenic Rivemay . The Governor , on June 5 , called on the Legislature to support him in a vast conservation program for the Hudson valley area . In his appeal , Mr. Rockefeller asserted that there was " no place here , and certainly no need , for the Federal Government , as has been suggested , to isolate the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or our people . " 1 Mr. Aldrich said yesterday that he would begin meeting individually with the 16 other members of the committee next lweek . " Our first job will be to develop a system of priorities , " he said . Asked when a report might be forthcoming , he said ' no deadline had been set . " The sooner the better , especially in the areas where the Legislature will have to act , " ? Mr. Aldrich said . " Congress has created new social-welfare programs that the state has to implement . " The chairman predicted that the committee would issue a number of reports and that the subject of social welfare might get first attention . Other retorts , he said , might deal with education , health and mental health , the antipoverty program , and possibly the arts . Mr. Aldrich noted that he had been concerned with problems of Federal-state relations as chairman of a special cabinet committee for civil rights and as chairman of a cabinet committee to coordinate the Federal Economic Opportunity Program . Governor Rockefeller discussed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lectures at Harvard University in 1962 . " The national Government , " he said then , " is too remote to sense and to act responsively on the widely varying local or regional concerns and aspirations . The states  --  through their relations with local governments , their greater resources and powers , and their closeness to the people and the problems ? can and should serve as the leaders in planning and the catalysts in developing cooper ative action at local-state-Federal levels . " At another point in the let-1 ture series , the Governor re " The local governments have no ' sovereignty ' to counterbalance Federal sovereignty , nor the fiscal power to resist its blandishments . And this is a fact to be kept in mind when considering Federal legislation in the areas of housing , social reform , urban renewal and the like , particularly if that legislation is designed to bypass the states . " In yesterday 's announcement Mr. Rockefeller echoed that theme .
