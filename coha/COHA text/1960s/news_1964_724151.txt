txt New York There is a group of people in this country who will gladly sell you an interest in a hoard of $21 billion of gold . Do n't buy ! The gold does n't exist . The men are operating a confidence racket . Treasury secret service men have their eye on them . But it will be up to state police to act . A year or so back , operators of such bunco games used small gold bars as the bait for " suckers . " Treasury agents soon hauled some of them into court . Under federal law it is illegal to hoard gold in the form of bars . Today such " con men " use placer gold  --  gold in its natural state . It is legal to hold such gold . Thus these confidence men avoid intervention by the Treasury agents . Noblest Metal ' This tale shows that there are still some modern-day " alchemists " whose greed leads them to believe they can turn relatively few dollars into mountains of gold . There are millions of others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust paper money as a store of wealth . This is particularly true in other parts of the world where rampant inflation has wiped out the value di various currencies . Many a European can recall seeing his savings completely disappear twice in the financial anarchy surrounding the world wars . Even the advanced industrialized nations of the Western World still prefer to hold most of their monetary reserves in gold , rather than paper money . In fact these nations are much concerned with gold hoarding . It deprives them of gold which might be added to their monetary stores of gold . To the metallurgist , gold is simply a metal with extraordinary resistance to corroding influences . Thus it is sometimes called the " noblest metal . " Indeed , it is likely that some gold stored in the deep vaults here of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was first dug from the ground by members of ancient civilizations . To the central banker , gold is money . It is a vital portion of " international liquidity "  --  the store of gold and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of payments . Central bankers want to be sure that the supply of international liquidity is just about " right . " Liquidity Studied If there is ton much liquidity , politicians will have less incentive to restrain the forces of inflation in their nations . If there is too little , international trade will be hampered . The supply of gold becomes an essential factor in this question of liquidity . Ten nations representing the Western World 's principal currencies , known as the Group of Ten , last year launched a study of international liquidity . So did the International Monetary Fund . Both of their reports arc to be released Monday . Both will deal with gold as well as other aspects of liquidity . // Gold Bars Used as ' Bait ' // Last year the world production of gold , excluding the Communist nations , was worth approximately $1.36 billlion . It rose by nearly 5 percent from 1962 . In fact gold production has been rising for a decade . ' Output Boosted Gold production last year was 8 percent above 1940 when output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devaluations of the 1930 's . The increase last year reflects a boost in South African production by about 7.5 percent to 27,400,000 ounces or $971 million. , It represents approximately 70.6 percent of world production . With new mines opening and improved techniques , South African gold production is expected to continue to increase slightly in the next few years . South Africa 's gold is an element of financial strength that those seeking to change that nation 's policy of apartheid through economic pressures must not forget , observers note . Production also increased a little in Ghana , Japan , Mexico , and Southern Rhodesia . Peak Was in 1940 But in Canada , second only to South Africa in the Western World , output declined further to $139 million in United States money from $145 million in 1962 . Production also dropped in the United States to about $53 million . The peak production year in this country was 1940 when output reached 4,900,000 ounces or $170 million . Russia 's gold production remains blanketed in secrecy . Most estimates of Soviet annual production vary from between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cstimated at between $1.95 billion and $7 billion . Franz Pick , a New York economist who turns out reports on money and calls himself a " currency analyst , " is more generous . He estimates annual production at $600 million and reserves at $8 billion.1 More is known about Soviet gold sales to the West . Soviet Sales Listed These were about $550 million last year , compared with sales of only $215 million in 1962 . The Russians used the gold to pay for their enormous wheat purchases in Australia , Canada , France , Western Germany . and the United States . It is estimated that the Russians have disposed of another $325 million of gold in the West this year . Over the last 10 years , Russian exports of gold amount to about $3.5 billion , according to Mr. Pick . This has been a substantial contribution to the Western gold supply . It may be increased in the future . The Soviets have announced a drive to increase gold output and to reduce production costs . Economists here point out with some sly mirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as conservative and orthodox as the most traditional of Western states . Reirni Crmmer Last year the Soviets opened a branch of their London bank in Beirut , the location of a major gold market . They hoped to take advantage of a price about 20 cents higher per ounce than in the London gold market . They found one difficulty , however , reports Mr. Pick . They tried to sell 400-ounce gold bars  --  a standard size in the West . But in Beirut the normal size is a " 10 tola bar " ? slightly different . From Beirut the gold Is distributed , chiefly through Kuwait , to the Middle East and India and Pakistan . It is largely smuggled and ends up in private hoards , Mr. Pick says . With the extra-large Soviet gold sales , the monetary authorities of the world last year added about $855 million to their gold stocks . It is the largest accretion in the last 15 years . ? rivate Hoardings ? This compares with $325 million in 1962 , $600 million in 1961 , and $310 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.91 billion of fresh supplies . The difference was absorbed by private hoarders and industry or the arts . Miroslav A. Kriz , economist . at the First National City Bank of New York , figures private hoardings last year came to about $1 billion . This amount , Mr. Kriz estimates , may be $100 million or $200 million less than the year before . Here Mr. Pick disagrees . He holds that gold hoarding " has gone up , up , and up and never declined . The higher gross national product goes up , the more gold goes into hoarding . " In any event , gold hoarding is a normal means of saving in the Middle and Far East . In Europe and Latin America it is regarded as protection against long-run political and economic uncertainties . Totals Reckoned Since the end of World War II approximately $15 billion of gold has been diverted from official holdings to other uses . Mr. Pick estimates world gold hoardings by October of this year will be about $17 billion . Of this , S4.4 billion , he figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of Europe . Asians hide away some $3.8 billion to $4 billion . African hoards come to $1.75 billion . And those in the Americas to $2.6 billion , Mr. Pick reckons . Americans , of course , are not allowed to hold gold in monetary form , except for coins of recognized numismatic value minted before April 5 , 1933 , or placer gold . How much gold is held illegally in the country is an unknown quantity . Treasury officials believe it to be a small amount . ( First of a series )
