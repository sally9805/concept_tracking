The Lion in Winter , by James Goldman , uncages a good roaring lion ( Robert Preston ) and a fearsomely impressive lioness ( Rosemary Harris ) , but they spend the evening toying with a tiny blind mouse of a script . <P> Since Henry II could not possibly recognize himself or his brood in Goldmancolor , the playgoer should not strive to do so . Winter is rather a day in the life of that boisterous Plantagenet family in the little 12th century castle halfway down the next block . It is Christmas Eve , and a spat is in progress . That is what the play is , an interminable family spat . The three boys , or brats , want Daddy 's crown , and they sulk and scream over it as if it were the prize in the Cracker Jack box . Daddy wants Mommy 's booming piece of real estate - Aquitaine . <P> What Mommy wants is to be one up on Daddy-always . Of course , Daddy can be trying . He keeps a lemon-blonde lollipop of a mistress around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Mommy . Since they are all unloving and unloved , no one is hurt . But the pomposities of the dialogue can be pretty wounding : " The sky is pocked with stars , " " I 've spent two years on every street in hell . " <P> Robert Preston takes on this child 's play with small range but fierce unrelenting intensity . Rosemary Harris-whether melting , mocking or Medean-proves once again that she is one of the two or three most formidable actresses on the American stage . Too bad she got stuck in a Plantagenutty play .
