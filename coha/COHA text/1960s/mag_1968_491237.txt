In early summer four ; young men set out to climb the face of an obscure and dangerous mountain peak in Alaska . In this eloquent account , a member of that expedition tells the story of their ordeal : the 40 Clays ' struggle against ice , snow and treacherous weather ; the fight to overcome their own fear ; the successful conquest of the summit ; and the price the mountain exacted in return  --  the life of one Man . After two days the clouds lifted from the range in the evening . Sheldon told us to be ready at 4 A.M. the next morning , when he 'd fly us in to get the best possible snow conditions for landing . As we went to sleep , I felt restless , with a mixture of excitement and anxiety . After to  --  morrow the mountain would loom in our skies and lives , not just in our dreams ; after tomorrow there would be no turning back until we had climbed Huntington or clearly failed . I knew there would be dangerous situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we would come out of it all right . Not in my gloomiest imaginings would I have foreseen that one of us would be killed , would fall to an icy grave so remote that no one would ever find his body . In the morning Sheldon woke us with , " Let 's get a move on , she 's a fine one . " Matt and I quickly dressed , dumped our gear in Sheldon 's Cessna , and put on our down jackets , despite the 70-degree weather , for we would step out of the plane in a cold glacial corridor at 9,000 feet . Sheldon started the engine , and we sputtered down the rocky runway . Eighty miles away the Alaska Range stuck into the faultless sky , differentiable only as three white masses : McKinley , Hunter and Foraker . There was nothing else to fasten our attention on for the first 15 minutes , except the trackless tundra beneath us , threaded by silver rivers that all wound their ways outward , like snakes escaping the mountains that spawned them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its summit visible above a thin cloud layer . Its separation from the mountains near it seemed to increase ; as we passed over the snout of the glacier , Huntington was suddenly silhouetted against the sky . It seemed astonishingly sharp . Then the clouds broke and we were right in the gorge of the Tokositna . We spiraled lower and lower . Finally Sheldon said , " OK . We 're taking her in . " I still could n't tell where the snow was , whether it was 50 feet below or 500 . Then a wall of white  --  ness seemed to leap in front of the plane . Sheldon pulled back on the stick ; the stall warning screamed ; we topped the rise and landed in one motion . I opened the door and jumped out ; the snow was crisp and solid . Matt threw our stuff out ; then he stood clear , and Sheldon took off down the glacier to get Ed and Don . We saw him round the bend , a dot now against the surrounding walls . Then even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there alone . 1968 by ibsotid S. Roberts , from the book . Mountam nt My Foe , to be pubhshed by Vanguard press .

We were I , u tip its northwest branch . much closer to Mane , th Huntington . Steep avalanche slopes wailed : 1 precipitous basin ; at the other end of it , live away , was our west face . Suddenly we heard the plane 's buzz again . and Sheldon flew into sight around the bend in the glacier . He landed perfectly . Ed stepped out of the plane with a raucous whoop and pulled a remark  --  able pile of rope and food boxes out of the plane . In a few moments Sheldon was off again . With Ed we moved our supplies nearer the center of the glacier. in case the avalanches had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back with Don and the last of our equipment . At last . after months of planning and anticipation . the four of us were alone with our mountain . Mount Huntington has often been described as the most beautiful mountain in Alaska . For the 61 ) years that men have known about it . it has pos  --  sessed a quality common to only a few mountains in the world  --  a sense of arrested grace , perhaps ; a sculptured frailty too savage for any sculptor 's hand ; a kinship with the air around it that makes it always seem in motion . In 1964 Don Jensen and I had spent 42 days failing to climb a very difficult ridge on Alaska 's Mount Deborah , a mountain almost the same height as Huntington t 12,240 feet ) and in many spectacular respects similar . After a period of re  --  covering from the strain we had put on each other 's nerves , we decided in December that we wanted to climb together again in Alaska the next summer . This time we decided on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of 1964 , by a French expedition led by Lionel Terray , perhaps the greatest expedition mountaineer who ever lived . His party had climbed via the north ridge , which seemed , indeed , the only reasonable route . After a good deal of study . though , Don and I had decided that we could attempt the west face , a wall of sheer rock with one barely protruding rib that ran straight to the summit . No one had ever climbed a real face in Alaska ; nearly all of them are too dangerous . We admitted to each other that there was certainly less than an even chance of success . Yet a gallant failure , a failure on the sort of route that had never been done , seemed more valuable to us than just another " good route , " following in some past expedition 's footsteps . Don had been at Harvard with me , but had dropped out and was now living in California . Dur  --  ing our cross-country planning , we agreed that a four-man expedition would be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . Matt , a junior at Harvard . had never been on an expedition before , but he was obviously ready for one . Learning to climb . for him . had always been easy , though he started late . Don and I had been brought up on hikes in our native California and Colorado ; but Matt , living in Virginia . had little or no exposure to big mountains before college . He had learned virtually all his skills with the Harvard Mountaineering Club . But he was good . Matt was attracted to Huntington. but seemed wary of Don 's wild enthusiasm . especially in the face of a very doubtful success . It took longer to infect him with the excitement of the plan . Yet one might well wonder why we should ask that kind of involvement  --  indeed , how was it pos  --  sible for us to feel it ? Climbing of the sort we were preparing for , a four-man party alone for two months in the most rugged mountains in North America . requires if not a fundamental loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with  --  out most of the other people in the world . Don . and I had found we could enjoy long periods of self-sufficiency in the mountains ; if we grew to miss a lot of civilization 's comforts , their appeal never equaled the taut excitement of the way of life we could lead on expeditions . But , although I could rationalize it , I never understood the in  --  lensit y of my feeling for Alaska . If I understood 0 , though , perhaps I would n't care enough about it to want to explain it . Nor does all this explain how Don felt , or how Matt eventually would . The mountain was beautiful ; perhaps that is all that has to be said . We needed a fourth man . Lurking in the back of my mind was one of our best friends at Harvard , a climber whose only drawback seemed to be inex  --  perience . But Ed Bernd had learned climbing more quickly in his two years with the H.IVI.C. than anyone I 'd ever known . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he had skipped several grades to emerge as a very good technical climber . That kind of progress always makes one wary , but Matt and I agreed that Ed showed uncommon judgment as well . Personally , he would be very good ; his outstanding character  --  istic was a cheerful , easygoing spirit which Matt , Don and I lacked . In the middle of April , Matt and 1 went up to Ed 's room . When we asked him to go with us , he did n't know at first what to say . He was flattered too much to conceal it , but we insisted that he not let that influence his decision , Yet there never seemed , after the first moment , to be any hesita  --  tion in his mind ; even though it would be hard for him to finance , he assured us he would make it work . Ed was like that ; if he wanted things to work , they usually did . Immediately he entered with us into the final planning period , a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frantic . Not only did Ed 's buoyancy through it all surprise and please Matt and me , but it added to our confidence . Now that Ed was with us it seemed ridiculous that we should ever ha , , e had doubts about him . After pitching our tents , we basked in the sun the rest of the day , not out of laziness , but because the time to travel on Alaskan glaciers is at night . Until late July , it is light enough even at midnight for comfortable travel . It took us two days to lug all our supplies across the four miles of glacier to a site beneath Hunting-ton 's face that we decided to call base camp . Ap  --  propriately , we finished the drudgery of hauling on July 4 , a beautiful day . Ed set off a bunch of his loudest firecrackers to celebrate . For several days in a row , Ed and Matt occu  --  pied one of our two-man tents , while Don and I slept in the other . We pitched them so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice " hotel " arrangement especially handy for cooking and for conversation . Both Matt and Ed had seemed , during the first days . a bit depressed ; cer  --  tainly Ed was less buoyant than usual , and Matt acted unenthusiastic . Neither Don nor I worried about this . It was an inevitable reaction to the sudden transition from the outside world . On July 4. the same clay we finished the hauling . Matt , Don and 1 started to explore the steep . cre  --  vassed section of icefall above base camp that lay between us and the face . To begin the real climb  --  ing. we had to reach a pass , which we called simply " the col " ( a mountaineering term for a high gap in a ridge . between Huntington and a small peak to the west . The connecting ridge joined the face two fifths of the way up . where it merged com  --  pletely in it . But we would have to climb that lower , jagged ridge to get to the face itself . The ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the avalanches from above and made the route less than suicidal . Don took over the lead for the last bit to the col . He was able to make three tricky snowshoe steps right up to the very top of it . Before Matt or I Top : Mott Hale rappels down frost Om rack orerhang of the N we .

We could n't even see the bottom ; mist was whipping by as the wind reached us. and all we could sense was an uncon  --  tainable space beneath Our feet . The feel* was sudden and vivid enough so that I did n't really feel comfortable standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely big enough for the three of us . We started down to tell Ed about our progress . There , on the col. the serious climbing would be  --  gin the next day . The jagged ridge had been the unknown factor on our route , since none of the photos we had stud  --  ied showed it well . We had anticipated little trou  --  ble on it , though , because it was less steep than the face above . But now we were n't so sure . In the first place , every foot of the ridge was studded with large cornices  --  overhanging lips of snow that the wind had spent all winter building up and that would collapse within a month . Moreover , all the cornices hung over the near side , so that the min  --  ute we began climbing on the ridge we would have to stay slightly below its crest on the other side , with that awful 3.000-foot drop beneath our feel . We divided the ridge with four names . The first long , jagged section of it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had flourished while the ridge was being formed . Above that we distinguished two steep snowfields. set sideways to the ridge . as the Lower and Upper parks . Connecting them was a 100-foot ice gully , the Alley . We hoped in two or three days to reach the Alley . and from there to spend a day crossing the Upper Park . above which rose the face . monolithic , ominous . As it turned out , reaching the face was to take us 20 days . We encountered a series of discourag  --  ing setbacks that brought us near to abandoning the expedition altogether . On July 5 a huge cornice of snow collapsed beneath my feet . The warm weather had made the snow so dangerous that we were forced to discontinue our efforts after an ad  --  vance of only 30 feet . We decided to spend the rest of the day digging a snow cave just below the col . This was to be our second camp , The following two days , the 6th and 7th , were colder , but snow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sought our snaillike prog  --  ress to a complete atgindstill . A warm , steady rain reduced the route to slush and made climbing pointless  --  and quite dangerous . We dragged up some supplies from base camp and holed out in the cave to wail for the weather to break . On the 10th it cleared , and we experienced our first good day ofclimbing . Working in relays we established seven new pitches ( or seven ropelengths ) up the moun  --  tain . taking us finally past the Stegosaur and onto the Lower Park . But the encouragement of the first good day waned and died : A four-day storm besieged us . Every night we woke and prepared to climb , but the weather and the warmth frustrated our ef  --  forts . We had begun to feel the time pressure ; we were way behind schedule . We decided we had to force things . Don and I started out first to clear the route ; Matt and Ed followed with the bare minimum of a camp . I We worked regularly in teams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns advancing the route , with the other acting in sup  --  port . bringing up supplies . I In six hours Don an:1 1 were able to advance two more pitches  --  almost to the end of the Lower Park . Meanwhile . Matt and Ed had reached the top of our highest pitch but were unable to Find a suitable campsite . The in  --  creasing fury of the storm finally forced them to chop a tent platform out of a 45-degree slope of ice . At midnight . near exhaustion after 19 straight hours of work , they piled into the tent . The storm continued . On the 18th Don and I tried to bring a load of supplies up to them , but were unable to get anywhere through the sticky out of their camp since pitching it . but they were other  --  wise in good shape , and that , at least , cheered us up . Don stayed with Ed in the tent . while Matt descended with me . The next day the weather broke and the two of us managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Don and Ed were climbing above the Upper Park , confronting the face itself . By the time Matt and I had made the return trip back to the cave , a second storm began -- and continued , without change , for three days . This seemed to be the firm/ blow to our chances . In de  --  spair Matt and I discussed other possibilities , even that of abandoning the route altogether and trying to salvage something for the summer , like a new route on Hunter . In the depth of gloom I looked around for someone , something . to blame , but all that I had was the exasperating feeling of our in  --  adequacy . At last the storm abated somewhat . On the 23rd we set out for the Alley Camp . as we had begun to call the tent Don and Ed were occupying . We had hoped they might be climbing today , but as we ap  --  proached the tent it became obvious they were still in it . They 'd managed only two and a half new pitches in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harder by far than any  --  thing on the ridge . I saw no reason to be encouraged . But Ed was inexplicably enthusiastic . " The climbing 's beauti  --  ful up there , " he said . " We 'll make it , Dave , you wait and see . " I got annoyed . It irritated me that he did n't see how poor our chances were ; I thought it was evidence of poor judgment . Only months later , after the expedition , did I think of that mo  --  ment again ; only then was I reminded of it by re  --  calling that , after all , I had been wrong and Ed right . And only then did I realize how important Ed 's enthusiasm . his refusal to give up , had been to all of us . On the 25th of July our 20 days of despair ended . The day dawned perfectly clear . Matt and I climbed for six hours , but despite the good weather , we were able to advance no farther than Don and Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely by the accumulated snow and ice from the storm . But the following day . also per . fectly clear , we flew over the old route in only two hours and began advancing successfully beyond it . Though we were climbing now on 60-degree rock and ice , with a 4.500-foot drop below us. the going was fairly easy . For the first time on the expedi  --  tion , for me at least , the climbing had become an unmixed pleasure . We now faced three choices . Matt and I were just below the hardest part of the whole face , no matter which route we took . On the right we could just see it now ) lay a remarkable hollow , a cave within a cave , sheltered by nested overhangs If we could get there . we might camp in it and eventually traverse even farther right , beyond and above it . at last heading toward the summit along a thin rock rib . But getting to the double cave looked very hard , and we knew the traverse beyond might be seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long smooth slab . averaging a frightening 80 degrees . There would be no possibility of climbing it free . But we could see that the pencil-thin cracks in it tended to petea out , leaving blank gaps of smooth rock , into which we should not even be able to get pitons . Pitons are metal pegs that are hammered into cracks a the rock . A carabiner , an oval snap-link , is at  --  tached to the head . or eye . of the piton . and the climbing rope is clipped into the carabiner. thus anchoring the lead climber to the slope in case he should fall . ) On the left we could see our third alternative . A steep ice gully led up 300 feet . stopping under a huge " ceiling . " an overhang that split the face without a break . Imagine an ant climbing a wall inside a room . then heading out . upside down , across the ceiling . That is what would be required of us for 50 feet . with the aid . of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was one in the ceiling . Those were the choices . After a short discus ' sion Matt and I chose the left-hand route . The ceiling might be the most difficult of all the prob  --  lems embodied in all three choices , but at least ' it was a short , one-pitch problem . not a matter of sustained severity . We managed to reach the ceiling . or Now . 3S we had begun to call it . in three pitches . and in a couple of hours of concentrated effort . negotiated our way over it .

While I was leading , that day . I was most acutely aware of the pleasure of contrast in my fingers between the cold give of the snow and the warm dryness of the rock , between the smooth ice and the rough granite . More than to anything else , my fingers were sensi  --  tive to the rock ; they moved quickly over it , learning its shape better than my eyes could , settling instinctively in the right grip . While I belayed Matt. my lingers only handled the rope , through muffling mittens ; then the pleasure was visual : All our belay spots allowed us to look outward .

It would not have satisfied us , obviously , to sit on some safe sun deck , idly pawing a few chunks of rock and ice for our sensual amusement . The mind can never really feel , nor can it stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know ; in fact , part of the breathless urgency of that day 's climbing for me came from an  --  other kind of awareness , a detached knowledge that came only from my mind ; a sense that the universe was looking over our shoulders . Climbing is defined by a purposed completion , the summit ; yet the best of it is never that final victory , for after that there is only the descent . The best moments lurk in the tension just before success . On the 27th and the 28th the weather continued to hold . Matt and I spent both days bringing up loads to support Don and Ed , who would now continue the assault above the Nose . They had had to spend all of the 27th and most of the 28th cutting out a platform beneath the Nose to pitch the tent for the camp . But they were ready the next day to push the route above the Nose , as far as they could , maybe to a point in reach of the summit . If only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per lect clay in a row , it was almost more Ihan we could believe , Don and Ed got moving by 7:30 in the morning . Quickly over the Nose , hey faced an-climbed rock anti ice friar , ificre on . ErI started to lead the first new pitch , Sud denly he remembered he 'd forgotten his ice ax in the rush to get started . So Don and Ed took turns leading with Don 's ax . while the second man used one of our aluminum daggers for balance and purchase . Although it was awkward , it seemed to work . To make things more unsettling , they had only live or six limed ropes and about a dozen pitons . Mall and I had not yet been able to bring up supplies to them ; they could expect us to reach the tent sometime that day with more of everything , but the beautiful weather could n't be wasted . They would go as high as they reasonably could . They left fixed ropes on the first three pitches . then decided to save their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitches , where they would be most helpful on the descent . Don led another pitch , their easiest yet . At the Lop of it he realized with excitement that he was standing beside the large . smooth pillar we had noticed in the pictures we had studied , which he knew marked the beginning of the last rock barrier . Ed led into a steep couloir ( a gully , usually filled with ice or snow ) , now hard blue ice in which he labo  --  riously had to chop steps . But he reached rock on the opposite side where he could get in a good anchor . So far they had used only five pitons in five pitches  --  the absolute minimum , cer  --  tainly fewer than they would have used if they had plenty to spare . But they had climbed fast . The snow was stiff , - .011 ( 1. t114. rock was warming up , 9,0 ( ( jai it looked is if they might he able to climb the 70-degree cliff above then hare-handed . Don began the cliff . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trying to save the pitons , he went V ) feet before he pal one in . It rang solidly ag he pounded it  --  thank God for the fine rock on this route ! Thirty feet above that he was faced by a blank section , unclimbable free . He hammered in a poor piton , one that would n't go all the way in but vibrated noisily as he hit it . But at least it would hold his weight ; with a stirrup he surmounted the blank stretch . Difficult as it was . the climbing exhilarated him , especially knowing , as both Ed and he did , that above the cliff lay only the long steep summit ice field . Don climbed into a wide chimney , moved up it 15 feet , but found the top blocked by a little ceiling . There was a way out to the left , if only there was one hand-hold at the top of his reach Except for a thin crack , though , there was nothing . Choosing his smallest piton , he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cau  --  tiously , putting a carabiner through the piton 's eye to hold on to . It felt in  --  secure , but did n't budge ; it would probably hold , but he was 40 feet above the bad piton . 70 feet above his good one . Moving delicately , put  --  ting as little weight on the piton as pos  --  sible , he swung himself up and around the corner . Ed , watching tensely , saw Don step onto the snow above the high  --  est rock . The cliff was climbed . Don quickly brought Ed up . He led a short pitch on crusty snow above , which seemed to lie just below the edge of tiomething . Topping the rnn , he looked ahead in amazement .

But it meant that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ed finished the pitch and brought 1 ) on up . Four hundred feet above them stood the only bit of rock in the whole expanse , an outcrop about 10 feet high . They decided to aim for it . Four quick pitches on the open slope brought them to it . The last 5t ) feet be  --  fore the rock were steeper , and the sun had started to undermine the ice . They reached the rock with a feeling of relief and agreed that the snow conditions would only get worse for the next few hours . Choosing the one small ledge the rock offered , they chopped a little plat  --  form on it and pitched the tiny two-man bivouac tent Don had made . It was crowded inside , but warm . Holding a stove on their laps , they could melt ice chips to make water . It was about live in the afternoon . They decided to wait for night , then go all out for the summit . It was still a long way , perhaps live more hours if things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had started at 11:15 A.M. from the Alley Camp . On a hunch , I had suggested that we take our down jack  --  ets and an extra lunch , as well as the ropes and pitons we were relaying up to Don and Ed . We made very good time , reaching their tent beneath the Nose inonly Iha ' half hours .

It was about 3:30 P.M. ; the snow was just be  --  ginning to deteriorate in the sun . At the top of the 37th pitch I saw that the anchor piton was a poor one . and looked around for a place to put a new one . After about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of the piton . Since I was n't sure how long the piton 's blade was , I had no way of judging how far into the crack it had been hammered . But there was a fixed rope leading above to the next piton , so it seemed safe . Matt started to lead , holding the fixed rope wrapped around his left arm . Only four feet above me he stopped on a steep ice-step to tighten his right crampon , which seemed to be coming off . As he pulled on the strap , his foot slipped and he fell on top of me . Not alarmed . I put up a hand to ward off his crampon , holding him on belay with the other . As his weight hit me , I felt the snow platform I had stomped for my feet collapse . But I was tied in with only a foot or two of slack , and I knew that the anchor would catch me imme  --  diately , and I would have no trouble catching Matt a foot or two below me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I realized the piton must have pulled out , but wondered in a blur why the fixed rope was n't holding me ; had it come loose too ? We were falling to  --  gether , gaining speed rapidly .

I n11,1 of con trol. f was still , holding the rope in a belay , I mi I could do nothing to stop us . The mountain was flashing by beneath us , and with detachment I thought , " This is what it 's like ... ? Suddenly we stripped . Malt was sit  --  ting on top of me . Fur an instant we did n't dare breathe . " Do n't move ! " I said . " We could start going again ! " Now the fear , which we had n't had time to feel as we fell , swept over us . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe those bounces had n't broken my bones . But I could move all right . I did n't seem to be bleeding . " I think so , " I said . " Are you ? " " I guess . I lost my ice ax , though . " " We 've got to get a piton in imme  --  diately , " I said . I managed to hammer in several poor ones . We could relax a little now , but trying to relax only made us more frightened . Matt had lost the crampon he was adjusting and both mittens . My right crampon had been knocked off , but it hung from my ankle by the strap . We were bruised , but unhurt . Matt still had his hand wrapped around the fixed rope , yet we had been falling without any apparent retarda  --  tion . I looked up ; the fixed rope , no longer attached to the anchor I had been belaying from , still stretched in one long chain to the anchor on the next pitch beyond . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice where his fallhad started . Then we saw U , at the climbing rope had snagged above us on a little nubbin of rock . That was apparently what had stopped us .

Matt reluctantly agreed . We continued , still shaky and ner  --  vous . Now we deliberately overpitoned the route , making it as safe as was hu  --  manly possible . As we climbed , we re  --  gained confidence . Soon we no longer had Ed 's and Don 's fixed ropes to fol  --  low , but their steps were clear . Won  --  dering where they had climbed the cliff , I suddenly saw a fixed rope dan  --  gling down it . The sight was more than exciting ; it was reassuring as well . I led the cliff , marveling at the dif  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put about five more in . As the sun passed over For  --  aker , low to the west . I emerged on the summit ice field . There was still no sign of Don and Ed , but as I belayed Matt up I heard Ed shout to us from some  --  where above . " Where are you ? " I yelled back . " In the rock outcrop ! " We could n't see them , but hearing their voices again was thrilling . Matt and I hurried up the steep ice to join them . Trying not to overstate it , we described our near-accident . Ed , espe  --  cially , seemed disturbed ; but the safety of numbers and the realization that now we could go as a rope of four , to  --  gether to the summit , made up for all our misgivings . We ate a few candy DEATH IN A FAR PLACE hairs as the sun set behini I McKinley , and the nunml : sins laded into the dusky pallor of early night . Around ten o'clock we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tie in at thafoot intervals instead of the usual 140 . Don went first , I second . Matt third , while Ed brought up the rear . It grew rapidly dark . Soon I could see Don only as a faint silhouette in the sky , seeming to walk toward Cassio  --  peia . We were getting tired ; the dark  --  ness made our effort seem more private , more detached from the mountain beneath us . After live pitches , at half-past midnight , we reached the summit ridge . We could scarcely tell we were there , except by the gradual leveling of the steep slope . We knew the far side was festooned with cornices overhang  --  ing the Ruth Glacier , so we did n't go all the way up to the ridge 's level crest . Now all that remained was the quar  --  ter-mile across to the summit , a nar  --  row , airy walkway with a 5,000-foot drop on the left and a 6,000-foot drop on the right . For 600 feet we moved continuously , a ghostly walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . and 1 had the illusion for an instant that we were the only people alive in the world . Soon we faced two flutings. short walls of vertical snow carved and crusted by the incessant wind . Here it was imperative for the four of us to spread as far apart as possible . Don started up toward the first fluting as I belayed from a not very solid ice ax . Traversing high , he stuck his foot through the cornice and quickly pulled it back . Through the hole he could see the dull blueness of the Ruth Glacier below . He returned to my belay spot , near exhaustion from the tension and exertion of a whole day of leading . We traded places and I started for the fluting , approaching it lower . The light was returning ; an orange wall of flame lit the tundra north of McKinley . The snow was terrible . I used one of our longest aluminum daggers in my left hand , my ax in the right , trying to plant something in the snow I could hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trough out of the fluting , I could half climb , half chimney up it . Just beyond its top the second fluting began . Don came up to belay me for the new obstacle . It was a little harder , but with a last spurt of energy I got over it . Eventually all four of us were up . Then there were only three pitches left , easy ones . and suddenly I stood on top . It was 3:30 in the morning . We 'd been going for 16 hours with  --  out rest , and now we were too tired even to exult . The sun had just risen in the northeast ; 130 miles away we could see Mount Deborah , only a shadow in the sky . As Don looked at it I said . " This makes up for a lot . " He nodded . There was no one to tell about it . There was , perhaps , nothing to tell . All the world we could see lay motion  --  less in the muted splendor of sunrise . Nothing stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Had we been able to hear a bird calling from some pine tree , or sheep bleating in some valley , the summit stillness would have been familiar ; now it was differ  --  ent. perfect ; it was as if the world had held its breath for us . We sat down just beneath the top , ate a little of our lunches and had a few sips of water . There was so little to do , nothing we really had the energy for , no gesture appropriate to what we felt we had accomplished : only a numb happiness . We photographed each other and the views , trying even as we took the pictures to impress the sight on our memories more indelibly than the cameras could on the film . If only this moment could last , I thought , if no longer than we do . But I knew even then that we would forget , that some day all I should remember would be the memories themselves , rehearsed like an archaic dance ; that I should stare at the pictures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that had slipped out of my hands and spilled in the darkness of the past . Ed , who was normally a heavy smoker , had sworn off it for the whole expedition . But out of his inexhaustible pockets he now pulled three cigarettes . He had no trouble lighting them ; after smoking two , though , he felt so light  --  headed he had to save the third . One of the things he must have looked for  --  ward to , I realized , was that ritual smoke on the summit , partly because of the surprise he knew it would cause us . But that was only one of Ed 's rea  --  sons for being there . a minor one . I thought then , much as I had when Matt and I sat on the glacier just after flying in , that I wanted to know how the others felt and could n't . Trying to talk about it now would have seemed profane ; if there was anything we shared , it was the sudden sense of quiet and rest . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally reached culminated ambitions and secret desires we could scarcely have articulated . And the chances are that our various dreams were different . Summits look remarkably like other parts of their mountains . The air is the same , if a little thinner , as that at the bottom ; the snow there would melt in one 's hand to the same dreary water that flows from its foot . Men , among them mountaineers , have claimed that the only discovery one can make by climbing is that of oneself . But there must be easier ways ; and anyway , is that discovery as important as others we might attempt with the same effort : Will it cure loneliness ? Will it make death sweet ? Yet I have come down from the mountains no better compre  --  hending who I am or why I climbed them than when I set out , and still been happy . Climbers take risks ; and to climb is so exclusively involving that it temporarily approximates life . H the old question , the one Mallory tried to answer , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet it rationally . Perhaps , if one were immortal , he would feel com  --  pelled to ask an ordinary person , " Why do you live ? " How well could that em  --  barrassed mortal answer ? Beyond the neatness of any rationale for life ties its untranslatable glory , the elemental courage of wanting to live . Climbing is serious , because it is like life for us who do it , not like a game ; perhaps we can only betray it by trying to explain our reasons . It was getting a little warmer . We knew we had to get down before the sun weakened the snow , especially on the summit ice field . Each of us , as we left , took a last glance back at the sum  --  mit , which looked no different from when we had come , but for the faint footprints we had left near it . We put fixed ropes in on all the dif  --  ficult pitches , refusing to let up or get careless now that we were so tired . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though we carried them . When we reached the bivouac tent , we split into pairs to continue down . Ed and I went first , while Don and Matt packed up the little camp before follow  --  ing us . The sun , high in a still perfect sky , had taken the magic out of the mountain 's shapes ; only the soft early light and the tension of our expectancy could have left it as beautiful as it had been . At last , after 25 straight hours of technical climbing , we rappelled off the Nose and piled , all four together , into the tent . Now , finally , we could relax . But the tent was far too crowded . We felt giddy . We laughed and shouted as the edge of our alertness wore off . We had brought up our pint of victory brandy  --  blackberry-flavored  --  and now in  --  dulged in a few sips each , toasting everything we could think of . Each of us managed to doze off at some time or another , with someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon it grew unbearably hot and stuffy in  --  side , and the Nose began to drip ( ap  --  propriately enough ) . pouring water through the roof of the tent . We cooked up all our favorite delicacies , robbing the two food boxes rapaciously . By six o'clock it had started to cool again , and we saw that finally the weather might be turning bad . after six consecu  --  tive perfect days , a spell almost un  --  heard of in Alaska ; it was as if the storms had politely waited for us to finish our climb . We slept a little more , but still could n't get comfortable . Around 9:00 p.m . Ed suggested that he and I go down in the night to the Alley Camp . We were still tired , but it would n't be a difficult descent . We got dressed and were ready to go by 9:40 . The snow was in poorer condition than we liked ; it had n't refrozen vet . and might not that night , since a warm wind was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having been over them live times to his one , so I tried to shout instructions to him when the route was obscure . It began to get too dark to see a full rope length . As I went down the 29th pitch . I was feeling rather than seeing the holds . At the top of the 26th pitch , the ver  --  tical inside corner Don had led so well in crampons. we stopped to rappel . We stood , side by side . attached to the bottom of the fixed rope we had just used on the pitch above . In the dark , we could only discern the outlines of each other 's faces . Under our feet , we felt our crampons bite the ice ; just below the little ledge we stood on , the rock shrank vertically away and empty space lurked in the chasm below . It was too dark to see very far down . Above us the steepest part of the faceloomed vaguely in the night . Up there , on another ledge . Don and Matt were probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icicles dripped trickles of water that splashed on the rocks . The fixed rope was wet ; here and there it had begun to freeze . We did n't have an extra rope , so we untied and attached ourselves to he fixed line , setting up a rappel with the climbing rope . Ed attached a carabiner to the anchor , through which he clipped the climbing rope , so that we could pull it down from the bottom . He wrapped the rope around his body and got ready to rappel . We were tired , but were getting down with reasonable speed . It was close to midnight . " Just this tough one . " I said . " Then it 's practically walking to camp . " " Yeah , " Ed answered . He leaned back . Standing about five feet from him , I heard a sharp scraping sound . Suddenly Ed was flying back  --  wards through the air . I could see him fall , wordless , 50 feet free . then strike the steep ice below . " Grab something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sliding and bouncing down the steep ice , tangled in the rap  --  pel rope . He passed out of sight , but I heard his body bouncing below . From the route photos I knew where he had fallen . and that there was n't a chance of his stopping for 4.000 feet . Perhaps five seconds had passed . No warning , no sign of death  --  but Ed was gone . I could not understand . I became aware of the acute silence . All I could hear was the sound of water dripping near me . " Ed ! Ed ! Ed ! " I shouted . without any hope of an answer . What could have happened ? The piton was still intact , but the carabiner and rope were gone . It made no sense . I tried to shout for help but Matt and Don were nearly a thousand feet above , hidden by cliffs that deflected and snow that absorbed my voice . I re  --  alized they could n't hear me . Even the echo of my shouts in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either I must go up or I must go down . It was about an equal distance either way , but the pitches above were more difficult . I had no rope . There was no point going up . because there was nothing we could do for Ed . His body lay now . as far as anyone could ever know , on the lower Tokositna , inaccessible . An attempt even by the three of us to descend the 4.000 feet to look for him would be . sui  --  cidally dangerous . especially since we would have only one rope . If I went up . I should eventually have to go down again ; all it could do was add to the danger . I realized these things at the time . Yet the instinct , in my isolation . to try to join Matt and Don was so compelling that for a while I did n't even consider the other possibility . But it became obvious I had to go down . At least the fixed ropes were still in . I used two carabiners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steep pitch we had started to rap  --  pel . I moved jerkily. making violent efforts . telling myself to go more slowly . But I had to use the adrenalin that was racing through me now ; it was the only thing that could keep the crippling fear and grief away from me . I managed to get down the hard pitch . The snow on the Upper Park was in poor condition ; I broke steps out beneath me , but held my balance with the fixed rope . I realized that I was go  --  ing far too fast for safety , but slowing DEATH IN A FAR PLACE down was almost impossible . At arrived at the lent . The seven pits had taken lbniinntes , dangerously Iasi . But 1 was t , %% there was nothing to ( lo but watt , , , s Flu ' lent was full of Val cr . Mat t and 1 had left the hack door open ! In the dark 1 sponged it out , too tired to cry , in something like a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drugged sleep . In the morning I gradually woke out of a gray stupor . It seemed to be snow  --  ing lightly , 1 felt no sudden pang about the accident ; even in sleep I must have remained aware of it . I forced myself to cook and eat a breakfast , for the sake of establishing a routine , of oc  --  cupying myself . I kept thinking , What could hare happened ? The carabiner and rope were gone ; nothing else had been disturbed . Perhaps the carabiner had flipped open and come loose ; per  --  haps it had broken ; perhaps Ed had clipped in in such a way that he was n't really clipped in at all . Nothing seemed likely . It did n't matter , really . All that mattered was that our perfect expedi  --  tion had . in one instantaneous me  --  chanical whim , turned into a trial of fear and sorrow for me , as it would for Matt and Don when they found out , and into sudden blankness for Ed . His death had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our triumph . The time passed with terrible slow  --  ness . I knew Matt and Don would be taking their time , especially now that it was snowing . But I grew anxious for their arrival , afraid of being alone . I began to wonder what I would do if they did n't come . What if I heard them calling ( or help ? I would have to go up , yet what could I do alone ? I figured out that they had at most live days ' food at the Nose Camp . I had enough for twenty days for myself at the Alley Camp . So I would wait five or six days , and if there were no sign of them , I would try to finish the descent alone . At the cave I could stamp a message for Sheldon ; if he flew over , he would see it . If he did n't , I would eventually start to hike out , 70 miles down an unknown glacier , across rivers , through the tundra . . But these were desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take ; I forced myself to consider them so that no potential course of events could lurk unrealized among my fears . Already I had begun to miss Ed in a way separate from the shock and lone  --  liness . I longed for his cheeriness , the fund of warmth he had that Matt , Don and I did n't . I had wanted so much to relax in the tent , talking and joking with him . reliving the long summit day . I had n't climbed with him since July 11 . Now it was the last day of the month , and he was gone . I tried to relive for myself every mo- ment Ed and I had had together the last day , as if doing so could somehow salvage something from the tragedy . But my recollections had stuck on a remark he had made in the Nose Camp as we rested after the summit . 1 had told him that that was the best day I had ever had climbing . Ed had said , " Mine too . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " I thought he was still upset about Matt 's and my near-accident and sug  --  gested so . But Ed thought a moment , then said , " No . It 's not only that , " We had n't pursued it . But his atti  --  tude had seemed strange to mc . For mu , there was no question but that it would have been worth doing all over again . Nor for Don . And 1 thought Matt would have said so , too , But Ed had climbed less than we had ; perhaps he was n't so sure that climbing was the most important thing in his life , as we would have said it was in ours . Now his remark haunted me . The ac  --  cident , ultimately inexplicable to me beyond its mechanical cause , which it  --  self we would never be sure of , seemed that much more unfair because of what Ed had said . It would have been better , fairer perhaps . had it happened to me . Yet not even in the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that irreducible selfishness seemed to prove to me that beyond our feeling of " commitment " there lay the barriers of our separate self-love . We were will  --  ing to place our lives in each other 's hands , but I would n't have died for Ed . What a joke we played on our  --  selves ! The whole affair of mountaineer  --  ing seemed a farce , then . But the numbness returned ; I told myself to wait , to judge it all in a better perspec  --  tive , months , years from now . By that night there had still been no sign of Matt or Don . I took another sleeping pill and finally dozed off . Sometime in the night . on the edge of sleeping and waking , I had a vision of Ed stumbling , bloody , broken , up to the tent , yelling out in the night , " Why did n't you come to look for me ? " I woke with a jolt , then waited in the dark for the dream to dissolve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to look for Ed 's body . For me , alone , without a rope , to try to de ? scend the 4.000 feet would certainly have been suicide . Yet because there was nothing to do and because I had n't seen Ed 's dead body , a whisper of guilt had lodged in my subconscious . a whis  --  per that grew to Ed 's shout in my nightmare . The next day , August 1 , dragged by as the last one had . The weather was good for a few minutes in the morning , then had clouded up again ; but at least it had stopped snowing . Around 10 P.M. I thought I heard a shout . I looked out of the tent , but saw nothing . I was starting to attribute the sound to ice breaking loose some  --  where or a rock falling , when sud  --  denly Matt came in sight at the top of the Alley . He let out a cheery yell when he saw me . I could n't answer , but sim  --  ply stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled , " How are things down there ? " I pretended I could n't hear him . Before Matt got to the tent , he suddenly saw that there was only one pack beside it . Then I said , " Matt , I 'm alone . " He belayed Don all the way down before either of us said anything to him . When Matt told him , Don stood there , frozen momentarily , looking only at the snow in front of him . Then . in a way I can not forget , he seemed to draw a breath and swallow the impact of the shock . " All right , " he said . " Let 's get inside the tent . " His voice , calm as ever , was heavy with a sudden fatigue . But once they knew , once I saw that they were taking it without panic , be  --  ing strong , 1 felt an overwhelming gratitude toward them : out of my fear . an impulse like love . We spent a crowded , uncomfortable night . The tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small for the three of us . But the next day it was storming , probably the roughest day we had had . We spent most of the day waiting for a letup . But as long as we had the rest of the descent before us , we could not relax . Despite the storm , we decided to go in the late afternoon . The snow conditions were absolutely terrible , by far the worst we had yet run into . A full foot of loose powder overlay our steps ; often the steps them  --  selves had melted out , leaving only the slick surface of the ice . We went con  --  tinuously at first , but at a pace slower than a snail 's . Don had to rechop steps under the snow , reaching awkwardly down with his ax . The fixed ropes were coated with ice , sometimes in a solid sheath a quarter-inch thick . At one point Don and I stood on top of two towers while Matt climbed in the gap between . The rope stuck ; I yelled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear each other 's shouts perfectly , but Matt seemed oblivious . I started to go back for him , but at last Matt heard Don and answered . His voice sounded far away . Finally I got within a few feet of the top of the rappel . But I could n't reach it ; Matt was stuck in an incredible tangle at the last piton . 1 heard him swearing at the ropes , then suddenly a frightened cry from Don as he ap  --  parently fell . The fixed rope caught him . but he could n't find any of the steps . I felt annoyed at myself and at Matt and Don because we were climb  --  ing so poorly . But it was so cold , and I felt the tiredness seeping even into the edge of nervousness I had known for three days . We were almost down ; then there would be no more hard climbing . For 18 days we had hung , every min  --  ute , over that abyss , never less than 3,000 feet above its hidden floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last Matt got the tangle straight  --  ened out . I reached the piton and be  --  layed them down . We were together again . It almost seemed too great an effort to tie the two ropes together so that we could pull them down after we had rappelled . The rope we had left there , moreover , had frozen in at the bottom so that we could scarcely pull up enough slack to pass around our bodies . But finally we managed to set the thing up . I stepped over the side of the ridge with a conscious sense of re  --  lief , and quickly rappelled down , knock  --  ing the ice off the rope we had left . Matt and Don followed . Then we pulled the ropes down , cutting ourselves off for good from our route , from the far . frozen summit . We got back to the cave at 3:30 in the morning . It had taken us eight hours to descend what we had expected to complete in two . We found the cave shrunken in size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We went ( sit-side around noon on the third to stamp a sign , FLY Our , in the snow . We were in no emergency now ; there was no reason to call for help . If Sheldon did n't see our sign within 10 days or so , we would begin to hike out . We saw no point in searching for Ed 's body . Besides , any search we could make , even plane-assisted , would he dangerous : we would have to scour the bottom of a 6,000-foot avalanche chute , down which rocks and ice spilled con  --  stantly . After the five days of storm , Ed 's body was likely to he covered by new snow , and the chances were grxxl that that snow would n't melt before winter . All that was mortal of Ed would freeze into the glacier . Within a year there would be no part of him near its surface . Gradually the remnants of his being would sink within the Toko  --  sitna , locked in unfathomable ice . On August 6 the weather cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . The new snow had plastered our route , making it look cold and splendid . In the early evening the sun lit high , ribbed clouds above IsIckinley and cast a brown warmth on the rock of the face , reflected in ghostly radiance on the shadowed floor of the glacier . Never had the mountain seemed more beautiful , not even in its first un  --  touched magic . Sheldon did n't come . As it got dark , we lit the few candles we had brought , and set them up in the snow cave to read and write by . After we extinguished the candles , I lay awake thinking . I was trying to imagine how I could tell Ed 's parents . I thought of the things that , sooner or later , people would say about Ed 's death , as attempts at consolation . It would be said that Ed died doing what he enjoyed most , that his last conscious moments were happy ones . But he did not want to die ; every part of him that was aware he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was powerless ; there was never enough happiness to last as long as we would have it . It would be said that the way he died was some  --  how " right . " But he did not have to die ; to die young is never right . It would be said that . at least . he never had time to feel pain or even fear . But . though I could not have wanted Ed to die suffering . dying without pain or fear seems to me the obverse of living without joy . Let us be aware of our end . because life is all we have . At 4:00 sm . I woke . hearing the faint hum of an airplane. 1 put my-boots on and ran out of the cave . It was Sheldon . Don and Matt , also awake now , joined me as we tried to point out our sign in the snow . Sheldon seemed to see it and acknowledged us by circling . We packed up rapidly . then left the cave , looking back as we descended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheldon returned , landing easily on the hard glacier . He had seen our tracks to the summit live days before , and Matt and Don in the Nose Camp . but he had no idea that anything had gone wrong . All I could do was explain the facts of the accident . I could n't explain beyond that ; I could n't tell him the urgency of our happiness be  --  fore . We had spent 40 days alone there . only to come back one man less , it seemed . We had found no answers to life : perhaps only the room in rs Inch to look for them .
