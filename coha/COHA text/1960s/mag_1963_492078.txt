Twin scandals : Dumping his hand with a baseball bat . If college players think that fixing is a little bit of underhanded play with street-corner gamblers , they are crazy . Molinas is big-league . Then the courtroom door opens and a clerk calls Molinas inside . The jury is back . The forelady , whose name is Elsie Walker , has on a leopard pillbox hat , and she is nervous and has trouble looking at Molinas as she says yes , he is guilty . The five counts on which he is convicted , involving perjury and conspiracy , carry a maximum penalty of 36 years in prison . Molinas tries to show no emotion . He sits straight up at the defense table . He says he will appeal . Mothers do n't cry anymore It is 10:15 at night , and only a redheaded girl , the defense lawyer 's secretary , sits in the spectators ' seats . That is one innovation in these college basketball scandals , anyway . We are beginning to understand that they are commonplace , Once mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when their sons were brought in for dumping . But district attorneys have become bored with prosecuting collegeplayers . Now the players are used as witnesses . Then they are sent home . Only the fixers must stand in court , and few care about them . The jury and the judge leave . Molinas , an overcoat draped over his arm , stands with two officers who are going to take him through a door and down a hallway toward the Tombs , where Molinas is going to spend his first night in a jail cell . " Hey , " a gray-haired court attendant calls to the officers . " Take care of him good . Get him a big bed . He 's a basketball player , you know . " This is how the Jack Molinas era of basketball fixing comes to an end . The temptation is , of course , to place all the blame squarely on Molinas and the nine others in the case who pleaded guilty or " no defense . " Here is an amoral , twisted man who would do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix proposition . On a couple of occasions he arranged for an 18-year-old Negro high-school player from Brooklyn to go out with white dates and thus land in Molinas 's hip pocket for an entire college career . Molinas was also a master at teaching at least one apprehended player the fine art of perjury . As a matter of form he stood against everything that even smacked ofhonesty . But , as bad as Molinas was , he is only an illustration of the many troubles that college basketball faces , After everything was over on this night back in January , Detective Laurendi waited for the elevator with a pile of black-leather books under his arm , and he talked about them . " This is all the records for the trial , " Laurendi said . " Every ten years we do this . So we wait ten more years from now , and then we 'll have a bigger and better fixer in court for you . " There is no reason to say the detective is wrong . Colleges have not changed their ways appreciably since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is frightening , " Joe Lapchick was saying one day in his office at St. John 's University in New York . " If there is anything that seems akin to a blind alley , this is it . " Lapchick has been in basketball for 51 years . He was the center on the Original Celtics , the first big pro team in the game , and since 1922 he has been coaching at St. John 's , with nine years out for the job of running the professional New York Knickerbockers . Once he felt he had a sure way to teach the kids playing for him about the evils of dumping . " 1 thought this hook would do it , " Lapchick said . " Every player I 've had , college or pro , since 1951 has had to read this book and then sign his name on one of the blank pages . I thought if this did n't teach them , nothing would . " The hook is a thick , black scrapbook which is filled with newspaper clippings of the 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the first two pages of the book are taken up with eight-column front-page photos of players covering their faces while being hooked at a police station . The pictures should he enough to frighten a young college man . But last year one of Lapchick 's players had to go before a grand jury , and the people from the district attorney 's office said later that the player was not telling all he knew . " I do n't have my head under the table , " Lapchick was saying . " 1 try to do this right . I know that , if you keep bringing up a thing continually , kids tend to ignore it . So I wait for a good chance and then bring in the book . " He shook his head . " The thing that frightens me is that this business never stopped after 1951 . What do we say to that ' ? Human dignity . Does n't that count anymore ? Everything you are doing is part of your background . ' Tomorrow is what counts for college kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better know what to do . If some guy gets raised ahead of you in the office and you yell and walk out , that 's self-satisfaction of ego , no solution . You 're a quitter . You 've got to learn to grit your teeth and do better . " That 's what we 're trying to teach these kids here . That 's our job . Make them learn something from basketball , and not just the game itself . " So %% hat happens ? " He flipped the black scrapbook to the last page . Pasted on it was a Willard Mullin cartoon of Jack Molinas . The cartoon ran the day Molinas was thrown out of pro basketball for gambling . " The date is 1954 , right ? " Lapchick said . " Now look at this . I have a whole new hook to fill since then . " The new one has a red cover . " 1 do n't know where it starts , " Lapchick said . " We used to say it was because colleges took in unqualified students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ' students involved in this one . We used to say it was because of gamblers in professional arenas . This time a graduate of an Ivy League school was behind it all , and games were being fixed in campus gyms . I do n't know what it is . All I know is that it is widespread and it is frightening . " Then he got up and went out onto the floor of the new St. John 's field house for practice . Lapchick had on a gray shirt and gray slacks . He stood at one end of the court and threw hard underhand passes to a big , blond kid named Ken Wirell , who would take them in the middle of a swing toward the basket , then go up for a lay-up . " Come on . " Lapchick kept saving to the kid . Then he would throw the ball harder . Since 1922 Joe Lapchick has been standing on a basketball court someplace and throwing these passes . Once he thought he knew everything about the game . And if something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But now they have a thing called dumping , and Lapchick tries to teach a defense against it , but he reallydoes n't understand what it is . Only the hundreds who have been involved can tell you that . A seedy gambler named Joe Hacken , who admitted fixing in this scandal , tried to explain it one day . " I 'm funny , but I used to admire a kid when he 'd turn me down , " Hacken was saying . " The kid made me feel good when he would take a walk on me . " " How many of them turned you down ? " Hacken shook his head . " Very , very few . Just a couple of kids . Everybody else went for it . " Everybody did it for a simple reason , " he went on . " Cash money . They thought they could make a fortune of money on basketball . That figures . The colleges already spoiled theta . The colleges give these kids money and deals . In other words , the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they fix games too ? Look . You could say I 'm bad . All right , I 'm bad . But what about the colleges ? Are they clean ? They 're in this just as deep as me . Only I have to do time in jail . The colleges , all they have to do is go out and get a new team . " Hacken was wearing a frayed overcoat with a newspaper jammed into one of the pockets . He needed a shave . He looked like a bum , and maybe you can call him a bum for what he did . But the man was telling the truth . Dr. Albert Jacobs , the president of Trinity College in Hartford , Conn. , adds thoughts of his own . " I resigned as chancellor of the University of Denver in the early part of 1953 because of the exact thing  --  recruiting  --  that you are talking about , " Dr. Jacobs was saying one day last month . " I simply could not stomach what was going on . An athlete out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fought against it . But the alumni are wildcats . So I left . " Now I 've followed this Molinas case closely . And I hold a definite view on the matter , I think the time has come when we no longer can temporize . We must change our whole system right now , and change it drastically . A college should admit a student only on the basis of academic ability , and it should give financial aid only when a student can show need . This business of athletic scholarships is only an open invitation to bribery and all the other things that we know go on . " Why , look at the Western Conference . They have gone so far as to draw rules about how much an athlete can receive . He can only get so much for this and so much for that . In other words , they have a ceiling on benefits for athletes . It is ridiculous . And it is the duty of an educator to stand up and fight against this . But there are very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " Many colleges accept recruiting as a normal part of their athletic program . ( See A SCHOLARSHIP FOR BARRY , Page 20 ) . The reasoning is old and has been set down many times . The alumni who donate money want their school to have good teams . The school has a big field house and must pay for it with gate receipts . And a strong team is an excellent public-relations device for the school . So coaches , alumni and  --  at some colleges  --  paid talent scouts go out and hustle a kid unmercifully . Everybody says this is just part of the game and there is nothing wrong with it . But it does not take a genius to see that all of this can make an 18-year-old high-school kid a bit dizzy . Take the case of Connie Hawkins , a boy who lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn . This is a cruel area , with dope and holdups and muggings a part of everyday living . Young Hawkins lived with his mother in a stained railroad flat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day three kids from the neighborhood came into his living room and said they wanted to talk to him . " We got a way to make a lot of loot , " one of them said to Hawkins . " How ? " " A stickup , man . " " A stickup ? Stickup of what ? " " A bank , man . Look at this . We got plans and everything . " One of the other kids unfolded a diagram they had made of a bank . " Look at all the work we done on this thing , man . " " You crazy , " Hawkins said . He chased them . He always chased everybody who came around with an idea for mugging people or breaking into a store someplace . Connie was six-seven , he was still growing , and he was playing basketball for Boys ' High School . He was simply one of the best high-school basketball players anybody remembers ever seeing . He never had a quarter to his name , and he had only one pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But he never did a thing wrong in his life . In the spring of 1961 the colleges took over . Connie was on airplanes to Ohio State or Day-ton or Iowa , and people from colleges were coming into New York and taking him to dinner , and all of a sudden Connie Hawkins was the most important man in the world . He met Jack Molinas in the middle of this . And Jack Molinas introduced him to Joe Hacken , who " loaned " Hawkins $250 , and after that Connie Hawkins had to be a witness for the New York district attorney . He never dumped a game , but he quit college . There have been small concessions made . The consolidated universities of the state of North Carolina  --  North Carolina State and North Carolina  --  were limited to recruiting only two players from out of the state . The number of games each played was reduced , and the big Dixie Classic , a Christmas holiday tournament at North Carolina State , was abolished . But all this did was leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown little inclination to stop " fixing " young men with good jump shots and long , springy legs . Their policy seems to be , " We ' fix ' you , but do n't you ' fix ' us . Take from us . Take from alumni . Take from boosters . Take from everybody  --  except do n't take from gamblers . " As a result the fix or dump seems an inevitable part of the college basketball game . There arc people , important people , who do not look at it that way . They look at it from their offices as presidents of universities . They have several thousand students in school . They have large , powerful and costly athletic programs . if a couple of students get in trouble over basketball , is that significant enough to abandon an entire system ? Some university presidents say no . One is Dr. Frank A. Rose , president of the University of Alabama for five years and a major name in education . " It is easy to look through a keyhole at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dr. Rose says . " But it is , of course , inaccurate . We had two boys who were in trouble here and dismissed from the university . What are we doing to prevent any more trouble ? We are giving counsel . We are giving our students the moral guidance every university should . In other words , we are just doing our job as a university . Our job is not to abandon things . Our job is to teach and guide . " He could be right . So could the others who take his stand . You hope he is . It is a question that only time is going to settle . But since 1951 time has been putting an awful rap on colleges . The situation is getting tiresome , too , because here in the middle of the 1963 season nothing seems to have changed . " What am I doing ? " this fellow Al says over the phone . " I 'm out dealing basketball . What do you want ? I got Duke 7 over South Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loyola , I got Cincinnati . I got a big move on Seattle . What do you want to do ? " I want to give the whole business a pass . Maybe it 's all right for Nat Laurendi . He is one hell of a detective . Maybe he has the enthusiasm to work on this business 10 years from now . I do n't . This is the second time around on this thing for me  --  first 1951 , now the Molinas mess . There is no good reason why there wo n't be another mess . So I give it up . The colleges can have it . It is just that it makes you wonder : What kind of business are these colleges in ?
