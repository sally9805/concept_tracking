( See Cover ) The telephone was busy . First came a call from a Midwest Governor with a warning that labor trouble was brewing in his state-and a request that the U.S. Government step into the situation . Behind his big desk in a massive office building on Washington 's Constitution Avenue , Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg listened intently , scribbled down notes on a scratch pad , and then politely but firmly refused to intervene : " It 's my belief that it will be a lot better in the long run if we do not move in at this time . " <P> Minutes later , word came from an aide that about 100 workers had walked off their missile-site construction jobs near Denver 's Lowry Air Force Base . Goldberg called Lowry to find out what the trouble was-and learned that the men were protesting because a fence had been built by a nonunion contractor . He ordered tele grams sent to union officials , reminding them in no uncertain terms that they had made a no-strike pledge on missile-base construction projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I expect them to keep it . " <P> Still later , a Labor Department mediator called to ask for a little top-level pressure to push a labor-management settlement . " Yes , I think I can help , " replied Goldberg . And without bothering to check with the White House , Arthur Goldberg began dictating a telegram : " The President has asked me to urge ... " <P> In a daily dozen ways , Labor Secretary Goldberg , 53 , last week was speaking in the name of President John F. Kennedy on matters of deepest concern to the nation 's 72.2 million-man labor force . When some locals of the United Auto Workers staged the toilet strike against General Motors just as an agreement seemed imminent ( see BUSINESS ) , both U.A.W. President Walter Reuther and G.M. Negotiator Lou Seaton called Goldberg for advice . Patiently , Goldberg heard each man out , discovered areas of agreement , and eased them toward accord . Both sides were confident of an end to the walkouts this week . <P> Ready to Try . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary of Labor 's traditional function as a counselor . But in other labor disputes during his nine months in office , Goldberg has intervened more directly and forcefully than all his predecessors lumped together in the 48 years since labor became a Cabinet post . Using all the Administration 's influence and all the experience gained during his years as labor 's top lawyer and strategist , Goldberg has personally negotiated and mediated in strikes that have crippled the nation 's maritime industry , grounded most of its commercial airplanes and critically delayed its missile-site construction . Again , he has made sure that the curtain will rise next month on the 77th season of New York 's Metropolitan Opera by agreeing to arbitrate a dispute between the Met 's management and its musicians .
