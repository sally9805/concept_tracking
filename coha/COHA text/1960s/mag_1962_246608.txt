THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER ( 810 pp. ) - Edgar Snow-Random House ( $10 ) . <P> <P> In 1936 , when Mao Tse-tung had a price of $100,000 on his head and was hiding in a cave village with his dwindling Red army , a young correspondent named Edgar Snow tramped across north China to the Great Wall , found Mao and spent weeks talking social progress with him . He then hurried home to write Red Star Over China , an ardently naive treatise that predicted the ultimate victory of Mao and his Chinese Communists , who were not really Communists but agrarian reformers . <P> Two years ago , Snow returned to China to see Mao again and , as he reminds himself on nearly every page of his portly new book , his second visit was as much an achievement as his first . Reluctantly accredited by the State Department ( " someone we feel can not be objective " ) and enthusiastically accepted by the Peking government , Snow traveled 12,000 miles through New China , spent hours with Mao ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days with Chou Enlai . Just as time has not diminished Snow 's zest for a story , neither have events darkened his view of Mao 's China . Blue River . There is , of course , the matter of food shortage . But Snow argues that the famine of 1960 was vastly exaggerated by the Western press-even though Chou himself has pronounced it " the worst series of disasters since the 19th century . " Moreover , says Snow , what is a famine in New China would have been a feast in Old China . On this trip , he saw no starvation and little malnutrition . Everywhere he was struck with the sight of new cities , new highways and railroads , burgeoning new industries , happy people , smiling children . Crime has all but vanished , slums are clean and filled with bookstores and nurseries , soldiers are as dedicated as young priests , everyone conscientiously does his daily t'ai chi ch'aun calisthenics . Even the Yellow River , now dammed and tamed like everything else in China , runs blue- " blue as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wonderful , wait till you meet Mao . He is revered in Snow 's China like no one since Confucius . He speaks in witty epigrams , travels humbly among the people , even wears old cotton socks that droop charmingly around his ankles . Mao 's dearest wish , Snow reports , is to visit the U.S. , if only to swim the Potomac . And though Snow argues that the U.S. ought to quit its " aggressive outposts " like Formosa , Japan , South Viet Nam and South Korea , he sees the rude failure to invite Mao over for a visit as the " great error " in U.S. policy . <P> Iron &; Steel . What little Snow finds bad in New China he justifies by presuming that it would be much worse if Chiang Kai-shek were in charge . Promising later discussions that never materialize , he skims over the regime 's faults to exult in its virtues .
