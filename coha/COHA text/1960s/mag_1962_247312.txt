As damage suits for personal injuries suffered in auto accidents increase in number and produce greatly swollen sums in settlement , many a U.S. lawyer has become as familiar with Gray 's Anatomy as with Blackstone . Now he is likely to start studying Freud as well . Last week , as 1,800 members of the National Association of Claimants ' Counsel of America met in Denver to bone up on medicine , they heard the clearest descriptions yet offered of the psychological types that are most , and least , likely to crack up their cars . <P> After a study of hundreds of young men at Lowry Air Force Base , two Denver psychologists , Dr. Wilbur C. Miller and Dr. John J. Conger , put together composite personality pictures of high and low-risk drivers . As might be expected , the low-risk driver shows less hostility toward the world in general , and especially to organized authority ; he is more willing to obey the law unquestioningly . <P> But there are more subtle and less predictable differences . The low-risk driver 's equanimity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he knows where he is going in life , as well as on the road , and how he intends to get there . He is more likely than the high-risk driver to take on faith his parents ' religion . He is less imaginative , but more interested in questions of esthetics . His faults are usually an excessive need for conformity and to please others . <P> The high-risk driver 's obvious faults are ill-concealed hostility lurking just below the surface , and an egocentric disregard for others ' rights and feelings . Underlying these characteristics , say Drs . Miller and Conger , is dissatisfaction with his position in life and a lack of direction : he does not know where he is going , let alone how to get there . The high-risk driver is far more likely than others to act impulsively , and live in a world of fantasy . <P> The researchers found no physiological differences between the two types . Their blood pressures were in the same range , both at rest and under stress . In psychomotor skills ( brake reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-accident men rated a notch higher than low-risk types-but in responding more quickly they also made more mistakes . <P> In sum , the lawyers learned , life with an imaginative , volatile , high-risk driver is likely to be more stimulating and interesting than with a conventional plodder-but also shorter .
