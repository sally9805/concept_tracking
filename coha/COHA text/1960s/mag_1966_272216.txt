In the rapidly growing and robustly competitive business of auto and truck rentals , Avis , Inc. , makes much of the fact that it is only a hard-trying No. 2 . Obviously , No. 1 is the Hertz Corp. , with a rental fleet now totaling 125,000 vehicles . Hertz 's familiar yellow signs are out in 98 countries , most recently including Finland , New Guinea and the Dominican Republic . Revenues this year will top $300 million . <P> Yet last week Hertz itself agreed to become a No. 2 of a sort . The rental firm 's chairman , Leon C. Greenebaum , and Radio Corp . of America 's chief executive , Elmer W. Engstrom , jointly announced that after an exchange of stock valued at $185 million , Hertz will become a wholly owned RCA subsidiary . <P> If the announcement was sudden , it was not exactly surprising . Hertz constantly needs vast amounts of money to purchase new vehicles and open new locations , particularly in foreign nations , where the idea of car rentals has caught on fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , forced it , in Greenebaum 's words , to " pull back on some experimental work we 've been doing in developing new markets . " One pullback , for the time being : a market test in which Hertz had been making extra sports cars available to see how eagerly drivers with more funds and free time would rent them . Moreover , hard-striving Avis last spring pulled a march on its bigger competitor by accepting a takeover offer from International Telephone &; Telegraph , which has the money and means to make Avis larger than it is now . <P> For its part , RCA generates a sizable cash flow in its television operations , has been looking for companies outside the electronic field that it can acquire to keep its cash working profitably . <P> The Hertz-RCA fusion will mean benefits for both companies . Hertz , with Greenebaum still in the driver 's seat , will have more money to expand and keep its lead in the business . Meanwhile , having branched out from automobiles to leasing everything from construction cranes to hospital beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RCA is coming on fast as a manufacturer of computers . But most customers are anxious to lease such equipment rather than to buy it . Hertz 's longtime leasing experience will be handy .
