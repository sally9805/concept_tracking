As violence flares in U.S. ghettos , legal questions smolder in the embers : If the state is obliged to maintain civil order , must it indemnify the citizen for property loss and personal injury from riots ? <P> <P> There is no generally accepted answer in U.S. law . Since 1883 , when the Supreme Court ruled in Louisiana ex rel . Folsom v. New Orleans that legislatures created and therefore may withdraw or modify the right to riot relief , the question of liability has been bounced around by the states , cities and counties . <P> Meanwhile , insured claims for the Detroit riot losses are estimated at $200 million , the largest yet . ( Watts was $38 million , Newark $15 million . ) Total damage could be considerably higher . Some damaged ghetto properties were considered uninsurable . Insurance generally covers only about half the actual property damage in most riots . Moreover , most policies do not cover personal riot injuries . <P> Sovereign Immunity . Insurance companies confronted with Detroit claims can try to sue the city , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city , county or state liable for riot damages unless it has somehow acted negligently . Even then , many governmental bodies are protected by sovereign immunity , a musty theory that public monies can be used only for the general public , not to compensate individuals , such as riot victims . But legal scholars contend that sovereign immunity is unjust , illogical , and riddled with exceptions . Moreover , courts have gradually eroded or discarded the doctrine in several states . Once sovereign immunity is removed as a defense , a city or county is liable much like an individual charged with negligent performance of duty . <P> Roughly half the states now have statutes imposing some sort of liability on municipalities for riot damages . Illinois , which has the most comprehensive law ( 1961 ) , pays up to $30,000 for property or injury , including death , even when the municipality has not been negligent . New York has a liability law , but it was suspended during World War II ( for fear that wartime losses and injuries might be prohibitive ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan has no liability statute whatever . <P> New Jersey has imposed liability since 1877 for property damage in cities with paid police forces . However , the claimant can not collect if he was negligent in protecting his property or failed to advise police that it was in danger . To determine how the law affects victims of the Newark riot , merchants and tavernkeepers are lining up to file test cases . <P> Community Responsibility . Liability laws are in effect in three Pennsylvania counties : Philadelphia , Allegheny ( Pittsburgh ) and Northampton ( Easton ) . After the 1964 riots , Philadelphia reimbursed insurance companies $650,000 for riot claims , paying off at the rate of 750 on every dollar paid out by the companies . It still has outstanding claims of about $250,000 . California repealed its 95-year-old liability law in 1963 , two years before Watts . Now Californians can collect only by suing the private individual responsible or by proving negligence by individual officers , and suing them instead of the government .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
