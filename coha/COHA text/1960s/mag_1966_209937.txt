After accepting the first Freedom House award ever given to a President while in office , Lyndon Johnson delivered a tersely eloquent restatement of U.S. aims . Excerpts : <P> <P> Wendell Willkie , Franklin Roosevelt 's opponent in the campaign of 1940 , shared his belief that freedom could not be founded only on American shores or only for those whose skin is white . " Freedom is an indivisible word , " Wendell Willkie said . " If we want to enjoy it and fight for it , we must be prepared to extend it to everyone-whether they are rich or poor , whether they agree with us or not ; no matter what their race or the color of their skin . " That was Republican policy 25 years ago . It was Democratic policy 25 years ago . It is American policy tonight . <P> Tonight , in Viet Nam , more than 200,000 of your young Americans stand there fighting for your freedom . But in these last days there have been questions about what we 're doing in Viet Nam . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war for unlimited objectives . The answer is plain . The answer is no . Our purpose in Viet Nam is to prevent the success of aggression . It is not conquest , it is not empire , it is not foreign bases , it is not domination . It is , simply put , just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Viet Nam by North Viet Nam . <P> Some people ask if we are caught in a blind escalation of force that is pulling us headlong toward a wider war that no one wants . The answer-again-is a simple no . We are using that force-and only that force-that is necessary to stop this aggression . Our numbers have increased in Viet Nam because the aggression of others has increased in Viet Nam . There is not , and there will not be , a mindless escalation . <P> Some ask about the risks of a wider war , perhaps against the vast land armies of Red China . And again , the answer is no . We have threatened no one , and we will not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not . Our purpose is solely to defend against aggression . To any armed attack , we will reply . <P> Men ask if we rely on guns alone . Still again , the answer is no . From our Honolulu meeting , from the clear pledge which joins us with our allies in Saigon , there has emerged a common dedication to the peaceful progress of the people of Viet Nam . The pledge of Honolulu will be kept , and the pledge of Baltimore stands open-to help the men of the North when they have the wisdom to be ready . <P> <P> Is It Worth It ? <P> Men ask who has a right to rule in South Viet Nam . Our answer is what it has been here for 200 years : the people must have this right-the South Vietnamese people-and no one else . Washington will not impose a government not of their choice . Hanoi shall not impose a government not of their choice . We will insist for ourselves on what we require from Hanoi : respect for the principle of government by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're neglecting any hopeful chance of peace . And the answer is no . Our undiscouraged efforts will continue . <P> Some ask how long we must bear this burden . And to that question , in all honesty , I can give you no answer tonight . If the aggressor persists in Viet Nam , the struggle may well be long . Our men in battle know and they accept this hard fact . We who are home can do as much .
