When he signed the bill creating the twelfth Cabinet-rank federal agency last month , Lyndon Johnson gave no nod , verbal or cranial , to the man who had worked hardest to create the Administration 's long-sought Department of Transportation . Alan Stephenson Boyd stood stoically aside while the President praised others and declared gratuitously that he was looking for a " strong man " to head DOT . Last week Johnson announced his choice : Alan Boyd , 44 , former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board who , as Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation , had devoted his days since June 1965 to the task of planning and promoting the new department . <P> It was a typical keep-'em-guessing Johnsonian performance .

A combat pilot with more than 3,000 hours of flying time ( World War II and Korea ) , Boyd served successively on state commissions to improve Florida 's aviation , highway and railroad systems . A self-styled " Eisenhower Democrat , " he was summoned to Washington by Ike in 1959 to serve on the CAB .
