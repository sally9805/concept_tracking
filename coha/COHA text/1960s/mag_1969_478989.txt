He was , you understand , always his own man , and when he returned this spring he was still that way , and he still had what is loosely but accurately called the look of eagles in his eyes , and if you insist on asking , Yes , but what is he really like ? , well , he is really like the man John Wayne has been playing in the movies all these years . In fact , Ted Williams talks like John Wayne , and when he walks across the field , wearing his dark blue warm-up jacket and white knickers ( dark on top , light on the bottom , these also being the shades that John Wayne always wears when he is supposed to be the sheriff , or rancher , or whatever ) and pulls his cap over his eyes , and thrusts his hands into his back pockets , then , by God , he is John Wayne . He is , you see , the last of the .400 hitters , and at a time when Carl Yastrzemski was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only .301 , then a .900 hitter is something special , and you might just as well forget that crap about how carefully the pitchers spot the ball these days , and about how much harder it is now to hit . Ted Williams hit the way he did because it was the only thing he wanted to do , and because , he says , " I hit , and hit , and hit , and hit , " and when he was just a kid , breaking in with the Red Sox , he would go back to his apartment , put on a record , and start swinging in time to music . Da-da-da-da-da-WHAP . Da-da-da-da-daWHAP . He would do this to develop a sense of rhythm , and when he stood in right field at Fen-way Park in Boston he would be swinging an imaginary bat and this spring , as the new manager of 74 THE RETURN OF TED WILLIAMS the Washington Senators , he was , at the age of fifty , still swinging an imaginary bat , and swinging it with style and grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . The problem with being your own man , of course , is that you scare everyone else , and in those early days of spring nearly everyone was approaching Ted Williams in fear and trepidation ( although few would admit it , and by mid-season they will have forgotten it ) because how else do you approach a legend , other than nervously ? When the Cincinnati Reds came to Pompano Beach , which is where the Senators pass their spring-times , Johnny Bench , who was the Rookie of the Year in the National League last season , waited outside Williams ' dressing room for a full ten minutes with a baseball that he wanted autographed . " Thank you very much , sir , " he said then to Williams , and Williams said , " Tell me about yourself , " and Bench said , " I throw right , and I hit right , and I 'm a catcher , " and that was all he said . Then , there was the cocky young Senator who said that the first time that Williams got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sideways on Williams where it would hurt , only what he really did when it happened was to say , yes , sir , yes , sir , and hang his head . As everyone knows , Williams was the man who would not tip his hat to the fans , and instead let go at them with a gob of spit , who said bad things about the Boston sportswriters , who , in turn , said bad things about him , and who , angry at a third strike , let go a bat into the stands , whereupon it hit a nice old lady on the conk . " Either he takes to you or he does n't , " a Washington sportswriter said unhappily , suggesting that he had not been taken to , and adding that the consensus was that you had to get right in there with Williams , stand eyeball to eyeball , and plant the zinger on him , bang , or else you would be dismissed . So , one day , planting the zinger on him right away , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? " " Desire and determination , " he said , walking out , and leaving me alone in his dressing room . " How do you recognize desire and determination in a ballplayer ? " I said days later . " You can spot it , " he said , hoisting that imaginary bat . " When a man grips the bat the way he does , you can tell it just the way he stands and looks . " Then he bared his teeth , looked mean , and WHAP , made that lovely , smooth swing . " Or , when a pitcher has a three-and-two count , and he comes down on the batter like he 's jumping at him , " he said , coming down off that imaginary mound , only not like he was just jumping at the batter , but instead maybe stomping him to death , " That 's desire , " he said . Now , the fact is that Ted Williams has had desire all his life , while his new team was not noted for it , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Senators , whomoved to Minneapolis and became the Twins , had regularly stunk out the league , and the new Senators , who first played together in 1961 , had riot greatly improved things . ( Robert E. Short , who paid $9 million for the club last December , denied one day in Pompano Beach that he had hired Williams to make the fans forget the team . " it 's just , " he said , " that we do n't want to remind them of it . " ) So , considering that the Senators were mostly young , lithe , and reasonably well paid , you could not say they were just a collection of meatballs , but considering that they were sixty to one in the winter book to win a pennant , you could not say they were much of a threat to anyone , either . Presumably , Williams wondered from time to time what he was doing there , and presumably he sometimes wished he were somewhere else . Besides , there is a boredom about spring training . Exhibition games do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this spring the weather was lousy . Spring training is a time and a place for little feuds and small jealousies , and by the time a regular season starts , a fair number of people , wives mostly , are not speaking to one another . This time , with Williams in camp , everyone watched and waited . Would he blow ? He had , after all , this fierce reputation , and all over Florida , sportswriters and broadcasters , not to mention fans , were circling him constantly , like gulls over fish , and then darting in , and planting their zingers on him . Hey , Ted , how 's it going ? , this being asked when the team was losing , and losing , and then losing again . Well , the thing about spring training is to get in shape and for the manager to get to know his ballplayers , he would say , sitting in the locker room with his pants off , and wondering when the hell he could get home . Hey , Ted , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manager ? Well , yes , he would say , but I 've got three good coaches , and I 'm willing to learn . Hey , Ted , how about this weather ? , they would say , and he would say , oh , boy , horseshit weather , and then repeat it twice because it was something everyone could agree on . He was , therefore , putting up with stuff and nonsense , and suffering all kinds of people , and then he blew up just a little , and it seemed to do him good . The day after the Senators had lost their eighth straight , this time to the Montreal Expos , Williams called the team together for a meeting . In the Montreal game the right fielder had not run after a ball , and the second baseman had allowed a cut-off throw from the outfield to get away from him , and then had stood and stared at the ball as it skittered away . " I chewed the boys out a little , " Williams said after the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you played like a bunch of sick whores , and goddam , I do n't want to have to give this speech again , Consequently , when he stood by the batting cage that morning and shouted out instructions , he did so cheerfully , as if he had delivered himself of a great burden . " Hey , you left-handed batters , you 're swinging at too many bad pitches . " " Let them think you 're going to bunt , and then Jet ' er rip . " Or , to the pitcher : " Three and two in the ninth in Detroit ? a slider . " ( " See , " he said to the batter , winking as he did so , " I pick the easy parks . " ) " Fire , three and two . " " Fast ball , three and two . " Then a hot prospect from California stepped up . He was eighteen years old , and a catcher , and his father , who was a Little League coach , wanted $100.000 for him to sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact stance , and when he swung he hit a fence 350 feet away . " He looks like Yastrzemski , " a man said . " Now goddam , why did n't I see that ? You 're absolutely right . You 're absolutely right , " Williams said happily . A couple of left-handed hitters walked up , and Williams said , " Everybody says the hands and wrists are important , do n't they ? Now do n't they ? " The left-handed hitters said yes . " But look , " Williams said , and pssshhh , he went , making a noise , and swinging that imaginary bat again . " Look at my wrists . What are they doing ? " ( In fact , he had not broken his wrists at all , but had brought that imaginary bat around in a fine , smooth arc . ) " Look , " he said , and went pssshhh again , " it 's all in the hips and ass . " Soon , about eight Senators had flopped at his feet , or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree With that ? " Williams said to an infielder who had never hit more than .229 in his life . No , the infielder said . " Now , Joe Gordon , he wants his team to hit differently , " Williams said , talking about the old Yankee infielder who now managed the Kansas City Royals . " He wants them to use their wrists . Shit , " he said , " it ca n't be done . " It is a fact that that afternoon the Senators went out and won for the first time , beating the Atlanta Braves , 18 to 5 , and that a Senator who had hit only three home runs all last season hit exactly that many in the game . " Well , " Ted said evenly , " that ought to give us a lift . " Then he called batting practice again . 44=1 ootball players , basketball players , politicians , astronauts , soldiers , sailors ? you name them , anyone ? and the ones least prepared to talk to you guys are young ballplayers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sportswriters , and all the while never taking his eyes off what was happening on the field . " You can make them look so had , and they do n't know how to deal with you . You can make them look foolish . " Williams sounded as if he had been brooding on it , which he almost certainly had . " MacArthur was my greatest idol , " he said on another morning . " He was unquestionably one of the greatest men who ever lived . I thought that even when I was in Korea . MacArthur was above it all . People say now that they liked and admired him , and they say , ' Yeah , we agree with you about him . ' But they could have had him for President , and instead they choose that smiley Irishman ? Eisenhower . Everything MacArthur did was great and right , and he was n't a politician . He was above it all . Another hero I had was Herbert Hoover . I thought he was as persecuted a man as I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been right all along , and I think the people knew it . " Williams , as a rule , does not care for politicians , considering them to be for the most part nefarious sidewinders , and baseball people , as a rule , do not talk much about politics , although Williams has twice campaigned for Richard Nixon . " I got addicted to Nixon the first time I met him , when he was Vice President , " Williams said . " He showed me a genuineness you never see in politicians . The press had been taking potshots at him ? Cronkite , Huntley , Brinkley ? and they do n't like him , I know , and now they 're eating their words . " Whether or not this is true about the men on television , it is unquestionably true that many people took potshots at MacArthur and Hoover ( often for what they considered the best of reasons ) and that Williams admires embattled men just as he admires the ability to be above it all , To be above it all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , even if it is just the caterwauling of fans and sportswriters , and when Williams returned to baseball he did so after having spent the best part of his retirement fishing in the Florida keys . " I saw only twelve games in the last eight years , plus a few on television , " he said , which might have meant that he just did n't care enough to see more , except that then he talked about how much he loved to fish , bonefish in the summer and salmon in the fall , and about how fishing " eased the pain a little . " In fact , Williams loves baseball , where , he once told a friend , " I count for something , " and he is one of its folk heroes . " Ted , " I said , " why do you think all those reporters and television people want to talk to your " Probably because they 're tired of writing about the next guy , " he said . 76 THE RETURN OF TED WILLIAMS " Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aw , " he said . Nonetheless , it can he rewarding to be a folk hero in America , and the best speculation around the Senators ' camp was that Williams , who knows a thing or two about money , never having quite got over the fact that one of Joseph P. Kennedy 's people advised him to sell short in 1950 , would get about a million dollars , with stock options , to sign up for an indeterminate time as manager . Moreover , when Bob Short , the new owner of the Senators , began to promote the club he naturally found himself promoting Williams . " FREE ! A duplicate of the pen Ted used to sign baseball 's hottest contract ! " the order blank said . " Mail your season ticket order before April 1 , 1969 , and you will receive this appropriately imprinted duplicate of the marking pen Ted used to sign his return to baseball ? FREE ! Display it as a rare memento of a great moment in Washington 's the nation 's . . . sports history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ticket holders , as against the 500 who subscribed last season , were offering Executive Plan I , Executive Plan II , the Night Owl Plan , Pick-A-Date Certificate Plan and the Sunday-Holiday Plan , all of which cost a fair amount of money , and all of which were made more attractive by little reminders that said , " Baseball Tickets Are A Legitimate Federal Tax Deduction ! " Mr. Short , in fact , is an honest man , and his supplications to subscribers , which had pictures of Ted at the top , said that " for too many years the Senators have been last artistically and financially . They have never been able to win enough games , attract enough fans , merit rights fees from radio and TV . Even in peanut and popcorn receipts the club does not measure up to major-league competitors . " ( " The old owner , " a Washington pitcher said sadly , " just used me for a tax write-off . " ) Besides , the Senators have a kind of Negro Problem . Robert F. Kennedy Memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghetto , which frightens suburbanites away , and then does not compensate by turning out enough black fans . It is a great headache , and Mr. Short briefly considered hiring a Negro manager , and then thought of getting a Negro coach , and finally decided to just go all the way with Williams . Whether Williams will save the franchise for Washington is problematic . An old friend , once a pitcher , says that " Ted 's problem is patience , not in a single game , but over a whole season . Along about August , when he 's stuck in last place , he could just say , ' To hell with it , ' and head on back to Florida . " It is possible , of course , just as it is possible that he will head on back to Florida as soon as he can beat the capital-gains tax on his stock options , or even that Bob Short , growing disenchanted , will tell him to head on back to Florida . ( The last may be least likely- . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone call from Williams . " The new owner is a jock worshipper , " an intelligent Senator said , not at all unkindly . ) Still , the most certain thing about Williams is that he 'll try , by God , which is what he has been doing , even if not always successfully , since he was a child . He was born in 1918 in San Diego to a mother who was a Salvation Army lassie , and to a father , a photographer , who was not home much , either . The thing about San Diego , though , was that it had the North Park playground , a block and a half from where the Williamses lived , and that it had lights , and that you could hit there until nine o'clock at night . When Williams was not there , or in school , he was working the street corners with his mother , hating it , and standing behind the big bass drum so that he could not he seen . He was a lousy student , terrified of girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . However , in his last two years at Hoover High , from which he did not graduate , he hit .583 and .406 . A scout from the St. Louis Cardinals , who saw his last game , said soberly that a season of professional ball would kill a tense , shy kid who stood six feet three inches and weighed only 145 pounds , but the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League signed him in 1936 for $150 a month , and the rest , as they say , is legend . After two seasons in San Diego and one at Minneapolis in the American Association , where he once put his fist through a big water cooler after he had popped up with the bases loaded , he came up with the Red Sox . He had been there briefly before , lasting about a week , and distinguishing himself chiefly because he called everyone , including older and wiser heads , " Sport . " In return , he became " The Kid " to nearly everyone else , and he might not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Sox general manager , was convinced that he could be the world 's greatest hitter . A man who was there says that when Williams finally did get up to Boston to stay , everyone hung around while he took a long , Tong batting practice , parking six balls over the right-field fence , and that Joe Cronin , the manager , turned to Collins and said , " Eddie , you 're right . " In his first season Williams hit .327 , and in his second it was .344 , and then came 1941 , when he hit .406 . Still , when you make it big you always have problems of one sort or another , and Williams ' was a remarkable sensitivity , not to mention a tendency to throw bats , kick posts in the dugout , and maybe rip out the plumbing , or tear out the lights . ( " When I get scared I get mad , " he said not long ago , and while this had to do with the time his plane crashed in Korea , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting thought , nonetheless . ) The other problem was the Boston sportswriters . A respectable sportswriter will tell you that there is at least as much inventive junk on the sports pages as anywhere in the paper , and when Williams played in Boston there was probably more , which is truly impressive when you consider that until fairly recently the Boston papers were absolutely rotten . Once a paper sent a private detective to San Diego to see if Williams really did support his mother , and once a paper polled people on whether he would make a decent father to his new daughter . That kind of thing . Williams , meanwhile , was going pretty good himself , once making a nice dirty gesture to the crowd , spitting a few times in the direction of the press box , and occassionally at the fans ( the writers got to writing about the " great expectorations " ) and never , never tipping his hat . There were things of another kind , too , and the best one happened when he was in a slump at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go he was hitting something over .400 , and Manager Cronin offered to keep him on the bench , reasoning that he would not then lose that .400 average . Besides , the Yankees had won the pennant , as they nearly always did in those years , and the Red Sox games meant nothing . No , Williams said , I will keep on playing . Came the last day of the season , and Williams had slipped to .39955 , which would round out to exactly .400 , and Cronin offered again . I will keep you out of the lineup , he said , and you will be the first American League player to hit .400 since George Sisler did it in 1922 . No , Williams said again , I will do it the hard way , or not at all . That day it was cold and leaden , dreadful , the kind of day Williams despised , and there were two games at Philadelphia . Stay loose , kid , the plate umpire was mumbling when Williams stepped up to bat . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home run . Then he got two more singles . In the second game he got two hits , one of them denting the loudspeaker in right field . Williams says he does not remember what he did that night to celebrate , but that he thinks he might have gone out and got a milkshake . At the end of the next season , there being a war on , he went into naval aviation . He did not go in to do anything you might expect a dropout from Hoover High to do , but to be a pilot , and when he had trouble with celestial navigation he got a tutor , mastered it , and finished near the top of his class . Later , he set a gunnery record , flying in from different angles and hitting a target 99 out of 100 times with his machine guns , Back at the ball park in 1946 he was old Terrible Ted again , and soon he was hitting the pitchers again as if he owned them , and doing things again that , depending on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish . ( In the first inning of the All-Star Game in 1950 , he crashed into the left-field wall , fractured an elbow , and still stayed on 78 THE RETURN OF TED WILLIAMS through the ninth inning . ) Then , in 1952 , he was recalled as a Marine pilot , flying thirty-nine combat missions in Korea , becoming permanently embittered at politicians and the Selective Service system they had made , and losing two of his best years . After that , things were never quite right physically for Williams ; he broke bones , damaged tendons , and caught colds , but all the while doing spectacular things for a ballplayer going on forty , one of which was hitting .388 at the age of thirty-nine . In 1959 , however , it looked if he had had it . He was , after all , forty-one years old , and that spring he pinched a nerve in his neck . He was barely able to turn toward the pitcher , and all year he hovered around .250 . When he finished at .254 , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided to stay on one more season because , he says , he just could n't , go out at .254 . The next year he hit .316 , and in his final game , when the Red Sox played Baltimore at . Fenway Park , he came to bat in the eighth inning for what he and everyone else knew would be the last time and hit a home run . Of course , a kind of delirium set in then among the 10,454 people who were there that day , and of course he did not tip his hat . " Only two ballplayers ever went out gracefully ? Mr. Cobb and Mr. Williams ? and no one else ever went out doing anywhere near what they were doing , " Williams was saying . He was standing with one foot on a locker-room bench , patting his sweatshirt over the shadow of a paunch , and chewing a stalk of celery . In the next room his ballplayers were pulling on cleats , buttoning up shirts , or staring silently at their own crotches . Williams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball park , and whereas his team was dressing calmly and deliberately , he was doing it purposefully . The day before , his first baseman had been picked up for driving a car with temporary plates . The car had been seized , and the cops had been rude , and when Wilhams heard about it he had told the first baseman that when anything like that happened , for Chris-sake , to tell the team . The first baseman had been impressed , saying , " This would n't have happened before , " and the other ballplayers , when they heard about it , had been impressed , too . Williams was trying to show them that , yes , they really were a team , which is one way to build desire and determination . Another is to keep talking , which is what Williams did while he sat with them in the dugout during the games . He would talk about the war between the pitcher and the batter , and sometimes he would whirl on someone and ask him what the count was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who had just struck out , he would say , " What kind of pitch was that ? " and the man had better know , or else Williams would say , " Well , why do n't you know ? " The thing about Williams is that he will know , and even if he does not , he will still look as if he does . He probably can not help it , the look is just there , and I think Douglas MacArthur had it , too . At the age of fifty , Ted Williams has , among other things , a third wife , who was supposed to get the part of Pussy Galore in Goldflnger ( which gives you some idea of what her look is like ) , about 8,000 acres in cotton and cattle in Florida . a boys ' camp in Massachusetts , a portfolio , a part-time executive 's job with Sears , and membership in the baseball Hall of Fame . He is what he is , and he acknowledges it . " Ted , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " then I wo n't have to look at your face again . " Then we talked . " I 've never had a house big enough , " he said . " No , the first one was big , but my first wife got it . Someday I want to build a place big enough for my things ? my trophies and stuff . I 'm convinced I 'll never have enough money to do everything I want to do ? fish , hunt , read biographies . Someday I 'd like to have a big shrimper-type yacht so that I could hunt and fish in remote areas anywhere . " " Say , " he said , " are you sure you 're going tomorrow ? " " Yes , " I said . " Well , that 's good news , " he said . ( Say it ai n't so , Ted , I thought . ) " The thing that made me a good hitter , " he said , " was that no one ever wanted to hit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as much as I did . I tried to improve as much as I could . It was my whole life . It was the only thing I wanted to do . " I 'm surprised there 's so much commotion about my coming here . I 've had to spend all my time being interviewed , and with crap like that , I have no time for anything else . I went home last night , and there was a friend there , and Christ , we watched the news un television and I was ready to fall asleep . " Then , because he always operates that way , he started to ask questions , wanting to know if I had hunted , fished , or played sports , and whether I thought Castro was truly intelligent , and since he knew that I had been there , what was it really like in Cuba . " Look , " he said then , " you 're honestly going tomorrow . " " Yes , " I said . " Great , and take your friends with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator was hit in the elbow by a pitch , Ted Williams walked partway from the dugout to home plate , and stood there just a moment to see if his man was hurt . He was not , and when Williams turned to walk back a fan on the third-base line called , " Hey , Ted come on , how about a smile ? " Williams shook his head , and kept staring at the ground , but he was smiling , by God , he was really smiling .
