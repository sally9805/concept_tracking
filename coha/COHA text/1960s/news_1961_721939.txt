txt The British Government will draw a substantial sum from the International Monetary Fund as part of its emergency measures to strengthen the pound and correct un- ' favorable economic trends . This move , confirmed by authoritative sources today , should kill rumors that the pound may be devalued . These rumors have recurred time and again despite repeated Government declarations that it could and would defend the sterling 's value . Britain . has - drawing rights with the fund of nearly $2,500 , - 000,000 . In addition to the actual drawing , she is expected to ask for and receive a large stand-by credit on which she could call at any time . At least part of the funds drawn will be used to purchase sterling held by central banks on the Continent under what has come to be known as the Basle agreement . Central Banks to Aid The details of this under-1 standing have never been pub-1 lished . But broadly speaking it is an agreement by the central banks to hold a currency when it is under pressure and its conversion into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount that Britain will draw from the International Monetary Fund and the standby credit she will seek are being kept secret . In the crisis month of December , 1956 , Britain drew $561 , - 000,000 , which she has since repaid : She also received then a stand-by credit , which she never used . That credit was equal to the rest of her quota , which then was $1,300,000,000 . Sterling is ; already strengthening in foreign ' exchanges . Speculators are com- ; mg to realize that the pound will ! not be devalued . They expect ; that tough measures to be an-i pounced by the Government next ' Tuesday will stabilize the econ- ; omy . These measures and the gen-I eral economic situation were , the subject of a debate in the ! House of Commons today . In it , Laborites lashed the Conserva- , tive Government for having failed to correct Britain 's eco- , nomic ills and for having encouraged an unwarranted complacency to further its political . ends . Censure Move Beaten When the debate ended , the Laborites offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government . The measure was , beaten on a party-line vote of ; 329 to 243 , a Government majority of 86 . Hugh Gaitskell , Labor party leader , said the immediate reason for the crisis was the run on sterling . This , he said , has led to a sharp drop in Britain 's reserves of gold and convertible currencies . The drop would have been even sharper , he said , except for the support-of central banks . One reason for the run , he said , was the " massive " deficit in Britain 's balance of payments over the last eighteen , months . This deficit meant Brit-1 ain was spending more abroad than she was earning . Mr. Gaitskell told the Commons that there was conclusive evidence that , in comparison with other industrial nations , Britain was doing poorly in the rate of expansion of her production and exports . He said there was a widespread conviction that Britain was failing to compete with other countries in proauctivity , ! design , salesmanship and price ' both in the home market and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound lack of confidence in ' the future of sterling . It may be said that Britain 's ' failure to sell more abroad is. because of too rapid expansion , at home , he continued . But ac-i tually , he said , the record of economic growth at home was ' just as bad as the export record. , He urged the Chancellor of the Exchequer not to give the , country the " old dreary collection of expedients " such as a rise in the bank rate , cuts in public investments and other expenditures , and restrictions on installment buying . Some of these may be neces- ' , sary , he said , but what is needed ' is broad economic planning , a higher degree of professionalism in business and exporting , greater frankness by the Government and a change " in the whole climate of opinion in the country . " " A great attack has to be made on the soggy complacency of some managements and the appalling indifference of some workers , " he declared . Selwyn Lloyd , Chancellor of ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain had sustained a defense program and an overseas aid effort that had made heavy demands on her economy . " I do not minimize for a ; moment our difficulties or the effort that will be needed to ! deal with them , but I think ; we should not approach them ) in a spirit of gloom , pessimism and defeatism , " he declared .
