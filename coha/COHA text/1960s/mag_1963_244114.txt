A Ticklish Affair is unlikely to tickle anybody who is not addicted to an old Hollywood plot-boy meets girl 's kiddies . Three lads want to find a husband for Mommy , a Navy widow ( Shirley Jones ) . One day they flash a semaphoric SOS from their bedroom window toward the naval base across the bay , succeed in alerting a considerable portion of the U.S. Navy . When a suitably goodhearted , simple-minded commander ( Gig Young ) comes jeeping to the house , the boys look him over , decide he is just the man for Mommy . From then on , the story cruises so predictably that viewers may get an uneasy feeling of having somewhere , somehow , seen the movie before . <P> <P> A main ingredient of this formula is the rescue : one of the kids gets into some dire difficulty and is saved by the prospective groom . When Uncle Red Buttons brings over a lot of surplus weather balloons and rigs up a harness so the boys can try gravity-free " moon-walking , " little Grover ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego and out to sea . Instantly , much of Southern California is in a state of emergency . An aircraft carrier , a fire engine , a fleet of patrol boats , an LST , swarms of helicopters , jets and amphibian planes , an ambulance , police cars and a posse of excitable civilians mobilize into an armada of ineptitude . Finally Gig commandeers a blimp , has himself lowered on a life raft , grabs the flyaway as he floats by . <P> But how to hoist those big balloons up through the hatch of the blimp ? Nobody thinks of cutting the strings and letting the balloons just drift away as Gig holds on to Grover . Instead , Buttons takes a rifle and plugs the balloons one by one while hanging from the blimp by his belt . Eventually the last balloon goes splop-psssssssss . And so does the movie .
