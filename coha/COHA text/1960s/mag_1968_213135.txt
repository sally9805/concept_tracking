KING , QUEEN , KNAVE by Vladimir Nabokov. 272 pages . McGraw-Hill. $5.95 . <P> <P> This is Vladimir Nabokov 's second novel , written and published in Russian in 1928 , when he was a 28-year-old migr living in Berlin . It was recently roughed into English by Nabokov 's son Dmitri , then tightened and buffed to a cold brilliance by the author . " Of all my novels , " says Nabokov , " this bright brute is the gayest . Expatriation , destitution , nostalgia had no effect on its elaborate and rapturous composition . " <P> Actually , his later novels , notably Lolita and Pale Fire , are far more elaborate . Even Laughter in the Dark ( originally published in 1932 as Camera obscurd ) , which in setting , plot and theme strongly resembles King , Queen , Knave , is more intricately patterned . But King , Queen , Knave is tricky enough-the ap-pearance-and-reality theme as applied to the eternal love triangle . In Nabokov 's idiosyncratic geometry , all three angles are obtuse : Kurt Dreyer , fiftyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jocular egomania ; Martha , his 34-year-old wife , beautiful and sybaritic , is dimmed by compulsively romantic restlessness and anticipation ; Franz , Dreyer 's youthful nephew and employee , is a myopic , precariously balanced bumpkin . <P> Dreyer and Franz occasionally attempt to squirm out of the two-dimensional plane in which Nabokov holds them captive . But most of the time , all three are as flat and glossy as the playing cards suggested by the novel 's title . This enables Nabokov to give them the nimble shuffle that characterizes the mercurial plots of all his Action . <P> <P> Lifeless Lump . Franz first encounters his uncle and aunt accidentally in a train compartment . They are unaware of his identity , as he is of theirs . Not a word is exchanged between him and them during the entire trip from his small home town to Berlin , where he will work in his uncle 's department store . Dreyer idly casts a professional eye over the young spectacled passenger , sizing him up by the low quality of his haberdashery . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than a lifeless lump . <P> Nabokov lingers over the coincidence of the encounter , but his timing is nearly perfect . By drawing it out , he sharpens the anticipation of the impending adultery ; before long , Martha , the frosty doll , and Franz , promoted from lifeless lump to " warm and pliant wax , " ca n't get enough of each other . <P> The affair thrives , despite burlesqued escapes from detection , and Martha evolves a plan to drown Dreyer , inherit his millions and marry Franz . " My dining room , my earrings , my silver , my Franz , " she muses . Martha , in fact , is so greedy that she aborts the murder plot at the last moment because her husband remarks that he is about to fatten his estate with $100,000 from the sale of a patent for mechanical mannequins . The appearance of these " automanne-quins " raises the question of who is real and who is not-one of those Nabokovian diversions that in later novels are more subtly conceived , often with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
