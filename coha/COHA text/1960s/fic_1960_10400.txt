rabbit from a tangle of bushes . He was now feeling against his side the same pathetic , spasmodic shudders of fear . The sooner we clear out of here , the better , he thought as he listened to the elevator . The woman had entered it . He could hear it droning its way up again . Katherini said , " She is coming here ! " " Who ? " " My aunt . She 's coming . . . . " The whisper died away , hopeless , and left Strang and Cecilia staring at each other . " No . Not here , " he said , as he heard the elevator stop . It had not traveled far , only to the second floor . Demetrius Drakon , he remembered , and took a deep breath of relief as the elevator was sent down once more . I 'll call it back up here , he thought , as soon as it reaches the hall . We 'll get the hell out . He looked at Thomson 's solid door ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the house he lived in . But , at that moment , the door opened . Tommy stood there , wrapped in a heavy dressing gown , his white hair ruffled into a startled fuzz around his head , his red face frowning , his light-blue eyes wary , his hand gripped round a heavy walking stick . " Wondered who was whispering on my door mat , " he began , relaxing . Strang made an instinctive gesture for silence and , although the surprised Tommy could hardly be expected to understand , pointed downward to the second floor . But Tommy at least understood the urgency of the pointed hand . He looked at Strang , then he looked at Cecilia , then at the white face of the girl . He stepped back , opening his door wide . " Come in , come in , " he said irritably . " Ca n't have her fainting out there ! "  |p201Tommy  had n't been asleep . He had n't even been in bed . His comfortablydented armchair , with a footstool in front , a reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level on which a pot of tea , a large cup , an opened book face down , reading glasses , pipe , and massive ash tray were lying , showed he was a long-established bachelor with his own agreeable answer for insomnia . Everything in the room was dark and crowded , worn and comfortable : a woman 's nightmare , and a man 's delight . It was a solid little place , secure , permanent , with its walls covered with memories of old friends in framed photos and bookcases . Nothing changed much here , unless another book was jammed into a packed shelf , another magazine added to the piles that covered solid , dark tables , another enlarged snapshot inserted among the mosaic of frames on the wall . Armchairs and sofa looked as if they had been enjoyed for years , their plush covering worn threadbare . The blue velvet curtaining the windows had faded into streaks of slate gray , and one of its long panels was pulled back , with more practicality than grace , to jam a glass door half open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipe smoke out of the room . Hence the heavy dressing gown , Cecilia thought , and decided to keep her coat on . For a moment , she let her eye follow Kenneth Strang as he went forward to the opened door among the windows . Then she heard Katherini 's sharp choke on the smidgen of brandy that Tommy was letting trickle between the girl 's lips , and she turned back to the sofa with her questions still unasked . Strang glanced outside and saw a narrow terrace , a balustrade ,  |p202and  then the yawn of street . He stepped quietly through the opened door and looked cautiously down into the street . The car had gone . It looked as if Madame Etienne Duval planned to stay some time . Opposite him , the houses were dark and asleep . Their owners had n't Tommy 's reading habits . Strang stepped back into the room , closing the door enough to let the curtain fall over it more adequately . Katherini was now sitting up on the sofa , Cecilia beside her , Tommy standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of complete astonishment , which he was trying very hard , and most politely , to control . Cecilia was saying , " She 's in danger . She 's a  --  a refugee . " " Oh ? " Tommy waited . " We 've been trying to help her . And we came here because you  --  well , we do n't know many people , and you 're the only one we felt we could trust . " " Indeed , " said Tommy , but he softened a little . I 'll keep out of this , Strang decided , and glanced into the little hall where they had entered the apartment . I 'll leave it all to those beautiful eyes ; they have a truth in them that words ca n't compete with . " Because , " Cecilia was saying , " Ken said you know what it is to be hunted . And Katherini is being hunted . Could we hide her here , just for half an hour ? It 's a dreadful imposition , I know . But please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find shelter ... . " Hm ! " Tommy said , and then whirled around on Strang as he re-entered the room . " Have you quite finished your tour of inspec-tion ? " " I 'm sorry , " Strang said . He decided to be completely frank . " I was just making sure that we could n't be overlooked or overheard . " This apartment was certainly compact . Out in the hall , he had found a small bathroom next to a minuscule kitchen , and a door which he had guessed would lead to the bedroom . " There 's a high window in the kitchen . Is that for ventilation or a view ? " " Ventilation . " " And the door in the kitchen  --  that 's the service entrance ? " " Naturally , " Tommy said a little acidly . " Is there a back staircase , or is it a service elevator ? " Tommy 's most perceptive eyes were studying Strang 's face . He answered , at last , " A staircase . Which leads down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very respectable woman with two children , all fast asleep , I am sure . You need n't worry so much.  |p203The  front door is locked , the back door is bolted and barred , as you no doubt saw . And the high window in the kitchen is closed . You are perfectly safe here . " " Thank you . " It looked as if Tommy would n't turn them away . But there was still one small worry . " Could anyone getting out of the elevator at the second floor have heard you speak to us ? " He waited anxiously . Tommy 's eyes and voice softened . " Dear me , you are in trouble , are n't you ? No . The lift does n't conduct any noises . It makes quite enough by itself when it 's in action . " He pointed to one end wall of the sitting room . " It 's just through there , blast it . But it does warn me to expect visitors . Except , of course , they usually telephone from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Strang for a moment . " We had n't time . A car arrived just as I was about to call you . There was a woman  --  " Katherini 's hands went to her lips . She turned her head away , for a moment . Tommy 's eyes flickered back again to Strang . Strang said , " We heard her take the elevator to the second floor . By that time , we were huddled outside your door , afraid even to ring the bell in case she heard it . " " The second floor ? " Tommy was surprised . " To Michalopoulos ? But how extraordinary  --  I mean , at this hour ! " He glanced , in sudden confusion , at the two girls . " Michalopoulos is on the second floor ? " Strang asked . " Of course . And a more respectable , retired wool merchant would be hard to find . " Tommy grinned over his own thoughts . Strang was n't sharing them . He was watching Katherini now . The name of Michalopoulos had had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never heard of anyone called Michalopou-los ? " She shook her head . Tommy said , " I know what you need  --  a nice cup of tea . " Cecilia said , " Or soup ? If you have any , that is . I do n't think Katherini has had much to eat today . " " Soup ! " Tommy looked doubtful and a little upset . " I 'm rather afraid  --  or would Bovril do ? And lots of bread and butter ? I do have that . " " Wonderful ! " Cecilia rose . " I 'll put water on to boil , " she said , and went into the hall toward the kitchen . Katherini struggled to her feet to follow.  | " No , no , " Strang said gently . " You rest here . This is Mr. Thorn . son . He is English , but he has lived here most of his life . He is a very good friend of Greece . " The girl looked at them both . Then she sat down obediently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strang looked at her , aghast . " I 'd better get Cecilia  --  " " Leave her , " Tommy said quickly , drawing Strang toward his armchair . " She 'd much rather we did n't even notice , " he whispered . " Pull in that chair , wo n't you ? Now , tell me  --  what 's all this commotion ? " He settled himself in his chair , picked up his pipe to prod its ashes with his finger , while he watched Strang carefully . Strang looked at the telephone , hesitated , and decided to talk to Tommy first . This invasion deserved a little explanation . He said quickly , " The girl is running away from her aunt . The aunt is involved in a political intrigue , a very nasty mess , and the girl wants no more of it . " There , he thought with relief , is the truth and no secrets divulged , either . " That does n't sound too desperate , " Tommy said , knocking the ashes out of his pipe and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end in a mess of some kind , I find . " " These particular politics start off where most other political troubles end . " " Indeed ? What are they ? " Tommy 's interest had sharpened . " Fascistor Communist ? " " As far as I can make out , her aunt belongs to a group that is a terrorist faction of Communists . That is , they are definitely leftist , not rightist . But they are so far to the left that they 've written off Tito as a bourgeois reactionary and they think Khrushchev  --  except for his action in Hungary  --  may be going the same way . When they talk of revolution , they mean revolution . " " Ah  --  one of those extremist groups , " Tommy said , with the equanimity of someone who had spent too many years in the Balkansto be astounded by political intensity . " They always are so set on remaking the world in their own unpleasant image . I ca n't think why . " His pipe was drawing , nicely , at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crouching forward on the edge of the sofa , her elbows on her knees , her hands covering her face . " And just what kind of political intrigue were we talking about ? " Strang looked embarrassed . He tried to search for a few careful phrases.  | " All right , all right , " Tommy said testily , letting him off that hook . He drew at his pipe , frowning , his curiosity increased . But he would ask no more questions . Strang glanced at his watch . " May I use your phone ? I 've been trying to get in touch with one of the attaches at our embassy here . Last time I telephoned , he had several people at his apartment . I 've been waiting until they have all left . I do n't want to take Katherini to his place until I 'm sure of that . " He crossed quickly over to the telephone , aware that Katherini was watching him . Then he put down the receiver , cursing silently as the only answer to his call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face again . " You seem to be taking this very seriously . " " It is serious . In the last few days , one man has been murdered , another has been kidnaped and  --  unless he has escaped  --  will be murdered , too . This girl was hunted all over Athens tonight . If she is caught  --  she will be silenced . Yes , I think we can take this all quite seriously . " Tommy 's equanimity was gone . " Good heavens ! " he said . He added , angrily , " And what on earth are you doing dragging Miss Hillard into all this ? " Strang said sharply , " Do n't start thinking that Cecilia is n't one of my chief worries . " He picked up the receiver again . And , again , there was that damned go-away , drop-dead signal . He said angrily to Tommy , " Sure I 'm to blame , but all this is none of my choosing . Everything is breaking so fast ... . " He calmed down , added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a conspiracy . It has been organizing itself for months , if not years  --  careful recruiting , planning , preparation , complete secrecy . And in a few days , I walked bang slap right into the middle of it . " He took a deep breath , searched for his cigarettes , found one left in a crumpled pack , straightened it , and lit it . " Tonight , believe it or not , Miss Hillard and I just went out to dinner . That 's all . To dinner . Afterward , we went to a little place where we could hear some Greek music . Instead  --  " he halted , as he looked over at KatheriniRoilos . She was watching them , listening . " Well , that 's the way the tide runs , " he said to Tommy . Tommy rose . " You look like a man who needs something stronger than Bovril . " He went over to a cupboard in a bookcase , and took out his one bottle of Scotch . " And I think I 'll join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual night . " He looked around  |p206vaguely  . " Glasses . . . water ... just one moment . " He left for the kitchen . Katherini said , her large eyes two dark hollows in her white face , " I am trouble . Trouble for everyone . " " Nonsense , " he said awkwardly . " Why do you help me ? " He stared at her in surprise . " You did n't expect us to leave you wandering around Athens by yourself , did you ? " " Because you need me ? Is what I know so valuable that you put yourself and your girl and the old Englishman in danger ? " " Look  --  " he began patiently , and glanced over his shoulder for help . What had kept Cecilia so long ? From the kitchen came the cheerful rumble of Tommy 's voice and Cecilia 's laugh . " But you are n't Greek . Why do you help me ? " " You 're someone very much in need of help . That 's enough . Is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria in need of help , " she said . " Maria ? " " You do n't even remember who she is ! " she said angrily . He remembered now . " Of course I do . Your maid . But look , Katherini , one person at a time ! First you , then Maria . And there 's Steve , too . Remember him ? There is a lot of help needed tonight . " She said slowly , " Is Maria still alive ? She may still be in that house . " The worry in her voice was mounting . " She may be hurt . Alone . " " Now , Katherini , " he said , " you calm down , and let me put thiscall through . That 's the quickest way to get help for both you andMaria . " He had his hand on the telephone . " Where is that house ? " " You will tell your friends where to go and find her ? " " That 's why I 'm asking for the address , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plaka . " That was the last place he had expected to hear . He said , unable to conceal his surprise , " Your aunt has a house down in the Plaka ? " " It is n't her house . That 's what she always does . In New York , inMexico City . " " Always does what ? " " She gets a friend to lease a house . Then she borrows it . This one , in Athens , is in Kriton Street . It is all  --  all made like new . I do n't know the number . But it is big , and it is painted in the color ofp207rich cream . And the shutters are of chocolate brown . There is a garden at the side , and a high white wall . " " And a door with steps in front and carved decorations overhead ? " he asked quickly . " You know it ? " Her eyes widened . " Then you can find Maria and  --  " " Who was the man who left there , tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving only the chill of unpleasant realization . She would n't admit she did n't know . " Boris ? " she asked . " No . It was n't the little Bulgarian . It was n't Nikos , either . And it was n't the man who drove with Nikos in the green car  --  what 's his name ? " " Andreas . It was n't Andreas ? " " No . Who ? " He waited for her to say the name and wished he were five thousand miles away , back in New York . " Then it was Metsos . He is dark , thin , quite tall . Very serious . Very important . " And so were a thousand men . " Have you ever heard the name of Christophorou ? " " And who is he ? " she asked . " If it were not Nikos , not Boris , not Andreas , then it was Metsos  --  Metsos Drakon . He used to visit my aunt in Syria . Long long ago , during the war , she knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my aunt was Elektra , and Nikos was Sideros . They use these names still , among themselves . " " Then they are all old friends ? " " They have always worked together . My aunt was a courier in the war  --  she carried messages from Athens into the mountains . That was before she was married . " Katherini paused . Then she said proudly , " Do you know how dangerous it was to be a courier ? My aunt was a very great heroine , a patriot , during the war against the Nazis . " Strang looked at the girl . " I 'm sure she was , " he said slowly . But had she fought so well before June , 1941 , and the invasion of Russia ? That was the date no one should forget when they talked of heroes and heroines and staunch allies . Before June , 1941 , it had been an imperialist war . After that , a holy crusade . So how did one measure such a patriot ? The kind of patriot who needed clearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for his country ? " I do not like the way you said that , " she said angrily . " Womenp208can be as brave as men . Braver . The world would have died long ago if men had to produce the children . " " No doubt about it , " he told her with a grin . " Now let 's get back to Kriton Street . In whose name was the house rented for your aunt ? " Cecilia and Tommy were coming back into the room with a loaded tray . " Evgenia Vasilika . " Katherini 's indignation had subsided . She added , almost listlessly , " She came to Nauplion to meet my aunt . " " That woman ! " Tommy burst out . He put the heavy tray down , to let him concentrate on Evgenia Vasilika . " That woman is a friend of your aunt 's ? " A raw nerve end had been touched : now , he was quite prepared to believe the worst about such an aunt . He looked at Katherini with evident sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherini to calm down and eat something ? She wo n't listen to me . " He walked back to the telephone . Katherini was watching him . " You tell them about Maria ? " she asked sharply . Strang looked at her . " Yes , " he said , and picked up the receiver . " I see what you mean , " Cecilia murmured , and lifted two cups of steaming brown liquid . At that moment , the sound of a car came gently humming into the room from the quiet street . The engine was easing to a careful halt . Too careful . Strang moved swiftly . He jammed the receiver back on the telephone , switched off the light , pulled aside the heavy folds of velvet , stepped onto the terrace . " Oh ! " Cecilia said softly , left standing in the dark in a strange room with two scalding cups in her hands . " Ken does choose his moments , does n't he ? " " Keep very still , " Tommy 's anxious voice warned her unnecessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car stopping below my window ? " No one answered him . He fell silent , too , staying close to the lamp , his hand ready to switch on the light as soon as the mac ! American stopped playing little games . But , " Sh ! " he found himselfsaying as the first drag of the elevator 's cables sounded through the end wall of the room . Can I really be taking this seriously ? Tommy wondered . Certainly he found he was listening carefully . " Someone for Drakon , this time , " he announced cheerfully , and then stared at the sofa in sudden amazement as he heard a terrifying , small , half-strangled cry of fear.  | " Now what did I do ? " Tommy was demanding , switching on the light quickly as Strang stepped back into the room , closed the door , and pulled the curtains together . " I only said that was someone for Drakon , this time . " He looked in amazement at the frightened Katherini . " At least , I 'm pretty sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , Strang , you are making me behave as oddly as you . Counting lift stops ! " He humphed with pretended indignation and handed a glass of Scotch and water to Strang . " Have your drink and calm down , my dear fellow . Let us all calm down . " He looked at Katherini , and nodded approvingly as Cecilia took charge of that situation . Katherini said accusingly to Strang , " Drakon lives here ? And you did n't tell me ! " " Let 's eat and drink first , " Cecilia coaxed her . " That 's best , " Strang said . " Eat first , and then we 'll talk . " He took a large gulp of Scotch . He needed it . He said to Tommy in a low voice , " Tell me  --  is n't the name Metsos an abbreviation for Demetrius ? " Tommy nodded . " Why do you ask ? " " I was just making quite sure . " He looked over at Katherini , who , at last , had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that encouragement . He looked at the telephone , decided to postpone his call to Pringle until he had broken the latest piece of news to Katherini , or otherwise there would be incoherentinterruptions to his talk with Pringle . And when he did make a call , interruptions were the last thing he would need . Hep210would have to be quick , calm , concise , and very sure of the facts . They were building up unpleasantly . " I 'm sorry , " he said to Tommy . " I thought that all I had to do was to put in a telephone call , prepare Pringle to receive boarders , and then leave you with many many thanks . But the fact is , we 're sort of beleaguered here . And I do n't know quite how to handle it . " He finished his drink , and frowned down at a large stain on the rug . Someone had spilled a bottle of ink there , one time . He pulled his thoughts back into disciplined ranks again . " I recognized the man in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say went to Metsos Drakon 's flat . " Then he stopped , looking sharply at Tommy . " The first floor ? " Lord , he thought , my brain is turning to cheese : you do n't need an elevator to reach the first floor . " The first floor , " ' Tommy insisted . " I think  --  " Cecilia called across the room , and then stopped apologetically . It was difficult to contradict such a patient host . " I 'd have called it the second floor , " she ended tactfully . " Oh , you Americans ! " Tommy said delightedly , as the truth dawned . " Why do n't you call things by their right names ? There 's the ground floor , then the first floor , then the second , then the third , where you now are . Naturally ! I suppose you 'd call this the fourth ? " Strang smiled politely . " That 's right . Now let 's straighten me out . No one has gone to Christophorou 's apartment , which is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Drakon 's , on the second . Right ? " " American style ? Right ! " Tommy said , still diverted . " And so we return Michalopoulos to his usual state of virtue . I must admit I was rather surprised . " Strang glanced at his watch . " Feeling better ? " he asked Katherini . " All right , here 's the latest news : I saw Nikos Kladas get out of the car  --  yes , the same green car that chased you and Petros all over Athens  --  and come into this house . He is in Drakon 's apartment , right now , along with your aunt . " Katherini surprised him . She said , with an interest that chased her fears away , " And the green car ? " " It left . Andreas was driving . I do n't think there was anyone else in the car , for Andreas got out to help Nikos Kladas into the hall . That leg must have been badly hurt . " Katherini laughed . " Then Petros escaped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it ! " She looked at Strang triumphantly.  | " You were right and I was wrong , " he said , thinking , as he watched her , that there was nothing like two thick slabs of buttercoatedbread to soothe raw nerves . But he wished he did n't always get a feeling of some underbattle of the sexes between that girl and him . All right , all right : so men were stupid oafs , bumbling braggarts . Who had taught her to dislike men so much ? Men ? Or her aunt ? " And now  --  if you 'll go on eating ? " He picked up the telephone . Cecilia had laughed , and perhaps that cheered him up . Or perhaps it was the knowledge that Petros had managed to evade the great Nikos . One thing was quite certain : Nikos would n't be here if Petros had been caught . Katherini was right about that . He waited impatiently for Pringle to answer at his end . " See  --  you are safe here , " Cecilia was reassuring Katherini . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll be scared  --  they 'll think you and Petros are both in some police station , talkinga hundred and twenty words to the minute . " I wish that were so , Strang thought ; that would have solved a lot of problems , but we had Miss Katherini 's tangled loyalties to treat lightly . Still , we 've managed one thing : somehow , in our stumbling , improvising way , we have sent Madame Duval into temporary hiding ; the house on Kriton Street is no longer so safe . That 's why she came here . And now Nikos , too . They are off balance . They 've got to decide what to do next , if Petros and Katherinica n't be found . They do n't know how catastrophic , or how negligible , Katherini 's escape may be for them . And in spite of the nagging anxiety of this long wait by the telephone , Strang 's spirits began to lift . Good for old Petros , he thought with sudden and intensegratitude . At last , Pringle 's receiver was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impatient . " Later  --  " Pringle cut him short . " I 'm busy right now . Got someone here . See you tomorrow . " " Is that Christophorou with you ? " " No . He left ten minutes ago . He 's probably  --  " " Good ! Now listen  --  " " I ca n't . Not right now . " Pringle dropped his voice . " The Colonelis here . " " The rows of medals I met last night ? Is he still dragging his feet ? " " Far from it . I underestimated that situation , I 'm glad to say . " " So did someone else , I think . " " What are you getting at ? "  | " I have urgent news for the Colonel . Better listen and pass it on . " " About what ? " " The conspiracy . " There was a silence more explicit than words . Then Pringle 's voice said sharply , " Shut up , you damn fool ! How do you know about that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; I trust him completely ; I hand over the documents . What 's more , how could this damn fool get you to listen , unless he mentioned the unmentionable ? We are at Tommy 's apartment , beleaguered . Yes , Tommy 's . Miss Hillard is with me . And a girl who can tell you a lot about the people involved in the unmentionable you-knowwhat . We 're trying to keep her hidden , and alive , until we can bring her around to your place . " " Not here ! " " But  --  " " Not here ! There 's trouble starting up  --  rumors that I 've been interfering in Greek affairs . " " That 's nonsense ! " " But dynamite . Christophorou was worried enough by it to come around this evening and tip me off . " " He would . " " What do you mean ? " Pringle 's voice was very quiet . " That 's the third crack you have made this  --  " " It 's a scare job . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it quite so calmly . There is a pretty unpleasant paragraph in a newspaper , tomorrow , that  --  " " Who planted it ? And why ? It 's a scare job , I tell you . You have every right to work on Steve 's case . He 's an American . " " You seem to forget he is dead . " " He is n't . At least , he was alive last night . Katherini Roilos can tell you all about him . Also about Madame Duval and Nikos KIadas , who are in an apartment , right this moment , second floor , this building . Tenant 's name is Demetrius Drakon . Also , there is a house on Kriton Street , newly renovated , cream color , brown shutters , white-walled garden . Rented by Evgenia Vasilika for Duval as her headquarters in Athens . Inside that house , you 'll find . . . " " Good God ! " Pringle said . " Stay there ! Do nothing ! I 'll call you right back . " The line went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver , and replaced it . He looked over at the others ruefully . The girls were talking , close-cosseted . Tommy had picked up a magazine and was concentrating on it with studied politeness . Strang thought , I 'll give Pringle exactly three minutes to tell the Colonel all that , and then I 'll call back . And , this time , I 'll finish what I have to say . What did people do in emergencies before the telephone was invented ? Bless Mr. AlexanderGraham Bell for solving people 's problems so quickly . And then he wondered what problems were being solved downstairs in the Drakon apartment , right now , by the speed of telephone ? Whatever we can do , they can do , he reminded himself . Then he resisted this gloomy idea and forced himself to remember that , whatever was happening in that apartment downstairs , they were still off balance . Katherini had interrupted a long flow of words to Cecilia . She rose , looked at Strang . " Did you tell them about Maria ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me back . " And then , as a look of distress passed over her pale face , he said , " Do n't worry , Katherini , I sha n't forget . And the other news is good . There is a colonel in Greek Intelligence right now with my friend Pringle . I think we 'll see some quick action . " He picked up the telephone again , but there was only that old depressing sound of a line alreadyengaged . He replaced the receiver and tried to look cheerful , for Katherini was still watching him . " The Colonel is working on that , right now , " he told her . " This waiting will soon be over . " She said slowly , " And after they listen to me ? What then ? " She did n't wait for his answer . She turned back to Cecilia , sat down beside her . Cecilia said gently , " Do n't worry , Katherini . We 'll see that . . . " " Do n't worry ? " It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps saying do n't worry , do n't worry ! " She bit her lip , regained control . " Let me talk some more . Then I forget to worry . " Cecilia said , " Are you sure you want to  --  " " Yes . " Katherini sat down , and began talking , almost in a whisper . Tommy came forward , the magazine open in his hands . " So we 're locked out , are we ? " he asked , with a humorous glint in his eyes as he glanced briefly at the two girls on the sofa . " All right , let 's adjourn to the smoking room . " He drew Strang over toward his armchair . " Pull in a chair and make yourself comfortable . If Pringlep214is ringing you here , it would be wiser simply to wait ; his telephone may be needed , at this moment . You 've probably stirred up quite a little hornet 's nest with that call of yours . Oh , yes , indeed , I was listening . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you said . How interesting  --  " Strang stopped looking at the telephone , and took a chair oppositeTommy . " Now this is very Greek , " Tommy said genially . " Men here ; women there . " He waited . The word " conspiracy " was still in his eyes . " I 'll have to disappoint you , at the moment , " Strang said . " But I 'll promise one thing : as soon as I can , and when I can  --  " he paused . " You 'll tell me the whole story ? " Tommy was not quite believing . " As much as I know of it . That 's possibly very little . " Tommy glanced at him in surprise , his disbelief now evident . " Look  --  " Strang said , " I 'm only an architect who is interested inGreek temples . " Tommy looked . His sharp eyes studied the American . Then he smiled . " I 've seen stranger incidents than this . During the German occupation , and in the Communist troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , most of us have strange stories to tell , many of them incomplete , fantastic , with at least five explanations . I sometimes think that normal , everyday life is only a delusion . We walk on a thin crust of earth which we call peace ; and every now and again we can hear a rumble below our feet ; and sometimes the crust splits and we see that , underneath , there is a glowing inferno ready to erupt . Sometimes it does , sometimes it does n't , but it is always there . " He glanced over at Katherini , who was still talking intentlyto Cecilia . His tone changed . " At least she is calmer now . It 's a very difficult thing , you know , to be a refugee . At first , all you want to do is to escape . Once you have escaped , you start to think about the friends who did n't escape . And you 're torn between stay ing and returning , and you do n't know what to do . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question she asked tonight . You noticed it ? " Strang nodded . What then ? " And I could n't answer it . " " Just as well . No one can answer it for any refugee . It is a cruel question . You ask it when you realize that escape is not enough . You have exchanged one set of problems for another , that is all . Are you brave enough to start all over again ? That 's the real cluesp215tion . And a refugee has to answer that for himself . " He shook his head , sadly . " I think , " Strang said , groping tactfully for the right words , " that it would be best for everyone if you did n't mention the fact that we brought Katherini here tonight . Not even to a very close friend , like Aleco Christophorou . " " I should n't dream of discussing this with anyone , " Tommy said stiltedly . He was hurt at the unnecessary suggestion . " I did n't mean a discussion , " Strang said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a  --  well , a neighborly little chat in the front hall , one morning . " " I hardly ever see Aleco . " " I thought he was a friend . " A shadow drifted over Tommy 's brow . " He was one of the brightestpupils I ever had . " " How long did he hold his professorship ? " " Professorship ? " " Professor of Law at Athens University , was n't he ? " " Where on earth did you pick up that idea ? " Tommy had recovered his equanimity as Strang looked completely dumfounded . " No , he never was given any appointment at the University , although I think he would have liked one . It was a bit of a disappointment , I gather . But he would spread his talents around as if they were butter . I warned him repeatedly when he was a boy . He never would listen to anyone , though . " Tommy sighed . " First , he was going to be an archaeologist . Then he went to Oxford and read history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political science . Then back to Athens  --  for law . We all thought he was settled in a career , at last . But he had that disappointment , and then he went off to fight in the war . He did very well in it , I hear . He 's extraordinarily brave , you know . " " And after that ? " " Politics . He made some excellent speeches , stood for election to parliament , and lost . I rather think the voters could n't take an existentialist quite seriously . Oh , yes , that had become his postwar enthusiasm . " Tommy shook his head . " Life to most Greeks may be either tragic or comic or a mixture of both ; but one thing it never is  --  and that is , meaningless . They would never have survived if they had believed that . " " And since then ? " " I 've rather lost track of him . Traveled a good deal , I heard.  |p216Now  , he is a free-lance journalist , writes very superior articles on international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will end as a pundit . " Tommy laughed . " Careers are extraordinary things . So much wasted  --  then so much retrieved , unexpectedly . " So much wasted ? Strang wondered about that . Or had everything contributed its share to the complete education of Aleco Christophorou ? " What about his family ? " Strang asked . " How do they feel about all this ? " Tommy said , " Now there 's one situation that is completely meaningless . " He pushed himself out of his comfortable chair . " Let me give you another drink , Strang . " Then he looked at the magazine still lying open on his table . " Dear me ! I meant to show you where I first heard about you . " He pointed to a column of print , took Strang 's glass , and walked across to his cupboard . The opened page seemed to deal with notes on art and music , each given a separate paragraph under its own headline . But at this hour of the morning , it was indeed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shall I translate ? " Tommy called over his shoulder . " Which paragraph is it ? " " The one beginning ' Famous Greek photographer commissioned by Perspective , renowned American magazine . ' Clumsy , but appropriatelyexuberant . You are mentioned , too , in the last line . But you are n't a Greek . " " Neither is Steve Kladas , technically , " Strang said , trying to cover his sudden alarm . " Perspective 's publicity department seems to have been supplying us with a lot of advance billing . When was this published ? " " January , I think . " January it was . " You look thoughtful , " Tommy said , handing him his drink . " I am , " Strang said grimly . So Steve 's arrival in Greece had been announced before he left New York . Christophorou could have heard about it even before he went visiting Steve 's sister in Sparta . Even before Christophorou got my letter , Strang thought , he probably knew all about the Perspective job . " Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And talked about ? " " That 's why it is read ! What would one do for conversation if one could n't repeat what one reads ? I borrow it steadily fromp217Christophorou  --  Aleco 's father , that is . I visit the family every week , you know . The father has n't been at all well for some years now ; confined to his room , most depressing . " Strang put down the magazine . " Do n't you ever meet Aleco there ? " Tommy 's face changed . A blank mask stared back at Strang . " Not since the war . " He sat down in his chair again . " He never visits his family . They never talk of him . " " They forward letters to him . " " You would scarcely expect them to burn them . " Strang looked startled . " I told you it was a strange situation . I never can discuss Aleco with his father , of course . But one of his sisters did try to explain things to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens , Alecowarned his father that hostages would be taken into the mountainsif the Communists had to retreat . His father would n't believe him . The family stayed in Athens . Then , at the end , they were seized as hostages and marched toward the mountains . But I told you about that , did n't I ? " How , wondered Strang , could such a warning be given ? " Surely , he ca n't blame his father for staying in Athens . After all , that forced march was a surprise move . " " It was also an idiotic , cruel , and completely bankrupt piece of blackmail , " Tommy said angrily , too absorbed in his own thoughts to catch Strang 's reasoning . " Anyhow , there 's the situation in the Christophorou family . Aleco does blame his father , for he has never seen his father since . " " And his father ? " " Quite silent . " Because he never could solve the problem of how his son had been able to give such a warning ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride , kept silent ? No , no , Strang told himself quickly , you are reading too much into that incident . All it proves is that Christophorou always did keep a close ear to the ground , a very close ear . " I seem to have depressed you , " Tommy said , wondering . Strang stared at the drink in his hand and finished it quickly . " What the hell is keeping Pringle ? " he asked angrily , and went over to the telephone again . This time , the line was not engaged . There was a short wait ,  |p218though  . Then a woman 's voice answered . It was American , polite but impersonal , and smothered with sleep . " Mrs. Pringle ? Is your husband there ? This is Kenneth Strang . " But he could sense the answer before he heard it . " I 'm sorry . He left . With Colonel Zafiris . " " Where can they be reached , do you know ? " " Have n't the faintest . Sorry . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " He put down the receiver quickly . " No luck , " he said to Tommy . " You are still stuck with us , I 'm afraid . All we can do is wait . " He glanced over at the sofa . Katherini had finished her slow , quiet monologue . She looked at him . " It wo n't take long now , " he reassured her , and felt relieved when she nodded calmly . He noticed Cecilia had been writing something down in that notebook she carried in her bag . What 's going on ? he wondered , took a step toward her , and then was halted by Tommy 's voice . " Pringle has left his apartment ? " " Yes . " " Well , he will telephone you whenever he reaches wherever he is going . It must have been urgent . " " Yes . " Urgent enough to push Pringle farther into the Greek political maze . Poor old Pringle , trying to keep a balance between helping and interfering . It was a slender line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tommy tried tactfully . " Let us comfort ourselves that we also serve . Please do n't be alarmed if I fall asleep around three o'clock . I always do . " " We 'll be out of here long before then , " Strang said determinedly . Still thinking of Pringle and his problems , he asked , " You know George Ottway , do n't you ? Would you pass on a warning to him ? " He looked around sharply , as Katherini rose and walked into the little hall . The bathroom door opened and closed . Ceciliawas studying the book on her lap . " Anything wrong ? " he asked . She looked up and shook her head reassuringly . " A warning for Ottway ? " Tommy was startled enough to drop all comfortable drowsiness . He sat bolt upright , his amiable face contorted between a banished yawn and growing surprise . " He could be facing some very nasty trouble . I 've got a feeling that anyone who seems dangerous to this conspiracy is being eliminated . Neutralized , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved out of Greece , for instance . The same thing could happen to Ottway. "  | " Why ? " " Because he could identify a man called Nikos Kladas , whom he knew as Sideros during the war . " " Ottway 's a fairly hard-bitten type , quite capable of taking care of himself . " " But he 's vulnerable . " Strang thought of Caroline Ottway . " How ? " " He had a fairly close friendship with Nikos , back in the moun-tains . " " Back in the mountains , " Tommy said a little stiffly , " close friendships were common . There is such a thing as comrade-ship  --  " " I know , I know . Nikos was nineteen , perhaps less . A hero-worshiper , probably . The closer-than-glue type . Difficult to shake off . Until he transferred his admiration to Ares , and became one of his select little group . You have heard of Ares ? " Tommy had . He recovered himself . " But Ottway avoided Ares and his group of sadists like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but contempt for killers . I have heard him on the subject of Ares . He certainly would n't even exchange two sentences with this Nikos , once he became attached to Ares . " " I 'm sure that 's all true , too . But his past friendship could be twisted . " " How ? " Tommy was short , both in manner and voice . But his eyes showed he clearly understood . " I heard the first innuendoes , yesterday . " " Preposterous ! " " Will you warn Ottway ? " " You 've been talking to the wrong kind of people , Strang . " " That 's very possible , " Strang agreed wryly . " Who invented such a piece of nonsense ? " Tommy demanded indignantly . It took something of an effort to refrain from saying that Christophorouhad at least passed on that particular piece of nonsense , even if he had n't invented it . " The rumor may be spread , that 's our worry , " Strang said patiently . " If Ottway has to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Sh ! " said Tommy , glancing nervously at Cecilia , who had risen and was coming over toward them . " Will you warn Ottway ? " Strang insisted . " Put him on his guard , at least ? For instance , his wife seems to trust a man called Yorghis ,  |p220who  has been giving her Greek lessons pretty openly . Yorghis will soon he visiting the Ottways ' new apartment . " ' ' Really  --  what have you against Yorghis ? " " I do n't trust him . " " That is hardly sufficient reason  --  " Tommy began , but this time Cecilia did contradict him . " Ken is right , you know , " she said gently . " I 've just been hearing all about Yorghis . Evgenia Vasilika hired him to drive to Nauplion yesterday morning . Somewhere near there , he picked up Madame Duval and drove her back to Athens . How did she get off her yacht without being noticed ? Quite simple . The yacht arrived before dawn ; Madame Duval was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good heavens ! " Tommy said . Cecilia 's quiet voice changed . " How can people live like that ? " she asked angrily . " Lies , deceit , treason , treachery -- how can they bear it ? " Strang said , " Katherini told you everything ? " " Just about . " " She 's crazy ! " But why , he wondered worriedly , why did she talk ? " No , she is n't . She 's incredibly realistic . Even spelled out the names for me . " Cecilia handed over her notebook to Strang . " And it is safer to share such information . " " Safer for whom ? " Strang asked angrily . " Five hours ago you knew nothing at all , and now  --  " " It 's incredible , the ignorance we can live in , " Cecilia admitted . " You 're crazier than she is , " he told her . He examined the list of names and places and dates . The style was cryptic , but decipherable . The information , in six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? he wondered again . " See if she is all right , " he told Cecilia , quickly . And quickly , too , he ripped out the six pages . " Do n't destroy  --  " " No . I 'm keeping them . " Not you , my sweet , crazy darling . " Do I go into that bathroom , or do you ? " he threw the notebook down on Tommy 's table , and jammed the dangerous papers into his pocket . Cecilia was already in the hall . " Do you think the girl  --  ? " Tommy was too alarmed to finish his sudden thought . He was on his feet , following Strang into the hall , his face white at the notion of suicide.  |p221But  there was no one in the bathroom . In the kitchen , they found the back door unbolted and unchained . " Kriton Street ! " Cecilia said . " Can she have gone to help Maria ? " " That 's just the kind of wild idea she 'd have , " Strang said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of footsteps , of movement . He closed the door so that he could talk . " I 'm going down to have a look . What 's the geography , Tommy ? " " There 's a short corridor in the basement . At one end , there 's a flight up to the front hall . At the other , a door to a small back patch of ground , surrounded by walls . " " Any door or gate there ? " " An old iron gate , high . Never used . Padlocked and chained . I remember it well : I had to climb over it when the Germans were coming in by the front entrance . " " What 's outside the gate ? " " A rabbit warren of concrete and wood . But she 'll never climb over that gate . It 's ten feet high or more . I had a rope , hidden for such an emergency . Otherwise , I could never have managed it . As it was , I nearly broke my leg on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the rabbit warren ? " " By guess and by God , " Tommy said . " There were several exits then . But that was seventeen years ago . They may be closed now  --  all this rebuilding , since the war , you know . " " Chain this door , " Strang told him . " I 'll knock three times when 1 get back . " He nodded reassuringly to Cecilia and stepped outside , pulling the door closed behind him to end any argument . Quietly , he ran down the staircase , a monotonous repetition , betweenbare yellow walls , of flight and landing , flight and landing ; a thing of little beauty but a temporary joy , for the solid stone stairs had no creak to them . The third floor , he noted , had a high ventilation window in its kitchen , just like Tommy 's , except that Mr. Louizis Michalopoulos , dreaming of past triumphs in the wool market , had left his window open on its hinge . It would be too much to expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . When Strang reached the second floor , he found the same type of window , but this one was covered by iron bars . The light in Drakon 's kitchen was on . But there was no sound from the apartment . The door , he noticed as he passed quickly , was the samep222as Tommy 's : no outside keyhole to be picklocked , everything held fast by interior bolts and chains . Quickly , too , he passed the back of Christophorou 's apartment on the first floor . It was blacked out , blankly silent . And then there was only a short flight of steps to the basement corridor and the door leading out into the yard . At the other end of the corridor was another flight of stairs , leading up into the main hall . From the caretaker 's door , a zone of sleeping respectability , came a softly muted mezzosoprano snore , steadily rhythmical . The door into the yard was unlocked . He opened it carefully , but there was no creak in its hinges . A well-oiled door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold darkness , broken by clouded moonlight , he saw a little stretch of bare earth , bounded by a high wall and a forest of buildings . The gate stood opposite him . He picked his way past a coil of rusted chicken wire , battered crates , a small hen coop . The iron gate 's padlock was open , its rusty chain hung loose . He pushed the gate ; it swung open a couple of inches , quite soundlessly . Someone had been busy with his little oilcan around here . He pulled the gate back into position , retreated back inside the house . Katherini had had the most fantastic luck , he thought , as he closed the door carefully behind him . That was , he added , if she had used the back exit . But she might have been in too much of a hurry to waste time in exploring an unknown yard ; she might have come running down the service staircase and headed straight for the front hall , a territory she at least knew . In which case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to catch up . Or , perhaps , he would n't ; perhaps he would be too thankful to see that she had managed to escape out of this house alive . For that , he admitted as he walked quietly past the caretaker 's door and then started up the short flight of stairs that led to the front hall , had been the fear that had sent him rushing down from Tommy 's apartment , the fear that one of Madame Duval 's thugs had been guarding the service stairs and that Katherini had been caught . But Drakon 's apartment had been peaceful : no sound of questioning , of forced answers , of violence . Peace and unsuspicion everywhere , thank God . And then , just as he reached the main hall , two men stepped out from the wall on either side of him and seized his wrists in an iron grip.  |p223Strang  's first instinct was to struggle , free himself , hit out , run . But as he looked at the grave faces of the two compact men and saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . They were neither Boris nor Andreas . And if they had been guardingMadame Duval , they would n't be holding him by the wrists . By this time , he ought to have been cracked over his skull with that handy-looking revolver which the smaller of the men had produced in a businesslike way . " And who are you ? " the small man asked now . The tone was inimical , but the man was curious , at least . That decided Strang . Thugs did not ask questions . These men might not be dressed in police uniform , but they had the confidence of those who acted on the side of the law . He identified himself quickly . " Do you speak English ? " he added urgently . He had a feeling that his Greek might not be adequate enough for this kind of situation . The small man nodded . He glanced at the front door , where two other men were entering , and nodded again , this time approvingly . " Search him , " he said to his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ten or fifteen minutes ? " Strang asked , ignoring the adept hands that slapped his pockets and found them flat enough . " A girl ? " The man 's sharp eyes were wary but not astonished . 1 fe was a neat little man with neat expressions ; dark of hair , eyes , mustache , and suit ; as sparing of movement as he was with words . " I sent a message  --  " Strang paused . He glanced across the hall at Christophorou 's door , and wondered for a split second if ChristOphorouhad returned home and could hear them . He dropped hisp224voice almost to a whisper . " Then she must have gone out through the back gate . " The searching hands were at his waist , at his ribs . He resisted the impulse to tell their owner that he never did believe in shoulder holsters . The searcher found his wallet and was studyinghis driver 's license . He seemed satisfied , for he slipped the walletback in place . " The gate ? " the small man asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard at the back of the house . " And I do n't carry a knife strapped to my leg , either , he refrained from telling the man with the practiced hand , who was insisting on completinghis search . The man  --  even if he did n't speak English could certainly understand it , for his hand froze on Strang 's ankle  --  looked up quickly . The other man let go of Strang 's wrist . He gestured down the staircase to the corridor . " Show me this gate , " he said . " You first ! " Strang started down the stairs , trying to rub some of the paralysis out of his wrist . There was no use losing his temper ; he was at this moment , quite frankly , a nuisance of an amateur who was complicatinga professional man 's difficult job . He said , " The girl ran away . I came down from the top floor to see if I could find any  --  " " Sh ! " the man silenced him abruptly . They both halted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door at the end of the corridor , there came a decided click , as if a heavy key had been turned too quickly in its lock . The Greek shoved Strang aside and leaped down into the corridor and raced toward the back door . It was locked . Strang tried the handle for himself . He looked at the Greek , and the Greek looked at him . Outside , in the small courtyard , there was only the silence of stealth . They heard the brief rattle of an iron chain , abruptly stilled . " That , " said Strang , " was someone locking the gate . " Now , there was no sound at all except the sudden crackle of a child 's night cough . The Greek moved quickly to the caretaker 's door and thumped hard on it . Then he raced back along the corridor , called sharply up to the hall , set a flurry of footsteps in motion and a quick fluster of low voices in canon-like echo . He came running back to the care taker 's door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Open , open ! " he kept repeating . Over his shoulder , he asked , " That gate outside  --  where does it lead ? " " I do n't know . Perhaps to the next street . " " I have sent two men to look there . " He was still worried , andp225angry . " All that time wasted  --  with you ! " he said bitterly , as the caretaker 's door opened , and a woman stood , frightened , wary , uncertain , her eyes still puffed with sleep . She screamed . The whimperingchild in the room behind her burst into a terrified yell . The woman screamed again . That 's all we needed , thought Strang . He looked up the service staircase , listening for any sound of a door being opened . But he could hear nothing . The little man had quieted the woman and got the back-door key . Strang said , " There was only one pair of footsteps , was n't there ? " But the Greek was already in the yard , examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering who would come down first  --  Duval or Nikos Kladas , feeling naked with only his two bare hands to cope with that problem , wishing that he had borrowed Tommy 's stick at least , willing the Greek to come back from the gate with that revolver , which had become a most comforting object . But when the man did return , the look of deepened suspicion on his hard-set face was far from comforting . " Look  --  " began Strang , and stopped . Explanations might only confuse everything still more . He asked , " Why have n't they come down ? They must have heard the woman 's scream . " " We shall wait here , " the man told him . He looked at his revolver , then at the staircase . I suppose that makes sense , Strang thought . Two men had been sent to the other street ; one man left to guard the front hall , one man here alone with an unarmed nuisance of a foreigner : that was n't much of a boarding party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for how long , wait for what ? Behind him , he heard the Greek question the woman . And her answers were exactly as one might expect : she had the only key for the door to the yard , she kept it in her kitchen , it was always there unless she was using the yard ; the gate was always locked ; she had a key for that , too , but no one else had these keys ; why should they ? Why should they , indeed ? Strang thought wryly . This whole setup was perfect for anyone leading a double life , for a conspiratorwho needed an unobtrusive exit in that emergency for which all conspirators must plan . " Your child is crying , " the Greek told the woman severely . " Why do you stay here ? Go inside . Lock the door . Let no one enter . Keep out of the way ! "  |p226Strang  said , " I 'm going upstairs . You 'll find me in the Englishman'sapartment on the top  --  " " You will wait here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And then , as he heard the sound of cars from the front of the house and quick footsteps entering the hall above him , he relaxed a little . " Now , " he said , " you can lead the way . I shall follow . " Strang heard him stop at Christophorou 's door . He was studying it curiously . " No lock ? " he said softly , almost to himself . He reached out and turned the handle gently . But the door was bolted from within . He seemed puzzled . This man is no fool , Strang thought ; whoever came down the staircase and slipped into the yard must have left an open door behind him . It was so obvious the minute the Greek made his quiet check , but it was the kind of thing I 'd have remembered to do by the time I reached Tommy 's doorway . And then he thought , Was that a routine check or was there any particular interest in Christophorou ? The Greek signaled to him to wait . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment , Strang stared in amazement at Colonel Zafiris , no less , who was leading the way , Is this usual ? he wondered in surprise , and then found his answer in the look of stupefaction that showed on his companion 's face for a moment , to be quickly covered by a slightly nervous smile . He began explaining the series of small disasters in a quick , low voice . ( He did n't blame himself . But he did n't blame Strang , either . Strang was impressed . ) " Enough , Elias , enough ! " The Colonel waved him into silence , and pointed up the stairs toward the next floor . He wasted no time , either , on greeting Strang . A brief nod , a quick sharp look , and his eyes were turned to Christophorou 's door as he passed it . He took a decided grip on its handle and tested it for himself . And that , Strang decided as he noted the Colonel 's pursed lips and drawn brow , had not been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staircase . Strang had to stretch his legs to keep up with him . It was surprising that a man so solidly built and compact in shape could move so quickly , so lightly . Nothing seemed to have changed at Drakon 's apartment . The light still shone through the barred kitchen window . The silence was complete . The Colonel gestured to the window , and one of his men was given a hoist up to its level . But he must have seen and heard nothing , for the expression on his face as he looked around at thep227Colonel was blank . They have gone , the woman Duval and Nikos have gone , Strang thought worriedly ; they slipped through that confounded gate while I sat upstairs and waited for a telephone call . And then Drakon went out , after them , carefully locking door and gate behind him . They 've gone , that 's certain ; there is no one in there . Strang looked at the Colonel and wondered how this volcanowould erupt when he heard the witness had vanished as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , while one of them tried its handle gently . The door was not bolted . It moved a cautious inch . The gap widened to six inches . The door was n't chained , either . The men looked at the Colonel . And at that moment the silence was cracked by the sharp clack of loose slippers overhead . Strang looked upward . An elderly man , sparse hair fuzzed into a gray mat above a long and doleful yellowed face , his hands clutchinghis dressing gown around him , peered down . " Did a woman scream ? " he asked Strang . His eyes traveled to the group of men around the door . His toothless gums gaped . He turned and scutteredback to his own apartment . " Police ! " he was screaming in a piercing falsetto . " Police ! Get the police ! " His door rattled shut . Silence returned . Well , thought Strang , we can now all break into a song and dance . Anyone inside , if there is anyone there , has certainly been fully briefed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so helpful , " he said very quietly . The Colonel heaved a deep sigh , walked briskly over to the door as he unbuttoned the flap of his gun holster , kicked the six-inch gap into a wide open sweep and drew sharply aside for a few moments . Strang counted silently , in the photographer 's formula : one bloody second , two bloody seconds , three bloody seconds , four  --  and the Colonel was in the kitchen . Impatient fellow , Strang thought , or very brave . Or a man with all his hunches in good working order . For the Colonel had been right : there was no resistance . And Strang had been wrong : the apartment was not empty . Nikos Kladas was lying in the hall , spread-eagled and stiff , face twisted sideways , mouth open in a last protest , a neat hole between his eyes . Madame Duval , in the sitting room , was resting permanentlyin a high-backed chair . One side of her face was unrecognizable . There was a small revolver at her feet , dropped  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limply by her side . Strang turned away.  | " Can you name them ? " the Colonel asked . " Madame Etienne Duval . Nikos Kladas . So Duval 's niece said , at least . " " And what is her name ? " " Katherini Roilos . " The Colonel was surprised enough to say " Ah ! " Then his eyes became expressionless again . " Is she the witness you have up-stairs ? " " She was . She left . " " You let her go ? " There was the hint of real anger in the careful voice . " She slipped out by the back door . That is why your men found me downstairs . I thought she might still be in the building , or in the street outside . " The Colonel took a deep breath . " So you let her escape , " he said . He sounded sad now , and fatalistic , as if so many disappointmentshad come his way that one more was not too hard to bear . " She was n't a prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to leave like that . " Strang 's own anger was showing . He muzzled it . " At least , they did n't get her . " He looked at Nikos Kladas . " Katherini said he was also known as Sideros . And Duval used the name of Elektra . The man Drakon was known as Odysseus . They all worked with Ares , during the war . " The Colonel was quite impassive . It would be impossible for him not to recognize the name of Ares , Strang thought ; everyone , even people like Tommy , knew that name . So it was also possible that he recognized the other aliases , too . Strang searched in his pocket and drew out the sheets of paper from Cecilia 's notebook . " You 'll find all that , and more , written down here . " The Colonel took the sheets of paper . " Your handwriting ? " And Strang , who hoped he had managed very neatly to keepCecilia 's name out of all this , looked at him and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Hillard 's . " " Ah ! " The Colonel seemed to know about Cecilia . He frowned at her notes . " Do n't worry , " he said , " we shall arrange for someone to guard her , of course . " Strang looked at him . " Thank you , " he said very quietly . " Is it necessary to ask her any questions ? " He glanced at his watch . " I 'd like to get Miss Hillard back to the Grande Bretagne . She is droppingwith exhaustion . If you need me , I 'll come back and fill youp229in on any of these details . " He pointed to the notes in the Colonel 's hand , tried to conceal his own fatigue . The Colonel studied the American 's face . " I have enough to work on , tonight , both here and at my office . " He gave his first smile . " Do not be so depressed , Mr. Strang . We may know more than you think we do . " His brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about the conspiracy ? " he asked . " Christoph  --  " Strang began . He took a deep breath . " He was explaining the urgency of the situation to me . That 's how I heard . No details . Or very few . Just enough to let me know that  --  " he paused again  --  " everything was very urgent , " he ended lamely . The Colonel 's eyes showed a brief gleam of sardonic humor . " Indeed it is , " he murmured . Strang glanced at the men , hands carefully gloved , who were quickly searching the room with complete absorption . They had opened every drawer and closet , examined every book shelf , picture frame , chair . Not that there was so much to search ; the apartment was a stilted place , barely furnished , characterless . The only thing that did n't attract any attention , now that pockets had been examined , was the two bodies . The Colonel said , as if he had been following Strang 's thoughts , " They are police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strang risked guessing . A heavy dark eyebrow was raised . " Execution , " the grave voice corrected him . Strang hid his surprise . " Drakon must be pretty desperate if he 'd kill them right here , in his own special hideaway . " " It might be the only place where he could get them together without any suspicion of danger . They obviously expected nothing . " He glanced down at the wrist of Nikos Kladas 's outstretched ann . " He did n't even have time to throw that knife . " It was true ; the hilt of a knife had been slipped out of Nikos 's cuff , but not quickly enough . " This is all very far removed from your world , is it not , Mr. Strang ? " the Colonel asked , watching the American 's amazement . " I think you should return to it . Your friends will be anxious . By this time , Mr. Pringle will have joined them . " He paused , and then said , " Do not worry so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have been spared much trouble . If they had come to trial , there would have been organizedprotests ; and they would have been described as great patriotsduring the Nazi war . Their guilt would have been coveredp230in a cloud of doubt , so that those who had proof of their treason would have been made to look tyrants . It is strange , is it not , that the real patriots of the war , who were killed by these two and their friends , should so seldom be remembered ? I had a friend . Colonel Psarros . He was murdered by them . On Mount Parnassos . " The Colonel looked down at Nikos Kladas . " There we have complete justice : the traitor betrayed , the murderer murdered . " He seemed to have forgotten Strang . A car drew up outside the house . " That is the police coming to take charge , " the Colonel said , steering Strang decisively toward the kitchen door . " Come and see me tomorrow at ten o'clock . Elias will bring you . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " The neat little man who was superintending the search of the apartment , with as much grave concern as he had watched Strang in the basement corridor , looked up briefly , nodded , and concentrated on his job again . " Ten o'clock , " Strang said , and made some quick calculations ; with luck , he might get five hours of sleep . Then he remembered the Colonel 's work " here and at my office . " He halted at the door . " Tell me one thing , Colonel . When do you sleep ? " He left a startled look behind him , and an unexpected smile . Even colonels liked sympathy . Strang found Tommy 's kitchen door wide open , with Cecilia and Tommy at its threshold and Bob Pringle , determinedly nonchalantby contrast , sitting on a corner of the small table . Strang closed the door and bolted it . " Thank heavens ! " Tommy said . " And about time , too ! " said Pringle . " Do n't you ever look at your watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face was pale , tense . He took her hand and held it . He asked Tommy , " How long have you had that door open ? " " We thought we heard a woman scream . It was n't the girl ? " " No . " " Then I arrived , " Pringle said , " or they would both have been down there , complicating the Colonel 's life still further . What happened ? " " We found the Duval woman and Nikos Kladas in Drakon 's place . Both dead . " Pringle 's nonchalance vanished . " Murdered ? "  | " Here  --  in this house ? " Tommy asked , equally aghast . Neither of them could quite believe it . " And the murderer ? " " Slipped out by your back gate . " " This is appalling , " Tommy said , " appalling . " " I told you these boys play rough , " Strang reminded him gently . " But who could have done this ? Drakon ? But the man is never here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep that apartment simply to put up friends when they visit Ath-ens . " " Let 's move toward a chair , " Pringle said , leading the way to the room . " Now , what happened ? " Strang said , " I 'll tell you later . I must get Cecilia back to the hotel . Colonel 's orders . " " But , " Tommy protested , " am I only to hear a little bit of the middle of a story ; no beginning and now no end ? " " We 'll come back some afternoon and have that cup of tea you promised us . " " How 's the Colonel taking all this ? " Pringle wanted to know . " I guess he has been defeated before and come up winning . " Pringle nodded . " And just when everything was going so well , " he said thoughtfully . " He had one terrific success tonight . Well , youca n't win all the time , I suppose . " " What success ? " Strang had found Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa . He began finding the right armholes for her . " Oh , that 's what kept me from calling you back at once . The Colonel got a telephone message just after you spoke to me . It seems there was a burglary over in his office while he was visiting me , a very neat little job . Those photographs were lifted  --  " " Steve 's ? " Strang asked , unbelieving , horrified . " Steve 's ? " " Now , now  --  " Pringle said soothingly , " no need for tremors . " He looked so unperturbed that Strang 's horror changed to amazement . Pringle did n't give him any chance for questions , though . " Good night , Tommy , " he said . " I 'd better see these two safely back to the Grande Bretagne and justify my existence . Thanks for taking care of them . " It was such a well-mannered good-by under decided control that Tommy could only say , " There 's no rush , really . I do n't usually go to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Pringle said , took Cecilia 's arm , and led her toward the front door.  | " Good-by , " she called back to Tommy . " We 'll come and see you  --  " She gave him , tired as she was , one of her warmest smiles . " Do n't forget , " Tommy said . He seemed a little crestfallen , after all , at the sudden end of this extraordinary visit . " Well  --  " he said to Strang . " We sha n't forget , " Strang promised . " And "  --  Tommy 's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper  --  " I 'll get in touch with Ottway . First thing tomorrow morning . Indeed , yes . " Strang paused at the front door . " You know , if Ottway liked to get in touch with Colonel Zafiris , he could do a lot of good . " " How ? " " He could identify these two bodies , for one thing . Clear up all doubts about them . He knew them , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem too much to ask him . " " It might be asking him to lay his head on the block . " Tommy pursed his lips . " Did you tell Colonel Zafiris to expect him ? " " No . Did n't mention his name . " Tommy nodded approvingly . " No good putting people into difficultsituations . Much better to let them decide for themselves . " Pringle was standing by the elevator door , listening to its approachingdrone . " Nearly here , " he warned Strang . " What are you two whispering about ? " " We 're starting a conspiracy of our own , " Strang told him . Pringlelooked shocked . Tommy laughed delightedly . A good host , thought Strang , should always be presented with something to cheer up his suddenly empty living room . He stepped into the elevatorquickly , took Cecilia 's arm away from Pringle 's charge , and said as they started down , " We 'll find police in the hall , no doubt . I 'll leave it all to you , Talleyrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Pringle drove his ancient Buick around several streets . His mood , away from Tommy , had changed . He was serious , worried . " And so the girl disappeared  --  " he began , frowning at the sleeping city . " Now , now  --  " Strang reminded him , " no need for tremors . " " How ? " " She left a sort of testament behind her . " " You gave it to the Colonel ? " " I have a few brains , if scattered . "  | " But why did she leave ? My God , she may get herself killed . " " Several reasons , probably . There usually are . " Cecilia said softly , " They mount up . They usually do . If only I had had the sense to stop her ! " " How ? " asked Strang . " By force ? I do n't see any of us holding a struggling girl . When a woman makes up her mind , boy  --  it 's made up . But "  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , but still a little  --  " she did n't have to sneak out like that . She could have walked out , any time . " " Except her world did n't let people walk out when they felt like it . That was why her brother , and father , too , died on the Megara road . " Pringle looked at Cecilia quickly . " Keep your eyes straight ahead , " Strang advised him . " And her name is Roilos , if that means anything to you , too . " It did . Pringle recovered his poise . " How things come out , and start fitting together ! And Steve Kladas  --  where is he ? " " He 's either still a prisoner , in which case he 's a dead man ; or he 's free , and in hiding . " " They 'd kill him , now ? " " Because of the fact that I handed over an envelope , last night . Until then , they needed Steve alive to find out from him where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the envelope , too . " Strang 's voice was bitter . " Hold it , hold it  --  " Pringle said . " The theft went according to plan . " " It was a trap ? They caught the thief ? " Pringle glanced at Cecilia . " I 'm asleep , " she told them , her eyes closed . Pringle said , " It was a trap . The thief is being followed . Also , there was a concealed camera registering every step of his little operation in the Colonel 's room . " " But the envelope ? " " Listen , will you ? The Colonel had been expecting some general skulduggery . I told you we underestimated him . He had copies made of everything in that envelope  --  the old negatives carefully printed , blown up . The technicians have been working on that steadily since this morning . " " But why since this morning ' ? " " That was when his colleagues decided that a lot of 1943 photographstaken of life in a guerrilla camp were of little use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people were and why he had taken their photographs . So , this morning , the Colonel took charge of Steve 's envelope . His way of looking at these old photographswas this : they had to be important , simply because at least one man had been murdered because of them . The Colonel takes murder as a more serious omen than most civilians , it appears . Then he got some of the best men from Military Intelligence to start working on the photographs . They 've got something , I hear . And the thieves have got a false sense of success . Neat tactics . " " Just a minute , " Strang said . " Is the Colonel in Military Intelli-gence ? " " He was at one time . Some months ago , he was lent to a civilian counterintelligence unit to work with them on illegal border crossings . There 's been a good deal of that recently , you know . Communistsreturning secretly after spending the last ten years or so in special training schools and camps in Bulgaria and Albania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pringle would give neither a yes nor a no to that question . " All the Greeks can do is to make sure that does n't happen . If they can eliminate the conspiracy , it obviously wo n't happen . That 's the dangerous thing about those extremist groups : they join forces , not because they love each other , but simply because they are willing to use any help to get power . And they always think that their group can control the others , and come out on top . They gamble on that , the criminal fools . All they do is create so much violence and bloodshed that the extreme right can step in to seize control . Then bang goes an elected government , predominantly left of centerbut moderate , at least , and what happens ? Dictatorship . " " What are the Colonel 's politics ? " " He was one of the old Venizelist army group : liberals , strongly republican , antiroyalist , but what the English call ' loyal opposition . ' That 's the reason Zafiris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the war , when the old rightist Metaxas dictatorshipwas in power . No opposition , loyal or otherwise , was allowedthen . " " That 's a strange inversion : army officers who were republi. cans . " " This is Greece , and politics are strange . For instance , who were indirectly responsible for putting a king back on the throne after the war ? The Communists . They shocked people into being royap235ist . And if they are planning any more terrorist trouble , this time they may well put back a rightist dictatorship in power . " " I can see how the Colonel and his republican friends are very loyal opposition . If that trouble started , they might have to go into exile again . " " If he were lucky . There 's no love lost between the liberals and the extreme right or the extreme left . " Pringle took a deep breath and shook his head slowly . " Do n't get me wrong . I love the Greeks . But , sometimes , they can break your heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops . " Your hotel is just around the corner to your right . It would look better if you arrived on your own two feet . What are your plans for tomorrow ? " " I 'm being taken to see the Colonel at ten o'clock . " " And after that ? " " I 'm waiting to hear news of Steve . " " Let me know when you do hear . " " Sure . " Strang glanced quickly at Pringle 's set face . " But do n't cut me out then . I 'm still in the game , Bob . " Pringle said , " You 've done your stint . Retire gracefully . It 's my job to make sure Stefanos Kladas is all right . See ? " " No , I do n't see , " Strang said equably . He rubbed Cecilia 's cheek gently . " Come on , " he told her , wakening her fully  --  she had drowsed almost into sleep . " You 're a stubborn man , " Pringle told him . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I hope not . And I 'm not stubborn , either . Just someone who does n't like being played for a sucker , " Strang said with a grin . " Look  --  " Pringle began worriedly . " Good night , my friend . " Strang helped Cecilia out of the car . Then , thinking that he owed Pringle more of a warning than that , he ducked his head inside the car again to say , " And do n't believe everything that Alexander Christophorou tells you . " " Oh ? " The question was sharply pointed . " No answer to that  --  as yet . " " You and Zafiris make a strange pair , " Pringle said slowly . " ' That 's why he came to my apartment , you know : to warn me sideways . " His normally pleasant and amiable face was hardened by anugly frown . " I do n't believe either of you , " he said flatly , " but I 'll I listen . " And that is something , Strang thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He slipped his arm through Cecilia 's and headed toward the hotel . The hotel porter handed Strang both bulky keys . " I hope you had a pleasant evening , " he said politely . Strang was equally polite . " Very pleasant , " he assured the porter cheerfully , and led Cecilia across the half-lit lobby to the darkened elevator . For a brief moment , the porter 's eyes followed them with tired approval ; it looked as if they had had a very pleasant evening . He was now quite accustomed to that look of bland triumph combined with disarming innocence : people were always so convinced that no sharp eye could guess . He shook his head over the dissimulations of lovers  --  if only men would put as much energy into their business as they did into disguising their adventures , there would be a surfeitof millionaires  --  switched off some more light in the lobby , and went back to adding up his stamp receipts . " There 's no need , " Cecilia protested , but not too hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only twenty yards to go . I 'll manage that . " " I 'll just make sure you do . " He unlocked her door and recognized the little room . " So they gave you the Petit Trianon ? Well , you 'll have pretty pink dreams . Do you mind if I look around ? " She sat down in the nearest velvet chair , slipped off her shoes , and sighed with pleasure . Next time I go exploring in the Plaka , she thought , I sha n't wear three-inch spikes for heels . Strang did n't take long with his tour of inspection . " You 're sure there 's no one under the bed ? " she teased him . " Ken  --  you really have to stop worrying about me . " " That 's my pleasure , ma'am . " " Besides , there 's a balcony , right over the main street , outside my bedroom . If anyone scares me , I just run out there and scream . " " You 'd be quite a sensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that gossamer nightdress which had been so artistically draped by an enchanted maid over the turned-back sheet of her bed . Then , brusquely , partly to shake off the memory , " Two things before I go , Cecilia . You said something , tonight , about the reason why Katherini 's father and brother were killed . What was it , ex  --  actly ? "  |p237Oh  dear , she thought , we 're back there again . She said , " Her brother had a girl in Athens . When he returned from Yugoslavia with his father , they were told to stay out of sight in a house near Delphi . But he came secretly into Athens . The father followed his son , tried to get him back to Delphi instead of reporting him right away . So they were liquidated . I 've got the place where the bodies were found written down in the notes . And the dates of their missioninto Yugoslavia . Katherini did n't know much more about it than that , though . " So , Strang thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had lost control of his son , both had become liabilities , and they were dead . " That 's strong discipline , " he said . But was that how their organization had remained so secret ? Where , then , did Madame Etienne Duval stand when she lost control of her niece ? Where did Nikos Kladas , whose name had been placed on the police files ever since the Megara road murders , and who could be identified as Sideros by Ottway and Steve ? Yet , neitherDuval nor Nikos Kladas had been expecting death tonight . Or perhaps terrorist leaders had one set of rules for their followers , another for themselves . They could always persuade themselves that they were too important , too necessary for the ultimate success of their plans . But someone tonight had thought they were more of a liability than they were indispensable . " And the second thing ? " she reminded him gently . And then , she thought , I can get to bed and sleep and sleep and sleep ... . The word was too soothing , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawn and concentrated on sharper consonants : keep awake , keep awake ! " In your notes about Drakon , I saw some place names . " " Syria , where he visited her aunt , twice , for long periods . They also met in Alexandria , in Paris , and  --  about a week ago  --  in Taormina . " " In the house where Katherini was staying with Maria and a chauffeur ? Who was the chauffeur , did she say ? " " Nikos Kladas . " " The house with the almond tree in its garden , " he said softly . No wonder Ottway had been so interested in it . But even Ottway had to sleep . " I suppose the meeting there was by night ? " " Yes . Madame Duval drove in from Messina , where she was stayingon board her yacht . Drakon was staying somewhere in Taor-tnina. "  | " Somewhere ? " " Katherini did n't know exactly . " He sat , staring at the pink-velvet chair in front of him , rememberinga monk 's converted cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cecilia said . He kept wondering about that , too . He forced himself to sound confident . " Any girl who can slip away as expertly as she did has a pretty good chance of survival . She has quick brains and a lot of courage . " " But you were worried about her  --  or you would n't have gone down that staircase after her . " " She got away safely . That was the main thing . " " You really thought she might have been caught ? " There was an unexpected note of alarm in Cecilia 's voice . " If there had been a guard at Drakon 's back door  --  yes , she 'd have had it . " " And what good would you have been , Kenneth Strang , without a weapon or anything ? " She was almost angry . " Oh , you men ! " she said . " You all think you are indestructible ! " He looked at her in amazement . " You know , " she said , trying to sound very matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own to finish . " But C. L. Hillard was n't able to take over . Cecilia tried to smile . " Or do we ? " She did n't sound too sure about that . " Yes , " he said . " We 'll finish it . " He gave an encouraging grin . and rose . " I 've an appointment at ten tomorrow morning . What about lunch together ? " " If I 'm awake by that time , " she said doubtfully as she followed him to the door . " Tell you what , I 'll meet you for lunch at five o'clock . " " Getting into proper Mediterranean habits , are n't you ? " That 's better , he thought , watching her face . " Keep this door locked , " he said . " I do n't want you walking in your sleep . " Good , he thought again , as she nodded seriously and then began to smile . For a moment , his hand on the door , he looked down at her . Without her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have very pretty feet , " he told her , and bent clown and kissed her cheeks . She had a very pretty mouth , too , but this was hardly the night to start anything he could n't stop . " That 's what the French do when they pin a medal on you . I 'm pinning a very big one , right now . " He stepped quickly through the narrowly opened door , and drew it quietly closed behind him . For almost a minute , he waited , listening ,  |p239There  was n't a sound from the other side of the door . Had she forgotten to lock it , after all ? Then he heard the safety catch click sharply , and she moved away . He started along the corridor to the staircase . As he passed the half-closed pantry door , not far from Cecilia 's room , the mild clatter of plates halted him . He looked inside the pantry , where a waiter was arranging breakfast trays . " Are you on duty all night ? I wonder if you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly dressed man sitting in the corner behind the pantrydoor . With its dark grave eyes , thick black hair , thin black mustache , it was a face he had seen a thousand times in Athens ; but with its slight hint of polite amusement around the lips and its small warning of recognition in the quick twitch of an eyebrow , it was the face that had studied his wallet in the hall of Tommy 's house . " That 's all right , " he told the waiter , added " Good night ! " and left . Perhaps , he was thinking as he slowly climbed the staircase through the silent hotel , I 'll be able to spend the next four and a half hours in some real sleep . It was a blissful prospect.  |p240Colonel  Zafiris seemingly , and rather surprisingly , had his office within walking distance of the Grande Bretagne . It was a sparkling , clear morning with a benign spring sun touching lightly on the hare heads in the crowded street . Strang , only half awakened by his shower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cool , golden air had lifted his headache , opened both his eyes , and put him into an almost amiable mood , something that had seemed totally impossible three quarters of an hour ago . Elias , keeping thirty paces or so ahead , cut his way quickly through the streams of people . Strang just managed to stay within seeing distanceof the neat , dark bobbing head . Suddenly , the head vanished , swept away in the current , through a colonnaded entrance into an arcade of shops . Strang entered the arcade . I 've lost him , he was thinking worriedly . But Elias was standing in front of a tobacconist 's highly polishedwindow . As Strang appeared , he went into the shop . All right , thought Strang , I buy some cigarettes , too . He followed Elias . " You first , " Elias said politely to Strang , and nodded to a door at the back of the shop . The owner of the shop did n't even seem to be aware that Strang existed , busy as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat stacks . Strang obeyed Elias , anti went quickly through the door . After that , there was only one directionto follow : up . A circular iron staircase was all that was con. tained behind the door . Up he went , curiosity and humor beginning to reassert them  --  selves . At the top of the round-and-round , **30;2214;TOOLONG there was a bleak corridor . And this , decided Strang , is where I stop . He leaned against an unprepossessing buff-colored wall , studied the long empty passage lit by a window at its far end , decided that the window looked out onto an interior courtyard judging by the dimness of its light , listened , could hear not even the distant clack of a typewriter , gave up trying to guess . Four minutes later , he heard light footsteps running up the stairs toward him . It was Elias , all right , with a nod of approval for the patient American . It was fortunate , at that moment , that Elias , with all his innumerable gifts , had n't the knack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stairs , Elias seemed to be quite content with an unpretentious brown door markedAMFISSA OLIVES EXPORT COMPANY . Inside , there was a small room , windowless , green-shaded light bulbs over two men at large typewriters , two telephones on their desks , a wall of filing cabinets , two wooden chairs , and another brown door leading into an inner room . " Sit ! " said Elias , and disappeared through the plain brown door . It was exactly one minute before ten o'clock . Elias was not only careful ; he delivered on time . The two typists inspected Strang politely ( or memorized ? ) and went back to their work . Elias appeared at the brown door and led him through the inner office ( three walls of filing cabinets , several telephones , one man writing at a desk ) into a third room . In the middle of the bare wooden floor was a large table covered at one end with paper folders which a clerk seemed to be arranging for a game of solitaire . Three wooden chairs stood at attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream-colored , stood a shoulder-high safe , a small filing cabinet , another door ( which looked much more important than the one Strang had used ) , a collection of large-scale maps of Greece and adjacent countries , a blackboard , and  --  tucked into a corner  --  a low army cot with a neatly folded , gray blanket on its thin mattress . There was a window in this room , but the outside shutters were propped at an angle that would discourage any curious eyes from across the courtyard . The rest of the floor space was occupied with people  --  the clerk at the table ; another man bringing in a tray of coffee cups ; Colonel Zafiris , looking remarkably wide awake , carefully shaven , crisp in a fresh khaki shirt ; Elias , unexpectedly nervous ; and the slightly embarrassed Strang . For it was a strange feeling , like standing in the center of one of the rooms at the Benaki Museum , to have fourp242pairs of Byzantine eyes all focused on him at once . Then the clerk and Elias left , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morose and heavy face was lightened by a fleeting smile . He edged around the loaded table and shook hands with politeformality . " Our interpreter , " he said , waving a hand to the man who was grouping the three chairs beside the coffee cups . Strang nodded , noted that the interpreter was offering him the chair nearest to an outsize wooden cigarette box , smiled , and said , " Hardly necessary . Your command of English is excellent . " " Thank you . It was one of the few compensations for six years of exile . Now , are we all ready ? " Indeed we are , thought Strang as he took the offered chair and glanced away from the wooden box almost at his elbow . What if I ask for a cigarette and reach out to lift that lid ? But the Colonel took care of that by pulling out a neat white cardboard box of Papastratoscigarettes from the table drawer and pushing it over to Strang along with an ash tray advertising a Dutch airline . " Now , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee , lighting a Papastratos , looking down at a page of typescript in front of him , taking quiet but complete charge . They had gone crisply over Katherini 's information , point by point . Strang enlarged where he could , keeping his own additions as brief as possible , while the interpreter listened intently and the Colonel scribbled occasional notes of his own on the broad margin of the typed page in front of him . At the end , he handed the page to the interpreter . " Have copies sent to the others , at once , " he said in Greek . The interpreter rose and left . " And bring more colfee , " the Colonel called after him . Then he looked at Strang , relaxed , and stretched his arms to fold his hands behind his head . " That was n't so bad , was it ? " he asked . " Nor so long , either , " he added , and Strang , who had been stealing a quick glance at his watch , gave a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his head , and reached casually for one of the paper folders . As he opened it and selected a couple of sheets from the top of its file , he was saying , " Can we believe Katherini Roilos ? What was her reason , or her motive , for breaking with her aunt ? " Strang told him . " And how did you come to meet her , in the first place ? " Strang told him that , too.  |p243The  Colonel said , in the same quiet voice , his body still relaxed , his face placid , " Why do n't you take off your jacket , Mr. Strang , and make yourself comfortable ? It 's a very good American habit . And now , tell me  --  I am sometimes slow to understand so many involved details  --  all the little things that happened and brought you , one by one , to my office here this morning . " Strang looked at him quickly . " Just what do you want to know ? " " Everything to do with Stefanos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " His voice drifted away . " You must forgive me , Mr. Strang . There are many questions I must ask out of sheer curiosity . Perhaps the easiest and quickest way to answer them would be simply to tell me your story . " His hand , upturned , weighed that suggestion . " After all , Mr. Strang , I did meet you in rather strange circumstances last night . Do you blame me for being curious ? " " No , " Strang admitted frankly . " But I 'll have to go a long way back  --  to New York harbor , in fact . Just after I had heard about the girl who come to Perspective 's office  --  " " Our stories always start a long way back . Longer , " the Colonel said sadly , " than most of us realize . " He frowned as the door opened , but relaxed into approval . The interpreter had returned , bringing a large discolored coppercoffeepot . The Colonel poured carefully , settled himself at anotherangle in his hard wooden chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The telling was fairly simple , partly because he had already told this story  --  or most of it  --  to Cecilia , partly because he had been eating , drinking , breathing it for the last forty-eight hours . The Colonel listened without comment . There was no change of expression on his face . But , halfway through , his eyes left Strang 's face and fell , quite casually , on the two sheets of paper lying before him . Strang had almost forgotten them . Now , quietly , unobtrusively , the Colonel was reading their contents as Strang talked . Yet , he was listening . Strang was disconcerted enough to stop and light another Papastratos . The two things are connected , he decided as Ile snapped his lighter closed : what he is reading , what I am talking about . Strang continued , recounting Christophorou 's visit to his room at the Grande Bretagne and the disclosure of the conspiracy , the news of Steve 's death and the surrender of Steve 's documents . But when he described the following evening with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seemed to be listeningp244with doubled intensity ; perhaps his comparison between what he had read and what he had heard had made him twice as interested . " And so we arrived at Tommy 's doorstep , " Strang ended . " He took us inside . I telephoned Pringle . You know the rest . " There was a pause . The Colonel frowned at his desk , then looked at the interpreter . " We need more coffee , Yorghis , and more ciga-rettes . " Yorghis , a tall , thin man with a highly intelligent nose and a recedinghairline which turned his high brow into a formidable precipice , took the coffeepot and said , " I shall fill the cigarette box , too . " He left , with extreme speed , carrying the box carefully . So , thought Strang , the recording session has been completed . " My right-hand man , " the Colonel said , watching the door close . " Not at all like the Yorghis you mentioned . " He laughed . " Did you see his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusementwas over . He picked up the two sheets of paper . " I noticed you gave me only the facts . No opinions . No judgments . Why ? " " I do n't know enough of the facts to start making comments . " " But you must have formed some opinions . A man must ask the reasons why . Is that not so ? " " Yes . " " What is your opinion of Alexander Christophorou ? " Strang lit another cigarette very carefully . The Colonel said , " You must have asked why you saw him yesterdayevening leaving a house on Kriton Street which Kat1ieriniRoilos identified as the one rented for her aunt by Evgenia Vasilika . Miss Hillard saw him , too ? There is no doubt that it was he ? " " None . " " Then why ? You asked yourself that question , I am sure . What was your answer ? " " I keep thinking Christophorou must be a double agent . " he looked up quickly and surprised a look of astonishment . " That could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for us . " " But is n't he attached to  --  to some intelligence unit ? " The Colonel asked sharply , " Did he tell you he was ? " " No , " Strang said slowly . " Did he give you that impression ? "  |p245Strang  hesitated . " Perhaps I was too quick in picking it up . He told me , actually , that he was a journalist . " " And that is what he is , neither more nor less . " " But why was he in Sicily ? Where did he get all his information ? " " Very interesting questions . " The Colonel did n't answer them , though . " Why , " tried Strang again , " did you listen to him when he told you I had documents to deliver ? Why did he even  --  " " He is a good journalist . And good journalists are detectives , too . They have informants , they check the stories they hear , they can discover vital facts . And when they come across something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make contact with official sources . Their discoveries , in other words , can be too dangerous to be treated as ordinary news . Supposing you were a journalist , Mr. Strang , and discovered a serious plot to assassinate your president . What do you do ? Burst into headlines and become famous ? Or do you give that information to your Secret Service and I.B.I. ? And let them find out the whole plot , and arrest the plotters , and end the danger to your country , before you publish what you know ? It is a matter of ethics . Personal gain or public service ? That is the question . So , two nights ago , when Christophorou made contact with me and my colleague , we were interested , curious . But not astounded . Any reliable journalist would have followedthe same course . You understand ? " " Yes . But what puzzles me is the fact that the documents were handed over to you . It would have been easier just to take them  --  " Ile halted , remembering that there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . But more dangerous , too . The sudden death of another American would have caused serious complications . You did not give up those documents easily . You were very tenacious . " The Colonel paused . " Why ? You were not in a trusting mood , last Monday . I think you had some doubts about Alexander Christophorou , even then . Am I right ? Please do not look so embarrassed , so very unhappy . After all , in your work with ancient ruins you are something of a detective , too . Perhaps you like to make reconstructions of people as well as of temples ? Tell me ( rankly , off the record as you say in America : do you think Drakon k only another name for Christophorou ? " The Colonel , thought Strang , had his own technique for the raw wound : first , the lanolin ; then , the sudden jab of iodine . He said ,  | " Does it matter what I think ? My ideas wo n't interest any court of law . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search for proof , " the Colonel said coldly . " If we do not think , we do not find reasons for doubt . If we do not doubt , we do not start the search for proof . Oh , we 'll find the proof of either innocence or guilt , if we work hard enough and have enough time . But without thinking , doubting , we would not know even where to begin our work . You understand ? " " Katherini Roilos could give you the proof . Let her meet Christophorou . She can tell you whether he is Drakon or not . " The Colonel looked at him searchingly . Then he sighed , and stretched out his arm to a bell on his table . He frowned , as he jabbed its button . He said sadly , " It is a little more complicated than that , Mr. Strang . " Yorghis opened the door at once . He had the copper coffeepot in his hand . " Is it cold ? " the Colonel wanted to know . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs . " The orders were almost conversational . Strang drank the hot , sweet coffee cautiously . You had to be careful to leave almost an inch of liquid at the bottom of the little cup if you did n't want a last mouthful of delta mud . He watched the Colonel with equal care . Those two sheets of paper were still in his hand . Casually , the Colonel held them up . " This is the report made to us , yesterday , by Alexander Christophorou . It is a statement of how he became interested in Stefanos Kladas , and discovered that certaindocuments , which might be of some importance to us , were in your hands . " The Colonel studied the two sheets of paper for a long moment . " Not one word of your story , Mr. Strang , coincides with his . " The coffee silt touched Strang 's teeth . He put down the cup hastily , and found his handkerchief to clean his lips . " You must not drink our coffee so trustingly , Mr. Strang . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , perhaps a few words  --  where he says he was visiting Taormina and renewed an old friendship . But after that  --  " The Colonel consulted the top sheet again . " You were extremely worried about the nonappearance of Stefanos Kladas . You asked Christophorou'sadvice , and in return , over several drinks , you told him everything that Stefanos Kladas had confided in you . Including  --  " the Colonel raised his eyes , opened them wide , and smiled  --  " allp247that Stefanos Kladas knew about a conspiracy in which his brother , Nikos , was implicated . " Strang said softly , " And that is how Christophorou came to know about the conspiracy ? " The Colonel nodded and sipped his coffee . Strang could only stare at Christophorou 's report . My word against his , he thought grimly . " Only , " the Colonel said , slapping the two sheets down on the table , " how could Stefanos Kladas , in New York , have known such vivid details about the murder of the Roilos father and son on the Megara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nikos . That is obvious from the two letters from the sister , Myrrha Kladas , to Stefanos Kladas in New York that were among the documents he gave you . The first letter was written last November , after she had received a secret visit from Nikos . She was worried about Nikos then . In a letter written last February , she seemed to have become frightened about Nikos . She hoped Stefanos could persuade him to stay clear of his old friends , who always led him into trouble . " " Yes , " Strang said bitterly , " he always was a good boy . " The Colonel , who probably had little time to read New York newspaper reports on juvenile delinquents and their doting mamas , looked momentarily perplexed . Then , " Yorghis , please get Elias to come in here . I want him to see this , too . " And when Elias stood within the door , the Colonel said , " Now , Yorghis  --  are we ready ? " Yorghis was ready . The screen was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He closed the window 's shutters completely . The small room was dark and warm , smelling of aromaticcoffee , delicate cigarettes , starched shirts , and hair oil . " But first , " said the Colonel , now that the shutters were closed , " perhaps you should see the actual photographs , before our experts went to work on them . " He switched on the table lamp , scattered some small snapshots from an envelope into the little pool of light . Strang rose and examined them : the usual aging snapshots , not too defined , not much variety in light and shade , not too clear . But , even then , Steve 's sense of composition had been good . " Do they make any sense to you ? " the Colonel asked . " None . " Just people under trees , a group beside a burned-out house . " What 's this fellow doing ? Cleaning a rifle ? " " You 'll see . " The Colonel was delighted . He switched off the fable light ; they sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of photographs , blown up top248enormous proportion , coarsened in texture , but with outlines and shadows skillfully sharpened . Faces had become real , actions understandable . Yorghis , in the dispassionate voice of a research scholar , first analyzed the backgrounds to suggest the possible localities ( Steve had been clever at using the shape of a mountain , a ruined church , a high-perched village above a precipice , even eagles circlingover cliffs , to identify the scenes ) , and then explained the groups of men in the foregrounds . The photographs seemed to deal with one small district of Greece : the slopes of Mount Parnassos and the area surrounding them . The men were andartes , the guerrillafighters , bundled into bulky shapes by strange mixtures of clothing  --  captured uniforms , tattered civilian jackets , sheepskin tunics as wild as their hair and beards , wool caps , twists of knitted scarves , anything to keep out the savage cold of the mountains . Sometimes they were returning from a raid , sometimes jubilant around a few captured weapons . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straggling as they climbed a rough mountainside , or resting as they lay under a sheltering tree . " These photographs were included , " Yorghis was saying , " presumably to identify the area of operations against the Nazis . Here is one , dealing with a less-heroic operation in this same area . The season is different , you will note from the trees and the hillside . There are other differences . The commander of this band of guerrillasis Ares . There he is , with his men . The bodies which are lying scattered on the sloping meadow are Greeks , too . Their commanding officer , Colonel Psarros , lies with them . The few survivors stand with hands held up in surrender . " The photograph flashed on the screen . The dead were scattered ; the survivors , in a pathetic small group ; the victors , in considerable force . To get this scene , Steve had taken a distance shot . Only the gestures of the men were discernible . In clothes , they were the same . Faces could n't be distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now four of the survivors were on view : three ghostlike , bewildered faces ; the fourth head . with a battered old cap pulled down rakishly over his brow , was bent slightly as the man lit a cigarette . He wore , so it looked , an officer 's long coat . " And now , " said Yorghis as he flashed another photograph onto the screen , " the survivors who refused to join Ares are executed . One changes his mind just before he is shot , and breaks away to join the victors . They find it amusing . " The man did not . He was weep/ing . He was a big man , powerful . His face was contorted with anguishand tears . " A shepherd in ordinary life , perhaps , " Yorghis 's calm voice went on . " So we have been told . Name unknown as yet , but identified by his light hair , height , and that sheepskin tunic which he always wore . And now , in the next picture , those who are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was scarcely the word . The new photograph showed a straggle of men , melting away from the meadow with its abandoned dead . It had focused on that rakishly tilted , battered old cap again . ( Steve must have taken a dislike to its owner . ) And again the head had avoided a clear picture . " Until we saw these photographs , " Yorghis said , " we had thought no officer had surrendered . But this one did . Notice that the shepherd is following him faithfully . Notice , too , that one of Ares 's men has come over to talk to that officer . They walk together . Look carefully : the friendly man is Sideros . " Indeed it was . Sideros had not had much success with a beard . The face of Nikos Kladas , turning toward the camera in surprise , was not too difficult to recognize . " And last of all , a picture taken at a rest camp some months later , judging by the clothes . Locality undiscovered . But this is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been closely associated with Arcs . Most of them died with him , in 1945 . " The men had left off their bulky clothing , except for the shepherd , who still wore his sheepskin tunic . Most of them were smiling as they sat around a glade , except for the shepherd again , a desolate crag of a man , who stood in the background . One had even stripped , and was lying asleep , face down in full sunlight . " Sideros , the sun-worshiper , " Yorghis said bitingly . " Notice that mark below his right shoulder blade . Definitely identified by a British liaison officer who knew Sideros before he joined Ares 's special unit . " Strang looked sharply at Colonel Zafiris beside him . The Colonel , who had grunted his approval of the earlier guerrilla photographs , had lapsed into complete silence since the massacre of Colonel Psarros and his men . Now , he only gestured back to the screen , as Yorghis said , " Notice this small group sitting apart from the others . " Strang took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his amazingly quick response to Tommy 's message , and looked at the screen obediently . At the side of the glade , there was the wall of a house , and in its shallow shadow sat three people . One was a man with a handsome face , laughing . Anotherwas the officer with the battered old cap , tilted more thanp250ever over his eyes to shield them from the glare of late summer while he cleaned a rifle . And the third was small , slight , with a large head of wild dark hair around a smooth face . " A woman ? " Strang asked incredulously . " A woman , " said the Colonel . " A courier . A very special courier . " He lapsed into silence again , glowered at the screen , where a detail of the group by the house wall was now being shown . Yorghis said , " Reading from left to right : Ares , the god of war ; Odysseus ; Elektra . Ares , we all know . Odysseus and Elektra were identified by the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand  --  and met the famous Elektra , who was so close an intimate of Ares at one time . " Strang studied the detail . Coarse-textured as it was by excessive enlargement , it still held a recognizable quality . The woman 's excellentprofile could be noted , a long slender neck above her opened shirt collar , a noble brow . She made him think of Katherini Roilos . " Strong family resemblance . " " Especially then , " said the Colonel , " when her hair was dark brown . And Odysseus  --  can you recognize him ? " " I ca n't see beyond that beard , or that tilted cap . A careful cus-tomer . " " Unfortunately , for us . " " Never seen at close hand , " Strang repeated , thoughtfully . " He kept his distance from the Englishman . Why ? Is it possible that he felt he might meet the Englishman after the war ? Could they have friends in common in the civilian world ? He was wellnamedOdysseus . " The Colonel was watching Strang now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you see that heavy ring on his little finger ? " " Vaguely . " And , vaguely , something stirred at the back of Strang 's memory . " Thank you , Yorghis . " The Colonel switched on the table lamp . " Here , " he said to Strang , " is the face design of that ring , as near as we can manage to reconstruct it . It is actually a coin , thick , unevenedge , not a circle , with a design of a man 's profile and two horns . Perhaps an ancient drachma ? Fourth century ? The head of Alexander the Great ? " " It could be , " Strang said as he studied the neat drawing of the ring 's design . Its irregular edge , clipped carefully away from its original circle by some acquisitive Greek who did n't think the merest sliver of silver too small for the taking , was typical of mostp251ancient coins . The two short horns protruding from the scalp , or from a tight skullcap covering the scalp , were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of Zeus . " Alexander , the conqueror of Greece , the invader from the north , " Zafiris said softly . He filed the drawing of the ring into the proper folder . " Christophorou wears no ring now . Did he wear one when you met him fifteen years ago ? Such a ring is memorable to someone like you , with your interest in ancient things . You said you met him in the Grande Bretagne when it was under siege . " " He did n't wear a ring in the Grande Bretagne . Of course , the it lights were n't too good then . " Just candles , batteries , oil lamps . Still , there had been light enough to notice a ring like that . " Not in the Grande Bretagne , " he repeated . The vague stirring in Strang 's memory began again . " Then where ? " " That night , after Christophorou and I had gone up to the Acropolis , we got back to the Piraeus road to join my friends waiting for me there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck so far , and hoped it would last . He said it would : his lucky ring had never let him down yet . I only saw a glimpse of it . It was scarcely the time to stop and look . We were too busy dodging patrols and armed bands and snipers . " " How much of a glimpse did you have ? " " I only saw a ring . " " On his left hand ? " Strang tried to remember . " He lifted his hand as he spoke about his luck . . . . No , I ca n't remember which hand . " " Was he carrying a revolver ? " " Of course . " " In his right hand ? " " Yes . " " Was that the one he held up ? " " No . " " So  --  " the Colonel said , and glanced quickly at Yorghis . " Now , 1VIr . Strang , are you sure you did n't notice the ring was different from an ordinary signet ring ? " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he mentioned a lucky ring . And held up his left hand for a second as he spoke . Then we moved on . That 's all . " " And not enough , " the Colonel said , angry with disappointment . Then he recovered himself . " Yorghis , " he said in lightning Greek ,  | " we shall have to try some of Christophorou 's old friends . The Englishman , Thomson , for instance . Or his family . They may know about a ring like that . " " Shall we send Elias ? " Yorghis looked at the little man who was standing so quietly in the background that Strang was startled to see him . " I need Elias , " the Colonel said . " Costas , then ? " " It will take all his diplomacy . Brief him carefully . " Yorghis nodded , locked the photographs into the box he carried . " At least , we do know that Christophorou wore a ring on his left hand , " he said , suddenly cheerful , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door for a moment . " Odysseus , " he said with a sardonic smile , " Odysseus . . . Why not Alcibiades ? " The Colonel gave an abrupt laugh . " Why not ? " he asked as the door closed . " But men always choose the more flattering names . " Then he looked at Strang , and said , serious again , " A slow business . Step by step . Small details , such as that ring , become important . Big discoveries become of little value . Constant bouleversement . Yet , step by step , the climb is made . And at last , the full view . What shall we see ? " That 's one view I wo n't enjoy , Strang thought heavily . " It would not be such a slow business , " the Colonel said , " if we had Katherini Roilos to help us . " Strang stopped thinking about Alexander Christophorou and looked up quickly as he heard the stilted voice . " But , " the Colonel said , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long moment . " How ? " he asked at last . " Where ? " " In the Kriton Street house . She arrived by taxi , and was observedby two of our agents , whom I had sent there , just after your telephone call to Pringle , to keep watch until reinforcements arrived . Two agents , you understand , were not enough to force their way into a house of that size and make arrests . They thought she was another of the conspirators , that they would arrest her , inside , along with the others . None of us knew , you realize , that your little witness had left Mr. Thomson 's flat . When the squad of men arrived , twenty minutes later , the house was surrounded . An entry was forced through the garden door , which the girl had used . There were several people inside , mostly in their night clothes , as if they had been roused from their beds . There was a man at a telephone  --  much confusion  --  a woman 's voice screaming Traitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they burst into the room . The girl was dead before they could reach her , stabbed to the heart . She had been tied to a chair and  --  I am afraid  --  cruelly questioned . " The Colonel 's lips tightened . He stared down at his desk . " There was a woman standing over her , still screaming in anger , her hand on the hilt of the knife . " Strang stared at him unbelievingly . " A woman called Maria , " the Colonel said . " Maria ? " The Colonel nodded . " But Maria helped her escape . Maria  --  " "  --  was only obeying orders throughout . The girl had come under suspicion . Her escape to Erinna Street was permitted so that she could be followed , so that her associates could be traced . The troubleabout conspirators is that they must always look for counterplots ; they find it hard to believe that one girl , alone , might rebel and act . A brave girl . Not brave enough to give testimony in publicagainst her aunt  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . But , still , very brave . " I was so sure , Strang thought , I was so sure she would get away safely . He said , " She was worried about Maria . She went back to that house to help Maria . " " That could be the reason she gave herself , and a good reason it was . But behind the reason we give , there often stands the reason we do not acknowledge . " The Colonel 's eyes dropped down to the two sheets of paper he was inserting into the proper folder . He was impatient to proceed with something other than Kriton Street . " Now  --  " he began , and stopped as he looked up at the American . " Mr. Strang , " he said sharply , " the girl would have died in that chair in any case . Perhaps it was a mercy to her that we arrived sosoon after she entered that house . " Strang nodded . But he could n't get rid of his feeling of guilt . Get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you ought to know that the raid was successful , " the Colonel said quickly . " Five people were arrested , including the man who stole the Kiadas documents from my office .  --  Oh , no , not this office , Mr. Strang !  --  He is a Bulgarian , answers your description of Boris very nicely . Oh , such innocence ! Such delightful ignorance of everything . But then , he does not know that we watched him hand over the stolen envelope last night just after the theft . In ap254coffeehouse . " The Colonel enjoyed that picture . Then he went on , " This morning , such innocent tradesmen delivered the household supplies ! A most successful raid . " He looked at Strang and seemed puzzled . " Her death is not meaningless . Already , it is partly avenged . " " She would never have been under suspicion if I had not told Christophorou about her , " Strang said angrily . " I 'm to blame . I told him . Damn him to hell , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " His eyes met the Colonel 's . " Who else knew ? Your editor in New York . Stefanos Kladas . Who else ? " " I told Miss Hillard . " The Colonel raised an eyebrow . " Do you know her so well ? " " Yes . " " I thought you only met her yesterday , " the Colonel suggested politely . " You did n't ask how long I had known her . " " Ah ! " There was a slight pause , a humorous pursing of the lips . " I do n't think Miss Hillard can be blamed . Who else was told ? " " No one . " " Which leaves  --  " The Colonel 's hands dropped to the desk . " Yes , " said Strang slowly . " So , at last , you do not find my doubts about Alexander Christophorouexaggerated . " The Colonel shook his head unbelievingly . There , just when he had given up all hope of getting the American to admit his doubts openly , it had happened . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange keys turned the lock in a man 's subconsciousmind . Strang said with painful honesty , slowly , still unwillingly , " I have had my doubts . But no positive proof . And -- well , it 's hard to be-lieve . " " Because a gallant stranger took you to see the Acropolis under shellfire ? The romantic gesture  --  yes , that is always appealing . " Strang flushed . " I 've sweated that nonsense out of my system in the last twenty-four hours . No . What I ca n't believe is  --  " He paused . " How could a man who saw his family forced into a death march ever join the people who seized them as hostages ? That just does n't make sense . " " He was already allied with them . You saw the photographs . " " But  --  " Strang fell silent . The Colonel watched him curiously . Americans , he thought , livep255in a simple world of good and bad , every man considered good until he was caught , actually caught , flagrante delicto if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so comfortable , so pleasant . And then he did n't envy it : too vulnerable , too easy for any dedicated enemy to smash it to pieces . Perhaps Americans did not believe in the dedicated enemy , either . Yet they admired Shakespeare , some of them at least : did Othello leave no sense of disquiet , was Iago simply an odd phenomenon , an unpleasant quirk of a dramatist 's imagination ? Some admired Aeschylus , too , he had heard : did the intellectuals who applauded the Agamemnon think that Aegisthus was only quaint fiction ? Or Atreus himself  --  was his evil simply a part of barbarous prehistory ? Progress made evil antiquated . Was that the assumption ? The Colonel sighed . " Must Alcibiades be understood in order to be believed ? He did exist , my friend , understood or not understood . And , as you Americans say , he could n't have cared less . " " But did n't Christophorou feel revulsion ? " " Revulsion from everything , perhaps . From the stupid democrats , who were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see danger until it swallowed them up . From the stupid fascists , who bullied and murdered . From the stupid Communists , with their obsessive hates , their blind obedience . Revulsion from all of them . Many men have felt it . Complete disillusion , bitterness , contempt . Life is absurd , meaningless . " The Colonel 's broad , capable hands gathered the folders on his desk into neat order , boxed them into an exact square . " But few men have followed existentialismto its logical conclusion . Which is  --  " The Colonel looked up and caught Strang 's eye . " Ah , " he said , " I see you are not ignorant of nihilism . " His heavy , oval face , with its drooping eyelids , its full lips drawn into a severe line under the thick black mustache , its strong eyebrows no longer arched but knitted straight by the deep crease between them , stared impassively at the American . " I think we have one of those few , right here in Athens , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the table and rose . Strang rose , too . " There are two less now , " he said . " The Duval woman and Nikos Kladas ? " The Colonel 's hand brushed that idea aside . " Stalinists , both of them , with a taste for terrorism . They formed a Committee of Three with Drakon , to organize this conspiracy . It is an old pattern , that Committee of Three , with the two Communists taking over as soon as the thirdp256man 's usefulness is ended . It happened throughout our civil war . But Drakon knew how they worked : he was a Communist filmset ! then . Last night , he acted first . The sole power is now his . Why did he choose last night ? Because tomorrow is the day that the first blow is struck . " The Colonel turned and pointed to the map of Greece on the wall behind him . " There ! " he said . " Just across that northern boundary , in Yugoslavia , the trouble will start . An assassination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then false charges , with specially prepared proof , that Greece is responsible . Border incidents will develop . And then -- - " the Colonel 's hand swept south into Greece  --  " attacks . Trouble will come from the Bulgarian border , too . From Albania . The Greek Communists are there , ready . And they will have considerable assistance , this time . In 1944 , the Russians had no tanks or guns to spare . " He stared at the map . " Is this why the Duval woman joined Drakon ? Was this the gamble ? " With his finger , he drew one last line over the map , from the Baltic and East Germany down through the heart of Europeto the Adriatic , sweeping " around Greece to end at the Dardanelles . He swung back to face Strang . " So carefully planned , this one . But its two Communist leaders are dead . And all the control is now in the hands of the nihilist . " Suddenly , surprisingly , he was amused . " That is a new development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their rest camps by their Communist comrades . They ought to have had a nihilist in charge to protect their interests . An anarchist is all emotion and no brain . He needs someone like our nihilist , the elusive Mr. Drakon , all brain , no emotions . " His sardonic mood was over . Grimly now , he ended , " But the conspiracywo n't succeed . Not this time ! " " There is still Drakon , " Strang reminded him . The Colonel reached into his desk drawer and took out a revolver . He laid it on top of the pile of folders . " Is this gun dangerous ? " the Colonel asked softly . " If it is loaded . " " Potentially , yes . But actually , no . Not until someone picks it up and puts his finger around the trigger and points it . Like this ! " The Colonel picked up the revolver . " That 's all right , Mr. Strang . I shall try not to shoot you . " He had a smile in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six bullets on the table . " Now , if I were to pick up this gun and put my finger around the trigger ? Yes , indeed , I 'd look very very foolish . And I would be harmless.  |p257Until  I found more ammunition and loaded it once more . " He beganloading , and then dropped the revolver back into place . " A conspiracy is very much like that gun . Drakon will pull the trigger , but the gun is empty . We have removed the bullets , Mr. Strang . The assassination will not take place , simply because there will be no one to murder . The intended victim will not attend . He will be some two hundred miles away , and his change in plans will only be announced just at the time he was supposed to die . In this way , his police will be able to draw a tight net around their conspirators . " " That should be easy . They will find them grouped hopefully in front of their radios . " " And meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we find Drakon , before he reloads . " " Have n't you found him ? " Strang could n't resist asking , and then decided to make no more small jokes . A foreigner 's sense of humor was never much appreciated , somehow . But the Colonel was receptive , this time . " That 's better , much better , " he said , studying Strang 's face . " You must look perfectly normal when you walk along the street . You do not want your friends to ask What is wrong ? What is he worried about ? ' Even expressions on a man 's face can be indiscreet . " There was more than a slight emphasis on that last word . " I 'll be discreet , " Strang assured him . Is it time to leave ? he wondered . He took a step toward the door . " You will find your travel agent , Spyridon Makres , most dependable , now that your little Yorghis has been discharged . They were deeply shocked to hear about his activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peloponnese will be made simple and pleasant . " Strang looked at him . How had the Colonel guessed his plans ? " I thought I ought to go and see Steve 's sister , " he said awkwardly . " Of course . And Miss Hillard ? " " She was going to Nauplion . " " Alone ? " " Yes . But I 'm not so keen on that idea , now . " " I think you had better tell her to stay in Athens , for this week . That would be simpler for everyone . " " Tell her ? " Strang raised an eyebrow . " Certainly . " The Colonel put out his hand and gripped Strang'sin a quick shake . " The Peloponnese is very beautiful in spring , Mr. Strang . The wild flowers cover the hills . A pleasant journey . " And then , just when Strang was about to open the door , thep258Colonel said  --  as if this thought had only developed now  --  " By the way , how did you come to be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American preoccupation , is it ? " " Not exactly . So far , our delinquents have n't branched into poli-tics . " But the Colonel was still waiting for the answer . Strang said , " Christophorou talked of nihilism . " " He did ? " The Colonel had been really surprised , this time . " Yes . " " Have you any comment on that ? " I am flattered , thought Strang . My comment ? " You have a mind that seeks explanations , " the Colonel observed politely . " Yes , even wrong ones , " Strang said with a grin . " But I am serious . " " Well , either Christophorou is so fascinated by nihilism that he ca n't keep it out of his conversation . Or perhaps he thought it would scare me off , make me run back to my drawing board and concentrate thankfully on pleasanter things . Or perhaps I was n't impressed enough : I told him nihilism would n't work , there were still enough civilized men in the world who would reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Or perhaps the excitement of success made him boast a little ? " The Colonel pursed his lips . " We make him sound almost human . " He looked sharply at Strang . " Is that your difficulty ? You find him too human to be the monster I think he is . " Strang said nothing . The Colonel had made an adequate reply , in a way . Colonel Zafiris smiled gently . " I am sure I need not remind you that Hitler and Stalin were known to kiss babies and smile on pretty girls ? " The acid voice changed . " Be careful , Mr. Strang , " he said softly . " Please ! " " Very careful , " Strang agreed . He opened the door . Elias was waiting . Strang followed him into the dingy corridor.  |p259Strang  came out of the arcade slowly , stopping to look at a window of cameras , then at a bookshop . He bought a guide to the Peloponnese , a good map of Greece , and a new edition of Cavafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy his cigarettes in the street outside , at one of the innumerable newspaper and magazine stands . ( Elias had vanished , but if he was taking any distant interest in Strang 's progress along Venizelos Street , he would approve . ) He chose a couple of newspapers , too , and some American , English , and French magazines . The Greeks , he decided as he looked over the incredibledisplay , must read as much as they talked , and drank coffee . The sidewalk tables were filling up , although it was n't yet noon . When the warm weather came , he had heard , they would cover ConstitutionSquare . Considering its size , that must be the biggest concentration of cafe tables this side of Cedar Rapids . If I 'm careful , he thought , remembering the Colonel 's last admonition , I 'll live to see it . In the street 's clear air , bright sunshine , and general feeling of bustling rush and pleasant purpose , it was easy to smile at warnings , not ridiculing them , not forgetting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most careful course to follow would be to act perfectly normally . Today , he would pass these cafe tables ahead of him and cut down toward the big coffeehouse at the corner of Churchill Street . Men only . Talk and cigarette smoke . He would read , and  --  lost among the mass of small round zinc tables  --  think over those last ninety minutes . There was much , as the old Cretan would say , to think about here . Momentarily , he wished he could have a night'sp260talk with that old boy . And thinking of the Cretan , he thought of . Petros and Steve , and of Katherini Roilos . A woman 's hand touched his elbow . " You were n't going to pass me by , were you ? " Caroline Ottway asked . She was wearing her jadegreenearrings today , and a wistful look . A little pale , perhaps , but her soft blonde breathless charm was still gathered around her like yards of gossamer . He was startled enough to be quite frank . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , are n't you ? Oh , do come and sit with me ! I 'm all alone today . " " No Greek lesson ? " " Abandoned by everyone , " she said . " I feel as miserable as you look . " " We 'll have to do something about that , " he told her . The Colonelwas right , damn him : no serious thoughts in a crowded street . He sat down at her table  --  it was on the front row . He must have passed her at less than a yard 's distance . He looked at her bright eyes and thought of Katherini Roilos again , and then forced himself to stop thinking . Caroline was saying , " I 'm so sorry , Kenneth . It is really hideous . " He stared at her . " George felt grim about it all . He heard about it last night , you know . We were dining at the Pringles ' . " She sounded more excited than crushed . Bad news stimulated some people . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had at least three pieces of news that would fit that category . " It 's in the papers . " She nodded to the bundle of newspapers and magazines he had laid on a free chair . " What does it all mean ? It is n't so simple as it seems . Is it ? " Fortunately , the waiter was prompt today , and he could order and quite naturally miss answering . He picked up a newspaper and said , " Let 's see how they treat it . " " Page one , " she told him . " Is n't that significant ? " He nodded , searching , finding . DEATH OF FAMOUS GREEK PHOTOGRAPHER . He read the small paragraph , reminding himself sharply that he would have to guard against showing the truth ; he must rememberconstantly that Steve was supposed to be dead , that Katheriniwas supposed to be alive . " When did you hear about it first ? " she wanted to know . " From Bob Pringle . " " It 's  --  it 's just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered ; you never met Steve.  |p261In  fact , I 'd he willing to swear you were jealous of his shadow . " Is that what George says ? " he asked quickly . She looked at him sideways , green eyes still excited , and then seemed to decide he had meant that nicely . " Yes . In fact , he was so worried by the news that  --  well , he did n't sleep much last night . And this morning  --  " she dropped her voice  --  " he went round to see some friends of his . Greek friends . Intelligence , I think . All very hush-hush and  --  " " Then why talk about it ? " he cut in . " Look , Caroline , " he said very gently , " do n't add to your husband 's troubles . " " I ? " She was hurt , indignant . " And what troubles do you mean ? " she asked , curiosity overcoming her annoyance . He dodged that neatly . " All men with pretty wives and important jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , Caroline . Ease up on your old man . If he ca n't tell you about his work , do n't start inventing problems for him . He 's bound to have plenty of his own . " " But this visit to his Greek friends was not about his problems . It was about Yannis  --  Steve , I mean . " " He probably wants a full inquiry . Not a bad idea , either . Steve was n't likely to commit suicide . " " There 's much more to his death than all this , " she declared , and tapped the newspaper . " And how did you get that fancy idea ? " he asked . She waited until the waiter had set down fresh coffee for her , beer for Strang . Softly , when they were alone again , she said , " Last night , Mr. Pringle had a talk with George about Steve . Then Mr. Christophorou dropped in , and he had a quiet talk with George . Then George lay awake most of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some problem . This morning , he went to see his friends . And when he came back from that visit , he started packing . He has left . For Cyprus . He would only say something about a little difficulty that had come up . He always talks understatementwhen he 's really worried . And so I 'm worried . " She was , too . Strang said more gently , " Now , Caroline  --  you know that 's his job : to ease out any difficulties . " " I know , I know . But  --  " she looked at him  --  " he did n't think of going to Cyprus until he had that meeting with his Greek friends . How do you jump to Cyprus from Steve 's death ? " Not from Steve 's death , Strang thought ; from information abouta conspiracy , perhaps . He remembered , now , the jubilation in thep262Colonel 's voice when he had talked about the raid , a most successful raid , on the Kriton Street house , about the captured and incriminatedBoris . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , too ? Then he shook himself free of his speculations . I 'm as bad as Caroline , he thought angrily , always curious , always questioning . One thing is certain : I 'll never know the full scope of the conspiracy . Neither I nor the millions of people on the outside . Only the insiders , like the Colonel , and not many of them , would ever know the full truth . But the Colonel was stretching even his knowledge when he called Christophorou a monster . " How ? " repeated Caroline , still worrying about Cyprus . " You do n't , " he said , " you just do n't . Unless you are Caroline Ottway . " Her instinct was uncanny , he thought worriedly . " Did you know Steve really well ? I mean  --  " He cut her short . " Let 's not talk about Steve . Not today . " " Nor ever , " she said , challenging him . " Why wo n't you talk about him to me ? " " Because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you really do n't like Steve . You resent him . " " What absolute nonsense ! " Her cheeks were bright with a moment'ssharp confusion . Then she said in surprise , " Steve is dead . How extraordinary to use the present tense about him . " He recovered quickly . " I was talking about you . And you are very much alive . " Her reaction was favorable , and he took a deep breath of relief . " I begin to think you only talk to me because I was a friend of Steve 's . " She shook her head , but the retreat was complete . " Cheer up , " he said , " you 'll soon be in your new apartment , and then you wo n't have time to invent worries over a cafe table . " She tried to smile , but it was a sad effort . Her eyes were too bright . " You must think me a very foolish woman , " she said , looking down at her untouched cup of coffee . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acquaintances , of living in rented furnished flats , hotels , restaurants . I had too much of it when I was young . Now , all I want is quite simple . I 'd like to be able to hear my husband talk over his business , meet his friends , have a real house to worry about , and  --  " she hesitated , ended evasively  --  " everything that goes with a proper home . Is n't life funny ? All I want is so simple  --  " She shrugged her shoulders , laughed a little unsteadily . " Or perhaps I 'm just a morbid type , always wanting what I ca n't get . " She looked at her watch . " Dear me ! It 's time to put in an hour on Greek verbsp263before lunch . I promised Yorghis to get them straight before he gets back from Yugoslavia . " " You are in no mood for verbs today . Have some sherry . " Strang signaled to the waiter . " Yugoslavia ? He wo n't be back for days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better be back before Friday . George and I are going to have a weekend at Delphi  --  probably , that is  --  and I 'll need my camera for my own use . " Then , as Strang looked quickly at her , she added , " What could I do ? Refuse to lend my camera ? But he ca n't afford one , you know . And he did want to take some photographs of the celebrations , tomorrow , in Yugoslavia . There 's some terrific opening of a new highway up there  --  " " He has borrowed your camera ? " Strang interrupted , horrified . Her camera 's serial number would be easily traced . " Oh , I 'll get it back all right . But what could I do when he asked me , so shyly , if he could borrow it ? " " You could have told him to go jump in the Aegean . " She laughed . " How could I ? A foreigner ? And practically a millionairessby Yoi-ghis 's count ? Now do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strang hoped he looked noncommittal . " I do wish people would n't put me in the position of being unable to refuse , though . " She sighed . " If he can afford to take off on a vacation to Yugoslavia , he might have rented his own camera . " " Not on a vacation ; on a job . He is interpreter for some foreign journalist . " The waiter had brought the glass of sherry . She tasted it , doubtfully . " It 's real ! " she said in surprise . " What did your husband have to say about the camera ? " Strang could imagine what Ottway must have said , but the question served to point the conversation back in the right direction . Caroline looked a little vague . " You did not tell him ? " Strang was dumfounded . " Well , what with all the excitement this morning  --  " she began evasively . " Caroline , " he said , " you have one good habit that you had betternever drop . You 're the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You are joking . Surely ? " " Far from it . " " What is so wrong about lending an old camera ? " She was silentp264and worried . At last she said , " It 's all so silly . When George got back this morning from seeing his Greek friends , he was so angry about Yorghis and Evgenia Vasilika that  --  well how could I tell him then about the camera ? " " What did he say about them ? " " I was n't to take any more lessons from Yorghis . " " But you are getting up those damned verbs for your next les-son . " " Just to finish the course , that 's all . The lessons are all paid for . " She is in revolt , Strang thought . A week ago , she would have cut off the lessons at once . " What 's the hidden fascination of a Greek verb ? " he asked quietly . Her cheeks colored . She said , " And I must n't see Evgenia Vasilikaagain , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . " They really have wrapped you up , he thought as he looked at her , " Then find another one . " " You 're in league with George , " she said , trying to be unconcerned , succeeding only in being annoyed . " Then I 'm in good company . He is no fool . " " But he gives no explanation , no reason . I 'm not a child  --  " " Just take a tip from Uncle Ken : do n't be so damned independentall of a sudden . " " Why not ? " " Because this is one time not to throw a rebellion . Who is more important to you ? Yorghis and Vasilika or your husband ? " " Oh , do n't be ridiculous ! " she said , and started gathering her handbag and gloves . " Relax , relax , " he said gently . " If you ca n't tell George about it , tell me . You 've got to tell someone , have n't you ? " " No ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all . " It is just all so silly . Evgenia Vasilika has been kinder to me than anyone else  --  taken more trouble  --  could n't have been more thoughtful . It is difficult to refuse kindness , is n't it ? And now I 've got to tell her we do n't want that fiat , and I ca n't see her again . It 's a horrible position to be in . " He asked , " And has Yorghis been helpful , too ? " She said nothing . " How can you stand that little runt ? He 's on the make . Anything for quick money . What does he spend it on ? Wine , women  --  ? "  | " The race track , " she said . " And do n't be so contemptuous . He was n't always so pathetic . " " Yes , " Strang said , " I bet he has a fine record behind him . " " He had a very good war record , " she said defensively . " Selling paper boots to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with the andartes . In the mountains . He was one of the interpreters for the British there . " " " Oh , " said Strang , " for the British there ? And , of course , he knew your husband . " So that was it : not Greek verbs , but recollections . " You really have that piece of history on the brain , " he told her . " What do you expect to find out ? " She looked at him in surprise and indignation . " I 'll bet my last dollar that little Yorghis never was near your husband . " She was on the defensive at once . " He certainly was ! He knew Yannis . And Sideros . And  --  " " Boy , oh boy ! " he said , looking away from her , shaking his head . " You know what ? " she told him icily . " You are quite impossible . I do n't know why I ever bothered talking to you in the first place . " " You know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams of people flowing over the broad and busy street . " Because you knew Steve , I suppose ? " she asked bitterly . But behind the fine indignation was a lurking shadow . He did n't need to answer that . In any case , his eyes had found something surprising and delightful . He rose , a sudden smile breakingover his face . Caroline looked at him sharply , raised her eyebrows . Then she watched him step forward to meet the dark-haired girl . Tall , slender , good skin , good features , good everything . Clothes simple ; good , too , even if on the understated side . But carrying a camera ; oh , you Americans ! Who was she , anyway ? Caroline drew off a glove , and sipped the sherry . Really magnificent eyes , she admitted as she flickeredher own long eyelashes at the introduction . " Do join us , " she said . " Are you staying in Athens , or just passing through , Miss Hil-lard ? " " Miss Hillard is taking Steve 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caroline looked at Cecilia with unfeigned surprise . " I am impressed . But were n't you quick  --  getting here , I mean . " " Steve resigned last week , " Strang said . " Miss Hillard arrived yes/terday . " He looked at Cecilia critically . " I thought you were going to sleep all day . And what will you have to drink ? " " I 've just had coffee , thank you . " " Did n't you get much sleep ? " he asked anxiously . She looked fine . Rested . Yet she seemed a little strained . " Seven wonderful hours . Complete oblivion . Then I half woke . There was no sleeping after that . Naturally . There was too much happening outside my window . And so I am out , wandering . " She looked at them both , a little uncertainly . " And now I think I 'll wander on . Good-by , Mrs. Ottway . " She rose . " You 're headed in the wrong direction for the Parthenon , " Strang told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back onto her chair . " Just let me pay the check , and I 'll set you straight . " " Yes , " Caroline said , as she slipped her glove back on her elegant little hand , " Kenneth is awfully good at setting other people straight . " She laughed very sweetly , and rose . " I have to clash . You must come to dinner , Miss Hillard , as soon as George and I get set-tled . " " Good luck , " Strang said , rising and offering his hand . Caroline looked at him sharply . " With finding a new apartment . " " Yes , " she said slowly . " First I must find a new apartment . " Her green eyes widened , and now they were looking at him with amusement . " And perhaps a new tutor in Greek ? Oh , really , Kenneth  --  what harm is there in a pathetic little man like Yorghis ? " She looked down at Cecilia and surprised a look of recognition . " Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorghis who used to work for the Spyridon Makres Agency  --  yes . " " Used to work ? " Caroline looked puzzled . " Well , I called them up just half an hour ago . About arrangements for my trip to Nauplion tomorrow . And they told me he had been discharged . " And that , thought Cecilia , saved me a lot of embarrassmentexplaining I did n't want him as an interpreter . " I 've arranged for a woman interpreter , " she told Strang . " But why , " demanded Caroline , " why discharged ? " " I did n't ask . " Caroline looked puzzled , troubled . Perhaps the good name of the Spyridon Makres Agency had been a recommendation for Yorghis . And then , just as Strang was thinking hopefully that this might decidethe question of Yorghis completely , she made one of her **30;2246;TOOLONG turns . " It seems so -- so unjust , " she said . Then she was walking quickly away , her head high , her heels clackingin light indignation . " Yes , " said Strang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Yorghis , who needs his job so badly . " He drained his glass . " Let 's hope that does n't make her rally to his defense . " " Is she like that ? " " A warm heart and a light head . It 's a deadly combination . " " But attractive . " " Half of the time . The other half ? I could throttle her , out of sheer exasperation . " " Oh  --  " That was n't too good , she thought , and felt the little chill of despondency strike her . You had to like someone before you could be exasperated . Because when you were exasperated , you kept thinking about her ( or him ) , worrying about her , hoping you could find what you thought was there ; and so you kept trying and trying . Exasperation might be constant disappointment , but it was also a perpetual challenge . You ought to know , she told herself , rememberingsome of her own inexplicable perseverances . Now if only Ken had used the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irritation meant mosquitoes , bothersome flies , something you smacked down or learned to ignore . " She likes you , " Cecilia said . That was obvious . Strang looked up in surprise from calculating the waiter 's tip . " Yes , " he said without any enthusiasm , " I 'm the fatherly type , it seems . " " Oh ? " " Am I ? " " No . " " Thank you . She has got me almost believing that I am . " " Interesting technique , " Cecilia observed . " Needs lots of advice , and help , and  --  " She paused . Dear dear me , she thought , how could I dislike another woman so quickly ? Strang looked at her . " That 's it . But it 's not technique , exactly . She just ca n't help it . She 's really a sort of complicated simplicity . " No comment , Cecilia , she warned herself . But she could n't resist saying , " She sounds a thoroughly muddled Martini . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , and then grew thoughtful . " If I had n't met Caroline Ottway in a bookshop in Taormina , life would have been simpler for  --  " He broke off , wonderingabout that . Simpler for whom ? Myself , certainly . If Caro/line had n't met me , I would n't have started worrying about Steve , or even remembering his story about the mountains ; I would n't have heard about Sideros , or started wondering about George Ottway'scuriosity in the house opposite his hotel ; I would n't have been up in the Greek theater , late on a Saturday afternoon , trying to meet Katherini Roilos , and , instead , seeing the Medea sail from Messina . In fact , I would n't even have known Katherini was in Taorminaat all if I had n't carried Caroline Ottway 's magazines back to her hotel . That simple stroll had started a chain reaction of curiosity , uncertainty , worry , doubt . And without all that , there would have been a very different first meeting with Alexander Christophorou : he would have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what then ? They would have been stolen before I left Taormina , and Steve would have been murdered right then . No need for any further postponement .. . " Odd , " he said , " to think what might not have happened , what did . But perhaps it was just as well my life was thoroughly complicated . " Except for Katherini Roilos . Would she have been alive today if I had n't been drawn into this whirlpool ? " Sorry , " he said , noticing Cecilia 's still silence . " It is always painfulto try to reshape the past . It should never be done in public . " He thought of Colonel Zafiris , who would n't approve of such indiscretion . " I had a strange kind of morning . I 'm sorry . " He gathered together the papers and magazines and books . He said , much more cheerful , almost back to normal , " Oh , here 's a present ! " He placed the slim edition of the Cavafy poems in front of her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at least he had n't forgotten her completely this morning , even if Caroline Ottway seemed to take more than her fair share of his thoughts . She looked at the book . It 's always the way , she told herself : you meet a man you like , a man you like very very much , and he is already tangledup with someone else . Someone who is so damned obvious that she has got to wear jade earrings .. . " But I thought you would like it , " he was saying anxiously , watching her . " I do . Very much . Thank you . " " Then where 's your smile ? " She looked at him uncertainly . " I bought you that present for completely selfish reasons , " he told her . " I wanted one of those smiles you keep for thank-you occa-sions. "  | " Oh , Ken ! " She smiled , a little embarrassed but mostly delighted . " Much better , " he pronounced . " You 've the prettiest smile I 've ever seen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A smile is a smile  --  " " It is n't . It 's a display of teeth , a show of gums , a simper , a crack , a collection of wrinkles , a sag of double chin . And only now and again , if a man is lucky , he sees a real smile . " And his heart stops for three seconds . Particularly , he thought , when there are eyes to match that smile . She was sitting quite still , holding the book against her breast , her hands folded across its back . " All right , " he said brusquely , " let 's find someplace to eat . " He rose and gathered up her camera on his arm . " And then , we 'll climb up to the Acropolis . That 's what you want to do , is n't it ? " She nodded . " But you must n't change your own plans for me . I mean  --  " She stopped in confusion as she saw the expression in his eyes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will be safe there , " she told him , as they started toward the Grande Bretagne . She held out her hand . " Let me take the camera . It 's a nuisance . " " Then why should you take it ? " She thought about that , with a new surprise . Her insistence faded . " You really have your hands full as it is . " Indeed I have , he thought . How am I going to persuade her to change her plans about Nauplion . ( " Tell her ? " he had asked , doubtfully . " Certainly , " the Colonel had said . ) " Besides , " she was saying , " I am so used to clutching a camera  --  " " Independent , are n't you ? " That silenced her . " You are n't the type , " he told her . " C. L. Hillard has to be . " " C. L. Hillard is strictly for the world of Mr. Lee Preston . " " Lee Preston  --  oh , heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " " To let him know I 'm here and we 've met , and  --  " She began to laugh . " He can stop worrying : everything is completely on schedule , all going according to plan . " That amused Strang , too . " I 'd have taken a bet against that , " he told her . " This is one morning I never expected to end with a real laugh . " She looked at him quickly , her blue eyes grave . " As bad as that ? " " No , no , " he reassured her , covering up his blunder . " Not altogether . Some good news . Things are more under control than Ip270thought . There are a lot of bright boys on this job . That 's the feelingI got , at least . " And there 's some very bad news , too , she thought ; that is why he has been worried and tense . No use pestering him with questions . If he tells me anything at all , he will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Probably , he is going to let me enjoy lunch , have my first visit to the Acropolis in peace , and then he 'll bring up the bad news gently , sideways , trying not to alarm me . Is that the way it is ? She hoped , somehow , it was . For a girl who had spent six years practicing hard to stand on her own two feet , it was surprising how quickly she had been learning to lean on a man 's arm . Careful , she told herself , careful .... The arm is taken away , and then what ? You remember . You 've been through all that , once before . If you are an intelligent , sensible girl , you 'll never risk all that pain again . Never . Once was enough in any lifetime . She glanced at him . But how did you stop yourself from falling in love ? Think of jade earrings . Who cares about even real jade earrings ? All right , think of his faults . You ca n't ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running away ; it has always been the easy solution . " Tomorrow , " she said , looking at the cars being loaded with baggage in front of the hotel entrance , " just about this time , I 'll be leaving for Nauplion . " He looked down at her with a strange expression on his face . " We 'll have to talk about that , " he said . Then they were separated by one of the sponge sellers who seemed to have permanent rights on the sidewalk in front of the hotel . The sponges , strung together , covering him in a cloak of monstrous growths , bobbed and floated as he turned toward them hopefully , only his face and his feet clearly visible at either end of the swaying cocoon . " Not today , " Strang said . " Now , if he ever got caught in a heavy downpour  --  " Cecilia completed the vision in her own mind . Strang 's glance had paused , and hardened , just for a brief second , somewhere behind her . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christophorou . He had n't seen them yet , but he would . Very soon . At his pace , they 'd all meet on the doorstep of the Grande Bretagne . Strang looked at the sponges . " Choose one , " he told Cecilia . " Very good sponges , " the man assured her , sensing a sale , calculatinghow much could be charged . The breeze whisked them up , like a bulbous ruff , around his ears.  | " But I 've no room in my " Pick one out , " Strang said urgently . She glanced at him , asked whether she ought to poke or probe , was it color or size or what ? She examined the nearest one , at least eighteen inches in diameter . " How do you pack such an object when it is wet ? Or perhaps you do n't take a bath on the day you are traveling ? " And how long do I keep talking ? she wondered . And must I really choose one of these objects ? The man decided for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . " Free my right hand , will you ? Thanks . " Strang searched for his wallet . She waited , hugging the slipping load of books and magazines under one arm , holding the sponge in the other , her hair whipped by the breeze from the open square over her eyes , her skirts flaring around her knees . " Help ! " she said faintly , and laughed . " With very great pleasure , " Alexander Christophorou said , comingforward , freeing her arm of the books . " Hullo , Kenneth ! You look as if you had been enjoying your morning . " He glanced at the backs of the books . " The Peloponnese ? Is that where you start ? " " I 've got to get down to work sometime . " The sponge seller was floating away . There was no more excuse for delay . " Are you having luncheon here ? " Christophorou was asking Cecilia . " Then why do n't we all  --  " " Not today , " Strang said . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I 'll take the books . " Cecilia said quickly , " We have to talk over our plans , Mr. Christophorou . I 'm leaving tomorrow for Nauplion , and Ken has to brief me . You know . . . . " Christophorou looked at her for a long moment . " I do n't . But I can imagine why my friend , here , enjoys his work so much . " They began to walk , all three of them , into the hotel lobby , brilliantly lit , filled with sound and movement . " When will you return ? " Christophorouasked Cecilia . " Next week . Probably . " " Then perhaps  --  if I can get you away from your camera or from Kenneth  --  you 'll have dinner with me ? " " Why  --  yes . " " I look forward to that . " Christophorou glanced at KennethStrang . " Good-by . " He shook hands with each of them , most formally . " I shall leave a note for you , " he told Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than necessary . Then he left and went into the bar . " One thing 's for damned sure , " Strang said , very quietly , " we do n't eat here . " He looked at her . " You are n't going to have dinner with him . Are you ? " " What else could I say ? " " You could have said no . " " And made him wonder why ? " " Why should he wonder why ? " " Because he 's a most attractive man . " " You think that ? " Strang stared at her . He was tight-lipped . " He knows that . Ken , " she added , looking at him in dismay , " Iwas only trying to help you out . You looked so  --  so grim . " " I did n't look half as grim as I felt . " He looked at their armloads . " Let 's dump this . And get the hell out . " He started toward the porter'sdesk . " We sha n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He is leaving . " He even gave them a wave of his hand and a self-mockingexplanation . " No rest for a journalist ! " he told them as he passed by . But his eyes , Strang noticed , were n't smiling . " Here is your bath sponge , " Cecilia said . " Not mine . Yours . " " Oh , heavens ! I mean , thank you . What original presents you do choose . . . . Cleanliness is next to poetry ? " " That 's right . Meru sang . . . " I had better leave this where it looks more natural . " She turned toward the elevator , holding the enormous bath sponge nonchalantly , as if she were quite accustomed to wandering around hotel lobbies looking like an absent-minded Aphrodite with a solid piece of foam still clinging to her . " See you in ten minutes ? " " Right . I 'll wait for you in the bar . " He watched the elevator door close behind her . At his elbow , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , eh ? " Strang ignored that , and went into the bar . He had always dislikedpeople who ended sentences with " eh ? " But as he ordered a Scotch and soda , and glanced around the crowd , he admitted his nerve ends were raw . If he could worry in peace , he might be less on edge . All this pretense of everything being quite normal  --  that was what really wore a man down . He was relieved to see no one he knew in the bar . No more pretense , meanwhile . just some plainp273worrying . One thing was certain , the Colonel might murmur " Discretion ! " warningly , but Cecilia would have to be told enough to put her on her guard . " To Nauplion , " she had said so innocently . And Christophorou had looked at her searchingly , perhaps trying to calculate some hidden purpose , a threat or an ill-timed little joke . Then he wondered what signal Christophorou had received in this bar , or piece of information ( a note concealed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't it ? ) which had sent him away so quickly with that grim look in his eyes ? I wish to God , Strang thought , that Colonel Zafiris would pick him up right now , and finish all this waiting . The Colonel had certainly much more information than he told me , and probably much more proof . The Greeks were never simple ; they were like icebergs , one tenth showing , nine tenths hidden . What was the Colonel waiting for ? I know one thing for certain : he does n't wait without some purpose . Oh , blast them all , Strang thought bitterly , why do they make life so com-plicated ? As he drank his Scotch , he looked at the camera lying on the bar before him . Now what could a camera be used for , with its insides ripped out , some of these fancy new explosives expertly stuffed inside , a detonation triggered to the release ? Only Yorghis would n't get very near any dictator to take a pretty picture with a borrowed camera ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with fifty other people , for the sake of The Cause . Besides , preparationshad been long made in Yugoslavia : a camera brought in , at this stage ? Not likely . And why should a camera be borrowed and used if it was going to be blown to pieces ? The serial number , the sure lead to identification , would have to stay intact . A British camera . . . In Yugoslavia ? No . No purpose there . Now a camera traced to a Greek owner  --  that would have had some point . What if that camera never went to Yugoslavia at all ? Yorghis borrowed it , Yorghis handed it over for use elsewhere . Or perhaps I 'm all wrong , he thought , perhaps I 've got conspiracy and plots on the brain . Perhaps Yorghis , for once , acted quite honestly . He wanted a camera to take snapshots of pretty girls in swim suits . Strang looked at Cecilia 's camera . A revolver , he thought , could be used in a camera , and the identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , might have only one chance of hitting its target . Guards were n't supposed to allow more than that . No , he decided again , a revolver is too chancy for the sure thingp274that Drakon has been planning . He would want something with more coverage than one bullet , something more certain and more spectacular . Good God , he thought as he noticed his reflection in the glass behind the bar , what a lot of pretty little speculations you 're churningaround behind that completely calm and normal face ! His face , indeed , was so normal that he was shocked . What our brave-newworldscientists ought to be inventing was a thought ray , revealing everything going on inside the inhuman head . That would take care of a lot of crookery . Honest men might be able to sleep better . A camera , used in an assassination , identifiable as belonging to the wife of an English attache . . . Where would that stir up some really nasty trouble , setting people at one another 's throats ? There was no lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy world . Cyprus was one of them . And Ottway was on his way there , suddenly , unexpectedly , after a session with the Colonel this morning . Now , if I were Drakon , how would I arrange that little operation ? A batch of Greek resistance heroes and Cypriot patriots blown to pieces by a Turk in the pay of the perfidious English . Camera and Turk , of course , intact . You could n't destroy evidence after arrangingit so carefully . But what would you use in the camera ? Or would you just use it as a carrying case , something from which you could extract a high-powered grenade and throw it ? Strang felt cold sweat edge his brow at the idea he had conjured up . No , he decided , I would n't really make a very good Drakon . I have n't a strong-enough stomach . He paid for his drink , looked at his watch . She was two minutes late . He picked up the camera and started toward the door . In his haste he almost ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a late late night , but with a worried glint in his blue eyes . " I was hoping to see Ottway here , " Tommy kept his voice low as he looked around the room . " Tried to speak with him this morning several times . I 'm sorry , Strang . I do n't seem much help to you . I just ca n't get him on the telephone . " " I think we can stop worrying about him . He did n't need any prodding . " " He took action by himself ? " The old eyes were relieved . " We should have expected that , " Tommy said , a little severely . He bowed to a table nearby . " Come and let me introduce you to Madame Kontos . Delightful woman . Widow of a poet . Interested in music . Most knowledgeable . She holds the most absorbing salon every Sundayp275afternoon . You simply must see that side of Athens , my dear fellow . Come along . " " I 'm afraid I ca n't . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you again for last night . I 'm sorry we gave you so much trouble . " " Not at all , not at all . " The genial face was clouded . " It 's a very bad show , a very bad show , indeed . All around . " Tommy hesitated . " I had a very odd visitor this morning . " " Oh ? " Tommy drew Strang to one side of the doorway , maneuvered him against a corner free from traffic , dropped his voice still more . " Askingquestions about Aleco , " he whispered . " About that ring ? " Tommy stared for a moment , perhaps even a little disappointed . " Yes . " " Do you remember it ? " " Never saw it in my life . " Then he studied Strang 's tense face . " Is it so important to you ? " he asked in surprise . " Yes , " Strang said . " And to Miss Hillard . " Tommy was worried now , embarrassed . " There was such a ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from seeing Aleco 's father . That young man who visited me was leaving as I arrived . Aleco 's father  --  well , I have never seen him so distressed . This may kill him , you know . " " He identified the ring ? " " What else could he do ? Tell a lie about it ? " asked Tommy angrily . Strang shook his head . So now I know , he was thinking ; no doubts , small hopes , or explanations left . Alexander Christophorou is Odysseus . Tommy touched his arm . " This goes , of course , no farther ? " " No farther . " And you and I , he was thinking , are now charter members of The Great Deceived . " There must be some explanation , do n't you think ? " Strang nodded . But not the explanation that either of us wanted . " Ah , well  --  " Tommy said , leaving the incomprehensible , turning to the immediate , as he took a step away . " You will remember to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a normal tone of voice , nodded to a passing friend , and moved toward the most knowledgeable Madame Kontos . Strang stepped into the lobby . He was late . But Cecilia was later.  |p276He  looked at his watch again , checked it with the clock . He had a moment of real panic , standing there in the lobby , normal faces and voices all around him , everyone safely assured , with only thoughts of food or drink or pleasant expeditions in their well-groomed heads . But just then , she appeared , coming down the last steps of the staircase that the baggage porters used . " The elevators were packed , " she said . " They kept passing my floor . So at last I gave up , and walked . Am I late ? "  |p277It  was too early , Greek time , for the huge dining room to be busy . So luncheon was fairly quick , with several waiters in full evening dress to serve them lamb chops and coffee . " You 'll need more than that , " Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that drink I had in the bar ruined my appetite . " " Or something . " She looked at him . So he had to smile cheerfully and pretend he could taste the food . " About this Nauplion trip , " he began , tactfully enough , once everything was eaten except the bones in little paper frills . " You 're not really serious about it , are you ? " " Why not ? I have to start work sometime . " " That 's a good idea , " he agreed . " But not Nauplion . Not for a few days , at least . Give your eye time to get accustomed to Greek light , all that sort of thing . " She did n't seem much impressed . " You might as well wait until I can go there with you . " " But I thought you liked to work on your own . You and Steve  --  " " Steve was different , " he told her . " I had worked with him before . We had time to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , he knew mine . We could work alone . See ? " " I see . " But there was a slight curve on a wall-marked eyebrow . " If we could talk over plans , this evening , would n't that be enough ? " " No . " " But  --  " " I do n't want you wandering alone around the Peloponnese , at this time , Cecilia . Have you got that ? Not alone . "  |p278His  face was so set , so serious that she stopped objecting . " Yes , " she said . He took a deep breath of relief . It had been easier than he had expected , after all . " Then , " she asked , " where can I wander around alone ? In Athens ? " " That was the idea , this morning . But now  --  " " Now ? " she wondered . " I 'd like to put you on a flight for Rome , this afternoon . " " Rome ? " Her eyes widened . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course I do , " he said sharply . " I just want you to stay in Rome for a few days . Or Paris . Or London . Anywhere you like  --  " " But Lee Preston  --  what is he going to say ? What is anyone going to say ? " " I do n't give one good damn . " " Ken , " she said softly , " what I mean is this : if I went away from Greece right now , it would seem very strange . Would n't it ? All last night , all this morning , you 've been trying to keep everything looking  --  well , as normal as possible . We are just two visitors , with only their assignment from Perspective to worry about . " He looked at her . She had noticed more than he had imagined . " I am right , you know , " she said gently . " If you send me away , you might as well announce to the whole Grande Bretagne barthat you 've got something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd be safe , at least . " Perhaps , she thought . But he would have doubled his own danger . " Let 's bluff it out , " she said . " Let 's keep any most attractive character from confirming his suspicions , shall we ? " Yes , she had noticed much more than Strang had imagined . " Besides , " she was saying , " how do you know that Rome or Londonwould be any safer ? " He remembered Katherini 's passing reference to her aunt 's journeysabroad . The barbarians , today , had a long reach . " You have a point there , " he admitted . As he signed the check , he was thinking gloomily that the battle of Nauplion might have been won , but he had lost the campaign . She was staying in Greece . He brooded over that as she added a touch of lipstick to her lower lip without distorting her mouth or grimacing , gathered her bag and gloves together , and rose . They started the long walk to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a polite scraping of  |p279forks  , a continuous chorus in five languages or more . " Come to Sparta with me , " he said . " Visit Steve 's sister . " She was completely startled . Then she recovered a little . " That would seem quite normal ? " she teased him . " Completely in line , " he assured her . " I  --  I really do n't know . " She pretended to be interested in atable banked with flowers , where a Greek-American and his family were being given a welcome-back party . Her attention was caughtby two elegant saris , swaying gracefully into the room , two paces behind their Western-suited husbands . " Are n't they divine  --  " shebegan. it " Plenty of wild mountains , " he said , " spring flowers , blue sky , white clouds . What more does a photographer want ? " She said nothing . " Shepherds and their dogs , peasants on donkeys , villages perched away among the crags . And there is Mistra to see , only a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mistra ... " That 's ruined Byzantine , not classical Greek , " she protested . But she was interested . What heaven , she thought , what absolute bliss ! She pulled herself up , sharply . She might not havewanted to run away as far as Rome , but she had better run farther than Sparta . They passed through the crowded anteroom , into the crowded lobby . Strang glanced sharply back again at a neat little man , partly obscured by a group of Frenchmen . But the little man , in the unobtrusive , dark suit , had disappeared entirely . For a moment , there , Strang had imagined he was Elias . But Colonel Zafiris would hardly send Elias to watch over us , he decided . Elias had more important work to do than that . At least , he thought , I hope so . " Yes ? " asked Cecilia . " Nothing , " he said . " Let 's pick up our mail and then get a cab . " She had a cable from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sealed envelope . She had time to notice he had two letters , both with American stamps , both addressed in blatantly female writing . More jade earrings ? Strang stuck the letters into his pocket and helped her into the cab . He glanced around before he followed her ; no , he could n't see Elias looking into any shopwindow or dodging quickly into a doorway.  |p280Cecilia  looked back at the sidewalk , between the pleated silk curtainsdraped across the rear window . " The sponge sellers have gone , " she said . She touched the curtains ' bobbed fringe . Was this really a cab ? Two-tone Plymouths , at home , were never like this : lace mats for heads and arms , a rug on the floor , a pink paper rose in a little vase fastened above the dashboard , three small framed photographs of wife and child , a three-inch doll dangling above them . Let 's hope our man can drive , she thought , what with all these curtains and swaying charms and polite head turnings to talk to Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner'sattempt to speak his language . But she relaxed a little as she saw the man could drive , even at high speed with his profile presented to the street ahead . She opened the cable . It was brief : DID YOU ARRIVE ? LEE PRESTON . The letter was from Robert Pringle 's wife , first name either Affie or Iffie or Effie , suggesting they all drive out to Sunium for dinner next Wednesday . Nice , she thought regretfully , but dinner parties and work do n't always mix . Perhaps the Pringles would give her a rain check on Wednesday . Now for the note . . . It was from Katherini . She read it with relief and delight . " It 's from  --  " she began , and then looked at the driver ( now telling Ken about the new cement works down toward the Piraeus , which were well worth seeing ) , and slipped the note into her handbag . That news would be better kept for the Acropolis . Strang finished explaining , regretfully , that they would have to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also Eleusis , also Marathon . Today  --  yes , all afternoon  --  would be spent at the Acropolis . Then he sat back , exhausted with his battle , and returned thankfully to English . " From whom ? " Cecilia handed him the cable . One glance and , " Very poignant , " he observed . " Tell him we 've been busy . " " We ought to cable , though . " " And what do we tell him about Steve ? " " Yes , there 's that , " she said , frowning . " Especially as Preston is probably reading about his death right now . He 'll be on the telephone to us , any hour . Perhaps we better not answer any long-distance calls for the next few days . Not until we can tell him something definite . " " He 's going to start fretting . "  | " When you have got to tell a lie , keep silent . " Strang crumpled up the cable and tossed it out of the window . " Oh !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be able to talk to Uncle Preston without any faking . " " Soon ? " she asked hopefully . " We 'll have definite news soon , " he said . One way or another , he thought angrily . " I could use some good news , right now . " She looked down at her handbag and hesitated . Then she could n't keep the secret any longer . She took Katherini 's note out of her handbag . " Here is one good piece of news to go on with . " Delightedly , she watched the astonishment that flickered over his face . She looked out of the window while he read the note . The shops and business houses were barred and locked . The streets were strangely quiet . Even the tables in the coffee shops were almost empty , except for a few die-hard philosophers . " What has happened ? Everything has shut down . " Strang looked up from the note , abstractedly . For once , he was slow to catch her meaning . " Until four o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the note . Suddenly , he reached out and grasped her hand . He stared out of the window , seeing nothing . Cecilia watched him , anxiously . Perhaps he did n't like the idea of her going to meet Katherini alone , this evening . But it was to be such a simple , quick meeting at the corner of Constitution Square . What could be more open ? Or easier ? It was only a few steps from the hotel . And all Katherini needed was a little help  --  money for the bus fare back to her village : two single tickets , one for Maria , one for herself . That was all . Strang 's grip on her hand tightened . He was seeing a busy corner , filled with the movement of people at the end of a work day . Darknessfalling . Everyone hurrying home . Cecilia arriving at half past seven . A cab starting forward from the hotel rank , stopping beside her . A door opening , and a woman 's friendly voice calling , " Here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for so many cabs looked like private cars in Athens ) ; the woman 's hand grasping hers , the voice saying urgently , " I am Maria . It was not safe for Katherini to come . Let us drive around this block , while I tell you what has happened . There is much news to give you . " That was all that was needed . That was all . Cecilia was saying , " Ken ! " He released her hand . He folded the note . " Do you mind if I  |p282kee|p  this ? " He hoped he sounded casual enough . But she still looked puzzled . So he adopted a jocular kind of tone . " One thing is definite , my girl . No Athens for you . Not alone . Not for the next few days . You 're coming with me . " " You 're worrying too much . " She sounded fretful , she knew , but she could n't help that . " You still wo n't think of Rome ? " She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So are you . " " Yes , " he said slowly , " I guess I am . " He slipped the note into his pocket . The cab made the last twist and turn in the road and drew up at an open stretch of high ground , well-paved , landscaped with trees and shrubs , lying at the foot of a broad , steep slope of hard-packed earth and outcropping rock . Above the slope , the rock began to dominate and then , abruptly , flowed upward into a precipice , a vast encircling arm thrown around the high island of the Acropolis . The giant columns , rising from the rampart of precipices with a grace that turned solid stone into delicate movement , caught the sun 's warmth and glowed , a golden white , above the cold gray rock . Everything flowed up , carrying man 's eye from earth to heaven . " I 'll wait for you , " the cabdriver told them , breaking the spell . He pointed to a parking space near some young trees and a booth where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were some tourists , some loiterers  --  other drivers , guides , the eternalpost-card sellers . Strang said , " It will be a long wait . " Two hours , at least . Another cab was driving up now . But no one got out . That 's odd , Strang thought . " I 'll wait , " their driver said . He knew best . He flashed a bright Greek smile , white teeth against olive skin . I doubt that , thought Strang . I must have overtipped again . He took Cecilia 's arm and started back toward the other cab . " This way , this way ! " his own driver called quickly , and pointed up to a wandering path which led to the admission gate . Strang turned and retraced his steps . " Stupid of me , " he said . But he had had a glimpse of the man who sat in the back of the other cab . If it had been Christophorou , he thought , I 'd have smashedp283his bloody jaw right here and now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chances , seemingly . Cecilia said quietly , " The man in that cab  --  I saw him , back at the Grande Bretagne . He took the cab after ours . Is he following us ? " " You 'd break his heart if he could hear you . " " You are n't worried ? " " Not this time . " In fact , it was pleasant to feel he could relax a little and leave it all to the experts . " He is one of the Colonel 's young men . " " Are we as important as that ? " " I hope not . " Then he drew her around to face the Acropolis . " Let 's begin again . Forget everything else . " And forget that I just had the desire to smash the face of the man who once brought me here . Oh , forget all that , forget it ! He took a deep breath . They began to climb a dusty path toward a wire fence and an admission gate . " Forget this part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists , and the guards , and the guides . Once we 're through here  --  " He was right . Once they were through , still following the path , they reached the end of the new , the beginning of the old . In front of them lay a series of giant steps , climbing steeply in a double staircase , up to the massive colonnade of the ancient gateway . By its side , high on its own precipice , was the Temple of the Wingless Victory , the first to be seen , always to be remembered . It was the perfect site . Everyone who approached had to look up ; everyone who climbed had to walk slowly ; everyone waited for the moment of seeing what lay beyond . The whole Acropolis opened up to their eyes , a high plateau of solid rock , a vast bare sweep of sloping gray stone , uneven yet worn smooth . Once , there had been many statues and altars and sanctuaries , a multitude of offerings and memorials , a forest of marble richly decorated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rejectedfragments lying scattered around , a pathetic remembrance of things past , there were only the remains of three temples left standing  --  with their rows of fluted columns rising , heavy drum on heavy drum of marble , the gold and sculpture and treasures looted , the dark-red and blue painted decorations washed and faded into whiteness . The houses of the gods , the Greeks had called them . They had been placed in no symmetrical design , but in a seeminglythoughtless imbalance . Thoughtless ? It was powerfully effective , even now in this bare stretch of looted ground , spreadingp284the temples apart , each to the edge of its own precipice , each to be studied by itself , each so different in size and arrangement , each with its own effect . The Parthenon , the largest temple , had been raised not in the middle of the Acropolis , as a methodical mind would have placed it , but to one side , on the highest slope of rockcoveredground . The rows of enormous marble columns seemed straight perfection , yet again there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add grace to solid strength . Strang had become completely absorbed . Cecilia could watch him now without even risking the embarrassment of being noticed . At this moment , she thought , here is a completely happy man . Then she looked out over the precipices ; down at the patchwork of houses , seamed by twisting streets , spreading over the little hills belowher , scattering even around the larger hills farther away . To the southwest was the sea , shimmering in the afternoon sun around its dark islands . But this is an island , too . An island in the sky , she thought , looking back around the Acropolis , stripped of all its riches down to the essentials  --  the mysticism that had first built it , the vision of greatness . She opened her bag and drew out her case of filters and her light meter . Plenty of everyday problems , though , before she could start her imaginings . These widely scattered temples , for instance . The only way to get them grouped together for the exact camera eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south , a hill with green trees and a monument on the top . Here , on the Acropolis , I 'll have to work with each unit complete in itself . I 'll have to find the best angles for each building , the best time of day ; try to give a feeling of height , of soaring . . . . There 's plenty of drama , strong light and deep shade ; plenty of texture , variation in color from the cold gray rock to the blended whites and golden tones of the columns ; plenty of wonderful , marvelous , magnificent lines . The canopy of blue sky was enormous , intense in color , smooth as silk . She would have to be careful of this clear air and bright sun , of the reflected light from the pillars . Very careful , too , of the human beings , moving so capriciously around , their heads tilted back , their eyes swung upward . Tourists , bless their poor tired feet , seldom looked natural . Or elegant . It was a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore back home in their own cities . " We are going traveling , " people said , and started thinking of vacations , pushing lederhosen and shorts and sandals and beach skirts into their suitcases , as if cities abroad were places for picnics orp285hikes or barbecues . The Greeks , on their home ground , dressed in everyday clothes , looked real , and , strangely enough , more comfortable . If she had to have some figures in the foreground , let them be the quiet , brooding Greeks , sitting still , self-contained within their own individual islands . Strang sat on the top step of the western end of the Parthenon , and watched her moving slowly away , circling around , standing in reflection , moving on again . For one moment , he thought she was drifting too far out of sight , and rose . Then he noticed a man , farther clown the slope , rise quietly from his seat on a broken fragment of pediment  --  Elias it was  --  and follow quietly , not at all obviously . So many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuver seemed absolutely natural . Strang relaxed , sat back on the step . At least , he thought , as he looked out once more over the Acropolis , I have had almost an hour of complete forgetfulness . And he was grateful . It was with a new decision , the bright sun pouring its warm energy over him generously , the cool spring breeze fanning away his exhaustion , that he reached in his pocket and took out the letter signed " Katherini . " He rose as he saw Cecilia emerging from behind a corner of the Erechtheum portico . Quickly , he walked down the slope toward her , taking out a cigarette . Elias , he hoped , would not be far away , and this would be the closest Strang could get to him , this afternoon . " Hello , " he said to Cecilia , " how is it coming ? " " Only playing around , feeling my way , testing the film , mostly . The light is too yellow at this time of day , I think . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned toward the man who had wandered into sight and was now standing quite still at the corner of the portico , admiring the procession of maidens , marble carved magically into girls ' strong bodies covered by a transparent flow of silk . " May I borrow a match ? " he asked Elias politely . It did n't take long . Within a minute , he was back with Cecilia , lighting a cigarette for her with his . " Let 's go and look at the olive tree , " he said . " Do you know its story ? " He led her to the other side of the portico , to a stretch of sunken ground guarded by a broken wall . " What did you give him ? " she asked softly . " Was it noticeable ? " " Not at all . But why else did you go up to him ? Oh , do n't worry ,  |p286Ken   --  no one else knew that your lighter was working , and that I had matches . " He studied her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why ? " " It 's a fake . " She looked at him , instantly on the alert . " Let 's sit here and talk , " he suggested . It was a sunny , sheltered spot , both from the vagrant breeze and the wandering tourists . The olive tree , even one that stood on the spot where an olive tree had grown long before the Parthenon was built , and had survived as a symbol of hope when everything else on the ancient Acropolis had been destroyed by the Persians , could not compete on home movies with the Portico of Maidens or the Parthenon itself . A visitor , now , looked over the wall curiously ( tourists always hopefully believed that others might lead them to a good thing ) and called disappointedlyto his friends , " There 's only an old tree ! " And then he was gone . A guard looked over , too , and seemed content that no damage was being done . Elias was walking slowly back toward the main gateway . They were alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild flowers around them , the gnarled olive tree outlinedagainst Pentelic marble . Cecilia sat on a fragment of pedestal , Strang on a broken pillar . " Give me the bad news first , " Cecilia said . Then , as he hesitated , she added , " That way , I know that there is nothing worse to come . " " All right , " he said . " I gave that letter to Elias so that he could get it to Colonel Zafiris , right away . So the woman , or whoever is going to meet you this evening , can be arrested . It wo n't be Katheriniwho is going to keep that appointment . She is dead . " Cecilia said nothing . Her face had whitened , grown expressionless . She sat very still . She could have been carved out of marble , like the maidens high behind her . He told her what the Colonel had described to him . " That is the bad news , " he said . His voice was bitter as he added , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am to blame . I told Christophorou  --  " He stopped speaking . " What was the rest of the news ? " she asked quickly . " What else had the Colonel to say ? " They were both silent for a little when he had ended . Then he came back to Katherini 's death again . " I wondered at the time why the Colonel told me so much . Now , of course , I begin to see . Therep287was a reason behind everything he said , everything he showed me : the fact , for instance , that Katherini vas being questioned when his men entered the Kriton Street house . That was his way of warningme that they might have got some information out of her about you and me . They did , obviously . " He paused . " If I had used my brains , I would have expected something like that letter . " He fell silent again , wondering what else he had missed in that morning'sinterview . Cecilia broke her long silence . She pushed back her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her fingers . " No , " she said , as if she had decided something , " they did n't learn much from Katherini . She would n't tell  --  " " Look , Cecilia , they were questioning her , " he said , his voice harshening . " Do I have to go into details ? " " She would n't break . Not so soon , not so quickly . She had strength , that girl . " " I know that . But even the bravest  --  " He did n't finish . " Yes , I know , " she said . " I 've heard about such things . " She frowned , fighting back her emotion . " But Katherini  --  she would n't tell them anything that would hurt us . I 'm sure of that , somehow . She  --  " Cecilia bent her head to hide her tears . She stirred a fragment of marble with her foot . " We can still bluff them , " she said determinedly . " They still do n't know , exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked around her , then , thinkingthat perhaps she never would have seen the Acropolis at all . But Ken is the one who may really be in danger . Why do they want to get hold of me ? " I told you too much , " he said suddenly . " I wish to God you knew nothing  --  nothing at all . " She began removing the filter from her camera lens , and placed it in the neat little leather pocket in her case . " I 'm thankful you did , " she said calmly . " Ignorance is too dangerous . If the Colonel had n't told you about Katherini , we would really have been in trouble . " She shut the case into her handbag , closed her camera carefully . " Thank God , " he said , watching her , " you do n't panic easily . " You 're a better actress than you thought , she told herself . He helped her to rise . Nearly everyone else had left . In the far distance were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began walking slowly toward the gateway . A vast bare silencelay around them , the deep-blue canopy stretched overhead.  |p288The  western sun was stretching the shadows of the ancient gateway toward their feet . Strang paused and looked back at the Parthenon . The warm rays set it glowing gently , high on its gray slope of rock , as if a fire had been kindled inside it . Cecilia had turned to watch it , too . Her lips were parted a little , in the beginning of a surprisedlook of complete delight ; her eyes were as blue as the sky , as radiant as the sun . " There 's something I want to tell you , " Strang said . She looked around at him . Then her eyes widened anxiously . She had never seen him look so worried , so tense . " I 'm in love with you . " He caught her hands . " Will you marry me ? " For a moment , she stood very still . She could say nothing . She tried to speak . She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " you ca n't say no . It has got to be yes . It has got to be . " " Yes , " she said slowly . His arms went around her , bringing her close . He kissed her . At last , he let her go . And now , as he looked at her , he could say nothing at all . He picked up the handbag and camera , which had dropped at her feet , and then they started toward the gateway . They passed through its chill shadows and came to meet the sun again at the top of the giant steps . " Why did you say no ? " he asked . That had been a bad moment , a moment of loss , complete loss : everything thrown away on a wild impulse . " I did n't say no . " " You shook your head . " " That was sheer wonder . ' This ca n't be me , ' I was saying , this ca n't be me . ' " And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was goingto run farther away than Sparta . " It is you , and it is me , and that is all there is to it . " " But it 's madness . " She was smiling , though . " Ken  --  we are both mad . " " Then this is the kind of madness that keeps men sane . " " But you do n't know me . We do n't  --  " " Do n't we ? " He kissed her again . She did n't argue any more about that . They started down the high steps , Strang leading , her hand on his wrist to steady her . " Back to earth , " he was saying , descending carefully . He was n't too steady himself . He could blame it on thep289dazzling light , on the steep pitch of the staircase , except neither glare nor height had ever made him feel like this before . " Take it easy , " he told her , and tried to follow his own advice . He caught her by the waist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 - he two guards up at the high gateway had come forward to the edge of the portico , and were looking down with quiet interest . " We 'll disappoint them , this time , " he told her , and they began walking to the small office at the admission gate in the high wire fence . Cecilia glanced back , up at the portico . " You do choose your moments , " she said softly . " Not that moment . It chose me . " And that was the unexplainable truth . He had been going to wait , had he , until this trouble was over and their job for Perspective finished ? Yes , that was the way it seemed best , last night . " I may have rushed things a bit , " he admitted , " but I suddenly realized I had wasted enough time in my life . " He glanced at her , to see if a shadow had crossed her face . He could be jealous of even the ghost of a memory . And that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shadow , no ghost . She was looking at him , as if she had guessed his emotion . " At least , " she said slowly , carefully , " we did meet before we wasted any more years . " Then she looked at him with horror , " Oh Ken , we might never have met ! " And Elias , waiting impatiently in the doorway of the small office beside the admission gate , shook his head . The two guards beside the gate had been following the Americans ' slow progress with sympatheticinterest , but Elias , brisk from the quick telephone call he had made , could only think of all the unnecessary delay , the complications , the added danger . How strange were American reactions to a threatening note ! Romantic love was one Western inventionthat Greece could leave well alone . Strang halted as he saw Elias . " Back to earth we are , " he said quietly . " Have a look at the post cards , Cecilia . See what competitionyou have got . " As she went forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated guidebook from the counter at the ticket window . Elias said , " Six o'clock in Miss Hillard 's room . Six o'clock . " " In Miss Hillard 's room ? " That puzzled Strang . " It is easier . " Elias turned away as if to say , " Now stop asking idiotic questions and get back to the hotel as I told you . "  |p290Strang  put down the price of the guidebook , and joined Cecilia . " Found anything ? " " Not yet . " " Another time , then . Come on . " He took her arm and led her through the gate . She saw something had nettled him . " What 's wrong ? " " Nothing . We are just being sent back to your room , that 's all . " He glanced at his watch and his lips tightened . " They do n't give us much time , these boys . " Not much time alone , either , he thought angrily . " But why in my room ? " " I asked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom ? " They 're probably trying to help us , " Cecilia said . " Probably , " he agreed , to please her . But he was still annoyed . He never had enjoyed the feeling that his life was being arranged for him . Then two small boys , near one of the ash-tray-and-bogus-vase booths , saw them coming and ran to wake up a taxi driver sleeping peacefully in his cab . The man stretched and yawned happily . " It was good I waited ? " their driver asked . " Is very beautiful the Parthenon . " And all the energy , gathered in his two-hour sleep , poured into a long discussion of the Acropolis : the foreigners all admired it ; but rich and powerful as foreigners were , had they ever been able to produce anything like that ? No , agreed Strang , and tactfully did n't suggest that no one in Greece in the last two thousand years had ever equaled it , either . Instead , he put forward the idea that now he had better translate all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a reasonable request and was politely granted . So Strang returned to Cecilia for the remaining six minutes of the ride . " When are we getting married ? " he asked . She looked startled . " But we 've just got engaged . " She began to laugh . " Right on top of the Acropolis . . . And we 'd have been married there , too , if it could have beenmanaged , he thought . " You did n't answer the question . " " Well  --  there 's the Perspective job to finish . Is n't there ? " " Yes . But it wo n't get finished if you do n't marry me . " " But would n't that be  --  " " No , it would n't . " " But , darling  --  "  | " It 's quite simple , " he told her . " I can do this job in two ways . Either without you or with you . There 's no half-and-half business possible . First , you 're too beautiful . Second , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely . So that 's the choice , and there is none , because I 'm not doing this job without you . " " And to think , " she said , " I imagined you proposed to me because of the brilliance of my intellect . " She smiled , one of her warmest and truest smiles . She reached toward his cheek and kissed it gently . The hotel lobby was more than usually crowded . " There is a receptionin the ballroom , " the porter told them with lowered voice . The flowered hats were out in full bloom , the green-khaki uniforms showed their medals , young diplomats concealed light thoughts underdark suits , older men stooped under their load of boredom . " Big guns , " Strang said to Cecilia , as he recognized two faces from newspaper photographs . " No place for light artillery . " He hurried her into the elevator , glancing at his watch . It was quarter of six . He took her to her room door . " I 'll be back here in eight minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-by . Love in snatches , he thought wryly , as he hurried upstairs to his room . As he washed at lightning speed , changed his shoes and shirt and tie , he remembered the long lonely hours he had had to himself in Taormina . But that was only to be expected : the minute you got your girl , everything started conspiring to separate you . He was startled to see , in the bathroom mirror , what a cheerful face he was wearing . Love , he decided , made all men look like idiots . His grin widened . All right , he told himself , it feels wonderful , but sober up , for God 's sake , or you 'll blast off into orbit and stay there . He prepared to leave , checking his wallet , fresh handkerchief , keys , giving a last look at his sketchbook abandoned on his desk . " Just wait , " he told it , " 1 ' 11 add drawings to your collection that you wo n't be ashamed of . I 'll do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as he opened his door , with thirty seconds to get down to the second floor , the telephone rang . " Damn ! " he said , started to close the door , hesitated , opened it again . He went back and picked up the receiver . The call was from Sparta . " Waiting , " he said , ready for Petros 's voice . There was a good deal of crackling and fizzing , and at last a woman 's voice asking " Mr. Strang ? " " Waiting , " he said again.  | " Myrrha Kladas , " the voice said , and came in a little more clearly now . " I am Myrrha Kladas . The sister of Steve . " Strang strained to catch the distant , hesitant voice . " More slowly , please , " he told her . Greek was difficult enough without a long-distance call to add to his troubles . " Steve 's sister , " she repeated . " Do you understand ? " " Yes , yes . " " Please come . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is urgent . " The voice had strengthened . " But where ? " " I must see you . " " Where ? " " Near Thalos there is a bridge , a path that leads to my house , one kilometer past the village . I shall wait there . " " Tomorrow ? About noon ? " If he left at six in the morning , that ought to let him reach Thalos by that time . " Tonight , " she said . " But it is almost six o'clock now . " " I shall wait . " " I can not leave until seven . " Seven at the very earliest , he thought , and even that would be difficult . " I shall wait , " Myrrha Kladas said , her sad voice fading again , and , this time , into silence.  |p293Strang  took only thirty seconds to get down , by staircase , to Cecilia 's door . She opened it , a little subdued . " I 'm late , you should keep this door locked , sorry darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one quickly gathered breath as he put his arms around her and kissed her . Then he saw that there were others there . Damnation , he thought , and closed the door and turned to face them all . Pringle , in subdued and diplomatic gray , seemed a little startled . Elias , an eyebrow raised , looked at his watch . ColonelZafiris , resplendent in full decorations , appeared to notice nothing at all . He shook Strang 's hand politely , offered Cecilia a chair with a gracious wave of his hand , selected the pink-velvet sofa for himself , and lit a cigarette . " I have ten minutes , " the Colonel said . He allowed himself a slight gleam of a smile . " Unless , of course , Mr. Strang receives other telephone calls . " It might have been a neat reminder that Strang had n't yet apologizedto anyone except Cecilia ; or it could have been subtle curiosity . I 'll take it as curiosity , thought Strang . " It was a call from Sparta , " he said bluntly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Steve 's sister , Myrrha Kladas . " That got everyone 's attention . Elias even stopped looking at his watch . " Sparta  --  " the Colonel said softly . " By that , do you mean the town of Sparta itself ? " " I assumed it was from Thalos . " " There is no telephone in Thalos . " The Colonel looked at Elias , who burst into a rush of suggestions . Elias seemingly knew thep294situation at Thalos . And it was his feeling that the call , for the sake of privacy , would be made from the town of Sparta itself . " If it was a very private call , " the Colonel agreed with him . And then to Strang , " Was it ? " " Yes . She said it was urgent . Wants me to leave at once . She said she would be waiting at a bridge , one kilometer past the village . " He frowned . " One odd thing , though . She was talking in Greek , but she identified herself as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she use Steve ? " That was still puzzling him . The Colonel exchanged a brief glance with Elias , and then studied the half-inch of firm white ash on the end of his cigarette . He shrugged his shoulders for an answer . Then he said , " Are you going to Thalos ? " " Yes , " Strang said . He looked over at Cecilia reassuringly . " It wo n't take long , " he told her . Cecilia tried to smile , but the worry in her eyes kept growing . The Colonel nodded . " It would be a pity , " he said , " to miss this opportunity of finding out the reason why she telephoned you . She was not very communicative yesterday morning when Elias visited her with the news we had just received of her brother 's death . " Cecilia drew a deep breath . It was all very well for the Colonel to take such a cold , objective interest ; he was n't going to keep any midnight appointment on a lonely mountain road . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said softly , " may I go with you ? As you had planned ? " If I 'm with him , she thought , he will take fewer chances . But she knew from his face what he had decided for her : it was that plane for Rome , with Pringle seeing her safely on board . The Colonel , even if he had seemed to pay her little attention since the first moment of politeness , said , " Quite impossible , Miss Hillard . But do n't worry . Mr. Strang will not be traveling alone . " He signed to Elias . " Tell Spyridon Makres that Mr. Strang needs that car right away . Seven o'clock punctually at the hotel entrance . Make sure they send you a Cadillac or a Chrysler  --  " He noticed the amused flicker on Strang 's face . " It is not a matter of snobbery , " he told Strang ; " it is a matter of horsepower and of weight . Our mountain roads are more easily managed in a car that will hold the curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment  --  " one hundred and sixty miles to Sparta from here . With a powerful car , and a driver who knows each turn on the road , you will not keep Myrrha Kladas waiting much past midnight . " He nodded to Elias.  | " Miss Hillard may possibly not object to having your instructions telephoned from her bedroom . You would permit him , Miss Hillard ? Thank you . Make all arrangements , Elias . " Elias moved into the next room and closed its door quietly but firmly behind him . " Now , " the Colonel said , shaking off the full inch of ash from his cigarette , rising , " there seems little time left to discuss what I came here to arrange . But , after Mr. Strang 's news , I 'm afraid no discussion is possible . We shall just have to accept Mr. Pringle 's idea of how to keep Miss Hillard safe . " Strang said quietly , " I hope it coincides with mine . When is the first plane to Rome ? Bob , will you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you know that will only double your own danger to send me out of Greece . I told you before , I just wo n't  --  " She halted , and turned away . The Colonel looked surprised , and then relieved . " Miss Hillard is right , " he said , and put out his half-finished cigarette . " One must never admit to the enemy that one is vulnerable . Or he will strike where he thinks he really has found a weakness . " Strang said , " He knows where I 'm vulnerable . " " Are you sure ? That note to Miss Hillard could have been a test , a probing action , to find out whether she did know the name of Katherini . " Strang looked angrily at Colonel Zafiris . Then he knew that the Colonel had thought of several other things , too . The mass kidnapingof children , the taking of hostages , these were a part of history that the Colonel was n't likely to forget . But one must never admit one 's worst fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Miss Hillard safe , " the Colonel promised him . He turned to say good-by to Cecilia . " Just one more day , " he told her gently . " It is n't too much to ask of you ? One day of patience , of great caution . And by tomorrow night , so much will be explained to our enemy in three little newspaper paragraphs that I think he will have no other alternative but to eliminate himself . " He took her hand and bowed over it . " Entirely , " he added very softly . He gave Strang a very firm handshake . " Your driver will be Costas . Elias will be your interpreter . " And then , as he foresaw an objection to that , " No , no ! I can not let you go alone . Not while I still have two questions unanswered : who made that telephone call ; and if it was Myrrha Kladas , then who paid for it ? She has so little money , so little of anything  --  " He clapped Strang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , " I 'll see you downstairs , Pringle . We must not disappoint Mr. Christophorou , must we ? " He gave a quick glance into the corridor . All must have been well . The door closed behind him . " Did you hear that ? " Pringle asked worriedly . " He 's going to the reception . " " Because Christophorou will be there , " Pringle said , shaking his head . " A war of attrition , seemingly . " But who paid for the telephone call ? The Colonel had made a good point : such telephone calls cost money . " It just does n't seem possible , " Pringle said . " Christophorou -- I mean . The Colonel 's really tying him up with Drakon ? But that 's fantastic ! " " The hell with Drakon . What 's your bright idea ? " Pringle , still excited by the feeling that he was standing on the verge of something really important , looked blankly at Strang . " About Cecilia , " Strang said . " And it had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , it 's quite simple , " Pringle said modestly . " Miss Hillard stays at our apartment until the alarm is over . Effie will keep her company , there , all tomorrow . The Colonel will have a couple of watchdogs outside . " He grinned . " And if that is n't enough to please you , I 'll get a handsome young marine to come and play pinochle with the ladies . " " Very funny , very funny , " Strang said grimly . " So that takes care of Thursday . " " And then you 'll be back here . " " And if I 'm delayed ? " " Then we 'll keep Miss Hillard . Effie will take her around , show the enemy she has friends . Part of this vulnerable doctrine the Colonel was talking about is simply that you are both strangers in Athens . " Strang looked at Cecilia . " Well ? " he asked . Her eyes met his . Slowly , she said , " I 'll see you tomorrow night . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw a toothbrush into your overnight case . I 'll go downstairs and fraternize . I 'll tell Effie it 's all set . I 'll come back here just before seven , and smuggle you out . Right ? " " Pack now , " Strang said to Cecilia.  | " But Elias is still telephoning . " She crossed over to the bedroom door and knocked . " That turned to Pringle , who was just leaving , and lowered his voice . " Bob  --  there 's something else . Do you know anything about marriage licenses or regulations in this part of the world ? " " Oh , I think the families still try to arrange it , and there 's a dowry , and a six-month engagement , or a year , something like that . " " For foreigners , you dope . For us . " Pringle 's merriment faded . " Are you serious ? " He looked at Strang . " By God , you are ! Well , well  --  " He shook Strang 's hand warmly . " Full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the regulations . Get the routine straight . " Nowadays , everything , everywhere , had to be signed in triple quintuplate . " Be glad to . That 's one good piece of news today . " He was still a little bewildered but honestly delighted . Nothing seemed to please a married man more than to see a holdout bachelor joining him , " Do n't spread it around , meanwhile . " " No , " agreed Pringle thoughtfully . " No . Not yet . " More briskly , he added , " Cheer up , Ken . Another day to wait before the ax falls . That 's all . And we can all stop worrying about being vulnerable . " And you are the worst off , of us all , he thought , and looked away . " I hear Ottway has gone chasing off to Cyprus . " Strang stiffened . " I meant to tell the Colonel  --  Bob , you 'd betterdo it , and fast . Yorghis is heading for Yugoslavia . " " Now , now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early this morning , just as he was leaving to pick up two journalists at their hotel . " " Did he talk ? " " Certainly . There 's a big difference between being arrested forusing his firm 's car on false pretenses and being considered part ofa lethal conspiracy . So he is clearing himself by telling as much ashe knows . The people who hired him to drive them to Athens fromNauplion were Cypriots , he said , and he only thought he was beinga patriot in helping them . Most disarming . But he did one usefulthing , without knowing it . He directed our attention to Cyprus.  |p298There  's a celebration there tomorrow , you know : general rejoicing over independence , next year . " " And did he have any camera , when he was arrested ? " Pringle looked at him curiously . " Camera ? " " The one he borrowed from Caroline Ottway to take to Yugo-slavia . " Pringle 's bland look had gone . " Who told you that ? " " Caroline Ottway . " " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dazed moment vanished . " I 'll see the Colonel , " he said , exchanged a grim look with Strang , and left . Cecilia heard the door close behind Pringle , and she came back into the pink sitting room . Strang swung around to face her . " Packed and ready ? " he asked her . She nodded . There was so much to say , so little time . " I still wish I could come with you  --  " " No , " he said gently , " no . " He held out his arms , and she went into them , and they stood there , holding each other , his cheek against her hair . " Later , we 'll go to Sparta . Properly . We 'll see it together . No one to  --  " he looked up with annoyance to see Elias at the bedroom door , and his voice sharpened  --  " keep butting in . " In spite of herself , she laughed . She drew away . " Everything arranged ? " asked Strang crisply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need a coat . In Sparta , a sudden freshening is to be feared . " He looked at them , wondered why their faces had turned so strangely expressionless . He hesitated . He must go downstairs , for there would be some last instructions to be receivedfrom the Colonel ; there always were . But they might think him impolite to leave them like this . He took a step toward the door , glanced quietly at his watch . Time was running out . " Lock the door , " he told them . " Much safer . Yes ? " " Yes , " said Strang . Elias heard the key turn in the lock , and there was laughter , too . They probably thought such a precaution was stupid , btkt they were so careless of everything when they were together . Separate , the American was alert , a capable man , no fool  --  Elias had watched him this morning , most carefully ; and the young lady was not one of those hysterical , nonsensical creatures  --  he had watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cameras in/side her largest suitcase , choosing a small one to take with her , packing neatly , decisively . But when they got together , they noticednothing , their minds had left them , anything could happen . Westerners , he decided , were totally incomprehensible . Or perhaps the truth was that they were all a little crazy , living as they did in a child 's world of indulgence and pleasure , out of touch with reality . Did they really believe that life owed them happiness ? Pringle was the first to return . He knocked gently , waited , knocked again , said , " It 's Pringle " in an angry whisper . Strang let him in . " You 're early . " Pringle 's annoyance melted . " Is Miss Hillard ready ? " " Just about . " " Sorry to burst in like this . But we could n't have a better chance to slip away . Caroline Ottway came to the reception . Guess who backed her into a nice corner of palm trees ? " Strang , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Christophorou . They 're having a very pleasant chat . " " Good God ! " Strang said slowly . " Exactly , " said Pringle . " My sentiments exactly . As for the Colonel 's ! I had a moment with him , by the way . Yorghis had no camerawhen he was arrested . Must have already passed it over to his friends . He will have a good deal of explaining to  --  " He turned as he heard Cecilia 's light footsteps . For a moment , he stood looking at her . Every now and again , he was thinking , you see beauty like this , and it is always a new surprise , something of a shock , a paralysis . He glanced at Strang . " We 'd better push off , " he said , suddenly hating this job . " Ready ? " he asked Cecilia unnecessarily , and took charge of her coat and small case . " Effie is bringing the car around to the door . " He glanced at his watch . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He nodded to Strang and hurried out . Strang took Cecilia in his arms . " I 'll telephone you tomorrow . Stay at the Pringles ' until I get back . I 'll try to make it by tomorrow night . " " Take care , " she pleaded . " Please , Ken ! " " I always take care . " He kissed her . Soft lips , soft hair , soft cheeks , white throat . Abruptly , he let her go and opened the door . He glanced out into the corridor . Pringle was at the corner near the elevator , waving impatiently . Strang looked at her . She reached up and gave him a long kiss . And then she was hurrying toward Pringle.  |p300Strang  took a few steps after them . He halted . He heard the elevatordoor clang open ; shut . Slowly , he turned , and walked back to her room . He went through the sitting room , into her bedroom , and stood at one side of the French windows opening onto the balcony . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have crossed the sidewalk , must be in the car , before he stepped out onto the balcony . Too late , he thought , they 've gone . And at that moment he saw Pringle 's car , waiting down there for the traffic policeman 's signal . It was turning slowly , gathering speed . He watched it until it had disappeared from sight . He closed the windows , and looked around the room . It had becomea different place . There was only the faint remembrance of roses and jasmine . Behind him , Elias said briskly , " Miss Hillard has gone . Now we go " Strang looked at Elias . He said , " I  --  11 get my coat . " " At seven o'clock and ten minutes , come downstairs . Leave your key at the desk , walk out . Costas will bring the car forward , you get in . He will drive into Constitution Square , around , up . I shall meet you , then . You understand ? " " Costas  --  what does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver . You will know him . He searched you last night . " He stood aside politely to let Strang lead the way out . Strang said , " Would n't it be simpler if you just arrested Christophorou , right now ? " Elias looked horrified . Then he noticed Strang 's expression . " But you are not serious , " he said in relief . He raised one of his thin dark eyebrows , let a gleam of sardonic amusement enter his bright brown eyes , and gestured toward the door . American humor was crazy , too , he reminded himself . " We must wait . As you know , " he added politely . He shook his head , watching Strang leave . As I do n't know , Strang thought as he went upstairs . Or rather , I do know , but I do n't believe it . Sure , every contact that Christophoroumakes in the next twenty-four hours may lead to wider knowledge about the extent of the conspiracy . Give nowarning , arouse no suspicions , take every precaution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm no professional . I still think that one tiger within your sights is worth ten in any blasted thicket . In his room , he did a thorough , quick job of locking everything up . His drawings and his brief case , with so many months of hardp301research inside it , worried him . And the worry irritated him . Quickly , he gathered coat , toothbrush , razor , map , pocket dictionary . ( And , thank heavens , he had cashed that check today . ) Then , at the door , he turned and went back to pick up his drawingsand brief case . He 'd leave them at the manager 's office . Downstairs , he watched the manager 's assistant locking his work into a cavern of a safe . He had a moment of disquiet : what instinct had made him so excessively careful ? All right , it was done . He accepted the receipt , made small talk about the weather , eyed the clock , and left  --  exactly at eight minutes past seven  --  to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the busy street , his coat with its filled pockets over his arm , the well-stocked night travelerin search of his friend . A venerable , dark-blue Chrysler eased forward , halted , and Costas , now dressed in a cheap suit much too tight for him , ran around to hold open the rear door for his client . Strang gave a stiff , embarrassed nod . Willing or not , he thought as Costas slipped behind the wheel , here I go . Dusk came as they reached the Megara road , and then quick darkness . The broad busy highway running straight out from the city , lined by miles and miles of small flat-roofed houses , square white boxes , each set back in its own plot of Attica 's dry stony earth , had ended . Now they were on a well-paved road twisting along the shore of the Gulf of Athens , past summer cottages , shutteredand silent , built at the water 's edge ; past long rows of barracklike , dimly lit houses , set back on sloping fields , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were several cars on this road , all challenging Costas , whose idea of travel was emptiness ahead , a good engine with a powerful drive , a steady wheel under his hands , and an unbroken speed of eighty miles an hour . " Better now , " Elias said , breaking his long conversation with Costas to turn to speak to Strang for the first time . The sloping land was flattening out into a wide plain . Elias looked back at the cars they had passed , their headlights now sweeping away into another road . " They drive out to dinner , " he added , shaking his head . " Nothing else to do but take their women to dinner . " He spoke more in wonder than in envy . Then he gestured ahead . " The canal , " he said , and they were running smoothly over a long bridge . Strang saw , to his right , a dark straight line of water , seeminglyp302endless , laid deep between man-made cliffs , its spaced lights dwindlinginto a narrow ribbon toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pointed to the dark stretch of hills lying ahead . " Once we pass Corinth , we can make speed . " They did . The lights of Corinth vanished into the darkness behind them , and now there were only scattered groups of houses strung along the road that led through the hills , villages so small that the car had passed through the string of dim lights beforeit barely entered them . There was never a village so small , Strang noted , that it did n't have a room , open to the unpaved sidewalks , with a few tables and chairs where the men gathered together . He saw few women , and they all wore headcloths , the long scarves which they draped over their heads and across their mouths . It was strange to speed so quickly through these lives , glimpse the habit of centuries , see the wide curious eyes turned toward the car or a friendly arm raised , in quiet greeting , under the new electriclights . Then even the villages stopped , and there were only the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky with the stars beginning to take their stations . They swept past the lights of Argos , lying on its broad plain , and turned west toward the mountains . Thank God , the road was good , Strang thought . It twisted in sharp zigzags up a mountain 's face , straining to reach the top , the sharp drop on its outer side steadily heightening . " A fine view , " Elias said , pointing backward into the darkness . " I 'm sure it is , " Strang said , but he was too busy driving . He never sat in a car 's back seat with any comfort , but so far , Costas had refused any help ; he , too , seemingly , liked being at the wheel . " God in heaven ! " said Strang , as the car made almost a rightangledtwist , just grazing the black-and-white markers at the edge of a precipice , only two thousand feet high . Elias was pleased that the American was impressed by Greek road building . " Good ? Ten years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing . No markers . " He reflected a moment . " You go to Olympiasomeday ? Then you will see what I mean , " he said ominously . I 'll remember to travel by daylight , Strang told himself , as the car 's headlights picked out a smashed ten-foot stretch of low railingwhere a driver had guessed wrong and gone sailing right out into space.  | " Someone forgot to turn , " Costas said cheerfully , and he and Elias burst into a fit of laughter . Up and over the mountain , past a small guardhouse and curious soldiers , down again toward an enormous expanse of flatness stretching to farther mountains . The road was straight and easy , the moon was rising ; so Costas switched off his headlights . " Saves the battery , " he explained . It was a better habit at least , thought Strang , than switching off the ignition to coast down a mountain road . But the Greeks had made a fine art of little tricks like that . He tried to relax , failed , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonlight , neither nymphs nor satyrs were in sight , nor was there any sound of Pan 's pipe . There was only a monotonous series of wells , wells , and rows of willow trees , and wells , and hardworkedfields . Once , he saw a gypsy encampment , silent and withdrawn . Occasionally , he heard the howl of a dog . The road curved around a sudden hill , incongruously rising from the plain , and they saw a bright cluster of lights , a glowing island in the darkness . " Tripolis , " Elias said , pointing . " Petrol and food . You are hungry ? " " And a telephone call , " Strang said , eying the town . After the last thirty miles of nothing , it seemed almost a metropolis . " No time , " Elias said firmly , his brows frowning . " We 'll see , " said Strang . There was usually a little extra time in Greece , lying around to be picked up . He managed to find it , too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for almost three minutes before Elias tapped his shoulder . Strang joined the two men , silently , and got back into the car . Elias , still annoyed , glanced at him twice . Then , as they left the town by a white-walled street edged with mimosa trees , he twisted his head around to ask , anxiously , " She is good ? " Strang smiled . " Yes , she 's safe and well . " He closed his eyes , if only to be left with his own thoughts , rested his head back against the seat , felt reassurance spread from his mind down through his body . For the first time , on this strange journey , he relaxed . Elias was reaching over , shaking his knee . Strang came out of his half-sleep and sat up quickly , looking around dazedly . The black plain had gone . Now they were on a black mountainside , following a rougher road which seemed to be running along a high pass.  | " Not yet , not yet , " Elias said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strang nodded . It was , he saw from his watch , almost midnight . " About twenty-five kilometers to go , " Elias said . Roughly fifteen miles more , thought Strang . He stretched his back , put the pleasant dreams away , looked out at the wild mountainside . No lights at all . No villages . Just the rocks and night sky , and small rough fields where the stones had been cleared and piled into little thin columns that might have been markers or monuments but , in the fitful moonlight , looked more like some sad graveyard for a long retreat . " We should soon be there , " Strang said . Elias shrugged his shoulders . Then Strang saw what he meant . Costas had slackened speed to a crawl of twenty miles an hour , and even slowed below that as they approached a stretch of road weakened by a spring torrent or a fall of stones from the mountain 's side . They were starting down a long decline , carefully , still in gear , this time , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elias said , very seriously , " Myrrha Kladas believes that Stefanos is dead and that Nikos is still alive . " He paused , hesitated , and then asked , " Do you know much about Myrrha Kladas ? " " Very little . " Elias brooded . Then he spoke in Greek . " She was fifteen when the war started , and for two years she saw more murder and hate and bitterness than an American would see in all his life . When her father was killed , she left Thalos . She went to join her brothers . These facts we do know . We also know she came back to the villagein 1945 . We do not know why she came back . It might have been a revulsion against the cruelties of Ares  --  he destroyed the politicalfaith of many of his followers . If that were the reason , good : you can trust her . But if she came back because Odysseus had abandonedher for the woman who called herself Elektra  --  then , that is not good : you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the American . " You understand what I am saying ? " Strang wondered if he had . " I think so , " he said slowly . Elias repeated his information in English , which had becomehalting and difficult as he struggled with his own embarrassment . It was unpleasant to talk of such things , but necessary . Strang was silent . Then , at last , he said , " Steve did not know about that . "  | " A pity . Or he would have killed Odysseus . That would have saved us all much trouble . " " Elektra  --  " Strang began . It was none of his business . Elias said , " She left him , on orders , when she met the rich Frenchman after the war . " " On orders ? " Now , I 've got that wrong , thought Strang . " On orders , " Elias repeated calmly . " The Frenchman 's fortune was too useful to let slip out of the party 's grasp . She lived with the old fool for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  he married her . " Elias looked at Strang . " Americans know everythingabout love , I have heard . Do they ? " Strang shook his head . " That was harsh discipline , " he said slowly . How had Christophorou brought himself to accept it ? How could a man . . . He checked his thoughts . How or why were no longer of importance . What mattered now was the extent and depth of Christophorou 's bitterness and hate . " Each tree bears its own fruit . " Elias shrugged his shoulders . " And each grows according to the ground where it sinks its roots . " Except , Strang thought , a man is not a tree ; a man has the choice where he will sink his roots . Costas spoke suddenly . " How much of that fortune is left ? " Elias gave a contemptuous laugh . " Keep your eyes on the road . " " There must be something left , " Costas insisted . " Yes , safe in Swiss banks in numbered accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame Duval 's signature is no longer needed . " He sat erect , his eyes scanning the side of the road . " Slow , slow ! The village is near . Is there enough moon ? Then cut those lights ! " Strang looked out . They were slipping gently downhill , a rise of woods and sparse olive trees on their left , a falling slope of small patches of plowed earth and olive groves on their right . There was a broad valley , far below , a black snaking river in its center , orchards and large fields in the flat rich bottomland , and , beyondthem , a wall of mountains . " Is that snow up there ? " he asked , or was it a trick of the night and the moon ? " Even in June , the snow lies there . " Elias smiled . " You would like to cross these mountains ? Another time . " He stretched his arm toward a distant point in the valley far below . " Sparti ! " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the car eased its way to a gentle halt beside a narrow rough earth road , leading up to the left between the olive trees  --  " here is Thalos. "  |p306Strang  said quickly , " She 's waiting at the bridge , a kilometer ahead . " Elias nodded . He looked at his watch , and nodded again , this time approvingly . To Costas , he said , " Twenty minutes after we leave , drive slowly toward the bridge with full headlights . Pass over the bridge . Keep on until you reach the plain . Wait there for half an hour . Then come back ; keep your lights low . When you reach the shadow of that bank  --  " he pointed across the road , about sixty feet ahead of them  --  " draw in close . Turn off your lights . That 's where we 'll meet you . " Silently , the two Greeks compared their watches . Elias gave furtherdirections : if there was no sign of the American and himself by two o'clock , Costas must drive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . He turned to Strang . " Are you armed ? " he asked crisply . " With a penknife , " Strang said with a grin . " Inadequate , " Elias said coldly . This was no time , seemingly , for any jokes . But he did n't offer anything less inadequate . Probably , Strang thought , he does n't think that I can be trusted with a gun , or that I 'd hit anything except some harmless peasant or even Elias himself . He pulled off his coat . " You 'll need that , " Elias told him . " We 're walking , are n't we ? " And probably crawling around on our bellies if Elias has his way , Strang thought . It was a fairly obviousremark , but Elias looked surprised , as if he had n't quite expecteda foreigner either to make such a deduction or to leave the comfort of a good coat behind him . He stepped out of the car , and slipped down out of sight by an olive tree at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Strang , but he opened the right-hand door and followed Elias . " Come ! " Elias told him in a whisper , and , crouching low , started back along the sloping hill , following the road , keeping well under the shadow of its shoulder . When he had retraced almost fifty yards of highway , he stopped , again by an olive tree , straightened his back , looked down the road . Strang looked , too . The car was out of sight , hidden by a curving outcrop of rock . And here , too , the opposite bank was high , throwing its shadow almost as far across as their olive tree . Elias went first , slipping over the road like a ghost in the night . He signaled , and Strang followed . Then they climbed the high bank and started forward again , using the olive trees for cover , heading once more in the direction of Thalos . Neat , thought Strang , but was it necessary ? Certainly anyone whop307had been watching the car must have lost sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elias enjoyed this kind of thing . He was in a better humor , definitely ; the annoyance , almost antagonism , he had shown at the Acropolis had vanished . Perhaps , again , he might think this job worth doing , interesting at least , more in keepingwith his dignity than playing nursemaid to two bewildered Americans . What was his rank ? Strang wondered : lieutenant , or even captain ? Elias raised a hand for caution as they reached the rough narrow road that would lead up the hillside to Thalos . Again they chose a shadowed patch before they crossed it , one by one . This may not be necessary , Strang decided , but it certainly is a good way to keep a man warm . And alert . For in spite of his secret amusement , his senses had come alive . His eyes were accustomed to the shadows now ; he could hear the quiet ripple of water over stones long before he reached the stream ; he could smell the upturned earth where a patch of field had been plowed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around an outcrop of boulders . Elias 's plan , obviously , was to approach the bridge from the rear . He halted as they saw the stream and a path , edging it , which must lead from the bridge on the road up this sloping hill to the Kladas house . The village must lie up in that direction , too . But from where they had stopped , Strang could see nothing beyond the dark shadowed glen which cradled the rushing stream , except a massive black curtain of hill and mountain held up against the night sky . Then Elias was hurrying on , through the sparse olive grove where each tree seemed to be fighting for its life , westward , following the course of the stream to the bridge . They stopped once more , in the shade of a tree . Elias gestured sharply with his hand , and knelt . Strang lowered himself gently onto a low boulder . Downhill , in the shadows in front of them , there were two olive trees , a sudden deepening of the stream 's bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  --  some thirty yards away from where Strang sat  --  the stone bridge . There was no one there . Strang 's eyes searched for Myrrha Kladas along the opposite bank of the stream . He could see the path , some bright patches of moonlight , some black shadows , boulders and trees , but nothing else . There was a slight rustle of leaves in the night wind , the gurgling rush of water as the stream surged under the bridge toward the other side of the road to plunge on its way down the hillside . But there was nothing else . He looked at Elias , but Elias was lookingp308carefully at the luminous dial of his watch . It had been nice timing , thought Strang . He could hear Costas bringing the car leisurely down the road toward the bridge . As the first faint beam from its distant headlights rested on the surface of the bridge , a tree 's shadow , down there , came to life . A woman , heavily bundled in dark clothes , stepped forward toward the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Strang was about to say " So she did wait ! " two men came out of the shadows behind the woman . One gripped her arms and pulled her back behind the tree , the other chose another tree nearer the bridge . And now a third man moved from the boulder beside which he had sat so motionless and took his position behind a clump of bushes at a corner of the bridge . Elias may have expected something odd , but he was obviously as puzzled by all this as Strang was . He drew out a revolver , thoughtfully , and watched the bridge with narrowed eyes . The two men , who had taken cover near the road , crouched down as the full beam from the headlights struck the bridge . There was no movementfrom the tree 's shadow that hid Myrrha Kladas and the third man . The car traveled smoothly over the slight rise of the bridge and was gone . Now , thought Strang , what the hell does that mean ? There had been no attempt to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into his pocket , as thoughtfully as he had produced it . So he , too , had expected an attack on the car . And then the storm broke . The man crouching behind the corner of the bridge leaped up onto the road and looked after the car . The other , at the tree by the bridge , yelled back toward the shadows , " He has gone ! He did not stop ! He did not stop ! " " Shut up . He 'll come back ! " " He 's gone , " the first man reported . " He is n't coming back . He 's going down . " He stood well over to the edge of the road , his hands on his hips , a broad-backed figure in a heavy coat , staring into the valley . There was a sudden stirring , and the others came out from cover . The three men clustered together on the road , the woman waited beside the tree . A man turned toward her , speaking angrily . The woman answeredsharply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She retreatedup the path , just across the stream from the olive tree underp309whose shadows Strang and Elias lay . " You were beside me when I telephoned . You heard , " she was saying contemptuously . " I gave the right directions . " She halted and faced him . The man spoke angrily . " That is right , " she said scornfully , " blame me ! Waste your time blaming me ! He is an American . He does n't know this road . Perhaps he did not see the signpost to Thalos . Perhaps he can not read the Greek letters . How slow you are to think of the real reasons ! " The man was silenced . " Why did you not let me step onto the bridge ? " the woman demanded . " He would have known where to stop , then . " " Yes . And you could have warned him  --  " The woman laughed . " Why should I die for an American ? " The others left the bridge and came up the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " Stupid ! " she taunted them . " An American will not spend the night searching for a little road . He will sleep in Sparta , and come back here in daylight . That is the practical thing . Americans are practical . They do not waste time looking for a road they can not find in the dark . " She turned and left them , walking up the path by the stream , slowly , with dignity . The angry man took a step after her . But another caught his arm . After a little more argument , the three went back to the road , angry , baffled , straggling , as if they still had not made up their minds what to do . But when they reached it , they started down its slope . Well , thought Strang , moving a numbed leg , if our Costas is too eager and does n't wait a full half hour in the valley , we have another problem . He glanced at Elias . He , too , was worried . Strang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , striking into his bones like a knife . Let 's move , he thought irritably , and half rose . Elias caught his arm and pulled him back . They heard a car , which must have been parked not too far down the road , start up with a hacking cough . At last , the motor turned over smoothly . Headlights swept over the bridge , pointing northward up the long hill . The car passed . Its motor pulled heavily , droning into a faint hum , lessening gradually into nothing . " Now ! " Elias said , rising . He started at a quick pace up the glen , in the direction of the Kladas house.  |p310It  was a small house , standing alone , low in spite of its two stories , nestling against the hillside as if the winter winds were still blowingfrom the north . Its front was in shadow , with only deeper shadowsto suggest windows . They were few , and all tightly shuttered . In contrast to the dark front , the rippling tiles of the gently sloping roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaves , a square blackened hole which might have been a chimney . It was a peaceful house , a sleeping house , completely innocent . To one side , there was a stretch of plowed field , enclosed by a stone wall , rising steeply , ending in rough harsh boulders . And past the front door went the path , widening now , still following the stream , curving round to run straight into an earth road bordered with several dwellings . It was something of a surprise to Strang to find the village so close . The road from the main highway and the path from the bridge were not parallel , as he had supposed : they converged into this broad stretch of bare earth , edged by a row of buildings on one side , by the stream and a scattering of trees on the other . Ever : - thing here slept deeply . Even the stream , flowing along the broad ledge of land on which the houses had grown , silenced its busy chatterto a soft murmur . Elias had stopped , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come upon the Kladas place . In spite of the fast pace they had kept , they had not caught up with Myrrha Kladas . They were on the wrong side of the stream , too . They 'd have to cross it , step out of the shelter of the trees , and risk that moonlit stretch of bare path before they could reach the black shadow of the house.  |p311Elias  cursed quietly as he looked across at the door , closely barred and bolted for the night . He had been so very sure that they would overtake Myrrha Kladas before she could reach it . " Only one entrance ? " Strang whispered . Elias shrugged his shoulders . Perhaps he had not been allowed to see any other entrance on his visit yesterday . Uncommunicative , the Colonel had called Myrrha Kladas . " How do you get across this stream ? " " Now ? " " Yes . " Strang 's eyes were searching the stream for some footbridge : no village let itself be cut off from its fields . " There is Costas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , frowningwith worry . He looked at his watch . " Soon he will start uphill from the valley . Those three may be patrolling the road . He must be told what to expect . " " Perhaps they 've gone back to where they came from . " " To Tripolis ? And then here again , in the morning ? No . " The frown deepened . The men had come from a town ; their clothes were not those of peasants . Or were they staying in a village to the north ? Elias sighed . He looked at his watch again . " Will she open that door ? " he asked . His tone doubted that . " Perhaps for me , if I 'm alone , " Strang said . " You get back to the bridge and start down toward the valley . " Then , as Elias kept silent , he added , " If anything happens to that car , it 's a long walk back to Athens . " Elias gave a fleeting smile . " You stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there . " Strang pointed at the house . " But those men may decide to come back . Did you not hear them arguing ? " " Then all the more reason I should be with Myrrha Kladas . " Elias looked at him . " It 's warm , over there , " Strang said . " I like my comforts . " He took a step away . " Where 's the nearest crossing ? Or do I have to swim ? " " There is a small footbridge , " Elias said , pointing near them . He was converted . " Good . " Strang could n't see the footbridge for the shadows of the trees at that part of the stream . " Ask her  --  " Elias had a new set of worries . " I 'll ask her plenty , " Strang said grimly . " Signal when you get back  --  "  |p312But  Elias was gone . Strang waited for a few moments , admiring Elias 's technique : the man melted into the shadows , moving quickly , silently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , to travel back downhill to the bridge . Strang glanced at his own watch . Speed was certainly needed ; Costas would soon be starting up from the valley . Arguments , arguments , Strang thought with annoyance ; everyone wants to get his own way in this country  --  including me . He looked over at the silent house , glanced along the village street . All was quiet . He started toward the trees where the footbridge ought to be . It was there , all right , a couple of long planks balanced on some rocks , a simple but practical peasant 's reply to inevitable spring floods . Strang crossed , carefully , his eyes concentrating on the middle of the planks . On his right , the stream gathered speed through a scatteringof small boulders and then  --  so his ears told him  --  plunged into its race through the glen . He reached the other bank , and then , past an outcrop of rock and bushes , the path . There was a small stretch of thin wood here , slender-trunked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted . Sheep ? Had one strayed down from the hillside ? For now he could smell the unmistakable , strong , heavy odor of sheep , remindinghim of that mutton-fat gravy tonight at Tripolis . But there was no rustle , no movement . The sheep was dead , perhaps , carried down by the stream . He started up the dark path , soft under his feet , between the ghostly white-limbed ladies . There was a quick movement behind him , a stronger smell of sheep . An arm was round his throat , a hand was pinning his right arm to his side , and , for a moment , he was paralyzed , pulled tightly against a filthy sheepskin tunic . He let himself go limp , as if he were beaten ; and as he felt the arm slacken a little , sure of him , he jerked his head violently back and smashed against a face . There was a grunt of pain , the arm loosened , and Strang could turn on the man . But as his left fist shot out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strong savage grip ; and a third dark figure , a woman , raised a heavy stick and struck at his head . He stumbled forward , the man 's weight now on his back . There was another blow at his head , a crashing pain followed by a wave of blackness . He tried to rise , failed , and felt the first retreat from consciousness . Complete blackness swept over , and smothered him . The woman stood looking down at Strang . " Is he dead ? " she asked , tonelessly , almost listlessly.  |p313One  of the men knelt . " You did not hit hard enough , " he said angrily . Women were like that , always flinching at the last moment , always leaving a job half done . " Which one is it ? " she asked . " The tall one , as you saw . " " There were two who were tall , " she said sharply . She bent down and touched the man lying at her feet , and then drew back quickly . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . " " He has taken off his coat . That is all . Levadi  --  " he looked up at the big man with the sheepskin over his shoulders , who was wiping the blood from his nose with his wrist  --  " shove him in the stream ! " The woman said , " More than taking off his coat . The jacket is different . Of wool , fine wool . " She knelt and touched Strang 's hair . She tried to see his face through the shadows . " A stranger , " she said . " A foreigner . Fetch Petros ! " Strang 's eyes opened . He did n't move . His head throbbed , his throat was painful . He was lying on hard boards , in half-darkness ; but he was warm , at least , with a rough blanket around him . There was the smell of a wood fire , a soft flickering light on the low ceiling . Cautiously , he turned his head . The pain stopped him . He began to remember . He lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of his eye , he saw a table , and two people . A woman and a man , sittingsilently by the light of the fire , waiting . Then he realized his hands and feet were free , unbound ; someone had put a pillow under his head ; someone had wrapped him carefully in this blanket . " Hello , there ! " he said slowly , and tried to sit up . The dim room swung round him , but he got his feet on the floor and kept them there . Now if he could just manage to sit this way for a couple of minutes , no sudden movements , no efforts , he might be able to raise his head , too , and look normal . The woman exclaimed , moved to light a candle . The man came over to the bed and looked at Strang , who slowly raised his head . " How do you feel ? " he asked in English . Like the way one of those wobbly-headed , three-month-old infantsmust feel , thought Strang . " Fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Petros , grinning broadly . " Was it you who hit me ? " " Myrrha did that . Fortunately . " " Fortunately ? " Petros said , " I would have cracked your skull properly . " He gave an encouraging pat to Strang 's shoulder , a good-natured thumpp314which echoed right up through the roof of his head . Then Petros sat down beside him , on the wooden platform of a bed . " 1n fact , you nearly ended in that stream . " " Spectacular exit , " Strang said , seeing himself being hurtled in the fast-moving waters under the road and out onto the valley 's slopes . He laughed . And stopped . And held his head . Myrrha Kladas exclaimed again , this time in sympathy . She offered him a glass of water . Petros started explaining , " She thought you were one of them . And you chose the darkest shadows . She saw a man moving , butshe could n't see the man clearly . What were you doing out there ? " " Watching the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " More ? " she asked , politely , anxiously . He said , " Please . " He looked at her as she poured the water , and he wondered if this could really be Myrrha Kladas . She ought to be a woman a little younger than himself . But only her eyes , dark and glowing , were young . The skin , tanned into wrinkled leather by sun and wind , the lines at the sad mouth , the gaunt cheeks , the coarsened hair , the veined hands , all these belonged to age . She was of medium height , but she looked small : her body was so thin , stripped of all fat right down to its fine bone and muscle , that the cotton dress hung from her slight shoulders as a shapeless piece of cloth . And he thought of her father , of her two brothers , of Christophorou , who had all abandoned her in their own fashion : some women had not much to thank men for . " This water is very good , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked politely , in turn . " As thick as ever . " She did n't quite understand . " As good as this bed . " He rapped on the solid piece of wood , then rapped on his head , and said , " Ow ! " She laughed , her eyes inviting Petros to join in the joke . For a moment , he saw a young woman . Then her hand went quickly up to her mouth to cover it politely , shyly . " So , " Petros said , " you were watching the bridge . And who was the man who left you to go back to the bridge ? " Hegestured to Myrrha . " Sure , we can talk in English . She understands , although she wo n't speak it . " He looked at Strang , his eyes narrowing . " Was he a policeman ? " " No . Counterintelligence . " " And what does that mean ? "  |p315Strang  allowed himself a good Greek shrug of the shoulders . " He has gone to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back here ? " " Yes . " " Do you trust them ? " " Yes . " " Hm , " said Petros . " What do they want ? " " They want Steve to stay alive . " There was silence . Myrrha Kladas said , " Are you sure of that ? " " That 's one thing I am sure of . " " They do not pretend ? " " I am sure of that , too . " Myrrha Kladas and Petros exchanged a long thoughtful look . Then she said , " I believe the American . " Petros said , " We do n't want any policemen around here . " He pointed across the room , and Strang saw a rifle propped at the side of the door . " My friend John has a gun , too . We keep them private , hidden , you understand . For any  --  well  --  any trouble . But the policedo n't like guns . They take them away . " " Is John the man with the sheepskin ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's her friend . " He pointed at Myrrha . " Why do n't you tell Levadi he is no longer a shepherd ? " he asked her teasingly . " Or why do n't you wash his coat ? Or him ? " " He does no one any harm , " she flashed out . " He stayed my friend when others forgot me . " " Ah ! " said Petros , his eyes narrowing . " And why did they forgetyou ? Just look at a few burned-out houses around here , will you ? " Strang asked quickly , " Where are John and Levadi ? " " Outside . On guard . " Petros was still looking bitterly at MyrrhaKladas . " We expect a little trouble . " " Then you 'd better tell them that my two friends are coming back here . I do n't want to have them floating down any stream . " Petros stopped looking at Myrrha Kladas . He rose , yawned , and stretched . " What do they look like ? " Strang described Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No ! " " Okay , okay . " Petros clumped heavily toward the door . " Sh ! " said Myrrha Kladas.  | " Okay ! " Petros said in a softened growl , picked up his rifle , and left . " Myrrha , " Strang said very gently , " where is Steve ? " She was at the door , barring it . She turned and looked at him . " Do you know that he is alive ? " She nodded . " Petros told me everything you told him . " But Petros would not have been sitting here if he had n't found Steve . That was certain . Besides , there was no air of mourning in this house , no gloom . Petros would not have jeered at her , lost his temper , if Steve had been dead . And Myrrha Kladas would not be facing Strang so calmly , either , at this moment : village women took mourning seriously and were not easily comforted . " Why  --  why  --  " he began . He was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no help at all . " Why did you telephone ? " he asked with painful slowness . He put a hand over his forehead and held it there . She looked at him anxiously . Then she said , " I speak English , if Petros is not here to laugh at my mistake . I lived in America once . " As she spoke , she went to a wooden chest , found a piece of white cloth , soaked it with cold water , and came over to wrap it across his brow . " Lie back , " she told him . " You do not have to pretendfor me . " He lay back on the bed . He watched her lift a chair and bring it beside him . She sat down . " Now , " she said softly , " we talk . " " Why did you telephone ? " " I had no choice . " " But it was a trap . I might have ended in that stream after all , " he reminded her . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream . " " Then they would have hurt you . " " John and Levadi were near . " He was startled . " Where ? " " Very near . John had his rifle ready . " She frowned at her hands , neatly folded in her lap . " It was the best we could do . " Then , slowly , she told him what had happened . That noon , when she came back from working in the field , she found two strangers searching this house . Levadi was still in the field . She had tried to run out , to call , but one of the men had stopped her . They came as friends , they said . Her brother Stefanos was not dead ; he was alive and in hiding because there were enemies , men who had once been his comrades , who remembered that he had been a deserter.  |p317Stefanos  , so they said , had sent them to find her , and to prove that , they had shown her a little diary with her brother 's writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kenneth Strang . Stefanoswould come to Thalos tonight , and meet his friend in this house . " You see ? " she asked anxiously . " They told me I must telephone you . Because you would believe me when I said it was urgent ; but you had never heard of them , and you might not listen to them . So I was to go with them into Sparta , and telephone you . At once ! But I said I could not go into the big town with mud on my boots , and in my old dress from the fields . So they said they would wait for me at the road by the bridge , where their car and their driver were . You see ? " Yes , he was beginning to see . " But then , " she said , " as I went down through the little wood , I found Petros . And he told me a different story . He was unshaven , there was mud on his clothes , and he looked as if he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Stefanos . And so I believed him . For I knew him . We talked . And he made a plan . He wanted me to telephone you . Flow else could we bring you here quickly ? But we have no money for telephones to Athens , so  --  you see ? " " Yes , " Strang said . " You let the strangers pay for the call , and you got me out here as Petros wanted . " " But you understood my warning , " she said . " And you brought friends . " He looked at her . " When I called Stefanos ' Steve , ' you understood that I had learned about the name you give him . " He could n't disappoint her by admitting he had not fully understood . But Colonel Zafiris had understood , perhaps not fully , either , but enough to send Elias and Costas along . " And , " Myrrha said triumphantly , " how could I learn such a name if I had not been speaking to Stefanos or Petros ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men stood beside me as I telephoned . " She laughed . " What money they spent ! I telephoned at three o'clock , four o'clock , five o'clock , six  --  and there you were , at last . " " Who paid for all that ? " Her laughter died away . She sat very still . " Since I talked with Stefanos , I think I know . Odysseus  --  a man I met many years ago ,  |p318when  we took strange names and hid behind them . There was reason then . But now  --  he still hides behind Odysseus . " " Did he come to see you , some weeks ago ? " She stared at Strang . " Yes . About Stefanos . He wanted to warn Stefanos not to come to Greece . " " That old excuse about Steve deserting ? " " You believe he did ? " " No . " Her face softened . " No , " she agreed . " But I believed Odysseus about the danger . Some people might want to have revenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask about the other side . " She bit her lip . " I know , " she said . " Once , I heard only one side ... . " And so you told Odysseus where he could find Steve to warn him . " " Yes . I told him Steve would be in Sicily before he came to Greece . " He sat up slowly and swung his legs onto the floor . " Can I go upstairs and see Steve now ? " He handed her the cloth from his head . It had n't helped much , but he thanked her . " He is asleep . I gave him a drink of herbs to make him asleep . " She looked at him curiously . " How did you know he was here ? " " Why else are you all guarding this house so carefully ? " She smiled then . " Petros brought him here when I went with these men into Sparta . " " It would have been safer , perhaps , to leave him where Petros found him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him  --  " " At the old place ? " She nodded . " Up on the hill , below the mountain ridge . There is an old castle there . In ruins . The Franks built it , many years ago . " Six hundred years ago , most probably , Strang thought , if the French knights had built it . " And the Albanian soldiers of the Turks destroyed it , " she was saying . " Every man was killed . The women were  --  were destroyed . The children taken as slaves . Nothing left  --  a few walls . A little church , without a roof . " She sighed . " But not enough shelter for a man who was sick . " " How sick ? " he asked quickly . " A bullet was in his shoulder . Something here "  --  she put a hand over her right ribs  --  " is not good . He walked and climbed , over  |p319these  mountains , for two nights and a day . His feet  --  " She shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I made him sleep . " Strang got onto his feet . " I 'll have a look . No , do n't worry  --  I sha n't waken him . " He stood very still . " What was that ? " She was on her feet , her hand deep in the pocket of her skirt . " It could be the morning wind . It rises before dawn . " They stood listening . There was only silence now . " Do you expect these men from Tripolis to come back ? " " They will come back . You are very important to Odysseus , Mr. Strang . " If so , thought Strang , he is a little late ; the time to get me out of Athens was yesterday , before I could talk with Colonel Zafiris . " I hear nothing , " Myrrha said , and took her hand out of her pocket . " What made you think these men come from Tripolis ? " " Their clothes , mostly . And they traveled north . Tripolis is the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Tripolis , " she said . " But they do not come from there . " It was a nice Greek distinction . But he was thinking now of the timing of the telephone calls . Three o'clock was the first one . If Cecilia and he had separated after lunch  --  most people did , falling into the Mediterranean custom of the long rest after the midday meal  --  he would have been in his room for that first call , he would have been on his way to Sparta before Cecilia even came downstairs and had picked up that note signed " Katherini . " And Cecilia would have kept that appointment . Myrrha was looking at him . " There is something wrong ? " she asked , sensing his tenseness . She listened . " No , " she decided . " Nothing . " She sat down at the table , and watched him curiously . The last flicker of the dying fire threw faint , glancing shadows over his face . But there were deeper shadows there , too , she thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sat down opposite her . She said , " I remembered one of them . He did not know me . But men do not change so much as women . I knew him . He did many things for Odysseus . " She shivered . Then she said , " Levadi rememberedhim , too . Once , before the war , they both lived near Parnassos . That is to the north . On the mainland , " she explained politely . " And during the war ? "  | " They both followed Odysseus . Levadi knew my brothers , too . " " Levadi  --  that is a strange name . " " That is not his real name . It is the place he came from . " " Why does n't he go back there ? " " After the war , some men could not go back . " He looked at her . " You trust him ? " " He has been here for almost thirteen years . Without him , I could not have worked my farm . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not then . People forget slowly . But  --  " she paused  --  " they do forget . A little . There is peace here . Work and peace and food . That is all Levadi wants . " " But how did he know where to find you ? " " Oh , people find people , " she said vaguely . Then she brushed aside the American 's doubts . " In Greece , many people were made refugees , many left their villages , many went looking for friends , many found new places . Levadi is not so difficult to understand . " " Is n't he ? You said he followed Odysseus once . " " But he rebelled , " she said softly . " Like my brother Stefanos , he rebelled . Yet they are so different . Stefanos , he thinks much . He rebelled  --  " she touched her forehead  --  " here . Levadi does not think . He never questions . He feels . " She touched her heart . " He rebelled , there . " She closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . She drew a deep breath . " When Odysseus came here a few weeks ago , did he see Levadi ? Did he talk to him ? " She looked puzzled . " Yes . At first , Levadi would n't listen . He ran up the hill , behind this house . But Odysseus followed him . " " And he patched up their quarrel , whatever it was ? " " I did not ask any questions , " she said coldly . " I do not think you should ask them . It was a personal matter , between them . Not politics . Levadi was jealous , once , of Odysseus . Oh , not because of me . Someone quite different , someone who --  " She halted , listening . The strange sound , breaking through the lonely night , died away . " Did you hear ? " Strang was on his feet , too . The sharp rasping call of a night bird was repeated . " A screech owl , perhaps , " he said . " Or Petros . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is a warning . The men are coming back . " Strang said , " Look  --  they do n't know that Steve is here , do they ? " " No. "  | " Then they are coming for me . " They must have seen Elias and Costas returning in the car from the valley , and they had assumed it was the American still searching for Thalos . Strang pointed to her pocket . " Do you know how to use that revolver ? " Myrrha drew it out . " Petros gave it to me . " " Can you use it ? " he repeated . " I have not forgotten . " " Then bar this door solidly . Stay here . Do n't open a window . If the men come here , do n't let them in . Tell them you did n't let me in , either . You never let anyone inside at night . That 's your story . " She watched him lift the door 's bar out of its heavy sockets . " No  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If they catch me , they wo n't take me far . Petros is out there . And Elias , I hope . " He edged the door open , first ajar , then a few more inches . The end of the village street and the beginning of the path lay before him . Thank God , the room had been dark ; his eyes did n't have to get accustomed , all over again , to the night 's shadows . He could hear no rustle , see no movements . They were n't near the house then . Not yet . He opened the door and slipped through . Behind him , the door was closed quietly . He kept close to the wall of the house , to the heavy black line of darkness under the eaves . At the corner , he stepped into the path , walking lightly through its shadows . Now , he was out of them , into the open , and he slowed his pace , as if he had no reason to hurry . He halted by the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were wondering what he should do next . Then , he began , slowly , to walk down the path toward the woods . If there was anyone watching from the distance , they would see him clearly . If they wanted him , they would know where to find him . And if I 've guessed wrong , he thought , as he approached the first tree , if Petros is n't anywhere near here , then  --  There was a sharp crack , splitting the night . A spurt of earth and stones shot up ahead of him , to the side of the path . He raced for the wood , dived into the undergrowthas a second shot cut the ground behind him . And somewheredogs began barking . He lay flat on his face , his head beginning to throb again . Someonetugged at his arm . It was Petros . " Here , " Petros whispered , getting him off the path , pulling him behind a clump of bushes . " And what little game were you playing , my friend ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That back of yours  --  it tempted them . It asked them , it begged them to shoot . "  |p322Elias  suddenly appeared beside them . " A mistake , " he observed in a whisper . " Now we know where that fellow is . " He pointed to the field on the hillside above the house . He frowned . " But why there ? " he asked himself . " And why , " Strang asked , equally puzzled , keeping his voice to a whisper , too , " do n't they follow me ? " " You like trouble , " Petros said . Then , as he heard a rustle near them , he gestured with his arm . " John ! " he whispered , and a man rose from the underbrush and came quietly to join them . " What do you see , out there ? " Petros asked him . " Eyes like a cat , " Petros explained to Strang as John moved to get a clear view . " Where 's Levadi ? " Strang asked . Petros shrugged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its stone wall . " Around , someplace . " " Why do n't they follow me ? " Strang asked again , with exasperation . This was uncanny . Two shots , then silence . " Or do they think they hit me ? " " They nearly did , " Elias said grimly . Or perhaps they want to make sure I 'm alone , Strang thought , and unarmed . It was uncanny . The dogs were barking wildly now , but the village still lay in darkness , as if it had pulled the blankets over its head , determined to hear and see nothing . John whispered hoarsely , " Four of them ! " The man who had fired from the cover of the stone wall around the field had risen . Two others were coming down from the hillside above him . They seemed to think that cover was no longer necessary . " Three are going to the house , " John said . Petros was on his feet . " Keep down ! " Elias whispered angrily . Strang said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " Stefanos Kladas is in that house , " Strang insisted . " And these men know . They know . That 's why they did n't come after me . " John said , " I can not see them now . The house hides them . " Elias rose quickly , taking a whistle out of his pocket , giving a clear sharp blast . From the other end of the village street came an answering whistle . Petros and John were starting up the path . Elias yelled to Strang , " Stay there ! Stay there ! " Then he was racing after Petros and John , and catching up with them , too . From the olive trees on the other side of the stream , men ran out andp323splashed through the water to the village street . And along there , a car was starting up , gathering speed to reach the house . So I come out , get shot at , and stay here , Strang thought : the hell I do . He started after the others , halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , the roof ! " For a man was clambering up there , half crouching as he reached the ridge , half rising as he started a hobbling run toward the chimney , his right arm raised to throw . Petros and John both fired . The man 's step veered ; he seemed to take three running steps right down the front of the roof before he fell and clattered the rest of the way to plunge over its broad eave . His body landed in front of the house , and , a split second later , exploded into a flash of gray light , a balloon of smoke . Strang 's sense of complete helplessness vanished . He ran toward the low stone wall encircling the field , just about the point where the sharpshooter had hidden . Petros , Elias , and John had reached the house and were fanning around it , along with the men who had crossed the stream . The car had arrived , too , screeching to a halt just as the grenade had gone off , and three men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men there to take care of any trouble , Strang thought . There was plenty , too ; another explosion sent him ducking behind the wall . He heard the frenzied scream of a horse or a donkey , the bleatings of goats ; back in the village , the dogs had gone crazy . He swung his legs over the roughly laid loose stones , and landed in the field as there was a third explosion . To his left , near the house , there was a shot , then three more , a sudden surge of men , another burst of firing , then silence . But what interested him was the field . Up there , somewhere up there , near the top of the steeply plowed furrows , he had seen a lumbering shadow . That must be the fourth man whom the lynxeyedJohn had spied . He started up the hill , and stumbled over a dog , lying wide-eyed , its throat slit . So that was why he had heard no dog barking its warning from the Kladas house . Quickly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost at the top of the field . Someone called after him ; he waved , and ran on . If he took his eyes away from that shadow , he 'd lose it . It was heavy , slow travel , uphill through the field 's soft earth , and ruination for a careful spring planting . Behind him , Petros called again , but he went on . He was near the top of the field now ; there was the low stone wall in front of him . And beyond it , a bleak beginning to a mountainside , boulders and rocks scattered over rough grass , a distant cliff face , a ridge of high peaks lined sharplyp324against the eastern sky . Dawn was coming from the other side , a hint of green-gray behind the ragged rim of mountain , the stars fading , a cold wind rising . Strang climbed over the wall , and then halted , his eyes searching the mountainside , while he got his breathing once more under control . He swallowed in hot , heavy gulps , feeling the saliva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket collar up , the lapels over , and thrust his hands deep into his pockets ; up here , the wind had an edge like a hatchet . He took a few last deep breaths , and he had steadied himself again . And then he saw the man in the bulky sheepskin tunic . It was Levadi , all right . He had stopped , near a large boulder almost as tall as he was , and he had turned to face Strang . Friendly or not ? Strang wondered , noting the long , heavy stick on which Levadi , grasping it at shoulder height , rested his weight . Strang , his hands still in his pockets , walked slowly up toward a goat path , a foot-broad , winding ribbon of worn earth . No suddenmovements , he thought , as he reached it , no loud noises : just this steady plodding , up the goat path , one slow foot in front of another , eyes on that strange bulky shape that looked in this halflightlike a shaggy animal standing on two human legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within smellingdistance , he thought wryly , but just outside the swing of that long stave . He looked at the man , seeing his face for the first time . " Good morning , " he said , speaking in Greek , slowly . The man said nothing , his eyes staring intently from under heavy brows at the stranger , still suspicious , still waiting for the first sign of attack . " A fine view , " Strang said , and looked briefly down over the valley . And it was a view to startle anyone . Strang had to force his eyes quickly back to the man and that stave . But Levadi had looked down over the dark valley , too , and then beyond , to the far-off giants of western mountains , their white peaks tinged with gold and mauve and pink , gleaming through the veils of soft trailing clouds . And he stood there , silent , his wild eyes watching as they , perhaps , watched each morning . For a long minute , he stood there as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Strang noted , an unkempt mass of thick locks falling over the prominent brow ; his features were good but coarsened , the skin ruddy with health under the layer of grime , the mouth was large , the lips heavy andp325slack . Now Levadi seemed to remember the stranger again , and his head swung around quickly , the eyes wary and suspicious . Levadi spoke . It was a rough , shy voice , strangely thin , highpitched . " You are here . " I certainly am , thought Strang . Or was that remark Levadi 's idea of a question ? " I want to talk to you . " Levadi 's frown deepened . " You stop me , I kill you , " he said . He stared at Strang 's hands , still buried in his pockets . " I came to talk . " Strang took his hands out of his pockets . " I have no weapon , " he assured the man . But that was a miscalculation . Levadi turned and walked uphill , with a long striding step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wait ! " Strang started after him . Levadi whirled around , the long stick grasped in both hands , ready to hit , if necessary . Strang halted . " Where are you going ? " The man stared at him . " Home , " he said slowly . And where was home  --  a hut on this mountainside , or the ruins , far on the crest of a hill , of the Frankish castle ? Then Strang made a bold guess . " This is not the way to Parnassos . " The man looked at him . " I know the way . " " But you can not go back . " " Now  --  yes . " Levadi smiled , the lips drawn slowly back into a wide , loose grimace . " And Myrrha  --  " The grimace on the wide mouth turned from delight to pain . It was , thought Strang , very much like talking to a large powerfuldog who might understand a few key words but mistrusted everything else . Strang said very clearly , " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild eyes , staring at the American . I 've seen that face , Strang thought ; somewhere , I 've seen that face . He repeated slowly , " They tried to kill Myrrha . " " No . Not Myrrha . Stefanos , yes . He is a deserter . He betrayed  --  " " That 's a lie . He did not desert to any Germans . Sideros told you a lie . Odysseus told you a lie . " Levadi 's reply to that was to raise his stick and take a step toward Strang . " Come back to the house , " Strang said . " See what they have done . The dog had its throat slit . Myrrha may be dead . You heard the  --  " And what was the Greek word for grenades ?  | " Not Myrrha . " " They lied . " Levadi leaped forward in anger , in a quick bounding run , the stick upraised and ready to strike . Strang jumped aside . And from behind him , the sharp crack of a rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the stick as he spun around with a cry , and fell , clutching his shoulder . He tried to rise and run . " Stop , or I 'll kill you this time , " Petros yelled , clambering over the stone wall . John was following him . Levadi stopped . Strang looked at him in amazement : he had stopped , had taken two paces back . To be killed  --  was that what he feared most ? What made a man like that even want to live ? Strang watched Levadi and wondered . The man had stopped again ; he was looking across the black stretch of valley to its western wall of mountains . The snow-wrapped peaks were ablaze with colors , no longer hinted but as vivid as the fires of an opal : purple , pink , mauve , magenta , rose . The mists had drawn into soft white masses of cloud edged with a golden light . The colors shifted , deepened , mixed , paled . And then , in a moment , they were gone . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to them , biting his lip , struggling with his emotion . " Tears for a sunrise ! And he would have beaten out your brains on these rocks just as easily as he welcomed a dog and slit its throat . He would let a man be murdered in his bed and a woman be blown to pieces . " Petros 's lip curled with contempt . He raised his rifle . " No ! " Strang said sharply . " Get him down to the house ! " He looked away from Levadi . The man 's emotion was too painful to watch . Levadi stumbled past him , his left hand resting on top of his head in surrender , his right arm half raised in pain . And at that moment , Strang remembered the photograph : the surrender on the slope of Parnassos ; the man whose blind instinct to live separatedhim from those he left to die , the shepherd who wept tears of shame and followed Odysseus into the enemy camp . Elias , his hair ruffled in the wind , his thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low stone wall . " Who 's this ? ' he asked . " The fourth man , " John told him , his sharp eyes watching Levadi'severy movement , his rifle ready . " The shepherd , " Strang said , and Elias looked at him sharply , then back at the man slipping and stumbling toward him . Nowp327Elias was studying the face coming toward him . " Yes , " he said coldly , " the shepherd from Mount Parnassos . " Levadi climbed over the wall and stopped as he saw a group of men waiting down at the bottom of the field near the house . Elias told Petros and John , " See that nothing happens to him ! " " What ? We protect him ? " asked Petros . " We need him alive . " In English , Elias said to Strang , " If he will talk , that is to say . " He shrugged his shoulders . " Can he talk ? " " He is n't an idiot . Ask him why he once rebelled against Odys-seus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into step beside Levadi and began talking to the man . Halfway down the field , Elias waited for Strang to catch up . " It was a personal matter . Something about Elektra . " " Tell him Odysseus has killed Elektra . " Elias stared in horror . " Certainly not ! Do n't even say that to anyone . Not yet ! I forbid you ! " " All right , all right , " Strang said , and fell back to join Petros . " It is enough to show him what Odysseus ordered to be done here , " Elias said gruffly , and hurried Levadi on toward the house . " Who are the men ? " Strang asked Petros , watching the tight group that waited at the bottom of the field . Their weapons , he saw , were axes . " From the village . You saw them rush across the stream when the captain blew his little whistle . " Petros was delighted with the look of surprise on Strang 's face . " What did you think I was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waken my friends . We needed them , did n't we ? " " And Elias brought back no reinforcements ? " " Sure . They are on their way . " Petros 's smile broadened . " Arrivingany moment . " Strang looked at the row of quiet little houses , and apologized to them . " When I climbed this field , I wondered why they lay so still . " " When you climbed this field , how were you so sure that I would follow you ? " " Because , " Strang said , " you were n't going to let me escape  --  if that was what I had been doing . " Petros rubbed the scar on his brow , looked sideways at the American , and laughed softly . " There could have been a fifth man , " he said , threw an arm across Strang 's back and matched his step . Hep328was still smiling broadly as they reached the group of embattled villagers around Elias and his prisoner . Strang left Petros explainingthat the captain must know what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed at the back of the Kiadas house . He skirted two bodies , stretched just outside the door . In the shed , where the animals had been sheltered at night , he halted . The place was a shambles , its roof torn wide by a grenade . The donkey had been put out of its misery ; one goat was dead , the other would soon be . He plowed through a mass of mangled chickens to the small door that connected the shed to the house . It had been weakened by the explosion , a panel smashed to let another grenade be thrown into the downstairs room . The fireplace wall was a ruin , the rest of the place a desolate mess of fragments and dust . The wooden staircase still hugged the far wall , and there , on one of the broken treads of the lower steps , Myrrha Kladas was sitting , staring at nothing , while three women tried to comfort her . Her small face , streaked with dust , looked smaller under the bandage tied roughly around her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the tears were streaming down her face leaving furrows of grime . " Myrrha ! " Her eyes turned to him in deep despair . " They killed my animals , " she said . " They killed  --  " " Steve ? Where is Steve ? " She pointed to the front door , wide open , the gray light of early morning stealing across its threshold . And there , at last , was Steve . He was huddled in a gray blanket , his feet bandaged , hobbling into the back seat of the Chrysler . Costas was already at the wheel . Behind the Chrysler was an army car , and then an open truck with a platoon of fresh-faced boys in uniform now filing out into the village street . Elias and his prisoner , still intact , were standing by the army car while Elias explained vehemently to the lieutenant in command . Strang went forward to the Chrysler , and leaned on its back door . " Hi there ! " he said . There really did n't seem much more to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve tried to smile , but the usual furrows would n't deepen round his mouth . He put out his hand and gripped Strang 's . Costas said , " He is going to Athens . Urgent business . " I can believe that , Strang thought . " But is he fit enough to travel ? " Steve said , " I am going . Ken  --  I 've got to go . "  | " Fine . Just hand me that coat on the back seat , and you can stretch out there . I 'll ride beside Costas . " Strang put on his coat thankfully and turned up its collar . " Perishing cold by the dawn 's early light , " he said . " Ken  --  will you do something for me ? " Strang waited . He could almost feel what was coming . " Stay with Myrrha . Until I get back . " " I promised to be back in Athens by  --  " Strang began , and then stopped . " We must leave , " Costas broke in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a day , at least . Just keep an eye on things , Ken . Will you ? " Strang nodded , stepped back from the car , smiled to get that anxious look out of Steve 's face . " All right , " he said , and waved . Costas turned the car with an expert flourish , the eyes of the village upon him , saluted Elias as he passed and roared along the straight street in a cloud of dust . Strang stood there , watching them go . He felt so tired , so agonizingly tired and depressed that he could n't even make up his mind to start walking back to the house . Elias came over to him . " I am taking Levadi to Athens . There will be trouble if we keep him around here . Besides  --  he may decide to talk . He might be very useful . " " When he saw the house , and Myrrha  --  what did he say ? " Elias shrugged . " He was sorry . He was very sorry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Elektra seems to upset him a great deal . Very strange . I do not suppose she even noticed him . " " Nor did the sunrise , " Strang said . He added briskly , " Good luck , Elias ! And do n't leave me stranded here . " " Certainly not . I shall send a car for you , at the earliest , tomorrow . " Elias shook hands very formally , and hurried back to the army car . He had commandeered a driver and an extra man from the lieutenant , too . He saluted as he got in beside Levadi . That 's going to be one hell of a journey , Strang thought , as he watched another cloud of dust . He buttoned his coat to his chin . Petros was beside him . " We 'll find you a place to sleep . I have a cousin , a widower , no women to start lamenting . Some food and some sleep . Right ? " It sounded pretty wonderful . " I 'll see Myrrha first , " Strang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sleep . He looked at the sky to
