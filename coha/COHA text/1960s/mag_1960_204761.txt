Jack Kennedy had figured the West Virginia odds at 60-40-against himself . His odds were right ; he had just predicted the wrong winner . When the final returns were in , he had swept West Virginia by 220,000 votes to Hubert Humphrey 's 142,000 . <P> It was a triumph that confounded the experts . Kennedy had carried all but seven of West Virginia 's 55 counties . Despite the pressure of venerable United Mine Worker John L. Lewis for Humphrey , the miners in the depressed coal fields turned out for Kennedy . Despite the warnings of their militantly Protestant pastors , the hillbillies south of the Kanawha River voted for a Catholic ; Kennedy , in fact , brought his campaign to a climax with a statewide Sunday evening television assurance that if any President of the U.S. took " dictation " from anyone , the Pope included , it would be contrary to his oath of office and " he would be subject to impeachment and should be . " Negroes gave him their emphatic endorsement . Women found him irresistible . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia primary cleared the political air . It swept the religious issue aside , at least until after the Democratic Convention , and it removed any doubt about Kennedy 's ability as a vote getter . <P> Razzle-Dazzle . Reporters , pollsters and politicos who had predicted a narrow Humphrey victory ( although most had hedged their bets in the last days by noting a Kennedy campaign surge ) cast about for explanations . There were several in sight . The smooth , battle-proven Kennedy organization had never worked more efficiently . Most West Virginians thought that the Kennedy moneybags had been used not to buy the election ( " We 're running for President , not for sheriff , " snorted a Kennedy aide ) but to finance a razzle-dazzle , all-out fight . In the last 72 hours Kennedy poured out $40,000 for radio and television time . Then there were such shrewdly employed pitchmen as Franklin Roosevelt Jr. , who exploited New Deal nostalgia to good effect . <P> Negative factors worked for Jack Kennedy , too . Humphrey drew good crowds and held them like an evangelist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was a serious presidential candidate . His silent partnership with Candidates Stuart Symington and Lyndon Johnson did him no good , and the pro-Humphrey campaign of West Virginia 's Senator Robert Byrd , an avowed Johnson man , boomeranged savagely . Kennedy even carried Byrd 's home town , Sophia , 237-135 . As a former Ku Klux Klansman , Byrd probably accounted for a large part of Kennedy 's big Negro vote . <P> On the Line . The biggest factor was Jack Kennedy himself . His easy manner , serious speeches and kinetic charm , his decision to fight out the religion issue , and even his Harvard accent-all won respect and votes .
