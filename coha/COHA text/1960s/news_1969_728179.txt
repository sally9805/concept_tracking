txt Nixon 's Viet policy is the same . . . . . . and war critics unleash a torrent I have chosen a plan for peace . I believe it will succeed . ' U.S. Vietnam withdrawal : ' Yes ' when ? The policy for Vietnam is the same , but the presidential voice is entirely different . " I have chosen ! " said President Nixon to the American people . Four times in his speech he repeated different forms of that simple declarative statement . The President of the United States has served notice that he has taken full command , that he will make peace according to his particular plan for " defending the self-determination of South Vietnam " regardless of what anyone in the United States or Hanoi does or says . This was the dominant message of his speech , rather than any change of direction or tempo in the peacemaking . The President made it plain that he has the power in this matter and intends to use it . He believes he has a current of growing approval running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American public and he expects to strengthen it . He knows that his sharpest critics , particularly in Congress , are on the brink of unleashing a torrent of opposition . That torrent was hushed , temporarily , when the President announced his speech , to wait and see what Mr. Nixon would say . So the President responded with an exercise of presidential decision and leadership . He met his opposition head on and plans to overwhelm it . Now the national debate over the speed and purpose of withdrawal from Vietnam has really begun . The President defined " my plan " more clearly and succinctly than at anytime in the past : " . . . Persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiated settlement , if possible , or through continued Vietnamization if necessary  --  a plan in which we will withdraw all our forces from Vietnam on a schedule . . . as the South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom . " Vietnamization challenged The last phrase had the bite : withdrawal as fast as South Vietnam " becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out , this meant withdrawal as slowly as necessary to keep the Saigon government in power . As this is written it is too early to appraise the extent and the quality of the opposition case in the wake of the President 's speech . But former Ambassador W. Averell Harriman led off with a flat statement that he did n't think the Vietnamization process could be carried out as long as the present unpopular military regime controls the Saigon government . Therefore , Mr. Harriman indicated , under the President 's plan which requires successful Vietnamization , American troops would have to remain in Vietnam indefinitely because the plan would n't work . After defining his plan , the President lowered the boom . " I have chosen " that plan , he said . " .. . I recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan I have chosen ... but as President of the United States I would be untrue to my oath of office if I allowed the policy of this nation to be dictated by the minority .. . who attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . " Again : " I have chosen a plan for peace . I believe it will succeed . If it does succeed , what the critics say now will not matter . If it does not succeed , anything I say then will not matter . " And again : " As President I hold the responsibility for choosing the best path to that goal of " ending the war in a way that we could win the peace " , and then for leading our nation along it . " // *Viet withdrawal : ' Yes ' when ? // Of his plan , the President said emphatically , " It is the right way . " This kind of phrase  --  the " right way " or " we know it is right " ? recurred through the remarks of both the President and the " White House source " who analyzed it . The President several times claimed credit on behalf of himself and his administration for " initiating " or " launching " the Vietnamization program which was first adopted on a high level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted by Mr. Johnson . 0 In ? general Mr. Nixon 's explanation of the " rationale " for not accepting defeat in Vietnam was so orthodox that it might have been written by former Secretary of State Dean Rusk . Mr. Nixon quoted President Kennedy as saying , " We want to see a stable government there carrying on the struggle to maintain its national independence . . . . We 're not going to withdraw from that effort . In my opinion for us to withdraw .. . would mean a collapse not only of South Vietnam but Southeast Asia , so we 're going to stay there . " The President added that the same conclusion had been expressed by Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson . He then added his own approval and then the snapper to his argument : " We have noted the reduced level of infiltration and the reduction of our casualties and are basing our withdrawal partially on those factors . " " If the level of infiltration or our casualties increase while we are trying to scale down the fighting , " Mr. Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious decision by the enemy . " and then : " Hanoi could make no greater mistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to its own advantage . If I conclude that increased enemy action jeopardizes our remaining forces in Vietnam , I shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation . This is not a threat . This is a statement of policy . . . " This statement , similar to many such by President Johnson , will doubtless be one of the focal points of the coming debate . Public opinion gauged The Nixon speech was made just a week after a Harris poll , taken under the sponsorship of Time magazine , said that " half of the general public would be willing to back Nixon in one last attempt to escalate and win . " The poll report also said : " It is remarkable how much support remains for the policy of ending the war in honorable fashion , short of complete abandonment of South Vietnam . . . Nixon has managed to win broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? withdrawal of American troops pegged to Vietnamization of the war ( 61 percent ) , and holding out for the right of South Vietnamese self-determination ( a majority ) . " Fully three-quarters of the public polled favor the President 's program on troop withdrawals . Half do not want to see the U.S. cut and run , ' and more than half believe the pace of troops withdrawals is about right or too fast . " The Nixon speech , and the reasoning behind it , were no doubt based on a wide range of factors , but the Harris poll fitted like  --  a tight glove . The speech was accepted in Washington as an exercise in the American domestic politics of . the Vietnam war . The President has cast his die on the basis of the situation presented by the Harris poll .
