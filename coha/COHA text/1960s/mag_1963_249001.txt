One of the Tanganyikan delegates to the U.N . was duly exercised . The U.S. , he said , was plotting with South Africa to test atom bombs . He had read all about it in the newspapers . <P> Whatever he had read , Khari R. Baghdelleh had obviously not understood it . And no reasonable man would suspect the U.S. of joining South Africa in any international hanky-panky . Still , rumors about atomic weaponry have a habit of swelling rapidly into dangerous controversies . U.S. Representative to the U.N . Adlai Stevenson wasted no time in pointing out that the only scientific experiment now scheduled to involve both the U.S. and South Africa has nothing to do with bombs : it will be a delicate and determined effort to detect some elusive particles of matter . <P> Rare Events . The experiment will generate no atomic blast , but if it pays off it may have an explosive impact on the new and booming subscience of neutrino physics . Neutrinos are littleknown particles that have no mass of their own and no electric charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all with known kinds of matter . They are generated copiously in the centers of stars , and they move with the speed of light as they slip out into space and pass right through any stars they happen to hit . It has been calculated that a stream of neutrinos could pass through 10 billion earths without being absorbed . <P> This elusiveness makes neutrinos hard to deal with . Though scientists have been convinced that the particles exist , they were not directly detected until 1956 when Physicists Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan Jr. , of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , set up a monstrous apparatus near the Atomic Energy Commission 's Savannah River reactor , which looses vast floods of neutrinos . A few times each hour while the reactor was working , the detector registered an " event . " This meant that a single neutrino , out of many billions of billions per second , had actually hit something . <P> Now there are newer and better detection systems , but neutrinos are still fantastically hard to catch . Dr. Reines , who landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African work . The site was chosen because a deep mine was needed to screen out cosmic rays , which would interfere with the experiment . India has such a mine , but the Indians wanted to boss the experiment themselves . Reines turned to South Africa where the University of the Witwatersrand offered him an unusual laboratory : a gold mine near Johannesburg shielded by 10,492 ft. of solid rock . <P> In this snug foxhole , Reines will assemble a vast neutrino trap , designed at Cleveland 's Case Institute . Even the most powerful cosmic rays do not penetrate to the depth of the gold mine , but the entire universe is believed to be swarming with neutrinos that will be deterred not at all by two miles of rock . Some of them are believed to carry unusual amounts of energy , and these fat neutrinos should be easier to detect than leaner ones . <P> Ashes of Creation . Part of the Reines apparatus will lie in wait for fat neutrinos . Another part will have several hundred square yards of scintillation counters to watch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding the mine . On the earth 's surface these neutrino-induced mu-mesons are almost impossible to identify because of confusion caused by cosmic rays .
