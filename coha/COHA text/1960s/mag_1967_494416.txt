36 Children is a simple and direct nar ? rative of Mr. Kohl 's experiences with a sixth grade class in a Harlem school , and it is one of the best books by a teacher I 've read . It gives an honest and illuminating description of how a teacher works , and it explores the proc ? ess of change he has to undergo as he and his children respond to each other and he begins to gather his nerve to alter his way of teaching . He shows , for example , the complicated private war he waged with himself over the matter of discipline . The class was the top sixth grade class in the school , but only five or six out of the 36 children could read a sixth grade book , and more than half were reading at fourth grade level . As an inexperienced teacher , he stuck to the assigned texts , and tried hard to maintain a strict schedule , with separate periods for different subjects . Looking back , he suggests that this tightness with time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be learned in a school year , or the amount of ground the class had to cover , for the truth was that the chil ? dren had learned very little anyway after five full years of school . It stemmed , he admits , from his own fear of loss of control . Gradually building up his own confidence he made his own accommodation to discipline , and so did the children . He tells how he started let ? ting them take 10-minute breaks be ? tween subjects , when they could play the piano , read books , and play chess and checkers . At the end of the second day 's break , the class resisted going back to work , but he insisted , and be lieves that a failure at this point would have been disastrous , because the chil ? dren had made a bargain and had to keep it . ( Perhaps it was important for him to know that the class could keep bargains . ) Things worked out , painfully : " I remember days getting home from school angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my ranting and carping , my inability to let the children alone . I kept saying ' That 's not me , that 's not me ' . For a while , as I learned to teach , the me in the classroom was an alien and hostile being . " He overcame his conviction that if one child got out of control the whole class would follow and chaos would result : " I let an insult pass and discovered that the rest of the class did n't take up the insult ; I learned to say noth ? ing when Ralph returned from pac ? ing the halls or when Alvin refused to do arithmetic . The children did not want to be defiant , insulting , idle ; nor were they any less afraid of chaos than I was . " He never completely solved the prob ? lem of discipline . He never was able to line everybody up at 3 o'clock . Sadly , he reports that one boy he could n't reach left the class . He and the other children learned to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to solving the discipline problem . There are many profound reflections on teaching scattered through 36 Chil ? dren , but one small and almost periph ? eral illustration of Mr. Kohl 's aware ? ness of the complexities will have to suffice . This concerns a teacher 's need for privacy , a separate existence out ? side the classroom , even sometimes , for a year or two away from teaching . Atone point he began having children over to his apartment after school . ( To some teachers and administrators this is the same thing as deserting the trenches to fraternize with the enemy in no-man's-land . ) The visits were a suc ? cess , but he found , finally , that he had to restrict them to just one day in the week . The children were angry when he told them he needed his own life . I 've met good teachers who never ap ? preciated this , or if they did , were un ? able to do anything about it . They never set apart any aspect of them ? selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sensed that somehow in the long process they were being scooped hollow . In the end they were left trying to live vicariously through the children , which was not enough . So much for the complexities , which fill Mr. Kohl 's account . 36 Children is an important book because it shows how a teacher abandoned the usual classroom methods and developed an informal class where children could work on their own , where they were offered choices about what to do , and where in fact they generated a good deal of the curriculum themselves , in ? cluding an extraordinary outpouring of free writing . It reports all this con ? vincingly , with the kind of specific de ? tail necessary for understanding and yet so often absent from discussions of teaching . He includes many samples of the children 's work , so that 36 Children becomes , in parts , an eloquent anthol ? ogy testifying to the creative energy of these Harlem students . He shows us their poems , myths , sly fables , comic strips , autobiographies , essays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , and his pamphlet , Teaching the Unteachable , provide American teachers , parents , and the public with the kind of thing they des ? perately lack : concrete examples of what a really good job of teaching might look like . There is a big differ ? ence between a class in which the teacher simply likes the children , and a class where the children are stimu lated to do first-rate work . 36 Children sheds some light on the difference . Its lessons apply to suburbs , as well as slums , for very few schools of any sort in this country regularly permit chil ? dren to choose the content of their writ ? ing , and children 's literature is rarely read with the respect and attention it needs in order to flourish . Mr. Kohl claims no great originality for his dis ? covery that children can write . Other teachers have discovered the same thing . People learn to use words ? to want to use words well ? by trying to get across something they want to say to an audi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to write by writing . ( But it is true , as he says , that children will not write if they are afraid to talk . ) His example is relevant to every level of education , from first grade through graduate school , but of course it hits with all the more force because his class was composed of black and Puerto Rican children , who , we are so often told , lack any vocabulary , are unable to handle abstractions , learn mainly from physical , rather than mental , activity , and so on and so on . In fact his chil ? dren liked to write and had a lot to say . Not all were gifted writers , though some clearly were , and many , like many adults , had only a single important story to tell , to write and rewrite . Yet , " all of them . . . seemed to become more alive through their writing . " In making the change from a formal class to a freer one , he was driven by desperation , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For six or seven weeks he struggled with the assigned books , but it was hopeless . He was bored and so were the children . A few times the class came to life : they had an intricate discussion of the Patterson-Liston fight , and a conversation about the word " psyche " that led the aston ? ished children to consider the idea that language and words changed over time , had a history . " You mean words change ? " " You mean one day the way we talk ? you know , with words like cool and dig and soul ? may be all right ? " They were facinated by the myth of Cupid and Psyche , and be ? came hungry for words and myths . He dropped the dreary social studies texts ( How We Became Modern America ) and started teaching them about words , myths , and periods of history that in ? terested him . Social studies became a free period , a long break in which the teacher overwhelmed the class with books and projects , and let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports to file , or set numbers of pages to read . There were books on archi ? tecture , the Greeks , mythology , Meso ? potamia , early man , books on World War II for a set of war buffs , art books for a boy who drew all the time , the Bobbsey Twins , and novels like Doro ? thy Sterling 's Mary Jane , the story of a Negro girl who integrates a white school . As they began making choices , the teacher found that he could take the time to watch and listen and get some idea of what intrigued them . A few boys got interested in science , and they told him of an unused cache of science equipment somewhere in the school . Others knew where they could lay hands on a record player . He brought in his records and the class introduced him to Moms Mabley . By the end of October , they were telling him about the neighborhood , and then they began to write about it . The papers were n't marked , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably the first time they had ever written to say something that mattered : " I live 62 E. 120St My neighborhood is not so bad . Everyone has children in the block . Many of the children are Spanish . Some of them run around nude and dirty . Some of the houses are so dirty you would be sacre to come in the door . Some ? times the drunks come out and fight . . . . Many of the people in the block drink so much they do n't have time for the children . The children have no place to play they have the park but the parents do n't care enough to take them . Now you have a idea of what my block is like . " He found himself running a very different kind of class from the one he had begun with . The free social studies period expanded to a free day . Each morning he put an assignment on the board and the class had a choice of reading and writing or else doing the assignment . Writing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? lic , and the children were encouraged to work at one task until the mo ? mentum was lost . Some were upset by the absence of routine , and missed the comfort of doing things by rote . Their teacher often wavered , too , and thought about going back to formal teaching . The slow result was a flowering of free writing . The first book he was allowed to see was an autobiography by Maurice , years old : " This story is about a boy named Maurice and his life as it is and how it will be . Maurice is in the six grade now , but this story will tell you about his past , present , and future . . When I was born I could n't see at first , but like alI fami ? lies my father was waiting outside after a hour or so I could see shadows . . . . Robert Jackson , the artist , began an astonishing literary output with a book clearly influenced by his readings about Greece .

He was named after this Latin word because he had sensitive feelings . In Ancient Germany the Romans had their vast empire . . . " The teacher found that different chil ? dren respond to different kinds of writ ? ing , trying out new voices and modes . After hearing fables from Aesop and Thurber , some took to the fable : " Once upon a time there was a pig and a cat . The cat kept saying you old dirty pig who want to eat you . And the pig replied when I die I 'll be made use of , but when you die you 'll just rot . The cat always thought he was better than the pig . When the pig died he was used as food for the people to eat . When the cat died he was buried in old dirt . Moral : Live dirty die clean . " Some children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super ? man and Wonder Woman . The most impressive ? " awesome , " is , quite prop ? erly , the word his teacher uses is a long unfinished fragment of the Elektra myth by Alvin Curry , Jr. , which begins : " This story called Elektra is of the deepest passion and the deepest hope of avengeance of her father 's death . . . " The children produced a maga ? zine , And , the two issues of which ap ? pear in 36 Children . And has many fine things , including illustrated my ? thologies by Robert Jackson , and Marie Ford 's poem , " The Junkies " : The school 's authorities , who in most respects seem to have left Mr. Kohl to his own devices , thought that And con ? tained too much terror and violence , and recommended that the class study a fifth grader 's sticky little poem on shopping with Mom . The assistant principal 's only reaction to And was an offer to give its creators a lesson in proofreading . Mr. Kohl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the portrait emerges slowly , and it is done with justice and a certain amount of pity , as well as rage . For instance , " It was difficult not to feel the general chaos to observe the classes without teachers , the children wandering aim ? lessly , sometimes wantonly through the halls , disrupting classes , intimidating , extorting , yet being courted by the ad ? ministration : ' Please do n't make trou ble , anything you want , but no trou ? ble ' . " In April , he demonstrated what he thought of the system by doing something that radically contradicted its premises , something that many teach ? ers in slum schools would regard as un ? professional . ( If teachers really were professionals , of course , they would be loyal to their immediate students and not to their superiors or the school sys ? tem . ) He explained to his children that they were going to have to take reading and ( at that time in New York ) IQ tests which determined placement in junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their records and told them their past scores . They were angry and shocked , for no one in all their years in school had ever told them frankly how low they stood . In this , the top sixth grade class in the school , only two children had IQ scores above zoo ; the majority had scores in the 8o to go range . The class asked what could be done , and he did what teachers of middle-class children often do and teachers of slum children al ? most never do : he taught them how to take tests . ( As he explains , many teach ? ers in slum schools feel that their own failures with the children are excused if objective tests can establish that the children are failures . ) He got old tests and drilled the class for several weeks in the tricky art of following instruc ? tions . The children objected to the bor ? ing drill , but he made them be realistic . Their superb sixth grade work did n't matter ; they would go nowhere in junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught them the different kinds of test questions and got them to see that they must n't be too clever and outsmart tests . Children sometimes have trouble learning that a test has only one right answer , and that the task is to figure out what the man who made the test expects and not simply what seems like a reasonable answer . They have to be trained to think on the test 's level , not on their level . The children learned . As their teacher put it , " they agreed to be dull for the sake of their future . " There was too little time to prepare for the IQ tests , and only zo in the class scored over zoo , one girl getting 135 . But the reading tests later on in the year showed the results of deter ? mined coaching . Most of the class jumped one to three years , a few were at a fifth grade level , 12 were on the seventh grade level , and eight read on levels between eighth and twelfth grades . The reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most certainly a victory for Mr. Kohl and his children . He had n't created the visionary social studies course he once imagined teach ? ing , which would instruct children " to be able to persist , revolt , and change things in our society and yet not lose their souls in the process . " But he had done wonderful things . The children had learned to read widely and to like reading , and they had discovered that they could write ? to touch on the more obvious and perhaps less important as ? pects of their encounter with a gifted and warm teacher . The first and long ? est section of 36 Children is written in a tone of quiet pride . This , it seems to say , is how it 's done . This is being a successful teacher . A short second section makes 36 Chil ? dren a tragic book , as well as the story of a success . It follows the careers of the children in the years after leaving sixth grade in 1963 . While the returns are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one child 's mournful observation , " Mr. Kohl , one good year is n't enough . " Despite the children 's tenacious desire to finish school , and the foolish hopes and dreams that kept them going long after the pointlessness of school was evident , they began coming back , bewildered , to their sixth grade teacher to report discouragement and steady demoraliza ? tion . One girl made it to a prep school in New England , paying a heavy psy ? chic price for making it in the white world . A handful of other girls en ? dured , because they were strong . The attrition rate among the boys was sick ? ening . Robert Jackson , whose drawings and writings adorn 36 Children , quit the High School of Music and Art . ( When Mr. Kohl went to discover why , he met a guidance counselor whose office was full of black students . " You know we 're very good to here , " she whispered , writing the word " Ne ? groes " on a pad . ) Michael , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Psyche , still dreamed of becoming a writer . He wanted to mas ? ter the craft , but school was irrelevant , and he was selling newspapers for a living . Another boy , Ralph , was " be ? ginning to look like those permanent dwellers in junkies ' paradise . " In a series of letters and writings to his teacher , Alvin Curry records the down ? ward path to wisdom . Subsequent teachers have treated him as an illiter ? ate , and yet gloomily he continues to write . This is from " The Condemned Building : " " There is a leaky faucet , going with a steady drip of water , there is no recreation whatsoever where a per ? son can spend his leisure time , but there is something to look at , the walls which have plaster peeling , which suggests different moods that a person may be in , the walls are so arranged that they suggest differ ? ent scenes Iike maybe a scene of you gradually graduating from boyhood to man when the mirage has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black suggesting for you maybe a private hell where you can satisfy your own desires , . . you step into the outside where you ask yourself why is this building con ? demned , where a person can find his inner self .

His answer is trou ? bled . He will not teach again in the public school system as it stands . He hopes he can find a way to continue teaching children , but it is clear that he will be less certain that he can save them next time . What he will be able to do , at least , is add his weight to " easing the burden of being alive in the United States today . " 36 Children presents an aspect of the social tragedy now engulfing this coun ? try , but it is much more than simply another book with the same message we have heard and ignored often be ? fore .
