txt Virginia 's Governor is telling Old Dominion localities that while the state fills their education tills from the top they must n't drill holes in the bottom . A new 2 percent sales tax will start in September pouring some $80 million a year into local school budgets . So some local school officials in the state are talking about cutting their local property taxes . That 's just what Gov . Mills E. Godwin Jr . insists they must n't do . The sales-tax cash , he says , is an addition , not a replacement . The state has even granted localities power to enact their own 1 percent sales tax just to make sure they keep up their end of things . Governor Godwin thinks cutting local input into the education till would defeat the whole idea of the sales tax . He has marshaled his prestige to prevent it . Since it is now local budgetmaking time in Virginia , the Governor is expected to stand anxious watch until almost all have been passed . Florida 's tourist cup is spilling over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter season just ended . And the tide shows no sign now of ebbing .. All transportation agencies serving the state say reservations for the summer ahead stand at record highs . Some agencies are maintaining winter schedules or even adding to them . Motel construction is booming . A Jacksonville firm recently announced plans to build 14 new motels and lease them to the StatlerHilton chain . The State Development Commission now estimates Florida will be teeming with 17 million tourists a year by 1970 . That 's nearly three times the resident population . Miami Beach is about to dab on the perfume and smooth out its dress and smile coyly at the politicians . The city hopes to land one or both national political conventions in 1968  --  and is already at work on it . A plan to double the size of the city 's convention hall is being hammered out now and a statewide committee will start soon raising funds to outbid other cities . Mayor Elliott Roosevelt , who is also Florida 's Democratic national committeeman , is spearheading the bid . He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians : Florida , ninth-ranked in the electoral vote column , will be a key battleground in the 1968 race . And the party that holds its convention there may get the running start . Trends .. . Mississippi 's Freedom Democratic Party is gearing for another charge up a seemingly insurmountable political hill . The party first cropped up in national headlines when it tried , without success , to stop the seating of the Mississippi delegation to the Democratic National Convention . After the 1964 election it tried , again without success , to challenge the seating of five Democratic congressmen from Mississippi . In the teeth of constant harassment , the party is now trying to enter a slate of five candidates in congressional races this fall . The outlook is dim . Recent redistricting disadvantageous to Negroes has further pared the chances , which were none too bright to start with . Federal registrars have registered several thousand Negro voters in Mississippi , but the state Attorney General has refused to enter their names on the voting lists . The Mississippi Secretary of State has accepted entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet said whether their names will be on the ballot . The president of the newest chapter of the Junior Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas is a prison inmate convicted of pushing dope . And a lot depends on him . The Jaycee chapter he heads is the first ever organized in a federal prison . If the experiment works , it may spread to federal penitentiaries around the country . The project was pushed by the Texarkana Jaycees , led by a young lawyer named Edwin M. Prud'homme . There have been Jaycee chapters in county and state prisons before . But most have n't lasted long . This first one in a federal prison in Texarkana is off to a good start . Its president is dynamic . And since its national charter was granted April 1 , membership has jumped from 40 to 50 inmates . It has met weekly , formed an inmate band , organized a softball team , put a handicraft concession in the visitor 's lobby , and donated 170 pints of blood to Vietnam . In a few weeks , some trusted inmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond in the local zoo . Now Mr. Prud'homme has just been to Michigan to explain the Texarkana program at a federal prison in Milan . The idea is already beginning to spread .
