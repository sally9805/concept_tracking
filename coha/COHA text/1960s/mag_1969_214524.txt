THERE is a train track in the history of art that goes way back to Mesopotamia , " Willem de Kooning once noted , with an artist 's lordly disregard for details of engineering . " Duchamp is on it . Czanne is on it . " An imposing retrospective of his work , opening at the Museum of Modern Art this week , demonstrates that De Kooning , still hale and heartily turning out landscapes at 64 , has already established his place along that main line . <P> Conspicuous in the show are 13 examples of his Women of 1950-55 . These " bitch goddesses " outraged yet captivated the public taste at the time , perhaps because they were essentially familiar , looking nostalgically backward to Picasso 's baleful demoiselles and George Grosz 's Weimar whores . But looking backward in turn , most critics now find far more significant the abstract compositions that De Kooning executed between 1945 and 1950 , before he immortalized his Women . <P> In the late 1940s , the Abstract Expressionists were admired by only a few hardy critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every museum and collector in the country . With his fellows , De Kooning hung out in grimy Greenwich Village cafeterias , endlessly debating the new esthetic and just as endlessly revising the canvases in his studio . De Kooning sought to capture on canvas the continuing essence of the creative act of painting itself . To do this , he jettisoned polished finish in favor of apparently raw brush strokes , which in reality were painstakingly executed and frequently reworked . On another level , he strove to transmute biomorphic forms into a single unending composition . <P> He succeeded most magnificently in Excavation , a strangely tawdry yet luminous 6-ft. by 8-ft. canvas completed at the culmination of the cycle in 1950 . Why it is called Excavation is a mystery that remains with De Kooning . In fact , it resembles little except perhaps a crackling bonfire , where visions of possible nymphs and improbable satyrs gyre in the obscuring smoke . But it delves profoundly into method , its seething forms eluding both definition and restriction . Exhibited at the Venice Biennale later in 1950 , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to establish Abstract Expressionism as the major art of its time . And it may have marked the occasion when Manhattan displaced Paris as the art capital of the world .
