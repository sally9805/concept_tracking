This was Eddie McCormack 's own bailiwick , and he meant to make the most of it . Plastered with cosmetics for television , he reminded the audience in the South Boston High School auditorium that he had gone to that very school and married a girl from that neighborhood . Then he launched into an attack that for sustained violence was remarkable even in Massachusetts ' butt-and-gouge political history . <P> Standing only a few feet away was McCormack 's rival for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator-Teddy Kennedy , now rigid with shock and suppressed anger . <P> " What are your qualifications ? " cried McCormack , in the opening statement of the TV debate . " You graduated from law school three years ago . You never worked for a living . You have never run or held an elective office . You are running on a slogan-you can do more for Massachusetts . This is the most insulting slogan I have seen in Massachusetts politics because it means vote for this man because he has influence , he has connections , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . " The onslaught continued : " I listened to my opponent the other night , and he said , ' I want to serve because I care . ' You did n't care very much , Ted , when you could have voted between 1953 and 1960 on 16 occasions and you only voted three times . Do you really care about civil rights ? While I was fighting to eliminate the ' black belts ' and the ghettos , you were attending a school that is almost totally segregated , at the University of Virginia . <P> " I say we need a Senator with a conscience-not with connections . We need a Senator with experience-not arrogance .
