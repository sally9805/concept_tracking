Japanese voters last week gave another convincing display of support for the recently ratified Japanese-U.S. security pact . In Saitama prefecture , adjacent to Tokyo , incumbent Liberal Democratic Governor Hiroshi Kurihara rolled over a Socialist opponent who had campaigned loudly against the treaty . Though Socialist leaders poured into the prefecture from nearby Tokyo urging voters to " show your anger over the treaty in the election , " Kurihara ran up 14,897 more votes than he did in 1956 to defeat his Socialist rival 374,598 to 126,134.
