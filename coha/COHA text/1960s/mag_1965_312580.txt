No one looking for a spooky spot to open a nightclub in Paris could do better than the former mortuary chapel of the century-old Protestant American Church , a brick-vaulted cellar with a long flight of stairs leading up to street level . And a nightclub is just what the chapel is , under the Rev. Martin van Buren Sargent , 45 , minister of the American Church for the past two years . But Sargent is more than an avant-garde impresario of coffeehouse Christianity . In the main church , he delivers serious , Bible-based sermons to Sunday throngs , worries deeply about the moral problems facing young Americans in Paris , and , as a pastoral counselor , faces a unique " diversity and abundance of personal dilemmas . " <P> Catacombs 65 . Only 350 people are listed as members of his congregation ; yet thousands of tourists jam the American Church on summer Sundays , and about 3,000 U.S. Parisians attend services at least intermittently . Sargent 's imaginative methods of evangelism have extended the church 's " outreach " to roughly half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodly number of Frenchmen as well . <P> Many evenings there are lines outside his basement nightclub , " Catacombs 65 " ( from the church 's address , 65 Quai d'Orsay ) , waiting to drink coffee or lemonade and hear young singers and musicians . In another adjunct of the church , its 300-seat theater , the professional Paris Theater Workshop-whose advisers include Jean Seberg and William Saroyan-presents Sartre , Beckett and Albee as part of " Open End , " a freewheeling series of dramas , concerts and discussions . <P> Once Sargent invited the editor of Paris ' Communist daily L'Humanit to Catacombs 65 . Two summers ago , he helped Novelist James Baldwin organize a miniature version of Washington 's civil rights march . Currently , the American Church has its own **30;1093;TOOLONG Ahlstrom of Yale Divinity School-who teaches a weekly course to 80 adults of the congregation . Sargent occasionally appears on French television and at ecumenical conferences involving French Protestant and Roman Catholic clergy . He chain-smokes his way through an 18-hour day filled with the normal routine of pastors everywhere-teaching , counseling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Old Ladies &; Unwed Mothers . Son of a New Jersey coal-mine owner , Sargent studied for the Congregational ministry at Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary , where he met and married the artist daughter of Princeton Theologian Paul Scherer , then a Union professor . He served his student pastorship in New York slum parishes , preached to congregations in Illinois , Massachusetts and Maine before applying for the Paris church in 1962 . <P> Sargent has tried to make the American Church a catalytic force in the life of the rebellious young people who arrive every year to mix paints in Montmartre or " study " at the Sorbonne . After sickbed visits to old ladies , Sargent occasionally has to soothe the fears of a girl suddenly facing unwed motherhood . His interest in youth has paid off , both in the number of troubled students who come to him for spiritual help and in the increase in young faces at his services .
