They start arriving on the steep stone steps at an early hour . In wintertime , the motorcycle jackets and minks , chesterfields and children 's snowsuits quilt the entrance . In summer , every shirtsleeve seems to end in an ice cream cone . In any season it is Sunday , and the people wadded up against the doubled Corinthian columns are waiting to get into the most culturally concentrated 20 acres in the U.S.-New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art . <P> Watching the crowds jostling through the Met 's entrance last week , Director James J.

In the decade of Rorimer 's stewardship at the Met , annual attendance has skyrocketed from 2,830,000 to nearly 6,000,000 , rising more rapidly than that of any other major U.S. museum .

He unveiled the U.S. 's largest art reference shelf , the 150,000-volume Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patio ( opposite page ) , whose elegant lintels had lain in the basement since 1945 . This week he will open to the public the Met 's new Far Eastern and Islamic galleries ( color pages , following ) , with great halls of giant buddhas that seem to ring with temple gongs , and a collection of Islamic art without parallel in any of the world 's museums outside of Istanbul 's Topkapi. * <P> All these splendors just gild what was already there . Even within a single gallery , the Met is worth a thousand and one days of exploration . Only the Louvre and Leningrad 's Hermitage , among museums outside of Holland , rival the Met 's Rembrandts . Hanging in honeycomb luminosity are 33 of the Dutch master 's softest illusions , from his early white-ruffed burghers to intense portraits of his mistress Hendlrickje Stoeffels to his jeweled Old Testament parables and his bravura Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer , the costliest work of art ( $2,300,000 ) ever auctioned .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
