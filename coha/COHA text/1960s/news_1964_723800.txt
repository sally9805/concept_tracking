txt State 's Atty . Daniel P. Ward and Police Supt. 0 . W. Wilson announced yesterday that any person attempting to prevent a child from attending school today will be arrested and prosecuted . The announcement highlighted the eve of the second " Freedom day " boycott ordered by leaders of civil rights Organizations in Chicago . " There will be prosecutions by this office , " Ward announced . " I conferred with Supt. Wilson this morning , and he has made plans for the arrest of persons who- would seek to ban , block , or intimidate children from attending school . " Sidesteps Query on Parents When reporters asked whether parents who keep their own youngsters out of class would be arrested , Ward declined to comment , but added , " We certainly are not intending to prosecute the children . " Wilson said that policemen would be assigned to almost all r of the schools that are expected to be affected by the boycott and that task force squads will be on continuous patrol . " If anyone tries to prevent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will be subject to arrest , " Wilson said . Boycott Leaders Go Ahead Boycott leaders , meanwhile , stuck to their contention that the protest demonstration is not illegal and said the warnings by the two officials had not altered their plans . Ward has said that a state law provides penalties up to a $50 fine and 25 days in jail for anyone who unlawfully induces a child to stay away from school . Boycott sponsors claim that this law does not apply until a child has been absent for three days . Expect Over 80,000 Absentees Lawrence Landry , chairman of the boycott committee ; estimated that from 80,000 to 100 , - 000 youngsters will be absent from class , about half the number who joined the first school boycott on Oct. 22 . Because about 50,000 students are absent from school on an average February day , Landry 's estimate would mean that the total number of absentees would range from 130,000 to 170,000 . On Oct. 23 , absentees totaled 224,770 out of a total enrollment of about 470,000 students . School officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.50 per pupil per day , and that the aid money is based on average daily attendance . This is a figure arrived at by dividing the total number of student-days during the year by the number of school ' days . A school boycott would have the effect of reducing slightly the average daily attendance . Plan to Picket 12 schools Landry also announced plans to picket 12 schools thruout the day , and to picket City hall late this afternoon . He said there might be 1,500 pickets at City hall " if it is a nice day . " Landry said the schools to be picketed are : Jenner , 1009 Cleveland ay. ; Schiller , 640 Scott st. ; Cooley Vocational High , 1225 Hill st. ; Newton , 901 E. 133d pl. ; Aldridge , 630 E. 131st st. ; Carver High , 801 E. 133d  |p1.  ; Carver elementary , 909 E. 132d st. ; Yale , 7025 . Princeton ay. ; Harvard , 7525 Harvard ay. ; Guggenheim , 7146 Sangamon st. , and Wentworth , 6950 Sangamon st . Boycott headquarters issued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools in Negro sections of these areas : Near north side , Altgeld Gardens , Woodlawn , ChathamAvalon , Englewood , Hyde ParkKenwood , near south side , and west side . About 100 " freedom schools " will be held , most in churches , for youngsters who skip public school . Shows Pledges to Refrain Estimates of the boycott sponsors were discounted yesterday by Aid . Kenneth Campbell 20th , who heads an aldermanic civil rights organization which has campaigned against the boycott . " They will fall far short of the 100,000 they predict , " he said . Campbell displayed at a press conference about 25,000 pledges he said his organization had obtained from Negro parents agreeing to keep their children in school . He said precinct workers expect to have 50,000 pledges this morning . Campbell charged that boycott supporters were intimidating Negro children to get them to join the boycott . Ward volunteers , he added , will provide escort service to and from school today , assisting in a program set up by the Rev. Joseph H. Jackson thru Negro Baptist churches . Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of education , and Mayor Daley issued last minute appeals to parents to ignore the boycott . " All of our citizens recognize that steps must be taken  --  and Will be taken  --  to resolve some of the basic issues that confront the school system , " Roddewig said . Daley commented that school children " should never be used as pawns , " and added this message to parents : " We 've had one boycott . Is it necessary to have another , and then another ? Every parent should ask himself : Is it Lthe boycott necessary ? " About 1,500 persons , many of them pupils , attended a rally last night in the Stone Temple Baptist church , 3622 Douglas blvd. , sponsored by the freedom day boycott committee of the Coordinating Council of Community Organization . Comedian Dick Gregory was the main speaker . Police Supt. 0 . W. Wilson said yesterday that the " image " of Chicago police in the minds of the Negro community " has been slipping in recent months , " but blamed false charges of police brutality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause might be advanced more rapidly in an atmosphere of strife , and one way to do this is to create strife between Negroes and police , " Wilson said . Comments on Newspaper He commented specifically on charges of alleged brutality that have appeared in a Negro newspaper . Wilson said that his department had received 467 charges of alleged brutality in the last year , but investigations showed that only two of the complaints were valid . In both cases , he added , policemen were disciplined . " The policeman is the best friend of the Negro , " Wilson said . " He has supported the Negro in protecting his legal rights . But we do not support illegal actions , and we resent being accused of brutality . " . To improve the impression of police in Negro areas , Wilson announced a series of meetings between " responsible Negro leaders " and police supervisory personnel . Urban Leaguer at First Edwin C. Berry , executive director of the Chicago Urban league , conferred for two hours yesterday with district commanders and other supervisors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting with Berry , Wilson told reporters that most of the complaints of police brutality stem from street arrests in which citizens resist officers . " A lot of people have the impression that it is proper to resist arrest , and then make the charge that they have been treated brutally , " he said .
