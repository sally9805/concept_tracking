txt Tax withholding on dividends and interest was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee today in a move to stop leakage of about 5500,000 , - 000 a year in income tax revenues . The committee adopted a modified version of the Kennedy Administration 's proposal for incorporation of a withholding provision in a tax revision bill it is drafting . The action , by voice vote , was described as tentative , but committee sources expressed doubt that it would be reversed . Corporations and savings institutions such as banks , building and loan associations and credit unions would be required under the plan to withhold taxes on dividends to stockholders and interest payments to depositors in much the same way as employers must do on salaries and wages . Rate Substituted They would deduct 16 2/3 per cent of each dividend or interest payment and turn the money over periodically to the Treasury . The present withholding rate on wages and salaries is 20 per cent , after personal exemptions , and the Administration proposed the same rate for dividends and interest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers whose final tax liability might be substantially less than 20 per cent after allowances for deductions and personal exemptions . With the same objective , the committee agreed to exempt from the withholding plan anyone who filed a statement declaring that his income in the year ahead would be so small that no tax would be due . This would apply , for example , to those whose personal exemptions of 5600 for each tax- payer and dependent exceeded their income . Under another provision to prevent hardships , taxpayers would be entitled to quarterly refunds during the tax year to the extent that amounts with , held exceeded their estimated tax liability . Taxpayers would prepare their final returns each year as usual and take credit for whatever tax they had already paid through withholding . If the amount withheld exceeded the tax due , they would file claims for refunds . If it was less , they : would pay the difference . To determine how much had been withheld , a taxpayer would merely divide his total income from dividends and interest by six . A person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tually receive only $833.34 . In filing his return . he would credit himself with having paid $166.66 through withholding . Similar withholding plans have been pressed periodically in Congress , but the Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , has been'hostile to the idea until now . The Senate has added such provisions to tax bills several times only to see them eliminated in SenateHouse conference . Today 's committee action encouraged predictions that the bill on which the committee is working would reach the House floor this session and win passage . The outlook in the Senate , however , was uncertain . 864 Million Loss Seen The Treasury has estimated that nearly $3,000,000.000 in dividends and interest payments each year is not reported as taxable income and that the Government consequently loses $864.000.000 in taxes . The Ways and Means Committee estimated that its withholding plan would assure the collection on a " pay-as-you-go " basis of $537,000,000 of the taxes due on the income that has been unreported each year . An unestimated amount of additional taxes also would be collected , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect as an aid to the enforcement of the tax laws . The withholding plan was the first of the Administration 's 1961 tax-revision recommendations to be approved by the committee without drastic modification . Earlier this week , the panel approved a watered-down version of the Administration proposal to limit business deductions for entertainment and other expenses . It set aside a recommendation for repeal of a special exclusion and credit available to stocksolders on their income from dividends . The committee hopes to finish preliminary voting on the bill next week and turn it over to drafting experts with the idea of taking it to the floor early next month . On Monday , it . will meet in closed session with Douglas Dillon , Secretary of the Treasury , to discuss possible variations of the Administration 's ( proposal for tax incentives to encourage business outlays for plant and equipment . The committee has already accepted , in principle and informally , the idea of including some such new tax allowances for business in the pending bill . However . it is trying to devise a substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
