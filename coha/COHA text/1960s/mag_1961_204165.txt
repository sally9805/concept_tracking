The gains and losses of the Cuban tractor deal were hotly debated in the U.S. ( see THE NATION ) , but in Latin American eyes , the proposal represents a monumental propaganda setback for Castro . Throughout the hemisphere , which Castro hopes to lure into sympathy with his Marxist revolution , the response to his ransom demand was one of disgust . Wrote Rio 's moderately liberal O Globo , whose circulation is the biggest in Brazil : " Hitler wanted to trade Jews for trucks ; Fidel Castro wants to trade Cubans for tractors . It may be that this shows progress or superiority of Communism over Naziism , but we can not see any . " <P> The more Castro gloated over the cleverness of his game , the more he lost . His cat-and-mouse demand for " indemnification " rather than the " exchange " he originally proposed revolted Latin Americans , who believe strongly in human dignity . His loud threats of " revolutionary tribunals " for the prisoners if his demands were not met only increased the horror . Cooler minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guevara , apparently got through to Castro , for Castro piped down after a few days . By then great damage had been done . <P> Around Latin America , where opinion is sometimes concerted but action rarely is , a great desire to do something arose . In Caracas wellborn ladies , of the kind who usually do not venture out by themselves , were hailing passing cars with collection cans and bold demands to " stop to help a dying man . " Argentine President Arturo Frondizi told a press conference : " I do n't believe people can be traded for things . I want all the prisoners freed . " In Montevideo , the publishers of Uruguay 's biggest papers called Castro a " slave runner " and put a tractor on a downtown platform to dramatize a fund-raising drive . Brazil 's staid , respected O Estado de Sao Paulo promised to buy one tractor itself , and was immediately flooded with offers of help from readers ; some 2,000 students paraded through the city to raise funds . A man who said he was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In nearly every country of the Americas , fund-raising committees began collecting pesos , lempiras , quetzals , balboas , cruzeiros , cordobas , bolivars , colons and sols to pay for bulldozers . <P> Radio Peking and Radio Moscow , usually so ready to side with Castro in any quarrel with the U.S. , were oddly silent about his proposal . U.S. diplomats throughout Latin America reported a sharp shift in the attitude toward Adlai Stevenson 's impending hemisphere tour . There had been warnings that he might provoke riots if he ventured south of the border in the wake of the Cuban fiasco ; the climate for his visit has improved noticeably , and his trip has been confirmed by the U.S. Stevenson 's mission : to sound out prospects for joint inter-American action to cope with Castro .
