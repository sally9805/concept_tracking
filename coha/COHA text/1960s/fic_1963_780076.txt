 | I shuddered to a chill not of the rain . The Grand Missouri in full flood was a wicked thing to see . She was a power of nature equal to the lightning , or the wind , yet deadly to a sudden traitorous degree unknown to them or to their sister elements , which man endures and charts while somehow managing to employ with profit . No man outwitted that sinuous mother of all yellow-brown waters . And doubly never did he think to contest her in the full fury of her spring temper . Still , he would try . He would seek to subdue her when she was rampaging ; when , in her turgid rage , she sprang upon and ate away her own banks , her own skin of sandy loam , her own arteries of grass and timber , her own bones of rock and soil and root . This he would do because he was man ; even as the lost poor devils my horrified glance now discovered laboring in midstream were men . " In God 's name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ? " " Not at all , " answered a quiet voice behind me . " They wish to go up the river , and they will . " I wheeled to see two men in sorry condition from rain and mud . The taller of them nodded amicably . " I 'm George Drewyer , " he said . " Who are you ? " I stared , speechless . Drewyer , or Drouillard in the French , was a legend on the river . He had been , some said , farther north and west than any white man , saving possibly the great Alexander Mackenzie . He was the companion of such legendary figures as Toussaint Charbonneau , Hugh Heney , Simon Fraser , David Thompson , Manuel Lisa and La Charrette 's own Regis Loisel . His mere name , let alone his living presence , could fire the imagination of any young fellow such as I whose entire life 's dream was to ascend the Grand Missouri and see for himself those storied mysteries of the Northwest Passage . " Frank , " I stammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Charrette . " " La Charrette ? You hear that , Captain ? We 're nigh there , I reckon . " His companion , not so tall nor pleasant , shook off the in- formation . " Damn the town , " he scowled . " It 's that river out there I 'm worried about . I do n't like the set of that current . I think Clark 's wrong this time . He ought to have stayed with the bank , caving or not . " At this , it was my turn to nod swiftly . " You are correct , Captain , " I said . " If those men continue to try to pass by the middle channel , they must fail . They will lose the keelboat and perhaps both pirogues , as well . Do you see that bad sandboil at the head of the island ? " He peered intently where I pointed . " Yes , " he said , " but I fear that Clark , out there on the river , can not . " " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . The currents take you and pound you against those rocks and that is the end of your trade goods and , like as not , of your life upon the river . " He wheeled upon his companion . " Drewyer , " he demanded , " do you suppose he 's right ? You know these people . What do you say ? " Drewyer turned to me . " You said your name was Rivet , boy ? " he asked . " Would you be related to the Rivet ? I mean Francois Rivet of La Char-rette ? " " Yes , " I replied . " I am Rivet 's nephew , named for him . " Drewyer swung back to the shorter man . " There 's your answer , Captain . This boy will know the river . Damn ! I wish there was some way we could signal Captain Clark . " " We ca n't , " said his companion doggedly . " Not in this damnable rain and roar of the river . " I can not say why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us all , I suppose , and I was being drawn by the violent , ugly death awaiting those brave men on the river . " God 's name ! " I shouted in sudden youthful anger . " Will you both stand there like two headless snags in the muck and permit them to drown ? " Drewyer wagged his head at me . " Do n't yell at the captain , sonny , " he warned . " It 's no fault of his and there 's naught he can do about it . "  | " IIa ! " I said , still shouting . " Stand aside and I shall show you something ; I can do about it , then ! " I ) rewyer 's hand shot out , pinning me with the force of a bear trap . " Hold on , you damned young fool , " he growled . " Just what do you think you 're up to ? " " Let go of me and find out ! " I challenged . " I would stand far better chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot is better than waiting with you and your captain ! " " A horse ? " said the latter , hearing me and coming up to join us . " It happens we have two of them . Yonder they come up the bluff with our hunter , John Shields . " I glanced where he pointed and saw , through the increasingly heavy drive of the rain , a man and two mounts ascending the rise . One of the animals was a bony pack brute , but the other was a clean-limbed saddler . Before either Drewyer or his sturdy captain could act further to detain me , I leaped toward the approaching hunter . I slid to a stop in front of him , holding out my rifle . " Here , " I yelled , " hold onto this ! " Surprised , he dropped the reins of the led , saddled mount , to accept the weapon . Leaping past him , I sprang on the startled animal 's back . I was already slipping off my buckskin shirt and Indian moccasins as I galloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the horse had pounded around the upriver bend toward the point above the Devil 's Raceground , I was riding stark naked and was absolutely certain that the three men behind me must be convinced they had just met , and been had the better of , by the village idiot of La Charrette.  | The chance of death was present but not probable . I was , after all , born to that river . With decent luck , the wild current would bear me down and across to the island in time to warn off the men in midstream . Buoyed by this conviction , I scrambled off my mount and ran to the shelving bank of the upstream point to which he had carried me . Here , with a quick prayer , I dived into the muddy tide . At once I was aware of extreme peril . It was like plunging into the funneled floodgate of some great pumping disgorgement of liquid earth . It was not water but a bombardment of sand , rock , gravel and suffocating fluid gumbo . Terror seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a submerged sawyer , a snag with its rooted feet sunk into the jellied bed of the river , and the blow restored my Frenchman 's spirit . Rocks continued to hurtle against me , and sand and gravel to abrade my hide , but honor was involved now and I struck back with such aroused purpose that I won to the surface again and was , within a racing five minutes , dashed up onto the island 's head , not completely sound , perhaps , but safe . Fortune was favoring the foolhardy . The instant I landed upon the rocks , the doomed men were just planting their setting poles into the island 's far flank to force their keelboat out into the full fury of the Devil 's Raceground . At the sight of me their captain , a tough-looking man whose flaming red hair was evident even through the billowing rain , shouted for his men to stand on their poles . This they did , holding the boat in the current , while I ran out into the shallows and made effort to call out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind outcried me and the red-haired captain  | waved and bellowed back with a ready smile , " Never fear , lad , well send out help to you from the village ! " I knew he had misheard me and would , next moment , order his polesmen forward into the waiting maelstrom . Again , I was left with no choice but to swim or see these poor men damned . This time , however , I was tired . As well , I misjudged the fierceness of the current there on the lee side of the island . The prow of the fifty-foot keelboat flashed by spinningly . I recall dumbly counting the oarlocks and trailing sweeps on her starboard side  --  eleven , making her a twenty-two-oared craft ? then I thought the river had me for her own , as my mind whirled and vision was blotted out . But the craggy-faced captain with the bright red hair failed to agree . In the instant of my sliding past his vessel 's flank his gaunt body was already in the air , arching into the thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sight of a boy being swept to his sure death in the flood . It was not in his purview of the situation that , in the ultimate last inch of time , one of his following pirogues should nose around the turn of the island 's lee and be swung to broadside of the raging current where we two  --  myself now supported in the captain 's muscular arms ? might be smashed against the smaller craft 's port side and be helped , half drowned , over her gunwales . She nearly swamped , at that , taking us all down , but the red-haired captain was a riverman . With himself plying a setting pole to virtually lift the seven-oared vessel out of the water , he got her nose-to in the current once more and shortly beached her safely on the island . Here I made it plain to him what awaited his little flotilla beyond the rocky head . He understood the degree of my service instantly . Embracing me with a bony arm , he bellowed for his other boatmen to bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bailing . By this time the second pirogue , the sixoared one , rounded into view and he likewise bawled her into coniing-to for an unshipping of her cargo of Missouri mudwater . Now ensued some swift discussion of our options by Cap- tain Clark and myself . I held strongly for continuing by the caving , seemingly dangerous north bank , Clark as stoutly repudiating the suggestion . " Damn it , lad , " he protested , " I 've just tried it that way and was nigh swamped half a dozen times . " " You ran it wrong , " I insisted brazenly . " Give me the tiller of the keelboat and I will take you through without shipping a teacupful . " " Clark eyed me quizzically . " You crow pretty loud for a cockerel , " he said . " You must be French . " " I am French , " I said , straightening . " Also , I know this river . As for the crowing , you should hear me when my craw is not so full of mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned good-naturedly . " Well , could be so , " he admitted . " You surely did save us from poling into that bad boil yonder . " He gestured toward the invisible inferno of the Raceground . " Still , you 're just a colt , even if full of prance . I figure I have to make my own decisions , then set on them . Right now I mean to set on this bit of land till the wind lets up . " " That wo n't be until daylight , Captain . Do you have any idea how much the Missouri will rise in one night ? " " No , I 'm an Ohio man , myself . That and the Mississippi . However , I do n't reckon the Missouri is too vastly different from them . She 'll rise maybe two feet . " " She will rise four . " " Overnight ? " " Perhaps sooner . These headland rocks are six feet out . When I went down the river this morning , they were ten feet out . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me a little queerly . One could not say that he had turned uneasy , for this was a man of such hardness as one does not see in each spring , not even along the Missouri . This is not to say a brutal hardness , but rather an inner annealing of the spirit to go with the outer gifts of bone and sinew and iron muscle . " Well , now , " he answered carefully , " we are six oars on  | the white pirogue and seven on the red . With twenty-two on the barge , American arithmetic makes it come out thirty-five . I low about your French figuring ? " 1 slid not return his light spirit , my mathematics being considerably heavier than his . " It 's little matter , " I replied . " What counts is that by first light of morning your men will be five , not thirty-five . Five , or perhaps as many as seven ; however many can cling to what small point of the rocks will be above water by that hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm found my shoulder . " Lad , " he said , " French or not , I like the way you stand up and say your piece . " He turned to the waiting , huddled boatmen , warm grin again at work . " Back to your oars , boys ! " he ordered them cheerfully . " We 've just hired on a new pilot . . . " " Sacre-bleu ! Sucre cceur ! Sucre Dieu ! " There could be small doubt that Uncle Francois was disturbed . Like our mother Missouri , the Rivet temper was on the rise . In consequence , I stood well back from the bed in the warm corner of my aunt 's kitchen where the Rivet lay anchored with a badly injured ankle . He did not deceive me with that hand held beneath the rough cover . I had seen him snatch the length of split hickory from the woodbox within his reach when he imagined I was occupied with embracing Aunt Cade . And that was when he merely thought I was too late home from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fat doe lay in the tool shed ready for skinning and she had gone out to dress  | the game , that I told him the full extent of my adventure with the American captains . It was also then that he burst forth with the heartfelt profanities . Yet , poor fellow , who could blame him ? To be so victimized by fate as to turn an ankle that badly he could not set foot to ground at the very moment when he was due to join these same captains in their ascent of the river was realistically tragic for any Frenchman , but for the Rivet it was past all tolerance . At the least it meant that his " failure " would leave a gaping hole in the already reduced ranks of the brave Americans . Skilled boatmen who knew the Missouri like Francois Rivet were not to be replaced in La Charette . The settlement consisted of seven mud huts and seven poor families , all French , or French metis mixtures . And here , in this miserable atmosphere , with no adult French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was I , Francois Rivet the Younger , his own namesake and the half-breed son of his dead brother and a heathen Pawnee squaw , who had made so bold as to offer the American captains my services as a boatman hi place of the Rivet ! It was , naturally , an insult beyond suffrance . My uncle , however , was a man of monumental charity . " Come , Frank , " he gestured forgivingly , and with what strength he had left from blaspheming my dark blood . " I would like it that you would move a little closer . The light is poor in here ; I ca n't see you well . " I advanced cautiously , stopping out of reach of the piece of stovewood beneath the blanket . " I 'd rather not come too close , Uncle . I have a cold and would not wish you to take it from me . " " Oh ? Hah ! You have a cold ? Caught since this morning , no doubt . You were healthy as a dog when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step nearer , boy . " " It is unthinkable , Uncle . " " Eh ? Why is it unthinkable ? " " Because I do n't care to be struck with that piece of hickory you are hiding under the covers . "  | He looked at me a moment , then grinned and brought out the knotty stick , dropping it on the floor , where I quickly kicked it out of his reach before seating myself at the foot of his rude bed . " Uncle , " I said , " I am truly sorry that I have embarrassed you with your patrons . I forgot in my excitement about my Indian mother . It was only in my heart that if the Rivet could not go , then some Rivet must go , metis or no . " My uncle shifted uncomfortably . " Here now , boy , " he grumbled , " say no more against your mother . She was a fine woman . And leave my patrons to me . I will think of someone for them . " " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " " It 's impossible . Neither of the captains would hire you , a half-breed . Let us say no more about it . " " But I have already said more about it . I talked with the captains and neither of them mentioned half-breed . I think they might accept me . " " Bah ! They were being kind to you because of me . They respect me . " " Well , of course , Uncle ; you are the Rivet . " " Oui ! Let yourself remember it , too , " he admonished me . " Now go and help your aunt with that venison . I am hungry and will need my full strength for the captains tonight . What a fate ! Only one good leg and a half-breed nephew to stand on it for me . Well , damn it , there 's this to be said and to be thankful for  --  the boy really has the heart of a Frenchman , yes , and the fine mind as well . That 's quite a remarkable achievement when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I left him muttering proudly to himself and went out into the early darkness thankful indeed to be even the half-breed nephew of the Rivet.  | It was full dark when the captains came . I recognized them when they drew near my hiding place in the tool shed , the one of slight build , the other rawboned and powerful . A third man was with them , a huge fellow , towering over his companions as the genie of the lamp loomed above Aladdin and , like the genie , seeming blacker than the night . I shivered with apprehension . In an extension of that peculiar good luck which had been attending me that day , Captain Lewis now chose to halt to regain his breath from the steep river-path climb . Clark waited with him . The third man , the shadowy giant , stood out of my line of vision , beyond the captains . " Will , " said Lewis , " what do you say to a pipe before we see Rivet ? It 's so pleasant here above the river . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know my weakness for the weed . " " Yes , " nodded Lewis , " and you mine for climbing river bluffs . If I had your legs and lungs , Will , I would be halfway up the Missouri by this time . " " Aye , " responded the other softly , " and if I had your education , Captain , I would be waiting there for you . " The men fell silent , intent on lighting their pipes . In the pause , I puzzled over the by-play between the two , wherein the one lamented the other 's physical strength while the other lauded his comrade 's superior training . This factor intrigued me because I was myself a young man who could both read and write and who had , morever , attended school with the Jesuits in St. Louis since early boyhood . I was hardly polished  | nor yet ready for an academic degree but I was , in the proper sense , educated . As well , being of French and Pawnee blood , a wild enough blending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The balance  --  two parts of lifejoy to one of learning ? thus allowed me to catch and comprehend the briefly spoken envies of the captains . But the pipes were going well now , and the talk resuming where it had broken off . " It 's a fact , Will , " Lewis said , " that you and I are different men . Indeed , the difference in us is what prompted me to suggest you to the President . " " I suppose , " sighed Clark , " but a lack of schooling is a serious handicap in life . " " Not the most serious , however . Where we 're going , Will , lack of another kind of knowledge would be a far more critical shortage . I refer to practical experience , the education for survival . That 's your schooling . " " I hope so , Captain . " " Will . " " Yes , Captain ? " " Must you eternally call me captain ? " " It seems right . " " Shall I then call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal rank by Mr. Jefferson . " " Aye . I 'm still a lieutenant , however , Captain . " " The promotion will come through . Ca n't you accept that ? It 's not like you to be bitter , Will . " " It 's not like Mr. Jefferson to forget a promise either , Captain . Yet he has done so . " " The President aside , Will , you insist on deferring to me anyway . You invariably yes sir ' and no sir ' me in front of the 111.11 . Why is that ? " " I do n't know , Captain . It 's in some men to look to other nun , I suppose . " " Rank or no rank , eh ? " " Yes , sir , I would say so . " Again they fell silent , smoking to cover the awkwardness of old friends having come too close in confidence .  | Lewis , as already seemed his wont to me , led the way out of the blind place . " What are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Clark shrugged . " We 'll examine his leg first . But if , as his nephew told us , he ca n't bear his weight upon it , we must replace him , and quickly . " " " Perhaps Rivet already has a replacement for us . " " I doubt that , Captain . But if he has not , I have . " " What ? You do ? Here in La Charrette ? " " Yes , sir , young Rivet . " " The boy ! You mean that demented half-breed youth who swam to the island for us ? You ca n't be serious , Will ! " " I 'm serious . " " Well , so am I. We need a man , not a boy . " " Boys make men . " " True , but this one is part Pawnee . That 's wild blood . We ca n't afford to risk such a replacement for Rivet . " " The boy 's likewise half Rivet , Captain . That 's good blood , steady and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a long time with his reply . My ears hurt with the ache of hard listening , and my heart as well . Finally , he shook his head in that quiet way of his . " I 'm afraid not , Will , " he said . " Let 's go in and see what Rivet has for us of information and advice . " Clark said no more . The two captains , followed by the huge dark fellow who had spoken no word the entire time , turned quickly for the door of my uncle 's house .  | My Aunt Celie 's fine large woodbox was constructed to be filled from the outside , emptied from within the house . If I t lined the effort correctly , I could sneak into it from the outside while the guests were being admitted at the front of the house . Then I could eavesdrop and spy upon all that passed between Uncle Francois and the American captains . Leaping from the tool shed , I sped to the rear of the cabin and was successful in stowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breath held , I crouched to peer between the wide cracks of roughsawn board which sheltered me . Only the two captains entered . The huge third fellow stood guard outside the front door . Lewis got at once to the business which had brought him . " Well , Rivet , " he began , " I am sorry to see you in this state . I understand you can not put weight on the limb . Do you realize what this means ? " " Oui , Capitaine " " Do you have someone who might take your place ? A good riverman with something of your own skills and reliability ? " My uncle shook his head . " I have no such man , Capitaine , " he said , " but I do have such a boy . " My heart jumped in the same moment as Captain Lewis 's outraged eyebrows . " I ) auin it , Rivet , " complained the mercurial commander , " I 'm tired of hearing about this metis boy of yours ! " " Not niy boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's boy . You have heard of Achille Rivet , of course ? This nephew of mine is Achille 's true son by the Pawnee woman ,  | Antelope , a daughter of the chief , Lame Horse . A very fine woman , now dead , may God rest her soul . " Lewis nodded stiffly . " I 'm sure she was a fine woman , Rivet , " he said , " but you will still need to get us another man to pull your oar . " Uncle Francois turned impulsively to Clark . " Please , Patron , " he said , " take the boy ; he will make a man , once up the river . " Clark 's homely face showed agreement , but his reply did not . " It 's not mine to say , Rivet , " he answered . " Captain Lewis has made the decision and has his reasons . " Uncle Francois came up on one elbow , face reddening . " Pah ! " he virtually shouted . " I know his reasons and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he waved to Lewis , " but I speak the truth in my own house ! " " Go ahead , Rivet , " said Lewis firmly , " speak it , then . " " Voila ! I shall ! You distrust my nephew because of one thing , alone , his Indian blood . Well , Capitaine , permit me to ask you just a single thing in this regard ; how long have the Americans been in this land of the Louisiana ? That is to say , against we French ? Ha ! I thought so . No time whatever . And this boy is a Rivet above his mother 's blood , do you hear ? There was a Rivet with La Salle . There was a Rivet with the Verendryes , father and son , the first white man to see this Upper Missouri where you are bound . That Rivet came all the way from Lake Winnipeg to the Mandan villages below the Big Bend . And do you recall what that date was , Capitaine ? Aha ! allow me to refresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet you will question the devotion to his land of a Rivet of this same blood , native mother or no ? " Captain Lewis accepted the charge in his blunt way , no whit persuaded by its eloquence . " Love of land does not constitute loyalty to President Jefferson and the United States . May I remind you , Rivet , that this expedition is substantially a secret mission ? " " Hah ! What of that ? " demanded my uncle . " This boy 's fondest dream is to be an American . He was reared in the Louisiana and French , yes , but now that the United States has  | purchased this Louisiana from France , many of us regard ourselves as part of the transaction , and my nephew Frank particularly so . I le tells me that your President has said he hopes that the people of Louisiana will want to join as equal citizens , and that he invites them to do so . Well , I can tell you , Capitaine , tl iat Frank Rivet accepts this proposal with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus ! how can you challenge him ? He was born on the prairies of Teton River , where that stream enters the Missouri above the Grand Detour . It was the winter of 1786 , and that fact is recorded in the register of such things which the Jesuits keep in St. Louis . Achille , my brother , brought the baby down the river and had him baptized . The boy is legal . He is an American , if he wants to be  --  born to this land , and of it , as much even as you . He is no bastard and no half-breed and no wild Pawnee horse Indian . He ispah ! ? I give up , forget the entire matter . He is a Rivet . No man can say more ! " To my vast relief both captains were smiling when Uncle Francois finished . It was not that they were amused by his fervor , but rather , completely warmed by it . " Well now , Rivet , " said Lewis , moving closer to his bedside , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Nor , indeed , to demean the lad 's mother . It 's his youth I object to , hence the quality of his judgment . A boy is still a boy , even a Rivet boy . As a man grown yourself , will you argue that ? " My heart plummeted . This was logic , and my Uncle Francois was a logical man . Moreover , I could see that Captain I , ewis was a clever one . His seemingly straightforward manner cloaked a mind as sharp and cutting as a Hudson 's Bay axblade . But Uncle Francois was not precisely a simple man , either . " ' There is still the matter of the Indian blood , Capitaine , " he said . " A quick answer is not necessarily a true one . Would you take the boy in my place were his mother not a Pawnee squaw ? " Lewis had an oval face . Small of mouth and long and slen- der of nose , it was neither handsome nor attractive . It looked even less promising now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's confrontation . " Captain Clark , " he said , " will you be so good as to examine Rivet 's leg ? Our time runs short . " Clark , who was apparently the company doctor , bent over the patient , plying the ankle carefully . I could hear the bones grate . Clark straightened . " It 's broke sure , Captain . I 'll need to get my satchel and splint it for him . You coming ? " " No , I 'll stay here and question Rivet . The President wanted me to inquire after old Mr. Boone , and I would like to know for myself what news there is of Regis Loisel , Cedar Island and things in general up the river . Hurry , though . We must repack those midships lockers on the big barge so to be away with first light . " Clark departed and Lewis and my uncle resumed . In the stale-aired woodbox , I suffered the passage of the talk as best I might , helpless to move for fear of discovery . " Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he is living presently down on Femme Osage Creek . Now seventy years , he is showing his age to be certain , but seems likely to last a few more winters . What a tragedy , though , eh ? That such a great man in his country 's recent history should be so soon forgotten . Would not one think that the famous Daniel Boone deserved better than a log hut on Femme Osage Creek a few miles from La Charrette ? " " I admit the shoddiness of the treatment , " said Lewis . " Be sure and tell the old fellow that Mr. Jefferson asked after his health . Now , how about Loisel and Cedar Island ? " " Well , " answered my uncle , " I have learned only this same afternoon that Loisel is coming down the river and will be in La Charrette some time tonight . He nooned at the Gasconade yesterday , and is thus considerably overdue here . I expect , " added my uncle , cocking an ear , " that he may be making his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotion down there below the bluff , right now ? "  | Ile did , indeed , hear this commotion , for I heard it myself and knew , as he did , that it was Loisel 's party . Lewis , after a moment , nodded his agreement . " 1 ' 11 go down with Captain Clark after he fixes your leg , Rivet . Meanwhile , what do you hear of flood conditions immediately above ? Also , how about farther up ? " Ile and Uncle Francois fell to discussing channel shiftings , current changes , new bars and the like , while I cursed my confinement and my despair . Down at the landing , where the Regis Loisel party was returning from upriver Indian trading , there would be high talk of wild lands and great adventure . And here was I , trapped like an animal between my uncle 's bed and my aunt 's cookstove until Captain Clark should return and depart again . The following ten minutes were agony multiplied , the next fifteen worse . Yet at last the term did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my uncle said the thing which determined the totally new course of my life . He and Lewis had progressed in their discussion as far up the river as the confluence of the Cannonball , just below the Mandan villages . My uncle had unfurled his charts of the Missouri , put his finger upon the juncture of the two streams and now , after a dramatic , deliberate pause , said softly : " It was just here , Patron , that my brother Achille was swept overboard and never seen again . We searched the bank for many days but no body was ever recovered . It is why the legend persists , you see , even today . " " Oh ? " said Lewis , faintly interested . " What legend is that ? " " Of my brother , Achille Rivet . The Indians say that he is still alive somewhere west of the buffalo , that he was found and taken prisoner by the Teton Sioux and traded by them beyond the Big Rock Mountains to the evil Shoshone , the Snake Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rivet ? " My uncle raised his eyes and crossed himself . " We never found the body , " he said .  | My father , Achille Rivet , the legend of the river , was not dead but still very much alive and a captive of the Shoshone Indians ? The possibility stunned me . I was five years old when my father brought me down the river to the Jesuit blackrobes in St. Louis and said to them , " Here is my son of a red mother ; keep him and make him a white man . " I was still five years old when , that same spring , my father went back up the river with my Uncle Francois , to be carried away by the great current at the mouth of the Cannonball . I was seven before the fathers told me that Achille Rivet had drowned in that high water of the 1791 springtime . They never hinted , nor did Uncle Francois or Aunt Celie , that a legend persisted after him . Why this deception I could not now imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Clark to come and be gone , I thought , in my swiftly rising resentment , that I might guess quite closely . The Jesuits , as representatives of God on earth , could afford no partnership in heathen Indian fables . Six Christian boatmen of the True Faith , in addition to my Uncle Francois , had witnessed the closing of the floodwater sarcophagus . They had reported my father dead . The Mass had been said for him and Uncle Francois had paid four prime fox pelts for it and a rosary . Mother Church did not waste her labors , nor Francois Rivet his fox pelts . In pace requiescat Achille Rivet . Yet surely I must be more generous . The good fathers and my aunt and uncle had no doubt denied me the tenuous hope of the legend in the belief that it was a cruel lie and that in its  | useless harboring I might sicken my mind or spirit . I could not supply a better answer , nor was one needed . The news itself excused everything . What I owed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . My foster parents had given rue a decent home and upbringing . What my French father and wild Indian mother had bequeathed me was a tough , hard body and a totally independent mind . For myself I had added a sharp eye for subterfuge together with an optimistic determination to see the lighter side of life when fortune should fail to favor Frank Rivet . Accordingly , what I did there in my foul-aired prison was to begin mixing a sincere prayer of thanks with an equally sincere assortment of curses at the slowness of the red-headed captain 's return . This litany was at once interrupted by Clark 's booming hail at the front of the house and , under cover of his cheerful entrance , I raised the outer lid of the woodbox and made good my escape into the rear yard . My way , of course , now lay clear before me . The expedition of the American captains was bound for those very Big Rock Mountains wherein my father was rumored to lie a captive of the fierce Shoshone . I must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ways and means of accomplishing this venturesome resolve , what better course than to trail the captains back down the bluff and , under the commotion of their meeting with the newly arrived Regis Loisel , stow away aboard the big twenty-two-oared keelboat ? When eventually , and far up the river , I was discovered , the courage of a lowly metis boy in undertaking such a perilous deception  --  and for such heartfelt reason  --  could not fail to captivate the friendly Americans . I knew these men . They were not like the French and the Indians , ever ready to bend and delay or to argue meaningless legalities and traditions . The Americans were the same as I was . They felt a thing : uul they did it . They did n't sit around all winter talking it over , and they never backed out once they had started . They were creatures , not of the mind , but of the heart , and I thanked God that the Jesuits and my Uncle Francois had let me know that I  | was born to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an American , and crazy . As the irrational pride in this idea spread tingling along my cramped limbs , I heard the captains coming out of the cabin . They were brief with their farewells at the door and made off down the bluff trail with long , purposeful strides . In my hurry to keep pace with them while still not risking discovery , I forgot about the third man who had been with them guarding the front of the house as they talked within . No more than two minutes along the trail I felt the prickling of the neckhairs which men reared in the wilderness understand to be a warning that something is behind them . I wheeled to flee but was too late . The great black form loomed over me , the giant hand closing on the nape of my neck as I uttered a terrified cry . Next instant my feet were dangling in mid-air , and York , Captain Clark 's huge Negro servant , was presenting me like a miserable house-wetting puppy to his master . " Cap'n , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " look here what I cotch sneaking along ahint you . " He set me down on the ground before the accusing gazes of the two captains , and Lewis said quite severely , " See here , were you actually following us , boy ? " I admitted it , saying I had meant only to go see the meeting with Loisel and to listen to the exciting talk of Cedar Island and the Teton Sioux . " Natural enough , " put in Captain Clark understandingly . " Come on along and welcome , lad . Were I your age , I 'd be of the selfsame mind . " Lewis was not so naive . " Wait , " he commanded . " Why this sneaking then ? " " Uncle Francois forbade me to go , " I lied , but York at once waved a hand the size of a haunch of venison . " He was hiding in the woodbox , Cap'n Lewis . I seen him . He trope out of it when you all was fixing Mister Rivet 's laig . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lewis charged . " Oh , why not , Captain ? " asked Clark . " He 's only a kid ; this is big adventure to him . " " It is to us , also , " nodded Lewis . " I do n't trust this boy ,  | Will . He has something more than youthful curiosity in view . What is it , Rivet ? What are you up to ? Working for the British ' ' ? " " Here ! here ! " laughed Clark . " You ca n't be serious , Captain . This is the nephew of Francois Rivet , the Rivet . What would he be doing with the English ? " " Shying , perhaps . " " Never ! " I broke in indignantly . " I , the son of Achille Rivet , a British spy ? You are quite mad , Captain ! " " Well , at least quite careful , " said Lewis . " Run along home , boy . Mind your uncle . " " Oh , let him tag along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than normally nosey . I like the lad . " " " Go home , boy , " repeated Lewis , " and stay there . " There was no compromise in his tone and Captain Clark put his calloused fingers gently to my shoulder . " I know how you feel , Frank , " he said . " I ran away from home when I was younger than you . But do n't you do it , you hear ? You 're a smart boy . I can tell from your talk . You stay to home and keep in school . " " Yes , sir , thank you , Captain , " I muttered . " You 're a kind man and understand boys better than some . " " Do n't be too hard on Captain Lewis now , " he chided . " He 's the head of this expedition and has much on his mind besides itchy-footed boys . " " I thought you were both the heads of the expedition , " I said quickly , and with some disappointment . Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well now , that 's so , boy , we are . But Captain I , ewis he 's the main head of it , you might say . " " You coming , Will ? " put in Lewis abruptly . " Yes , sir , " Clark nodded , " right off . Good-bye , boy , " he added , " and remember next time you want to run away , do n't try it with old York around . He can hear a mouse high in a wall . Or a milkweed land in deep dust . And eyesight ? Why , lad , the cat 's not been littered that can move around in the night like my York . " " Yes , Rivet , " put in Lewis severely , " and do n't get it in  | your mind to follow us up the river , either . You have been told you ca n't go , and why you ca n't go . Now do n't let us see you again before we sail . " I turned my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Thank you , lad , for whatever you said , " smiled the redheaded captain , and wheeled about to follow Lewis down the bluff . Behind them trotted the giant African , York . Left alone on the steep trail , I felt the threat of misting tears and cursed manfully . " God 's name ! " I cried aloud . " Do I intend to stand here and tell myself that I am this easily defeated ? " Evidently , and for the honor of my uncle 's name , I did not . Within less than a full minute of the captains ' departure , I was again moving for the riverfront landing . I went by a secret path which I alone knew , and so encountered no more delays . As I came up to the site of Loisel 's debarkment , the rain of the past afternoon was setting in again . There was great gain in this for me , since the blustery showers hid my approach to the leaping bonfire about which the men of Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loisel himself , that bearded raffish adventurer of the upper river , held the center of discussion . Lewis was his principal interrogator . Clark , as was his watchful way , stood back and listened . I was able to come up very close and lie behind a large cottonwood driftlog . The interchange at once became fiercely exciting . It was all about the wild lands zoo or 300 or 400 leagues up the Mis- souri . Famous and infamous Indian chiefs weaved in and out of the conversation . Tribes were named which might be counted friendly , unfriendly , trustworthy , thieving , kind , murderous . Outlandish and wondrous place names fell from Loise.l 's lips . Cheyenne River . Bad River . Grand Detour . Knife River . Land of the Mandan . White Earth . Big Muddy . Bear I'aws . Medicine River . Musselshell . Little Manitou . Yellowstone . Prairie of Arrows . Sand Island . Vermilion River . Spirit Mound . I could scarce restrain myself from bounding up and shouting , " Come on , why do you stand here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then came the Indian tribal names . Omahas . Poncas . Loups . Pawnees . Sauks . Kaws . Arikaras . Sioux . Mandans . Minnetarees . Gros Ventres . Blackfeet . Bloods . Snakes and Flatheads and Crows . What magnificent words ! And next , the almost equally stirring names of the fabled frontiersmen of the white brother who traded or traveled through the red man 's domain . Pierre Dorion . Jean Valle . John Evans . James Mackay . Pierre-Antoine Tabeau . Hugh McCracken . And , of course , the aging , great Touissant Charbonneau . I even heard , to my startled pride , the name of my father , Primaut Achille Rivet . How can one convey the true feeling that passes over him as he hears the name of his natural parent set down in historic council between such as those of Tabeau and of Toussaint " the Squawman " Charbonneau ? It was an immense thing , almost frightening . But Loisel was speaking more swiftly now , his words rattling and popping like sparks from the fire . The river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be watched all the way up to the Mandan Nation . The Missouri was rising and falling like a crazy woman . She would be one night four feet into the bank willows . Next dawn would find her dropped to the mid-channel sandbars , or her course shifted fifty feet from where the pirogues had been beached with the past darkness . As for the redmen , some seditious word of the altered ownership of the Louisiana had been spread among them by the damnable British . All the warlike tribes were being deliberately  | alarmed with wild tales that the Americans were coming to take their hunting lands away from them , to cheat them and steal from them and do wrong things with their women . As a result , the savages were especially not to be trusted this spring . Below Teton River only hard vigilance might be required , but when it came to the homicidal and treacherous " Tetongues , " the verminous , villainous " Souex , " they were the ultimate true terrorists of the upper river , and they must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most deadly venom . Their territory began in the vicinity of the river named for their tribe and continued to the confluence of Le Fleuve Couteau , the Knife River , where began the legendary villages of the Mandan . Never forget that land nor the Sioux fiends who roamed it , advised Regis Loisel . Remember , too , their ill-famed chief , called the Partisan . He was a wolf , and his people were wolves with him . There were the names of a few good chiefs which could be given . Black Buffalo was a wise and steady man . Second Bear , Considerable Man , Medicine Buffalo , these had some record for reliability . Yet the general council held : the Teton Sioux would kill the white man if he could . Loisel himself had barely come down the river with his own life just now , because of an ambush by these same unnatural sons of hell . Now the American captains must be ever alert to these monsters , and ... The trader 's grim warning carried on , but one senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps already delayed too long in my listening . The friendly rain was thinning momentarily , weakening the cover under which I must now belatedly make my way aboard the keelboat . I slid away from behind the log and , crouching over , circled around the beach toward the big barge . I had come up to within thirty feet of her plank when a rift in the rain let me see , standing guard at this station so vital to my plan , the giant Negro , York . Helas ! What a cruel trick of fate ! However , there was no delay possible here . Behind me I  | could hear Regis Loisel rising to his final period . I must act , must risk all , or turn and flee like a whipped dog . Frantically I surveyed the winning chance . At the helm of the fifty-five-foot vessel squatted the figure of a boatman . I knew his duty . It was to keep the debris of the I I o od it ! g river from fouling the helm while the craft lay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped " overboard into the swift water , he would be swept downstream 200 yards where he would land safely athwart a sandbar . But he would not know of this haven , nor would York ; hence his seeming peril of drowning might draw the great Negro from his guardpost long enough for me to slip aboard and bestow myself among the cargo . My problem now became how to get at the helmsman without prematurely alerting the black picket at the gangplank . The answer , if any , lay by water . I had demonstrated earlier that I was no match for York on dry land . But how by water ? As suddenly as I asked myself , I knew . The answer lay upstream . There a certain bank current would take me neatly by the outriver flank of the moored barge . It was indeed the same current upon which I counted to waft away the sentry at the helm . Voila tout ! The whole thing was extremely simple , after all . Up the bank I scuttled like some inland crab , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoes included , as any French-Indian crustacean . In an instant the sluggish shore eddy swirled me out into the grip of the main shore-set , and I took the longest breath I might and bit into the current with my teeth . Down the river I went , six feet below the surface and shooting along like a slim log . Not daring to be swept past the boat , I surfaced when I thought to be abreast of her . Hell 's flames ! I was forty feet outside my goal , and bobbing past her with millrace speed . Wildly I clawed toward her , cross current , still struggling to stay below water and undiscovered . When breath could no longer be contained , I came up again . Air Dieu ! The glistening , sturgeon-gray flank of the keelboat was just sliding past . I had missed ! And yet , had I ? In the  | final second I struck out desperately atop the water , no thought or chance remaining of avoiding detection . My fingers grazed , then sunk into the slimy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derelict steersman grunted a mildly disinterested " Huh ? " then inquired mumbling of himself , " What the hell was that ? " and leaned over the stern to satisfy the matter . Automatically my arm shot upward , my hand fastening in his jacket collar . It was only after I had then jerked him clear of the deck and over my head , sprawlingly into the water , that I realized he wore the uniform of a private in the Army of the United States . " God 's name ! " I cried out unthinkingly , seeing him dashed away down the boiling current , " I have thrown overboard an American soldier ! Heart of Jesus , they will hang me ! " But I was allowed no time to suffer this fear . The thud of naked feet running on deck planking raced toward the stern and the great batlike form of York soared over me to splash into the Missouri in rescue pursuit of the disappearing soldier . Still moving as if by mechanics  --  it certainly was not by intelligence ? I hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river side of the keelboat 's high-piled cargo . Up near the prow I dived under a loosened deck tarpaulin into the welcome warm embrace of a bale of trade blankets . Here I wormed in completely out of sight , pulling the loosened canvas tight behind me . Then , and only then , did I begin to think . What I thought , having the Gallic weakness for applying proverbs , was tout est bien qui finit bien , all 's well that ends well . And I liked the thought so well that , as I now smiled broadly and settled back into my snug harbor , I repeated it distinctly aloud , just to relish the superior French sound of it on the tongue . Here was another weakness , and a worse one . No sooner did the words come out of my mouth than a very familiar voice replied to them from directly outside my canvas shelter . " Well now , Frank , that may be , " said the voice , " but were I you , I would n't crow about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I gasped . " Capitaine Clark ! " I groped for  | something to add which might help me , and came up with a purely useless , " But I did n't know that you understood French , Patron ! " thought I heard his warm chuckle . " It 's not French I understand , lad , " he said . " It 's boys . I knew you 'd circle around and come back . Spotted you behind the log , yonder , right off . Sent fork down to watch the plank . Figured you 'd try to sneak on the boat that way and be caught for sure . But then you were too smart for that , all along . " I said nothing to disabuse him . " Patron " ? my voice quavered ? " what will they do to me ? " " Depends on whether they catch you . " " But you will give me over to Captain Lewis , of course ? " " Du n no , boy . Have to think about it . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My heart leaped . " Captain , " I whispered , " does that mean that you might ? " " Never you mind what it means , " he replied sternly . " Hush up . Here comes the search party . They 've fished Frazer out of the river and will want to know for certain who spilled him into it . " " They will discover me ! I am undone ! " " Could be , boy . It all hangs on whether you keep on yelling , and on how long it takes me to think . As to that , I always do better setting down with a good fresh pipe . " I heard the scrape of the match and saw the glimmer of its flare through the canvas . He put it to the bowl of his Missouri cob , sucking noisily . " Over this way , men , " he called out . " I thought I saw the rascal make for the forward cargo here . " My heart sank at this seeming treachery , but next moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he took his seat on my bale of blankets . " No , no , " he ordered sharply to the men pounding up , " not right here ; over there more toward the port bow . Likely under those flour bags . " The feet thumped obediently off . I thought to start a sigh of small relief when another familiar American voice froze my gratitude . " Did you actually see someone , Will ? " it demanded suspiciously  --  indeed , accusingly.  | I shivered . I could envision Lewis standing there , jaw thrust , neck turtled forward and eyes intent , in that focusing of utter attention which characterized his attitude toward information of any kind . But Clark was also cut of wary stuff , and watchful . " Well no , Captain , " he replied , " not precisely . There was only this general impression of somebody running forward from the stern . " " That 's absolutely all ? " " I reckon . I 've sat here ever since and not seen a bilge rat stir . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , but he well may have slipped back to the stern . I will check down there . Look sharp now . " " Oh sure , Captain , you know me . I 'll set right here till the last bale 's lifted and looked under . " Lewis strode off down the deck . The noise of the continuing search of the forward cargo went on menacingly , but Captain Clark had meant what he said . He was indeed a slow thinker . It was only after the last stack of trade goods had been shifted and replaced that he stood up and knocked out the embers of his pipe . " All right , men , " he said , " let 's go help Captain Lewis . There 's naught up here but the night wind . " I did not awake until strong daylight . At first I did not recall where I was , but soon the cheery calls of the boatmen and the gruff orders of Captain Clark reminded me . Bien ! I had done it . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  | more , I was with the American captains , Lewis and Clark , on their expedition to find a path by water across the vast Louisiana . ' 1'lie Northwest Passage ! What wilder stuff might an eighteen-year-old boy feed his imagination in May of 1804 ? Al well , such provender might be fine for the mind . For the body it was inadequate . Water ! Sweet Mary , how I wanted water ! Each swish of an oarsman 's blade , each set and sucking retrieve of the polesman 's ironshod staff , drove me to the brink of surrender . I believed certainly that Captain Clark had forsaken me and that by nightfall I should be dead beneath the smothering canvas of the deck tarpaulin . From under the lower edge of this prisoning shroud I could see down the entire length of the barge , bow to stern . The men were shipping their oars and stowing their poles of a sudden . A spanking breeze had sprung up and the sail had been unfurled . Beneath me the keelboat came alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the angle of my view , I could also see the white and red dots of the two pirogues following the mother ship . The flash of the morning sun off their paddles , the whiteness of the sailing cloud above them , the deep blue of the clearing skies and , overall , the smells of spring on the Missouri momentarily assuaged my inner hurts . But if I had forgotten my pangs , they soon enough remembered me . All I could see or think of was the mossy water barrel lashed to its moorings not a dozen feet from my hiding place . When , presently , Captain Clark came forward with a pewter plate heaped with boiled meat and biscuit for his noon dinner , I nearly fainted . One might think he had come to bring this food for me , save that his companion , also bearing a full plate , was Captain Lewis . Since the latter had just come aboard by canoe from a settler 's cabin above us on the stream , it was obvious that a serious council was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate manner of sitting upon a large box of glass trade beads precisely next to my bale of blankets . " Take the powder can , Captain , " he said to Lewis in his straight-ahead manner , " and let 's get to it . "  | I saw Lewis 's feet move to a squat canister of gunpowder . Sighingly he sat down upon it . " All right , Will , " he answered . " But first let us have this bite . I 've not eaten since noon yesterday . " I could sense Clark 's sympathetic nod . " Yes , it gets a bit busy now and again , " he said , putting his own plate on the deck at his feet . " 1 believe that I shall build a pipe while you begin . For some reason I do n't have much appetite . Might be I et too much of the fatback this morning . " I stared at the plate of meat and biscuit abandoned outside my lair . It was sour brisket and the gray hardtack was gritty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc the menu took on the aroma of roast wild turkey and spoonhread . I nearly strangled in my own saliva . Clark , compounding my misery , lit his pipe and blew me the scent of rich burley . Moreover , he deliberately got up and went to the water barrel and dipped his tin tankard full from it . He then returned and sat down , pulled a lip-smacking draft from it , and placed it upon the deck with the plate of food . In the bright sunlight I could see the beads of condensation form and trickle down the clean metal sides of the cup . I almost whimpered . Lewis ate in silence . Clark smoked his infernal pipe . Down the deck the men continued to lounge at their noon mess . Only the helmsman stood to his post . The midday breeze curled steadily and strong up the river . It was a scene of both excitement and despair . I cursed my helplessness . Yet , even as I did , Captain Lewis put down his emptied plate and brought out his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredible thing occurred : the large , bony-ankled foot of Captain Clark adroitly shoved its owner 's untouched plate in under the edge of my canvas . Next moment the same foot maneuvered the sweating tankard to follow the food dish . Covering this charity , the red-haired captain cleared his throat and spat noisily to leeward . " Well now , Captain , " he said , " what is it we must decide ? The wind holds fair , the weather clear . " " Nothing to decide , Will , " answered the other . " Only the matter of reviewing our instructions from the President . Mr.  | Oglethorpe , the settler at the creek mouth yonder , tells me the British continue to arouse the Indians upcountry . Three trading parties have come down past his place this week , all complaining of trouble . " I fell to eating , spellbound despite my ravenous hunger . " Well , " Clark said , unconvinced , " you know I do n't take the dubious look at the Indian that most do , Captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to admire more than detest him . " " I realize that , " granted Lewis a trifle sharply . " But then it 's not given to each of us to be the younger brother of George Rogers Clark . " My ears tingled at this . I had not realized my rough , redheaded riverboatman was the brother of the famous American Indian fighter . " I 'll not gainsay your claim , Captain , " replied Clark easily . " Being George 's brother has helped a lot . " " I 'm convinced of that , Will . Your brother 's reputation permits you to move among the Indians with an assurance denied the rest of us . The Indians are impressed . " " So am I , Captain , to hear it the way you tell it , " grinned Clark . " It 's good I 've a steady head for flattery . " " Yes , Will , and a stout oak heart for faithfulness , too . But we 've real worries all the same . If we are to encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Pacific in time . You will recall our parting warning on that from Mr. Jefferson . " " You mean about the British also pushing to occupy the Columbia ? Leastways the north part ? " " Precisely . Mackenzie , in 1799 , withdrew from the British North West Company in the dispute over how best to open up Canada 's western territories . We both know that by western territories ' Mackenzie meant a goodly portion of the northern part of what the President contends we have obtained through the Louisiana Purchase . " " That 's right , Captain , " said Clark thoughtfully . Lewis nodded , frowning . " Will , " he said , " the hard fact of this history we are in- volved with is that the Louisiana can mean to the United States just what we are able to make it mean . If we do not explore and map and plant the flag on what Mr. Jefferson insists is ours , then we have failed and the expedition has failed with us . The Purchase will be a diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , with God 's help and the President 's foresight , have been given the chance to make it mean . " He clenched his slender jaw , frown darkening . " This is a shadow empire we gamble to declare upon , Will , " he said . " No man knows its true meets and bounds . It is as though our government had given France $15,000,000 and France had , for this amount , waved her hand to the west of the Mississippi River and said , " Dear friends , there is the land . We have no chart of it for you . The Spanish have measured it one way , the British another . It is for the United States to apply her own geography , to draw up and submit her own tracts of sovereignty . As for us French , au revoir et bonheur ! " Lewis paused . One could sense his excitement , yet when he spoke again it was with pure frustration . " It 's a frightening prospect , Will , " he declared . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenacity of the British . We know they intend taking the northern reaches of this land from us , given the opportunity . This current arousal of the upriver tribes proves it and returns us to the warning Mr. Jefferson read us from Mackenzie 's book . That book , Will , holds the British blueprint . You know it , I know it , the President knows it . Yet at times I wonder if we have not , all of us , been led astray by our imaginations and uncertainties . " He paused once more , shaking his head . " Still , we know that Mackenzie believed implicitly that British sovereignty did and should extend south to the fortyfifth parallel . What he called his rectified boundary between the United States and Canada would have to run on a line through the southern Dakotahs and the mid-Oregon country ; hence that part of the Louisiana in possible contention is vast indeed , and scarcely exaggerated by either Mr. Jefferson 's or our own beliefs . "  | IIere he hesitated a very long time . Clark did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These two plain captains and this tiny , raffish crew of French boatmen and American soldiers composed the fragile lance of empire . That lance was now in danger of being shattered by the provoked hostility of the upriver tribes . It took a powerful gift of imagination to grasp the extent of the expedition 's mnission , as well as its vulnerability to a few hundred naked savages with no concept of the stakes at play . But I could see the far-glittering American star . I could see it with the passionate eye of a Frenchman and with the smoldering eye of a wild-horse Indian . And the prospect was sufficient to hold me mute and breathless . In the stillness Lewis went on . " Will , " he said , " would you think me daft if I asked you to read me that passage in Mackenzie which the president marked for us ? I would like to study it again in the context of this clear air and bright sunshine . I sometimes wonder if the pipesmoke and cigar fumes at the Capitol do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could hear Clark 's low chuckle , and evidently he reached to take the copy of Mackenzie 's journal from Lewis . " Voyages from Montreal , " he began reading . " By Sir Alexander Mackenzie . Being an account of his journey by the overland route from Fort Chippewyan to the Pacific Coast . The first white man to chance this ? " " Yes , yes , " Lewis interrupted impatiently . " We know all that . " " Just so , " agreed Clark , unruffled . By opening this intercourse between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , and forming regular establishments through the interior and at both extremes , as well as along the coasts and islands , the entire command of the fur trade of North America might be obtained from 48 ? North to the pole , except that portion of it which the Russians have in the Pacific . To this may be added the fishing in both seas and the markets of the four quarters of the globe . Such would be the field for commercial en- terprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by the operations of that credit and capital which Great Britain so pre-eminently possesses . Then would this country begin to be remunerated for the expenses it has sustained in discovering and surveying the coast of the Pacific Ocean , which is at present left to American adventurers ... . When Clark closed the journal and returned it , the silence resettled itself between the captains . " My God , " said Lewis after a long while . " The entire command of the fur trade of North America ? The fishing in both seas and the markets of the four quarters of the globe ? Will , if that does n't sound like a manifesto for Her Majesty 's Government to move into our American Northwest , what does it sound like ? " Clark stood up , sturdy legs braced . " Sounds more like an invitation to a boat race , Captain , " he answered , low-voiced . " Let 's lay to with the oars and help this Louisiana wind to win it for us. "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . As for the second , the river is full of it . " " Please , Captain ! " I pleaded . " I 'm desperate ! " " We all are , " he answered . " If you listened well yesterday to that reading of mine from Mackenzie 's manifesto , you will understand the state of our morale . If you come out now Captain Lewis will put you ashore without a rifle or supplies of any sort . He is in no mood to be surprised by stowaways . You set tight , lad . You 've another day or so to suffer at very best . " . That was the last of him for twenty-four hours . Later that night I dipped some water from the river to drink . As well , I stretched my arms and legs on the deck . Clark fed me a little next night , and the next . It was the following , fifth , evening which threatened everything . I was at my limit by then . The matters of voiding bladder and bowel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forays for drinking water , all conspired to bring me to the end . Or so I thought . " Lad , " Clark told me , " we 've been doing badly enough . Seven miles today . You will recall that two nights ago we had only passed the mouth of the Gasconade . This evening we are scarce thirty-five miles farther . " " Sacre cceurr " I whispered . We 're still too near La Charrette . I am undone ! " " Not if you 're the boy I risked my neck for , Frank . " This touched me . I realized his action in hiding me could earn him severe censure from Lewis . Perhaps it might even go against his name in the permanent records of the expedition . I straightened with pride . " I am that boy , " I told him . " I am cold and wet and aching with ague and shrunken-belly gripes , but I am that boy . Give nie the food , please . " Clark cleared his throat . " That 's another test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's scarce aboard . No game ashore . Drink a lot of water tonight . It 'll fill you up and ease the griping. " ' l'lhis time he had to leave me abruptly . Lewis was aboard the keelboat that evening and now came striding up from the stern to ask something of his co-captain . Clark went quickly  | to meet him and I was left alone with my misery . Suddenly , absolutely without a sound , two of the most immense , pink-soled , bare and blue-black feet in the New World came to a rest before my bale of blankets . Next moment York had squatted down on his hams outside my nest and said in his wondrously deep voice . " Do n't make a sound , white boy . You let out one peep , Cap'n Lewis will throw you over the side for certain . Here , " he added , raising the canvas , " the deck 's clear , come on out and eat ; I brang you some cold vittles . " I did not question him . The food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was meat and I was starving . Emerging from my hated cage , I began wolfing it down . When the last of it was lodged solidly in my windpipe , I leaned over the side of the boat and sucked up a pint of the Missouri 's thin mud . " York , " I sighed , " may the Almighty bless you until you are more handsomely rewarded . You must also thank your good master for sending you to me . Ah , what bliss ! " The huge Negro shook his head . " Master did n't send me , boy , " he said . " What ? He did n't ? " " Nope , he do n't even know that I know you 're on the boat . He 'd skin me alive , happen he caught me here . " A quite large suspicion loomed belatedly . " York , " I said accusingly , " you 've known all along I was on the boat . You knew it when they were searching for me at La Charrette . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I did , white boy . " " But you kept quiet because you saw that your master was protecting me , is that it ? " " Nope , that ai n't it . " " No ? Well then , in God 's name , what was your reason for honoring my secret ? " This time he took longer with his answer , but he was very sure with it when it came . " Because , " he said , " when I was outside the door to your uncle 's house , I heard what they all say in there . I heard them  | call you inetis , and I know what that means . You ai n't all white . You 're part dark blood . You 're part like me . I feel that inside me , white boy . I understand it . It makes something special betwixt us , me and you . " " But , York , if you protected me because we both have dark blood , how is it that you still call me white boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how your uncle he answered the captains . He said to them that you loved most of all to be like them , to be American , and that means a white man . So that 's what you are , far as I 'm concerned . And that 's why I call you thataway . You understand that sort of feeling , white boy ? " " Yes , " I said at last , " I think I do , York . " He only nodded and gave me an awkward " good dog " pat on the head . It was all we required between us , York and me . When presently , and without one more word , he arose and trotted soundlessly away down the deck , I understood not only the feeling the giant slave talked of , but also what that feeling meant to him beyond his simple ability to acknowledge or describe . If in Captain William Clark I had found a friend , then in me lonely black York had surely done the same . TEN All next day it rained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscuit late in the afternoon . Captain Clark came at dusk . Ile had no food to offer but the nature of his counsel stirred my numbed spirit to the task of enduring one more night ender the deck canvas . " 1 would suggest , Frank , " he said , " that you be dis- covered ' tomorrow . We 're far enough from La Charrette for you to risk it and , moreover , the problem of getting you food has gotten to be a real chore . " " I 've not complained ! " I said , with some rancor . " I 've not expected you to , " he replied . " All the same you 'll have to come out and take your luck with the rest of the crew . Matters have tightened up for all of us with this poor hunting ashore . I ca n't give you any more time . " " Patron , " I said , " do n't judge me by my bad temper . My eternal gratitude is yours . I would die for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we can use you alive . You write a legible hand in English , do n't you ? " " Why yes , sir , " I said , surprised . " Good . " He smiled . " I had you pegged right . Now , set tight till I discover ' you tomorrow . Be warned , though , I may need to cuff you about a bit to make it look real . " " Patron , " I said feelingly , " I await your blows with keenest pleasure . " He stood up , rearranging the tarpaulin to hide the signs of his visit . " You 're an odd one , Frank , " he said , " and so am I. Happen the wind holds right , we 'll make it there and back together , you and me . " I nodded thankfully , answering , " As my people say , Patron , God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb . ' " I heard his honest quick laugh . " You 're a fair tough lamb , Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need too much sheltering from the elements . " " Find me early , Captain ; this covert stifles me . " This time he did not reply . He had already gone away down the deck , as Indianlike and silent in his elkskin moccasins as any Minnetaree or Teton Sioux . The discovery took place about mid-morning of the next day , May 31st , a Thursday . It had continued to rain steadily the previous night , and a cold wind blew with it . I was ready to be found . Even so , things went chancefully for the redhaired captain and me.  | Clark contrived to work up onto the foredeck , with Captain Lewis and several of the crew in attendance . The pretext was an inspection of that part of the men 's quarters contained below the decked-over prow of the big keelboat . While offering some niggling remarks to the crew about maintaining better order and cleanliness in quarters , Clark suddenly raised his voice . " This bedding is crawling with vermin ! " he declared acusingly . " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean covers . Here , break open this bale of trade blankets . " Ile banged my bale forcefully . " After you 've washed and aired your own bedclothes , you can return the trade blankets as they were . The savages will never know the difference . Step lively , now ! " Again he smacked the tarpaulin over my head , this time with a rousing clout which left my ears ringing . I was still shaking my head , when the crew tore away the canvas and spilled me out upon the deck squarely at the planted feet of Captain Meriwether Lewis . " Good Lord , sir ! " exclaimed Captain William Clark . " It 's the boy from La Charrette ! Blast you , you young whelp ! I told you not to run away from home ! " Before Lewis could rejoin , Clark then seized me in his bearlike grip and boxed me smartly about the head . It required no shamming on my part to howl in good effect . Indeed , my French temper was on the point of warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stepped back . Lewis simply waited without a word . He looked at me and he looked at Clark . He looked around , also , at the gathered crewmen . Finally he was ready . " I do believe , Will , that you are right , " he said . " It is the boy from La Charrette . " Baptiste Deschamps , the burly " patron " of the French boatmen , interjected grinningly . " It is indeed the nephew of Francois Rivet . " " Six days , " put in Captain Clark , wonderingly . " Goodness me , think of him hiding in there all that time ! " " I am thinking of it , " replied Captain Lewis , long face severely set . " How did he eat ? How did he exercise ? Where did he relieve himself ? How did he escape the search of the  | boat at La Charrette ? Oh , I am thinking a great many things about his hiding in there all that time , Captain Clark . You may well believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probing him with his ready-to-pounce attitude . But Clark held fast . " Well now , sir , " he admitted ruefully , " I realize it is all my fault that he is here . I tried to advise him to do the right thing but clearly he misunderstood me . " " Yes , " said Lewis . " Either that , or you did n't set ' on it long enough . " " How 's that , sir ? Set on what ? " " On the idea of dissuading the boy , " replied Lewis evenly . " But then , had you set on it longer , you might have smothered it altogether . The idea , naturally , not the boy . " The two captains stood looking at one another for what seemed to me like five minutes . Then Clark 's sunny grin warmed the situation . " Naturally , Captain , " he said . Lewis ignored him . " Boy , " he barked at me , " we are coming up on those north-bank rapids . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the side the minute we hit wading water . I believe we 'll make you think twice about stowing away . " " Yes sir , Captain , " I said , saluting him smartly . " ' Thank you very much , sir ! " " Get to the rope and stand ready ! " he snapped . " 1 ' 11 have none of your French trickery , you understand ? " " Yes , sir , " I repeated , and went at once to my station . Behind me , the discussion went forward , the switching of the wind bringing it to me . " Well now , " Clark was saying , " what will we do with the boy , Captain ? I mean as to final disposition . " " What do you suggest ? " Lewis demanded quietly . " Well , I 've one idea : since the boy is named for his Uncle Francois , we could simply leave the company roll as it is , with Rivet 's name in place , using young Frank in his stead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " does not adjust all that easily . The very first downriver party we pass , I shall have him transferred to its care . " " But he 's a fine lad , Captain , and will make a good river- man , too . It would be a pity to send him back . I mean , now that he 's come so far and  --  well , you know what I mean , Captain . " Lewis nodded quickly , the quiet voice edged with iron . " Yes , Will , " he said , " I know exactly what you mean . And my decision holds regardless . The boy goes back . " " Damn ! " I heard Captain Clark answer softly , and that was all . The wind drove against us down the river beginning at noon and continuing until 5 P.M. The entire time we hugged the north bank , using the tow . Those of us on the rope were dead with fatigue when Captain Lewis ordered camp at dusk . In such a wind we were helpless to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time supper was done . But no sooner had the wind quit than other trouble blew down the river . It was a party rafting a load of peltries to St. Louis . The patron was French , an agent of Chouteau 's fur company . He had been trapping the past winter on the Grand Osage . His companions on the raft were an Indian man and a squaw . Our American captains bid them all welcome , sharing with them the slender remains of the one deer our hunters had been able to kill . Lewis pounced at once upon the French trapper , plying him with queries about Indian tempers upstream , as well as introducing the matter of carrying me back to La Charrette . Michaud  --  that was his name  --  convinced Lewis soon enough that all reports of poor times with the Indians upriver were well founded . The savages had just burned him out up on the Osage , permitting him to escape with his life only . The Indians did not believe , Michaud said , that the Americans now owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the chilling suggestion that , even should the American expedition get past the Teton Sioux  --  which it would not  --  it would still have waiting for it an even worse chief than the Partisan . This would he Le Borgne , the One-Eyed , headman of the dread A1inne'arees , or Big Bellies . Le Borgne was a half- or quarterbred white who passionately hated the Americans and was  | unquestionably in British pay to guarantee that he continued to hate them . Captains Lewis and Clark had better pray hard to get past the Partisan and then make a deal with the Devil to beat Le Borgne . As for Michaud , he was thankful to have come this far down the river and had no plans whatever for going back up it again next spring . Depressed , Lewis returned to the proposition of freighting the runaway Frank Rivet back as far as La Charrette . Michaud listened , then fastened his dark eyes on me . " Rivet , eh ? " he said . " The nephew of Francois ? The son of Achille ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What news ? " I said bitterly . " That you will gladly agree to transport me back to La Charrette ? " " You 're a Rivet , all right , " Michaud answered . " Just as miserable as your damned uncle . Now , do you wish to hear my news or not ? " " Excuse me . " I bowed . " Is it possible that you speak of good news ? " " It might be , cockerel . That is , were you to silence your Rivet 's tongue long enough for me to divulge it . " I bowed again , and Michaud straightaway told his story . The Indians with him were not Osages but Pawnees . The squaw , She Bear , had been a girlhood friend of my mother . A particular rumor having to do with Achille Rivet , the French husband of my mother , had come down the river on the spring flood . It said that a party of northern Pawnees had traveled to the foot of the Big Rock Mountains , beyond which dwelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen in with some Crows , a tribe known to have intercourse with the Flatheads who , in turn , traded with the Snakes . The Crows said that the Frenchman of the Big River  --  my father  --  was yet alive and being held in the camp of the Shoshone grand chief , Kooskiah . He led a strange life there , it was said . He took no squaw , lived with no warrior , and neither worked for the women of the tribe nor hunted with the men . The Flatheads had wondered at such an odd life in telling the Crows about it . The Crows then added to the mystery in passing the tale along to the Pawnees . And , Michaud now concluded , with  | a shrug of uplifted palms , one might be absolutely certain that the Pawnees had taken nothing from the story in passing along their version of it . " You must be aware , enfant , " he added warningly to me , " that the flavor of such a rumor can not be tasted full strength . Ilowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some reliance . I will not say that Achille resides with this particular band of the Shoshone , nor that he is held by them in any manner peculiar or mysterious . But this I will say : if t h e Indians say that your father is still alive , then you may stake your sacred honor or the virtue of your favorite sister on the fact that he is alive . That is the marrow bone of the story ; that you can suck on . " For a long moment no one about the fire said anything . Captain Lewis stared down at the dirt of the fireside . Captain Clark , who had come up with the two Pawnees , was watching me . The Indians were also studying my face . Michaud , like a true Frenchman , was keeping his attention where it belonged ? on the man who gave the orders and paid the wages of the day  --  he was watching Captain Meriwether Lewis . I also watched the captain , who did not like me . The stillness became undeniably hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Clark . " This does n't change anything , Will , " he said . " We can all understand how young Rivet feels , but we 're many a hundred league from the land of the Shoshone . We ca n't become involved with Indian fables on the way . However , " he amended , eying me , " we share some responsibility for his having come this far . " His intent eyes shifted to meet Clark 's mild ones . " I 'm sure you 'll agree to that , Captain , " he said . " Oh yes , sir , " answered Clark . " It does seem we could have been more careful in our search of the boat at La Cbarrette . I blame myself for that , Captain . " " So do I , " said Lewis . Roth captains exchanged nods , then Lewis continued . " Now then , complicity admitted , " he said , " it becomes our charge to be completely fair in judging his case . I am  | going to give you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got by way of a useful reason for keeping this boy among our ranks ? " Clark scowled and shuffled his feet . I could only suffer through his hesitance and Lewis 's waiting intentness . Finally , Clark bobbed his head awkwardly . " Lacking your own advantages , Captain , " he said , " I thought to have young Frank help me with my entries in the journal . Also , I figure he can keep a journal of his own . You 'll grant that wo n't hurt . After all , we are encouraging the men to keep journals , sir , and to have a truly educated young fellow along to add his to the record  --  mind you , Captain , educated by the Jesuits , and they 're great scholars  --  why that , to me , just makes plain good old-fashioned horse sense . " Lewis nodded dryly . " It might also make just plain good old-fashioned horse feathers , too , " he said . " Go on , Will . " " Well , the boy can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tow rope , hold dead center with a rifle , navigate a bar or a bad bank current and likewise , little doubt , make a steersman soon enough . Further , he 's half horse Indian and we can use that friendly influence ' farther up the stream . His lost father is a legend up where we 're going and the Indians knowing we have along the only son of Achille Rivet will be a factor most favorable to the expedition . Now , what do you say ? " Lewis pursed his thin lips . He never let his narrowed eyes wander from his companion 's ruddy face . " What I say , " he nodded finally , " is why do n't you come out with it honestly , Will ? What 's your real reason for outright lying on behalf of this , well , this extremely dirty , very skinny and , I might say , admirably tough boy ? " Clark shrugged soberly , spreading his bony hands , lowering his rough voice . " Why , Captain , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He moved around the fire and came to stand at my side , putting his arm about my shoulders . Then , straightening , he met the other captain 's gaze .  | " You see , Captain , " he told Lewis , " it 's just that us Americans has got to stick together . " We stayed in that camp another day waiting for the company hunters . Their absence now ran to five days . The captains were concerned about this , as well as the lack of meat so occasioned . Still we all worked . There was cargo to be shifted , trade goods to be aired from the constant rains , poles , paddles , boat hulls to be repaired . Captain Lewis during this time tended to his journal of the expedition . Clark was concerned with the state of the crew and the equipment . In result his own journal was neglected , presenting me with my first opportunity to study his notes . He brought them to me late the second afternoon , saying he thought I might care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done , since he still wanted me to keep my own journal of the adventure . " A young fellow , " he said , " will take a varying view of all these things to that held by older men . A boy 's eyes are less spoiled , Frank . " He paused , looking off up the river , then went on . " When the sergeants and the privates and the captains have set down the field information , folks will still want to know how lovely this great river looked in a billowing spring rain , what the sound of the meadowlark was at sunrise on the far prairie , how sharp fell the bark of the fox or thinly the distant cry of the buffalo wolf , what was the length of Captain Lewis 's nose , how homely was made the face of the other captain , what vast ignorances were his and what small skills , how the grass roared on fire for forty miles around ; folks will  | want to see the haughty stalk of a Sioux war chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashion of the savage dress , they will want to feel the moccasined foot set on earth never trod by white man before  --  ah , lad , there 's no end to the things you can tell in a way we ca n't . " He seemed strangely sad for a moment then , and I took his slim journal from him . " Thank you , Patron , " I murmured . " I shall do my best . " " Your best is what I expect of you , Frank , " he said . He marched off at once in his abrupt , awkward way , and I undid the oiled-silk wrappings of the journal and began to read . At first I was appalled by the crudity of his entries . Then the simple , stark manner in which he expressed himself began to invade my imagination . The man had the freshness of a child , the keen mind of a scholar . He captured a feeling in between these extremes which no educated writer might hope to approach . Consider this sample in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's near-disastrous passage of the Devil 's Raceground : May 24th Thurs. 1804 ... Passed a verry bad part of the River Called the Deavel 's Raceground , this is where the Current Sets against some projecting rocks for half a Mile on the ** . Side , passed a Isld. in a verry bad part of the river . We attempted to pass up under the LBd . Bank which was falling in so fast that the evident danger obliged its to cross between the Starbd . Side and a Sand bar in the middle of the river , We hove up near the head of the Sand bar , the Same moving &; backing caused us to run on the sand . The Swiftness of the Current Wheeled the boat , Broke our toe rope , and was nearly over setting the boat , all hands jumped out on the upper Side and bore on that Side untill the Sand washed from under the boat and Wheeled on the next bank by the time She wheeled a 3rd time got a rope fast to her Stern and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stern was down whilst in the act of Swinging a third time into Deep Water near the  | Shore , we returned to the Island where we Set out and assended under the Bank which I have just mentioned as falling in ... . Well , there it was . All of the meat with no fat . Captain Clark put down only those things which had honest meaning to him . He was the riverman of the two captains , Lewis for the main part traveling ashore to help with the hunting , selection of campsites , and the like . As well , it was Lewis 's province to make and set down the bulk of the scientific information gathered . Clark 's journal , by contrast , was as bare of concern for flora or fauna as any oceangoing master 's log . Shifting channels , snags , sandbars , setsof-current , feet-of-draft , there were the matters of front rank with the red-haired captain . Yet he had this art wherein what he did say of other things carried a peculiar impact . And his rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudest hour of my life . Nor was I ever deceived by the real nature of his work . I was a headstrong half-breed , hot-blooded , rebellious , vain , callow . As such , I was scarcely given to deeper considerations of philosophy and the orderly progression of the universe . Yet , even though I was the tool of these varied lacks , I still knew which way to spit on a windy day . Crude , unfinished , barely literate they may have been ; I realized the true character of those notes beneath my hand . I was holding history in my lap . The journal of Captain Clark was swiftly replaced by an oar on the keelboat . This proved work to break the back of a  | giant . The two days required to go on up to the mouth of the Osage pushing the fifty-five-foot barge loaded with thousands of pounds of trade goods against a twenty-mile downriver wind had me at exhaustion 's edge . The second night Captain Clark tended my blistered hands , assuring me that I , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his medicines were small solace . It was meat that I needed , and that we all needed . One may imagine the joy , then , with which the hungry crew greeted a distant hail across the river from George Drewyer and John Shields whose two packhorses were loaded with game . It turned out they had seven deer . As we prepared and ate these , Captain Clark went among the men urging them to wait until the meat was cooked through , this to avoid the " venison blues , " a treacherous disorder of the bowel brought on by underdone deermeat . But the others were the same as I. They would not delay and so gorged themselves and were sore and sorry for the following week . But such was the esprit of these hardy rascals . They simply did not care . They were consumed by the fever of the Louisiana adventure and were , to the last veteran army private and hard-bitten French boatman , carefree as boys . Looking at them , I was stirred in soul to be of their number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total were young Americans from Kentucky . Fourteen were soldiers in the United States Army , volunteers every one , sworn to serve to the death . There were two French rivermen , " water masters " by rating , who supposedly knew each whim and whirlpool of the Missouri , these being Peter Cruzatte and Francis Labiche . Among the soldiers were three sergeants , Ordway , Pryor and Floyd , the last-named a very fine fellow to whose mess Captain Clark had assigned me . Additionally , there was Corporal Richard Warfington and his squad of six men doing guard duty to get the expedition past the Teton Sioux . Lastly , there was the black York and the ten French boatmen , myself among the latter , hired to go only so far as the Mandan country . This was the whole of the Lewis and Clark party .  | It was not much of a host with which to strike against an untracked enemy wilderness . Yet , glancing about the firelit sandy beach of the great river , seeing those fearless laughing faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolfed their half-cooked meat and scalding coffee , a boy of eighteen , even with raw hands and an aching spine , must thrill to his romantic core with the knowledge that he was accepted by such men as one of them . That boy must know , too , that mere numbers presented no handicap where such character and boldness existed . If any men alive could win through to the headwaters of the mighty Columbia River ? could beat the British in Captain Clark 's boat race to the Pacific sea  --  then it was these men who were my comrades on that lonely beach . Full of good red meat in mind and body , I reclined gratefully against a driftlog . All was right within my world . Somewhere far up the Missouri beyond the Big Rock Mountains waited Achille Rivet . With the help and sympathy of these brave comrades , and the sufferance of their two captains , I would find my father and bring him home . Together we would live in this new land , bringing greater luster to the family name with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and would honor our place in this great new Louisiana . We would be Americans of the first order . That history which I had held in my hands two nights before returned now with intensified power . I could sense it all around me . It was in the dance of the flames , the shine of the men 's eyes , the flush of their faces , the hush of the low words of the captains querying the returned hunters , in the smell of the strong black coffee , the wondrous odors of the shag-leaf tobacco , the lap and soft singing of the river upon the sandy beach . It was in every fiber of that early summer night there at the mouth of the Osage River . God was good . This was living . Stand aside , History , make room for Francois Achille Rivet ! Sweet Mary , what excitement ! What fearful happiness ! What blind luck ! Well , perhaps . But the truth was that Cedar Island lay  | still 38o leagues up the Grand Missouri . The deadly Teton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked Partisan and cruel Le Borgne dwelled still a hundred days and more to the north . The truth was , we were but eighty-seven miles by water from my uncle 's house in La Charrette . I made hasty truce with this depressing reality . In less than a full minute I dismissed the business of the small distance from home . Pahl Why be modest ? I had made a superb start . Be of grateful heart and clear mind , I told myself . With these gallant companions of fellow French and American blood you are about to embark upon the great hour of your life . Bless the good God , Frank Rivet , and go to sleep . What a poor fool I was . That night on the sandy shore where we ate the burned-raw venison and joked of beating the British to the Columbia , I envisioned a dashing attack up the river . In this gallant run , we would virtually fly to the villages of the Mandan , gliding along like racing sculls . Nothing mundane would deter us , no natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red-haired captain himself named it a boat race ? Well , it was the devil of a race . To make of it anything romantic would be quixotic . Oh , Floyd was good to nie , and York , when he might leave off his employment as Clark 's shadow , was similarly kind . But Baptiste Deschamps treated me poorly , being jealous of my family 's reputation on the river . Neither did he permit me to forget that my mother had been a Pawnee . And Lewis , as a matter of course , was Lewis . He never gave me a friendly look or word after the brief clash with Clark in which it was decided I might stay with the company . The greatest disillusionment of all , however , was my red-headed benefactor . Clark , while he always had a smile for me when our paths crossed , seemed otherwise to have disowned me . He even assigned me to the white pirogue of Corporal Warfington , thus separating me from the keelboat and himself . His excuse was that Warfington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his craft , and that was myself . " You are to see , lad , " he told me simply , " that the white pirogue gets up the river every bit as handily as the red . " By " the red " he meant the French pirogue of Baptiste Deschamps . He was thus pitting me directly against the patron of the boatmen , which of course did little to enrich my relationship with that fiery , vain riverman . But , as the French say , " Speak of the devil and his horns will appear . " So I did what I might to stay with Deschamps and the red pirogue , while still not exaggerating the unfairness of the match from my viewpoint . One must bear this frustration in mind . The story of interminable travail which composed the next sixteen weeks of our race against time was a hell of exhaustion . My labors to keep the white pirogue abreast of the red one continued from dawn to dusk . My every instant upon the river , my each moment in camp ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Captain Lewis was watching me . One faux pas , one error in judgment , one mistake with a snag or sandbar , and I was finished . If the white pirogue went down , I went down with it , for there remained no human doubt that Captain Lewis would send me rafting homeward on the next passing logfloat of French furs should I blunder in the trust Captain Clark had given me . Here , then , is Frank Rivet , half-breed steersman for the white pirogue of Corporal Richard Warfington , reporting on the remaining 38o leagues to Teton River and the land of the Sioux . The company is a scanty crew of hardy paladins dispatched across the wide and wild Missouri by the American President Thomas Jefferson . The official name of the company is The Corps of Volunteers for Northwestern Discovery . The view is over the shoulder , as it were , of this great patriot leader and his two incomparable captains . They , and the forty-three other soldier and civilian minions of destiny serving under them . And especially of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could neither spell nor punctuate nor pose a pretty phrase , but whose sense of  | life was faultless and whose faith in half-breed French and Pawnee boys was total . We left the sand beach camp at six o'clock the morning of Tuesday , June 5 , 1804 , having first jerked the venison we had not consumed . About mid-morning , at a creek showing on our charts as Little Manitou , Captain Clark spied some fine beds of what he called " wild creases or tung grass , " but which were ordinary water cress . Nothing would do for him , however , but that York and I , the prize swimmers , should breast out to the bar and fetch back a sufficient quantity of the greens for all three company messes . We did it and nearly drowned for our heroics . The proposition of swimming across an eight-mile current pushing a soggy raft of wet vegetables hardly represents sober judgment . Nevertheless , the feat served to gain me a new name , " Muskrat , " and to raise me a little in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was two hours behind with the white pirogue , Clark sent York to see what my trouble might be . It was only some broken paddles , so York then said his master had told him that if the cause of the delay was not too serious he , York , should take me and scout the country by land . Our captain , it seemed , was curious to see to what extent my Pawnee blood might demonstrate itself effective ; by which he meant effective in finding signs of other Indians . York was a known scenthound at this work but , to my considerable pride , it was I who first found the track of the redmen going along the right-hand bank . My huge companion at once grunted , " How many of them ? " and I studied the trail  | and replied , " Ten , " which was exactly equal to his own count . York , however , confounded me by reading further that the Indians were all males and dressed for war . I immediately scowled that there was small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Come along , white boy . " We set out directly inland and in half an hour came up behind a rise and saw , beyond it , our band of Indians . There were ten of them and they were all warriors and all painted for war . To cover my chagrin I made some show of identifying them as Sauks , adding that undoubtedly they were bound on a raid against the Usages , their historic enemies , with a view to stealing some of the traditionally fine Osage horses . This impressed York who , as I have remarked , was of but simple mind . The larger art remained his , however , since he had impressed me and I had rather a keen intellect  --  well , at least keen enough to keep my tongue in my head upon our return to camp , permitting York to report our adventure . In this way I gained additional repute with my fellows through bridling my metis tendency to gild the pill , as the French say . Early on Saturday , June gth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor snag to begin with . This was at that place which Monsieur Loisel had called Prairie of Arrows . Getting the big boat off in an hour , we forged ahead , but shortly the main channel narrowed to funnel the entire tide of the Missouri into a constricted bore only 300 yards wide . The roar of the trapped flood was paralyzing . Before Captain Clark could cry out to his steersman , the keelboat struck a major snag  --  a great submerged deadhead  --  and swung herself broadside to the hammer of the raging current . Moreover , as she swung to , her lower side hit yet a third snag and her planking was stove in . She began at once to take water . Coming up just then with the white pirogue , I guided her into the lee of the keelboat and my crew leaped out to aid the other crew in heaving the heavier craft free of the menace , myself going aboard the barge to take her abandoned helm . With luck , and Captain Clark yelling me on , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounding on the right bank , so preventing her from foundering in deep water . Re- pairs proved not difficult and we made several more miles easily . That night Captain Clark came to Floyd 's mess and announced loudly enough for all hands to hear , " That was quick work on the snag today , Frank ; you 're a real Rivet . " I slept that night the soundest I had since La Charrette . With a favoring breeze , the sails set , and some timely poling , too , we did well until noon on June izth . At dinner that day two rafts came down the river . One was loaded with peltries , one with antelope tallow and bear lard . We purchased 300 pounds of the combined greases , a most welcome addition to our diet , but the real surprise was to find that the Frenchmen had with them old Mr. Dorion . This was of course that same fabled Pierre Dorion of whom I had heard since earliest childhood . The old gentleman was a St. Louis trader . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Ile was experienced with the Sioux in particular , having married a woman of the Yankton tribe and had by her a half-breed son , also called Pierre . The elder Dorion was reputed to be a violently dishonest rascal , a charge common in a trade where the richest fur merchant was most often he who got first to the most traps , his own or those of his competitors . His detractors insisted , also , that his success with the feared Sioux was due to his own implacable hatred and bad treatment of his fellow whites . But I still found old Mr. Dorion completely enchanting . Captain Clark agreed . He said the old man 's reputation was attributable to his courage . He would not be bullied nor buffaloed by the savages , and that was the deciding secret , said Clark , of dealing with them . Only stand hard and stand fast , advised our captain , and the Indians would never harm you . Take one step backward and it was all over ; they would overwhelm you . I naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this regard what a thrill it was when old Dorion told me he had known Achille Rivet and that he and my father had been freres de lait , foster brothers , for many years . What an added thrill subsequently when the doughty old  | trader said that he would accede to Captain Lewis 's invitation to accompany the expedition back up the river . This was , as well , a crowning stroke for Lewis . Old Dorion had spent twenty winters in the Teton Nation and might succeed where Clark and Lewis never could , in getting some of the hostile chiefs to travel to Washington to visit their great father , ( ' resident Jefferson . En tout , what a day this one was . From that camp we worked the river like draft animals the next four days . The fifth day , June 17th , being Sunday , we were finally allowed some rest . I had the chance once more of studying Clark 's journal and should like to enter here the irrirnitable text of his notes for that Sabbath Day : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile &; came too to make ores , repair our cable &; toe rope &c.; &c.; Which was necessary for the Boat and Perogues , Sent out Sjt . Pryor and Some men to get ash timbers for the ores , and Set some men to make a Toe Rope out of the Cords of a Cable which had been provided by Capt . Lewis at Pittsburg for the Cable of the Boat . George Drewyer our hunter and one man came in with 2 Deer &; a Bear , also a young Hourse , they had found in the Prarie , this horse has been left by Some war party against the Osage . This is the Crossing place for the war parties against that nation from the Saukees Sauks Aiaouez Iowas &; Souix . The party is much afflicted with Boils , and several have the Deassentary , which I contribute to the water . The Countrey about this place is butifull on the river rich &; well timbered on the S.S. about two miles back a Prarie coins which is rich and interspursed with groves of timber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further hack and is rolling , on the L.S. , the high lands and Prarie corns. in the bank of the river continus back , well watered and abounds in Deer Elk &; Bear . The Ticks &; Musquiters are verry troublesom .. . His final line puts the finger squarely upon the sore point of the entire circumstance . All of us might forget a variety of things about that camp , but none of us would forget the  | " Ticks &; Musquiters " found there . Neither before nor after did we encounter such magnificent insects . The crawlers were as large and ill-tempered as wharf rats , the flying species of a size and disposition to shame harpy eagles . Wednesday , July 4 , 1804 , was the Independence Day of the Americans . Captain Lewis celebrated it with the issue of an extra gill of whiskey per man ; also , by loading and firing our four small swivel cannon which , along with Captain Lewis 's unique " air gun , " comprised the major dosage of our " big medicine " for impressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was far more impressed by the bonus whiskey , becoming sick as a dog from it . I had veteran company here , Private Hall getting fifty lashes for stealing whiskey , Private Collins one hundred lashes for being drunk on post and abetting the theft . Private Joseph Fields got himself bitten by a very large rattlesnake , as well , but was so thoroughly saturated with the spirits that he not only survived easily but felt much better than I next morning . In three more days we reached the mouth of the Nodaway River . One man was taken down with sunstroke . Captain Clark bled him and treated him with compound of niter . The heat by this time was monstrous . It was the very belly of summer and all suffered unspeakably . Yet no man complained . The country , meanwhile , became lovely . Timber , grassland , winding waters , gentle hills , dipping vales , noble expanses of handsome prairie met the eye continually . But there were other moments . On Saturday , July 14th , as we toiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in upon us from the north . The wind came screaming out of it and Hell itself struck us . For forty minutes we fought to keep the canvas drawn over the cargo lockers to prevent blowing water from filling the boats and sending them to the bottom . Yet , when the storm passed , it did so all in an instant . The whole of the river and all of the air above and about it lay like a plate of flat glass , soundless as some outer planet . In another week we came to the mouth of the great River Platte . Old Mr. Dorion told us that the Sioux call this the  | river which is " ten miles wide and two inches deep . " At its confluence , Captain Clark announced a layover of several days , since the French pirogue had shipped a good deal of water in getting past the Platte 's shallow bar and her cargo must he unpacked and aired . I n making the initial announcement , Clark looked squarely at inc . " Tomorrow , " he then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest to you all the wisdom of remembering that firmly . Frank , " he added acridly , " do n't we French ' have a saying for such admonishments ? " I thought , or tried to think , swiftly . He knew I had deliberately fouled Baptiste Deschamps and the red pirogue. lle was letting me know that my youth and natural exuberance to outshine the noted " Big Bat " in the management of my craft would serve once , and once only , to protect me from summary discipline . Yet , so kind was this gruff , soft-hearted bear of a man that he could not bring himself to humble even a lowly metis riverboy in front of his grown-up French peers . He was warning me over their heads while at the same time letting us all know that horseplay at work had that day enjoyed its last exercise among the Corps of Volunteers . I straightened , facing him . " Yes , sir , Captain , " I answered . " I think that we do have such a saying  --  A word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed me but the frost was gone from the homely , hard-weathered face . " Good , " he said , " very good , " and strode away . That night when I went to my blankets they did not want me . Something , my French conscience , my Pawnee pride , the constant eerie howling of the wolves which infested the Platte , would not permit sleep . First light was coming gray in the east when finally I did drift off . Two days later Cruzatte and Drewyer , sent forward to find the local Oto Indians for the first important meeting of the American captains with upriver redmen , returned nonplused . They had located the big Oto town but no people were in it . Seemingly they had fled in our advance . Clark and Lewis began worried talks to decide the next course . For  | another day we waited . One man fell ill with an infected tumor on his breast . These fetid boils had been our most trying health problem the entire way . Captain Clark treated them with a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one defied the medication . When eventually pierced by the captain 's lancet , it spewed over a pint of vile fluid , but the man mended rapidly . I do not know if the Pawnee blood was responsible , but I had had none of these tumors , nor any heat sickness , nor any of the other camp disorders of the whites , including the mysterious sudden rheumatism which strangely crippled our strongest comrades . Captain Clark told me that the Americans had a saying for such immunity ? " Where there 's no sense , there 's no feeling . " He grinned , but I knew he intended only to be kind and cheerful . Another three days passed in the rest camp with no news of the Otos . The fourth morning Captain Lewis dispatched La Liberte , one of the French boatmen familiar with this stretch of the Missouri , to locate the Indians and bring them in for council . I disliked this La Liberte . He had a bad eye , was sullen , and a known " squaw-chaser . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3o , 18o4 . It marked , as well , the resumption of our slowed journey upstream . We did not go far . The early camp permitted another chance to consult Clark 's journal , now become a combined document of both captains and hence of doubled interest . The entry for this day was Clark 's , and unquestionably Clark 's : ... Set out this morning early . . . Came too and formed a Camp , intending to waite the return of the frenchman &; Indians . . . posted out our guard and . . . Captn . Lewis &; I went up the Bank and walked a Short Distance in the high Prarie . . . the most butifull prospect of the River up &; Down and the Countrey Opsd. prosented it Self which I ever beheld . . . Joseph Fields Killed and brought in an Anamale Called by the French Brarow blaireau , badger and by the Panies Pawnees Cho car tooch this Anamale Burrows in the Ground and  | feeds on Flesh Bugs &; Vigatables his Shape &; Size is like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dogs with Short Ears , his Tail and Hair like that of a Ground Hog , and longer ; and lighter . his Interals like the interals of a flog . . . Jo . &.; R. Fields did not return this evening , Several men with verry bad boils . Catfish is cought in any part of the river . Turkeys &; Geese &; a Beaver Killed &; Cought everything in prime order men in high Spirits , a fair Still evening Great numbers Musquiters .. . Thus , Captain Clark proved once more peculiarly able to capture the heart of our predicament , describing perfectly the interminable minutiae which impeded our race for the upper river . But as dark came at last and the fires died away that quiet Monday , there was some apprehension mounting in the camp . La Liberte was still missing and there had been no sign of the Indians he had been sent to find . Had they , instead , found him ? La Liberte was still missing . Was he a deserter ? Another man disappeared . Moses Reed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , did not return . Were these the first defections ? Three days later , at the morning roll call , August 7th , Captain Meriwether Lewis read solemn notice that the men La Liberte and Moses B. Reed be thereby declared deserters . Ile dispatched Drewyer , Fields , Bratten and Labiche to find the stragglers . The orders were to put Reed to death if he  | resisted , he being a soldier of the American Army . La Liberte , being merely a French engage , was to be put in arrest and returned for questioning . The first uneasiness developed among us . The summary order to execute one of our comrades came as harsh reminder to us all that we had come a far journey to this camp at Council Bluff . When I later wondered aloud to York if Captain Lewis really would have Reed shot , the big slave told me soberly , " Yes , sir , Mister Frank , he will do it , absolutely sure . " The ensuing eight days we continued slowly up the river , our scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher up . An early camp was made August 15th , no word having come from the scouts . While we waited , Mr. Dorion regaled us with tales of the notorious Chief Blackbird , former Grand Chief of all the Omahas , and a river pirate even greater than Le Borgne or the Partisan . In fact , said Mr. Dorion , the Omahas under Blackbird were a tribe which had invented the game of stopping upriver parties and demanding tribute of them . The old Frenchman suggested that the chief 's name ought to have been Blackmail , rather than Blackbird , but that in either event the smallpox had taken care of him , along with his entire nation . It was a fearsome thing , Dorion told us , when the dread " spotted sickness " was among the Omahas . The Indians developed such a frenzy from the fatal nature of the illness that they not only burned their villages and all their belongings , including their ponies and dogs , but also put to death in the most violent and terrible ways their children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together again in the " better country beyond . " Mr. Dorion insisted they lost 400 people , enough to ruin them and allow the Teton Sioux to take over their power and become the dominant tribe below the Mandans . Late that afternoon an immense wall of fire sprang up in the grass west of the river . Dorion advised Captain Lewis that the blaze was likely set by some parties of Sioux which he had been expecting on this part of the river . It was their  | way of signaling their presence . Since Clark was absent scouting for the Omahas , Lewis decided to send the old squawman toward the prairie fire to determine if he might find his friends , the Yanktons . All this talk of the Sioux affected the men . I myself was still awake in my blankets at midnight . So were the others . 1 could hear them talking softly in the night . Yet two long days of further waiting produced no Indians . Neither the Sioux nor the Omahas nor the Otos came in to talk . Mr. Dorion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Clark came back to admit the same thin luck with the Omahas . Lewis was visibly upset , knowing that the meetings with these tribes were a vital part of our instructions , yet realizing full well that we could not wait forever to bring them about . Some last-minute excitement stirred as we were cleaning up the supper things . Francis Labiche , of the party sent in search of the deserters , arrived in camp . He said the arrest party was close behind him with M. B. Reed , but that La Liberte had deceived them and gotten away . As Captain Lewis queried Labiche , the entire company roused up and gathered quietly around . They were waiting for the party to come in with Reed . A certain nervousness spread . When the party came at last , Reed was white as a sheet . The men of my mess , like those of the other two messes , stood watching him intently . There was no accusation in their glances , nor any morbid curiosity , nor censure of any kind . These men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . The trial of Reed began Saturday , August i8 , 18o4 . The prisoner requested steadily enough that the captains be as favorable to him as they might , consistent with their oaths as officers . This they were , considering that death might easily have been the reward of the fugitive . He was compelled , instead , to run the gauntlet four times , the company being armed with nine-switches for striking him on each course . He  | was then dishonorably discharged and ordered treated in all ways as no longer a member of the party . Since it was Captain Lewis 's birthday , and had been a trying experience for the entire crew , the day was closed with the issue of an extra gill of whiskey for all hands and a rousing company dance resulted which went on until 11 P.M. The long-sought Oto Indian party surprised us next day by appearing out of nowhere ready to talk . The Grand Chief was given a state breakfast with our captains while his scabrous subjects waited gloweringly . They were an abject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or verminous buffalo robes . Captain Clark spoke for our side , as generally , when the business was with redmen . They referred to him at once as the Red Head Chief , a name which stuck to him in all our travels . When the two parties had orated back and forth , each of the Indians was presented with a President Jefferson medal of the second grade  --  Lewis had three grades of this award  --  and a peace paper which stated the red bearer was of meek and pacifistic intentions and recognized the President of the United States as his new father . The Grand Chief was last to receive his paper . He looked at it , sneered haughtily , handed it back to Clark . This was the testing of our nerve , the hard bluff which our captain had warned of earlier . In response to it now , Clark took the certificate and tore it into small pieces under the Indian 's nose . This mightily disconcerted the fellow . At once he wanted another certificate , but Clark had grown cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drewyer , he informed the chief in very rough terms that he was a liar , a cheat , a woman in his heart and had for his goal in the talks , goods , and not good intentions . At this , the rest of the Indians commenced to inflate their chests and stiffen their spines . Our soldier guard quietly , but ostensibly , put their rifles on the cock . This action produced a sharp clicking noise , most distinctive in character . The redmen did not seem to care for it . They moved back quite suddenly away from Clark , who now made a show of generosity by bestowing another cer- tificate upon the Grand Chief . He then had the air gun fired , presented a bottle of whiskey to the subchiefs and bid the whole shabby conclave an abrupt good afternoon . The Indians left on the double and before the Red Head Chief might again change his mind and start tearing up their peace papers . Later that evening , with dramatic , great pain , Sergeant Floyd collapsed . Captain Clark came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote , " Sgt. Floyd is taken verry bad all at once with a Biliose Chorlick . . . we attempt to relieve him without success as yet . . . he gets worse and we are - much allarmed at his Situation . . . all attention to him . " The attention failed . Floyd alternately flushed and chilled . The pain in his right side became terrible . About 4 A.M. he said that something inside of him had " give way . " Clark thought he slept , but it was coma . By a little after daybreak he was dead . The captain was much shaken . He said there was no understanding it . When we buried brave Floyd and left him there , we saw something we would not see again  --  Captain Clark weeping . Bitter days of progress followed . The work of poling the heavy-laden craft up the constantly shallowing channel , taken with the unbelievable August heat , crippled our strongest boatmen . Blind loops , dead-end sloughs and shoaly rapids battered our courage . The buffalo gnats , mosquitoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We came , on the sixth of these hellish days , to a brooding lone mountain in the level plain , Spirit Mound , a sacred place greatly feared by the Indians . We were here , Captain Clark said , on the southern edges of the Dakotahs , in the Vermilion River country , an awesomely empty realm . For eleven days more we forged doggedly on . Each league now brought us closer to that dread part of the river we all knew of but did not talk about . On August 27th we went by the mouth of the James River . Here it appeared that Shannon had become lost , having been many days absent . The Irishman and I had become fast friends . He was the best educated of the army enlistees and we had enjoyed many a debate on Aristotle , the decline of the Romans , Hannibal and the Alps and all those elephants , and other privileged topics  | of the learned . I would surely miss old Shannon had he in truth gone under . But we pressed on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the disappearance of Shannon , Captain Clark once more took me under his personal direction . Tutelage , he called it , but it was more akin to bondage . He put me with his own mess , while leaving me to work the white pirogue . " I warned you , " he reminded me when I complained , " that it would not be so easy ; that you would take that white craft to the villages of the Mandan in a pace with Deschamps and the Frenchmen in the red . You will do it , too , but meanwhile you can eat with me and soak up a little something about these pesky Tetongues we shall soon be passing through . " I knew full well who he meant  --  the Teton Sioux  --  but I made no answer beyond a careful nod . " They 're bad Indians , Frank , " he continued . " Captain Lewis and me were given to understand by Mr. Jefferson that they have as good as shut off the Upper Missouri to our St. Louis traders . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I indicated this was previously clear to me , and inquired uneasily what instructions the President had given them about easing the British-Sioux stranglehold . Clark shrugged . " Bust it wide open , that 's all . Oh , Mr. Jefferson likewise expects us to rig up a lasting peace amongst the Sioux and the other tribes , but that 's for certain  --  how do you say it , Frank ? dorez luh pullet ' ? " " Dorer la pilule  --  gilding the pill , " I replied . " Yes , that 's it . Well , no matter , we 'll manage the main part , and that 's to let the Tetongues know who 's the new boss up here , peaceable or powderburnt . You got any doubts you want to get shut of , boy ? On that subject , I mean . I 've noted you looking a lot behind you of late . " I began gratefully to unburden my several fears and wearinesses , but was granted no real chance to get started . Interrupting our talk , Captain Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that same night sending old Mr.  | Dorion in secret to find a band of Teton Sioux rumored to be encamped on the James River " not too far . " Clark responded that he was not satisfied how far " not too far " was , and so he believed that he would double the night guard until he could make up his mind . Captain Lewis did not appear to think that at all a bad idea , and neither did Frank Rivet . There was something about the sound of those words Teton Sioux and not too far . Two nights later old Dorion came back . He had with him seventy warriors and five chiefs of the Yankton , not Teton , band of the Sioux tribe . This was his wife 's band and , to my delighted surprise , he brought with him his half-breed son . I could scarcely contain my desire to speak with the young fellow but , when finally I did capture him apart , he stared a hole through me , wheeled about , and stalked off dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Clark , standing near by , moved to my side . " Do n't make more of it than it amounts to , Frank , " he advised sympathetically . " But that 's just it ! " I protested . " I 'm not ! He 's a half-breed just like me ! " " No , " said Clark , " that 's where you make your mistake . He 's a half-breed , all right , but not just like you . He 's been raised by his mother 's people . " " Well , where 's your great difference in that , Patron ? " " Just this ; young Dorion 's a Sioux , you 're a settlement boy . " I shook my head , bewildered . Clark put his hand to my shoulder .  | " Frank , " he said , " you suckle a wolf cub on settlement milk , he 'll grow up to wag his tail . You raise him on his wild mother 's milk , he 'll rip your throat out . You 've been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now . Do n't fret it , though ; you 're with the right tribe , boy . " When he said that , gave my shoulder a final rough squeeze and walked on to join Lewis and the Yanktons , I nearly wept . I knew that it was n't the entire truth he spoke . Yet , even so , Captain William Clark had just said that I was a white man , among fellow white men , and for that gentle twisting of the facts I loved him . In the council which followed , the Yanktons complained about the cheapness of the St. Louis traders in contrast with the British factors of Assiniboine River , Turtle Mountain and the other Hudson 's Bay and North West Company posts . But they agreed instantly , upon gifts of tobacco , glass beads , Jefferson medals , American flags and peace papers  --  but mainly of good old tin cups full of whiskey  --  to trade with the St. Louis merchants and to make and keep peace " forever " with all their Indian neighbors . This making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " as the saying went , Captain Lewis had grand hopes for their example serving us with their even fiercer Teton cousins . He was especially heartened when old Mr. Dorion proved agreeable to conducting three of the Yankton chiefs back down the river to talk peace with the main Otos and Omahas and then go on with them to Washington to " see their great new father . " But Captain Clark grinned his wise grin and said to me that night at mess , " Do n't you put a penny on those rascals , Frank ; they took no salt with their meat . They wo n't be bound by anything agreed to in this council , and that peace treaty , therefore , simply ai n't worth its salt . " We went on from that camp of August 29th and the dubious Yankton council with an increased sense of urgency . On September 4th we passed the mouth of the Niobrara River . On the seventh we saw the first large towns of prairie dogs , or " barking squirrels , " as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " wild goats , " or antelopes , and the  | first of the really vast herds of the hump-shouldered " curly cows , " the buffalo . Indeed , the land now swarmed with game of every kind . I I u n is n news , and very good news , too , intruded briefly the morning of September uth ; George Shannon walked into camp hale and fit . He and I at once got off on a rousing debate over high and low Latin , my spirits soaring no little . Four days thence we reached the White River , the next main stream , save one , below the Teton . All of the afternoon we poled the boats past the cliffs of a long and lofty escarpment following the Missouri in stunning grandeur for many miles . This formation was the great Pine Ridge , Captain Clark informed me , and said that it was the geographical division between the Upper and Lower Missouri countries . " Yes , " I nodded uneasily , " it even feels different up here than down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled soberly . " It is another land , " he said . " This is the first of the real horse Indian country , Frank ; your mother 's land . " " It 's wild-looking , " I muttered , shivering for no good cause . " God 's name , but it is lonesome and wild-looking . " Clark studied me carefully , then said in his quiet-voiced way , " It 's nothing , Frank , to where we 're going ... " The singular warning with which he heralded the approaches to my mother 's land proved again the peculiar presciences which were Captain William Clark 's . From the White River camp , the whole air of the adventure seemed to alter itself . A loneliness which ached in its immensity replaced the rich beauty of the lower river . The stapes of plain and prairie in this higher , drier land ran off to infinity . The game remained abundant but far more restive . Like the landscape the animals appeared to recede into the hazy distances , incalculable as to number but vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass thinned beneath a prickly rash of opuntia cactus . Limestone gave way to slate , and slate to clay . The color of the prairie faded from bright green to gray-blue at the sudden , dominant appearance of the true short grama , or buffalo grass .  | The river ran through this silent void between banks so pillared and perfectly sculptured that Captain Lewis actually considered them the possible masterworks of some vanished race of pre-Indian humanity . The total effect , always , remained that of the strangely hushed stillness . It was as though our keelboat and two pirogues with their cargoes of human souls did not move or breathe but were painted there forever motionless and moribund among the raw and glaring pigments of some enormous canvas . At the same time we suffered upon the river every example of accident native to such travel . Whatever could happen to ship or sail , helm , oar , pole , keel , towrope or other trapping , did happen . We were five whole days coming from White River to the fabled Grand Detour , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty miles twice reverses the direction of its flow . It was , indeed , the twentieth of September and almost dark when we made our camp on a willow bar midstream of the main channel . Here we lay just below the Detour . We lay , as well , and by virtue of Captain Clark 's never-ending vigilance , safely out of Indian reach of either shore . Being this past week 's march by water nearer the boundaries of the Teton Sioux and not having seen a living soul , white or Indian , the entire time , our nerves were understandably on set-triggers . The night guard was posted double strength . Sleep came late and of a sketchy , restless kind . An hour and a half after midnight , the Sergeant of the Guard came running from the head of the island . At the same time the keelboat , upon which I was sleeping with Captain Clark and six crew members , began to rock in a most alarming manner . Following the captain , I went over the side into the shallows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermining , " the guard shouted . " The current has raised and reversed its set and is cutting the island out from under us ! " " Frank , " ordered Clark , wheeling upon me calm as the sunrise " you must get your white pirogue off her beaching , or she will go under when the island caves . Warn Deschamps and  | the Frenchmen , also . Both pirogues must be off in five minutes . " " Yes , sir , " I answered , and dashed to apprise Big Bat of the situation . There was every certainty , as confirmed in Captain Clark 's journal , that all three boats would have been lost to the huge suction of the dissolving sand had we been a minute less swift in getting them away . As it was , we were forced to make camp on the opposite bank for the remainder of the night . It was a nervous remainder , but nothing disturbed the morning peacefulness save the wailing of the wolves . Daylight revealed we had stopped in an oasis of loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , towering zoo and more feet above the water , framed the river upstream . On either side of the channel , sloping to infinity east and west , the earth was a soft green inclined plain upon which incredible numbers of antelope , elk and buffalo were feeding in mixed herds . The air , inland , was full of the song and flight movement of the grouse , lark , pigeon and prairie hen , while on the river countless thousands of waterfowl rafted , filling the ear with their eerie honking cries . Everywhere the ubiquitous gray , red , black , brown and white small wolves of the prairie trotted , sat on their haunches , or lolled about panting hungrily . Amid all this tapestry of ardent life , the overwhelming sense of allengulfing loneliness remained . We traveled hard that day and in the afterpart of it came up to a high-banked island . It was some mile and a half in length , crowned with a shaggy flat-leafed conifer with which I was not familiar . Captain Clark , Lewis being ahead of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this island for some reason not apparent to me . He had himself , York and I landed from the white pirogue on the lower side , where he bade Warfington and the boat crew to await our return . We three then climbed the ridge of the island to a lookout point on the upstream side . There , below us , in a sort of half-moon bay , lay an abandoned trading post surrounded by a stark phalanx of long vacant Sioux lodges . The post itself was of logs built behind a barricade of more legs set on end in the earth . It was  | the first stockaded fort I had seen , and I began to tremble with excitement . " I wanted you to see it , Frank , " said Clark , low-voiced , " before the others did . " He turned to point at the dark conifers all about us . " Do you know what sort of trees these are ? " he asked . And , then , when I had dumbly shaken my head , he replied softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sank into me slowly , but it sank deeply , compounding my unnamed excitement . " Nom de Dieu ! " I whispered . " Cedar Island  --  we 've come to it at last ! " " We have , " said Clark . " That is the house of Regis Loisel down there , and those are the bones of the Teton Sioux camp which surrounded him last winter . It hits you a little cold in the belly , do n't it , boy ? " " Yes , sir , " I gulped . " One gets the distinct feeling that Monsieur Loisel was fortunate to get out alive . " " Agreed , " said the rawboned captain , fixing me with his eyes . " A man can smell the death smell down there . " Again he paused , watching me closely . " You still think you want to go on , lad ? To keep looking for your father deeper and deeper into a land like this ? Think hard on it , Frank . It 's why I brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of this horse Indian country before our men camped in it and chased that fear out of it . And , remember , these Sioux are only the start of it , boy . After them comes the Arikaras , Minnetarees , Blackfeet , Crow , Snake . Take a deep breath of that quiet down there . That 's ' Indian quiet , ' Frank . It gets louder and louder the more you move into it . " I shivered a little and looked up at him . " Thank you , Patron , " I said , " but there is no way for this Rivet to go , save on with you . I can catch that dark scent down there . It stiffens the small bristles on the back of my neck . It pulls the muscles of my stomach together like the fingers of a closed fist . But my father is somewhere up ahead in that stillness . He waits for me or he waits for no one . I ca n't turn back , Captain . "  | Clark returned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well spoke , Frank , " was all he said . " Your father 's a mighty lucky man . " The succeeding day , the twenty-third of September , we made an early camp to insure daylight for all purposes of making ourselves secure against attack . We had come a good distance and were feeling somewhat less strained , but at half after four , with the sun still bathing the prairie and with the surrounding plain seemingly visible for miles in any direction , we had visitors . Captain Lewis and Captain Clark were seated under a shoreside cedar tree examining the idea of permanently combining their notes into one journal . Clark was paying only scant heed to this proposal of company bookkeeping . Suddenly , his eyes narrowed . He pointed over the river to the east . Lewis fell still . York crouched forward as though about to spring . I squinted hard through the westering reflection of sun on water . " Three of them , " announced Clark . " They just slipped out of that point of scrub willow into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , " he exclaimed testily , focusing the instrument , " they 're only children ! " " All little boys , " amplified Clark , needing no glass . " One about eight , two others more like twelve , thirteen . Little one 's cradleboard bare . His friends wear clouts . " Lewis holstered the telescope . I could not tell if he was amused or annoyed . This was a quality of his which no amount of familiarity could penetrate . " Is there anything more you can tell me of them with the naked eye ? " he inquired . Clark grinned . " Sure , " he said . " They 're damned fine swimmers , they 're headed this way , they 're most likely from the nearest camp of our Tetongue Sioux friends . " Lewis seemed to think this over , meanwhile watching the river . Presently he inclined his head . " You 'd better check the guard , Will , " he said . Then  | sharply , to me , " Boy , go fetch me old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rascals . " Clark , who had started off , stopped and came back . " Captain , old Dorion 's gone , " he said . " Left first thing this morning to get those Yankton chiefs started downstream for Washington . " " The devil ! " snapped Lewis . " Now what ? Who can we use to interpret ? Drewyer 's no good to us here . I t takes a horse Indian to talk with these upper river tribes . " IIe bit off an oath , lean head turtled angrily forward . " Damn it all , I suppose young Dorion 's gone , too ! " " Yes , sir , " said Clark calmly . " I guess we 'll have to try with Drewyer . He 's all we 've got . " I stepped forward , saluting awkwardly . Both captains looked at me , surprised . Lewis , of course , scowled instantly . Clark just cocked his head and waited . " Patrons , " I said , " excuse me . But here is a half-breed who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " cried Clark . " You , Frank ? You talk Sioux ? " I shook my head . " No , sir , " I answered , " I do n't talk Sioux , but I do talk the handsign language of this upper country . Uncle Francois taught me much of it . Drewyer says I do better at it than most Indians . I guess it 's something that stays with you , Captain . I was only five years old when Achille Rivet sent me down the river to the Jesuits , but Uncle Francois said I was already at that time more of a hand-talker than the average Pawnee . Anyway , Captain , I can do it ; I can talk for you . " Lewis moved in , examining me as though he had never in this world cast an eye on me before . Finally he nodded , retracting his outthrust head . " All right , Rivet , " he said , " go ahead  --  talk . " Within the next ten minutes Clark and I had met and spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shade of his cedar tree to present each of them with some blue beads and a scarlet hair ribbon . A quarter of an hour after they had waded out of the shallows on our side  | of the Missouri , they were reentering the water , this time the rain-swollen mouth of the creek upon which we were camped . There was no evident deceit on their parts , and very little nervousness . They told us straightforwardly that their own band of eighty lodges was camped on the next creek above . There was another band of sixty lodges of the same people on the next stream above their own . Both bands , they said , were wit l r i r r one easy day by the river . Captain Clark then gave the older two each a carrot of tobacco to bear back to the chiefs of tlrc two bands , with a message to meet and talk with the white captains in their next camp upward on the Mini Sosi , the Big Muddy Waters , as the Indian youths called the Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the boys plunged unexpectedly with it into the flooded prairie tributary . But in a manner miraculous to behold by any expert swimmer such as myself , the rascals held it out of the water in their strong white teeth , heads held far back , and so brought it completely across the 150-foot creekmouth without wetting a leaf of it . And that , briefly enough , was the extent of our " Goat Beach Council " with the redskins . Oh yes , there was one more small matter which our talk with the three Indian boys cleared to the satisfaction of all parties . Captain Clark had been customarily correct in his original guess at the identity of our visitors . They were the Teton Sioux . We set out very early . It was a fair day , only a bit of a soft breeze working from the east . All hands poling with a will , we made many miles by midday . In the afternoon the wind  | switched southeast , still blowing steadily , and we hoisted sail , making better time yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts looking for a landmark expected just below the boundary of " Tetongue Territory " marked for them by Monsieur Loisel . Presently they saw it ; an island long and narrow and near the right shore . On the charts Loisel had crustily named it Good Humored Island , since it was here the Sioux had trapped a camp of his men and stolen their entire cache of trade goods . The island was now deserted , a fact established by the presence upon it of several head of peacefully grazing elk . We ran on by it and came about at its head , where the confluence of a seventy-yard river appeared some one and a half miles above the island proper . Here it was that Clark wrote : ... the french perogue Come up early in the day , the other did not Get up untill the evening Soon after we had come to .. . The discrepancy in time here , from my 2 P.M. to my captain 's " evening Soon after , " was accounted for by an accident of the river in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which Big Bat Deschamps had graciously provided me with that share . When Clark 's journal remarks that the white pirogue did not get up until evening , the simple words cover a multitude of boatman 's woes . But I shall not whimper . Let me only state that Big Bat had never forgiven the wetting I gave his red pirogue in getting past the bar at Platte River . He managed on this present September 24th to catch me and the white pirogue out of sight of Captain Clark and the keelboat . It was below a great half-moon sandbar where the current ran swift as a cannon shot and where , in quartering up across it , our two pirogues rowed furiously within an oar 's length of one another . Deschamps fouled me exactly as I had fouled him at the Platte . My craft broadsided and was saved from foundering only by the shallow bar beneath it . Naturally Big Bat had understood the bar would prevent a total " go under , " but I still had to unload , dry and reload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not far later than  | " evening " when we got up to that night 's camp . Ashore , and still . sin ; irting , I sought out the burly patron of the red pirogue . I Ic s ; iv Inc corning . " Salrristil " he roared . " Look what we have here ; a small wet rooster with his tail feathers draggled and his tiny heart on lire to dry them out ! Ho ! What is it that I can do for you , scrawny Pawnee chicken ? " " Dort bien , mal embouche , " I answered . " It is that you can take notice that I have orders from my captain to take the white pirogue to the Mandan country bow-and-bow with your red one . Do you understand that ? " " Careful who you call ' foul-mouthed : " He grimaced . " However , yes , cockerel , I hear your thin crowing . Was there anything else you wished to cockadoodle from the top of your metis dungheap ? " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mongrel blood . " I am adding a warning of my own to my captain 's order : the white pirogue is not going to get up the river with the red one ; it will be far ahead of it . Do you also comprehend that , big river pig ? " Deschamps ' swarthy face contorted itself . " Mind your tongue , water rat , " he rumbled . " You would not babble so bravely with it slit down the middle like a pet magpie 's . " " From a big cavern blows a big wind , " I said recklessly . " Go to hell and watch out for me on the way . " I thought then that Deschamps would experience a fatal apoplexy . Fatal for me , that was . " Heart of Mary ! " he bellowed . " I would start you on that hot journey in my place , and this instant , too , but you are born under the right planet . Here arrives Capitaine Clark and his black man , as you no doubt planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grin of a full-fed bullfrog all in the moment of the sweeping bow with which he greeted Clark 's approach . " Ah , good evening , Captain . Young Rivet and I were only now saying what a splendid run you made today with the big boat . It was superb . Come , now , Patron , there must be a  | Frenchman hidden in your family 's chart closet . No American could court the Grand Missouri in your manner . " It was a bald-faced lie , of course , and I had not arranged for Clark and my friend York to come up just in that critical moment . However , the circumstances weighed impartially , I did not disown the intrusion . Big Bat had a deserved reputation from St. Louis to Cedar Island for being a true riverhorse , and for me to challenge him as I had was not poor judgment but insanity . It was not without genuine feeling , then , that I joined the French patron in his feigned delight at Clark 's appearance . Indeed , I nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-haired captain ordered Inc to come along with him at the double , since he had some notes in need of final copying , I could easily have embraced him . I did not , of course , because Americans put different interpretations upon such familiarities than did we French . I merely went along as commanded . For the remainder of that night our camp was quiet . The reason was not far to seek and , as usual , it was most eloquently drawn in the blunt language of William Clark 's closing entry for the day . ... Came to about j% Miles above off the Mouth of a Small river about 70 yards wide Called . . . the Little Mississou Missouri River , The Tribes of the Seauex Called the Teton , is Campted about z Miles up on the N.W. Side , and we Shall Call the River after that Nation , Teton . . . we prepare to Speek with the Indians tomorrow at which time we are informed the Indians will be here . . . 2/3rds of our party Camped on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | swivel charged with a langrage of scrap iron , and a soldier standing by with lighted cord . Both pirogues were brought in front their midstream anchorages and hove to , flanking the bar . All was iii readiness by io A.M. By eleven , with no Sioux in sight , a few nerves might be heard tuning up . Lewis and Clark resplendent in their full-dress army officer 's coats , complete with sword and pistol belts , sat beneath the awning discussing with Peter Cruzatte the procedures of the day . Cruzatte , having some Indian blood , had been named over Drewyer as interpreter for the talk . Clark , bless him , had tried to get me the work . Lewis , however , had said quite strongly that it was all well and good to send a boy to do a boy 's work , meaning my talk with the three Sioux youths , but that for men he wanted a man . To confront the adult flower of the " Tetongue " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fully grown , qualified male . The fact that Cruzatte could not read nor reply to handsigns as accurately as myself was not Lewis 's point . He was out to impress the Indians and knew that to ask three main Teton chiefs to talk through a half-white settlement boy was not the way to inaugurate the effort . Clark was compelled to agree . This relegated me to my regular duty post aboard the white pirogue . Under the circumstances I did not resent the banishment : it was now 11:45 A.M. and still no Indians in view . Ashore , things grew tauter still . It was perhaps five minutes later that our inland-posted scouts , Colter and Shields , came racing back to the river . The Teton Sioux were coming . There were three score chiefs and warriors , all fully armed and war-painted . There were no women or children in attendance . Just the men . Just the fighters . These Indians looked to be ready . They were not chatting nor laughing . Just walking quietly with guns and bows and lances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bad Indians . To this message our two captains only nodded and Lewis stood up and stepped away from his camp chair . " Captain , " he said unhurriedly to Clark , " Let us go meet these had people . Perhaps we can persuade them toward the good . "  | So still was the air in that moment that I clearly heard his words offshore in the Pirogue . I saw Clark make an odd little bow , and saw his ready grin flash in the sunlight . But the only sound which came from him was the metallic jingling of his sword chain as he hitched up the weapon and loosened it in its scabbard while following his senior toward the beach at land 's joining of the sandbar . So quiet was the entire waterfront in that final pause that the lapping of the wavelets against the keelboat 's side could be distinctly heard , while the harsh cries of the river birds wheeling over the stream a mile and a half distant pierced the ear as though uttered within a dozen paces . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar of the forest into the sunlight of the shore and came onward , not as if meeting our captains but as if stalking them . It was a sight to chill the flesh . Sun or no sun , I shook like a wet dog to raw wind . " Watch it , Will ! " I heard Captain Lewis say , the warning cutting off sharply , sibilantly . Clark merely nodded , his right hand dropping to the horse pistol at his belt . The oiled gunsteel bite of the cocking piece engaging the trigger sear was the sole audible content of his reply . It was enough . Ten feet away the Sioux halted , stood stock-still , cruel faces expressionless . Lewis , playing to Clark 's lead , let them wait . After what seemed an hour and was more in the order of three bird cries , he raised his hands in the prairie sign of " coming in peace . " Now it was the Sioux permitting the white captains to languish . In their own dark time , the central chief raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His companions , however , made no move . Lewis at this point sent for Cruzatte , who came forward and tried to speak with the central chief . He had no success . But the more desperate-looking of the two flanking chiefs had an obvious knowledge of French , and through this means was able to make Cruzatte understand who he and his fellows were . The central chief , this fellow said , was known as Untongasabaw , Black Buffalo . The other man was Tartongawaka , Medicine Buffalo . His own name was Tortohongar . Having spoken this last name with evident stress , he stood  | waiting as if to see his white confronters fall back in terror . Neither ( lid , however , and Lewis inquired through Cruzatte , " Ask him how his name translates . " When the Sioux was given this question , his bronzed face paled . " ' 1'ortohongar ! " he repeated angrily . " Le Partisan ! " Lewis and Clark exchanged quick glances at this . So did the whole company . But Clark only nodded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him anyway , " and then stood there hard-eyed as any of the Sioux across from him while Cruzatte gave the rough answer back to the Partisan . The famed chief flinched visibly . " What does the Red Head Chief mean ? " he demanded of Cruzatte , partly in bastard French , partly by signs . The uneasy interpreter did his best to convey the temper of Clark 's language but the task was beyond his command of the sign talk and the Partisan 's comprehension of finer French . It was plain to me , watching from the white pirogue , that the infamous Teton had caught some of the challenge in Clark 's statement and was returning it . Clark understood this , too . He took a long , deliberate stride toward the three chiefs , halting before Black Buffalo . Cruzatte , after a gulping look around at Lewis , followed him unhappily . " Tell Black Buffalo , " ordered Clark , " that Loisel has spoken well of him down the river . Say that we understand from Loisel , who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also say that we have been told by Loisel that the Partisan is a very bad man . Tell him we want to talk soft but that if this Partisan wants to talk hard with me , I am ready to let him try it . " Cruzatte gulped again , nodded helplessly , passed the redheaded captain 's ultimatum along . Black Buffalo turned to Medicine Buffalo and spoke rapidly in Sioux . Both then spoke to the Partisan who first scowled murderously , then grinned vacuously . " Bcaucoup , beaucoup , " he said , waving at Clark as if the entire thing had been good Sioux fun . Then , in handsigns to Cruzatte , " Come on , Frenchman , let 's go to the soldier lodge and talk soft . "  | Not waiting for agreement , he pushed past Clark and Lewis , leading the way toward the awning . As if this were a signal , his move brought forth from the black shade of the forest a torrent of hidden Sioux women and children . These were accompanied by the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , and one piebald old mare suckling a new foal . The entire cavalcade swarmed toward the sandbar , the scene going from incipient tragedy to gala holiday in less than a minute . " From murder to mardi Bras , " was the glib way George Shannon described it , but I was not so pleased as he and some of the others of my comrades . The entire approach of the savages was suspect in my view . Perhaps it was the blood of my Pawnee mother warning me against these first of the true horse Indians . Again , it may have been because the Tetons were the tribe which had sold my father into slavery with the Shoshone . Or possibly the warnings of Regis Loisel about the ugly devil Tortoliongar were playing in excess upon my French nerves . Whatever the reason , I warped the white pirogue nearer the bank of the sandbar . I had no concrete idea of what I intended doing in case of trouble , but by this time it was instinctive for me to stay close to Captain Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs now commanded their people to stay on the main riverbank , it not being considered fit that squaws and children sit in council . Half the warriors stayed with the tribe , the remaining half followed the three principal chiefs and our captains to the fly tent out on the fingerlike bar . Here Lewis resumed his camp chair , the undeniable hallmark of white mastery , while Clark sat cross-legged on the ground facing the chiefs . The latter were seated on white buffalo robes , their men ranged in tribal rank behind them . The council now commenced . Cruzatte moved up to stand midway of the two groups and attempted the beginning speech . At once I knew that he was in difficulty . He could not make the Sioux come around to French , which tongue they certainly understood , nor could he piece out the disparity with his limited command of the handsign language .  | Instantly Captain Clark was on his feet . His scanning glance tell upon the white pirogue and me . " Aliuy , Frank ! " he called . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tetongues . " Vastly frightened , I did as he bid . When I had splashed thruuuh the shallows of the bar and stood with him confrontirng the tall Sioux chiefs , the latter were already coming to their feet . Behind them their warriors were starting to move . It was an ominous moment . They could not have comprehended Clark 's English order to me but they were clearly alarmed all the same . Lewis , ever steady , remained in his chair . York drifted up and came to a looming stand at Clark 's elbow . " Try to tell them , " the latter now instructed me calmly , " that the big soldier chief wants to make a speech . " He meant Lewis , and I conveyed this fact by handsigns to Black Buffalo . He signaled that he understood and that his side would wait and listen to the son of their great new father . Lewis then rose and presented the peace talk from President Jefferson designed to be given to every important tribe on the way up the river . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessly behind him and the chiefs were making unpleasant signs to their warriors , the latter scowling and muttering and shaking their heads menacingly . Clark moved to Lewis 's side . " Better let me hand out the medals right off , Captain , " he suggested . " They 're getting set to go ugly on us . " " All right , " answered Lewis , " go ahead . I believe you are right and that they mean to make trouble . " " Captain , " said Clark , his eyes never leaving the muttering Sioux , " it 's my opinion they mean a mite more than trouble . I 'd say they aimed to settle us here and now . Look yonder on the hank while I talk with this bunch . Do n't let them see you 're any bit worried , now . " He began to talk with the three chiefs , gesturing importantly to draw their attention . While they watched him , Lewis stole his look shoreward . Cruzatte and I , with the others beneath the awning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the women and children  | of the original band stood a silently added audience of at least Roo newcomers . These late arrivals were all adult warriors and were painted enough differently from our prior guests to let us know who they were  --  the Sioux from the second village of sixty lodges upstream . I could feel my scalp pull tight . We were now faced with the total strength of the Teton Sioux , where we had carefully planned to council with them one band at a time on separate  --  and well-separated  --  days . I am morally convinced that I was not the only one to feel the sudden eerie cold of that bright awning 's shade . Sunleathered Peter Cruzatte was pale as a settlement storekeeper . Even ebony York seemed lighter by several hues . Clark and Lewis alone stood outwardly unchanged . It was a proud moment , if fearful , for our captains . During it Clark said quietly , " The medals , Captain , " and Lewis merely took the bright trinkets from the box by his chair and answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've much else to do this afternoon . " I steered the white pirogue prayerfully into the main stream . Behind , on the sandbar , the council stood suspended in uneasy truce while my trim craft probed out toward the waiting keelboat . Aboard we carried strange cargo  --  Captain William Clark and five Teton Sioux . The latter were Black Buffalo , Medicine Buffalo , the Partisan and two noted fighting men , Second Bear and Considerable Man , all names contained on that list of good and bad men furnished us in La Charrette by Regis Loisel , and the last three marked very bad indeed . Our objective was as uncertain as our cargo , worse luck .  | When the council had continued to go sour after the crisis of the nodal-giving , the beribboned Jefferson baubles having failed utterly to impress the Tetons , Clark had conceived this sudden inspiration to take the headmen , the two good and the three very bad , out to the big barge on a formal tour of inspection . The idea was to intimidate the chiefs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man 's bluff of course , but as Clark had said to me in embarking just now , " Ilold steady , lad . You never win without putting down your money . " I brought the pirogue alongside the keelboat now , and Clark and the Sioux scrambled over her low gunwale . The captain quickly showed his guests the swivel cannon , bow and stern ; ordered the stern gun fired into the far bank to impress them with the weapon 's " terrible long medicine , " and then demonstrated how the lids of the deck cargo lockers could be cleverly raised to form a " war shield , " from behind which a very few well-armed , resolute white riflemen might annihilate any number of reckless , ill-advised red savages . The Sioux said nothing . If they were in any degree intimidated , it would not have been wise for any sane white man to gamble on the guess . They simply revealed no emotion whatever , either of appreciation or belligerence . However , when Captain Clark , never at a loss with redmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwent an instant , beatific change . One would have thought they had smelled water after twenty days in the desert . The sight of that whiskey literally illuminated the ugly faces of those red devils . In especial was this true of the celestial halo bathing the grinning vulture 's beak and lupine fangs of the Partisan . He ought to have been canonized on the spot  --  I mean by the swivel gun . The Sioux went from insolent boorishness to shameless fawning at the pop of the cork . Captain Clark cautiously issued them but a quarter-cup each , seeking unobtrusively to retire the bottle at that mark . The Partisan , however , was ahead of him . Downing his dram , he threw the tin cup overboard and seized the bottle from Clark in such a rude way as nearly to upset the stout captain . I saw Clark 's eyes take fire . He turned  | scarlet to the roots of his red mane , but he held himself in soldierly check . " Tell that Indian , " he ordered me , tight-lipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break his right arm out of its shoulder socket . Tell him also , Frank , that I shall do it in front of all his people , so that the break will include his man pride . " I hesitated . This was a dire threat . A grand chief humbled before his people was thenceforth a ruined man . This much I knew absolutely from the teachings of my Uncle Francois . " Patron , " I said , " we must take care . Let me speak to him in another , less devastating way . " Clark 's blood was up . He shook his head vehemently . " Say it as you were told , Rivet , " he said . " Exactly . " Turning unhappily , I obeyed . The Indians listened a moment , dark faces hardening . Then , the Partisan tipped up the bottle and gurgled at it noisily . The warrior Considerable Man made a grab for it and succeeded in getting it away . He put it smackingly to his own lips and the other warrior , Second Bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ensued a violent , brief tussle before the bottle was gulped empty of its contents , then the three rascals fell to taking turns sucking and licking at the neck of the dry container like brute , dumb animals . When , finally , the Partisan gave a coarse laugh and threw the bottle from him into the river , he had consumed perhaps  --  as his lion 's share  --  the better part of a pint of raw whiskey in something less than five minutes . In his pagan belly the fire was burning . With a dog 's filth curse in mongrel French , he lurched deliberately into Captain Clark . I thought then that the finish was upon us . But I had forgotten my patron 's dark guardian angel . York came over the side of the keelboat like a huge and shining black seal . He had followed the white pirogue out from shore , swimming to stay with his master . Hiding under the overhang of the big boat 's hull , he had no doubt planned to swim back , undiscovered , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pirogue . But now he seized the Partisan as a serpent would seize a rat and would most certainly have killed the Sioux had not  | Captain Clark roared for him to desist . The giant Negro slowly lowered the Teton chief to the deck  --  he had raised him completely overhead to dash out his brains athwart the forecastle ? and his master was able , through my swift assistance with sign language and forced smiles , to convince the five Sioux that York 's performance had been a part of their planned entertainment aboard ship . The curiosity of the Indians in seeing the black man at close hand served to tide us over this chanceful moment . York was surely the first Negro of any description to be seen on the Upper Missouri , and the savages were unquestionably in awe of his enormous size and wild looks . Under cover of this respect , combined with the face-saving of Captain Clark 's desperately invented lie , we were able to herd them back into the pirogue and return without further incident to the sandbar council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of our circumstance , quickly presented to Black Buffalo a laced red uniform coat of the kind worn by officers in the United States Corps of Artillerists , together with a cocked hat and a red , white and blue turkey feather . To Medicine Buffalo and the two noted warriors he gave peace papers . The Partisan got nothing , as was his surly , half-drunken due . During this second ceremony the Indians ashore came forward in a mass , and we stood on the bar virtually surrounded by Sioux . When the captains then announced that the meeting was done for the day and would be resumed upriver tomorrow , not an Indian moved . We knew then , instantly , that the entire thing had been planned by them in this way . They meant only to get all that we were going to give them , then bluff us out of more  --  indeed , out of all . Clark took charge here without discussion . He told Lewis to engage Black Buffalo in the most fervent English harangue he might manage . Meanwhile he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keelboat , load her with riflemen and return . But the damnable Partisan was at the pirogue before we could board her . Laughing wickedly , he wrapped both arms about her mast , while two of his Sioux comrades blocked our way on the bar , and three more stood in the shallows , their hands laid  | to the mooring cable . At once Clark called , " Captain Lewis , come over here , sir ! " Then , as Lewis moved to obey , he turned to me . " Talk to Black Buffalo , " he ordered . " Tell him to call these devils away from our boat . If he will not make them leave it , I shall . " I had never seen him this disturbed in a thousand miles of the Missouri . At last his red hair and Scotch-Irish ancestry had the better of him . I knew that unless Black Buffalo might persuade the Partisan and his scowling warriors to abandon the pirogue forthwith , there was going to be a violence on that beach which could see us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people . There was , instead , a frightening growl from the entire tribe and they drew in upon us so tightly at the pirogue 's mooring that we were cut off from Captain Lewis , who was entombed now somewhere in the body of the mob-beast with York , who had been commanded by Clark to stay with the other captain " until death . " But Clark , as ever , struck boldly . Ignoring the Sioux holding the cable , he went straightaway into the pirogue , confronting the Partisan . The astonished warriors , staring after him , permitted me to scuttle past them and into the boat behind Clark . The latter , seeing me , merely nodded . " All right , Frank , " he said , " you tell this throat-slitting pig precisely what I say : If he does not get his damned filth paws off that mast , I shall cut them off of it , and off of him . " With the cold anger of the words , he slid his dress sword from its scabbard and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Partisan 's beaded headband . The arc of the blade flashed in the sun . In the silence of the following hush , the Partisan 's war feather , together with his proudly roached topknot hair which carried it , fluttered through the air and down upon the planking of the pirogue 's bottom . I thought , then , that the Partisan 's vicious eyes would bug entirely from their places in his skull . " Tell him , " said Captain Clark evenly , " that this is only to show him that I mean what I say . " I rushed into a torrent of French and handsign pleadings with the dumbstruck Teton chief . I knew what that eagle  | feather and coached scalplock meant among his people , and I knew that the manner in which Clark had smote both sacred items Irunn him had been a mortal insult . No possible question existed of Clark 's understanding this too . Yet neither man moved during my hoarse entreaty . I shall never know if the Partisan heard my pleas , or if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just slowly , slowly let his hands slide away from the mast of the white pirogue , his pit viper 's stare never leaving Captain Clark 's hardset face . Behind me on the sandbar I heard a mass indrawing of many breaths . I turned my glance to see that the Sioux by the dozens and scores were silently fitting arrows to bowstrings . In the same ominous pause I saw brave Shannon , with Drewyer , Colter , the two Fields brothers and half a dozen more of our most trusted men shoulder their arms . Then , in the same stillness which heard the loud nocking of arrows , the wonderful , chilling steel clink-clank of cocking rifle hammers was added . In this breath-held vacuum of pending tragedy the Partisan struck . He came at Captain Clark with a skinning knife , a ten-inch blade keen as surgeon 's steel . Clark , disdaining any advantage , threw aside his sword , accepting combat with bare hands . In the first rush the Sioux missed his strike , the knife narrowly slashing past Clark 's ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seizing the redman 's wrist , he drove the bony cap of his shoulder into the pit of the Partisan 's arm-hollow , lifted him free of the deck , and threw him over his own bowed back down upon the planks with a boat-jarring crash . Before the Indian might recover , Clark leaped upon him , pulled him to his feet and doubled the knife arm up behind the savage 's shoulder blade . They stood , thus , in full view of the Indian mob ashore . The drama held the watching Sioux from swarming over Captain Lewis and the white rifle squad . In such a quick and sudden stillness , the sound of the Partisan 's arm being dislocated from its shoulder socket by the brutal force now twistingly applied to it by Captain Clark was heard as plainly as the snapping of a branch in a silent forest . The chief made a sound in his chest like the wounded ani- mal he was . The sound was picked up and echoed by his fellows on the sandbar . It was a wordless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tongueless nature . Captain Clark stepped away from the crippled Partisan . He picked up the Sioux chief 's knife and threw it overboard . It splashed and sank in the clear shallows . The white captain turned and left the pirogue . Our riflemen ashore parted and let him through . The Indian pack also spread away , making an aisle . Lewis , still shepherded by York , came out of the press and stood with Clark . The only sound which came after that was the raspingly muted twang of bowstrings being unbent , and the soft rattling thumps of arrows being dropped back into quivers of elk and buffalo hockskin . All faces , dark red and pale white , turned again to the pirogue . The Partisan came away from the boat , head high . His useless arm , unquestionably in an agony of raw pain , hung and flopped at his side in the manner of a scarecrow 's . IIe did not look either at his countrymen or at his enemies , but stared only straight ahead , face gray with shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those of his own motionless tribesmen . Only when he had crossed the long stretch of the river 's bank and disappeared into the shroud of thick cedar timber , from whence but an hour gone he had emerged haughty and cold and cruel , did his fellow Sioux turn to follow him . And then they did it in the somber grieving fashion of a cortege departing the scene of some great dishonorable funeral . Captain Clark kept his word . He had wrenched the arm of the Partisan from its socket and , with it , had broken the pride and the power and spirit of the Partisan . He had humbled and reduced in the full view of his tribal kinsmen the most feared of the upper river Sioux pirate chieftains . And he had done it in less than six full breaths and without a weapon . It was no wonder that as they followed their menfolk from that fated sandbar the Teton women covered their heads with their blankets . The power of their people on the Missouri was finished . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very early , in a consummate show of pure courage , Captain Clark , accompanied only by York , with my- self as interpreter , went to the main Sioux camp , unarmed and un:uu , onn vd , and with his great skill in such things replaced tlu ' I ' : urtisan 's subluxated arm into its socket . The Teton 's relief from the enormous suffering of the disloiation was of course quick and complete . His seeming gratefulness was of the same quality but Clark , his rash act of mercy ollee done , viewed this sudden turn of Sioux heart with gravest reservations . We retreated immediately from the village and tinder cover of that same midnight stealthily resumed our march upriver . But the Sioux were not so easily done with us , as we with them , and in our very first camp above , they showed up in force and fawning humility , bearing with them 400 pounds of buffalo meat as a peace offering to our " mighty captains . " The meat was go per cent bad due to the unseasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puckish sense of justice never deserting him , insisted we accept it and in return ordered an issue made to the Sioux of three barrels of overwhelmingly spoiled corned pork . Since we had for the past week been seeking some place in the river where we might dump this ptomainic cargo without killing too many innocent fish , or downriver friendly Indians , the trade seemed right and fair to us all . However , Clark 's generosity failed its purpose , since not one Teton showed any least ill effect from this greenish sow meat and , indeed , they all plagued us incessantly for more of it . These unwanted " peace meetings " continued day by day up the river , the Tetons refusing to abandon us . Our little company was for no minute deceived by this faithful attendance on shore . These were still deadly grinning red wolves trailing fleeing white sheep and waiting only the moment of weakness or unwariness which would provide them the proper circumstance for the kill . The strain for us grew intolerable . Captain Clark did not sleep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of September 3oth we at last dropped our Indian river pilot  --  a Teton chief and brother of Black Buffalo , whom the latter had secretly supplied us to see us safely guided to the next nation above  --  the red-haired officer was on the brink of physical collapse .  | His hand shook so badly he could not hold the quill and I essayed to take it from him and to write the closing entry of that memorable day for him . However , pale and sick as he was for want of rest , he rallied to take the pen back and to chide me with his infallibly bright grin for my " pusillanimous lack of faith in his staying powers . " Then , with me steadying the journal and holding it to the light for him , he scrawled out the words which saw us finally free of the " murdering Tetongues . " ... We proceeded on under a verry Stiff Breeze from the S.E. the Stern of the boat got fast on a log and the boat turned &; was verry near filling up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Chief on board was so fritened at the Motion of the boat which in its rocking Caused Several loose articles to fall on the Deck from the lockers , he ran and hid himself , and we landed , he got his gun and informed us that he wished to return , that all things were now cleare for us to go on , we would not see any more Tetons &c.; we repeated to him what had been Said before , and advised him to keep his men away , gave him a blanket a Knife &; some Tocacco , Smokd. a pipe &; he Set out . We also Set Sale and Came to at a Sand Bar , &; Camped , a verry Cold evening , all on guard . . . The days turned brittle cold now . Crying strings of wild brant and the great gray geese of Canada fled southward overhead . The gold and crimson , violet , umber and ochre of fall departed  | the hills . Brown and sear the prairies waited for the " white grass of winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ice in its bared teeth . By dawn the hoar frost silvered the lowlands of the river , making a lacery of the naked willows , limning the frozen feet of the low , close-crowding hills . It was an urgent , a warning time , and we responded to it . But the river fought us each foot of the way . Her shallowing channels diverged into blind lagoons , her constantly silting current blocked ways by daylight which with previous dark had been open and clear . The winds , following us for so many weeks past , now came about into our faces . More and more the pole replaced the sail , the towrope , the oar . The barge would go aground a dozen times in any day 's journey , the pirogues twice that in piloting the way . No man could bear more than thirty minutes in such freezing water and the wonder was that any of us survived those final fourteen days . Even so  --  and indeed because the very loneliness and cold of those northern latitudes combined so bone chillingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled to the blaze of each camp 's fire  --  we had the chance and inclination to bring forward our various private journals of those last miles below the Mandans . Here is a specimen from my own : Mond . Oct. 15 , 1804 Camp news these past ten days is spare . One promotion , one demotion . Good fellow R. Frazer of Warfington 's squad has been enlisted with the permanent company to replace Gass , who has been made Sgt. , this on Oct. 8th . Yesterday , the 14th , J. Newman of the permanent party was court-martialed for insubordination , only the 2nd case in all these months and miles . Newman was sentenced to 75 lashes , which he got at once . He was likewise denied all status and ordered returned to St. Louis and discharged with dishonor from the U.S. Army . Frazer 's joy at being chosen to go on beyond the Mandan was touching . Because of some pride it may one day give his kin , I am going to copy the notice of his appt. from the Orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and haveing become one of the Corps of Vollenteers for Northwestern Discovery , he is therefore to be viewed and respected accordingly ; and will be annexed to Sgt. Gass 's mess . Wm . Clark Cpt . &c.; Meriwether Lewis Capt . 1st U.S. Regt . Infty . " From the peculiar spelling , as well as the order in which the names of the officers appear , it is left to the imagination which of our captains made the foregoing entry in the company orderly book . Musing here over the guttering flames tonight I continued in my diary , it is difficult to forget the Arikaras , in whose land we now are . They are strange Indians . They even refuse our whiskey and told Lewis that they were " surprised their white father would seek to make a present to them of a liquid which would make them fools . " Aside from the ardent natures of their women , they are the most upright of savages . I think also , here in this cold and lonely camp , of the Teton Sioux . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body cocooned in a fine Arikara buffalo robe , I shiver again at the memory . We have picked up a Frenchman named Pierre Tabeau , said to be the agent of Regis Loisel for the Mandan and Sioux . As he speaks both of these tongues , I am momentarily relieved as interpreter . Plitt a Dieu that M. Tabeau stays the winter . It is something to discuss Indian fine points with nothing but two hands and a bit of French to fill in the blank pauses . The wind blows so fiercely tonight that the water from the river is driven like fine rain into our entire campsite . The dampness adds greatly to the misery of the mercury , which stands at minus 7 ? of the freezing mark . We are camped on starb. shore below ten lodges of Arikaras , or " Rees . " Chattering here upon the icy ground ,  | I imagine those snug lodges of earth and log , with their friendly , bright-eyed dwellers , waiting so near and yet so damnably far from this chill fire and Frank Rivet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , a not entire disappointment to me . As we rested , a Frenchman named ) os pli ( : ravelines walked into our camp . He proved , as Tabeau before him , an employee of Loisel . Captain Lewis was delighted to hire Gravelines as an interpreter and from him we learned considerable of the Mandans , whose mysterious land we now approached . After eating we set out again , all hands heartened by the talk with Gravelines . The wind , too , cooperated . Out came the sails and away we went up the Missouri . The French boatmen chanted St. Louis ditties . The American soldiers responded with lusty ballads . Everyone lolled about the decks repairing gear , napping , or swapping lies in support of their manhood either as lovers , thieves or fighters . Given another hour of the fair wind and no fouling , and even Captain Lewis was seen to smile and say something pleasant . At 2 P.M. we encountered a memorable blockade on the river  --  an antelope " harvest . " By a system of set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous numbers of the " goats " into a milling herd which they now , with wild shouts and waving blankets , were forcing to take the water at a shallow crossing . In the waist-deep channel the Indians were able to move about easily , but the antelopes were made to swim and were therefore rendered helpless . As we drew up , the naked warriors were wading unhurriedly among the poor brutes , skulling them with clubs or even mere large rocks . I counted fifty-eight dead antelope bobbing in the bloody shallows in the moments we pushed on through the carnage under full sail , and the Sioux cheerfully called to us that the hunt had been on " only a few pipe puffs. , " It left me badly shaken to see these gentle things dead and ( lying and waiting to die , yet I heard Captain Lewis remark enthusiastically that it was but one of those rhythms of raw  | nature which , if viewed objectively , must come to have a certain powerful beauty of its own . Well , perhaps . For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood and the floating bits of bone and hair , together with the mildly sad and puzzled bleatings of the babies looking for their mothers who could not answer them . The following day , the seventeenth of October , was a bad one , the wind hard against us from outset . We made but six miles by dark . Mr. Gravelines said that we were presently opposite the storied Black Mountain Range , the " Court Nou , " as Captain Clark recorded it in his bravely original French . The Sioux name is He Sapa , the Black Hills . Captain Clark came to my bedding spot as I was nodding off that night and admonished me to cheer up , since he had a surprise for me tomorrow . I thanked him but slept badly , no least bit cheered by the prospect . However , the weather warming and fine with dawn , and the wind come again happily astern , we hoisted canvas to glide away upriver , all spirits soaring . Directly following the start , at Mile Three of the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast stream entering from the west . Captain Clark waved over from the keelboat , pointing it out to me and bellowing , " Luh Bullet ! Luh Bullet ! " Never dreaming this was his promised surprise , I waved back and fell to examining " The Bullet " indifferently . Suddenly my eyes narrowed . The banks and cliffs of the racing tributary were literally paved with strangely embedded , perfectly round stones resembling nothing so much as a rocky kind of artillery shot  --  limestone cannonballs , if you will  --  and it was when this comparison dawned for me that I understood Clark 's atrocious French . His " Luh Bullet " was my " Le Boulet , " the sinister and historic Cannonball River ! Here , of all places we might reach , was where my own personal adventure up the Grand Missouri began . This was the precise spot where the boat of my father Achille had upset and the merciless current swept him away into cruel Shoshone bondage . Here then would I reswear my vengeance against his  | red keepers . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a splendid oath , little doubt , and salty , if only for the tears of righteous outrage which it brought to my brave eyes . But the damned Missouri obtruded on my high resolve and struck it low . From the Cannonball onward , the wind dropped dead , the water fell shallow , the men sullen . The salt of noble weeping was replaced by the inglorious stinging of blistered hands . Aie Dieu , what toil ! And what ingratitude from the Fates . With this date , Saturday , October 2o , 1804 , we were forty miles north of the Cannonball River . With us now was a Ree chief claiming to have had a vision to go with us and " talk great new father peace " with the Mandans . The captains suffered him to stay . Also today Peter Cruzatte shot the first " grizzled " bear . These animals are well known to us by hearsay as the most extremely fierce of all bears . This one was a monster . He left behind a track of his paw into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cruzatte was a fool and lucky to be alive . When wounded , these great bears nearly always charge . This one fled , crying like a dog . During the night it rained , the drops freezing in solid , beadlike globules on the ground . Sunday 's resulting cold was intense . It bit the tubes of the upper lungs . It stuck together the spittle of the lips . The wind , high again at dawn , suddenly fell off at our start , and it began to snow . It was our first fall , and a grim reminder how late we were in our race against the great freeze-over . Clark pushed us wickedly , Sabbath or no . Yet we made but seven miles . Camp was early , enforced by physical exhaustion . At Mile Four of the day 's log we had seen the moldering traces of a second deserted Mandan town . The previous day , at late twilight , we had seen the first of these shadowy " ghost villages " of the past . There were three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mandan Nation . " Dead lodges , " he called them , and accurately enough , we all thought , considering the ethereal silence which enshrouded their gaping doors and weed-grown sills . The third town , he said , waited on  | the north bank only two miles above where we presently sat huddled to the fitful warmth of Clark 's mess fire , in that snowbound camp . " Very soon now , " he told the captain , deep-voiced and leaning intently forward , " the Mandan People come . " The events of the next four days magnified our tensions of anticipation . Now we knew that we were extremely near to our first great goal . It became suddenly a time for taking final stock , making final reassessments , for marshaling all men and materiel of the expedition for the critical entrance into the Land of the Mandan . Men react to such strictures in unexpected ways , and very strange things happened in that tensing camp of the night of October z4th . Things such as Big Bat Deschamps coming tip to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " here now , little rooster , little water rat , let us shake hands and say no more of any pirogue races to the Mandan villages . " And such things as Captain Lewis calling me over to his mess and telling me , before his men , " Well , boy , you 've done right well . I was wrong about you . You 're a Rivet . " And things , lastly , such as Captain Clark , under pretense of taking me to check over the white pirogue 's anchoring , telling me that Gravelines had informed him and Captain Lewis that but for me the company never would have gotten past the Teton Sioux . " Seems the devils spotted you , Frank , " he said . " You must resemble old Achille to the eyelash . There 's no other way to account for it , Gravelines says . They told him and Tabeau , both , that they let us go through because we had the son of the drowned man ' with us . They must figure they owe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Anyways , Frank , we 're even . I likely saved your bacon for you back at La Charrette , and you sure as sin kept mine from getting overfried back at that Sioux sandbar . One minus one , boy , it ciphers out zero . " " No , Patron , " I said , head bowed . " You are much too generous . I am certain of your guardianship of me , whereas you only guess at what small good I have been to you . " " Pshaw ! " He grinned . " Forget it . We 're square . "  | We talked a little more , quietly ; then he said good night and wheeled about to depart . " ( , al , itaine ! " I called after him . " A moment , please . Do you think my father is alive ? " lie turned back to me , frowning . " I do n't know , " he answered . " I 've asked Gravelines about it and he claims the I etcnigues wo n't say right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Gravelines says in Sioux that comes out dead yet alive . ' So how would we translate it ? " " It 's impossible , " I said . " But do you then have any idea , Patron , why the Sioux should have such a strong feeling for my father that it protects his son thirteen years after ? And protects even the friends of that son ? " " I said I did n't understand it , Frank . " " If you will not say he is alive , then , Patron , will you say that my father is dead ? " Clark set his blunt , red-bristled jaw . " Frank , " he said carefully , " let 's leave it this way : a legend does n't feed for thirteen years on nothing but Indian wind . Something solid is keeping that story about your father being a captive of the Snakes going the rounds of the lodgefires up in this country . " " But you do n't think it 's a good something , do you , Patron ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaching his decision , he nodded resolutely . " No , sir , Frank , " he said , " I do n't . " I dropped my head again . He went away quickly , with his long driving strides , up the beach toward the beckoning cheery glow of the campfires . I was left there in the white pirogue with my Pawnee fears and settlement-bred lonelinesses , forty-eight hours and twenty-two miles below the villages of the Mandan . The morning of the twenty-fifth was crackling cold . The wind was like an assassin 's knife , it made little noise but went in deep . Being from the southeast , however , it permitted us to hoist the big sheet on the barge as well as the two small  | puffers on the pirogues , and so we were able to set sail up the Grand Missouri in a final style becoming to The Corps of Volunteers for Northwestern Discovery . From Mile Three of this day , the banks of the river became dotted with smaller , more recently abandoned towns both of Arikara and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Lewis told us , that the Rees lived with the Mandans when the former had been driven north by the persecutions of the Teton Sioux . Sorne of these town sites were fixed by the senior captain to be no more than five years empty . Now suddenly , in the darkening afternoon , the bank eastward of the river began to bloom with small parties of Indians of a tribe we had not seen . As we puzzled over them , our Ree chief began to show great agitation and to dance about on the deck and cry out in his bastard French , " Mendann ( s ! Mendannes ! " while pointing at the strangers , and we knew who those Indians were . Ashore , the Mandans gathered in ever greater numbers , following our boats upstream with repeated pleas for us to halt and take them aboard the " wondrous camp which fled on the water under the big white flag . " This reference to the keelboat could not , of course , be accommodated , and the host on shore did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swarm , both afoot and on horseback now . We began to wonder belatedly about the true quality of their reported " general friendliness . " Clark studied them through Lewis 's glass for quite a while , with day 's last light , and finally shook his head . " All I know is that they 're Indians , Captain , " he said . " We 'd best hold to the left bank and pick a good high campsite . " Lewis did not debate the suggestion . He hove to at once on the near shore , directly opposite to the main horde of shouting , gesturing Mandans . The night passed crawlingly . The following morning , October 26 , 1804 , we solemnly stood to the colors while Captain Lewis read aloud to us a brief commendation , but most moving , of our steadfast services  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | much easier to talk with than any Indians we had met , and one felt immediately that these were civilized Indians and , indeed , civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this amicability , our captains were able , almost at once , to devote themselves to the pressing matter of constructing our winter quarters . Clark , of course , with his positive genius for workaday engineering , was given the assignment of locating and putting up the military compound . He moved in his accustomed manner ? quickly . On November 2nd , less than one week from our arrival , he chose a site three miles down the Missouri from the first village , and upon the north bank . Work of clearing the land began that same day , and the very next day he had the French boatmen begin construction of the pirogue with which they would shepherd the big barge back down the Missouri . It was upon this second day , also , that he hired a man who was to loom large in our fates . This was Toussaint Charbonneau . He was taken into the company as an interpreter for the Minnetaree Indians . These were the Gros Ventres , or socalled " Big Bellies . " Since they had a reputation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely difficult for white tongues to master , the addition of Charbonneau was considered an important achievement . For myself , I did not care for Toussaint Charbonneau , and I did not trust him . When I made bold to say something of this to Captain Clark , he laughed and said , " Look out , boy , you 're behaving like a Pawnee , " and urged me thereafter to attend to my work and leave the worrying to him and Captain Lewis . I accepted the order , but not in my heart . In the first days that the log fortress was going up , Lewis held talks with the Mandan . He made friends with Black Cat , the grand chief , and was able to arrange for supplies of shelled corn , Indian meal , moccasins and other items of which our men were in some need , or at least desire . With Black Cat he arranged , as well , a formal peace with the ambassador Arikara chief from downriver , guaranteeing a state of friendly relations with the Ree and Mandan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States and the great father in  | Washington . He gave out a vast quantity of Jefferson medals and peace papers and considered his time most well employed . I am certain that Clark did not agree , but the red-haired captain made his usual comment when it came to being critical of his co-commander . He said nothing at all . There were five principal villages built about the mouth of Knife River . Some were on the south , some on the north bank . Two of these main towns were pure Mandan , the other three were bastard Mandan-Minnetaree and Mandan-Anahaway Indians . Insofar as they may need to be entered here , the main chiefs of these combined peoples were Black Cat , Big White , Little Fox , Big Thief , Black Moccasin , White Buffalo , Red Shield and that ominous Minnetaree figure whom we had not yet seen or heard word from , Le Borgne , the OneEyed . But we had no leisure to build fears while building our fortress . Clark saw to that . We were permitted time off only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing our clothes and , upon rare occasions , for company hails and farewells . These latter times were such events as the departure of Joseph Gravelines with the Arikara ambassador back downriver to pick up the Ree chiefs for the visit to President Jefferson , and the arrival in our camp on November loth of a Pawnee chief who asked for the son of Achille Rivet and of the Pawnee woman , Antelope . One may well envision the excitement which sprang up within me when , upon being asked by Clark what it was that he wished of me , the Indian replied that he was Chief Lame Horse , the father of Antelope and the Grandfather of her half-white son . Since I spoke the handsign language fluently by this time , Clark granted me the unusual privilege of meeting with Lame Horse in private . We were given the entire remainder of the day in which to discuss my mother and whatever else I might gain from my red grandfather of information on the Indians beyond the villages of the Mandan . I had no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that I would in consequence be able to render my  | captains a considerable service of enlightenment upon the trails which waited them when winter passed . 1H:1de my first mistake immediately , of course . " Vcll , Grandfather , " I signed to him , airily and with visible vanity in my mastery of the hand movements , " what do you think of your half-white grandson that you have come so far to see ? " The old man , it developed , did not favor the handsigns. 1 fe had some command of English , and even a little French . Ile did not mean to be talked to as though he were some ignorant savage come to trade ermine or otter for glass beads or grains of sugar . " Boy shut mouth , " he said , voice cracked as a bullfrog 's . " Talk when told . " " What 's that ? " I asked , startled into a return to the English . " You do n't want to talk to me ? " " Me talk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed clear enough , and so I fell still and let him look at me . At the same time , I had a glance at him . He was short and had a big head . His body composed , it seemed , twothirds of his entire height , his legs being very short and so bowed as to defy description . Terms such as bulldog and bantam rooster spring to mind , but they pale in use . My grandfather was so bow-legged and so pigeon-toed that in the literal sense he could scarcely walk . His progress when walking was a hybrid of lame goose and drunken sailor . He waddled and rolled and pitched all in the same incredible motion , as he began to pace to and fro before the mess fire while studying me from beneath his hawk-nosed scowl . One could not say of his features that they were ugly . His face held too much of the sun and wind of many years . There was a gleam of dark pride in the old eyes which would not be denied . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have had eighty winters , or more , upon him . No , Grandfather Lame Horse was not common or ordinary . What , by contrast , his fierce examination was showing him of his half-French grandson was presently revealed .  | " Goddam , " he said very plainly , and shaking his head in disapproval , " too skinny , too small in face , bad mouth . Not look like mother . Good nose . Big like father . Strong chin , eyes no good . Gray eyes bad . Mean and sneaky nature , always . White man 's eyes . Skin too weak . Not dark . Thin skin , wound easy . Teeth all right . Jaw no good . Too narrow . No chew buffalo hock leather . No make bowstring , no make moccasin string , no make gutstring for repair saddle , bridle , rifle scabbard . No good chew anything . Grandson not much . Trip to see him long like hell . Goddam . Me go now . " It could be said that Lame Horse had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept to himself . He had come many miles across a cold country in the belly of a hard winter to see this son of his only and dead daughter Antelope , and he had found not the Indian scion he had envisioned in his Pawnee pride , but a damned ribby and wretched half-breed boy looking much more French than Indian . Stunned as I was by his sudden announcement , and his attendant gesture of rising to his full height and calling over his shoulder for his two companions to bring him his pony , I yet managed to find tongue to plead with him to stay , to desist , that we had not yet spoken of my mother , that would talk at length of her , that I had missed her all these years as only a Pawnee boy can miss his mother when caught and held in the white man 's lodges , and that it was only right and just that he , my Indian grandfather , should do this service to the memory of his sleeping daughter , who was my mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Boy right , " he stopped long enough to say . " Me remember duty to mother . That 's why go now . Fast . Before maybe she see me talk with white son . Too bad . Good-bye , white boy . " That , then , was the end of it . He got up on his pony and rode off on the lope , friends following in haste . I ran as far as the river in pursuit , waving and calling for my grandfather to wait . I may as well have been hallooing the wind . Perhaps , better so . The wind sometimes turns around and whistles back .  | My grandfather did not . Neither did his friends . The last I saw of then , they were wading the Missouri at the shallow crossing of the first Mandan village . That was a bad day for me . But those red gods of my mother 's people were watching over me . They did not ride , wary with my grandfather . The very next day , November nth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horse . How may one tell of Sacajawea , or Birdwoman , as the Shoshones translated her name ? She was no more than a girl when we first saw her , sixteen summers Charbonneau said , and she was swollen big with the seventh month of her pregnancy . Yet when she came up the bank of the river to stand before Clark and myself at the construction site , and to murmur in her low voice , " I am Sacajawea , my chiefs , the younger wife of Charbonneau , " I loved her . When she raised her eyes and looked at me , my heart stopped beating . For other women , from that moment , it never beat again . I loved Sacajawea beyond time , beyond place , beyond reason . It was that way in the beginning , that way in the end ; it was the all , the final thing . Even Clark , that rock , that granite carving of a man , felt this power . And I saw him tremble to it , even as I trembled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a jealousy , a challenge , which never was resolved . As for Sacajawea , I thought that even in that opening brief encounter her luminous gaze lingered for a greater time upon the weather-beaten homeliness of the red-haired captain than  | upon my own narrow-faced metis features . But before I might make myself sicker yet from this mean suspicion , Clark , with his rough genius for treating with these simple wilderness folk , nodded to me and said , " Make her welcome , Frank . See what it is that has brought her downriver . Ask about the other squaw , too . I was told by Charbonneau to expect his women , but you 'll grant he did n't prepare its for anything like this . " Since Sacajawea had spoken in French , and since her older companion had said no word at all in any tongue , the onus of obeying my captain 's order was inescapably mine . Very awkwardly , I 'm afraid , I conveyed to the young squaw the questions of the Red Head Chief . She replied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandan towns with her husband , nor had her companion , the older squaw and other wife of the French trapper . But Charbonneau had sent for her , Sacajawea , when it was learned that the American captains sought an interpreter for the Shoshone language . It was thought by Charbonneau , she concluded , that while he earned his money interpreting for the Minnetaree , she might also be earning an equal amount supplying the same service for the Americans in connection with the Shoshone , the Snake Indians , when the expedition should go on , in the spring , to the distant Big Rock Mountains . When Clark had me ask her why it was that she believed she might serve in this capacity  --  what qualification she had for it  --  she replied quietly that she herself was a Shoshone Indian , captured five winters gone as a small girl of eleven years and little knowledge . But she had a good memory , she said , and had not forgotten the tongue of her people , and she was certain that she could help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Considering her tender age when captured , Clark told me he thought it extremely unlikely that she could prove of any real or considerable value as a go-between with the Shoshone , but that I was not to hurt her by revealing this fact . Rather , I was to inform her we were made glad in our hearts to see her and the other squaw , and that they might both camp with us to be near their husband . This I did , and  | Sacajawea , with a sad , soft smile that nearly tore my heart from my breast , thanked us both with a grace of word and gesture which left us , boy and man , blushing like country swains . In this case the woman was a mere girl , and a red Indian ; the swains were the one a half-breed boy of nearly twenty , the other a middle-aging American soldier . There was , too , another factor which I am certain Clark considered as automatically as did I. This would be the husband ; Toussaint ( ; barbonneau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reckon with . But a man who already grew old ; who was gray and grizzled and somewhere upon the immediate approaches to fifty years of age . There was a further element ? the unborn child  --  perhaps more patently a taboo than either Charbonneau 's marital rights , or the disparate ages of Frank Rivet and William Clark . But I knew , as I stared at my captain there upon the bank of the Missouri , and while we both silently watched Sacajawea and the older squaw go down to their canoe and begin its unloading , that it was not alone I who was smitten at first sight with the strangely beautiful and compelling Shoshone girl . Captain Clark built the compound in the form of a triangle , the apex toward the river . He drove us to the task like slaves , the increasing cold being his galley whip . In exactly nine days from the arrival of Sacajawea the last of what the red-haired captain called " our works " was completed . These works consisted of two rows of huts , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more suited to stabling livestock than  | human beings . They were constructed of incredibly heavy ash and cottonwood logs , spongy , wet , fibrous and miserable to trim or shape . The dimensions of each of these " Mandan mansions " were fourteen feet square by seven feet high . Floors were rammed earth , ceilings raw plank . Across the open base of the triangle , inland , the captain installed a stockade of unpeeled poles . The gate was here and it was manned night and day . Since the roofs of the eight-hut triangle ran from a height of seven feet on the inside walls to a lofty eighteen feet on the outer walls , Clark 's " works " in very real effect constituted a superior fortress which , upon the twentieth of November , 1804 , was named by both our captains in formal dress and ceremony Fort Mandan . As a final touch , and as only he might have conceived of it , Clark put up outside the gate a roadside sign containing our latitude of 470 21 ' 47 " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn arrow pointing southward down the rutted river trail and announcing laconically : ST . LOUIS , 1600 MILES . For such acts did his men love him , and for such acts ( lid they separate him from his co-captain and their real commander . It was perhaps not a fair judgment , but a most human one . If the record survives , let it note that nothing so endears the officer to the man as the ability to share a smile . Nor does iron discipline depend upon a steel face . No soldier of our company would have died the slower for Captain Clark than for the other captain . That soldier might leap the more quickly to answer Captain Lewis , but he would not jump harder or farther . A nice distinction , surely , but accurate . With the fort finished and ourselves moved into it  --  none too soon , for upon November 13th we had seen the first block ice floating in the river  --  we were given some time to catch up our unofficial duties , of which I personally had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not seen nor heard of Sacajawea since that first day at the river . Clark told me that Charbonneau had purchased from some visiting Assiniboin Indians a tipi of the portable Sioux design and with this lodge and his two women set off  | " somewhere into the woods . " Indeed , the captain added , Charhonnrv- himself , now many days overdue to report for duty , was being sought by Captain Lewis . Should I see him , I was to report at once . As for Sacajawea and the other squaw , no search had been ordered , nor was any contemplated . This dryly included fact , of course , merely doubled the ardor with which I now took the latter mission upon myself , uncomn-ancled . Yet for six straight days I combed those Mandan timberlands without result . My method was to pose as company meat hunter . My luck ran good and I was thus able to stay in the field with permission . Actually , after the first day , I did not go alone , but persuaded Clark to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my game . It was on the seventh day that the big Negro dropped the towline on the Indian hauling toboggan and turned to me with his first grin since being assigned by his master as my pack animal . " Mister Frank , " he observed , sniffing the cold , flaky air of a swiftly thickening snowfall , " she 's agoing to snow . " " Mister York , " I replied acidly , " she 's done already snowed . Were you thinking of something else , perhaps ? " " Well , yes , sir , could be . How about you ? " " Damn you , " I said , " it 's none of your affair what I 'm thinking of . " " No , sir , " he agreed amiably . " Not less'n you say so . " He fell silent , sniffing the snow again , shaking his head . " She 's agoing to be way too deep for what you 're hunting , Mister Frank , less'n you find her pretty fast , " he announced unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled my supposedly civilized superiority . " York , " I demanded finally , " do you mean to tell me that you 've been hauling that miserable damned sled through these miserable damned woods for all of these miserable damned days knowing what I was looking for and yet you did n't say a miserable damned word the entire time ? " The grin spread , his head bobbing . " Oh , my , much worse than that , Mister Frank , " he said . " I not only done knowed  | what you was looking for , I knowed all the time percisely whar it were . " " York , you do n't mean it ! " " No , sir , not iffen you says so , I do n't . " " No , wait , damn it , that 's not what I meant and you know it . " " Yes , sir , I sure does . " I forced myself to think calmly . " York , old friend , " I said , " forget the hard words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before dark ? " " Course there 's time . She 's only ten minutes from the fort . " I wanted to bend my rifle barrel over his skull . Rather , I smiled forgivingly . " Dear friend , " I requested , " may I , just for the sake of old times down the river and by virtue of the dark-blood bond we share , ask you one simple question before we set out ? " " Why , surely , Mister Frank . You kin ask me anything you wants . And that 's forever so . " " Well , then , " I nodded , gritting my teeth , " if you knew all the time that I was looking for Charbonneau 's young squaw , why in the name of God did n't you tell me where she was ? " York looked at me , eyewhites walled in total innocence of my ire . " Why , Mister Frank , " he said in his gentle lion 's rumble , " that 's a powerful easy question . How am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ... ? " Charbonneau 's squaws showed pleasure at seeing us . They had been these several days without the services of their lord and  | master and evidently they  --  the older one , at least  --  missed those services . This second squaw , a lean and hungry-looking sloe-weasel with a face as angular as Sacajawea 's was oval , demonstrated a degree of cordiality not to be outdone even by our memories of the Ree women . Spying York , as she came out of the cowskin lodge in answer to our hail , her dark features glowed . She called back into the lodge for Sacajawea to come out and see the metis boy , thus nominating herself as the object of the huge slave 's visit . And when that rascal had obligingly patted her on the backside and suggested she come away with him on a sleigh ride through the trees , she lost no time in leaping on the toboggan and yelping at him to " Marchons ! Marchons ! " after the manner with which the northern Indians urge on their sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sacajawea . I turned quickly back to face the Shoshone girl . God 's name , but she was lovely ! I could not speak , could not move , could not even think . " Come in , " she said in decent French , standing aside for me . " A friend of my husband 's is welcome here . " Straightening , I looked at her . " But I am not a friend of your husband 's , " I said . " I do n't like your husband and I do n't trust him . " She returned my look . Lowering her eyes , she again gestured for me to enter . " My husband is a good man , " she said . " Yet you are honest and say what is in your heart . So I will be the same . I like you . You do n't look at an Indian with bad thoughts . I trust you . Come in . " I hesitated , charmed by the Indian thinking , but alerted by it too . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " I said , " please tell me . " " It is all right , " she said . " Is not Wahiki here ? " " Wahiki ? " I asked . " That 's a Sioux name , is n't it ? " " Yes . Hunkpapa Sioux . It means The Bone . You see , Charbonneau bought her from the Sioux . " " A good name for her , Sioux or not , " I replied , smiling .  | Then , when she saw my blush of awkwardness , she at once waved her slim hand . " Excuse it that I do not smile with you , " she said , " but it is that my people are more strict with their women than are some others . " As swiftly as I had blushed , I frowned . " So I have noticed , " I said bluntly , jerking my head toward York and the other squaw . Sacajawea 's patient voice only grew more gentle . " You are forgiven , white boy , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not alone Sioux by name ; she carries the blood , as well . She is no Shoshone sister of mine , as Charbonneau tells it . She is pure Hunkpapa . " " Oh , " I said lamely , " I 'm sorry , Sacajawea . " " It is already forgotten , " she shrugged , face lighting to the sad , sweet smile . " Come in , Frank . " Once more I halted , heart hammering crazily . " How did you know my name ? " I stammered . " From asking about it , and about you , " she admitted . " From Captain Clark ? " I demanded , half angrily . " No , from Charbonneau , of course . " " What ? Your husband ? And he was not jealous ? IIe showed no resentment of your interest in another man ? " " In another man , perhaps . He said you were but a foolish boy . He said when you came to see me it would be permitted that I let you in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ? " " But of course . Charbonneau is very wise . " " Perhaps , but he 's very old , too . I would think he would be suspicious of young men . " " Sometimes he is . " " But not this time , eh ? Not with just a foolish boy ? " She laughed suddenly . It was a soft delicious sound . " Would you be worried when it is plain to all that I am soon to bear a child ? " she asked . " I told you Charbonneau was a wise man . He does n't waste time thinking about useless things . Come in , Frank , it 's too cold standing here in this wind . "  | Wv spoke of many things . Sacajawea was not shy , but appealingly soft of speech and manner . And she was gracefully feniinine beyond any woman I had seen . Even bulky with child she was a creature of desire and exquisite femaleness . As she told me now of her past and present life , I watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , a slender girl . Her head was not elongated , as so many of the Indians , but rather small and round , Caucasian in shape . So , too , were her features Caucasian . Small ears lay flat to her head . The short straight nose was neither flatly Mongol like the river Indians , nor highbridged as with the horse Indians . Her mouth , a little wide in the manner of Indian mouths , still had a form and softness not at all Indian . The teeth , of course , were perfect ; I had not seen a healthy adult of her high plains race who did not have perfect teeth . But her eyes remained the most startling thing about her , even more so than the rare dark auburn color of her hair . They were not black or even dark or light brown in the normal Indian range of iris pigments . They were gray . They were as gray as my own eyes , although far , far darker , with that certain hint of green-blue seen in deep clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudless sunset ; and the lashes which framed them were thick as broomstem grasses . Her skin was a tigerish color , so light in tone that each blush was to be seen in Sacajawea 's face as vividly as in the face of the fairest French or American girl . Yet with all this strange beauty , she was always the purest of pure Indians . One may say that being French and very young I add qualities to the Shoshone girl which no Indian maiden ever knew . The charge is fair but not true . Sacajawea was not only an uncommonly pretty young girl , she was a regal woman by any standard of any race . No man who ever knew her , was quite the same again . Nor was it beauty alone which summed her gifts . Grace was hers , and good manners . Intelligence she had , and a lively humor with quick though gentle tongue . Dignity covered her every move . She could look like a queen while gutting an elk or jerking the boudins from the hot stinking  | belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had no crown but her auburn brown hair , no gemmed circlet save the brightness of her smile , no scepter but the crude stone maul which crushed Charbonneau 's cornmeal or drove the stakes of his hide tipi . But Sacajawea was a ruler of men 's hearts by God 's will . I knew this with the first word she spoke to me upon the banks of the Missouri , and I knew it now , as I sat in the lodge of Charbonneau and listened , heart afire , to her softly haunting voice . She came to the end , moving her hands like fluttering birds , dark gray eyes shining in the half-light of the lodge . " And so , " she murmured , " there is my story . I t is not , as I warned you , a simple tale . We are all the same , red and white . Our stories are of much trouble and little joy , but we all see a better sunrise coming on the next day . I t is as it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I answered her as briefly as courtesy would permit , giving the plain facts of my history from the Pawnee camp to the college of the Jesuits . When I had concluded , she nodded soberly . " Then it is true that you are metis , as Charbonneau told me , " she said . " We are half-brother and half-sister , you and I. That 's good . I like that . " " I 'm not so certain that I do , " I replied . " It is not exactly as a sister that I view you . " I was bold with it and she understood my meaning . " We must talk of other things , " she said , gray eyes holding mine . " There is the matter of your father . " " Yes , " I agreed , deserving the rebuke . " I was swept away with the tale of your Shoshone childhood , your capture by the Minnetaree , the manner in which Charbonneau was able to purchase you for a broken rifle and five old horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Achille Rivet . " " I know , " she said . " You 're a good boy . " " I am bordering nineteen years old ! " I said indignantly . " Among your people a man is grown at seventeen , ready for his first warhorse and journey to battle when he is eighteen .  | And I am one-half horse Indian . I think I 'm ready for my pony and my first fight . Yes , and for my first love , too . " She shrugged . I could see the curving gleam of her bare shoulders beneath the loosened fur cape . " Frank , " she said , " what makes a man different from a boy ? Or a girl from a woman ? Is it the years alone ? I do n't believe it . Thinking only of the hardships I have known , I am sixty winters old . Considering only those few happy times of my life , I am my actual age , sixteen summers young . So what am I really ? A woman or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , " I said . " The most beautiful of both that I have ever seen . " She blushed deeply . " Beauty is like age , " she said . " It depends upon who is describing it . I am certain that Toussaint Charbonneau sees me one way , and Frank Rivet sees me another way , and Captain Clark sees me yet a third way . That , too , is life . " I threw all caution to the snow-thick winds at the mention of the red-headed captain . " Sacajawea , " I shouted jealously , " I love you ! I do n't care what Charbonneau or Clark see in you . I love you and shall wait for you and follow you until death moves between us . God help me ! " She might have laughed at the unguarded outburst , charitably passing by the excited speech as no more than illadvised ardor . But it was more than that , and she sensed that it was . " Frank , " she said , " there is something you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling . I understand it ; I know what it is . Its fire leaped up in my own breast that moment when I looked up the riverbank toward you and the red-haired captain . But it was not you , Frank , for whom the fire leaped . " She stopped , head lowered , not looking at me . My throat grew tight . I had been right from the first moment of my jealousy ! That look which I fancied to see upon her lovely face when her eyes met Clark 's had not been fancied by me but real ; as real as the buffet of the wind beyond Charbonneau 's lodge , and the sting of the woodsmoke within that lodge . If my life belonged to the Shoshone girl , her life belonged to  | the man who above all other men had treated Frank Rivet as a human being . Her life belonged in the end to the same man as did mine . We were both bonded to Captain William Clark ! No , it was worse than simply bonded . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ; for Sacajawea could no more be his mate in reality than could I be his son . Still , we had come too far , Sacajawea and I , to turn back now . If she did not love me as a lover , if she could not answer to my own devotion , to my own passion , then we would go on as she felt it , as half-brother and half-sister of the Indian side . There could be no question , for me ever , of abandoning the slender Shoshone . I now told her so , and she accepted the situation . " All right , Brother . " She smiled . " For now it is the better way . We have a common desire , Frank , but it is not love . We both came to this place seeking the Shoshone Indians , you to find your lost father , I to rejoin my people with whom I shall then stay while Charbonneau travels on to the Big Blue Water with the American captains . " I nodded , her sober words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , you are right , " I said . " We both have the Shoshone to find before anything else . Indeed , as to that , what a blessing the good God has sent me in Sacajawea . " She looked at me quietly for a moment . Then , once more , the sad , swift smile brightened her dusky face . " More blessing than you yet imagine , Brother Frank , " she said . " For we not only look for the Shoshone together , but we look for the same band of that people . It is my own tribe , Frank , which holds your father . I have sat as close to him as I do to you , across this smoking fire . "  | I was stunned , of course . It was a typically Indian revelation . She had known of my mission all this while , yet had chosen her own time and way in which to arrive at this bit of news for which I had labored like a galley rogue sixteen hundred miles up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not another human soul , not Charbonneau , not Wahiki , not anyone but Frank Rivet had been told this peculiar secret . That , as well , was the Indian way , and the way which made them such devils to deal with , innocent and friendly , or wicked and dire . " Good God ! " I breathed at last . " Why have n't you told me this before ? " Now the graceful shrug was back , the gleaming copper nakedness again showing briefly beneath the soft fur . " You gave me no time , " she explained . " Well , there is scarcely time remaining , " I said , " but please hurry . York and I must leave , or the captains will be out looking for us . " She tried then to tell me what she could of my father but it proved maddeningly little . Achille Rivet had been brought into her village only a short time prior to her own capture by the Minnetaree . She had meant to ask her brother , who was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner was called " the dead man " and why , indeed , the Shoshone had purchased him from the Teton Sioux . But the Minnetarees had struck the Snake lodges before she remembered to put the question and so this was all she actually knew of Achille Rivet , who was called the dead man . She was sorry . Did I forgive her ?  | Why , I could not say , but the mention of her brother being an important chief among the Shoshone caught my ear . An intuitive impulse told me to inquire about this young chief , and about the name of the band from whence he and Sacajawea came . But I had no more than posed the questions for my companion , and she no more than commenced to reply to them  --  first pledging me to hard secrecy , since even Charbonneau did not know she was the young sister of this powerful young chief  --  when there was a sudden rattle at the entrance flaps and the older squaw , Wahiki , parted the closed skins and dropped down on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point York interrupted , protruding his head through the unfastened flaps and waving to me in some urgency . " Come on along , Mister Frank , " he said , " we 'd best light a shuck out'n here . She 's most dark and set to snow like hell . Ai n't you done palavering yet ? " " No , " I said irritably . " Come in and close the flaps . There are a couple of important things I must find out from Sacajawea ; her folks have turned out to be the ones that are holding my father . " He obeyed me , black face beaming happily . " Why , say , ai n't that a passing grand piece of news , Mister Frank ? This here little old Snake squaw 's kin being the ones to have your daddy ? " I agreed that it was indeed good news and turned once more to query Sacajawea about her band and brother . But again bad luck dogged the day . Before she might even open her mouth to begin her reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Clark 's shaggy red head , dusted white with snowflakes , which intruded abruptly . " You lads had better be heading for home , " he advised , eyes snapping . " Charbonneau is not five minutes behind me ; I saw him saying good-bye to Captain Lewis as I set out from the fort just now . Eh , hello there , is that you , Charbonneau ? " Of course it was not Charbonneau , and Clark was only terrorizing us , but how could we know ? With him we went  | trotting through the early night , entirely grateful for the falling snow . Yet even as we went and even as I ought to have been burning with embarrassment over being caught with a young married girl in her lodge in her trusting husband 's absence , I was not . I was aflame with another feeling altogether . What was Captain Clark really doing at the hidden lodge of Sacajawea at darkfall of that cold and snowy night ? Heart of Jesus , how I envied him then the love of Charbonneau 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort and when I had learned that Charbonneau had indeed reappeared , Clark sent for me . I suspected at once that he had serious matters in mind , and he did . " Frank , " he said , " I wo n't mince words with you . It 's time we had it out in the open about the Shoshone girl . It 's this simple ; she 's Charbonneau 's wife . Do you understand what I mean ? " " I have n't touched her ! " I said defiantly . " There 's nothing to understand . " " " Oh yes there is , " he said quietly . " You 're gone on her , lad , and it ca n't do either of you anything but harm . " " He paused and I eyed him sullenly . " Never mind the hard looks . " He nodded . " I know what 's eating you and it 's not dismal as you think . I have no time or temper for that girl , Frank . You hear me ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me and was trying to bluff me away from seeing her again .  | " Oui , Patron , " I replied , still scowling . " I hear you all too well . " He took me by the shoulder . The grip made me gasp . " Damn you , boy , " he said , " do n't you turn ugly on me . " He stood looking at me a long , angry moment , then eased his grip . He heaved a sigh , shoulders sagging . " It 's no fault of yours , blast it , " lie said . " She 's enough to uncenter any man alive . " I nodded , saying nothing . " Frank , " he went on , " when we set out this spring , Sacajawea will stay here . I mean to tell Charhonneau that 's definite ; he 's been after me to take her along . But with the baby delivered and her shape back , Lord knows what hard grief she would be to us all . Fact is , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , Frank , you and me will view it as two men who know where we 're going and what we 're doing . I take you to be a man , you see , and I expect you to behave as one . What do you say ? " Well , in truth what might I say ? That I hated him ? That he was a base liar ? That I suspected he was sneaking out to see Sacajawea ? That I figured he was trying to throw inc off the scent , while he ran it hot and heavy ? I knew better than that . The fact the Shoshone girl had a deep feeling for this stout red-headed captain did not enter him into the same guilty column . Captain William Clark thought first of his men and his mission , and no Indian girl would change that . " I say I 'm sorry , Patron , " I admitted , head hung . " It 's a bad thing to feel as I do about that girl . It makes me unequal to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stage of it , " he told me . " Work will do wonders meanwhile . And that I can give you . " He was as good as his word . He put such labor upon me that the wonder was I lived , much less thought of love . He kept me by his side , sleeping and waking . Our days together were sixteen and eighteen hours long . I even forgot the days altogether . They slid into weeks , and the weeks into months , and still he drove me.  | When there came a day too bitter of weather for work , he would take me hunting . Often , on these trips , we would be away from the fort overnight , or even several nights , sleeping as we could in the open where darkness found us . One night the temperature on Captain Lewis 's gauge was twenty-one degrees below zero when we dug our sleeping holes in the snow , and when we burrowed out next morning the mercury stood at thirty-eight degrees below . It was only the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five degrees below zero , seventy-four degrees below the freezeline . We barely got back alive to the fort and would have died had such weather caught us any farther off than we were . As it was , fifteen Indians froze to death in open camps that terrible night , and Captain Clark was treating frostbite victims the whole of the following day . He saved many a blackened limb for the Mandans , too , and his reputation climbed mightily among them . When the cursed northern winter gripped the land in this deathhold of subfrost , when neither timber nor hunting parties might be abroad , Clark still had work to spare . These times I would be put to sorting coal for the blacksmiths , and carrying it to the smithing forges , stoking their tempering fires , manning their bellows , whatever hot and dirty work needed doing . These smiths were engaged in making war axes for the Mandans , who would trade nearly anything for one of the cheap iron weapons . Indeed , even for a 4x4-inch scrap of sheet metal , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would offer a complete storage hole of unshelled ears . Of course , when such whole grain arrived , it needed to be shelled off the cob and quite naturally Frank Rivet was given this privilege , too . In the very heart of this terrible cold we were amazed to have an English visitor from Assiniboine River , a Mr. Hugh Ilcney , who had traveled nine days by dogsled with two Indian companions through this hell of glare ice and killing frost . He proved an extremely lively fellow and Captain Lewis entertained him much . With my half-breed 's suspicious nature  | I doubted the validity of any such Canadian North West or Hudson 's Bay Company employee , and it was a fact that when Mr. Hugh Heney departed back into the snowy north , it was not three days when Charbonnean again disappeared , this time seemingly for good . The Mandan chief Black Cat advised Captain Lewis that Charbonncau had a history of friendliness with the British , but Lewis would have none of such " unfounded camp gossip . " For myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of his wife . I longed forthwith to go and see Sacajawea once more . Clark had the antidote for that . He put me with the carpentering crew finishing the interiors of the fort rooms . The last of this labor was done December 24th , Christmas Eve . Clark told the Mandans , who visited us incessantly , that the next day was a holy day for white men and that the Indians must not come to the fort . He then shut the gates , issued two gills of whiskey per man and ordered a company dance . All hands fell to singing carols and trading their entire winter 's pay or dearest possessions for the next man 's issue of liquor . I was able to deal off nny own two cups of the poison to good friend George Shannon for a beautiful Kentucky rifle which thence forward was my constant comrade of the trail . Christmas day we all rested . Next dawn the slave labor resumed , Clark this time detailing me to a forage unit sent to help the Mandans cut green cottonwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . It was remarkable how these little Indian ponies would stay fat on the tough , fibrous sticks of wood , but they did so . Considering that their adoring owners kept them in their lodges with them the winter through , these Mandan mounts were among the most interesting thing about that gentle and cultured people . It was no wonder the Sioux coveted such animals and no wonder the British traders would come nine days by dogsled from Assinihoine River , or three weeks by snowshoe from Turtle Mountain , to dicker for these pampered yet indestructible small brutes which could " run like foxes and fight like wolves . " Still , by the time I had frostbitten my fingers and cut my  | hands four times with the harvesting knife to feed the shaggy devils their damnable twigs , I would not have traded one gallon of shelled corn for a Mandan lodgeful of them . lint things were only commencing to tighten . When we had " hayed in " enough " boughs " to keep the little brutes temlporarily from starving , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Charbonneau were truly away from home . Clark , of course , caught me at the gate . He had his rifle and a squad of eight armed men behind him in marching order , and I knew trouble was somewhere not far from Fort Mandan . " Bon jour , Patron , " I greeted him warily , " what is it that threatens ? " " Oh , nothing much , Frank . " He waved . " We hear there 's some Sioux about and we 're heading down to the south cache to pick up a load of meat in case it 's true . " I noted then that the men were dragging the meat sled . " Where is your black packhorse , Patron ? " I asked , not seeing York . " Has he finally run off with the Indians ? " " No , but you 're warm . He was in more trouble with some Mandan 's wife last night . Captain Lewis has him under key for the day . Fall in . " " Fall in , Patron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , you 're the only scout I 've got left . Shannon and the others are all out looking for Charbonneau . Step lively now . All right , men , follow me . " I set off by his side , not unflattered even though circumvented . I nodded with some show of esprit , even . " You may count on my lively step , Patron , " I said , grinning . " I 'll bet I can , " he promised with a side look . " Especially if these Sioux turn out to be the Teton , eh ? " I dropped the grin and said no more . Somehow , Captain Clark always arranged to have the last worth-while word .  | To hold our meat supplies we had built stout hens of logs , strong enough to keep out bears and other prowling beasts . These were like hog pens roofed over and with trapdoors of solid planking , which Clark kept under padlock and key . We had six of these meathouses scattered up and down the river and , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , Clark had asked for some Mandan horses to help haul back our heavy sled . These animals and their three owners met us outside the fort a short ways , the whole party going cautiously down the north bank to the cache . I worked out ahead , with one of the Mandans . His name was Shahaka . It meant The Big White , and he was the first chief of the lower village . He was reputed to be a scout of note . I guess he had been told the same lie about me , for the truth was that both of us talked a great deal in French and ** a respectable amount of my tobacco and neither one of us so much as suspected an enemy to be within smokedrift . In fact , we walked squarely into the waiting circle of the Teton Sioux war party at the cache , still talking and puffing at our pipes . " Greetings , " signed the Sioux leader , a knife-cut murderer with a smile like a hunting lynx . " You are welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swept a long arm about the clearing which contained the meat cache . " We 've been waiting for you a long time . You took long enough to get down here . Come on , hurry up . Open the trap . We want this meat . " By this time he spied Clark and the rest of the company drawing closer across the ice of the frozen river . " Aha ! " He brightened . " Is n't that kind of them ? They even thought  | to bring a sled and some ponies to draw it , so that we would not have to pack the meat on our own horses . Only a Mandan could lae so kind . " Slialiaka and I exchanged glances , weighing our chances of making a break for it while the Sioux were momentarily distracted by the view of Clark and the meat sled . Evidently the Mandan 's mind worked like my own , for when I bolted , he bolted , and we both raced shamelessly as any other two cowards toward the captain and his soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wounds . However , our flight drew Clark into great trouble . He saw us coming and dashed at once to meet us , which was precisely what the damned Tetons wanted . They had laid up a number of their fellows in ambush of the river crossing , and Clark and our riflemen , running in off the ice , came squarely into this ambush . Of course , Clark fought his way out with truly admirable effect , getting his squad free of the surround with no serious casualties , but all too late , regardless . Before he might prevent it , the Mandan pony owners had given over their mounts to the Sioux and the latter had shot the lock off the meat pen . It was then but the work of five minutes for the Tetons to load the sled with our primest buffalo ribs and sides of elk , leap on the sled and drive it off into the woods yelling and laughing and firing their trade muskets in happy abandon . We were helpless to pursue them with our small band ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all well mounted on picked winter ponies . Hence it was over and done with in ten minutes ' time , and all we had to show for our valiant stand-off of the hated Teton was the fact that not a man had been wounded except for Shahaka , who got his injury diving under a down log to hide until the firing fell off . " Well , boys , " said Clark , examining the near-empty meat pen , " there 's scarce enough to bother backpacking to the fort . I reckon we 'd best just build us up a bonfire and hold a roast elk and hump-rib feed here and now . It 's too infernal cold and mean with this wind for us to start back without rest and hot food . "  | The others agreed , as they always did with " Captain Will . " We began at once to lay the fire and get out the cuts of meat we wanted to roast . We had only begun to spit the frozen meat on green cottonwood boughs when one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a dark red hand . " Listen , " he said in French . We all listened . There is something about the sound of that order given in the wilderness among desperate men which commands attention . And as we listened , so we heard . The sound was wailing , long-drawn and menacing . It was a sound which has put up the hackles of fear in mankind since the first fire in the first cave . We all recognized it , yet knew , instinctively , that something was strangely different about it ? something chillingly odd and wrong . We all looked at the Mandan . Clark , it was , who moved over to the Indian 's side and said quietly , " Wolves ? " The Mandan shook his head . He was gray with fear . " Not just wolves , " he said . " That is the death-howl sound . They have the madness in them . Le furieux . " " My God , " said Clark softly . " Hydrophobia ? " The Mandan bobbed his head . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " Oui , Patron , " he said , " la hydrophobie . And coming this way . They have smelled the meat . What must we do ? " Clark shook his head and scowled . " We ca n't run for it . That 's the one thing we ca n't do . They will attack anything that moves . " " That is true , " said Shahaka . " Shall we climb into the trees ? " " In this cold ? I think not . If they stay around the pen more than an hour or so , we would freeze up in the trees waiting for them to go . No , we 'll have to fight them on the ground  --  somehow . " " One bite , one scratch , " began Shahaka , but Clark cut him off . " I know that . Be quiet . Think , do n't whine . "  | I le ran his eyes around the meat-pen clearing . Even for him the situation was a close thing . I could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tanned cheeks . The hoarse , unnatural howling of the wolf pack broke suddenly , unexpectedly nearer . " Captain , " I said in English , so as not to alarm the Mandan , " if we are going to make a stand , let us fort up . " " Eh ? " he said , almost distractedly . " How 's that , boy ? " " The meat pen , " I said . " It will hold us all . Let 's get into it before those mad devils do . " He whirled on me , blue eyes alight . " By the Lord ! " he shouted . " That 's it . Grab those Indians before they bolt . Inside , everybody ! " But the idea , if valid , was already too late . Two of the Mandans , terrified by the burst of nearby howling , suddenly broke and darted for the river . Our men started after them , but Clark bellowed at them to come back , to let the Indians go . This they did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white-faced . With the third Mandan , Shahaka , we all ran for the meat pen . Clark stood aside until the last of us were safely into it . Then , just as the rabid pack surged from the dark timber , he scrambled in and slammed shut the overhead trapdoor . The movement was so close to fatal lateness that the reaching jaws of one of the brutes cut six inches of rawhide fringe from the wrist of his hunting coat . " Did he get you , Captain , " I muttered huskily , afraid myself to look at the big-boned wrist . But Captain Clark was not thinking of himself or of his life . He was peering between the unchinked logs of the meat pen , out over the glare ice of the frozen river . " Do n't worry about me , " he said . " Pray for those poor devils out there . " All eyes moved to the six black dots far out on the ice . Two were human dots , we knew . But the four behind the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified , our own desperate situation for the moment forgotten . We saw the wolves come up to the fleeing Mandans , heard the twin  | reports of the two Indian muskets , saw two of the wolves drop to the shots . We then saw the remaining two close on the redmen . There was a flash of knife and of clubbed musket and foam-flecked yellow canine teeth in the pale light of the January sun . The remaining two wolves were killed and left limp upon the river ice . The two Mandans continued toward the dark trees on the far side of the river . But there was a difference now . Now , as they ran , they limped . " God , " said one of the men softly . " So much for praying . " It was in that instant that Shahaka , alone among us not held aghast at the fate of his fellows , cried out to Clark in sudden , strident warning ; " Patron ! Behind you  --  I " We all wheeled from the riverward wall of the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the wolf , and saw that it had somehow found an aperture in the pen through which it had forced its body . We stood paralyzed as it singled out Captain Clark and launched itself through the air at his face . It was then that Shahaka hurled himself between them ; and then that we heard the great jaws of the wolf go home in the Mandan 's upper chest . All I remembered was the smoke and roar of my Kentucky rifle . I did not remember shouldering or aiming the long weapon . The heavy bullet of zoo grains struck the attacking wolf behind the left ear , shattering its spine and the base of its inflamed brain . It died instantly and before it might make more than the one tearing slash at brave Shahaka 's body . As it fell away from the Indian , Shahaka staggered and I leaped to support him .  | " Do n't touch him ! " shouted Clark . I drew back , Shahaka sinking to the dirt floor . " Move away ! " Clark ordered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its belt scabbard and for a moment I thought he meant to kill Shahaka , ** to protect us from the Indian 's infection or to spare the poor fellow his own misery of pain and terror . But I was still far from knowing my captain . The pistol belched its cloud of sooted flame toward the far side of the pen . Then I saw the second wolf halfway through the opening which had been discovered by its mate . Clark 's ball took the brute in the face and it died as suddenly as had the first . Its deep-furred body , looking enormous at such near range , remained wedged in the entrance way , which now appeared to be the fault of one log having been chewed away by some marauding bear or wolverine . The dead wolf 's carcass blocked this dangerous flaw for the moment and Clark said calmly , " Well , Frank , that was a nice shot you made . Risky but good . Come over here with your powder horn . " I moved to his side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told him , still breathing hard . " What about Shahaka , sir ? " " Shahaka is next , " he said , unsheathing his knife . It went quickly and very quietly from there . Only the sibilant breathing of the watching men , and the tooth-set pain noise of the injured Mandan broke the stillness . Clark opened the fang wounds with his blade , making a crude cross-cut at each mark the wolf had put in Shahaka 's skin . When he had the wounds thus incised and bleeding freely , he took snow which had sifted through the open chinks of the log pen and washed the wounds repeatedly , flushing away the blood , scrubbing clean the edges of all the lacerations . He would allow none of us to touch the wound , or to help with the work in any way except to bring him snow . He also ordered that none of us touch or go near the old snow from the woundwashing , which he discarded into a neat pile in one corner of the pen . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he washed his own hands and forearms in fresh snow , and turned to me.  | " Now the powder horn , Frank , " he said . I gave it to him , unstoppered , and he poured a trail of the black powder into all the wounds , mounding it high at each site . " Flint ! " he barked over his shoulder to me , and I struck it for him and got the pinch of moss fanned into life and handed it to him . He held its burning small torch , looking down at the dark-eyed Mandan . " Shahaka , " he said , " you must lie still while this medicine works . To help you I am going to have a man set on each of your arms and legs . Do you understand ? " The Mandan shook his head , and I repeated the directions for him in French . Then he smiled . " I will need no men on my body . The wolf has bitten me but I am not afraid . I know you , Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held him down , nonetheless . Clark lit the gunpowder with the moss fusee . It flared and ran . We could hear and smell the cooked flesh . Shahaka writhed beneath us like a red snake , then in a moment lay quiet . We got to our feet . " From here , " said Clark , " he 'll need a bigger doctor . " On our way back up the river we kept watch for any return of the wolf pack . The rabid brutes had departed after we had shot half a dozen of their mates and the survivors had devoured the wounded brothers still alive . Ten minutes after the close of this bloody meal we were silently crossing the river on the ice , each man praying fervently that no " wolf dots " would appear behind us . They did not , and now we were nearing the fort with still no sign of discovery by the ravening pack . Just south of the fort we came up with the two Indians who had fled and been attacked and bitten by the wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine their hurts . Clark tried to help them , to do for them what he had for Shahaka , but the circvmsta ! ices were different . Here he had no absolute authority , and the redmen did not have to submit as Shahaka had in the meat pen . Nor would they . When Shahaka showed them his chest by way of convincing example of the Red Head Chief 's medicine , his two fellows took exception to the fact that he , in their words , looked " like a piece of bullfat which has fallen in the fire , " and refused absolutely to allow Clark to come near them . They had , they claimed , big medicine of their own for bites of the mad animal , and this they would trust before any " cooking medicine " of the Red Head Chief . Shahaka , when queried by Clark as to this mystery cure for hydrophobia , was assured that the Mandan did possess such a medicine , which was made from the pulverized roots of a certain plant . Upon an agreement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our captain reluctantly permitted the two bitten Mandans to stay by their trail fire , untreated . After we had gone on a ways , I asked him privately if he thought such a miracle  --  a medicinal cure for the bite and resultant disease which had held humanity in dread for centuries  --  did , indeed , or could possibly , indeed , exist here among the Mandan , and he only shook his head grimly . " Frank , " he said , " roots or no roots , I would n't trade places with those poor devils for all of the Louisiana and the Columbia and Canada together , with a guaranteed map of the Northwest Passage thrown in . Inside thirty days they 'll start the first signs . Then you wo n't even be able to say , God help them , ' because not God , nor nobody , can help them then . " " How about Shahaka ? " I asked . " Shahaka 's got a good chance . We got him fast and scrubbed him deep and burnt him severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We talked no more then , for uptrail we saw a familiar figure approaching on a sharp dogtrot . It was Charbonneau , shown up again and carrying urgent news for our blunt-jawed company " physician . "  | " Can you come , Capitainer ' " He panted . " It is Sacajawea . Her time has come , but the baby will not move out . " I could see Clark 's ruddy color lighten . " How long has she labored ? " he said . " Since this morning . " " My God , man , it 's four o'clock in the afternoon ! " " Oui , Patron ; that 's why I have come for you . " " Why not sooner ? " demanded Clark , hard-eyed . " I have been away , Patron . Only this noon ( lid I come back . You know I have been trying to find out something about the British for you . " Again Clark eyed him . " Yes , " he said icily . " Either that , or something about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Shut up , " said Clark , " and lead the way . " Clark got the baby that night . He did it with the potion of crushed rattlesnake buttons which was Indian medicine , pure and simple . Sacajawea , fourteen hours in hard labor , the baby coming breech-to and her first child , had been near death from exhaustion . Clark gave the powdered rattles only in final desperation . He had no idea they might work . And who but Cod can say ? The fact remains that twelve minutes after their administration the young wife of Toussaint Charbonneau was cleanly delivered of a healthy male child . We all thanked le bon Dieu , except the weary and triumphant Clark . The latter came to me outside the snow-whipped tipi of Charbonneau , where , with York , I waited hunched beneath my winter furs , and said , " It 's a boy . I 've named him Pompey for Roman reasons . " When , in response to this news , I breathed thanks to our deity , he grimaced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank that of the Indians . It was that red recipe of those rattler buttons that delivered her . They do what the Indians told us . You never saw such smooth and strong contractions of big muscle in your life . " That was William Clark : engineer , doctor , soldier , frontiersman , midwife , chemist , mechanic , boatman , cartographer , Indian fighter , Indian lover , explorer , plainsman , river pilot ,  | siInph ' believer and captain of American Presidents . What Clark could not do , was not worth doing . Souu  --  how , though , his comment struck me as callous . " Why did n't you name him Frank , or Bill , or Meriwether ? " I cornIllalieeef . " You know , something to remember at least one of us . V but has Pompey got to do with it ? " Clark did n't seem to hear . Ile struck one knotted fist against the other , eyes blazing with pride . " Pomp , " he repeated , as though to himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad . " Well , I was happy as well , I suppose . Yet , from the moment when her child became an actuality , the Shoshone girl , as I saw her , was changed . The child was indeed Charbonneau 's , but Clark 's by right of saving . Their claims to him , also gave the two men claims to Sacajawea , which I might not share . The thought would not leave me . It stayed with me all of the following month of February , into the first week of March and the breaking up of the river ice ; then , toward midMarch and the threshhold of that springtime which would see us embarked again up the Missouri into the unknown territories of the Assiniboin , the Sioux , the Absaroka and the Snake . In the whole time I did not go near Sacajawea , or the cowhide lodge of Toussaint Charbonneau . I worked with my captains and my comrades , trying to forget the girl in preparing for the continuance of the adventure . The effort was heroic but absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of the haunting dark gray eyes did not follow me . There were diversions , true . For example , that notable eighth of March , upon which we received word that the great Le Borgne had come down to Black Cat 's village and wanted to see the American captains . Both captains , York , myself , Charbonneau , and six picked men of our company composed the party which went up to the lodge of the Mandan to meet with the famed " One-Eyed " chief of the savage Minnetaree . We were seated by rank , which gave me the very good position of being to the left of Clark , while York crouched , as ever , to his right .  | The council was to begin , as always , with the pipe-smoking by all white and Indian hands of the great aromatic tobacco of the Americans . But the instant that Le Borgne stalked into the lodge and saw York , the visiting chief literally dropped his pipe and his reaching tobacco-hand , to stare in disbelief . This condition was compounded when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant slave uncoiled his near seven feet of black bone and muscle to " stand for examination , " as his master succinctly put it . Le Borgne was totally bemused . He walked around and around York . IIe measured him with his spread arms for width , and with his rifle barrel for height . He felt of the kinky wool which capped his bullet head , then tried rubbing off his black color by spitting on his own fingers and scrubbing vigorously with them on the slave 's hide . When York 's pigment failed to come off , Le Borgne pronounced the towering slave a bona fide wonder and offered Captain Clark twelve prime ponies and two virgin daughters for him . Clark did not accept the deal and , after another hour of smoking up our tobacco , the Minnetaree leader got up from the fire and without another word of thanks or farewell stalked out of Black Cat 's lodge . Immediately after his exit there was a commotion outside the lodge and a very frightened Indian woman ran inside from the village street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Black Cat . This woman , Black Cat nervously informed Lewis , was one of the wives of Le Borgne . She had deserted the head chief in favor of a man who had been her lover before she wed the One-Eyed . Now the man had abandoned her and she had been hiding from Le Borgne 's embarrassed anger in her father 's lodge . Thinking to gain some intercession from the American captains , apparently , she had come to Black Cat 's lodge in this reckless manner . Almost before this could be told Lewis , Le Borgne himself had come back into the lodge to stand looking calmly at his faithless mate . Seeming to dismiss her , he sat down again and smoked an entire pipe with Lewis and Black Cat , passing the  | time in a discussion of Indian morals in such matters . He explained that to steal a wife was a transgression which might ordinarily be settled by a gift of a good horse to the insulted Iiiislratul by the repentant thief . Another moderate settlement might be achieved where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , said the Minnetaree chief , he had so forgiven another wife not long ago . She was quite young and had eloped with a youth of her own years . Feeling herself wrong , she had returned voluntarily to Le Borgne . He had then sent for the guilty young man , who naturally feared the worst . However , Le Borgne had only asked him and the young wife if they still loved one another , and when they honestly and bravely admitted that they did , he had told them to go with his blessings and be happy , and he added that he had even given them a fat young mare to carry their belongings . At the same time , he wanted the white captains to understand that a situation like this present one with the older wife was another kettle of boiled dog altogether . When a man and a woman made a voluntary elopement and then the man spurned the woman , the husband 's honor was placed in impossible shadow . Some discipline must be visited upon the woman in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans would excuse him while he carried out this necessary punishment . Thinking he meant merely to whip the woman , shameful treatment but not serious , Clark and Lewis nodded their agreement . Le Borgne , taking the piteously weeping wife by the hair , led her to the doorway of the lodge and there killed her with a single blow of his tomahawk , letting the body fall across the entrance . Stepping over it , he said to Black Cat , and as calmly as he had talked with Lewis and Clark , " She was a Mandan , Pocopsahe . If any of her relatives wish to look for me , I will be in my lodge . " Amazingly , Black Cat only replied , " No one will come from my people ; the woman was wrong . " There they left it and there Clark told Lewis we would be wisest to leave it . All of us returned to the fort not very hungry for the noon meal .  | Other " diversions , " and some as fearsome , followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , March 9th , one of the Indians who had been bitten by the wolves complained of stiffness in the neck and an inability to swallow water . Recognizing the dread signs , the brave Mandan went into the timber beyond the village and shot himself through the head . l l is fellows burned the body and buried the ashes deep in the forest . Clark explained to me that the delay in symptorns developing was probably due to the fact the fellow had been bitten in the legs , the poison thus taking longer to travel to the brain . " He said that evidently the other Mandan had not taken the disease . But he was wrong . Three days later , March izth , the second of the bitten Indians felt the stiffness and the morbid fear of taking water . Moreover , he showed in the deep , odd croaking of his voice that terrible " sign " which marks the disease in its furious stage . Taking the warning , his fellow Mandans bore the poor fellow on a willow matting to the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the freezing cold , no cover but the stout boards of the trapdoor , no bed but the mothy wool of an old Buffalo robe . He began to cry out like a wolf in eight hours . By nightfall he was foaming at the mouth and biting the wooden pales of his cage . He died in unspeakable torture during the black-cold belly of the following night . The Mandan heaped dried faggots on the pen and burned it to tiie ground . They then carried all its ashes to the river and let them be " made clean again " by the Mini Sosi , the mud-painted waters of their Mother Missouri . Shahaka , the chief Clark had treated , remained well and of good spirit . " Fool 's luck , " Clark called it , but the awed Mandans knew better . From that day no least wish of the Red Head Chief went untended among them . In three days , March 15th , Charbonne:ni disappeared again . Two days later Shahaka , moved apparently by gratitude , came to report that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four British agents in the forest . More , he  | had risked his life to creep in close and hear what was being said . And what was being said was that Charbonneau should desert the Americans after leading them astray when they went on , and that he should work among the Mandan , meanwhile , to incite them to revolt against the Americans even before the expedition might again move on . Faced with this information upon his return , Charbonneau unexpectedly confessed and Captain Lewis , even more unexpectedly , forgave him and rehired him as our Minnetaree guide and interpreter . To my astonishment , Captain Clark agreed . " Do n't fret , Frank , " he replied , grinning , when I had made known my outrage at this leniency . " A thief took in the act most often makes the holiest saint of all . From here on , old Touissant will be so feared we 're trailing him , he 'll likely behave pure and mild as sweet milk . Besides , I 'm going to take along a little antidote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " When I pressed him for the answer to this " insurance , " he grinned again , and shrugged in his simple way . " It 's Shahaka , " he said . " I 'm asking Captain Lewis to sign him on as our guide to the Snake country . Shahaka claims he 's been there , all the way to the Big Rock Mountains , and Charbonneau ai n't . The captain wo n't be too keen , but he 'll give in . He 's a mite doubtful of Indians , you 'll recall . " " Yes , " I nodded , " and of half-Indians , too . " Clark passed the remark by and we said no more . The days were now spent increasingly in the work of preparation to travel on . The men wove boat cords and towropes of wound grass and braided elkhide . Others toiled at building the  | six new small canoes which , with our two old pirogues , would compose the fleet for our renewed assault on the Upper Missouri . The big keelboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages of Baptiste Deschamps , would go down to St. Louis when we departed upstream , bearing all the various trophies of the expedition to this point back to President Jefferson . In all this accelerated labor , personal affairs languished ; we were eager to be off and sailing once more for the Columbia country with the advent of spring . It was March loth , I think , when I first heard of Sacajawea 's illness . Knowing Clark had been visiting her the past day or so , I confronted him immediately . I assumed his calls had been in his capacity of company physician , and so demanded to know the worst . Unhappily , he was prepared to give it to me . " I will tell you something , Frank , " he answered bluntly . " If we can not determine what ails that girl , she 's going to die . I halfways think , for that matter , that she wants to . " " To die ? " I cried . " But why , in God 's name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do with her getting left behind when we go . Listen , boy , she seems to have a particular attachment for you , maybe you could get her to tell us what 's wrong . " " I would try it , Patron , " I agreed , frowning . " But if she wo n't talk to you , who we know she ? " " Bother that nonsense ! " he snapped . " Damn it , Frank , we 're faced with keeping a fine young girl from ( lying ! " " Yes , sir , " I submitted , coloring . " I 'll try , Captain . " " Good boy ! " he said , thumping my shoulder bruisingly . " Now be off with you and make her talk . We have n't much time and neither has she . " I left him and went down to the lodge of Charbonneau and called out to know if Frank Rivet might enter . At once the wondrous voice , grown distressfully weak , answered that " Brother Frank " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of she who lived within it . I nearly wept . But , controlling myself , I entered . I would have thought myself prepared for anything , but I was not .  | Sacajawea , that child of beauty and desire , lay haggard and hollow-eyed . She looked old and ugly . There was , too , in the close confines of that cowhide lodge , the unmistakable air of morbid disease and of death not far off . " What is this , Sister ? " I asked , forcing myself to smile . " Do you pine away here because the captains will leave you behind ? Because now you will not see your brother who is the young chief . What was his name , now ? ? " She looked away from me . I saw the shine of the tears . " Cameahwait , " she answered softly . " His name is Cameahwait . " " Oh , yes , Cameahwait , " I said , though I had never heard the name before . " And you did say he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get her mind at ease , but she replied with quick , low-voiced pride . " He is now the first chief , " she said . " Since I have been ill , Wahiki has heard secretly from the Assiniboin that the old chief is dead  --  Kooskiah is dead  --  and that Cameahwait has been named Grand Chief of the Shoshone in his place . But you must say nothing , Brother Frank . I have pledged Wahiki , also . I would not want Cameahwait to hear of my shame , to know his lost little sister had been left behind by the white captains . " I sank to her side , taking her thin hand in mine . " Sacajawea , " I pleaded , " is there no way that I may help you ? Take a message to Cameahwait , anything ? " She shook her head , and I saw the new tears roll . " If I can not go with the Red Head Chief and with you , Brother Frank , I would rather die . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live for his sake . You must do it , you must live . Please ! " " I will live , " she murmured , " when you have come back and told me that Captain Clark will take me with him . " It was hopeless , but I nodded as if it were not . " And if I promise to go see him this moment , will you begin to smile and to fight for your life ? " " I will , " she sighed , " when you return with his word . " could force no more from her . True Indian , having stated her position , she would not alter it , nor repeat it , nor defend it . I stood up at last to go . In my heart I realized I would not have  | the courage to return with Clark 's denial . When I moved to the entrance flaps , pausing for the final backward glance , I knew that I would not see her again . " Good-bye , Sacajawea , " I whispered . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow was no colder than the fear which clutched my heart . At the fort , and only to be true to her commissioning of me as her coureur d'amour , I sought out Captain Clark . Spying York on post outside the door of Captain Lewis 's quarters , I asked after his master and was told a conference of great urgency went forward within at this instant . " Concerning what ? " I said quickly . " The big ice start to break , " said York . " The whole damn river she begin to flow pretty quick . " I could hear the river ice grinding . If not yet truly open , the Missouri had commenced to loosen  --  the sign we had all been awaiting . " Who all is inside ? " I demanded . " Cap'n Lewis , Cap'n Clark , old Charbonneau , Big Bat Deschamps , all three sergeants . They even got Shahaka in there . Hell , everybody . Big meeting , Mister Frank . " " Any notion what it 's about , other than the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't yet figger no way for to make sure they get horses for the portage over the Rig Rock Mountains . That 's the main thing they 're cracking about . How abouten them packhorses ? " " Damn ! " I said . " I thought it was a granted fact we would get the horses from the Shoshone  --  that they had all the horses there were , or are , out there in that country . " " Sure , sure , but that ai n't the problem , Cap'n Clark say . It ai n't just finding them Injuns , it 's separating them from them horses . We cai n't move less'n we figgers some way to talk them Injuns inter helping us . " I knew that . Men could not move our heavy goods over the high passes . For that , only horses would do . Scowlingly , I started past him . " Well , " I said , " I 've no help for that . All I can add to their gloom is my own bit of bad news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said York , dark face clouding . " Is she sure ( ' Hough agoing to die , Mister Frank ? Pore little thing . " " Slir will die , " I said grimly , " unless I can get Captain I.cwis to Ict her go along with us . " York shook his head . " It ai n't only him , " he said . " Cap'n ( ; lark do n't want her going along neither . " " I realize that , God knows , " I muttered bitterly . " Too bad , " said York , " that Sacajawear ai n't the Injun the captains is looking for . You know , the one to go along and talk them Snakes out'n their horses . But we 's got to get us some big chief what draws abouten eight feet of water with them Shoshone for that job . Ai n't agoing to do us no damn good dragging out some pore little old sick squaw gal what they ai n't seen for five years and who was n't nobody in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Frank ? " Of a sudden the great light broke . Intelligence flooded the dark corners of my French-Pawnee brain . " My God , York , " I yelled , " if you were n't so ugly , I would kiss you ! Here , hell , I 'll kiss you anyway . " " I did so , too , and then shouted , " God bless you , black genie . Stand aside ! " Within the surprised council room , I was received with all the respect and accommodation of an idiot . Captain Lewis ordered me thrown out and it was only Clark 's intercession which spared me long enough to speak . " Patron , " I gasped to the latter , " may I please ask of Shahaka and Charbonneau one single Indian question ? " " Go ahead , " said Clark . " Be brief , Frank . We 're in serious business here . " " And I , Captain ! " I cried . " Listen to this . " I wheeled upon the Mandan and the French squawman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me at once , and without second thoughts , who is the Grand Chief of all the Shoshones ? " Shahaka and Charbonneau stared at me with near-equal degrees of compassion . It was the Mandan , because he liked me , who answered for both . " 1 t was until very recently the old chief , Kooskiah , " he said . " But he has just died this past moon , the Assiniboin say . The  | new Grand Chief is a very young man . His name is Cameahwait . We do not know him . " " Aha ! " I shouted . " You do not know him and neither does Charbonneau , or any man , red or white , in this room or in the Mandan villages . Am I correct ? Do you deny it ? " " Are you preparing to tell us , Rivet , " interrupted Lewis sharply , " that you do know this new Shoshone Grand Chief ? " " No , sir , " I returned boldly . " But I am prepared to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I know his sister . " Lewis 's face froze . " His sister ? " he said icily . " This better be no joke , Rivet . Your age wo n't save you again . " " I 'm not here to save myself , Captain , " I answered him defiantly . " I 'm here to save you ; I 've brought you your Shoshone horses , sir . " Clark , who had been watching intently , now moved in . " Out with it , Frank , " he said severely . " You 've beat around the bush quite long enough . Speak up . " " Yes , sir , and thank God for the chance to do so , " I said , facing him and Lewis rashly . " It 's Charbonneau 's squaw , Patron , young Sacajawea ; she 's the one that 's Cameahwait 's sister . " The silence in that room was thunderous . No man there , American , French , or Mandan , but understood instantly the historic significance of the discovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Chief guiding our party into the land of her fierce and warlike people , the expedition 's crucial problem of portage from the headwaters of the Missouri , to those of the mighty Columbia River in the far side of the Big Rock Mountains , was as good as solved . Thanks to Sacajawea we would get those good Shoshone horses , and get them in friendship and gratitude for our returning the child so brutally stolen by the cruel Minnetarees , blood enemies of the Snake people . She was a better pawn than any big chief ; a bigger bargain than ten Cliarbonneaus . She was , in effect , our passport into the land of the Shoshone . Clark simply took my hand , rugged face bright with pride . " Frank , " he said , " by damn , boy , you 're my Pawnee ! "
