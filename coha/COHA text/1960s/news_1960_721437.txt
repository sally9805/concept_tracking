txt An American Airlines Electra plane overturned and burned yesterday in landing at La . Guardia Airport . All seventy-six persons aboard scrambled to safety in what one after another called " a miracle . " A supervisory pilot had taken over the controls after making a semi-annual check of the proficiency of the first officer and flight engineer . He said the turboprop airliner had been caught in a " downdraft " current of air and its wheels had struck a dike rimming the Queens field . The dike is eight feet above mean tide level at Flushing Bay . The forty-five-ton , fourengined airliner plunged to the runway . Its left wing sheared off . Then it turned upside down and completely around . Finally it stopped on grass 1,500 feet away from the dike and burst into flame . The survival of those aboard was credited to fastened safety belts , which held the occupants in their seats ; to two stewardesses who got the emergency door open in the rear , and to two Trans World Airlines mechanics who raced over from 300 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinguisher on it . The pilot , Capt . Sheldon E. Pangburn , 47 years old , said he and the three other crew members in the cockpit " owe our lives to a passenger . " The cockpit doors and windows had jammed , but Alvin C. Hirshberg ; a Naval Reserve flier , saw the trapped men after he had got out himself . He used a 25-cent coin ' to help free a latch and slide back a window from the outside . Captain Pangburn declined comment on whether the temporary shortening of the southeast-northwest runway from 6,000 feet to 4,900 feet represented any contributing element in the crash . The runway has been shorter since March while $65,000,000 reconstruction work . proceeds . An American Airline spokes ; man said pilots now tried to I clear the dike by twenty to fifty feet , or fifteen to twenty feet less than when they had the longer runway ahead in landing . Captain Pangburn said , " Normally we try to clear the dike by ten feet or more , " depending on conditions . Clear Visibility Flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston at 8 A. M. en route to New York and St. Louis , started approaching for its 9 A. M. landing . The sky was blue and clear ; the Weather Bureau at La Guardia said the visibility was fifteen miles . The temperature was 57 degrees . The wind was west northwest at twenty knots . Capt . Gordon Staples of Rye , Beach , N. H. , the regular pilot , had shifted into the jump seat to let Captain Pangburn , the flight supervisor , make the landing . Captain Pangburn of Melrose , Mass , , has 15,000 hours of flying time , including 500 hours on Electras , and has been an American Airlines pilot since November , 1941 . First Officer Herbert Schleicher of Cochituate , Mass. , counted off the altitude and the air speed as the Electra swung down to 500 feet above sea level . The plane was coming in on Runway 31-13 , the only runway now being used for La Guardia 's 850 daily flights , since Runway 4-22 is undergoing reconstruction and Runway 9-27 , was abandoned three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was down to 120 knots at the time of the accident , Captain Pangburn reported later . He went on : " Immediately prior to reaching the boundary of the airport , in my opinion , we encountered possibly a gusty wind condition , resulting in some sinking of the airplane  --  that is , a higher sink rate , sometimes called a downdraft . " I had insufficient time to apply power to go around again . My left wing dropped momentarily , and I endeavored to bring the left wing up with aileron lateral control . " We felt a dull thud as the main landing gear struck the top of the dike . The left wing struck the ground and came off , and the airplane slid off the runway to the left and turned over on its back , and reversed its direction . " The dike is a grassy earthen seawall . As the airliner hit it , the left wheel due in deeper than the right . Ahead was a dirt road and then the runway 150 feet away . Pieces of the aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the ship made a sharp leftward turn , skidding and burning until it stopped . The sheared-off left wing wound up almost alongside the right wing , and flames boiled up on the right . Inside the plane , everyone later agreed , there was amazing calm . Stewardesses Margaret Flemng , 24 , of Wimbledon , England , and Donna Gilligan , 23 , of Park Forest , Ill. , both now Boston roommates , released their- safety belts in the lounge at the rear of the plane . Miss Fleming said she fell about eight feet  --  to the ceiling that had become the floor . Miss Gilligan said she " sort of crawled down the side of the plane . " The emergency exit in the lounge had been dislodged slightly ; they pushed it open . Perhaps forty passengers got out that doorway , the stewardesses said . It was only a short jump  --  less than three feet  --  to the marshy ground . Mechanics Race Out One hundred yards away , two T. W. A. mechanics , John L. Ryan , 39 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jack Harrington , 27 , of 2626 Bailey Avenue , the Bronx , were working on a parked plane . They jumped into a tractor and roared up to the plane . Mr. Ryan said he shot a carbondioxide lire extinguisher on the main cabin door and put out flames there . Mr. Harrington pushed in the door , and " a couple of women jumped into my arms , " he said later . After the passengers had rushed out , both mechanics went into the smoke-filled plane thirty feet vainly looking for more . Mr. Hirshberg , president of a cotton goods company in Haverhill , Mass. , had got out when he saw the crewmen trapped in the cockpit . Flight Engineer Kenneth Thoman of Danvers , Mass. , banged on the window and pointed to the outside cockpit release . " I took a quarter out of my pocket , " Mr. Hirshberg said , " and pried open the latch . The window was smashed , but it slid back , and the first one out was the flight engineer . He ran around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers were taken to Flushing Hospital . Two re- mained for treatment of minor burns of the hands and legs . They were Paul Sriberg , 35 years old , president of the Jay Steel Corporation , steel fabricators in Boston , and Irving Eison , 33 , a Boston advertising man . Both are neighbors in Needham , Mass . Four passengers were released from the hospital after treatment for bruises and shock .
