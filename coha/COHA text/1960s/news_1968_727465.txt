txt A Yemeni Arab , now a naturalized United States citizen , and two of his sons were held in $100,000 bail each yesterday in Brooklyn Criminal Court on charges of conspiracy to assassinate President-elect Richard M. Nixon .

On their behalf , Elliott Case , a Legal Aid Society lawyer , said none of the three had been in trouble here before . Investigators were checking whether the men might have ' had any association with Sirhan B. Sirhan , the Jordanian await-1 ing trial for the Los Angeles ' i assassination of Senator Robert ' F. Kennedy . Ambassador Urges Caution In Washington , the Secret Service said last night that any attempt to link the plot with Senator Kennedy 's assassination was " pure speculation at the moment . " Mohsin Alaini , Yemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his consulate had no record of the three men arrested here . Ambassador Alaini urged caution in prejudging the case . He suggested that vmeone with a quarrel might have accused the men and then arms might have been found in their apartment . " In Yemen , everyone has arms , " he said . " For President Nixon , I // know our reaction to him is in his favor . and this is a feeling that most of the Arabs have , they have nothing against him , " Ambassador Alaini said . " Some people say- he said something during the campaign . In United States policies , a campaign is a campaign , and they have to say something against the opponent . " The three defendants are Ahmed Natter. 43 years old , and his sons . Hussein , 20. and Abdo , 16 , all of 496 Hinsdale Street in Brooklyn 's East New York section . Mr. Case told Judge T.

About 60 persons were in ' the courtroom when the three , men were taken in shortly after , noon .

Koota resigned last Sept. 9 to run for Supreme Court justice  --  said he intended to present evidence to the grand jury tomorrow morning .

There was no indication at that point of any connection with the arrest of Edward Hotter , a 30-year-old Egyptian , five blocks from Mr. Nixon 's apartment here on a charge of possessing a loaded rifle and a switchblade knife . Ambassador Alaini said in a telephone interview last night that there were perhaps 5,000 or more Yemeni in the United States , both those of American citizenship and those still aliens . " Personally , I do not think these people would have any connection with such plots , Ambassador Alaini said . " I know Yemenis in Brooklyn . " I do not think they are nationalists to that point , to do something for political reasons . The Republican regime has been there since six years ago . I know there are some still think of the Imam royalist era . " So what I think is maybe someone who has differences with these people did call and accuse them of something . The other thing is that in Yemen everyone has arms . It is permitted . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to check . " Dr. M. T.

You ' ca n't be concerned about it levery time something like this ' happens . " During the campaign , the ' Nixon campaign committee pub- , lished a bore . " Nixon on The ' Issues .
