Broadway is so commercially minded , goes one prevailing myth , that it will not permit a playwright the creative right to fail . To judge by its seasonal multimillion-dollar losses , Broadway is about as uncommercial an enterprise as can be imagined , and the right to fail is honored more often than not . Ever since the success of Virginia Woolf in 1962 , Edward Albee has exercised this right annually . Tiny Alice , The Ballad of the Sad Caf , A Delicate Balance , Malcolm , Everything in the Garden , and now Box and Quotations from Mao Tse-tung represent the alarming deterioration of a formidable talent . <P> Albee 's characters have never been quite believable , but he used to have a fine knack for making their hostilities waspishly real . His weakness has been an inability to spin a plot , which is why he has adapted and borrowed so much . In Box-Mao he tries to make a virtue out of that weakness by eliminating any narrative whatsoever . The resulting story vacuum masquerades as an experiment in abstraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at all onstage . The set is simply the metal framework of a box the size of a room . On a garbled tape recording , the voice of Ruth White-middle-aged , pensive , measured and monotonous-fills the box and the theater . The voice is almost sleep inducing , like water lapping persistently at a sea wall . Actress White 's monologue consists of some pretentious restatements of the obvious : Art is order ; craftsmanship is waning ; children in far-off places are starving to death . <P> After this , the box is supplied with a raised platform so that it seems like the sun deck of an ocean liner . On it sit and stand four characters . One is Chairman Mao Tse-tung ( Wyman Pendleton ) , who mouths Marxist-Leninist platitudes about the irreparable decline of the imperialist West . Another character is a decayed society drone ( Nancy Kelly ) who recalls her frustrated attempt at suicide together with such intimate details of her sex life as the smooth tautness of her husband 's scrotum . Another woman ( Sudie Bond ) recites the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Poor house . The fourth character , a man with a pipe , lies silently in a deck chair , exhibiting what can only be called amazing restraint . <P> While each of the monologists is interrupted with a certain metronomic regularity , there is no visible thematic link between the speeches , though a mood of melancholy and decay permeates the evening . Each speaker seems to be addressing himself , a form of alienation that succeeds wonderfully in alienating the audience . It may be that Albee had in mind Walter Pater 's dictum that " all art constantly aspires towards the condition of music . " The kind of music one gets in Box-Mao is the dead space between notes .
