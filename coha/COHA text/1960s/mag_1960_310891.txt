" In a world that 's so troubled and so insecure , " says a vice president of a music publishing firm trying to make it sound psychologically profound , " teenagers find that the only thing that 's eternal and everlasting is love after death . " Since that 's what the young are supposed to want , that 's what they are getting . The more violent the death , the more violent the passion pouring from the nation 's jukeboxes . Keens one kid on Teen Angel , an M-G-M release : <P> Teen angel , can you hear me ? Teen angel , can you see me ? Are you somewhere up above , And am I still your own true love ? <P> Teen angel , it develops , went to heaven when she left the side of her steady date , ran back to his stalled car to retrieve his high-school ring , and was flattened by a train . Another current song records the fate of a red Indian named Running Bear ( Mercury ) who leaps into angry rapids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , from the opposite bank of the river , and they drown happily into the hereafter . But nothing in the 1960 morbid-ditty collection can touch Tell Laura I Love Her ( RCA Victor ) , a best-selling ballad set in the flaming wreckage of a stock car . Tommy , the dying driver , has entered the race to win money to buy a wedding ring ; he gasps out the hit tune with his dying breath and departs for heaven . <P> Funereal Chimes . Trapped in soda fountains or chrome-aluminum roadside diners and forced to listen to such uplift , elders may blink in dismay . Pop songs are now , more than ever before , tailored to the adolescents who buy them . But the gloom boom is not new . <P> There was , for example , The Lady in Crepe , a woman whose husband , according to the ballad popular in the 18905. had drowned in Long Island Sound . The mourning widow subsequently went fishing there . <P> Her line grew heavy as lead , When up rose a creature whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me in the deep blue sea . " And he gave such a tug on the line That he dragged her down in her seagreen gown . While she sang " Forever Thine . " <P> Even more touching was the situation of the poor man in In the Baggage Coach Ahead ( 1896 ) , who sat in a train trying to hush his crying baby . The child 's face reminded him of his late wife , making the trip in a coffin elsewhere on the train . <P> Telephones had barely become popular before a little girl was on the line , in a popular song , singing : " Hello , Central , give me Heaven . " She wanted to talk to her mother . And never did the eternal triangle chime more funereally than it did in the Nineties , most notably under the hand of Paul Dresser , songwriter ( The Banks of the Wabash ) , monologuist , medicine-wagon minstrel and older brother of Theodore Dreiser . Dresser 's He Brought Home Another might have qualified as the first great aria in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion on the hill , Kind hands were laying Nellie To rest , behind the mill . <P> In the 30s , came Gloomy Sunday . " In death I 'm caressing you , " mourned a lonely lover , " with the last breath of my soul I 'll be blessing you . " Song pluggers boasted that the ditty gave a big boost to suicide rates all over the world , particularly along the blue Danube , where students were said to have jumped in in droves.
