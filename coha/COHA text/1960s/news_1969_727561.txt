txt The first three men to see the far side of the moon were given a roaring welcome to the city yesterday by earthbound multitudes still trying to comprehend the fullness of the incredible voyage . It was a bleak day , with a noontime temperature of 28 degrees . The blizzard of con-. fetti and paper that . greeted the astronauts in the traditional ticker-tape parade up lower Broadway was whipped by gusts that raced through the downtown canyons at 27 miles an hour . Braving the numbing cold , hundreds and thousands jammed Broadway sidewalks from Bowling Green to City Hall and cheered the bareheaded astronauts who sat shivering on the top of the back seat of an open car . Wave Gloved Hands The men who had looked down from their space ship on the craters of the moon waved gloved hands at the shouting crowds . " My gosh , look at all the people , " said Col. Frank Borman , commander of the momentous flight , with a touch of the wonderment he had . voiced in his description of the lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force colonel were Capt . James A. Lovell Jr . of the Navy and Lieut . Col. William A. Anders of the Air Force . " It 's overwhelming , " replied Colonel Anders . " You know they 're you friends when they come to see you in this weather . " Orange and black signs reading " Apollo Way " had replaced Broadway street signs for the day , and in City Hall Park , cold and only half filled when the motorcade arrived , the wind snapped at the pennants on a lofty triumphal arch fashioned from the ladders of firetrucks . Receive City Medal On an open platform in front of the City Hall steps , Mayor Lindsay presented the city 's highest award , the Gold Medal " of the City of New York , to the space travelers . For 12 hours of a crowded schedule the three explorers and their families were deluged with adulation . The Mayor gave them a lunch at the New York State Theater . Governor Rockefeller was their host at a state dinner in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Thant , who expressed the wistful hope that some of the delegates to the United Nations could view the world with the humbling perspective gained by the astronauts in their travels around the moon . He called them " the first true universalistr and indulged this whimsy : " The legendary cow of the nursery rhyme never did make it , but these three men actually did jump over the moon . " We Are All Bmthers ' Colonel Borman replied : " We saw the earth the size of a quarter . And we recognized then , mod we reported then , that there really is one world= we are all brothers . " The colonel spoke humbly , but for the crowds that . had - massed - along lower Broadway it was a day of surging national pride . Many carried flags . Some sang along when Jan Peerce , burying his hands deep ' in his overcoat pockets against the ? cold ; ? sang the National ' Anthem to open the ceremonies at City Hall . Mayor Lindsay tried to express the prevailing emotion . He remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States a badly needed ' lift . Saying that the - men had brought renewed glory . to the nation ; the Mayor added : " They have given a fresh and glowing luster- to the adventurous pioneering spirit of this country . They have accomplished with grace and courage what no ? men have done before . They have achieved the impossible , conquered the unknown . Free People Can Prevail ' . " But most of all , they have ' shown the world what this country is made of . . . what it can do , .. and how the spirit of a free people can prevail over the greatest challenges to our . destiny as a nation . " A few , minutes earlier , at a reception , - in his office , the Mayor had eavesdropped on the astronauts ' conversation and heard them say : " It 's a forbidding place . . . gray and colorless . ? . It shows the scars of a terrific bombardment .. . certainly not a very inviting place to live or work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were talking about New York . " So I broke in , " he told the crowd in City Hall Plaza , " and said , If you 're going to talk like that you 're not going to get your gold medals ' . " The astronauts ' triumphal day in the city began . at 10:55 A.M. when their Air Force twin-engine Convair touched down . at La Guardia Airport . Only 75 welcomers awaited them at the Marine Air Terminal . The wind nagged at the kilts of the bagpipe band of the Emerald Society of the Police Department and reddened the knees of the pipers . Borman Greets Spectators Smiling , Colonel Borman walked over to the fence and shook hands with the shivering spectators . He was officially greeted by Francis X. Smith , the new President of the City Council , and by Gen. Courtland V. R. Schuyler , the State Commissioner of General Services , who was representing Governor Rockefeller . Small groups of pedestrians lined the motorcade route over the Triborough Bridge : and down the East River Drive . At Bowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open car . Mayor Lindsay , wearing a Russianstyle fur hat , and Governor Rockefeller took the jump seats in front of the space travelers . Promptly at noon the procession started the mile-long journey to City Hall , and the Broadway canyon rang with cheers and martial music . Windows in the skyscrapers were dense with people . There seemed to be less confetti and paper than usual , perhaps due to fact that no one really wanted to open a window . And for the first time there was a downfall of the new-fangled computer tape . Wind Catches Streamers The wind caught 100-footlong streamers of paper and snagged them in the trees of Bowling Green and City Hall Park . ' I wish I 'd bought my space suit , " said Colonel Anders , his teeth chattering . Captain Lovell threw a salute at two street cleaners who : were shaking their brooms jokingly at the astronauts in a mock gesture of rage . " We feel sorry for you , " Captain Lovell shouted to the men who would have to help clean up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanitation Department spokesman said the storm of paper had been inhibited by the cold weather , the Hong Kong flu and Mildews in air-conditioned office buildings that are permanently closed . Only 200 tons poured down , he said , compared with the 2,850 tons , a record , that greeted , Gen. Douglas A. on April 20 , 1951 . Still , it was a colorful spectacle . The crowds , despite their chill , were , good-natured and there was a minimum of heckling signs directed against the Mayor and the Governor , some of which suggested that they be sent immediately to the moon . At the City Hall ceremony , Colonel Anders and Captain Lovell said nothing as the Mayor hung medals around their necks . The frozen crowd managed a thin cheer . Then Colonel Borman , acting as spokesman for the three , stepped forward and said : " We aft love New York  --  and we all-love you . " Before the , medals were presented , Governor Rockefeller , hailed the astronauts as " wonIderful men who gave the world a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then the acting head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , Dr. Thomas 0 . Paine , described the lunar voyage as " a message of great hope for the nation : " Dream No Small Dreams ' " We should dream no small - dreams , ' he said . " We should undertake those enterprises which lift the soul . " City politicians milled about , and a contretemps developed when City Council President Smith refused to sit in his third-row seat . He was assigned there because , according to a City Hall spokesman for protocol , he was not named Council President in a citywide-election . Miffed , Mr. Smith stood at the back of the speakers ' platform during the ceremonies . En route to Lincoln Center for the Mayor 's lunch in the lobby of the New York State Theater , the astronauts paused briefly in front of Police Headquarters . An honor guard was lined up on Centre Street , and the grimy facade of headquarters bore a green and white sign : " Well Done Astronauts . " On l 4th Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were greeted by a Salvation Army hand and a hand-carried sign that urged : " Go Higher . " At the Mayor 's lunch , Archbishop Terence J. Cooke gave the invocation for 550 guests representing a cross section of the city 's political , social and religious life . The guests were a gregarious lot. , perhaps overly relaxed , mid at one time John S. ( Bud ) Palmer , the city 's official greeter , hag In reprimand them for theristing menus and bits of STREETS ON PARADE Rouyn had new names for the day paper at the astronauts as they tried to eat . During the raspberry ice and petits fours , Mr. Palmer went to the podium and scolded : " I ' know everybody has a high regard for our guests of honor , but if we keep on press-1 ing toward the head table , I 'm afraid we 'll have to abruptly : terminate this . " He said the autograph seekers presented a - " serious security problem " by blocking off the plainclothesmen assigned to guard the astronauts and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tea for Two , " there was an unseemly clatter . From a gallery fell a five-pound telescopic lens that had been loosened accidentally from a newsman 's camera . It fell , in the middle of a table , smashing a glass and sprinkling ' half a dozen diners with wine . The astronauts were several tables removed and paid no heed . Each table had as its centerpiece a plastic model of the moon . ' At the head table , where the astronauts and their wives sat with the Mayor and Mrs. Lindsay , a tiny spaceship revolved around the centerpiece , but it was going the wrong way , counter-clockwise . The astronauts ' lunar orbits Iliad been clockwise . " This could only happen in New York , " the Mayor quipped . The Mayor said the circling of the moon had " reaffirmed that the United States was still a land of explorers , " and he expressed the hope that future astronauts would confer mineral rights on the moon to New York City in order to balance the budget . Archbishop Cooke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiced in their broadcasts from space . " Heavenly Father , whose almighty hand , fashioned the universe , " the Archbishop prayed , " be with us today as we of New York City open wide our hearts to welcome three gallant heroes . " He expressed the hope that the exploration of space would be " a great step for peace . " In the evening at the Waldorf hundreds of people crowded their way through the tightly packed aisles of dinner tables to ask the astronauts to autograph their programs and souvenir photographs of the moon and the earth taken from the Apollo 8 spacecraft . The crush continued for 40 minutes , as women 's gowns were torn , men 's ties were knocked askew and people stepped on one another 's toes . Colonel Borman , introduced by the Mayor as a " distinguished and decent guy , " announced that he had made his last space flight and - would become deputy director of flight operations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . At the conclusion of the luncheon , Pearl Bailey sang " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered " It 's Only a Paper Moon , " but she told Colonel Anders that the lunar orbit had " thrown that song out the window . " A 70-second standing ovation greeted the astronauts in the chamber of the United Nations Security Council . " We proudly and warmly welcome to the U.N . today three exceptionally brave and adventurous men , " Secretary General Thant said in a welcoming address .
