( See Cover ) For seven generations , one European family has dominated an incredible part of all that money can buy . Its escutcheon-a profusion of noble coronets , intrepid lions and soaring eagles-is carved in stone amidst the proudest vineyards of Bordeaux . On the Continent 's most prized race horses , its blue and yellow colors proclaim a devotion to the sport of kings that has produced profit as well as pleasure . From its London and Paris banks , the family 's millions have been sent forth to back more than 100 business enterprises on six continents . Some of its stately dwellings are the kind of mansions that mere San Simeons hoped to imitate , and the family moves comfortably through international society and top-level business circles . This ancient and unusual banking dynasty shields itself from the curious eye of the public , but the map and history of Europe have been changed by its action and etched with its name : the House of Rothschild . <P> Rothschild gold has powered the ambitions of prime ministers , princes and popes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of politics and bailed out armies and na tions . The Rothschilds strung railroads across the Continent , gained control of the Suez Canal for Britain , supported oilfields in the Caucasus and the Sahara , carved diamond mines in the African veld . Seldom unimaginative in the use of their money , they paid for the expedition that exhumed the mummy of Egypt 's long-lost King Tutankhamen , have supported countless hungering artists and endowed many hospitals . To be a Rothschild has usually meant the possession not only of money but of the ability to enjoy it fully ; this has resulted in a family trait of diversity . From the fruitful Rothschild family tree , heavy with shrewd financiers , have come half a hundred outstanding legislators , scientists , sportsmen and war heroes-as well as a few playboys . But as many Rothschilds have lived out lives of luxurious ordinariness ; the family shrewdness and sophistication has not been evenly distributed . <P> No modern family-neither the Krupps nor the Philipses nor the Thyssens-has been so important for so long in European business . Newer dynasties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions , but modern standards of wealth do not really measure the Rothschilds . The fortune of the family 's financiers totals anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion , but ledgers can not reflect the Rothschild lands , their possessions and influence accumulated over the generations , their priceless collections of art . Though the Rothschilds ' fortune has been subdivided more than 100 times over the years , it still seems inexhaustible . The family stands as elegant proof that to be truly rich in Europe is to be richer than anywhere else .
