While former Chancellor Ludwig Erhard is known as the architect of the postwar economic recovery that West Germans refer to as the Wirtschaftswunder , a slight , self-assured man named Heinz Nordhoff is certainly one of the nation 's master builders . Because he had run wartime Germany 's biggest military truck plant , U.S. occupation authorities restricted him to manual labor . The more pragmatic British tapped him to revive a Wolfsburg auto factory which had been so badly bombed that , Nordhoff was later to recall , it " did n't even smell good enough for the Russians . " That plant had once built Volkswagens , and Nordhoff 's success in getting it back into gear has become a legend ( TIME cover , Feb. 15 , 1954 ) . By last week , when he announced that he would retire as board chairman , Wolfsburg had become horns base for West Germany 's biggest industry . Volkswagen ranks fourth behind only the U.S. Big Three among the world 's automakers . <P> <P> Less than Perfect . Nordhoff is leaving Volkswagen because he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , when " it is not only customary but even a compelling need to think in time about one 's successor . " The years , unfortunately , have overtaken him at a moment when Volkswagen-like the Wirtschaftswunder itself-is performing at less than capacity . <P> West Germany is in a serious recession , and consumers are sitting on their pocketbooks . Volkswagen domestic production has dropped 25% from 1966 's record high of 1,476,000 vehicles . Like U.S. automakers , the company has been hit by the safety scare . In the mini-motor field , which its beetles long dominated , VW is getting serious competition from General Motors ' Opel and the German Ford . Nordhoff has been fighting the pinch with stepped-up exports and a new , cheaper ( $1,121 ) 41 h.p . Model 1200 that he christened Wirt-schaftskrise Kafer , or " economic crisis beetle . " With all that , his successor , Kurt Lotz , 54 , will have plenty of problems . <P> Clerk to Chairman . Lotz was chosen because he seemed equal to all those problems-and more . Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to assessing war needs . " That was my first strong contact with industrial planning , " he says . At war 's end he took a clerk 's job in Mannheim with the German subsidiary of the Swiss firm of Brown , Boveri &; Cie , which makes all kinds of electrical equipment from home appliances to locomotives . Within twelve years , Lotz rose to chairman . He and the Swiss fell out over a small computer company in which he had invested to compete with U.S. computer makers , only to have it lose money . Lotz , as a result , decided to go job hunting . Volkswagen 's directors offered him the $250,000-a-year post as Nordhoff 's successor . <P> <P> Because tall , athletically built Kurt Lotz is long on organization and diplomacy but short on knowledge of automaking , he will work in Nordhoff 's shadow for almost two years , learning the complexities of the worldwide company . Nordhoff is not scheduled to step aside until the end of 1968.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
