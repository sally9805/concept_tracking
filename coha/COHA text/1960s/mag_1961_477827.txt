The first radical development in twenty years is now making Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie look almost as dated as Haydn . ( With a selective list of the key records by the new musical pioneers . ) AS THINGS go in jazz , twenty years is a long time . And for almost twenty years jazz has been dominated by the musical language introduced by the saxophonist Charlie ( " Bird " ) Parker and the trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie . This music was rather unfortunately called " be bop " when it first found a following and it came ? more fortunately ? to be known as " modern jazz . " Not too long ago the music of Gillespie and Parker often produced shock and outrage ? even to some avid followers of jazz ? but today popularized versions of it are commonplace . Almost every Sunday the featured comedian on the Ed Sullivan show runs off the stage to a little melody that is really a simplified version of an old Gillespie piece . And one TV comedy series uses a saxophone theme that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now a different kind of jazz is emerging and one again its striking and radical departures from the jazz that went before it are producing outraged protest in some parts of the jazz world . For lack of a better name , some call this music " the new thing " : others jokingly label it " space music " ; with some accuracy it has been called " atonal jazz . " Whatever it is called , practically everyone agrees that one of the leading figures involved is the saxophonist Ornette Coleman . Two years ago the composer and pianist John Lewis put down a reaction to Coleman 's music which still describes some of the excitement of what is happening today : " There are , " Lewis wrote , " two young people I met in California ? an alto player named Ornette Coleman and a trumpet player named Don Cherry . I 've never heard anything like then be-fore . Ornette is the driving force of the two .... They play together like I 've never heard anybody play together . It 's not like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't figure out what it 's all about yet . Ornette is , in a sense , an extension of Charlie Parker and the first I 've heard . This is the real need ... to extend the ideas ol Bird until they are not playing an imitation but actually something new . I think that they may have come up with something , not perfect yet , and still in the early stages , but nevertheless very fresh and interesting . " To understand how the new music came about , we should forget earlier theories of jazz history which saw the music of the ' twenties and ' thirties geographically ? as " New Orleans Style , - " Chicago Style , " " New York Style , " " Kansas City Style , " etc . It should be clear by now that from the late ' twenties through the early ' forties jazz was largely dominated by Louis Armstrong 's style . With great personal power and brilliance , Armstrong made major innovations in the musical language that jazzmen had to work with , and his ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruitful work by jazz soloists and composers alike . By the late ' thirties , one composer was providing , with his orchestra , a sort of brilliant and personal synthesis of all of those years of Armstrong 's dominance . That was Duke Ellington . Ellington 's best pieces ? Ko Ku , Harlem Air Shaft , Concerto for Cootie ( for trumpeter Cootie Williams ) , Sepia Panorama ? carry jazz beyond the improvising soloist or the series of striking episodes that a string of good solos can provide . He and his players offered orchestrations in which composer , group , and individual improviser all contribute to a whole with the total effect surpassing the sum of its parts . Today it seems more useful to see the history of jazz in a kind of Hegelian scheme : we can trace a pendulum swing from major innovation ( Armstrong in the ' twenties , Gillespie and Parker in the ' forties ) to synthesis and form ( Ellington ) . 70 " THE NEW THING " IN JAll Certainly such a view involves simplifications and a neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman Hawkins and Bix Beiderhecke in the ' twenties , Roy Eldridge and Lester Young in the ' thirties . But such a scheme does bring some kind of musical and aesthetic order into the relative chaos of jazz history and it certainly deals with its major styles and achievements more meaningfully than another of those tawdry trips up the Mississippi to Chicago , followed by a jaunt to New York in a Stutz Bearcat . One thing immediately emerges : changes in jazz are not the result of caprice , and dealing with this music as an art is no delusion . Jazz does indeed behave like an art and its history responds to such aesthetic categories . Folk and popular musics do not behave this way . To a Flamencan guitarist , the highest achievement is to play just as much like his great-grandfather as he can . In most American popular music , the constant changes are surface devices that lead nowhere musically . In jazz , major changes lead to years of musical exploration and development . The next question is obvious : Have the innovations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , but no dominant figure has appeared . We find order and form in the work of a small core of composers , players , and groups . One such group is the Modern Jazz Quartet . Its chief composer is pianist John Lewis , its chief soloist is vibraphonist Milt Jackson . but the group works together masterfully . It has been said that the MJQ engages in the kind of cocktail-lounge stunt work unworthy of a jazz group ? that it borrows classical devices wholesale and without assimilating them into the jazz idiom . And it is true that an evening 's concert by the Quartet may have its arid moments in which Milt Jackson 's wonderful talent is wasted on some mechanically academic effects . It is also true that the Quartet 's early fugue Vendome sounded suspiciously like in the style of Bach " quackery . John Lewis studied composition at the Manhattan School of Music and the effects of this training are sometimes less than happy . However , the Quartet 's later fugues ? Concord Martin Williams . who contributes regularly to " Metronome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record Guide , " was formerly co-editor of " The Jazz Review . " His anthology , " The Art of Jazz , " was published by Oxford and has been reissued in paperback by Evergreen ; and his radio show on . jazz is heard on the Heritage Network.and Versailles ? are real improvisational jazz fugues and remind us more of Jelly Roll Morton than the conservatory practice-room . And the best of the Quartet 's pieces are things like John Lewis ' Django and The Goldrn Striker ? relatively simple themes plus recurring motifs and structures which give continuity , group textures , and over-all form to the improvising . Django , for example , is a funeral piece for the French gypsy guitarist-turned-jazzman Django Reinhardt . It has a touching lyric theme , a recurring traditional blues motif ( as old as jazz anti echoing the exaltation of traditional New Orleans funeral music ) , plus an harmonic framework on which the Quartet 's gifted players improvise melodies . The Modern Jazz Quartet has been improvising on Django for over seven years and its members still find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has gradually changed the whole character of the piece , yet its compositional basis still endures . THE DOUR PIXIE of the most remarkable recent masters of form in jazz is iconoclastic pianist-composer Thelonious Monk . In 1941 , he was already making important contributions to the basic musical language of modern jazz . By the late ' forties he had become a major jazz composer . By the late ' fifties he was still soundly testing new ideas . but his work was also a kind of terse and passionate summary of all that had gone before him , echoing everyone from James P. Johnson through the younger Monk . The most immediately accessible Monk is the one who takes a popular ditty , reharmonizes it to make a real piano composition out of it , and builds it into sets of strikingly original variations ? often humorously and ingeniously rephrasing the theme itself throughout . The square can follow him , the aficionado is ( as he is apt to put it ) gassed . Just You , Just Me is a fine example of such a Monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drummer Art Blakey recognizably employs the theme in his chorus ) and the over-all design is praiseworthy . In such playing Monk has profited by fifty years of jazz , and gone back to an earlier style . Instead of inventing new melodies out of a framework of chords ? as have most jazz musicians since the mid-'thirties ? he prefers to do variations directly on a theme , reminiscent of the early styles of James P. Johnson and Jelly Roll Morton . But rather than merely embellish or decorate a melody , Monk is apt to reduce it , twist it , redesign it , fragment it to an outline of a few suggestive notes . The best comment I 've ever heard on Monk came from a comparative square who said , " Most of these people seem to have good ideas , but Monk seems to finish things , to get them all said . I feel satisfied and sort of full when one of his things is over . " Examples of Monk , the major composer , are pieces like Criss Cross , Off Minor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straight No Chaser , These arc not " tunes " but real **28;1709;TOOLONG ? the best clue being that , as with Beethoven , we do not go away wanting to whistle them ourselves , but wanting to hear them played again . In 1958 fame finally began to reach this quiet yet powerful man ? this " dour pixie , " as he has been called . But Monk had already been a major jazzman for fifteen years . At about the same time that Monk began to win the popularity polls , another sign of synthesis in modern jazz appeared . It came not from a composer or group but from tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins , an improvising horn man who was directly influenced by Monk 's ideas . Rollins ' Blue 7 is surely one of the most remarkable jazz improvisations ever recorded . It is eleven minutes long and it unfolds from beginning to end with a direction and order that a good composer might have taken days to achieve and an immediacy that he could never achieve . The piano choruses by Tommy Flanagan arc contrasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingeniously and Rollins uses it brilliantly . Roach commented , " Monk would say , ' Why do n't we use the theme ? Why do we throw it away and just run the chords ? ' We had that in mind when we made Blue 7 . " Rollins teases , elaborates , fills in , reduces , praises , and parodies that Blue 7 theme throughout , and hearing his variations is surely one of the great musical pleasures in jazz since Charlie Parker 's death . As I have said , some aspects of Monk 's work outline new developments . One of these is his very free and original use of jazz rhythms . Another is the fact that Monk will let the melody he is building determine its own direction as long as it is aesthetically logical . In this he often overrides a pre-set harmonic framework . Actually , Monk has pushed jazz to the brink of atonality . And in the past three years , several authentic players have appeared who improvise atonally almost as a matter of course . HYBRID OR FINISHED WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed an interesting alliance in the past few years . This is the so-called " third stream , " an effort to combine written classical forms and improvised jazz in single works . Of course , this is quite a different matter from the occasional and fairly superficial use of written " blue notes , " quasi-jazz rhythms , or jazzy effects by Milhaud . Ravel , Stravinsky , et a ! . The " third stream " piece involves a rather concerto grossolike structure combining both classical and jazz musicians on the same platform : the classical players serve as the orchestra and the jazzmen perform as the concerti . There have been some rather dismal failures in the idiom so far , and some out-and-out trash . ( Some of those failures and some of that trash , by the way , have been commissioned for and performed by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic . ) A decided success is Gunther Schuller 's piece , Conversations , written for a 1959 Town Hall concert by both the Beaux Arts String Quartet and the Modern Jazz Quartet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the piece to Schuller 's earlier work , Transformation . In Transformation , the classical orchestra players begin in their own idiom and gradually evolve into a jazz style , whereupon the jazzmen take over and improvise . Little by little , things are reversed and the jazzmen turn into classicists , whereupon the real classicists take over and reestablish their manner . Aside from the merely technical difficulty of getting classical musicians to swing , this alliance seems to be sentimental , with each music politely deferential to the other . Conversations works in precisely the opposite way . When the string quartet has built to a high pitch of tension , the jazzmen enter abruptly with strongly contrasting , relaxed , and fluent improvisation . And when the jazzmen have begun 72 " THE NEW THING " IN JAll to establish their own kind of tension , the strings re-enter behind , playing in contrapuntal argument . Throughout the piece , Schuller has let each music go its own way , maintain its own standards of emotion , melody , and rhythm . It is as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at things , and the basis of Conversations is the tension between the two idioms . Even the resolution is a kind of agreement to disagree . Perhaps most important , Schuller has used jazz in his piece for what it is with no apologies and has trusted his jazzmen to carry their part . Thereby he has produced , not an experiment or a hybrid , but a finished work . D iZZY Gillespie has said that he , Monk , and the others , used to work out difficult chord progressions deliberately , to confuse the amateurs and keep them out of the experimental jam sessions that led to he bop and modern jazz . A young musician said the other day , " We keep changing the tempo and the key and leaving out the chords altogether when we play so those damned be hoppers wo n't try to sit in with us . " He did n't mean Gillespie or anyone like him , of course . But his statement is a reflection of the facts that very few of the youngest players in jazz are finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie Parker provided , and that many of the younger men who play that style play it in a derivative , mechanical , and conventional manner . Even the most searching and sincere players often seem so boxed in by the pre-set structures that they may appear to be running around like rats caught in an harmonic maze . There have been rumblings of a change for at least five years now . Bassist Charlie Mingussaw the coming deadlock , reached for atonality , and often shouted to his players to " stop copying Bird . " Another evidence was the fact that men were looking to Monk for guidance . A third came about when Miles Davis herded his men ? saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian ( " Cannonball " ) Adderley and pianist Bill Evans ? into a studio to make a record called Kind of Blue . Instead of improvising on the usual preset chord patterns , Davis required his men to make up their melodies from scales and modes which he assigned them on the spot , and let the harmonies fall where they may . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a young pianist named Paul Bley , another a pianist-composer named Cecil Taylor . Then in 1959 Ornette Coleman came to New York . Charlie Mingus employed a reed man named Eric Doi-pity . The composer George Russell formed a sextet . Even Jimmy Giuffre , decidedly from another generation , has been attracted to this new jazz and uses Bley in his trio . Today , musicians working on " the new thing " are turning up almost daily in New York , and the players who are already known rattle off the names of other and yet unknown players with ease . Sonic of those who have been heard are good , some are not , some are merely faking ? for free and atonal music may invite faking at this stage . At least one man is potentially a popularizer of the style . It seems undeniable that the things they are working on will dominate jazz for its next period . For a sympathetic listener , some of these men can create a whole new sensibility . One is the pianist Cecil Taylor , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the New England Conservatory . His playing clearly shows a knowledge of the classical composers of this century : Bartok , Stravinsky , Schonberg , etc . However , he is also aware of the jazz tradition and just as clearly displays familiarity with Ellington and Monk . But Taylor is a starkly emotional performer who does not like to talk about his work . He will say that he hopes his playing speaks for itself and , if pressed further , that he plays to give people pleasure . Ornette Coleman came to atonal jazz by a very different route from Taylor 's , and he deals with it very differently . A slight , soft-spoken , self-taught young man from Fort Worth , Coleman will talk about his music at length to anyone who is really interested , describing what he is doing modestly , candidly , in his own highly intuitive and sometimes cryptic way . Coleman heard the jazz of the ' thirties played around him when he was growing up and he absorbed the work of Parker and Gillespie from records . He studied harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began writing his own pieces clown in a personal style of notation that still gives other players some trouble . By the late ' forties , he was : playing a style that some are still attacking as out of tune and in total ignorance of harmony . One probably significant fact is that Coleman used his sister 's piano book for study . It was in C. whereas Coleman 's alto saxophone was , of course , in E flat . This happy accident may have set him on his path , but the point is that he heard tonal relationships as correct when only an avant-garde classicist would have agreed with him . He later worked out his ideas on tenor saxophone too . He hit on the same general direction that Schonberg did , but he did it in terms of jazz and with no influence from classicism ? and no academic snobbery about " improving jazz . " his idea as he puts it is , " once the technical basis is understood , to be as free as possible . Not to play the framework , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first jobs were with the small " rhythm and blues " groups that flourished throughout the South ? and still do ? the more honorable progenitors of the rock ' n ' roll style . Hostility to him ran high in most of the ensembles ? he was thrown out of one for " trying to make a be hopper " out of the other saxophonist in the group , and it got so that another leader was paying him not to play . Stranded in Los Angeles for the second time , still kept from playing at jam sessions by musicians who accused him of musical ignorance , he was nevertheless presented as a potential composer to a record producer named Lester Koenig , by the bassist Red Mitchell . But Coleman protested that he had no scores and he could n't play his music on the piano . Instead he began performing y cappella on his saxophone and then Koenig wanted Coleman as well as his pieces . Gradually things began to happen to him ? help from John Lewis , a contract with Atlantic Records in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Five Spot in New York 's lower East Side with his own quartet . Coleman was soon packing the house , attracting reporters ( some of them intrigued by the largely extrinsic fact that he plays an inexpensive white plastic alto sax ) , and pulling in the intelligentsia ? including a delighted Leonard Bernstein , an en-thralled Marc Blitzstein , an approving Virgil Thomson , and an unsettled Kenneth Tynan ( " They 've gone too fad " ) . COLEMAN AND EMOTION T H E lay listener should actually have far less initial trouble with Ornette Coleman 's music than a musician whose ear searches automatically for the harmonic chord changes on which he expects jazz variations to be built . ( Most musicians however agree that his writing can be superb . As one of them put it recently , " Those themes sound so fresh and beautiful . Then they start to blow and it's -- -Cape Canaveral ! " ) As for Coleman , he says , " If I am going to play on chords , I might as well write out my solo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a musical direction and a pitch for the solo . " Coleman 's variations may , in fact , be made on any of several elements of any given theme : on the pitch or suggested scales ; the emotion or mood ; the rhythm of the theme rather than chords . The soloist 's job becomes a free invention based on the general musical , rhythmic , or emotional areas that a theme suggests ; the listener who says " he sounds like someone laughing , talking , and crying " is having the soundest sort of response . There is nothing really inaccessible about the emotional variations on Coleman recordings like The Blessing , the ironic Tears Inside , Lorraine ( a memorial to pianist Lorraine Geller ) , Lonely Woman , or Peace , and most of the titles speak for themselves . And the rhythmic variations on Ramblin ' ( called by one man " a jazz version of hillbilly music " ) bring spontaneous responses from all sorts of audiences . right pitch , he carries more music in it than if he filled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete harmonic ear in jazz . Bird had the best diatonic ear . " Coleman 's innovations are basically simple , inevitable , and authentic extensions of the jazz tradition ? but they seem so only because his sublime stubbornness has made them . He has an eloquent answer to those who accuse him of inciting aesthetic chaos : " No . When I found out I could make mistakes , then I knew I was onto something . " His most far-reaching effort yet , called Free Jazz , took place in a recording studio . This is a continuous free improvisation by a " double " quartet ? Coleman and Eric Dolphy , reeds ; Cherry and Freddie Hubbard , trumpets ; Charlie Haden and Scott La Faro , basses ; Ed Blackwell and Billy Higgins , drums . The only patterns followed were a series of brief ensemble themes spaced so as to propel each soloist in turn . The rest is entirely unpremeditated , sometimes collective , improvising . And when they were finished the performance had lasted over thirty-eight minutes , long enough to fill both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the section with dual improvising by the two bass players is especially remarkable . THE REAL RENEWAL F OR all his willingness to discuss it , Coleman 's music is still largely a matter of doing , of playing , of testing ideas . The composer George Russell differs from Coleman in that he has a theory to offer . Russell 's career goes back to the first successes of modern jazz ; he wrote for both the Gillespie band and for Parker . He later evolved a theory of jazz " pantonality " based on the Lydian mode and several famous jazzmen have studied with him . Whether his rationale proves finally successful for the " new " jazz or not , it has meanwhile helped him find a renewed career as leader of an advanced sextet . Russell 's current trumpeter is a young Californian named Don Ellis , who often leads his own trios . They play a thoroughly pleasant and sometimes more or less " light-music " version of " the new thing . " ( I mean that in the sense that Johann Strauss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' music is frequently reactionary : he knows as much about Rex Stew-art 's 1930s trumpet style as he does about Dizzy Gillespie 's , and his groups are apt to abandon " modern " jazz themes and actually play familiar lines like Honeysuckle Rose or Somebody Loves Me . The soloist changes tempos and key at will , the accompanists follow . For several months , Ellis ' group held forth in a Greenwich Village coffee house where a customer was heard to mutter , " Man you got ta drink a lot of coffee to play that music ? " Ellis names contemporary classical composers like Webern and Stockhausen as major influences But players like pianist Paul Bley and saxophonist Dolphy have obviously begun as virtuoso modern jazzmen and pushed things a bit further . Bley has become a gentle lyricist . Dolphy still is a nearly ferocious technician , whose style lies somewhere between Ornette Coleman 's and that of an advanced and generally accepted modernist like John Coll rane . Dolphy readily acknowledges that Coleman " taught me a direction . " There are many problems still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passionate experience now , and hearing it is like attending the beginnings of something new , frequently beautiful , and terribly important . But no one would contend that it is a finished music , only that it is an exhilarating move in an inevitable direction for jazz . The most telling evidence of his importance is that he has introduced new ideas of rhythm and his melodies involve new ways of phrasing . Parker 's way of phrasing still clings to the improvising of Do1phy , Ellis , and several others . lito like Parker and like Armstrong before hirrt Coleman is developing a really new sensibilityfrom a new rhythmic basis . When Charlie Mingus said of him that he sounded like " a million toned bongos " he went directly to the point . And jazz history clearly shows that anyone who tries to change jazz harmonically without revising his rhythms and phrasing , inevitably risks either a bloodless affectation of meaningless sound patterns or pointless showers of technique . Ornette Coleman gets the same kind of extreme reactions both within the jazz milieu and outside that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is both praised and called a kind of fake ? among all the men mentioned in this survey of " the new thing , " Coleman is the one whose work still remains somewhat " controversial " in the fan and trade press . And this is natural , for his music takes the biggest step away from established convention into a real renewal of jazz .
