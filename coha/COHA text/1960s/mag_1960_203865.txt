Until a fortnight ago , when the island 's three Roman Catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter forbidding Catholics to vote for Governor Luis Muoz Marin and his Popular Democratic Party , Puerto Rico 's gubernatorial campaign was a race without an issue . Muoz ' opponent , Luis Ferr , candidate of the Statehood Republican Party and a partner in the island 's largest private enterprise ( Ferr Industries ) , had demanded a plebiscite on statehood , but foxy old Muoz sidetracked that issue . His party slipped a rule through the legislature that no statehood plebiscite could be held in an election year , thus reducing the campaign to platitudes . <P> But last week , as controversy over the bishops ' prohibition boiled across the island , the campaign at last had its issue : the separation of church and commonwealth . Aboard his campaign bus Muoz toured the countryside to defend himself against the bishops . " The day you begin to follow the political orders of the clergy , " he cried , " that day you will lose your freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the bishops ' points of protest , was established in 1937 by the Statehood Republicans , not by his Popular Democrats . <P> The Mortal-Sin Vote . The bishops were of no mind to let the issue die . In a second pastoral letter . James P. Davis of San Juan , Aponte Martinez of Lares and James E. McManus of Ponce reiterated and clarified their earlier warning against voting for Munoz . " To violate the law of God , which prohibits supporting a moral without God ... is a clear disobedience against God and evidently a sin . " <P> Leaving no doubt as to where Bishop McManus stood , his chancellor at Ponce . Msgr . Victor M. Nazario , added that anyone who supported Muoz Popular Democratic Party " not only commits a mortal sin but can also be excommunicated . " Taking its cue , Puerto Rico 's new Catholic Action Party , openly sponsored by Davis and McManus , took full-page daily ads in the newspapers to remind voters that " Catholics can not vote for the Popular Party . " Spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Communists obey Luis Muoz Marin . Catholics obey their bishops . " <P> Reduced Margin . While the bishops stand enlivened the island 's campaign and caused a new stir about the religion issue in the presidential campaign , it is not likely to have a decisive effect on the governorship . Like other Latin Americans , Puerto Ricans traditionally make a sharp distinction between religion and politics , and can not be expected to desert Munoz for the bishops . What is likely to cost Muoz more votes is the old statehood question . For all the maneuverings in favor of commonwealth status ( which gives Puerto Rico the advantages of being part of the U.S. without federal taxation ) , the statehood vote is growing . In 1956 , the Statehood Republicans polled 172,000 votes . This year the experts predict a 60% jump to 275,000 or more . <P> With two issues affecting his strength , Munoz seems sure to win-but not by his usual 60%-plus margin .                   @ @
