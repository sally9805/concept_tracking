On most Republican dream tickets , Nelson Rockefeller is still the No. 1 choice for the No. 2 spot . Paired as Vice President with Richard Nixon , he would have a strong attraction for independents and dissident Democrats across the U.S. , not to mention a powerful pull in New York and the other Eastern seaboard states . Last week a couple of high-level comments brought Rocky 's name once more to the fore . In New York , Dick Nixon 's good friend Tom Dewey warmly endorsed Rockefeller for Vice President , and at his Washington press conference , President Eisenhower added a cautious amen : " If Mr. Rockefeller were nominated , he would be one that would be acceptable to me . " But Rocky coldly rejected any such suggestions . " I absolutely , under no circumstances whatsoever , would be a candidate for the vice-presidency , " he said before leaving on a Venezuela vacation . " Nor would I accept a draft for the same position . " Rockefeller 's rejection was not taken as irrevocable . After all , Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his refusal in early 1948 , but ran as Dewey 's Vice President . Nixon would make no overtures to Rocky for the present , but until convention time he was not rocking the dream boat , either . <P> If Rockefeller is still unwilling in July , there are plenty who are willing and eager in April . Among the possible Vice Presidents being mentioned last week were several who could offer a geographical balance to a ticket with California 's Nixon . New York 's Senator Kenneth Keating or Massachusetts ' Henry Cabot Lodge , U.S. Ambassador to . the U.N. , have all the necessary East Coast credentials . Or Nixon could profitably pair up with a Mid-westerner-either Indiana 's Representative Charles Halleck or Interior Secretary Fred Seaton of Nebraska . If Texas ' Lyndon Johnson is not on the Democratic ticket , and if Nixon decides to make a bir effort to hold the Southern states that President Eisenhower captured in 1956 - Kentucky , Tennessee , Florida , Virginia Robert Anderson ( a Texan and an erstwhile Democrat ) could provide the necessary Southern accent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other Roman Catholic as one of their candidates , then religious considerations may influence Nixon 's choice , and the chances of Labor Secretary James P. Mitchell , a Catholic , would be enhanced . Or , if Dick Nixon decides that a progressive-conservative balance is the magic combination , Arizona 's Senator Barry Goldwater , a conservative in excellent standing , would be a logical running mate . <P> In another category are the rising young Republicans of Nixon 's own generation - men the Vice President admires and who fit his private junior-executive specifications for an able Vice President . Well up on his list of personal favorites are Michigan 's Representative Gerald R. <P> Ford , 46 , a good friend since Nixon 's early days in Congress ; Charles Percy , 40 , Chicago industrialist ( president of the Bell &; Howell Co. ) and chairman of the blue-ribbon Republican Committee on Program and Progress ( TIME , May 11 , 1959 ) ; and Attorney General William P. <P> Rogers , a New Yorker who is Nixon 's closest friend and adviser in Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
