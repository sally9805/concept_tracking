txt The nine-day sanitationmen 's strike here ended last night-under a plan by Governor Rockefeller to have the state take over temporary operation . of the city 's ' Sanitation Department . Sanitationmen began moving the nearly 100,000 tons of accumulated garbage and trash at 8:30 , about two and a half hours after the Governor broadcast the dramatic announce-. ment of the agreement . He said he would ask the Legislature in a special message tomorrow to authorize the state to take over responsibility for Sanitation Department functions under health regulations . Explaining his move , the Governor said : " There 's enough suffering on the part of the people , and I do not want to add to it or take the responsibility . " Contract Still Needed While the state is in control of the department , he ' said , the men will be paid at the rate a special mediation board recorn. , mended early Friday ? $425 year over their current wages . Even though Mayor Lindsay had rejected the rate proposed by the mediation board , Which was set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it under Mr. Rockefeller 's plan . This calls for the state to control sanitation operations as long as the State Health Commissioner finds that . there is an emergency In the lefty . The city and the UniIformed Sanitationman 's Association still must negotiate a contract . Mayor Lindsay denounced the Governor 's action as " capitulation " to a union that had gone on strike in defiance of a state law signed by the Governor that forbids walkouts by public employes . Guard Call-up Refused The Mayor had persistently urged the Governor to call out the National Guard to dean up the city , but Mr. Rockefeller refused . He said last night that such an action might cause " fighting in the , streets . " While the Mayor referred to the union demands as extortionist , the Governor reported that he had sought to have the city and the sanita.tionmen submit their dispute to binding arbitration over a difference of S25 a year a man . The city was willing to have binding arbitration with a ceiling of $375 , he said , and the union binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , he explained , and added that he had not been able to bridge the gap . " The $25 is equal to 50 cents per week per man , " he said . " That is what separates the two groups . " In view of the Mayor 's refusal to accept the mediation panel 's recommendation and his inability to establish a mutually agreeable basis for binding arbitration , the Governor said , he had worked out the other solution in which the state would take over the operation of the Sanitation Department for the duration of the health emergency The bill he will ask the Legislature to enact tomorrow would expand Section 1301 of the Public Health Law . This permits the Stale Commissioner of Health to take over a function of a municipality if he finds that the city is unable to abate a nuisance that endangers the public health . Officials in the Governor 's office said that such a step had never been taken before in the state . They also cited Section 10 of the Executive Law , which gives the Governor general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the services rendered under the state 's operation , they said , would be borne by the city . After the health emergency is ended , control of the Sanitation Department will return to the city . 2 Democrats Back Idea Shortly after the Governor announced his proposal , two influential Democratic members of the Legislature said that while they did not have details of his plan they favored the idea . Joseph Zaretzki of Manhattan , the Senate minority leader , said : " I 'd be in favor of it . I 'm not playing games with the health of the eight million people in New York City . And the Legislature will go along . " Assemblyman Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn said : " I think the Legislature certainly . should cooperate in any manner to end the serious situation we have in New York City . I do not feel this is a sellout , and I think the word blackmail ' in labor relations is not proper . " Mayor Lindsay had charged the union with " blackmail " in going on strike despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W : Brydges , the Republican majority leader of the Senate , said last night in Westbury , L. I. , where he appeared at a party dinner , that he was calling a meeting of all Republican Senators for tomorrow morning in Albany . However , he said , he was withholding comment on the Governor 's action until after hearing Mayor Lindsay 's further reaction at his news conference today . Threat of General Strike In his statement , the Governor explained ' that he had not considered it feasible to call out the National Guard . He cited the difficulties of the work , the possible injuries that inexperienced guardsmen might suffer and the high cost involved . Closely related to the Governor 's reluctance to bring in the National Guard was a threat yesterday by the New York City Central Labor Council to call a general strike if the guard was used to collect garbage . Harry Van Arsdale Jr. , the president of the council and a long-time supporter of Governor Rockefeller , made public the council 's threat after a closed meeting of the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not tolerate the use of militia against any workers . " the board warned . A general strike , if participated in by the council 's 1.2 million rank-and-file union ' members , would have involved people ranging from saleswomen , clerks and welfare workers to newspaper employes , hodcarriers and transport workers . Since labor has never staged a general strike here , there was no precedent for gauging how many workers might have stayed away from their jobs . But Mr. Van Arsdale , who had been present in the Governor 's offices at 22 West 55th Street during some of the negotiations , made it clear that the council 's warning referred to the possibility of a general strike . It was learned from participants at yesterday 's meeting of the labor leaders that there was general condemnation of Mayor Lindsay . Speaker after speaker said that if the Mayor were successful in " breaking the sanitation strike " it would be a blow to labor in general in the city . At a labor dinner last night at the Commodore , Mr. Van Arsdale praised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official should have . " He also assailed " the filthy press for their stand against labor in New York City . " Governor Rockefeller took cognizance of the dangers of calling up the guard in his statement . " I would just like to say that having military men come in to collect garbage but also to break a strike in this city would have the most serious repercussions , be inflammatory , there could be fighting on the streets , and I think we 've got trouble enough in this city , " he explained . The Governor appealed again to the Mayor to accept the recommendation of the mediation panel , but Mr. Lindsay showed no disposition toward changing his attitude in his brief comment last night . Nevertheless , the problem of a contractual settlement between the city and the sanitationmen 's union remains . It was uncertain what the union would do if it was unable to reach a new agreement prior to the state 's return of sanitation functions to the city . But if the city should then eliminate the new pay increase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Held Discussions aimed at finding a solution to the dispute went on all night Friday at the Governor 's office here . They were recessed for only a few hours yesterday while participants showered , shaved and got a little sleep . ' Mayor Lindsay , who reImained of Gracie Mansion during the night , appeared briefly before newsmen late in the morning and said he was " standing firm " and had " nothing else to say . " Asked if he meant " standing firm " on his position that the city would not pay " blackmail , " the Mayor said , in apparent anger , ' Let 's just leave it at that . " The situation was full of political overtones involving Governor Rockefeller and Mayor Lindsay , who are both Republicans and have been mentioned as possible political rivals for the White House . Another element in the complicated situation was the close relationship between Governor Rockefeller and many of the city 's top labor leaders , including Mr. Van Arsdale and John J. DeLury , president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la court order enjoining the strike . Both Mr. Van Arsdale and Mr. DeLury were strong supporters of Governor Rockefeller in his successful campaign for re-election two years ago . The council and labor leaders generally have been strongly opposed to the use of the National Guard , as Mayor Lindsay has asked . The special mediation panel set up by Governor Rockefeller and agreed to by Mayor Lindsay last Thursday came up with a recommendation for a pay increase of $425 a year for the 10,000 sanitationmen , with the rise retroactive to July 1 , 1967 . It also urged a postponement of an additional city pension contribution from April 1 , 1968 , to July 1 , 1968 . The sanitationmen now have a starting wage of $6,424 a year and get a maximum of $7,956 after three years . These were the recommenda-i tions that the Mayor rejected and the union accepted . Earlier , two of the mediators had proposed an annual increase of $300 , retroactive to July 1 , 1967 , and an additional $100 retroactive to Jan. 1 of this year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was valued at about $50 for the remaining three months of the year . The city was reportedly prepared to accept the proposals of the two mediators , and so were the leaders of the union . But the membership voted it i down at a raucous meeting in City Hall Park on Feb. 2 , and the strike began . Governor Rockefeller put the difference between the two proposals at $250,000 for the proposed one-year contract . Union leaders said they could not understand Mayor Lindsay 's refusal to agree to that relatively small pay increase . But city labor aides contended that increasing the settlement terms by that amount upset bargaining relationships with other unions and made it impossible to establish " sensible , coherent labor relations " in the city in the future . City officials had also been disturbed by what they consider to be a pattern of defiance of laws poohibiting strikes by public employes . Mayor Lindsay and his labor ' aides were known to feel that they had to draw the line somewhere if they were ever to avoid the leap-frogging efforts of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
