For weeks the Great Kennedy Recruiting Drive turned out better than one draftee a day for the New Frontier-and not even an occasional conscientious objector slowed the parade of talent into front-line jobs . But last week the recruiters stepped on a booby trap , with everybody watching . <P> Thanks largely to a speculative story in the New York Times , Georgia 's Governor Ernest Vandiver suddenly found himself pegged as a likely choice for Secretary of the Army . The reports said that two powerful Georgians , Senator Richard Russell and Congressman Carl Vinson , were pressuring Kennedy on Vandiver 's behalf . The news was as much a surprise to Vandiver , who wants to finish out his two remaining years in the statehouse , as it was to Kennedy himself , who had no intention of naming a segregationist to the sensitive Army job . To avoid embarrassment all round , Kennedy at first allowed that Vandiver was " under consideration , " then went through the motions of calling the Governor to ask if he would like the job - but let him understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ; just as agreeably , Kennedy wrote that when Vandiver finishes his term , " I hope it will be possible for you to join the Administration in a position of responsibility . " <P> At week 's end , Kennedy still did not have his Army Secretary , but the recruiting drive had filled up nearly 50 other top jobs beneath Cabinet level , left another 50 to 100 to go before Inauguration Day . Among the happier choices : <P> John Jay McCloy , 65 , director of the U.S. Disarmament Administration . Bald , brusque Banker-Lawyer McCloy , a Republican , has a flair for doing the almost impossible-a characteristic that suits his new job of supervising the new Administration 's disarmament policy . A graduate of Amherst ( ' 16 ) and Harvard Law School , McCloy began his Government life at the edge of World War II . After resigning from his Manhattan law practice , he became a troubleshooting assistant to the Secretary of War , worked in the distinguished circle that included General George C. Marshall , Robert A. Lovett , James Forrestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went briefly back to law , but in 1946 he agreed to place the disorganized International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on its financial feet . McCloy 's dictatorial methods won no friends among his fellow bank directors , but when Harry Truman drafted him for High Commissioner to Occupied Germany ( 1949-52 ) , the bank had an operational profit . In Germany , he helped an ex-mayor named Konrad Adenauer lead West Germany toward its new prosperity . McCloy then returned to private life as chairman of the Chase National ( later Chase Manhattan ) Bank but served as an unofficial , unpaid adviser on disarmament problems to the late John Foster Dulles.
