Yet throughout 1965 he was unwontedly and unhappily subdued in the shadow of a center-stage President . Not until January did Humphrey finally find an effectual and demanding outlet for his energies . It was then , at Lyndon Johnson 's behest , that the Vice President publicly helped shoulder the increasing burdens of the war in Viet Nam . <P> Since then , Humphrey has become the Administration 's most articulate and indefatigable exponent of U.S. Asian policy . From New Delhi to New Zealand to New York , before sexagenarian Senators and teen-age Thais , the pink-cheeked , peripatetic Vice President has rehearsed America 's aims and achievements in Viet Nam with all the evangelical fervor he once brought to such causes as civil rights and dis armament . <P> Seldom have man and mission been better mated .

" On a flying trip to Manhattan , he alighted in the penthouse of the Carlyle Hotel and , pounding the arms of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The war is doing for us what the Sputnik did in the space field . It 's forcing us to come to grips with Asia . " <P> For an audience of high school and college editors in New York , the Vice President answered the rote objection that the Saigon government is unstable , undemocratic and unpopular . " For many centuries , " explained Old Teacher Humphrey , " the Vietnamese people lived under mandarin rule . Then came generations of colonial domination followed by 25 years of almost constant warfare . This is stony soil for democracy to grow in .
