Russian newspapers give prominent play to horror stories about religion designed to equate the practice of Christianity with darkest superstition . The latest , timed for the Christmas season when many Russian infants are baptized , was the trial of Father Scherbatov for the murder of Vova Marchenko . <P> Vova Marchenko was three months old when his parents took him to the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in Magnitogorsk ( pop . 284,000 ) to be baptized by immersion , as is the practice of the Russian Orthodox Church . When the Rev. Ivan Scherbatov lifted little Vova from the font , the baby was dead- " the victim of a senseless rite , " as Moscow 's daily Sovietskaya Rossiya put it . Called before a People 's Court , Father Scherbatov denied his guilt , contended that the child was ill and would have died anyway . But medical investigators disputed him , and the priest was sentenced to three years in jail . The people of Magnitogorsk , said Sovietskaya Rossiya , were highly satisfied with the sentence .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
