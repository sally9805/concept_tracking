Summer is another country A Story by CHRISTINE WESTON Drawings by Thomas Feelings F .. 4 A R L Y this morning Danny Tracy came to mow the hay on my field . As he turned off the town road into mine , I felt rather than heard the ponderous tread of his horse 's great fringed feet on the ground , and the delicate creak and jingle of the mowing machine , for Danny is the only man in our neighborhood who still uses a horse and old-fashioned rig for heavy work . Still half asleep , for me the sound of these massive feet merged with the long half-dream of another time , another country . I was standing with my parents in a window overlooking a broad street somewhere in London and below us passed the slow and majestic cortege of King Edward the VII , and my half-sleeping eyes were filled once more with a sight of horses with black plumes growing from their foreheads , of grave-faced men in splendid dress , and after more than forty years my cars seemed still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long processional unwound beneath us I heard my mother saying : " That must be the Tsar ! " And my father said : " And there goes the King of Montenegro ! " In my school history book there used to he a map of Europe , and Montenegro was the smallest country in it , colored a pale lavender . As a child I always had an idea of it as being on a scale with the little painted wooden people and animals in a toy Noah 's Ark , so when I gazed down at the scene beneath that window I expected the King of Montenegro to be something tiny and in keeping with his infinitesimal domain . The thud of horses ' feet , the muted jingle of harness , drums under their covering of purple velvet  --  then 1 was really awake , and outside my window a late October sun was resuscitating a few frozen flies , and 1 could hear Danny Tracy deep in conversation with his horse . I dressed and put the kettle on for coffee and went outdoors . Danny had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched his old gray coat and the horse 's pointed ears and made a channel of golden pallor on the fallen hay . What stood had a pink glow in it like the reflected heat from a distant fire , and as Danny came to the end of the field and turned , the starlings arrived  --  hundreds of them from no-28 SUMMER IS ANOTHER COUNTRY where , black , glittering flakes which settled down in the fallen hay to feed on the crickets and the exposed seeds of summer . When Danny reached the steps where I stood , he paused to say hello and I saw the tobacco juice trickling down his face , which , at seventy-six , had taken on the color and texture of old , weevil-ridden wood . " Nice day , " he said . " Wind in the nor'west , looks like we 're in for a stretch of fine weather . " Country people deal in the obvious as they deal in small coin . It is often all they possess . " You 're late this year , Danny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would ever get around to taking the hay . " He laid the reins on the horse 's back and looked at me . " Been awful busy this fall . Hattie , she suddenly got one of her spells of wanting something new , and nothing would do but what we got to put in a bathroom . " He brought it out with intense deliberation , as though speaking of childbirth or a serious operation . " A bathroom , mind you . After fifty years of doing without one , she suddenly got to have a bathroom for no better reason bur that Nita Merrit just got one . " I looked at the horse , named Hero , standing stoically in his collar , his blond mane exactly the color of the hay around him . Seen in profile , Danny and his horse had the look of relatives  --  one perpendicular , spare as a stick , with a great curving nose , the other horizontal , huge , with a nose like a landslide , and both of them  --  man and horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had employed to install the new bathroom , and before answering he sent a jet of tobacco juice over the off-wheel , then : " Hollis Merrit from Machias . Rest there is , and I figured we going to sink all that money in a drain , might as well do it right . " Hero changed feet and flipped his long blond tail and Danny went on : " One reason I been so long getting around to your field , I been helping Hollis with the ditching for the bathroom drain . Takes two men and it ai n't rightly Hollis 's job nohow . Was n't he 's cousin to Hattie , he never would lay a hand to a shovel , what with his education and all . " " But what about you , Danny ! " I exclaimed . Born in India of French and English parents , Christine Weston married an American in 1923 . She lives in Maine but travels a good deal , and has written many stories and several novels , including " Indigo " and " The Wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? " He looked as if he might crack in two like an old dried-out plank . I went on : " Ca n't you get one of the younger men around to lend a hand ? " " Lend a hand digging a drain ? " His laugh was toothless and interior . " You ever tried to get one of them young ones to do chores around here for you ? No sir . They got other ideas , and I ca n't say that I blame them . Driving trucks or working at a filling station is more to their taste , and that 's like it ought to be . " I started to disagree , but he continued as if he had n't heard : " Take my own two boys . Junior 's with that bus outfit as a driver and pulling down a good salary , and Paul 's working in a coffin factory over to Boston , Mass . Why should they be wanting to hang around home , breaking their backs shoveling manure or working off their taxes fixing the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins and looked at me with tiny bright blue eyes . " You given any thought to what you 're going to do about having the hay cut after I 'm gone ? " " Gone ? " 1 echoed , uncomprehending . " Where in the world are you planning to go , Danny ? " He laughed and slapped the reins on Hero 's broad back . " Well , we all got a choice between one of two places , ai n't we ? Guess I 've lived a good clean life , so I ai n't worrying too much . " He spoke to Hero , who turned massively , drawing the light machine after him , and I watched them start another swath , disturbing the starlings which rose as one , described a glittering circle over Danny 's head , then sank like a black snow storm in the leveled hay . I WENT into the house and made breakfast and carried my coffee cup to the window where I could see Danny and his big brown horse move up and down the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking myself what , indeed , I would do when he was gone . Ours is not a wealthy or fashionable part of the world and labor is scarce and for the most part unskilled . Men and women of Danny 's generation and a little younger grew up in an age when there were few if any mechanical devices . They worked with their hands and with animals . As he said , their children have other ideas , and it is typical of a man like Danny , who knows well the rigors of adversity , to desire a different history for his sons . When I walk through our little town or drive along these country roads , it is always the elderly men that I sec doing the hard work  --  straightening heavy granite sills , raising chimneys , painting barns , carpentering , digging , planting , sawing . They have the know-how and they move as Danny moves , with deliberation , aware without sentimentality or regret that there is no hurry about anything , any more . When he had made a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside my steps and got down and stretched , then sat beside me in the sun and drank a cup of coffee while Hero bent his great nose into the pail of water I had remembered to draw for him at the kitchen sink . " Good to see the hay come down , " I said , looking out on the level sweep of the field which glistened in the sun . ' ' When its all cleared , it seems to hold the winter back a little . Things look more the way they do in spring , before the grass has begun to grow . " Danny sucked the coffee between his three remaining teeth and said : " Before you bought this place I used to mow it sometimes , for Asa Men-it . Always been good friends , Asa and me , but I never did get along with his wife Nita . Do n't to this day , and probably never will . " I asked what had caused the trouble , and he gave his sibilant , almost inaudible laugh . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd as soon be shot as let Nita think so . All happened on account of her cat . " H E R 0 finished drinking and fluttered his velvety lips in a great sigh of satisfaction , and Danny went on : " Nita Merrit always was kind of soft in the head about them darned cats of hers . Ever noticed how some women get that way ? Over cats , I mean . You do n't hardly ever see a man make a fool of himself over cats . Over dogs yes , maybe over horses . " He gazed for a moment at Hero , who stood before us staring thoughtfully at the ground . But not over cats , " Danny said . " Or at any rate I never see a man go plumb crazy over a cat the way some women do . " He tucked a fresh quid of tobacco into his cheek and continued : " Nita always owned cats and does to this day , as you know . We11 , it must of been ... howold 's my boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago it happened . Nita had a whole raft of cats then , but her favorite , or so she made it out to be at the time , was a big ugly brindled torn with one eye but plenty of everything else . Spent his time getting all the other cats in the neighborhood into trouble . Anyways , he was a great hunter . He 'd kill anything from mice to rabbits , but Nita  --  she claimed she loved all animals , only cats the most  --  Nita held out that that darned yellow torn of hers , he would n't hurt a flea . No more he did , I bet  --  he was full of ' em . " Danny chewed meditatively for a moment . " You know how some parents are apt to be about a worthless kid ? The more worthless and no-account , the more they dotes on him . Well , that 's the way Nita Merrit was about that brindled torn . She lived in mortal fear something would happen to him when he was off on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cat 'd learned that when the hay 's cut all kind of small humble critters suddenly comes to the surface and the birds come down to feed on ' em . Minute he heard Hero and me coming down the road he 'd take after us . No matter if we was going a mile , or two miles , every time I looked back over my shoulder there was Nita 's yellow torn loping along , enough murder in his one eye as would have done for twenty normal cats . When time come to cut the hay , there was Nita standing on her doorstep hollering for me to wait until she got the torn into the house . Sometimes she did , sometimes he was too smart for her and was up the road and ahead of us . It most drove Nita 30 SUMMER IS ANOTHER COUNTRY out of her mind because she was afeard he 'd get lost in the long hay and my cutter-bar would shear the legs offen him . Or else Hero would step on him . She made me swear I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd be sure to have that maneater tucked safely in his crib , the little darling . Goddam him . " Danny chewed his cud , and I listened to the crickets ticking in the fresh-cut grass . Danny went on : " One day 1 came down here to mow as usual , and I guess I must of had something on my mind because so help me I clean forgot to warn Nita I was coming , and would n't you know it would be just that one day it had to happen ? I never even see that old yellow cat stalking the starlings until the cutter-bar was right atop of him , and then it was too late . " Danny looked at me gravely . " I 'd always heard tell that a cat has nine lives , and that was one time when wished it had been true . But that poor darned cat was a goner the minute the cutter-bar went into him , and I had to break the news to Nita myself because Asa said he 'd be shot if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , thinking of Nita Merrit , big-bosomed , fierce-eyed and vocal , mother of eight children and an untold number of cats . Danny was silent a moment , then : " Do n't know as you ever heard  --  you ai n't been here too long  --  but my boy Paul had been going with Nita 's daughter Ann Marie ever since they was in grade school together . It was one or those things do n't often happen in real life , but we all knew  --  that is , Hattie and I knew , Asa and Nita knew , all our friends knew , that those kids meant everything to each other . Of course they 'd have to have waited until they was both out of school , but everybody understood how it was going to be between them  --  until the day my cutter-bar got Nita 's brindled torn , and I had to carry him back dead in my handkerchief , and the moment 1 laid that defunct cat on her doorstep , that was it . Accident or no accident did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'd sawed the legs off Nita herself , it could n't have been more terrible the way she carried on . " " And the kids ? " I asked . " What happened to them ? " " Nita broke it up . She sent Ann Marie away to live with relatives in New Jersey , and she scared Hattie and me so with her threats , we prevailed on Paul to try and forget all about it . " Danny sighed . " I do n't know now but what we made a big mistake . Paul was always the quietkind and he made out like he was taking the whole thing sensibly , but the day Ann Marie went away , he swallowed the poison which 1 always kept in the barn , against rats , and he like to have died . Oh , he got over it , and now he 's married to someone else and got two kids and I guess he do n't waste much time brooding over Ann Marie Merrit . Though I do n't know . Conies over me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to kill yourself over something , it must kind of stay with you one way and another , the rest of your life . " A L L day I could see Danny mowing the hay , and then it was finished and lay flat and shining in the sun , and he raked it into windrows and pitched it into the haycart on which he 'd put old automobile tires , and I watched him working , a lean old man in shabby clothes , old but still lithe , and when the hay was piled in the cart the field emerged strange and green as in early summer , and presently I saw Danny walking toward the house carrying something in his hand and smiling in a pleased sort of way . down the steps to meet him and he 1 went held out the object  --  a silver watch , stained and tarnished , but with its glass intact . " Found this right where I must have dropped it , " he said . " Been calculating , and I figure it was in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The watch had stopped at 12:30 and the mainspring was gone , but Danny gazed at it fondly . " My uncle sent me that watch from Switzerland year Hattie and I was married , and I felt real bad when I lost it . Hunted everywhere for it , and f must have combed this field inch by inch at the time , but never did find it . Then today when I was lifting a pitchfork of hay back there halfway acrost your field , 1 see the light hit something and it gave back a great spark , like it was trying to catch my eye  --  and there it lay where it been lying for going on nineteen years ! " " Suppose you can have it fixed so it . will run ? " I asked , but he shook his head . " Would n't hardly be worth it . And anyway , there will always be one time of day when it 'll be Lulling the right time . Guess I 'd rather leave it at that . " He clambered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I stood and watched two seasons move away down my little road , and I could hear the starlings , hundreds of them , feeding in the young , frail green of next year 's grass .
