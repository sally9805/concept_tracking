Once again French paratroopers came to Lon Mba 's rescue . Steel-helmeted paras sent in quickly by Charles de Gaulle had saved the Gabonese President 's skin only two months ago , when his 400-man army pulled a predawn coup and replaced him briefly with Op position Leader Jean-Hilaire Aubame ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . In putting down that rising , the French troopers killed 27 Gabonese soldiers , then spirited Aubame off to an island just outside the port capital of Libreville , decided to stay on in the former French colony to keep an eye on things . Back in power , Mba and his advisers felt it best to allow opposition candidates on the ballot in last week 's long-delayed election ; it had been Mba 's systematic stifling of the opposition that had triggered the revolt . <P> This time around , Mba took out autocrat insurance . His bullyboys kidnaped an estimated 1,000 opposition supporters , dumped them hundreds of miles deep in the bush on election day . Even at that , anti-Mba candidates captured 53% of the popular vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settler votes that went almost unanimously to Mba in Libreville , his Bloc Dmocratique Gabonais Party won 31 of the National Assembly 's 47 seats . Immediately , a call for a general strike went up , and angry youths began gathering in Libreville 's shady , bungalow-lined streets . But truckloads of paratroopers and Gabonese gendarmes roared out to take station at key points in the city . With that , the opposition threat subsided - for the time being .
