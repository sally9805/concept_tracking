" Kill ! Kill ! " The seedlings in their beds were little inches . On a fine day in the fifth month we were drawing the new fields into hills with hoes , to ready them for transplants . The boy master was away , gone to gamble on the quail fights at the Spring of the Precious Bushel , on the Twin Hills road , though he had not , we had heard , been admitted to the rich young landlords ' secret society that presided over these and other sports ; we were forced , humiliating as it might be to ourselves , to picture him as a bumpkin hanger-on  --  in whose weak , uncallused hand , however , our fates lay like careless dice . He was as powerful to us as God  --  a hateful pariah god . My own life had changed , from root to leaf . I attended Peace with Auntie and Harlot every hour away from the fields , and sometimes at work , too . New thrills each day ! Smart 's teaching had been intensified ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many passages to commit to memory . I knew plans . I knew as I hoed in the afternoon that Harlot would in time strike up a hymn which would call certain men to a meeting with other owners ' slaves that night at Yen 's water hole , a teaching , and that a line in the old-language song would announce the place : " I met dear Joshua down by the water . . . And after dark that night , to be sure , some of us set out , loopingaround through the millet fields to the track to Twin Hills that the yellows called Favorable Wind Brook Road . Peace 's massive , work-shelled , ascetic hand was on my shoulder , and under one arm I carried three large scrolls for Smart . To no sound but the whispers of skin on sandy dirt , we made our way by the light of a greenish rind of the moon . Here was the spring  --  a black water hole in a basin of cattletrampledground on a sidehill , with a backdrop of twisting trees  --  honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murk , some sort of low plank walkway set up on stakes and laid out to the center of the pool for the dipping up of water in buckets ; a long scar on the edge of the open area  --  a ground for the yellows ' game of pitchpot , perhaps ; a dozen men squatting on their hams . " Have they come ? " Peace asked at large.  | " Sheep Wu is bringing the fellow out from the Canal Bund , " a voice said . " We can go ahead , then , " Peace said . Auntie , Harlot , and I , the only women present , were tolerated , I sensed , as Peace 's appendages ; he snapped his fingers , and Auntie drew out from her sleeve a small chimneyed lamp , and Harlot struck a flint and blew up a taper to light it with , and I handed Smart his scrolls . Then we three drew back as Smart and a freed slave , named Fan , a mix , gathered the others around them and read to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ditcher ; grunts and jokes . Some , too , whom I had seen at teachings at the smithy in Yen 's woods : Wang 's Judge , Ch'eng 's Candy , and others . The tiny light was poor ; Fan , the free mixie , faltered reading the words : " Slavery  --  lives  --  in the  --  house  --  of  --  force . The white  --  the white man  --  the white man descends  --  therein  --  to thestate  --  ofa  --  domestic  --  animal .... " The slow , awkward diction burned in my ears . I had come to know long since that none of this was a drunken joke over a magic circle ; that what seemed to be a kind of madness in Peace was , if seen in a certain dark-night way , rather an absolute clarity , an obsession , a gradual shaping of our energies . Helpless as we were , we were going to . . . going to .. . " Here ! Look ! " A hand picked up the little lamp , and the effulgence soared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , though the face seemed to lop out in the uneven lamplight  --  till the lamp , a tiny star glistening on its chimneyside , moved across , and I saw that one cheek really was swollen , and that the round of the cheek had been burned with a branding iron : the character tsei , meaning " thief . " This was new , unhealed . I heard Auntie 's wheezing shocked intake of breath . Ditcher made a growling show of indignation . Peace hung back . Smart read , with greater facility than Fan , the freedman , from the famous Secret Scroll of the South Island Colony . A certain philosopher , Hsieh Fu-tzu , had advocated in this document , an aide-memoire to the Emperor of an oral proposal Hsieh had made , that the whites be set free , colonized to South Island , off the far-southern coast , " with arms , implements of household and of the handicraft arts , seeds , pairs of animals . . . a free and independentpeople ... "  |p252The  plan had been summarily suppressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a loud voice in the Emperor 's ear . A man in our cluster by the water hole said he had heard that Philosopher Hsieh might be elevated to Minister of the First Rank , in charge of the writing of new laws on agriculture . Might he help us ? Then another slave said that his owner had called Philosopher Hsieh a coward  --  said he had put his tail between his legs during the sack of Tatung twenty years back . Let nine hundred Mongols simply walk in . Did nothing beforehand to mend the breach in the Great Wall . Sank the cannons in a lake . Left the slaves to flounder . Packed up and rode off with all the yellows . At this Ditcher rose to his feet , fists clenched , growling , as if to say in his stupid mute way : Who dares to slander this friend of the white man ? Peace 's voice , severe and sharp : " Do n't count on Hsieh ! " Peace 's omission of the minister 's honorific title had the most startling effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be speakingdirectly to Ditcher , and the giant sat down , discomfited and grumbling . " Hsieh owns slaves , " Peace said . " Fifty . A hundred . It 's alltalk . Set the whites free ! If his heart bled for slaves , why didn'the manumit his own ? He could have done that . Like all theirscholars , ' their good men . ' They talk one way and act another . " Now a voice at the edge of the circle said , " We 're here , Peace . " " Is that you , Sheep Wu ? " " We 've been here some time . " " Bring him up to the light . " The small lamp had been placed on the plank walkway , and now a slender white man , a sailor , to judge by his clothes , came and crouched on his knees and bare feet on the planks , the lamp between his spread legs . The light cast upwards showed the hollow of his thin chest , and veins serpentining on the drawn muscles of his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black shadows where his eyes should have been . Sheep Wu , a free white who lived as a beggar in Twin Hills , with a mass of fleecelike curly hair , said in a hushed voice that the man on the planks was a free man of Peach Mountain Island off the mid-coast of the southeast , who had come to tell us of the whites ' successful revolt there , and of The Saint . " White brotherhood under God ! ' " the sailor began , using Thep253Saint 's slogan . " I am glad to come here to you . " He spoke in an odd , broad dialect , which we could barely understand . " I was a sugar slave . " He started the story . " Nine years ago . . . " Sometimes his hands flew out , and shadows , as of scattering birds , flapped across his face  --  and I shuddered , seeing for the first time , as he went deeper and deeper into horror , what I was involved in , and how far . If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A torch touchinga silk screen in the Yew Ah plantation house . Men running with cane knives lashed to the ends of staves . A wall of flame in the dry sugar fields . Drunkenness : Kill ! Kill ! A yellow landlord bound between two boards and sawed into sections . Fire ! A snow of fiery fragments of cane leaves carried on the wind and falling on the thatched roofs of the North Cape City . The gruesome cruelty of The Saint 's lieutenants  --  one of them had had a banner showing the corpse of a yellow infant impaled on a pole . . . . Then a word picture of The Saint : fierce yet humane , the short figure , pale pale pale face , huge eyes , upturning nose , long stained teeth , a man nearly sixty years old , master  --  yes , that word  --  master of a small island where slavery has been overthrownand the white zealot is king ... . When the amazing story was finished , Peace , in three or four short , blunt sentences , proposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in South-of-the-River , against our owners , the yellows . " Yes ! Yes ! " A moanlike assent . " When ? " A sharp tenor voice asked . " We will discuss that when we meet next time . " And that was all . That was all . We stood around after Sheep Wu took the Peach Mountain sailor away . I heard Ditcher muttering discontentedly ; he was not fond of being put down as Peace had put him down about PhilosopherHsieh . I moved nearer . " I do n't take such things from any man ! Does he think his secret name is The Saint ? How many secret names does he think he has ? " I sensed among the others a furtive sympathy for Ditcher , a shrinking from Peace 's fanaticism in the moment of being overpowered by it . Shaken to the edges . of self-control by the sailor 's tale , and appalled by Peace 's word , " war , " I was now seized with a panic fear that Ditcher might blurt out Peace 's secret name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Could he ? Would he dare if he did ? On the way home , as the piece of moon fell low in the sky , wep254stopped by the road while Peace , to my terror , in a sphere of lamplight , prepared , in the name partly of our white God of wrath and partly of some horrible yellow witchery , a conjuration against Top Man  --  a piece of shed snakeskin , spit , a knot of the vine called devil 's shoestring  --  to be placed in a chink of Top Man 's hut , to prevent his reporting our absences at night , on pain of losing his manhood . Maybe the slaveherd would see the charm jammed in a crack in the straw-bound mud ; maybe someone would help him by chance to see it ! Then , in hysteria , Top Man would hold his tongue . The preaching , to slaves from the farms along the canal , the farms of Chao , the other Yen , Chi Kuo , Ma , and our Yen , was held in an abandoned tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tavern ; Big Master Chi Kuo had given permission , thinking our superstitions harmless . The long shed with vented walls was crammed with slaves sitting cross-legged on the brick floor . Smart was the ostensible preacher , but he seemed to speak with Peace 's tongue , and the tongue spoke obliquely of the one subject that had been on my mind day and night since the meeting at Yen 's water hole . War . Peace 's war . With wheel-like motions of his hands describing the contours , Smart cast up before our eyes an allegorical picture of Twin Hills with its two eminences divided by the deep gulley of High Thoughts Creek : " And the white God stood with His two feet that day on the Mount of Olives , and the Mount of Olives divided in the middle toward the east and toward the west , so there was a valley , and half the mountain removed toward the one side and half toward the other , and the white God stood with one foot on each side , and He looked down and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hewing and digging and planting and transplanting and being bambooed and being cheek-branded and lifting and chopping with hoes and walking on the ice and carrying and striking the leaves and prizing the leaves and plowing and hacking at stumps and ai , white God , suffering , suffering , suffering , suffering .... " The illusion of Smart 's turning into Peace was astonishing . Peace stood directly behind Smart , moving with Smart 's motions.  |p255his  gestures precisely Smart 's ; it was as if he were manipulating Smart 's lithe body , and as if Smart could only choose words Peace wanted him to use . Smart 's voice fled more and more from the mild , sweet tones of his own throat toward the deep , commanding sounds of Peace 's . Harlot had whispered to me once that Peace could change himself into a cow , a cat , a horned owl  --  why not into his slave companion ? I was standing with Auntie and Harlot behind Peace , and I could see his left cheek pushed out , for he had in his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " of the sort that David used to kill Goliath . " " Behold ! The day of the Lord cometh in the city of two hills and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee , for the city shall be taken , and the houses rifled , and the women ravished , and half of the city shall go forth into captivity , and the body servant shall . . . " My blood was pounding in my ears . I had come to the preachingdesperately tired that afternoon , because it had rained the day before , and we had been put to the frantic work of drawing the finger-length seedlings of tobacco  --  " Chekiang fan-leaf " and " sweet-breathed "  --  from their beds and rushing them to the fields and setting them out in their mellow hills , and Overseer Li and Top Man , the slaveherd , nerves frayed by the insistent need to finish the transplantation while the ground was damp , had cursed , shouted , and openly struck blows . I had ached from running , bending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart raced , I felt giddy with a trembling joy that was mixed with dread . . . . Jericho straitly shut up , locked up : I have given into thine hand the mighty men of valor , ' saith the Lord  --  " I could hear a stirring , a kind of sigh , move through the gathering. "  --  and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword ! " There were moans now among the listeners . With a growing understanding of Smart 's call to act , a kind of frenzy , which was appallingly reckless , spread through the crowd . At the height of this emotion , this burst of realization , there came a roar from Peace 's throat much like those we had heard at the beginning of his visions.  |p256But  it was from Smart 's throat ! Smart 's hands were stretched upward , his fists were clenched , his eyes were lifted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same pose . Each slave in the whole house seemed rigidly frozen in mid-breath . Smart 's voice , indistinguishablefrom Peace 's , cried out , " He will smite them hip and thigh ! " In the midst of the fiercest exultation I had ever felt , I had a moment 's thrust of panic : Would Smart , unhinged by this housefulof excitement , say Peace 's forbidden name ? But then Smart 's lips were closed again , and again the same voice was heard  --  this time from Peace 's own mouth . " Yea ! Yea ! Yea ! " the voice shouted . " The spirit of the Lord moves in me . " Now , with a sudden settling to earth that was startling in itself , Smart , his body relaxed , his eyes on the faces before him , spoke in his own gentle , quiet tones . " All those men who are with Peace , " he said , " stand up . All those who are not with him yet , stay seated on the floor where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murmurs . Enthusiasm and doubts almost visible , like mists . Just what did it mean to be " with Peace " ? Changes of mind . One by one the self-elected stood , until there were about a dozen men on their feet . Smart said to them , " Come over to Yen 's water hole . Peace has some drams for you men that are men . " At this four or five more were emboldened and stood up . The preaching was over , then , and there was a sudden stirring of talk in the tobacco house . We left with Peace and his volunteers , and as we walked away the building sounded like a spent pork barrel thrumming with bluebottle flies . Auntie , Harlot , and I carried the jugs , with finger loops of porcelain at their stout throats , over to Yen 's water hole . Solemn had a bucket and a dipper , and Tree a basket of bowls . When we arrived it was nearly sunset . I had not seen Yen 's water hole by day ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesquelytwisted , the plank walk less a pier , than they had seemed in the hollow night . Peace himself poured the spirits from the jugs ; Smart diluted the portions with water from the spring . Peace spoke to each manp257as he handed him a bowl , and he touched every one , putting his big hand on a shoulder , or a forearm , or an unkempt head of hair . The excitement of the preaching carried over , and , indeed , as the men drank , it grew . They gave little yelps of what sounded like astonishment at their own boldness . After a time Peace said , " We need captains . Whom shall we have for captains ? " Voices shouted : " Peace ! " " Fan the mix ! " " Ditcher ! " " Judge ! " " Candy ! " " Sheep Wu ! " Nothing explicit was said about the war at any time . I tried to imagine its shape , its beginning  --  but Peace left everything to the slaves ' own minds , until , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves ( at least I had , and I supposedthey had ) to wildest inner thoughts of insolence , valor , retribution , revenge , revenge , Peace began to give himself over , as I had never heard him do , to puffing and gasconading ; he was talking like a master . I intercepted some looks between pairs of the men who had been named as captains  --  careful glances that meant headshakes . Those looks frightened me . " You 're going to see Peace walking around in there . " He had begun speaking of the beautiful yamen , designed by Philosopher Hsieh , which housed the Emperor 's provincial governor and his mandarins in Twin Hills . " Listen ! Peace is going to step through the red-flag gate there , and you 'll hear Peace 's heels echo in the Hall of Obeisances , bare feet slapping on the stone floor ! And Peace is going to sit at a long silk-covered table , with silver bowls , and silver chopsticks , and incensed candles in the lamps , and wine , right at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ts'ao Hsi-kuei , and Third Minister Hsieh , and Feng and Li and T'ang and Wu and ... " The moment of appalling vanity was saved by Peace 's beginning to laugh . He bent over and raised up and began to howl , hoot , snigger , bay , snort , shake , guffaw , chuckle , slap , gag , bellow . The others caught it . I caught it . The woodland cove echoed with our bloodletting seriousness leaking out in helpless laughter . Until we realized that it was dark . " Captains come over to the Camp of Dan , " Peace said . Now this was the summit of recklessness : to go along to a secret meeting just after dark , without a discretionary wait forp258the deep of night , to walk along outside your own place without an overseer 's pass when you knew patrols were sure to be ranging  --  the half-drunk squads of poor yellow farmers , hired for this prowling by landowners ; resentful , bloodthirsty , bored , on the hunt for night wanderers and gatherings of slaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , for it seemed clear that women should not go to the smithy at this risky time , butPeace called out with a loudness that made me shiver , " My handmaidens ! " He wanted us near him . He wanted Harlot to hum as we walked ... . Someone lit the lamp in the blacksmith shop , and before it was hung on the joist , Fan , the mix , said he had something to show us . A ring of heads . A hand holding up the lamp . At the center a torn piece of paper from some unimportant official document , with the chop , or printed seal , a stylized picture in a red as dark as dried blood , representing the authority of Sun , the warlord of South-of-the-River Province . " What is it ? Smart , what is it ? " Smart bent low . " Sun Hou-tzu , " he said . " The monkey who became a god . " I had had only a taste of the liquor , but I felt a slippage of restraint . Smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twin Hills , the pebble in Peace 's cheek , the men volunteering for the unclear war , Peace 's visionary boasting , and now this blood-red hint of transcendence  --  it all made me giddy with confidence in myself and in these men who were going to fight a war of which I could not see the shape . For me the room whirled with something like hope . The men were miffing about , praying and laughing . The next I knew Peace was standing at the center of the sooty room , holding up his teeth-edged mule bone , booming in the old language , " With the jawbone of an ass , heaps upon heaps , with the jawbone of an ass will I slay a thousand men . " Smart was on his knees praying softly . Peace threw the bone down on the ground , his lips drawn back in a grimace . " This place is called Ramathlehi ! " Then he put a hand to his throat as if he were half choking . " I am sore athirst . Now I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall into the hands of the uncircumcised . " He fell , at any rate , to the ground , and groveled there , and reached for the bone , and seemed to drinkp259from it , and as he did , he gradually rose up on his knees like a man renewed by decency , forgiveness , good food , honorable treatment . " This place is called Enhakkore ! Enhakkore ! " Early one morning a few days later , the first market day in the sixth month , Peace went up to the office and procured from Overseer Li five passes to go to Twin Hills to sell eggs and fowl that we unmarried women had raised  --  passes for himself , Solemn , Auntie , Harlot , and me  --  and we set out on foot toward the Yen landing on the canal , through a landscape glistening in pure sunlight after three days of rain . Little skies of rainwater still lay in the cart track ; I loved to break their mirroring with splashes of my bare feet . Auntie , Harlot , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pullets , their feet tied together , hanging upside down from one hand , and the same number of cockerels in the other ; Peace carried four fat brown hens . Peace told us as we walked through the woods that he would be talking during the day with many key men , and that no matter what was spoken he wanted all of us to cling nearby him , as if we were a group engaged with him and his men in commonplace gossip . At Yen 's landing Peace hailed , as it passed along the far bank , a train of four shallow-draft cargo barges , each carrying twenty or thirty hogsheads of prized tobacco , being towed in file by a pair of donkeys and under charge of four white bargemen , slaves out on hire . At Peace 's call the men halted the donkeys , and a couple of them poled one of the boats across to us on the landing , and for one copper cash each we went aboard , and we floated along the canal that way , to the harsh cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair swinging as he turned his head this way and that , the scar that rode his eyebrow seeming unusuallyprominent under the luminous sky , pointed out to Harlot and me pretty sights along the way  --  a heroic willow , the Chi Kuo big house , the ferry for towing-animals across the mouth of the canal where it debouched into the river , and then , going downstreamon the river , the landings of farms more famous than ours , the bare-ribbed wreck of a barge , an island 's upstreamp260prow mustached with snags of driftwood . The huge man was calm , sensitive , and tender with us . The world seemed new-made under the rain-washed sky , and , feeling the warm sunlight soak to the pit of my stomach and watching the play of Peace 's powerful arms , I thought for a moment of that small , dark room at Chao-er 's tavern in the Northern Capital ; suddenly I was overwhelmed with a sensuous aching . I was young , I tilted my face up to the sun and closed my eyes , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wide apart . . . . Then I opened my eyes again and I looked into Peace 's , and I saw not merely single-mindedness but something more that sent my daydream flying in disorder across the riverscape : a steely stiffness inside him , a control , an unwillingness to deviate by a hairbreadth from his set way , an absolute inflexibility of mind and spirit . " What about the bargemen ? " Solemn asked . " Who will enlist them ? " " Sheep Wu is speaking to the best of them , " Peace said . The city 's edge was abrupt on the left bank ; crowded trees and small farms gave way to crowded houses all at once . The bargemen carried us to the far end of the town , to the Canal Bund , which looked like a fortification from a distance , with its tobacco and grain and timber and merchandise landings and its severe godowns . We disembarked . Peace asked around for a certain leader of the godown boys whom Smart knew , and we finally found him cleaning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peace spoke to the man 's bent back . " Are you King ? " The man straightened up ; he smelled like Overseer Li 's foul pipe . " My name is King . They call me "  --  he smiled  --  " Mandarin King . " Peace set his hens down in the dust , and Solemn his young fowl ; the creatures flapped their wings two or three times but , finding themselves helpless in their fetters , subsided , lying on their sides , heads up , seeming to swallow and blinking their waxy lids over their astonished eyes . " I often heard my friend speak of you , " Peace said . " Yen 's Smart . " I saw this slave arrogantly eying Harlot . " I know Smart as well , " King said , " as I know my hand fingers and foot toes . " " Would you like a dram with me ? "  |p261To  my surprise Auntie , chewing her tongue with carefulness , pulled a bottle of millet liquor  --  it was nearly empty  --  out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you have water , " King said . " We 'll get some . Harlot , get me some water . " Harlot went shooting off to ask for a well . Peace and King remained silent the entire time until she returned cautiously balancing a rusted tin pan of water . The men drank . The sharing of the spirits seemed to be a kind of bargaining and dealing between them ; they shook hands after it . Peace said , " Are you a true man ? " " I 'm a truehearted man . Yes . I am . Your friend Smart knows me if you do n't . What business is it of yours ? " " I 'd like to take you to a Lamaist temple down our way . " " No , " the other said , " not King . Not Mandarin King . They say Lamaists never get to yellow heaven . " " Well , I do n't really mean a Lamaist temple . Listen , Mandarin King , if that is what you call yourself . Smart says you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " The two big men reminded me of boys bristling on the edge of a fistfight . " You going to swear to me you 'll keep your word ? " " I do n't know . Depends . " " Can you keep a close mouth ? " " You are talking to a fox , " King said . " Fox does n't talk , he bites . " " I like that , " Peace said , looking as though he did not . " I am going to tell you something . " " How many drams have you had ? " King jeered . " I tell you this , you godown boy : The smallies are going to fight the yellow people . We have captains . We are going to fight them and get free of them all . Are you willing to be a captain , King ? " The most violent storms flew in an instant across King 's face , for he saw that Peace was in homicidal earnest , he grasped at once the danger in those short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred , he was terrified by the importance of the secret and by its despair  --  all this in a blink , a twitching pull of one cheek  |p262Then  , with a too grand coolness that made Peace frown , he said , " I never was so glad to hear of anything in my life  --  why , son , they ought to have taken that consideration a long time back . Oh , I am , and I will be  --  I am ready to join you any moment . I am ready , son . I could cut the yellow peoples ' throats like sheep for meat . " " My name is Peace , not son . ' Do n't you forget my name , Captain . " Peace 's face was sullen . " I rejoice you came along here , Captain Peace , " King sunnily said . " I am going to send you messages , King . Maybe you will get to be a captain . " The men shook hands again , and it was clear that both were now bound by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the misery each had seen in his time . " You can hold your tongue , " Peace said . " If you know any sound or steady-hearted men , you can speak to them about this , King . But know them well first . Do n't speak a word of this in the three of us . Peace said , " These are not women , King . They are Peace 's handmaidens . " And Peace 's eye was suddenly so clouded by his dreadful prophetic look that even this arrogant King seemed to cringe . So it went all day : Peace seeking out reliable slaves he knew , or had heard about , and , with a directness that took for granted whole volumes , whole preachings , night meetings , drafty hovels , seas of millet meal and rancid pork fat , years of yes-venerable , lifetimes of aching  --  plunging right in , and leaving all details to later " messages , " he proposed the general fight against the yellows , and one by one the men , after nothing more than brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought and promptly agreed to go wherever it would lead them . From the Canal Bund we went up East Dragon Street , the main thoroughfare of the city , with Hsing Temple Hill ashine on our right , sloshing and squidging up the middle of the muddy , unpavedstreet , picking our way in single file at certain bad crossingsalong dikes of ashes and cinders that merchants had put out for pathways , which pricked the soles of our mud-caked feet and made Harlot and me giggle as we quick-footed along , until we came to the market , a great open shed , crowded with poor yellowsand country and city slaves buying and selling and bartering.  |p263Here  we sold our eggs and fowl , and bought a bottle of Shaochiuspirits with the proceeds , and here we spent the better part of two hours as Peace , moving through the crowd with narrowed eyes , found men he wanted to see and took them , with his retinue always following , out for privacy of talk into the open field that sloped beyond the market shed down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , was a dazzling patchworksight , for women , both yellows and slaves , washing clothes in the stream after the several days ' rain , were spreading out their clothes to dry and bleach on the grass ; we could hear their openairshouts and laughter on the one side and the contained hum of the market on the other as Peace put drams and the war to man after man . Peace drank with each one , but there was no change in him , unless it was a deepening of his obsession in his throat , a surer note of authority with each successive proposal as he became invisiblydrunk , more , it seemed , on astonishment at the universal acceptance of the risk he asked than on raw spirits . From the market we went down to the Rock Landing , a wharf built around a broad , flat rock at the mouth of High Thoughts Creek , where scores of small craft were tied up , and where Peace spoke to three cormorant fishermen 's slaves , and then we went back up to the Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , and to the prisonlike bulk of the Ho Ch'in Silk Company godown , where Peace knew a gateman slave , and then a block further , across a freshet that ran shamelessly across the face of the street , to the Swallow Hostel , a series of courtyards forming four sides of a square around a cobbled inner plaza , with an entrance for palanquins and carriages through an archwayon the south side of Dragon Street . Peace boldly led his barefootparty of country whites into the plaza , past a number of yellow men , dressed in a new fashion of blue pantaloons and black tunics and with buttons on their hats of the nine official grades , walking in and out in pairs and trios , and Peace drew aside the inner-gate porter , a big man perspiring in a braided coat , shabby silk breeches , and muddy cloth boots , and the Porter , accustomed to hiding his emotions , nodded gravely at what Peace proposed , even without a dram . " Indeed , " he said , unwaveringly genteel , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we moved through the city . I was dazzled by Peace ; by the headlong thrust of his obsession , by his passion , by his strongp264sweetness as he proposed the slaughter of all that was not sweet . I loved him , I belonged to him , I was his handmaiden with all my heart ; in short , I was hypnotized by him , as every white he approached was . At the bulge of the afternoon , with the sun at a three-quarters slant , by which time I was footsore , hungry , and thirsty , we found ourselves at the corner of Dragon Street and Eleventh Hutung , and following Peace we started up a deep-rutted cart track that climbed at a meandering angle across an unfenced common onto a hillside gashed and marred with ravines and weedy patches and goat-galled places , sparsely tufted with scrub pine and chinquapin , and brightened in the most improbable way with white trumpets of datura , which practical Solemn said would brew into a kill-a-man tea , and the yellow disks of mayweed , which he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as the track turned , and a big cart came down with its oxen mud-stockinged to the knees and its wheels solid between the spokes with oozing reddish clay , and we came around a lone white oak , I looked up and gasped as I saw , beyond a row of brilliant flags , shining like a carving in ice in the full flood of the westering sun , the most beautiful building , surely , ever built  --  so it seemed to me ; the whited yamen with many curving roofs , cap on cap on cap . Peace was now well ahead of us , striding with powerful steps uphill , almost running , his head lifted to the breathtaking seat of power . Along either side of the great building was a long horse rack , and numerous horses were tied there now , and carriages were standing under the charge of well-dressed slaves , and a pungent steam of horse urine drifted our way ; I hurried , not wanting to be seen in my field-hand clothes . In the distance , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deep gongs , and drums : officials , Solemn said , in the Courtyard of Advisers . We came up on Peace from behind . He was standing on the open ground , near a rude belfry , or gong house , which looked absurdly like the Yen 's dairy , with his legs spread and arms folded , gazing up at the soaring lines of the yamen . A narrow , winding stone stairway led up to the awesome portico with its huge purple columns . Clumps of goats stood ruminating in thep265shade in the gateway near the glowing shafts ; a broadcast of their droppings trailed up the steps . Peace stood there , just so , staring , for a time that seemed endless . Finally , at a grunt from him , and a sudden start away , we tore off to High Thoughts Hill and the patrician end of town , where famous men lived in beautiful houses , and Peace was truly and dangerously drunk now , and it was all Auntie and Solemn and I could do to hush his murderous shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brook Road toward home , and I thought often of my having ridden out that way the first time on the cart with Mink and the agent . There were certain stout men Peace said he wanted to speak to at the villas along the road , and he made an effort to hide his drunkenness when he approached these men  --  but he fed it , too , offering and taking yet more drams . Either the country slaves were more suspicious than the town whites or they sensed Peace 's state . The first three said they would think about what he said  --  ponder it  --  turn it round . Peace was disgusted ; wanted to see no more cowards that day . We went straight home ... . The next morning at Top Man 's second blast on the buffalo horn we started out , men and women alike carrying scythes to cut a meadow 's hay , and we saw that Peace had not yet come out of his room . Auntie told me to hurry and rouse him . I ran to look for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solemn 's wife and two children . He lay asleep on his pallet , loudly snoring . Frantic , I shook his shoulder with my hand , again and again , to try to waken him . I called him , dug my knee in his side , lay on him and rolled on him . The smell of spirits on his breath made me giddy ; my heart was beating wildly . All at once he lunged upward , with a kind of growl , and I slipped aside , and on his knees on the k'ang he ripped his long gown from the throat downward almost to his groin . He pulled me to his chest with a pitiful moan , and he drew me down  --  but he suddenly fell asleep again , groaning and snorting . Then he seemed abruptly to waken , and he saw me through swollen eyelids , and he said , " What are you doing here ? " I leaped up and stood by his k'ang , and I said , " You 're late ,  |p266Peace  . Top Man has blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , my dear handmaiden , Sorek woman , " he said , in his usual formal tone . But he was still drunk . Late in the sixth month came the summer lay-by , and a time of light work after the tobacco had all been transplanted and the hay was in , and the weather came on fine , and word was passed around that there would be a fish feast for all the slaves of all the owners out our way , organized by the slaves themselves . Peace took me fishing alone for the common supply the afternoon before the affair : Auntie was to mend his ripped gown , Harlot had planned to do some wash . As we set out Auntie sallied after us and threw a child 's wornoutshoe at Peace for luck in his fishing ; it struck him on a buttock , and he picked the ragged shoelet up and roared that he would knock her ears together so they would lay side by side like two millet cakes , but she was running toward our quarter and would not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace laughed hard . There were many whites out fishing along Favorable Wind Brook , but we found a fair place by the lower end of a pool . Peace was plain , jovial , playful , and boyish , and I was unusually spirited . Peace warned me not to bad-luck the poles by stepping over them , and he went off to catch some baby grasshoppers . The tall , thin slave Tree , who was fishing a few yards upstream , began to eye me and tease me , and I had a wild warm feeling , as if my loins had drams sloshing around in them , and when Peace came back and sensed what was happening and in good humor called to Tree , " Young man , plow not with my heifer , " I laughed , as Peace himself did . He baited my hook , and I spat on the tiny green machine of a grasshopper and dropped my line into the pool , but I pulled it out often and fished poorly . Whatever Peace needed , I got or did for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , pointing to a round boulder with green skirts at the center of the pool . " That rock is called Etam . That rock is Etam rock , daughter . My rock . " Peace 's eye was suddenly clouded , and I was afraid . But at once Peace resumed his lighthearted manner and cubp267gestures , cuffing at the heads of weeds and , once , tickling me in a grandfatherish , poky way . We caught no fish , and Peace went to the water 's edge and waded half up his shins and pulled up the long shafts of seven reeds , and he came up to me and offered them to me , and said , " Bind me , woman . These are strong . Tie me up . Just try and see . " Something  --  the fierce look in Peace 's eye , his calling me womaninstead of daughter , or perhaps a rushing feeling that I wanted to be with Tree , who was never baffling  --  something undid me , and I was suddenly sobbing , with my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come , daughter , " Peace gently said . " No fish in this pool around Etam . " And we went home . What colors at the fish feast the next afternoon ! The field hands must have borrowed from the house slaves , and the house slaves must have wheedled new wornouts from the mistresses . I had a patterned red silk cape that Auntie had thrown over my shoulders . We paraded in a clearing by the brook in yellow people 's hateful leftover clothes  --  and such graciousness and kindness ! " Evening , White Lotus , sweet child ! " The men bowed . Friends were arm in arm . The day was as fresh and smooth as young Chekiang fan-leaf . Slaves playing pitchpot  --  arching arrows from a distance toward a narrow-necked jar  --  whooped at successes . Everywhere the talk was brisk , argumentative . My mind was whirling , and I could not make head or tail of the absurd chatter . " If a snapping turtle grabs you , he 's never going to let go till it thunders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a night when you have a big moon . " " Tee hee heel " Solemn came up and reported to Peace that Ditcher was going around asking the captains to give him their votes for general in the war when the choosing came . Peace took this calmly . " Let him , " he said ; and then , with a smile , " Ditcher has a powerful frame . " Auntie was carrying a bottle for Peace , and he enlisted several men , Mink among others ( " You 're bent over , but you 're strong " ) , and some came to him , whether for drams or for a chance to fight the yellows I could not have said . " White God in heaven , you 're too old , " Peace said to Ma 's Mule268Foot , one of these volunteers . " You 're too old to fight the yellow people , Mule Foot . Go along now . " " I tell you this , Peace : I can run you up some bullets . I know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You do that , Mule Foot . That would be good . " Peace met one of the slaves with whom he had talked on the way out from Twin Hills . " Have you pondered this business ? " " I have . I 'm going to be in it . " " You have a sword , friend ? " " My master has one , hangs up in the house . I 'm going to get that one when the time comes . " " You 're a good man , " Peace said . Peace was all practicality , and again I had a moment of doubtinghis prophetic side . He gave me the name of each recruit to remember , and he drank hardly at all . The fish was delicious , but there was not nearly enough , and the men began to accuse the women jokingly of having eaten it all . Peace shouted out at the top of his voice , " Captains to meet by Etam rock . Follow me . " He nodded to Auntie , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bank of the pool where he and I had caught no fish . The meeting was at first disorderly ; all the captains had ideas . One said an oath of ' secrecy should be sworn . Another said a man practiced in Lamaistic charms should be found to make conjurationsthat would kill any white who talked about the war . Ch'eng 's Candy said , " We 're going to kill all the yellow males from the cradle up , but we 're going to spare all ages of females . " Sheep Wu said , " Ai , yes , that 's the way it has to be . " There was talk of arms , and Solemn said the men should steal scythes from their masters ' toolhouses and bring them to Yen 's smithy ; he knew how to make swords and pikes of them . During all this Peace held back , silently smiling and nodding . Wang 's Judge said he was going to enlist at Kaifeng market  --  could easily get fifty men there . Candy was to go down as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there was a diviner down there who could warn of difficulties and hazards with jumping sticks . Sheep Wu laid claim to the bargemen on the canal ; another said he would get the copper-pit men ; another , the godown boys ; another , the dikemenders ; another , the slave masons and bricklayers building the new prison . Sheep Wu said he was going all the way to the p| 269province of Anhwei to enlist , he needed money to hire time off from his mistress , and Ditcher said Sheep Wu would also need money for liquor to persuade the Anhwei men , and Candy said they would have to hire a donkey for Sheep Wu to ride down there . Solemn suggested going around to all the slaves at the fish feast gathering coppers for a treasury . " Slow down ! " Peace 's voice was sharp . " Not so fast . We have a decision to make . " " What is that , Peace ? " Sheep Wu , full of his trip to Anhwei , said . " This army is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Remember ! Tell them . " The idea of Tou Mu had terrified me , one night when Smart in the dark smithy had instructed me in a line of ancient yellow nightmares : Shen Kung-pao throwing his own head into the sky from Unicorn Precipice ; the demon Hsu Hao , Emptiness and Devastation , gnawing at the vitals of the Emperor Ming Huang ; the dragon with the head of a camel , eyes of a devil , neck of a snake , belly of a huge cockle , scales of a carp , soles of a tiger , claws of an eagle . It thrilled me to have Peace call on me for my small part in the war . Yet I was shaken by a demand like this , for it made me feel the icy breath of the fanatic in him ; it reminded me of his unbending hardness like that of a hoe head . My voice trembled as I said , " Tou Mu , goddess of the North Star  --  three eyes and eighteen arms , that 's the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear , a pagoda , a dragon 's head , and so on . Eighteen arms . " The brave captains of our army which would set us free , sound and selfless men , suddenly looked as if they might faint or vomit : perhaps not so much at the thought of this horrible female creatureas at Peace 's way of dealing with them . Peace raised one clenched hand and blithely said , " Time to pick a general . One pair of eyes and arms . " Now there was much bickering as to how the selection should be made , and finally Sheep Wu suggested that each man should place a pebble down , according to his choice , on one of a row of flat stones that would represent the several captains . But then we heard Peace 's cavernous voice , saying with a force which simply brushed aside all possibility of contradiction , " You can choose your second-in-command that way if you want . Andp270treasurer , we 'll need a treasurer . As for general , there will be only one general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no question in our minds who our general was . With subdued voices and cautious gestures , the men chose Wang 's Judge as second , and Solemn as treasurer . I was afraid to glance at Ditcher , the pretender ; I heard him muttering and rumbling . Somehow the news that Peace was general swept ahead of us through the fish-feast crowd as we returned into it . " Evening , General , " men and women would respectfully say . A thin man slave of Chi Kuo came up to Peace and said , " I want to fight the yellow people , General , but I ca n't move my hip down here , on this side , I have a crippling pain in my shoulder socket joint , and it seems as if I have ants creeping under my skin down my eating arm .... " And he went on with the catalogue of his miseries , and finally asked Peace if he could help him get well so he might fight . Peace fixed his harsh charismatic eye on the man and grandly said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bone aches . Tie a ribbon of brownsnake skin around your arm where it hurts . What is your name , anyhow ? You can stew down some grease from a marsh hen or a good fat owl and rub it on the joints that hurt . When you put your shoes on out in the field , wear a cash out in the toe of one shoe one day and the other shoe the next . Fried grubs , they make a good ointment for pains like these . You see , these pains come out of the earth . Remember , tell this man about brass from Brother Smart 's book . " I had to struggle to think what Peace wanted , for now that Peace was general it seemed that a thawing change had come over him , and I was carried away by the power of the emotion which , beneath the grandiose manner and the humble remedies , shook Peace 's voice and hands  --  his great concern for a slave in pain , his trying to convey , without saying it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Lord , " I lamely said , " sent fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people , and many people of Israel died . And Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it happened that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he gazed at the serpent of brass , he lived . " p 271All around , men and women gravely nodded . " General , I give you ten thousand thanks , " the man with rheumatism said , bowing and backing away in the yellow manner . Those seventh-month days were panther days , the heat was enough to drown one , and all we did the day long was hoe , hoe , hoe , keeping the tobacco mounds clean and the soil open and friable . After dark one evening Peace took us to the blacksmith shop , the Camp of Dan , where , this night , the only eerie thing was the absence of eeriness . Everything was downright . Solemn had the fire going ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set himself to woodworking the buckthorn handles . Men kept coming in . Ma 's Whippoorwill gave in two scythes , and applied for a captaincy of the foot , but Peace said he stuttered too much to give commands , he could be a donkeyman : Hai ! did not Big Master Ma have a sorrel horse ? That horse would be earmarked for Whippoorwill . Lu 's Gallant , too , wanted to be a captain , but Peace sniffed and said he was too trifling a fellow . At this Gallant stamped up and down the smithy shouting curses . " All right ! " he finally said . " If you will make me a captain I will get you thirty , forty small arms , by Buddha 's belly . By which I mean pistols and matchlocks , it 's the truth ! My master has twentynineright there in the tavern . I know where . " " I will go look at them , " Peace calmly said , and they set the following market day for this project . Various men , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust , the shiny black flakes that scaled away from hot iron when Solemn pounded it ; for that stuff would give strength . Late in the night several captains were present , and in murmuringtones Peace said that in four weeks the business should commence . " Too soon , " Ch'eng 's Candy said ; we would need more arms and better plans . Peace was angry ; his voice bounced among the roof joists . " We have plans ! " Solemn and he would have twelve dozen swords made by then . But , Candy said , we might have five hundred men.  |p272Fine  , Peace said , fine , fine , Chou 's Tinsmith was arranging with Ku the Usher to let us into the yamen to get the arms out that were stored there . To do what ?  --  Candy wanted to know . Well , the plan was to fire the lower part of town , around the Canal Bund , where the godowns were packed with inflammable goods and the houses were poor and thatched ; the yellows would go to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commence the attack . But first we would meet at the bridge on Favorable Wind Brook and send a company to Lu 's tavern to capturesome arms that were hidden there . This arguing made me nervous , and the sight of a forehead  --  it was Sheep Wu 's  --  with drops of sweat gleaming on it increased my trembling . The room was suddenly charged ; the dry air of practicality was gone . The smithy fire was low . The lamp was flickering , its wick smoking . I saw that Smart , his eyes rolling , had taken over . He broke a rain crow 's egg in a rusty basin of water , and he directed each man to wash his face in it , and I wanted to bury myself in the heap of scraps in a corner , because I knew he was going to call in a ghost . And then , yes , it was there , I knew it from the men 's faces , though I could not see it myself because I had not washed my eyes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunts and muttering told me it was the yellow Matriarch . I could only imagine her as a dim figure in the gloom of the grove . Mercy , God  --  a spirit of a living person . Peace was standing , facing her  --  and now his forehead was bathed in sweat . What could I do to drive her away ? I could not run . Sprinkle salt in the fire ? A glass button on a dog 's neck ? Burn an old shoe ? Rice brandy on the ground ? Put a knife that had not touched wood in my hair ? I had nothing on me for exorcism ; I could only die . Peace said in a steady voice , " I am going to kill you , Old Matri-arch . " " Amen , " Smart said , as hollow as a pitcher . Then Peace said , " Get rid of her , Rememberer . " I was paralyzed . I had no idea what to do . " Book words backwards , " Peace moaned in the old language . " Hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and , ' " I began , and at once Ip273saw Peace 's huge arms relaxing . " ' Waters the of face the upon moved God .... " She was gone . A sweet-sour pork roast at the bridge of the brook . A market-day noon at the far edge of the seventh month : too hot to eat the sauced meat . A game of pitchpot under a big mimosa tree . Women are sitting on the bank of the stream , their cotton gowns tucked up around their hips , feet dabbling in the cool water , while some men angle and argue below the bridge , their shouts surely driving off the few puny sunfish and pickerel left in the brook after so many weeks of its having been fished over . In the shade of a willow Mink is at dice with a handful of friends . We stroll . Peace is unusually grand , even for him ; his tunic , soaked , clings to his shoulders ; he half nods to those who half bow to him . Sheep Wu is at Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who has a fair start on being drunk , accosts Peace , and he swaggers and asks when we are going to begin the big business , meaning the war . " You turtle , Joker , " Sheep Wu says , " you look so poor and weak and miserable , you could n't even kill a man . " " Ai ! " Joker squawks . " Do n't be taking me by my appearance . I can do it . Do n't worry , you Shee ' Wu . I can and will kill a yellow man as freely as eat . " " Good , " Peace grimly says , nodding his great thatched head . But here is Ch'eng 's Candy , looking worried . " I know when we begin it , my master and mistress will have to be put to death . " " Among the first , " Peace says . " You know that . " " I have to have one of my lieutenant boys do it for me , Peace . I ca n't do it myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must harden up your heart , " Peace says . " Do n't worry about me , " Candy says , hitching up the cloth cinch at his waist . " When the time comes , I 'll be a knife edge . " " That will be good , Candy , " Peace says ; his voice is mild , but his eyes are furious . Now we are sitting on a grassy bank  --  I am ringed with hairy dock leaves , which I tear along the juicy veins  --  and the responsiblemen are reporting on their enlistments.  |p274First  , Sheep Wu on his trip to Anhwei : " I was down there last market day , to a preaching at the Fragrant Hill of the Three Ox Legs , at a godown there . I have a good account for you , Peace . " But Sheep Wu could not get to the point . " You see , the morning of the preaching I stopped by at the yamen in Pochow , and I came on an old friend , Lin 's Thorn . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help me . On the way I told him what you said , Peace , that we would meet at the brook to kill the yellow people in four weeks ' time . Thorn says to me , I 'm glad to hear it 's going to take place so soon . ' He says to me he 's heartily glad about it . We got down there , and it was still too early for the preaching to commence , so I proposed to old Thorn we could go into a tavern and buy some liquor to melt the men with , when we 'd speak to them about the war , and he agreed to it , and we did , we bought it  --  the money you gave me . There was a lemon-yellow in the tavern , there , she let us in through the slaves ' postern , and we said , two jugs spirits , and she said , Are you smallies going on a spree ? ' " And Thorn , he says , We 're going on the grandest spree the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys be careful , now . ' " And Thorn , he says , We 're going to be most careful , Big Mistress . ' " She could not understand why we laughed almost to bursting , and she shook her head at us . " Thorn bought some malt taffy from a vendor in front of the tavern there , and then we went up to the preaching , and after the preaching we began it . " " Well , Sheep Wu , " Peace said , " and how many ? " " I told you I thought I could get a hundred and twenty men down there , did n't I ? Peace , I stayed three days , and I think we got , Lin 's Thorn and Chang 's Full Bowl and I  --  Full Bowl wanted to be a general , but I told him about that eighteen-arm bitch goddess , that we could only have two arms on our general , so he said he would go by the name or title of Colonel Tall , and he was going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheep Wu ? " " In three days we got near five hundred . " A gasp among the men on the grassy bank . A rising excitement as one after another gives his report . Wang 's Judge  --  enlistments in Twin Hills city , among the slaves building the new prison , and godown boys at the Canal Bund  --  has not brought his list withp275him , but he supposes it is four hundred fifty by now . Fan , the mix , has been as far as Tsining to enlist men , a good number , almost three hundred . Bargemen on the canal , over two hundred . Candy had been to the singing tree . Totals from the tips of the provinces of Shansi and Hopei ; a large band from the Yellow River . I see Peace swelling up with his thrill . " Hai ! " he says , standing up , towering over us . " I have reports on a thousand men in Twin Hills proper . We have nearly five hundred at the copper pits . I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see us in triumph  --  many will join us . We 'll have every slave in Honan  --  and Anhwei and Shansi and Hopei , too , " Peace says , punching a huge fist into a great palm . He is completely carried away . " I already have a cavalry of four hundred donkeymen from right around the brook . Six hundred foot from Ground Squirrel Bridge , four hundred from around the Peach Temple . I tell you , " he says  --  and then a long pause ; absolute silence ; the eternal washing of stones in the stream . " I tell you , my dear brothers , we will have ten thousand men . Now shake hands all around . Give me your hands ! We 'll wade to our knees in blood sooner than fail in this thing . Hayah ! Whoooo ! Give me your hands , my strong boys ! " The men , who have leaped to their feet , are hugging , pounding backs like drums , and crying as they laugh . Off we went again , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Twin Hills , ostensibly to sell the water chestnuts , bean sprouts , cowpeas , and white cabbages we had grown in our spare-time patches outside our quarter , baskets on our arms , trudging this time along Favorable Wind Brook Road , which was dusty under a haze-huge sun that had relentlessly sweated us for a fortnight , with Peace walking ahead leaning one hand lightly on Mink 's shoulder , and the three handmaidens behind . Yes , Peace had taken a fancy to Mink , whose gambling sharpness and twisted back had made him an ideal doubter ; he pricked at the General with skeptical questions that Peace said he needed to keep his toe at the line . One question that Mink occasionally asked bothered me . " General , why ca n't you ever change your mind ? "  |p276The  baskets were heavy , the air was humid . I was in the grip of an unspeakable disgust . The tobacco plants had been attacked by the midsummer glut of hornworms , and for days and days we had been stooping down , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sap-fat , segmented , wiggling creatures with their stubby middle legs like walking teats , their foul arching horns sticking out of their back ends , making them seem waspish , poisonous , and their ugly hard-mouthed button heads which reared up belligerently when they saw a hand approach . Their thick bodies , with pretty patterns repeated all along , writhed under my closed eyelids when I tried to sleep at night , and my dreams were washed in lakes of their spattering juices . I had moments now of imagining that these sphinx worms were squirming on my hands and in my baskets . This  --  to give the yellow man a little brass pipe-bowlful of sucking pleasure ! Oh , I was ready for Peace 's war . Thump , thump . We looked back . Here came a ribbish donkey drawing a cask of prized tobacco , which rolled on its own fatstomachstaves , axletreed on wooden spikes at the center of each end to split saplings that were joined together behind the keg with a hickory withe . On a seat of bamboo lashed athwart the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crab-eyed yellow man , his mouth drawn down in what must have been a long habit of misanthropy . He joggled past us without a nod . Peace knew the man ; said , when the rolling tun was well away , that his name was Yang , a small tobacco farmer from along the branch of the brook above Lu 's tavern . Had a thin time of it . The agents at the Canal Bund would give him short shrift , would most likely cheat him , buying this keg that he had held until out of seasonhoping for a better price . A pitiable case  --  but we would have to kill him , Peace said , because yellow Yang was the owner of three slaves . I suddenly hated this miserable cipher of a yellow farmer . I could see the sharp shoulder blades sticking out of the loathsome bent back as the keg bumped on stones going down a hill ahead . Before the edge of the city we turned down a path until , nearly at the canal , on a high airy rise across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadrangle of the new prison , which was almost finished ; indeed , a few white criminals were already locked away  --  and so was a large supply of arms of the Emperor 's provincialguard.  |p277By  prearrangement Peace met , near the main entrance , Widow Chou 's Heaven-Loved , one of the several hundred slaves who had been hired out to Warlord Sun by their owners to build the fortress . Heaven-Loved , who had been enlisted at Sunken Rock on the Yellow River , was lazing on his back with his head and shoulders against the building , half asleep in the sun . At a touch of Peace 's foot on his leg he jumped up . We walked down into the gulch toward White Heron Hill . For a long stretch nothing at all was said . At last Peace asked , " How are your boys ? Are they ready ? " " I have thirty-two to kill the guards and get us in , " HeavenLovedsaid . He was quiet , earnest , tense , and very young : only a year or so older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by night . " " That should be easy . " " More guards inside . " " We will see to them . Where are the arms ? " " All my squad know the storage hall . They can lead the way . " The sober eyes searched Peace 's face , and almost down to a whisperHeaven-Loved pushed out a single word : " When ? " " The last market-day eve in the month . Listen to me , Captain . You can see the Canal Bund from here . Watch for the fires , wait half an hour after you see them , then begin it . " Heaven-Loved looked like a man who had taken a huge gulp of raw spirits . He who had been all restraint , murmurs , discretion , suddenly threw up his arms and bellowed , " Ayooo ! So soon ! " Peace said , " Hush , son . Do n't begin it unless you get a message the night before ; it will be a confirmation . Do n't begin it anyway unless you see the fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I understand you , Peace . " The mumbling voice , now strapped down with iron bands , added , " Thank the Lord for you , General . " We went into town , to West Dragon Street , which began as a narrow path of used tanbark through a boggy stretch , where lay the tanyards of Chu Yu and Ch'en , and then became a dusty street , and as we walked deeper into the city , and under the market sheds as we sold our wares , every slave we met greeted Peace as " General . " I was astonished at the universal knowledge among the whites of the plan . We climbed to the exquisite yamen up the cart road , and wherep278once there had been deep mud , hard ruts now ran , and puffs of orange dust stirred , and beside the track thistledown blew like a snowstorm . Peace boldly walked between the flags up the portico steps and waved us along behind him , but Mink would not go up ; he was afraid . I looked to Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harlot and I , giggling , followed . In the empty reception hall , where murmurs echoed like distant lowing of cattle , Peace was greeted by Ku the Usher , a nonagenarianwhite freedman who since long ago in the reign of Emperor Yung-t'ai had been caretaker of this yamen . Opposites  --  the huge slave in a field hand 's dirty cotton gown , his feet bare , with his long hair knotted into seven braids , confronting the plump , white-haired , courtly man in black satin breeches and coat , all flaps and skirts , and blue shoes braided with gold , holding a brass ring of keys in one hand and a feather besom in the other . With the manners of a mandarin , Ku the Usher presented himself to Auntie , Harlot , and me , and he led us on what appeared to be a tour for country cousins . " This throne , my dear friends , was formerly a seat of state used by the first Manchu governors . You can see where the emblem of the Mings has been scraped off .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes were as big as brimming wine cups , and she and I kept tittering in our terror of being surprised in these echoing stone vaults by a yellow man . Ku treated Peace with what seemed to me a faint contempt . At last we came to a room where , before unlocking the door , Ku looked both ways , and listened . A key rattled , the door swung back , and in the dim light we saw many , many conical stacks of snaphaunce muskets . Peace 's eyes ! Ku quickly drew the door to , and locked it , and in a whisper that rebounded from the walls he spoke to Peace , his white face suddenlycontorted from that of a benign old statesman into a twisting , snarling grimace : " I 'm glad to do it , General . The night itself , you 'll find me near the governors ' chair , and I 'll give you the key to the magazine by my own hand , and I hope you slaughter them every last one , General , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bless you , bless you . " The last shred of dignity was gone ; the old man began to blubber . We hurried away , leaving him weeping in the dark hall over his years of kowtowing to yellow men.  |p279Now  we went to the postern gate of a public tavern down in the town , the Siskin Bird , and bought a bottle of spirits . In our coolie rags and bare feet we strolled along the yellow people 's fashionable promenade , on an elevated bank of the canal shaded by willows , to the Scholars ' Garden , where Peace said he was to meet Reed-Mat Su , a free white man who had been enlistingamong the Twin Hills slaves ; he was employed in the garden 's entertainments . Peace led us boldly down the sloping parade ground . We circled the many-roofed temples and came on the far side to a breathtaking view of a series of gardens running in terraces down to the canal , which here was artificially broad and contained several islands feathery with sycamores . Hundreds of yellows in leisure-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nibbled at almond cakes and persimmons . We were intimidated and ducked behind some huge cork-spindle bushes and took each a heavy pull at the bottle ; then , hot-throated , we walked daintily on bubbles of self-importance straight down to the show ring . There was Reed-Mat Su , in yellow tights and a puffy-shouldered jacket , skipping about on errands  --  anchoring the posts for the slack-rope dancers , putting out colored tubs for the tame bears to posture upon . Reed-Mat was himself part of the show : an embodiment of all that the masters believed white men to be , for he stumbled and played stupid , shook his head over the simplest of duties , shuffled lazily , kept his jaw hanging slack , fawned in front of the equestrian acrobats , white men who were naked except for pink codpieces tied on with twisted cloths , and made secretive obscene gestures behind their bare rumps . He was an artist of self-abasement ; we , too , laughed at him in helpless fury . We stood in a good-sized pool of avoidance : the long-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . There were no other slaves in sight . The pink-pricked bareback riders leaped onto the heaving white hips of the horses going round and round and did somersaults in the air . Reed-Mat came to us . " You ca n't come here , " he said between his teeth to Peace . " We are already here , " Peace said . " You are going to get me in trouble . " " You turtle , " Peace said . " I ca n't talk to you now . "  | " Do not talk , son . Give me the list . " " Here ? " " Do you have it ? " " I have it . But not here . What if they took it off us ? " " Pll kill any man that touches me . " Peace 's voice was rising . Mink knocked a fist on Peace 's chest , as if asking to enter . " Notyou talking , " he said . " The bottle talking . " At this Peace suddenly became reasonable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , in the slaves ' enclosure , after the magician 's act . " The riders had finished . The showmaster , a yellow man in oldfashionedwarrior costume , with mustaches dripping in narrow lines on either side of his mouth , and holding a long-tongued whip , came stamping over to us . " Send that garbage away from here , " he furiously said to Reed-Mat . " I am just shooing them , " Reed-Mat said . " I will give you ten breaths ' time , " the showmaster said to Peace . " Or this . " He raised the whip . Peace was abruptly servile , apologetic , stupid , slow , honeyed ; he spoke with the thickest of country accents  --  Reed-Mat Su 's caricature in true life , it seemed . And this served the purpose . We retreated . The showmaster and Su exchanged glances and broke into guffaws . We went to the slaves ' yard , fenced in with palings to hide the waiting smallies from the sight of the carefree yellows in the gardens . Here were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , and they gathered about Peace , who looked like a rough , stinking cowherd beside them , and they gravely shook him by the hand , one by one , and called him " General . " At last Reed-Mat Su came and gave us his list : Auntie tucked it in her bosom , where the bottle was already warmly cradled , supported by her crossed arms . On the road out to Yen 's we fell in with a company of men on their way home from a day 's pass in town . They were mostly drunk . One had a basket of plums , and Peace reached down and took one . A drunken slave , who had said he was from Anhwei , and who did not know Peace , belligerently asked , " What business have you snatching the man 's plum ? " " We are dear friends , son . He can spare me a plum . He is one of my society . " But the Anhwei man had an argument in his craw . He graspedp281Peace 's shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , now ? " " A society , " Peace said with a profound meekness , " to kill the yellow people . He and I , and all these men , we are bound under a pledge to fight the yellow people until we die , for our freedom  --  and yours , too . " " O Lord , have mercy , " the drunk from Anhwei said , falling to his knees . " You the General ? " Like Ku the Usher earlier in the day , this man broke into sobs . Our young master Yen was away , over in **28;5846;TOOLONG , formally courting a girl his mother had chosen for him , and a secret meeting was called . The meeting that night was pervaded with a sense of Mink . The crookback was not in the smithy himself , but the dark room was filled to its sooty peak  --  or so it seemed to me  --  with his perverse , heavy indifference , and with that appalling stiffness of Peace 's that Mink kept poking at : his unwillingness , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if need might be . Peace and his " brothers , " Smart and Solemn , were the only ones who seemed not to have lost their inner fire . Someone asked , " Are there enough arms ? " Wang 's Judge said he had been trying to make crossbows , but this was the season for topping the tobacco plants , he was a topper , from dawn to dark he was out there pinching back the flower buds and the stems of the tobacco plants to the proper number of leaves , and pulling out the sucker growths , and he simply did not have fingers or forearms left for night work on the crossbows ; he had brought eighteen over this night , the best he could do . Ch'eng 's Candy said he was ready with his pistol , but it was in need of repair ; could Solemn fix it ? " Give it to me , indeed I will , " Solemn said , but the feeling in the room was down . Then there was a bad question from Ditcher : Did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good old man from over in West-of-the-Mountains Province , " Peace said , " who was at the siege of Taiyuan . He has promised to come over and meet me at the brook when we beginp282it . He is going to advise me . Sheep Wu , you went over there enlisting , you met him , I suppose . " But at first Sheep Wu was silent . " I 'm afraid they may find us out before we begin it , " he then suddenly said . " There were two men down in Pochow , I forget their names , they said they did not like it , they would communicate with a master down there . Well , Lin 's Runner and some others pursued them , had the intention to put them to death with a hog knife in the slave quarters , teach all the others a lesson , but those two were all smiles when they were cornered , never had any idea of communicating  --  so they said  --  and Runner let them off . It 's the truth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have house servants all over that know about the war , " Ch'eng 's Candy said . " And slaveherds . And women . A man told me your own slaveherd Top Man knows all about it . Some idiot of a slave tried to enlist him . " " House servants , that 's bad , " Ditcher said . Then Fan , the mix , asked in a complaining tone , " How are we supposed to do it , Peace ? What 's the whole plan ? " " You know your orders , " Peace said . " I know what I am supposed to do , but you never told your captains the whole war . " " Why , here it is , then . " And here it was : Three thousand slave soldiers , foot and donkey , were going to meet at the bridge of Favorable Wind Brook the following market-day eve , at midnight . Divided into three columns , whose officers had already been designated , these were all to march on Twin Hills in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staves , were to head for the new prison and the yamen . A party of fifty , under the warehouseboy , Mandarin King , was to set fire to the godowns and houses in the district of the Canal Bund , and at the sight of the fires , Widow Chou 's Heaven-Loved at the penitentiary would hand out arms to the right wing , and Ku the Usher at the yamen to the left wing . The center column , armed with scythe-swords , scythepikes , pistols , and muskets , would meanwhile descend on the town by way of the tanbark paths into West Dragon Street and begin the slaughter . The city slaves would convene with the left and right columns . Every unit was ready . A blockade would be thrown across the canal bridge . A thorough massacre , street by street , would be carried out after dawn . Then proclamations would be issued calling all friends of humanity to our standard , andp283in a week we would have fifty thousand . Ai ! The capture of Tsinan was already planned ; a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We aimed to have Honan , Shansi , and Anhwei in a month ! But the sooty cavern of the smithy was dead . No one cheered or hugged or wept . " I 'll show you our standard , " Peace said , and he went into a corner and fetched a shredded old banner that had belonged , he told us , to a secret society on Peach Mountain Island during the uprising there : a purple square with gold fringe . I felt torn . I was shocked by the apathy of these trusted officers ; yet the iron automatism of Peace , his stiff way of telling of his set plan , troubled me even more . Peace seemed inwardly deaf ; nothing these men said reached him . Wang 's Judge said , " I 'm not ready in my mind . I say wait . I say let 's delay . " What a frightening calm on Peace 's face ! " We scarce can wait , " Solemn said , in his dull , practical voice , almost as if it did not matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponement . " I heard at a preaching that in the old days , when Pharaoh held the people down , so their backs were chafed , they were finally freed away from him by the power of God , and Moses led them away . But look  --  God gave him an angel to guide him . I can see nothing of that kind here , Peace . I have seen no angel . Do you have a sign ? " Peace 's eyes were moving from face to face . It was a sign they wanted , but Smart , in the same leaden voice as Solemn had used , tried reason . He said that the summer was almost over , the thing must be done before it got too cold ; that the Emperor 's warlords had stood down the provincial militias for the season , and this was why all the arms were propped in little haystacks in the new prison and the yamen  --  and what if the yellows should call the troops out again ? Then I saw the jawbone in Peace 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smart 's voice moved at a faster pace . " Sheep Wu , speaking of angels , I saw in my book where it says , Delay breeds danger . ' And where it says , Worship God and you shall have peace in all the land . ' Where it says , Five of you shall conquer an hundred , and an hundred a thousand of thine enemies . ' " The roar that now broke from Peace 's lips was one of suchp284agony that I wanted to run , or hide , or die , and the reason it terrified me so much was that it released in me an impulse to violence which I did not feel I could control . " I will not wait ! " he shouted . " Rather than bear any longer what I 've borne , I 'll turn out alone and fight with this . . . this stick in my hand ! " He shook the jawbone high above his head . But Wang 's Judge said in a dead level voice , " It would be better on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a market day . Why start the day before a market day ? " Peace bellowed , " We will go ahead ! We will go ahead ! Everyone has his orders ! Do as I say ! " I felt the heavy care-naught spirit of the crookback lurking in the room . The men were silent and gloomy . The morning of the day of the beginning of the war was sullen . A solid dry-cloud cover of an extraordinary darkness moved , or appeared to skid , too fast ( for there was little wind on the ground ) low across our sky , almost brushing the limp treetops , it seemed . The air was oppressive , hot , electric , still , like the fur of a huge dark cat waiting to pounce . My eyes were sticky , the cap of my head felt heavy , I was dull and uneasy . I had slept scarcely at all . We had been up late at the blacksmith shop , dispatching messages to Widow Chou 's Heaven-Loved , Ku the Usher , Mandarin King , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ; counting weapons and assigning them to captains ; making some last desperate prayers to the whiteskinnedGod . All of us in the dark room except Peace had been tense and irritable ; he had maintained his astonishing meekness and sweetness , which , exuding like a fragrance from his gigantic , muscular body , seemed to emphasize , to multiply in our minds almost beyond belief , the impression of his inner strength  --  and of his immovable stubbornness , too . Peace had at last sent us all to bed and had stayed in the smithy alone , to meditate and pray , he said . I had lain down naked and thrashed on my straw mat all the hot night ; if I dipped into sleep it was only to waken twitching andp285bathed in sweat . I was not afraid of dying ; no , it was more shameful  --  Iwas afraid of audacity . This was the deepest horror of having been a slave : I had lost the capacity for impudence , I was willing to let life happen to me . A hundred times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , face to face with the master 's mother , who was defenseless , and I would raise my arm , and she would look sternly at me , as if from behind a pane of glass far too thick for my blade to smash , and the strength would trickle down out of my arm , and the arm would go flaccid , and it would fall , and the sword would clatter on the floor , and I would drop to my knees and beg for forgiveness , forgiveness . Was I asleep ? Was I awake ? Over and over the picture repeated itself , until my self-loathing was so profound that I had to sit up in bed to stop my nausea and dizziness . What a relief the mournful squall of the slaveherd 's buffalo horn had been ! Upon hearing its first flatulent moan I had leaped to my feet  --  only to find that Auntie and Harlot had already started up like a pair of deer . " Guh ! What a witch night ! " Auntie groaned , and all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nest of darkness had been some kind of bad joke . With the second deep bleat of the horn fear swept back into my body , as I thought of our worried talk at the smithy the night before about our slaveherd . Top Man had indeed been enlisted by some fool from another place , and he had been asking questions . Some thought that he wanted ferociously to be with us  --  that he hated himself so bitterly for being the master 's and the overseer 's tongue and eyes , and rod hand , too  --  that he would be the very one to kill those two yellows ; others thought that he loved his measly power too much to jeopardize it , and that he might inform . " Stay away from Top Man , " Peace had finally ordered . " Tell the fellow not a word , do you hear ? " I ran all the way to the blacksmith shop to make sure that Peace had heard the horn . My breathing came hard , the clouds pressed so low that I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Smart and two captains from other farms who had bought their hire for the day were already at the smithy ; and also a city slave , Ma 's Brass . A messenger , as he said , from a captain of foot in town , Brass had come for last-minute instructions.  |p286Solemn  was asking Brass as I entered whether , on his way out from the city in the night , he had seen any provincial guardsmen . " Yes , a squad of six drinking at Lii 's tavern . " " Did they have horses ? " " Yes , inferior ponies . " " But not paying mind to their duties ? " " It was late , awfully late , Solemn . Nearly morning . " " True . " Peace calmly said , " Do n't fret , Solemn . We 'll do away with all of them . " Brass 's eyes were big ; I dare say he had never seen General Peace before . " The only worry , " Solemn said , " is if they double the guard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No matter what you say , " Peace said , " our plans are so far advancedthat we are compelled to go ahead , even if they find us out . ... You have four swords to finish , Solemn . " " They 'll be done , " Solemn irritably said . " I told Overseer Li I had hoops to do today , and he said to go ahead . " Solemn stooped to build a fire ; he angrily clattered the grate . Brass left , and I was able at last to say that the second horn had been blown . " I am coming , dear handmaiden , " Peace gently said . " This will be our last day in the fields  --  think of that , child . " But what a long day ! It was a hoeing day . Such a miserable claw is a hoe . Head down , back bent , arms forever pulling the same way ; broad snout strikes a stone , and the jar of the unyielding handle runs all the way through to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crut , crut , crut , the blade chips away at the morning , at the hump of the day 's heat , at the long afternoon , at the slanting shadows , crut . . . crut ... crut . . . crut ... crut .. . We tried to sing ourselves along , but Harlot could not find the right hymn ; we dared not be mournful , we were agitated and out of tune . I felt a kind of numbness all day long , perhaps from having slept such shallow naps the night before . Peace worked as on any other day  --  steady , patient , strong , enduring . His eyes were veiled . I heard him humming once when there was no gang hymn going . The dark plate of cloud semed to push down lower and lower ;  |p287the  wind rose from the direction of the Yellow River until the woodlots hushed at us , and the broad leaves of Chekiang fan-leaf , in the field where I was working , began to bow and clap . But the wind was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's bad breath . Mink talked away as if it were an ordinary day , until we were all annoyed with him and tried to dam him up , but he kept overflowingwhere we least expected ; he did not care . Overseer Li came by . I thought : You are going to die tonight , we are going to kill you . He walked close to my task , and I hoed hard , because even though I wanted him dead I also wanted to please him . Yes , I would have this one last chance to show that I was a good worker . When he had passed , not even having looked at me , I was humiliated , furious with myself , and therefore quite at peace with the idea of killing this yellow man , and every other one . My master . As the overseer walked away , I felt a surge of blind hatred for Yen the son ; I had seen the young owner , over the months , not more than six or eight times  --  only once close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise crossing a field on horsebackat a distance , or on a round of inspection with Li . He used my existence but denied it . He did not know me at all . At our eating pause Top Man came to Peace and in a quiet voice said , " Will you tell me your plan , friend ? " Peace turned vacant eyes on the slaveherd . " What plan was that , friend ? " Giving back " friend " for " friend , " he set Top Man off his balance . " I heard you were ready to begin it . " " Begin what , Top Man ? You mean , begin the new pigpen in the back of Solemn 's room ? " " You know what I mean . " " I am an ignorant hand , Top Man . I do not know what you mean . Be a kind man and tell me . " This was obviously a dare . " I mean , " Top Man said , nearly weeping with rage , " the thing you mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know . " " I am at a loss . Brother Smart , you have a better head than I. Do you know what this mystery of Top Man 's is ? " " Why , I ca n't fathom it , " Smart said . " I can be as good as any of them , " Top Man said.  | " You are a fine slaveherd . As slaveherds go , you are excellent . " " I mean the other . For what you intend to do . " " Top Man , you 're a riddle . I give up to you . I can not puzzle out what you mean . " A sudden gust blew at Peace 's hair ; the seven queues shook . " I mean that I hate them just as you do . " " Them ' ? What is that , Top Man ? Hornworms ? " " I could have told them . I have known for weeks . I could have informed . " " I believe that . Anything could have come to pass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wind Brook Swamp any night , Top Man . A slave hardly knows what to expect these days . " " You could be making a mistake , " Top Man said . " My soul , I think I could . I know I could . My body is big , Top Man , it 's as big as a maize crib , it could hold a whole harvest of error . I make no claim to being without error . I 'm full of it , Top Man . My bones ache with it . I 'm a very mistaken man . Everyone knows that . But I swear I can not see what you are trying to say to me . " " Ayah , Peace , you turtle , " Top Man said . " I 've never seen you bambooed . I 'm tempted today . " " Today 's your best and last chance , " Peace said , pushing out his chest and advancing toward the slaveherd . Top Man clutched his horn , which was slung over his shoulder on a length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blast , the mournfulness of which was enough to drag out the spirits of the dead in the daytime . " All right , " he hoarsely shouted , and I thought there were tears in the red rims of his eyes . " Hoe out ! Finish your tasks and you go in . Brisk now , you hands . Hoe out ! Hoe out ! " Crut . . . crut . . . crut ... the day was so long ! Late in the afternoon there sounded a single , deep , distant rumble . Every hoe hand 's head came up ; eyes darted to eyes . My heart began to pound  --  at the edge of my mind a distorted picture of the clumps of slaves praying on the deck of the East Garden for a cataclysmic storm , the yellow sailors grinning down on our nakedness ... . For the first time all day , after that faraway growl , Peacep 289showed signs of feeling . He chopped harder with his hoe , his locks bounced , his eyes were  --  afraid ! Ayah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each hand completed his task , which was marked out with stakes , he was excused ; some , who finished early , helped others to get theirs done , and we walked back to the quarter in groups of half a dozen at a time , at about an hour before dark . Peace had gone ahead of the group with which I was working in one corner of the field , and I felt uneasy at his going off without Harlot and me in train  --  Auntie was with the children in the slaves ' compound . He had walked off alone . When we came into the street of the quarter , we saw Peace out in it , chopping at the hog-wallow earth with an axe . At each stroke he would hop to one side , so the next cut in the ground would form a cross with the last . There was a wildness about his looks that frightened me even though I saw at once that he was acting out one of our superstitions  --  driving the threatening storm away with a pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . At each stroke , as he raised the axe head , Peace lifted himself on tiptoes and then brought the blade down with the ferocity of one splitting fire logs of twisted locust  --  throwing far more strength into the work of chopping the ground than it seemed to need . He is already killing , I thought , hup , kill , hup , kill , hup , kill . So for the first time I faced the real nature of the slaughter that was so soon to begin : that it would not be an abstract holocaust but rather a series of blows on separate human bodies , one by one . I heard Peace 's deep grunts as the strokes went home , and then I heard two men in the circle of onlookers grunting in unison with Peace , and I saw that their lips , like Peace 's , drew back in agony at each frightful crash of the flying iron wedge . I was torn apart . I was terrified of the idea that the killing , once started , might not stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself felt , in my neck , under the gag of surprise and horror , beginnings of sharp , sweet exclamations . Hah ! There ! Our turn ! Hoo ! At last ! There ! . . . The axe bite pulled away , and two big chips of earth crust flipped on their backs , and Peace swung the helve backward and upward , stretching his legs and torso and arms until the head of the tool was higher than the huts  --  and at that moment there came a single , short , flat crack of thunder.  |p290The  axe was already on the way down , but the force was out of the blow . Before the thud of the head in the ground , a pelting of enormous drops of rain began . I saw the axe fall out of Peace 's hands , and he raised and spread his arms in a great Y. Waves of fearful disbelief washed across his face . There ensued , for me , a moment of shock  --  not because the raindrops had been able to march so thuddingly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Peace , in whom I had reposedso much hope , did not seem able to believe that our deity might abandon us . I myself had felt since early morning that our God was looking the other way ; all day I had wanted Peace to change the plan while knowing that he would not , could not . Peace seemed now as if he wanted to split all humanity , of whatever color , with the axe . He stooped for the handle and redoubled his efforts . The onlookersscurried for cover and watched him from doorways . The flakes of earth that he had shived up turned dark , then soft , and soon he was standing in mud hacking at mud . But there seemed to be no more thunder , and the huge splats of the first downpour gave way to smaller and smaller drops , until the shower seemed virtually over , and Peace , his back glistening , runnels of water streaming out of his hair down his face , stood away , axe handle at hip , and looked at the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rain , however , did not stop , but continued first as a drizzle ; gradually the wind , which had fallen still during that first loud spattering , increased , and the raindrops drove slantwise harder and harder as darkness fell . The rendezvous at the bridge had been set for midnight , and I now hoped that the rain would prove to be only a prolonged shower , and would abate , for though I was prepared to risk my very life  --  insofar as I understood that concept  --  it was neverthelesshard to think of risking my life and being wet , chilly , and miserable , too ! Just at dusk the sky broke down on us . There was enough light left to see the frightful black swirling edge of the new torment , pressing low on the terrain , coming swiftly from the river 's direction , yet it was dark enough so that when the lightning came , in a hundred fitful licks from cloud top291cloud and down to trees all around us , we were shattered by the light even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hid my face but could not escape the bombardment . I felt that it was seeking me out  --  and then I thought : No ! It is after Peace . He is the one who brought this on us . Their magic is stronger than his . God 's crosses did n't break the storm . Peace refused to postpone . Mink was right : Peace ca n't change his mind . The masters ' yellow gods know the plan , and our God with a white skin is not strong enough , or cares too little for us ; or perhaps it is His will that we should remain subservient , we should accept our tired backs , we should be , like His son , humble and forgiving . God has abandoned Peace because Peace is an upstart . Peace really has wanted to overthrow , not our masters , but our God Himself . He was trying to chop God with the axe . And this is why Peace can not change his mind : He aspires to omnipotence . He wants to make and stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The thunder pounded these thoughts into me . The wind was soon at a gale , and a wooden shutter at our window banged back and forth as if trying to flee , and when it crashed open sheets of water poured in at the square hole ; when it flapped shut the deluge abruptly stopped . I heard Auntie weeping . She had lit a lantern ; it flickered a feeble counterpoint to the almost continuous lightning . Peace came roaring into our room . He wanted to leave . He shouted that he was ready . I saw him for an instant in the sputtering light of our lantern , then suddenly he was bathed to the seat of every pore by a flash so close at hand that the sharp crackle of sound , riding the brilliance , seemed to come from him . He was dressed in his ordinary work clothes , and he had tied around his forehead a fillet of red flannel , to keep his hair from plastering down on his face , and in his hand he held his huge jawbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightning . His lips were drawn back in the grimace-smile of his chopping in the earth . Then the lantern blew out , the lightning stopped for a few moments , and there was only his voice . " Come , daughters ! Call out the people . Time to leave . " " In this ? " Auntie said . Her voice itself seemed to cringe . " We have to get out there . My men are coming . " " Not till midnight , Peace . The storm could pass . " " The storm is safest . They will never see us. "  | " How are you going to see your own soldiers ? " Again , as he had at the smithy the night of the last meeting , Peace lost control . " OBEY ME , you turtle women , " he shouted . We are beaten , I thought then , we have no chance . If God were in him , he would not shout like that . He is incapable of changing the plan in the slightest detail . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Peace is not godlike enough . " Yes , Peace , " Auntie said , but her voice had a hair-raising too careful tone , as if she were speaking to one of them , saying , " Yes , Big Master . " " Go from room to room and call out the men , " Peace shouted over the wind . " Solemn has a storm lantern . Light it in the cabin there and then meet me at the big-house end of the quarter . " " Yes , Peace . " I was drenched before I had run two steps . Going into the wind and rain I could hardly breathe , and I had to turn my head aside and gulp at the air . At each cabin , though I spoke with all the force I could manage , the men were astounded that Peace wanted to go out in the storm . As I ran from door to door , lightning seemed to trip me ; each time it winked I would fall to my knees and cover my ears with my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same . The night , between flashes , was utterly black . Some cabins had lamps going . Many of the women were weeping , and when I appeared with Peace 's unbending summons , the wails soared , and the wives threw their arms around their husbands ' necks , and the men , tearing themselves out of the hysterical embraces , cursed both their women and Peace . We met at the head of the street , where Peace , insisting on a count , found that four men had refused to leave their cabins . Bellowing , Peace went after them himself . Then we set off roundabout through the fields for the smithy , to get our weapons . The raindrops were coming so hard on the hurricane wind that they seemed to have been maliciously hurled , like handfuls of pebbles . We groped our way on foul footing , leaning into the wind . Now and then a fork of lightning would reveal the party in an instant 's light-frozen tableau : tentative steps , wet clinging clothes , a strong man straining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forehead , a crookback bent to the gale , two men with arms about each other , a mule jawbone gleaming shoulder-high  --  then total blackness , save for what seemed a globe of solid water glis/tening around the muffled storm lantern in Auntie 's hand ; and a roar of drops hitting the ground and of wind lashing the trees . We crowded into the smithy , where , though the whole shed shook in the wind and the rain drummed on the roof , it seemed we had found everlasting calm ; but Solemn and Tree had a violent argument over the allotment of swords and pikes to our Yen slaves , and before long we were out in the storm again . Peace left Solemn at the shop to hand out arms to other contingents as they arrived . If possible , the downpour was more vicious than ever . We made our way along the Brook Road as far as the bridge . I thought we would be the only ones there that night , our dozen men and three women , but soon , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs , then in handfuls , then in scores , then in companies . The hooded lamp was the only light ; the storm 's flashes were less frequent now , though the rain and wind continued hard . Faces , streaming with water , swam into the small effulgence of the lamp , and now and then a scythe-sword glinted . I heard Mink , his nihilism as vigorous as ever , shout in Peace 's face with a wild glee , " Those fires at the Canal Bund are never going to burn . " " Hah ! " Peace shouted . " The tobacco will burn . There 's wood like tinder inside the godowns . " He pushed Mink away with the side of his hand . The brook was rising . Men were milling about in great disorder . Donkeys brayed at the thunder ; in the lightning their huge eyes took fire , their dark noses glistened , their manes looked like blowingsmoke . A frantic man was pushed forward into the lamplight . He had come from Twin Hills , having run all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brass and True , Ma 's slaves , he said , had informed ! They had shut themselves in their master 's office and told him everything , and Ma had warned his cousin Ma out here on the Brook Road and had alerted Warlord Sun at the yamen . Sun had posted thirty guardsmen at the new prison , and fifteen at the yamen gate , and he was sending horsemen out along the Brook Road . Peace held the jawbone high and shook it and shouted , " TOO LATE ! They are too late ! We have already started the thing . " But this cry , which must have been meant to rally the wavering ,  |p294was  a terrible moan , a bursting of frustration and inflexibility in Peace 's massive chest . I knew we were lost ; I hugged Harlot and wept , and I could hear her sobs , too . I felt the ceaseless rain as a heavy , clammy texture weighing on me , like a wet shawl on my shoulders . By now the brook was rising with alarming speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistening beads of rain , I could see its pocked black surface licking at the timbers of the bridge . Still men gathered . Smart called out that we had passed the count of a thousand . The confusion was frightful , and men argued in screams . Donkeys and mules tossed their heads . Someone shouted that we had better leave , the bridge would soon be covered . But Peace called out that the plan had been made , we could not abandon it , some of his captains were still on their way , the old man from West-of-the-Mountains who had been at the siege of Taiyuan had not arrived yet . No ! No ! We must wait ! Now the water was over the level of the bridgeway . Some city slaves , evidently fearful of being cut off , made a dash for the bridge , and then there was a surge . I heard the railings of the bridge cracking , and there were screams and splashes in the darkness . I heard  --  I was sure I heard  --  Mink laughing . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , starting off every which way , cursing , howling , and shoutinginto the swirls of wind . I was seized , as if by a group of hands at my shoulders , by a feeling of helplessness , a sense that I no longer had any control over where and how my own feet would be planted on the ground , to say nothing of my destiny . Then I realized what was happening : A surge of the tight-packed mob around us was bodily carrying me  --  and Peace , and our whole group  --  away from the roadway and along the brookside . There was sloping leaf mold underfoot . I was indeed helpless and might well be stampeded into the stream . Then I heard Peace begin to shout , " O God , God , God , where are You ? White God , where are You ? " I wanted to take up this cry , for I had very strongly the feeling of having been abandoned by Him . Why do n't You help us ? Ca n't You help us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could not have said whether Peace was roaring these questions or whether they were reverberating ,  |p295hollow  and wind-rushed , in my own head . It occurred to me that Peace might have experienced , as I had , that slipping sensation , that helplessness of being heaved over the loam footing by the pressure of the crowd which had lost its mind in the storm . Such helplessness would be the one thing an omnipotent being simply could not stand . Yes , I did hear Peace shouting , his speech soundingthick and trembling as it was torn from his mouth by the wind . The bridge washed away with terrible creakings and splittings . I wondered for a moment if all this could really be happening to me . For what was I being punished ? I heard the sopping tatters of Peace 's shouts  --  some sort of raving about the fountains of the great deep and the windows of heaven . . . the rain was on the earth and the water prevailed exceedingly . ... Smart 's dark book ! I sensed the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were recoiling from the sounds they heard coming from Peace 's mouth , and were scattering , getting away as fast as they could . Had they found Peace out ? Should I run ? The storm seemed to blow away snatches of the hollow chanting that was now coming from Peace 's throat , and to magnify words here and there : " . . . FIFTEEN cubits . . . waters prevailed , and all flesh DIED ... fowl , and of cattle , and of beast ... CREEPING THING THAT CREEPETH . . . in whose nostrils was the BREATH Oflife .. . " I felt such a bitter sadness . All my hopes of all this time ! I thought I heard a bewilderment in Peace 's outcries , as if he were losing his sense of power and could not understand why . " GOD ! GOD ! WHERE ARE YOU ? " The crowd was rapidly breakingup . I had no idea where the men were going  --  perhaps to hide ( from whom ? from the yellows ? from Peace ? ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans by Brass and True , and it seemed to me for a moment that perhaps it was their unthinkable treachery rather than the storm that had addled and routed Peace and all his army . Peace was chattering about killing the yellow Matriarch ; he was moving along the brook , and I followed . I was strongly affected by a need to be obedient . Somehow Peace , Auntie , Harlot , and I drifted off by ourselves and were crashing through a thicket . " Every living substance was DESTROYED on the face of the ground ... " We were at the big house ; in a flash I saw it looming there , asleep in the typhoon under the walnut trees . But Peace did not approach the gate , and I felt a wind-gust of relief , for my own weak aim to kill had vanished long since . I wanted to hide ; I was afraid of being caught . Peace led usp296away . I felt the mud of tobacco fields under my feet . It now seemed to me that God had abandoned us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fend off a storm sent by the yellows ' deities , but rather had decamped from within each of us , from our natures , from our worthless white souls . Ai , yes , I felt godlessly worthless . ... And ahead of me , indeed , I heard Peace shouting self-abasement . No longer the Flood ; he was talking about himself  --  the final loss of his secretly named inner genie , the powerful hero of the war that in the end had simply been rained out . "  --  is not my name . I am  --  O God !  --  not strong . I CAN NOT take up the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and the bar and carry them up the hill before Hebron the green withes GOD GOD GOD they 're tying me tight they have me pinned to the beam by the web on my locks RAZOR RAZOR  --  my hair ! . . . I 'm weak , weak , blind , blind . Fetters of brass , GOD , they 've harnessed me  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in deep woods . The despair in Peace 's voice was worse than thunder : I had my hands over my ears as we moved , but nevertheless I heard him reach the bottom of the well of his hopelessness when he bellowed three times , in an agony of uttermost surrender , the name of his hero-self so long unspoken : " SAMSON ! SAMSON ! SAMSON ! " Then he fell sobbing to the soaked earth . At the first thinning of the night we wakened . The rain had stopped , and our four bodies were wrapped in a sort of ball on a bed of leaf mold in the forest  --  we three women had curled close about Peace , nesting him in what warmth we had left . The trees , black figurations against the gray , were motionless above us , and the woods around us were as yet birdless , sleeping , silent  --  until Auntie began to cry with a small girl 's catching whimper . Peace lifted an arm and drew Auntie into an embrace . " It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . In a few moments he sat up , looked about us , and said , " I had better move along now . I want you girls to go back to the quarter , get in there before Top Man 's horn . " No more talk of handmaidens , daughters . " We are going to see you safe , Peace , " Auntie said , " and no argument . It 's market day . "  |p297Peace  accepted that . " Forgot about market day , " he said . It was not yet really light . He said that the other side of Twin Hills was the place to be , they would never look for him on the far side of Twin Hills . We could not tell yet from the sky where the east was . A scythe-pike lay on the ground ; Harlot thought she might have been carrying it during the storm . Peace took it up . The mule jawbone was half buried under old leaves . He did not touch it . There was moss on one side of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  northward toward the river , rather than eastward as I had expected . We ran across some unfamiliar tobacco fields  --  " Should be Wang 's , " Peace said  --  risking the open ground because it was still half light and we thought no one would be awake anywhere yet . In woods beyond the fields , we came across two slaves sleeping on the ground , who were wakened by our footsteps . One of them jumped up and said , " Where are you going , Peace ? Where should we go ? " No more " General . " Peace said he would go northward for a day or two and then loop around toward East-of-the-Mountains . " Can we go with you ? " It would be better , Peace said , not to make up into a party . We moved along , and when we crossed a swollen drainage ditch I realized why we were not going straight toward the city : there would be no way yet of getting over the flooding brook , and Peace , indeed , soon said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tied up in fair numbers against the pilings of most of the tobacco growers ' landings along the river . That , in due course , we did , and for an hour we poled ourselves and floated down the swollen river , and then , as it grew full light under dry clouds that were now scudding seaward , we abandoned the sampan on the far bank of the river and went into the forests there . Peace , still carrying the lance , was quiet , soft-voiced , noncommittal . Now and then there came into his eyes a flicker , just a flicker , of a dreamy speculative look ; he blinked it quickly out , but I thought I would die of pain in my heart at the sight of those momentary , shuttered abstractions . I felt , as we went through the unbroken forests , checking the river from time to time on our right hand , that I , and we , and all of our kind , could never have any hope at all , never . Auntie was somehow cheerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift my spirits.  |p298We  saw the city once ; we had to swing far around some farms , and a settlement on our side of the river . The sun came out . The day grew bland . Could there have been such a typhoon ? Well beyond the city , in a stretch of the river called Tiger 's Fan Narrows , we saw ahead , once as we came out onto the bank , a seagoing junk , a lumbering Ningpo trader , its three great spars slightly canted , so it was evident that the ship had grounded itself on a bar . It was only about fifty feet from our shore , and we worked along the bank toward it . The towering blue transom with red facings was ill reflected in the muddy waters of the river ; her brown and yellow sails and their bamboo battens were furled and lashed upright along the masts . Peace dropped his pike in the river . As we drew abreast of her , the junk appeared idle , asleep , though we could hear some sort of bleating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handline in the shallow water over the near rail . " You will never catch a fish there , " Peace called out to the man . " Might catch a river pig . " " Run onto a bank ? " " Yes . Blew like the end of the world last night . " " Waiting for a tide ? " " Yes . " " When is it due ? " " When it comes . " The sailor shrugged . " Where are you running ? " " Home . Ningpo . " " Can you take a man ? " " And three women ? " " Just the man . These women are taking the day off . " " You are a sight ! " Yes , our clothes were muddy . " All right , son . He is sick . " The sailor pointed with his thumb over his shoulder at the cabin on the high stern , and obviously meant the captain . " We have nine billy goats on here , might as well have you . You hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was tied alongside and carried Peace out to the junk . Peace said nothing in parting , save , as the water widened between us , " You tell Solemn , now . " We turned upriver , and I could not bear to look back . Around a bend we took off our clothes and washed the mud out of themp299in the river , and they dried on us as we went on . This being a market day , we were bold . A white riverman carried us across the river to Twin Hills . " That was a typhoon last night , " he said , as he sculled us over . " Had to haul this cockleshell a half a li up the field so it would n't wash away . Had to do it alone . Our other slave , Sinner , he skipped out , do n't know where he 's gone . " The city was quiet . We walked out the Brook Road , and a slave ferried us across the still-swollen stream near Lu 's tavern . We cut around through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man saw us arrive . The men were all in their rooms , sleeping . Now it was the ninth month , and it all began againinformings , slapdash trials , beheadings , the feeling of nausea every day . The young master came back from **29;5876;TOOLONG on the double , and we saw more of him in a fortnightthan we had seen in nearly a year , saw that he was afraid , and that his overseer was angry and frustrated because the work was disrupted , for the crop was beginning to yellow , and it was time to cut the stalks off close to the ground and let the plants wilt and then take them in and hang them on the laths in the tobacco house ; but Top Man , the slaveherd , was exceedingly busy at the yamen in Twin Hills , telling the provincial magistrates that he had heard this , and that , and Overseer Li had to go and testify , and provincial guardsmen infested our place . How Top Man swaggeredin the quarter ! He was a person of importance to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he would be murdered in bed , so he swaggered to hide his terror . The first prisoners , about twenty of them , including Solemn , and , we heard , Ch'eng 's Candy , Fan the mix , and Wang 's Judge , but not Smart , were locked up in the new prison . A unit of the provincial guard was posted near Lu 's tavern , not far from us on the Brook Road , and it was said that War Lord Sun had asked the Emperor for reinforcementsfrom North-of-the-River . Peace and Ditcher were missing . On the twelfth day of the ninth month , on a knoll at the edge of the city , five white men were beheaded . Tree proposed to run away , and he began measuring himself for a description to go on a pass he wanted Smart to forge for him . Fan , the mix , was tried in the Chengchow yamen , and he wasp300discharged for want of evidence , because he was a free mixie , and the provincial justices , keenly protective of the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men who were slaves could not give testimony against a freeman , even though he might be partly white . Hearsay was fit enough for slaves , however , and five more were beheaded on the fifteenth , with the entire force of the yellow provincial guard commanded to watch . Some days we worked in a more or less orderly way , and one afternoon toward the end of the ninth month , as we were cutting the plants in gangs , Harlot sang a hymn , slow and sad , and to my amazement she improvised a pair of lines that were an unmistakable summons to a secret meeting in the smithy after dark  --  though she no longer used the phrase " Camp of Dan , " but sang " sword into plowshare . " As soon as I could I whispered a question to her about the call , and she said she knew nothing , only that Smart had told her to issue it . Rumors ran around the rest of the afternoon  --  that Peace was coming back to see us for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward , that we were going to start the whole thing up again without him . I shook my head at the report of his return ; I shook my head at any hope at all ... . Nightfall . Had Auntie , Harlot , and I any right to go to the meeting ? Woman of Timnath , whore of Gaza , Delilah of Sorekthatfevered imagination ! There was no more of all that now . Auntie crept to a whispered conference with Smart ; and Smart , sorrowing for his " brother " Solemn who had been beheaded , whispered with tears in his eyes , yes , yes , yes , he wanted us to attend . . . . The familiar lamp hung from the smoke-blackened joist . Our group was much smaller than it had used to be , and I was more conscious of the faces that were missing than of those that were there . On Smart 's bench , where Smart had so long ago traced in cinders for me the first two-lined character , " man , " a stranger sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three women entered he nodded to us in a jocular way , as if he knew us , a loose-jointed , slow-moving man , and when I saw him shrug his shoulders whilep301answering a question of Smart 's , I knew who he was : the crewmanon the Ningpo trader who had rowed ashore for Peace . He was called Bow Steersman ; perhaps that was his job on the vessel . When he began his story I sensed that he was carefree , airy , far from our mood  --  perhaps because he had never been enlisted in the war , perhaps merely because he was a homeless , anchorless crewman . " I saw him throw that stick with a knife lashed onto it in the river water ; he thought I did not but I did . Captain Ts'ui , he was down in his bunk with an earth fever . Queer man , that one . Moody  --  no , not moody . You just can not tell . You look in his face , and he has a grin on it , but his eyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour mouth and those eyes lighted up like the Scholars ' Garden in Twin Hills there . He does n't pay attention to what 's moving around outside his head  --  or in it , either one . Has little crinkles all around his eyes  --  from laughing ? I doubt it . Used to be an overseer , wo n't talk about it . Before we got off the bar there , Dogface , one of our men , he 'd been asleep in the crew 's mat shed forward , he waked up and came on deck , and he says , ' Al ! Are n't you Peace ? ' But he says , My name is Steady . ' When the tide came in , Captain Ts'ui got up , groaning and aching , and he set us some sail , and we moved off the sandbar . Two days later we all got wind about the reward , when we stopped at Lu P'an 's landing , and Salt and Dogface  --  Salt is the longest one to have been a slave to the captain there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't give Salt any papers , it was during a time the captain was a Lamaist that he said Salt could go free , but then he gave up being a Lamaist  --  he 's a man like that , never rests on one spot  --  and Salt was scared he 'd changed his mind , because the captain never said another word about it , sometimes gave Salt some money , other times shouted and cursed at him like a turtle . Anyway Salt and Dogface told him they suspected the big man that came aboard on the bar , that he was the one the reward was for , but Captain Ts'ui says , He came aboard as a free man , I ca n't touch him . ' Salt says , Where are his papers ? ' Captain Ts'ui says , He left them . ' Captain Ts'ui had been an overseer , he knows you do n't have a white man running around without a chit or some kind of proof . All right , we were eleven days on our down passage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Thousand Ducks Landing , or at Round House Landing , we could have hailed twenty vessels that were up-passaging.  |p302One  did hail us , Captain Yang boarded us , wanted to know whether it was safe to go up , with the slave revolt and all , but Captain Ts'ui said not a word about this man Peace or Steady that he had aboard there , two teeth missing , long hair , cut on the brow  --  exactly the man . Sometimes you would swear that Captain Ts'ui was walking around in a dream . We coasted down there to Ningpo and tied up on fenders alongside a big twenty-five-man junk , and Captain Ts'ui still said nothing to secure this man Peace , wrote his forms for the customs and said nothing in them at all about this runaway , sends Dogface ashore for some shortrationprovender at the market and no orders to Dogface about trying to secure the man . All right . Dogface sniffs the reward . He goes to a yellow man , Chiang , whom he knows , Chiang goes straight to the constables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constables Tung and Hsu  --  I know those bastards , just try to get slavey drunk and they 're on your neck like a pair of dirty ospreys  --  so they came on board and took him , and they asked Captain Ts'ui how it was he had not reported the man Peace all along the voyage , and he says , Look , teachers , look at my writing tablet and brushes here , I was just this second writing to Captain Tu , at the Emperor 's admiralty , to ask what to do with the man . ' Well , those two dirty bastard ospreys came back later and bound Captain Ts'ui over , to appear at the yamen and answer to the Emperor for doing nothing all that time . " " How did Peace seem when last you saw him ? " Smart asked . " I never saw a man so stiff before the constables , especially those two turtles . I tell you , he smacked all over of stubbornness , he stood there stubborn . They tried to get him to confess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to no one but Warlord Sun , in the yamen at Twin Hills , or else the Emperor himself . ' He would n't , either ; he pressed his lips tight . Those two hungry bastard ospreys were not used to pride in a white man , they shook him up hard , and he just looked as if he pitied them . I do n't know what good it did , though , they just ran him off in chains . " On eleventh month , seventh day , Peace was beheaded . We heard that his fortitude and dignity and inflexibility held upp 303to the very end  --  that he had refused to make a confession that would implicate anyone else , that he had said to them at his trial , " I know you set your minds on killing me long before you laid a hand on me  --  so why this look-like-a-trial , which is n't a trial at all ? " And that he had gone to the platform silent , calm , but hard to recognize as the terrible Peace , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long hair be all cut off and his head be altogether shaved . Three days later Ditcher gave himself up to the Twin Hills yamen , saying he wanted the reward of three hundred strings of cash , of a half catty each , that had been offered for his capture , to be given to a free white friend of his , Dirty Chi , who had persuadedhim to surrender . The authorities decided that , being white , Chi was entitled to but fifty strings . Ditcher was beheaded . On information from Top Man , the slaveherd , the guards arrestedSmart , and he was tried and beheaded . Brass and True , for their loyalty in discovering the plot to their master , were purchased by the Emperor 's treasury and set free . Altogether thirty-five slaves were beheaded ; four , who had been arrested , escaped and ran away ; one killed himself in prison . So we heard . The reinforcements of the Emperor 's guard were returned to North-of-the-River . The cost to the Emperor of the entire disturbance , the treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hundred twenty-nine catties of copper cash , so at least our war had cost them something . One day toward the end of the tenth month , a woman came back to our quarter from a day in the city  --  young Master Yen would issue no more passes to men  --  with a sheet of rice paper tucked under her gown that had been passed , hand to hand , from old Ku the Usher in the yamen down through the town , and that was , they said , an exact copy of official minutes , destined for the Emperor 's eyes , of a speech First Minister Hsieh was said to have made in the beautiful yamen in whose hallways the light slaps of my own bare feet had echoed one afternoon many hopes ago . I , who had learned to read from dead Smart , went from room to room along the street , reading the paper in whispers : " The accused , " the First Minister had said , " have shown a spirit which , if it becomes general , must swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their rights , a contempt for danger , and a thirst for revenge which portend the most unhappy consequences . " When I had finished the rounds , I was able to throw myself on myp304k'ang and sob out my heart , in mourning , at last , for our stiff , obdurate , compassionate seer and general , who had died with the locks of his strength and decency shorn . The paper had spoken of a spirit among the whites that was still dangerous . All my fire , it seemed just then , had been put out with Peace 's life . The Yens waited to make their move until the dust had settled  --  and the crop had been largely laid away . One day in mid-tenth the field hands were led in a body to the rear courtyard of the big house , the house slaves ' quarter , and we were formed into a line . One by one our people were admitted to the back door of the main courtyard , and later we saw those who had been taken inside walking singly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of the gate from the side courtyard , whence they had apparently been let out under orders to return to the field hands ' quarter without speaking to those still waiting in line . By and large the women were discharged from the house very soon after having been admitted ; men were kept longer . Auntie , however , who was ahead of me in the line , was kept an age , and when she finally left I saw her almost running toward the refuge of our mud huts , in great agitation . My turn came . Top Man , the slaveherd , appeared at the gate and beckoned to me . I was so nervous I stumbled and fell over the high gate sill ; a crackling laugh ran down the waiting line . Inside , an impression of darkness , heaviness . Top Man walked ahead . He led me into the side courtyard and to a room that seemed to be a tailor shop  --  where slave clothes were made , no doubt . Bolts of cheap cloth lay in a heap along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran a trestle table , on which numerous books and papers were spread , and behind this  --  my heart tripped  --  the yellow Matriarch was seated . The young master was standingto one side , beyond her ; he leaned against the wall picking his teeth with a quill , and he seemed to me even younger and more delicate than I had thought him that day in the tobacco house . Overseer Li was seated at one end of the worktable . Top Man stood beside me . " Name ? " the Matriarch asked  | " Small White Lotus , Big Mistress , " Top Man said . " Yes , " the woman curtly said , and she leafed through a large ledger . " Ayah , yes , White Lotus . Let us see . " She was far smaller and slighter than I had thought her , and her voice was mild and soft , and I kept thinking , Could her gods be more powerful than Jehovah ? Peace had said over and over that he was going to kill her . " Purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notations in the big book , " from Uncle ' Ch'en , seventy-two catties of cash . Eleven twenty-six : Reprimanded by Duke for chasing around big house after laundering . " The eyes , dark as the night mists on the ice pond , turned up to me . " Ai , yes , I remember you , I wanted you in the house the day you came , but Duke said you would cause trouble among the domestics , among the men . Has she , Small Top Man , down at the field quarter ? " " She is one of those three who messed about with Peace . " " Yen ! " Addressing her son rather sharply by his patronymic , the Matriarch did not turn her head but seemed to be listening for the young man 's whereabouts , as if she thought he might be tiptoeing out of the room behind her back . " Yes , T'ai-t'ai . " " I believe Duke is getting senile . " " If you say so , T'ai-t'ai . " The two , and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Number One Houseboy . I was too agitated to take in what they meant , but I sensed that both the son and the overseer were helplessly bored , that the yellow mother was one of those plodding , thorough , domineering women who want to do things in an orderly way but can not help running off into endless digressions . I had , very strongly , the feeling I had so often experienced in the Shen dining room , in the Northern Capital , of not being present . Above all , I felt that the three yellow people in the room were carrying on their business , whatever it was , with a wholly inappropriateflatness and dryness of feeling : I was rigid with fear ; they had been in mortal danger ; they were planning , I sensed , to assert with utter finality their mastery over their rebellious slaves  --  but it was all bored , congenial , distant , punctuated with sighs . She was reading again from the ledger in a dull voice , and before long I was overwhelmed by her words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen talking with Mink a few days after the rails were badly piled ; good work as a runner in the tobacco house ( someone had seen me ! ) ; first night visit to the smithy ; other visits , with hours of departure and return ; to Twin Hills with Peace ; idle , joking , and snickering during a haying ; constantly on Peace 's gown-skirt in market-day pastimes  --  fish feast on six twenty-four , pig roast on seven twentyeight . . . . Mostly from Top Man but much of it from some other informer or informers , because several of the entries were about actions which Top Man could not have known  --  all neatly noted down . " Were you intimate with Peace ? " " What , Venerable Matriarch ? " I asked , startled . " Did you know his plans ? " " No , Venerable Matriarch . " " You went everywhere with him , did n't you ? " " No , Venerable Matriarch , " I said . " Never . " She spoke over her shoulder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They do n't know what the truth is , T'ai-t'ai . " " Well , what do you think , son ? Li , what do you say to this one ? " The overseer waited , seething with dutiful respect . The son put a hand over his eyes and said , " Come , T'ai-t'ai . You had your mind made up about this girl before we started . Ca n't we move along ? How many more , Top Man ? " " I 'll go and count them , Big Master . " " Stay where you are , " the woman said . " Li ? " " Sell , Mistress . " " I think so . Get the next one , Top Man . " Top Man led me to the house slaves ' gate . It could not be done all at once , for we were a glut on the market . All the masters were selling slaves whom they did not trust . The Yens wanted to sell eleven slaves , field hands  --  and with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were right about some and wrong about some . There were nine males and two females on the list , and seven of the men had indeed supportedPeace beyond others . But Mink was on the list , and Harlotp307was not . I suppose Mink 's bent back recommended him for sale ; and we all guessed that Top Man , the slaveherd , had for some time fancied having a handmaiden himself and that he may have eased the reports on Harlot , who was , besides , of the sort that the yellow people considered intelligent  --  yellowish skin and " good eyes " of a mix ; had been a house slave ; was , maybe , the old master 's back-courtyard whelp . The idea of parting from her made me weep every night . On an afternoon early in the eleventh month a large wagon , with a high wooden fence set on its bed and braced with metal bands , came for us . The same green boy that had carried Mink and me out from the city , so long before , was driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were along as guards . Mink and I recognized the boy at once , but he looked right through us . We set out . We could see tops of trees over the fencing as we lurched along and , much later , the roofs of city houses . When the tail gates of the tall box were opened and we jumped down , we saw that we were in an area enclosed by a high brick wall ; in the foreground we saw a small pleasure garden  --  round stone tables , lanterns , fish pools ; beyond were two large buildings with ominous iron bars in their gates . We were led to one of these , men and women together . The following morning the commission merchantwho owned this big slave jail , " Uncle " Ch'en , came to inspect us , a fat man , all smiles , carrying a canary on his shoulder , one leg of which was attached by a delicate long silver chain to his little finger . He made a wry face when he saw Mink , and he pinched me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cheer up , small boys and girls , I 'll get you settled comfortably . I 'm going to find you each and every one a sweet master . " We waited six days . They fed us meal and salt fish . On the afternoon of the sixth day we were led out of the jail building and were filed past a storehouse , and yellow attendants handed us bright clothes to dress ourselves in : I was given a curious blue tapelike smock with yellow figures on it , which fastened around my neck on a kind of drawstring ; I was not allowed to wear my dirty shift under it . Some of the men had brilliant pantaloons : crimson , orange , purple ! We were taken into a yard surrounded by a fence of bamboo palings . It grew dark ; lanterns were hung in our enclosure , and the place seemed cheerful . We heard sounds of laughter and applause from the direction of the pleasure garden . A pair of yellow attendants brought a bucketp308and some tin cups  --  and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed as a rooster , short , paunchy , with a cockscomb cap on his head and arching feathers attached to his buttocks , whirled out among us , and he began to juggle burning batons , and he spun china plates high on balance sticks , and his fingers like blowing ribbons made a coin appear , disappear , come from his ear , sprout from a slave 's nose . We laughed ! We laughed ! Someone put a hand on my shoulder : It was the poor-yellow boy with the fuzz on his chin who had driven the cart out and the wagon in , and he beckoned to me . I followed him out of the enclosure . I was charged with two drams ' heat and the wild images of a suddenly enchanted world ; I wanted to whoop . We made a turn around a small building and were suddenly in the pleasure garden . Circles of yellow men  --  not a single woman  --  sat around bowls and bottles at the many tables ; bright lamps shone down from the trees . " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assemblage , and with a silver-headed stick he waved me toward a kind of fence stile , a set of wooden steps leading up to , and down from , a platform . He smiled patronizingly at me , and with the residue of confused joy in my throat I smiled back at him . " Ai , " he cried , " gentlemen and alley thieves ! " The crowd laughed . " Look at her . Happy child of nature . Strong , supple , cheery , willing , young . . . " Hooo ! A queer sensation . I felt as I climbed the steps as if I were walking downward into icy water . " Come forward if you are interested . Inspect . Satisfy yourselves fully on any purchase you make of Uncle ' Ch'en , my jolly boys . " Have pity , white God ! I was for sale . O God , O God , if you have any power , but I know that you do not , give me a bland master . A pair of hands reached round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smock , and it was pulled open , like a pair of curtains . The faces began to swim before my eyes  --  grizzled traders , some of them , to be sure , but also many young men , hardly more than boys , out for a night 's adventure . I saw moisture on lips . My head began to cloud ; I thought I would collapse . " All right ! All right ! Seats , gentlemen ! That 's all , that 's all . Down you go , my champions ! " The hands were at my throat , the curtains were drawn , the string was bowed . Then at my very ear a sudden chanting began in a twangy voice : an auctioneer , standing beside me and a little behind me , crying me off . I heard bids pounded on the stone tables with stone blocks in a code of stone sounds . The auctioneer 's voice rose in tone to an operaticp309falsetto  --  a maniac 's singing . " Riding high , riding slow , time is short , life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The sun high , the sun hot , ride my donkey home tonight . Now . Low moon , cold moon . Bid her now . " With each " now " there was a rumble of stone on stone before me . Then suddenly it was over . " Next , next , next , " " Uncle " Ch'en was saying . " Move her off of there . Look sharp ! " I was given a shove down the steps , and the boy led me back to the jail . But who had bought me ? We were carried out of Twin Hills next day in six open wagons , still in our festival clothes . Bystanders stopped and looked at us , and surely they were thinking : How humane ! Not many slaves are treated so well as that ! We rode over the canal bridge and two miles into the country . The caravan stopped . We were unloaded . Men stood in a ring around us with pistols in their hands at half cock . We were ordered out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange ; mine was much too big . Our forty-odd men were chained by the wrists , alternating left and right , into two coffles , Ayah , now we knew that we must have been bought by a slave merchant from the terrible outer provinces . Auntie and three other Yen slaves were in our caravan . Mink was not . The empty wagons turned back , and when a wagon loaded with provisions and six yellow men on muleback came along the road from the city , we began to march . We covered fifteen li that day and every day that followed , for twenty-three days . The riders carried bamboo rods . Nights we spent in slave jails , paddocks , godowns , and pens . I wept in Auntie 's arms.  |p313I  WAS BOUGHT in a small-town slave sale by a man who was out at the elbows . He turned away after inspecting me , and I saw the holes in his sleeves and the horny pads of yellow skin over the sharp bones . He was a young farmer , in his late twenties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the slave merchant that he was ginning at Sun Laoyeh'splace , he would have to go back out to his farm for the money ; he would send a hog in later with the cash for the girl , and to carry her out , he said . My owner in rags ! But his face was like the surface of a lake ; he had bought me at a bargain . I waited in the packed dirt courtyard of the inn where the merchanthad staged his sale . Yellow men came and went , laughing and cursing ; perhaps there was a gambling room inside . In the afternoon an elderly slave came to fetch me . He was wearing a woven reed hat which bore a paper notice , written in inelegant characters : DO NOT TOUCH THIS HOG OR TIGER WILL EAT YOU " Where did you get those filthy bags ? " he asked me , looking scornfully at my clothes . " Hua T'ai-t'ai will give you a gown of louse bedding . " This was the cheapest cotton cloth.  |p314He  took me on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My escort sonorously announced his name as Chick Fuch'inor Daddy Chick . He boasted about his own trustworthiness . " I do n't even have to carry a chit to leave the farm . See this hat ? " He tapped the oiled paper on his hat with its warning . " Hua looks out for me . " Hua was our owner , apparently the tiger of the hat notice . Daddy Chick made himself sound astonishingly familiar with our master . Daddy Chick said he himself was a number-one fiddler ; he was fifty-four , a pious man , he told me . " I never complain . I bear everything . I am a good servant and I am affectionate to others . Hua gives me money and sends me after rice up at the town . They bring the rice in oxcarts from Tsingtao , the rice carters blow horns all night when they camp along the road to scare away the rats . Look , we have rats the size of wonks in Shantung . Listen ! Hua lets me carry his money off any day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash belt stuffed like a meat dumpling to buy you . What 's your name ? " He affected sharp behavior toward me . Daddy Chick said that the old mistress took the hogs and sows and piglets right into the house . You would think that Jasmine 's piglets were her own children ! Hua  --  he used to be an overseer , Daddy Chick said , quite offhand . Old Sun , a rich cotton-planter , fathered Hua along and set him up as a farmer . " We , " Daddy Chick said , as if he were one of the proprietors , " we have twelve hundred mu of land  --  not enough . Right now we are picking . Ginning . Baling . Good year this year . Hua is happy as a canary . He has n't used the bamboo but once in the year , when Lank stole a swine . Lank hid the meat in Grin 's k'ang . " He got you cheap , " Daddy Chick said , tossing a glance at me , like a gob of spit , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a slow plan , ha-ha ! Buys a young sow , and maybe she 'll have a piglet , one this year , one next year , one , one , one , one .... " The old slave 's hand chopped out a whole generation o ! ' new Hua slaves . " He 's young . He can wait .... Our Moth is pregnantat the present time . " The country road was like a great continuous ditch ; myriad wheels had compressed its bed far below the level of the fields . Once when we were mired Daddy Chick said , " We say around here , A daughter-in-law sours at last into a mother-in-law ; a road in a thousand years becomes a river . ' "  |p315This  depressed track was crowded with carts and barrows , and we were forced to stop often . Carters contended in an endless warfare of fake haste ; Daddy Chick was insolent to whites and like silk with passing yellows . We pulled out of the ruts at a precarious angle to let a cart pass that was stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing birds . Slaves , their heads shaved shiny , jogged along with heavy loads  --  of melons , night soil , raw hemp , sesame oil  --  on shoulder poles , trailing strong smells behind them . All around us were cotton fields in full fruit , blowing in the dry wind , glorious green seas with a billion whitecaps , flecks of froth , foam , spindrift . We came to a cornerstone with a lion carved on its head , and Daddy Chick jumped down from the cart , climbed out of the road 's gully , and with his hub-oil brush daubed the lion 's face , which was already black with carters ' oil . This was to propitiate the guardian of the road , in order to ward off accidents . " Ai , " my escort said , remounting , " I lost an axle near here last month . " Soon : " Here we are . " In the flooded pits beside the road , from which earth had been taken for the building of the new master 's houses , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pigs , children , and slaves ' children swimming and playing with an uproar of splashes , giggles , wing flaps , oinks , honks , quacks , and shrieks ; a holiday bedlam that jarred on my grief , bewilderment , and weak hope . Daddy Chick shook his head like a patron at the sight . With a finger cracked and slashed for many years by the brittle dry calyxes of cotton bolls , he pointed at the yellow and white childrenplaying together like brothers and sisters , and he named them for me : " Hua children : Barley Flower , Cart Tongue , Stone , and Little Four . Grin and Jasmine 's children : Perfection , Bargain , Tale , and Tender . " All were naked , save Perfection , a big girl on whose gently swelling promises a cotton-sack shift glistened , white on white , more immodest than skin . This man Hua was barely scraping along  --  gourd pots and pails in the house . For a broom , to sweep the uneven dirtp316floor , someone had taken sage twigs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten souls : Daddy Chick , Grin and Jasmine and their four children , a man named Lank and a girl named Moth , and , now , me . The main house , made of mud from the pits where I had seen such jubilation , was on the north end of a walled courtyard , and it was a dirty box-shaped hutch of only three " spaces , " end to end , a space being so much as could be covered by timbers of a certain length , perhaps twelve feet . The entrance door was double-leafed , just two worn wide boards hung on pins . Inside the door , in the middle space , was the mud cookstove with its thin metal boiler in the shape of a shallow bowl . Slices of eggplant were sizzling in it , and the house was full of garlicky smoke . Above the range , fat , sooty , and seeming to laugh at man 's endless strivings to fill his belly and ease his loins , was Tsao Wang , the kitchen god , on a cheap print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hua 's sleeping area , a huge k'ang spanning the far end , stacked with rolled-up quilts , wooden boxes , baskets of all shapes ; upon it , I supposed , the entire family slept . The third " space " was a work place , with a spinning wheel , a loom , farm implements , jars of grain , carpentering tools , and a bats ' cave of miserable hoardings hanging from spikes in the rafters ; sieves , scythes , old shoes , an abacus , a teeming wealth of poverty . Why , this master 's house was no better than the slaves ' quarters at Yen 's ! Six mangy wonks panted and snapped at flies in the shade of the wall in the courtyard . I Eating All TogetherHua 's wife , who was at least fifteen years older than he , took me into the sleeping space and drew out of one of the baskets on the big k'ang a gown of gray louse bedding for me . She said I could use what I was wearing for work in the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ; the axe of worry had nicked her unmercifully there . " Are your bowels clean ? " she asked me.  |p317She  jogged on her bound feet as if on stubby stilts . " Turn the eggplant , " she said , and my work as a slave began . Before long Hua and his little force came in from work . They were covered with lint from the ginning , and the man called Lank could not stop sneezing . The master seemed to me cheerful , sturdy , and phlegmatic . " Where is my sun hat ? I 'll need it tomorrow . " His wife told him , and he got it down from the rafters with a hooked pole . Daddy Chick , Grin , and Lank all had shaved heads , and I soon learned that men slaves in Shantung , or East-of-the-Mountains , were called , besides pigs , hares , because the words for " bald " and " hare " were homophones . Women slaves , if good breeders , were , I learned , sometimes called rabbits . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy , and was apparentlyunmarried , would be such a one . The children rushed in , excited , reverberating still with their squeals of the muddy-watered pit , and famished . One warning from the mistress silenced them all . The naked ones , yellow and white alike , were tossed plain shirts that came to their navels . We ate all at the same time , the Huas with their children sitting cross-legged on their big k'ang , we slaves in the workroom , squatting on our hams . Jasmine kept slapping her smaller ones , Tale and Tender , who were still brimming with giggles , into silence . In the bustling about in the smoky house , and during the meal , when comments on the day 's work were shouted back and forth between spaces , Daddy Chick maintained an uninterrupted flow of affirmation of the yellow man 's thoughts and wishes , " Yes , Master ! Hai ! Imagine ! Number-one certain . Yes , yes . Ayah , I believe it . No doubt . Ai , ai ! Ha-ha-ha , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken curtly of Hua-this and Hua-that now seemed quite lacking in any sense of self at all . The master treated him like a shuttlecock to bounce on his heels , and the old man flew into the air at each kick gaily and even eagerly . The eggplant slices that I had carefully tended were reserved for the master alone . I had an impression of Hua 's wife 's strong will . Her voice cut like a cleaver , but I must say she was polite to us all . " Old Sun 's muskmelons are bad this year , " the master , maliciouslyhappy , shouted from the distance with his mouth full . " Like round stones . "  | " Hayah ! " shouted Daddy Chick back again . " They are ! Ha-haha . That 's good , Master ! That 's wonderful ! Like nothing but stones . Did you hear that , Lank ? " Lank , chewing slowly and moistly like a camel , nodded . After supper we slaves retire to our quarter . If Hua 's house seemed poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts there hangs over the single room a grid of rotten timbers and rotten purlins holding an enormous weight of sodden earth spread over a matting of kaoliang stalks . When will it crush us ? Here there are two k'angs , one for Grin 's family , the other for the rest of us . No windows . A moldy smell . A blackened interiorwhich points to a stove whose chimney is built of timber in the body with a funnel of mud stacks . A cloth hangs down to set aside privacy for Grin 's family . At the very first glance I see a sign of dissension : a shelf with two gourd water buckets and two gourd dippers . And yes , shortly Moth and Jasmine quarrel , at first over the hanging of a washed gown and then over Tender 's urinating on the floor on the wrong side of the cloth drop . Daddy Chick says , " Be quiet , or I 'll get Hua to sell you both . " This warning does not bring anything like peace . Peace ! That word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this place we have heard strange reports . The Empire , following its ancient cycle of unification and disintegration , has begun to divide into two great parts : the core provinces around the NorthernCapital , loyal to the gentle dynasty ; and the periphery , the lands of the coast and south of the rivers , restive under the central rule with its feminine principles yet at the same time groaning under numerous warlords , each of whom , it is said , whirls on his bed at night in mad dreams of usurpation and coronation . In the Northern Capital , Emperor Ch'ang-lo 's early liberalismhas been followed by a sudden series of swings from meticulous tyranny to riotous benevolence . We slaves now yearn for the Northern Capital , where , we hear , slaves have been set free ! In the most recent flicker of enlightenment , slavery itself has been sentenced to death by a few strokes of a soft brush tracingp319Ch'ang-lo 's command on the red paper of happiness . And followingupon this decree , the white-skinned slaves in the core provinceshave been bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are said to be making their way , though with great difficulty , as a caste of unskilled laborers , servants , and farm hands , beasts of burden but free beasts . Out on the periphery , where I am , we are no less slaves than ever . God with a white face has proved to be of no practical aid to us ; prayers to Him fell to the hard ground . I have gathered that the whites in this area are now inclining to yellow idols , yellow kowtowing , yellow incense braziers , yellow rituals , yellow dreams  --  to yellowness itself , a moiety of which we can , by being raped , achieve . Our life here is the pursuit of a false syllogism : The yellows are free ; we will imitate the yellows and liken ourselves to them ; we will be free . Ha ! And I ? I am eighteen . Exhausted after the long march in the coffle , huddling in this rude slave shack , I am eager to conform to the yellowing tendency among all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life more into my own hands , if I can . It is not quite dark . I manage , by the most careful maneuvering , to lie down on the k'ang , where we are going to be rather crowded , between Moth and the place against the back wall reserved for Daddy Chick . Moth has tried to get me to sleep next to Lank , but I suspect that her pregnancy has to do with that proximity , and I appeal to Daddy Chick . " Sleep next to me , little cat , " he says , with a creasing , something like a smile , around his lips in the half light that makes me wonder if I have chosen wisely . Before the cheap lithograph of Tsao Wang , the kitchen god , plastered above our stove , Daddy Chick kowtows on the dirt floor , and in a singsong like that of a paid supplicator he prays for grace and fortitude to help him and all of us to overcome our trials , and for self-denial , humility , patience , obedience , and , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one last sneeze and begins at once to snore . In the doorway Daddy Chick plays , mostly off key , a sad song on his snakeskin-faced Tartar fiddle . When he stops I can hear Grin and Jasmine making the two-backed animal on their earthen bed beyond the cloth drop.  |p320We  picked in pairs , and Moth , my partner , working along the opposite side of the row from me , taught me what to do . The plants , which lightly interlaced their outer branches across the middles , were nearly as tall as we , and I could see Moth 's expression  --  the face of one who was puzzled by life , yet cheerful ; rather stupid , yet wily , too . She had a thin high-pitched voice and a lively interest in accidents , bloodshed , danger . " Have you ever seen a boar ' ? " " What is that ? " " Do you not know about the boars ' ? " " No . " And she explained in an excited voice , holding down its sound so Hua , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear her , and poking her face forward among the beautiful splashes of white lint , that " boars " were runaway slaves who lived in groups , like packs of wonks , in the hills and forests . Runningaway , Moth said , was called " going to the mountain . " " Why mountain ? " " T'ai Mountain . " I had heard , even in South-of-the-River , of T'ai Mountain , the sacred mountain of the eastern provinces , to which pilgrims from all over the Empire made their way in the second month of each year , and where , if he reached it , a runaway slave could not be touched by a yellow hand and could purchase the papers of a freedman and go under safe conduct to the core provinces . Suddenly , with a sinking spell , a softening of my knees , . I saw a picture from the immeasurably distant past  --  of a Sunday- , evening playtime dash across an Arizona courtyard from a hiding place behind a wheel in the pottery shed to " safe home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and squealing ( had the sight of Perfection in her glistening sheath at the mudhole stirred up such a memory ? ) , " Free in ! Free in ! Free in ! " A sack for the lint I picked from the plants hung by a strap from my neck , its mouth at my breast , its foot bouncing against my feet . I was terrified . My hands were clumsy . Master had assignedme a task , for this first day , of seventy catties  --  the " standard " for a woman being a picul , or a hundred catties . Moth hadp321whispered with glittering eyes that Hua would beat me with a bamboo rod if I did not complete my task . " Daddy Chick said Hua had only used the bamboo once this year , " I whispered through the branches . For answer Moth , after glancing on tiptoe over the rows to make sure that Hua was not looking , quickly lifted off the loop of her lint bag and , turning her back to me , suddenly peeled up her louse-bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see many long welts of scar tissue . Swiftly she lowered her dress again and put on her bag , and her fingers flew to the bolls . Whom was I to believe ? How long ago had this happened to Moth ? How could I tell how much I had picked ? Hua worked hard ! He had struck a gong to waken us in the morning , and he had done chores and had burned paper money and set off firecrackers for Shen Nung , the god of farming , and Ch'ung Wang , god of insects , and T'u Ti , the local constable god , and had been getting out the picking bags and baskets before we even reached the house . Now he and Perfection had finished a row ; Moth and I were barely a third done with ours . I asked , " What is he like ? " " Hua ? " I nodded . ( I already thought nothing of our calling this man , who could do anything he wanted with us , plain Hua . ) " One good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Never even sips it . He works hard . You see how he works . " " How can Perfection go so fast ? " " She keeps both hands flying , the little whore . Hua can last us all out . Endurance ! I 'll tell you something else . He 's grateful . If you try hard , he is thankful , very courteous . " Then a kind of pout formed at her mouth , and she said , " But he lies , and he can be very cold , very cruel . " There was a teasing look in Moth 's eyes that confused me . She leaned toward me , parting the branches with her graceful hands . " Masters in East-of-the-Mountainsare famous for their cruelty . They cut off noses , use the branding iron , chop off the legs at the knees . " Her voice became so , confidential as to seem warmly friendly . " I knew a hog , named Fairhead , his master cut his chestnuts out . " She stood on tiptoe and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " This Fairhead could still do it . " Moth giggled , and I lost sight of her as she ducked to pick the lower branches.  |p322Some  of the bolls had been blasted by worms ; the top crop was touched with dry rot . How long the row already seemed , and the day had scarce begun ! At the ends of the rows were the huge split-bamboo baskets , one for each picker , into which we would have to empty our bags many , many times ; my sack was not yet full once . The tips of my fingers were getting raw ; my neck and upper arms ached . " Wait , " Moth said with a sudden note of tenderness toward me in her voice , " it 's not bad . You and I will have a good time over at Old Sun 's place some night . Lank 's not the only one . There are plenty of nice fat hogs over there . You wait , sweet child . We 'll get them to stand up . " She made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger , the back of her pretty hand toward me . ( But what of the swelling in your belly , Moth ? ) " How big a place is that ? " Moth opened her arms in a great arc of immensity and joy . " A hundred slaves , " she said , but I could not tell whether she was merely using the round number in the yellows ' manner , to express a plenty , such as , " enough for you and me . " " Old Sun is rich , " she said . " Look ! " On tiptoes yet again , she pointed off across the fields , and , craningmyself , I saw a tall structure , and at its peak two great wooden arms reaching down and out in a vast possessive embrace , as if to grasp at the whole countryside , even at us . These were the turning arms of Old Sun 's cotton press . Moth said the old miser allowed Hua , who could not yet afford a gin and press , to store and process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , posing as Hua 's benefactor , extorted one bale in ten for this " kindness . " We would carry our pickings over to the Sun place at the end of the day and put them in Hua 's lint stall . Then , said Moth , I 'd see some of those fat hogs over there . " Ayah ! " sighed Moth , as though the service of those delightful pigs at Sun 's were a heavy , heavy burden . When the sun stood high , Hua 's wife , with Barley Flower , Cart Tongue , Stone , Little Four , Bargain , Tale , and Tender milling around behind her like puppies , brought food and water out to the field on a slide pulled by the skin-and-bones donkey Daddy Chick had used the day before to cart me out from the district town . I noticed this : Hua 's wife treated Jasmine as something like a beloved friend , but toward Moth she was stiff , reserved , andp323even hostile . If I was to get on the good side of the mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Moth  --  at least , in Hua 's wife 's presence . When we went back to picking , I brazenly asked Moth whom she would claim as the father of her baby . The only answer I got was tinkling laughter . I could not see Moth 's face ; she was low on a plant . Shortly afterward she said fiercely , " Be careful ! You are breakingsome of the branch ends . Old turtle Hua will beat you dead . " But she meant no harm . Soon she was joking and giggling again . She was like an autumn day , when a brisk wind blows little rainless clouds rapidly across the face of the sun ; the bright intervals are warm but somehow melancholy , for the summer is surely over . Each boll had four or five compartments . I had for a few momentsafter the meal seen Perfection 's deft fingers pluck out the entire contents of a boll at a time with a single snatch of either hummingbird hand , and she kept the lint , as she pulled it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had frequently to pick several times at a boll to empty it , and Moth told me that it took ninety to a hundred good bolls to make a catty . I was often on the edge of tears . What kind of life was this ? " Tell me more about the boars , " I said . " Ai , they 're filthy , like badgers . Sometimes they hide around Limestone Hill Generous Temple , I 've seen some of them there . They want salt and kaoliang . Some hogs steal fowl or cuts of pork from their masters and slip it to them at the temple . Why , they live in caves , ten , twelve , twenty together . " " Are they ever caught ? " " Ai , those turtles are hard on slave-hunters . You see , they all have knives , and some even have guns they 've stolen . You know what they do ? " Again Moth was leaning forward , her confidential mouth a blossom among the leaves . " They stab the slave-hunters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirated whisper  --  " they shin them and eat them . That 's what Lank says . " " Do you believe Lank ? " " Ainh , he 's harmless . " " Is he the father of your baby ? " The face withdrew from the bower of cotton leaves ; no giggle this time ; no temper , either . " Two months ago the boars raided a farm five li from here ,  |p324Big  Cheng 's place  --  and they stole three sows . " Moth waited . " I mean slave women , sweet child . " " Would you like to live like that ? " " Ayah , do n't even think about it . This is a cleaner life , child . " " Moth . " " What ? " " Is Hua the father ? " This time the silvery laughter ended in an explosive obscenity . " You ask questions like a virgin , small baby . " " I 'm not . " " Who is ? " " Why did you call Perfection a whore ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . " In the evening we jogged with the baskets of lint on shoulder poles , teaming in pairs to carry pairs of baskets , through fields of cotton , kaoliang , millet , melons and squashes , sweet potatoes , hemp , and sesame , to the big place . I was terrified , because my basket held so much less than anyone else 's . What prosperity we came upon ! Everything built of bricks . The outer wall of the workshop yard brightly decorated with patterns of brick and painted plaster . Glints of china and glass at the crown of the wall , to keep out robbers for sure . The wonks fat and glossy-coated . Carts with well-greased hubs . Slaves in uniform tunics and pants . The storage godown was next to the gin house  --  a brick structureon stilts , where , underneath , a pair of blindfolded mules went round and round , turning the cogged iron pinion of the gin , while men slaves , above , fed in the raw lint , and others , at the foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the trash . I was ashamed of my foul slave-trader 's clothing . We went in the godown . The master weighed the baskets . My yield was less than fifty catties ; my heart pounded . Hua turned to me , with a mild and even gentle expression , and asked , " Have you picked cotton before , child ? " " Never . " I could barely hear my own voice . " You must do better . " So much for my beating ! I glanced at Moth , and I was unablep325to suppress a titter at her mischievous expression . At this Hua gave me a deep look , of interest rather than reproach , which chilled me to the spine . Hua , Lank , and Grin emptied their baskets into the bins reserved for my master 's crop , and we left for home . I felt elated at having been let off so easily , and at the light weight of the empty baskets . We trotted . Crossing the courtyard I looked up once more at the gin , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chutes , wearing a clean uniform of the Sun force , stood a man who seemed to me to be Peace . I tripped and fell . The shoulder pole broke . One of the baskets struck the backs of Moth 's legs , and she turned and shrilly cursed me . From my crouch on hands and knees I looked up at the big man , who , with a bare head , bright-eyed and relaxed , was raucouslylaughing at my clumsiness . Day after day , row after row , boll after boll after boll , I could think of nothing save that man laughing on the dizzying platform . I had the impression  --  perhaps because of the height , the foreshortening  --  thatthis man was not quite so huge as I remembered Peace to have been ; that he was not gap-toothed , but seemed to have a full set of unclean teeth ; that the scar on the brow , with the look it had given of displeased astonishment , had faded , and so had the prophet 's stare ; the shaggy braided cone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The face , against the evening sky , with a glow of the sun on it , had been sly , canny , cynical , selfish , ruthless  --  all that a slave 's face should be . I melted at the thought of it . On the k'ang at night I felt illuminated like a lantern ; once I awakened from desire-fuming sleep with my cheek against a hard rib cage , and I pressed myself to it , only to start up with shame and disgust  --  Daddy Chick . Moth 's suggestive talk stirred me to lewd answers such as I had never given . I was apt to swing my hips right before Hua 's eyes . I stroked the fur of fleabittenwonks with great tenderness . All the time , at every moment , I was thinking of that figure on the gin-house platform . My life was unquestionably horrible . I was eighteen  --  ready forp326harvest . Except for flashing thoughts , in moments of utmost frustrationand rage , of " the mountain , " there was no hope of any kind in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like all the slaves around me , to take what I could from each rotten hour as it passed . Several days passed before I saw him again . We had filled Boa 's lint bins , and it was time for a day of ginning and baling . When we went to work that morning , the man I had seen was in the squad of four Sun slaves detailed to make sure that Hua 's worthlessriffraff , as Old Sun regarded us , did not ruin his beautiful cotton press . When I first noticed him he was again on a raised platform , brushing vegetable oil onto the massive wooden screw of the cottonpress . He was singing , but he seemed surly . I saw him dust off a fellow Sun slave who tried to joke with him . But when I caught his eye for the first time , he immediately lost his footing and mockingly sprawled on the loading platform at the top of the long oblong box of the press ; he threw his arms around the screw as if to save himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall I had taken in the courtyard that day . I could not , however , catch him looking at me for a long time afterward . But at last I did . From then on my eyes were often on him , and he knew it . I was assigned with Grin to the task of laying out the strips of hemp bagging at the foot of the press , to be wrapped up over the bales after the landscape-grasping wooden arms , moved by blindfoldedmules on a circular track , had driven down the huge wooden screw and packed the feathery ginned lint into a hard hexahedron . And with a huge curved steel needle and hemp string I swiftly sewed the edges of the sacking while Grin made fast the ropes that kept the bales confined . ( Pompous Duke at Yen 's had said I " would not do " as the terrible Matriarch 's seamstress ! But look at me now ! ) I had had the sense to rip my slave-trader 's bags , as if accidentally , one day , beyond repair , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body moved freely in the clinging sheath . Grin was obsessed with hunting . Hua loaned him his awkward , heavy gun , from time to time , to shoot rabbits , weasels , and ground foxes , which Hua 's wife cooked for all of us to eat . In the manner of limited men with one-track minds , Grin could remember , and gladly recited , every detail of every pursuit in his entirep327life , and now , as we waited for the huge screw to worm down , he was telling me about a certain weasel whose habits he had studied in a long , patient , delicious savoring of the moment when he would finally shoot it  --  how it would slink along the edge of the upper kaoliang field , pause in the shade of the lion-headed marker beyond the irrigation well that we called Big Lizard , and dart toward the duck run with its low mud-brick wall . On and on Grin went with his tedious working out of his perverted lust  --  until , suddenly , an interruption came to my relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform had been lubricating the squeaking ridges of the male wooden screw , fell directly at my feet . " Hai ! Turtle ! Down there ! Throw me up my brush . " These shouts were addressed to Grin , but I had already bent down and snatched up the brush , and I looked up , to see the shouter leaning over the edge of his platform . Hua was in the gin house at the time . When he saw the brush in my hand , the man unveiled his dirty teeth in a smile that made me wonder whether he had dropped the brush at my feet on purpose . " Ayah , " he called , " there 's little FallDown . Throw it up to me , you sweet little sow . Let 's see if you can . " I shook the brush at him , in a little threat . What a glorious man he was ! He had all the power of a Peace who had shed , as a locust sheds its taut waxy skin , the saintly , ascetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he had Nose 's abandoned , disenchanted air without the awful melancholy of those bloodshot eyes ; and Arizona Gabe 's fresh , unspoiled physicalstrength , too . But there was a new quality , close to the surface , visible in his frank face and manner , a trait which seemed to me perfect in a slave  --  utter selfishness . I coiled myself , with the brush hanging down from my fist behindmy back , to try to throw it up to him on the platform , knowingin advance , with a warmth of inner laughter , that I would fail . But before I could unwind he sharply shouted down , " Watch out ! Do n't trip yourself ! Be careful ! Do n't fall down ! " Now I was laughing out loud . I threw the brush . It arose end over end but had not half the force it needed ; it plopped against the box of the press , leaving a fan-shaped stain of oil on the dry wood , and fell again to the ground . The slave on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grin joined in , but faintheartedly . Moth , feeding Grin and me sacking from a heap in the corner , slapped my rump in playful rebuke . " Try again , little Fall-Down ! Throw it again . " I ran and picked up the brush . Now all work had stopped in the press as everyone , with cheerful face , leaned to watch . The great screw groaned ; Lank was outside leading the mules . I bent even lower than before and let the brush fly ; it went higher this time but arched far away from the platform . Everyone laughed . " Ayah , what a dangerous sow ! " the man on the platform called out . The other Sun men up there with him roared and punched each other . I ran again for the brush . I laughed as I ran . I was tightening myself for the greatest pitch of all when I sensed a sudden silence , renewed activity . I straightened . Hua was standing directly behind me , his face a typhoon edge . " What game is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild , henpecked yellow man 's sudden fatherly severity . Daddy Chick , who had apparently come into the press with our owner , stepped around him toward me and took the oil brush out of my hand and looked up toward the platform . " Who was using this ? " My teaser pointed at the man beside him and gravely said , " Bark is the one who oils the screw . " " All right , man , " Daddy Chick said , " come down the ladder and get it . " The hog called Bark snapped his fingers in my man 's face , but willingly , with a stylized agility in the manner of yellow-trained slave acrobats , he spilled down the ladder , took the brush from Daddy Chick , made an ironic little kowtowing crouch to him , and squirreled up the ladder again . Hua , in the meantime , had moved facing me . He gave me , again , that deep look of curiosity , of interest , that was far more harrowing than chastisement . For an hour we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we became more natural in our timing , and everyone was chattering , and I asked Grin , " That Sun pig with the oil brush  --  what 's his name ? " " That 's Dolphin . " " Is he troublesome ? " " Look , child , that man is bad-disposed . Lank says he 's probably going wild ' one of these days . "  | " Wild ' ? To the mountain , you mean ? " " Hold your tongue , " Grin said in a low voice . Daddy Chick was walking toward the base of the press , not far from us . " You stupid little sow , " Grin said , when Daddy Chick had moved out of hearingagain , " you can kill a man with your loose mouth . " But I was not frightened by Grin . I was wondering : Would Dolphin always be on platforms ? My heart was still dancing ; laughter still pressed at my throat . For the first time in my slave life I had a clear-cut goal . An old uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby village , was always hanging about the Hua house and courtyard . For a yellow man he was a pathetic figure , nervous and Irritable , dry-skinned , a kind of beggar , one of those worthless derelicts of whom it is apt to be whispered , to account for their broken spirits , " He was disappointed in love when he was young , and he has never been the same since . " Such was not , in fact , his disappointment , but another , as I learned to my benefit one market day . I was idling alone in the courtyard , surrounded by the Huas ' pack of wonks . These mud-caked , scurfy dogs , who usually slunk about with their bushy tails between their legs , dodging clothshoedkicks , their eyes alert for flying stones , had , ever since this selfish Dolphin had dropped an old oil brush at my feet , seemed to me touching creatures , themselves something like slaves : the smallest sign of kindness raised their hopes to the skies . Old Uncle came into the courtyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs swirled about his legs , fanning the air with their tails , and he , poor man , feeling that even curs were against him , tried to drive them off . The dogs took his feeble thrashings for loving play , and they frisked all the more . I had learned how to calm them with a sedative clucking sound , and I did , drawing them off Old Uncle . He was as grateful for friendliness as one of them , and he began to chat with me . Soon he and I were seated side by side on the beam of a harrow , and somehow our random talk settled on Daddy Chick , and I happened to speak of the " touch-hog  --  tiger-eat " sign on the old slave 's hat that he wore on errands to town , and Old Uncle , withp330a sigh that seemed to come from the bottom of a water well , nodded and said he had written it for Hua . I remembered the crudeness of the characters on the hat sign . " Forgive me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write so beauti-fully . " " Do not have the air of a guest , " Old Uncle said . " Write ? Hai ! " As a boy he had been chosen by his family to be a scholar , he said . Scholarship , as I knew , was the path to yellow power and influence , because civil servants and officials of the Emperor 's court were chosen by competitive literary examinations . He had applied himself , he said , and he had " soared like a hawk . " He had memorizedthe great classics and had combed and caressed the art of essay writing . " I was the highest of seventeen selected from four hundred after the terrible four-day examinations at the perfectural town . Out of two hundred perfectural survivors I stood fourteenth in the examinations at Tsinan , the provincial city . The examinationslasted a fortnight . The hall was dark , and when it rained the roof leaked onto our essays . Four scholars died of cholera at their desks . One man , after writing for eighteen hours , stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literary chancellor beat him a hundred blows on his brush hand , and his characters then showed the pain , and of course he failed . In four years I passed the grades of hs'iu-ts'ai , lin-sheng , hung-sheng . I wore a brass button on my hat , and I was entitled to a semi-official robe and a title of respect . Then as a Selected Man I went to the NorthernCapital for the ministerial examinations . The morning essay was on a theme from Mencius , Like climbing a tree to catch a fish . ' I was aflame with ideas . The characters flew off my fingers like crickets . I would be a minister of the third rank , the second rank , I knew it . I had come from an East-of-the-Mountains village , and I was going to live in honored robes in the Forbidden City  --  I knew it . My poem in the five-character meter  --  the sounds , the tones , the meanings were all interwoven like brocade ! I transcribedexquisitely a passage , as required , from the Sacred Edicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last quarterhourgong . I went back to my lodgings and slept twelve hours . I was not afraid . I knew I was among the best . We had to wait two days . Then all the candidates went to the Examination Halls and waited and waited . At last they hung the boards . ' Of fifteen who passed , my name was fifteenth . I thought I would die with joy . I drank wine until I could not see . It cost me eight thousand cashp331to send a messenger to my father 's house in East-of-the-Mountains Province with the strip of red paper announcing to him that his son had achieved all that he wished . I had six hundred Joyful Announcements printed from woodcut blocks , proclaiming that I had placed fifth  --  everyone who passed exaggerated , most announcedthey had come out first . At the very moment I was paying for my lodgings to leave for home , where I would wait for my high appointment , whatever it might be , an Imperial constable came for me , and he took me before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had committed a terrible crime  --  cheating against His Imperial Blessedness . Not only had my name been removed from the boards , he said , but also all my ranks , down to hs'iu-ts'ai , were stripped from me , at the Emperor 's command . All my work , all , all , all ! I felt that I was in the grip of a nightmare , then the dream turned to utter madness . My protests were disallowed , and I was thrown out into the street like one of these yellow dogs . My repeated appeals for hearings were turned away . I could not believe this calamity . How could I go home to my father ? I lost my appetite . I never slept . I became as thin as a leper , and I shuddered and shivered morning and evening . I knocked daily at the chancellor 's gates , and always the watchmen set on me with staves . Then by accident , after four years of this deranged life , I learned what had happened . The youth who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so had not passed , was a son of a rich Northern Capital merchant , and it was he who had brought the accusation and the " proofs . " Now . Do you know the world ? I 'll tell you something . Some scholars did cheat . Oh , come , you little sow , did you think every magistrate was a pure scholar ? Look , there were three good plans . First : the little-box ' plan  --  the candidate padded his white silk vest with prepared essays . They were written on small sheets in fly-eye characters , you had to be keen to see them ! Or carried them into the examination in a false bottom in the basket of provisions he could take into the hall . Second plan , coin-honor . ' Buy essays from essay brokers . You could smell those men , they were like pimps  --  got posts as inspectors in the hail for the literary chancellor by graft . Third plan , transmission . ' Ayah , this was sporting ! Theme is assigned . Subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar outside . Scholar writes essay . Courier wads it carefully . Runs to wall . Gives signal  --  dog barking , or maybe peddler'sdrum with a certain beat . Throws wad over . Inspectorp332catches . Enters hall . Drops at candidate 's feet in passing . Candidatecopies . But listen , little sow . Those vultures picked my bones dry ! I had entered ' honestly ! I had never experienced such inspirationas during the examination ! I was innocent ! I was not a cash scholar ! The young number sixteen , the failure just behind me , who would replace me if I could be eliminated , had gathered witnesses ' : inspectors who could be bribed to sell essays could be bribed to slander . Even the literary chancellor had spoken against me and had ridden in a new carriage within a month . Ayah , listen , little sow , life is a cheat . Evil men connive against good men . It is all useless . Utterly useless . You are a slave , small sow . You know what I am saying . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A desiccated yellow hand patted mine , and silt-laden tears were flowing like the Yellow River down the dirty leathery cheeks , but I had a conviction that the old man had in fact cheated on every one of his examinations , from district town to Imperial Capital  --  how he had relished telling the three " plans " !  --  if , indeed , he had ever been a scholar at all . Yet my mind was racing . I saw a chance , and I knew its value . I asked the broken old man some questions to keep him prattling and , idly , as he talked , I took up a stick and scratched in the dust right at his feet the three-peaked character shan , " mountain , " which Smart had traced deeply into the cinders of my mind in the blacksmith shop at Yen 's : Old Uncle 's eyes fell on this meaning in the dust , and I thought I saw a flicker of surprise  --  but perhaps he thought that I had simply chanced upon the shape of this rather symmetrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressive characters , ma , for " horse , " mane flying , feet in motion , full tail swept downward . The old man stood up , his hands spread and patting the air as if to press down two impossibilities in one . This from a woman and a slave ! I looked up into his eyes , and I whispered , in tones halfwayp333between those of an imploring child and those of a seducer , " Will you be my teacher ? " He sat down hard on the tongue of the harrow , and I thought he would begin again to weep . To be a master of the classics ! For one who had gone for so many years from gate to gate of distant relatives to eke out a millet cake here and a bowl of bean curd there  --  to teach ! Swiftly there passed across the old uncle 's face , like the shadow of a crow flying between him and the honest sun , a brief look of such hate-laden craftiness that I was all the more convinced that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of self-betrayal . " We will have to get Hua 's wife on our side , " he said , speaking secretively and looking over his shoulders . Thus in one sentence he took cognizance of the strict laws against teaching slaves , of the basic gentleness of my mistress 's nature , of Hua 's rigidity , of the illiteracy of both master and mistress , of his own mendicant caution , of his passionate desire for a revenge on society , and of a sow 's best chance for safety in cheatingthe yellows . And so we worked up yet another " plan . " It took us three weeks to win Hua 's wife . We proceeded against her by what the old uncle called the " patient rice " method . " He has the longest meal who eats one grain at a time . " Act by rice-grain act , I gained her trust . Obeisance by minute obeisance , the old uncle reinforced her pity of him . Hua 's wife was a sturdy woman who , had she not lived in a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , she worked long hours , striving to rise above both self-pity and an ugly marginal life . I learned that her being more than a decade older than Hua was not remarkable ; generally in Shantung wives were older than husbands . ( Perhaps the Great Plague had taken more men than women from the province . ) This difference in age put a strain on her vanity and on her husband 's temptations  --  I had seen that look of interest in his eyes . Hua 's wife was outwardly subservient , compliant , obedient , yet she steered him as surely as if he were a plow . She smoked a brass-bowled pipe . Her feet had been well bound ( i.e. , ferociously )  --  and she bore her ambulantp334pain and their great " beauty " with an excess of pride . This , from the beginning , was her triumph over me  --  my enormous feet like dirty river sampans . Stray wisps of her stringy hair , which was supposed to be fastened in a bun behind , fell across her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands aside with the back of her hand . I was careful . Moth was my friend in the fields , but I shunned her in the house . I flattered Jasmine , Hua 's wife 's favorite , who was fond of herself . I put a strict end to the exultant swinging of my hips before men , before Hua himself , that thoughts of Old Sun 's Dolphin had induced . At last I found out something surprising : that Hua 's wife , too , wanted her revenge on life . When the old uncle asked permission to teach me some characters , on the grounds of giving him one last reason for being alive and giving me the capacity to keep Hua 's planting and harvesting records ( he having heard from the pigs , he told her , that I had already some rudimentary reading and writing ) , she responded by joining the conspiracy  --  we would trick her husband ; he should not know of the lessons until the girl was ready to be useful . I wondered , all of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regime of carefully scheduled meetings . Every trip Hua took to the district town was an occasion for a visit from the old uncle and for my being assigned to some " miserable work " on the loom or the wheel , while the other slaves were in the fields . for Hua 's wife thought it best to keep my lessons from the other pigs , for fear they might be envious of me ( and perhaps betray her to her deceived husband ) . For me , the thrills of a minor subversion !  --  to say nothing of the pure joy of preparing myself for a larger one . Among the yellows , learning meant power . I would never have power , but only by means of this wealth could I diminish , at least , my utter weakness . And my sips of the wonderful texts : The Four-Hundred-Names Classic ! The Thousand-Character Classic , in which not a single word was repeated ! The Analects , Great Learning , The Doctrine of the Happy Mean ! The old uncle possessed the books , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His method at first was to tease me with a glimpse at each masterpiece , then he started me on the more solid work of memorization . It was astonishing how muchp335he himself could remember , and although I was convinced that most human beings cheated their way through an unfair world , I could not explicitly tell whether Old Uncle had used " plans " to get through his examinations . He was in a way a fine teacher  --  he was enthusiastic . The promises he made for my future ! The Classic of Filial Piety ! Songs ! The Book of Changes ! Springs and Autumns ! But I was too excited and almost spoiled it all . With Hua 's wife 's knowledge I practiced writing in secret , whenever there was a chance , and one day I left my inkblock lying on the dirt floor beside the loom . Hua found it . Deeply stung perhaps because of his own illiteracy , he rooted around among us like an enraged wounded wolf ; he asked each slave many questions . I denied everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " If I ever catch you with a book , you filthy sow , or with an ink block and a brush , I 'll give you five hundred strokes of the heavier bamboo . I 'll cut you in two with it . I 'll have no pigs learning characterson my place ! If you give a hog the span of your hand he 'll steal the whole distance to the horizon . Do n't try to learn in my house , you turtle-spawning . " Hua 's wife moved calmly about while the farmer screamed at me . Her poise was terrifying . What treachery ! Wearily she swept the ends of hair from her face and said , " That baby sow has n't the brains to learn . I 'm sick of her . Get her out of here . " At once Hua puffed up his cheeks and then blew out the air  --  and with it , one felt , his rage . " It is probably Old Uncle 's inkblock , " I heard Hua 's wife placidly say as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor old magistrate . ' " This , in honor of his famous failure , is what people called the old uncle behind his back . " I 'll give that louse-bitten beggar the toe of my foot where he wo n't lose it , " Hua said , suddenly recovering his bad temper . The eighth day of the twelfth month was set aside by the yellows for worship , and Hua gave leeway to his slaves to go to Limestone Hill Generous Temple.  |p336In  the slave hut Daddy Chick praised our master for his liberality . " He is an old-pious , " he said . " I know slaves here and there who have to put their heads in jars in order to pray . " " Ayah , " said Lank in a cautious low voice , " you forever suck the master 's tit , Daddy Chick . When will you learn that it 's dry ? " I walked with Moth . The temple was on a hill six or seven li from Hua 's farm . The sunny day was chilly but not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife had supplied me with a quilted cotton tunic and trousers and a set of ankle bands . Along the road Moth and I were noisy . Daddy Chick said from his rearguardposition that our cackling was objectionable  --  it was the kind of behavior that would give the whites a bad name . " Pigs , " Grin said , meaning we already had one . I enjoyed Moth . In the fields we were fast friends , and she acceptedas a matter of course my being cold to her in the presence of Hua 's wife . She took delight in talking about Dolphin , sometimesteasing me and sometimes gravely coaching me in his seduction . With a fickle , undependable , arrogant man like him , Moth said , the best strategy was to alternate throwing oneself at him and scorning him . Stir up a cloud of dust ! We had finished picking and ginning , and Hua had twentyeightbales ; a good year , he counted it . The last few days we had been picking in the early mornings with frost on the bolls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept a small fire of trash going in the fields , and when Moth and I had been unable to stand our tender fingers any longer we would run and warm our hands awhile . Some days on the way out we had stolen turnips and when no one was looking had slipped them in the coals and on trips to the fire we had stirred them out and taken hasty bites of the hot black-encrusted turnip flesh . We could see the temple ahead on a hill scarred on one side by a quarry from which farmers took limestone for their fields ; two or three commonplace buildings within a wall . The exalted feature of the temple compound , as seen from the roadway , was an enormousweeping beech tree , which must have been hundreds of years old . It seemed to brood with animate sorrow over the follies of the temple  --  over the false promises given by idols and the credence given them by men and women with only a moment 's trot to death . Looking at the tree , I was suddenly frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying  --  reading and writing ;  |p337would  only earn me whip wales on my skin , and if for an unlikely moment I should catch selfish Dolphin he would slip from my grasp to that of another woman or to the mountain from which no slave returned . Yet when we climbed the hill and I saw , as we approached more closely , knots of slaves idling outside the temple walls  --  chatting , gambling , boxing , for all the world like the carefree groups at Yang 's tea-water well in the Northern Capital long before the oaths were sworn over the chalk circle  --  and when I noticed several men in the uniforms of Old Sun 's force , my cheerfulness returned with an actual physical surge , like a pang of acute hunger ; I rejected the weeping beech , as it were . I saw Dolphin ! He was waving his arms at some summit of narration , and he was wearing bright red trousers . Of the tactics Moth had urged on me , I quickly chose , for this day , the far easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's went inside to worship . This temple , crowded now with both yellows and slaves , was shabby . Gilt and paint were peeling from some of the divine images . We were herded into the special enclosure for slaves , behind a wooden partition taller than men , so that worshipping yellows would not have to look at us . The priests and monks considered us slaves a nuisance ; we had no coppers to spend on incense or paper money to be burned to the idols . A sweet smell of burning punk hovered in our slaves ' box . I was floating in a strange many-leveled mood : impatient to be finished with our worship so I could go out to Dolphin ; stung by the disdainful droning of the yellow-robed yellow monk with his wheel of supplications praying for us pigs from a platform in our enclosure ; frightened and awed by the grotesque figures of all sizes looming before us in an array of divinities banked up to the very roof beams of the dirty building ; inclined to skepticism but prudently hedging my doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could trust ; filled with vivid feelings of youth , eagerness , receptivity , fervor ; aware , as if of a weight on my back , of the huge mournful tree resting its arms on the tiles over my head . How transparent the monk 's warnings ! We must remember that Yu Huang , the Jade Emperor , was the author of slavery and the protector of the obedient . That Confucius ( a tuft of the **27;5907;TOOLONG beard had fallen away , leaving a sore of pitted clay in the compassionate face ) taught the duty , above allp338others , of respect . That running away was an offense concretely against the San Kuan , the three causes , rulers of heaven , earth , and water ; that the T'u Ti , the local constable god , would punish runaway slaves ; that the hog 's hard hands and white skin were marks of the displeasure of the three mythical emperors , Fu Hsi , Shen Nung , Huang Ti . And I ? I struck my forehead on the brick floor in honor of manyarmedTou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said to have a kind heart for the sufferings of humanity and could lead a slave to the mountain , and to certain of the Niang-Niang , the woman goddesses , who granted babies and protected a woman 's eyes and gave her regular periods , and to Ch'ung Wang , god of insects , praying that he would send blights and worms to Hua 's crops . While Moth and I were in the very act of kowtowing , close besideeach other , she nudged me with her elbow and whispered , " That 's enough . Let 's go . " We slipped out together , knowing that Daddy Chick would stay in the enclosure bowing and murmuring for nearly an hour . We walked straight toward Dolphin 's circle . Moth had her eye on a Sun hog named Quart . " When a man has a big nose , " Moth had said to me one day , talking of Quart , " you can be sure he has other big things , too . " When we had gone about half the distance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me grasp Moth 's upper arm . Her hair was matted , her face was long unwashed , her quilted jacket and trousers were torn and the filthy padding within was leaking out , so she seemed a frightful old stuffed doll that was losing its insides . But worst of all were her eyes , which had a piercing stare so like the prophetic one that Yen 's Peace had used to have that I immediately began to tremble . She was , I knew , a witch woman , a follower , in the face of strict prohibitions by the yellows in our province , of our old white-faced Jehovah . One or two of these fanatical witch women were forever lurking around temples rebuking the rest of us for accepting yellow gods , abusing us , laying down spells on us ; stirring in us , for all their absurdity , disquieting echoes of past beliefs and fears . The woman , her eyes glittering , said , " And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mouth of the false prophet ... '  | " Seven , eleven , go to heaven , " Moth said in the old language of the whites , to drive the witch out of our path . " Erh-lang will bite your arse , " I said , using one of the yellows ' exorcising curses , in the name of the Jade Emperor-god 's nephew , who was in charge of ghosts and spirits . Moth and I both sounded lighthearted , and we crowded past the awful woman . All the same , she had , like a whirling wind , lifted up a flying funnel of fallen leaves inside me . Slavery had long since seemed a triumph of the yellows ' many idols over the whites ' one God , and in the temple , shut away behind a wooden wall , even as I kowtowed , I had felt , through a deep unease and dissatisfaction , the essential hostility of the yellow-faced figures towering over me . On the one side of the wooden fence the yellows were thanking these figures for keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pathetically begging for change . For a moment I yearned for the deity of my dim , distant , tranquil Arizona pillow : Jesus , friend to little children , Be a friend to me ! But I saw Dolphin ahead , and all that distress promptly went under the surface . There were now about twenty slaves in Dolphin 's group , both men and women . They were standing a few paces from the lip of the limestone quarry . A thicket of juniper bushes and scrub pine straggled off down the hill behind the temple . There were other clumps of slaves all around the compound  --  so many ! Moth and I pushed our way into the group , until she was beside Quart and I was next to Dolphin ; my shoulder jarred against his arm , and he looked down at me . " What 's going on ? " I asked him . " Ayah , it 's little Fall-Down ! " he said , and he put an arm around my waist and pulled me to his flank , tucking me under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest through his quilts and mine . " Have you learned how to walk yet ? " " Have you learned how to hold on to an oil brush ? " I put on as impertinent a face as I could manage . Dolphin laughed , but then he turned his attention away from me and back to the exchanges of the group . Dolphin , Quart , and three or four other men were arguing about something or other.  |p340Dol|phin  kept his arm around me but seemed to have forgotten that I was there . Shortly a hog of the Sun force pushed his way into the group , which was growing all the time as the quarreling voices rose to a louder and louder pitch , and he tapped Dolphin on the far arm and whispered in his ear . Dolphin grunted , removed his arm from my waist , and started to turn away . Then , apparently as an afterthought , he turned back , swung his arm over my head , and pulled me with him in an embrace . " Come on , baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to see to help her grow up . " So , tightly held , I was swept along across a hump of the hill into a smaller band of slaves , perhaps six men and three women , who were standing at the edge of the low-lying thicket of evergreens . When Dolphin came up some of the others exchanged with him several rapid whispers . I heard Dolphin ask , " Where ? " A woman made a motion with her head and eyes , indicating that whatever they were discussing lay hidden within the thicket . " Let 's go , " Dolphin said . One , two , or three at a time , the slaves in the little party broke off , with looks up the hill toward the back of the temple to make sure no one was watching , and ducked into the cover of the pines . Dolphin released me , but when he started in , he flapped his hand , commanding me to follow him . Fifty paces within the thicket we came on the others . They were standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I took my place beside Dolphin in the ring I saw the object of the quest . On his hands and knees , taking cover under the bush , was a beast of a white man  --  bearded , long-haired , tattered , foul , thin , and hollow-eyed . Yet at his lip curled a smile and in his eyes lurked a jewel-light so serene , so contemptuous of all of us , that I suddenlyfelt a catch at my throat and found that I was weeping  --  for what ? For this miserable fortunate man ? For all of us ? For slaves ? For myself  --  noticed by Dolphin but not really seen by him ? For worshippers , idolaters , God 's witch women , anyone who hoped for anything ? Dolphin reached under his quilted jacket and pulled out three cakes of millet bread and tossed them on the ground between the boar 's hands . Another slave reached down with a flitch of bacon . A third placed a small earthen jar , presumably of salt , on the ground . A fourth undid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to scratch his private parts , instead pulled outp341with a guttural laugh a cloth bag of flour that had been hanging within from his cinch ; holding up his pants with one clutching hand , he put down the small sack with the other . The boar 's dirty claws scooped up the pieces of bread that Dolphin had tossed on the ground , and settling back on his hams the wild free man began to gnaw at one of the hard cakes . His hunger was like a dog 's . He trembled as he ate . We waited until he had finished one of the cakes . Then three of the men , including Dolphin , knelt and murmured confidentially with him . He nodded . Under the ferocious , wild , unkempt outer face of the boar there was a look , which tortured me to the edge of tears again , of intelligence , tranquillity , and compassion for us who were slaves . We left him there . Perhaps Dolphin and the others had planned future rendezvous with him . We emerged by the temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a daze . Moth , who was thrilled by the thought that Dolphin had taken me into the thicket for interesting reasons , teased me all the way . I did not tell her what I had seen ; I tried to play up to her gossipy excitement . At the Huas ' we all dined on la pa chou , " winter-sacrifice congee , " the delicacy reserved for this day of the year  --  dates , chestnuts , jelly , fruits , good things to the number of eight , mixed into a kaoliang gruel . Hua 's wife had decorated the bowls with designs of birds and flowers made of bits of fruit . We slaves were given each a taste , and as the delicious mixture melted on my tongue I closed my eyes and saw again the tattered free man under the juniper bush gnawing like an animal on the dry millet cake . At the first series of days with heavy frosts , the Huas held a swine-killing . Grin and Jasmine , whose daily extra chore had been the feeding of Hua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter and feasting . So skilled was Grin at the split-second work of slaying and cleaning the animals that Hua himself remained in the background , and at times , if a big hog got loose when we were catching him to kill him , or if a piece of hoisting equipment appeared to be on the point of giving way while a carcass was being lifted , wep342were treated to the spectacle of a slave giving urgent commands to his master , which the owner obeyed with alacrity . But Grin was no threat to our master . Grin 's temperament was lax , and but for the strength of Jasmine he would have been a shiftless man , or a drinker , or simply a groveling shame of accommodation . Grin had , however , certain specific skills , which were developed to a high degree . Swine-killing was one of them , and under his direction the two days of this work became a festival  --  or so the entire household except for me seemed to regard it . Every moment of the festival was , to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves filled me with revulsion . I loathed the very words " pig , " " hog , " " sow , " " piglet , " meaning slave , meaning creature with white skin , meaning myself , Dolphin , Moth , Perfection , even defenseless Tender ; connoting our skin , our filth , our disgusting greediness , our degradation , our grunting speech and clumsy feet , our " bad eyes , " our light and often curling hair , our hopeless single fate : to fatten our owners . The men hauled out two enormous caldrons , filled them with water , and placed one of them over an ogre-throated fire in a pit , and erected above the pair of kettles a tripod of bamboo poles as thick as thighs . Now the process of catching and killing began , and Jasmine , Moth , and I had to help . We were within the mud-walled swine wallow ; the footing was slime . The swine seemed to know what was in store for them , and they ran here and there at hurtling speeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grimaces of an all-or-nothing athlete . With each lunge or dive we made , muddying ourselves like the animals we were trying to catch , Moth flew into cascades of laughter . But my only inclination to laugh was at a bitter incongruity : I was a devoted student , at the time , of The Doctrine of the Happy Mean , and I was reduced to tackling swine in their own element  --  playing at pig-catch-pig . Yet hog-kill-hog was far worse . Once caught , the swine commenceda screaming that mimicked the extremities of human terror . Grin with flying fingers roped the kicking knuckles , and Lank and Daddy Chick hoisted the creature , who kept shrieking for sympathy from any who might be called pig in this world , onto a shoulder pole and jogged around to the blood pans in back of the swine hut , and there Grin would cut off screeches and life with a single perfect axe stroke . Relief and pity . Fellow pig !  |p343Each  time new squeals for help arose I thought , for some reason , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed our help , his silent eyes had pleaded for help ; but we had needed his help , because he was free , and I thought I had seen a kind of scream in selfish Dolphin 's eyes ! Yes . Dolphin wanted to run away . I knew that . I was in a desperate fool 's race . Try to win him in time to lose him . When the prime animals were dead and bled , Grin attached the carcasses , one at a time , to a hook at the foot of a system of blocks attached to the bamboo tripod . By this time the water in the great caldron on the fire was boiling . Grin would hoist each body over the caldron , let it down into the scalding water just long enough to loosen the bristles , raise it again , and drop it into the other kettle of cool water beside the pit . From there Hua , Lank , and Daddy Chick lifted the corpse with grappling irons and hung it from a crude bamboo frame , under which Hua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked with scrapers to remove the bristles . These , of course , were kept  --  to be sold for hairbrushes for fine ladies in faraway splendor . I thought of Big Madame Shen 's table of cosmetic marvels  --  and of the night when I tried on her exquisite clothes ; I was caked now with the mud of a wallow . But mostly , as I scraped and scraped at the tough pig hides , which had gone from pink to deadest white in the scalding water , I thought about skin . White skin . My fate in the color of my skin . I looked more than once at the skin on my arm , and the sight filled me with an impotent spirit of revolt ; I raged , for want of a more suitable target , at the swine , and I clawed at the stubborn bristles with an energy that brought a quiet word of praise  --  increasingmy fury  --  from Hua 's wife . " You are an industrious small child , " she said , belittling me as she applauded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her arm was yellow . After the pallid skins were cleaned the men brought big gut trays and they slit the carcasses and cleaned out the vitals ; and as the afternoon waned Jasmine , Moth , and I were submitted to the final indignity : we had to clean the bowels of their feces for the sake of the chitterlings and casings . This was too much for Hua 's wife , who did the less nauseating work of separating out hearts , kidneys , livers , and lights . All these parts we placed for the time being in tubs of salt water , and , still stinking , I rehearsed in my memory the tranquil opening passages of The Happy Mean !  |p344It  grew dark , and we carried the carcasses into the courtyard , where , behind locked gates , we laid them out on bamboo racks through the freezing night . The next morning Grin , wielding dangerous knives and cleavers as if they were sources of delight  --  as if they were fiddle bows , gong beaters , and tappers for jade sweet-sounding tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us salted the meat . On trays and salting benches we laid out the leaf lard , the hams , the shoulders , the heads , the twinkling feet  --  no shred to be wasted . The bones were set aside to be boiled . While the men rubbed salt onto the large cuts , we women sat at wooden blocks with hatchetlike choppers , and we diced the inferior meat to be pickled . Hua 's wife tried the fat out from certain portions , and the fragrance of the sizzling lard hung about our heads . The children flocked around us begging for mouthfuls of crisp , for pigtails to roast in the ashes of Hua 's wife 's fire , and for bladders to blow up as balloons rattlingwith a few beans inside . They ran about , white and yellow , pounding each other over the heads with these blown-up bladders and squealing at their fun . Did the little whites slap the little yellowswith an extra force of childish revenge ? I thought not . It was I who applied with my white-skinned hand an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honor of my frustration . When all the meat that mattered was in salt or in barrels of brine we were offered a feast of bits : of spare bones and backbones , jowls and feet , tripe and chitterlings , with a gruel of kaoliang and white cabbage . It was a rare night when so much was set before a slave . " What is the matter , small child ? " Hua 's wife asked me . " Why do n't you stuff yourself ? " " I 'm too tired to eat , " I said . I was , once again , on the edge of tears , at the thought of pig-eat-pig . Yet ten days later my heart was as light as a thrush 's voice . It was the day before the yellows ' New Year , and Old Sun had invited masters and slaves from the entire district to a celebration , and I knew that I would see Dolphin . The morning flew . Hua was talkative ; he was pleased with hisp345crop , and in general we were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . He affixed new couplets , rather grand for our style of life , to the doorposts , in black characters on strips of red paper : PEACE TO THE COUNTRY ESTATE ; TRANQUILLITY IN THE MANY CHAMBERS . Hua 's wife pasted up a new picture of the kitchen god , to signal his return from his annual report to heaven , and she spread sesame stalks in the courtyard on which the old year could secretively tiptoe away . She gave each slave a pair of new cloth shoes . We were excused to the slave hut to dress ourselves for the celebration at Old Sun 's . I had nothing but my quilted field coat and trousers to wear , but Moth drew from her poor bundle of possessions two new cotton scarves , brightly printed with patterns of butterflies and cicadas , and she threw one over my shoulders . " If you do n't wear something new on your back on New Year 's , " she said , " the wild birds will shit on you all year long . " Then with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by folding red , black , green , and gold papers , which she had somehow acquired , in intricate patterns , cutting designs into them , and then unfolding them  --  lace , combs , jade earrings , gold flowers ! Seeing us decked with these cheap jewels , Lank sourly commented , " Two whores  --  one 's a fool because she let herself get pregnant . " All the same , I could tell by the way he looked at us that we did not appear quite so hardened as he said . Going over to Old Sun 's , all of us , even Hua and his wife , walked barefoot , cold as it was , with our new shoes clamped under our arms to keep them clean , and our hands tucked into our sleeves  --  as if having one set of extremities warm would prevent the others from getting too cold . On the way our path passed through the humped barren field where dead slaves from all the estates of , the countryside were buried under paltry mounds  --  like sea waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean from the slave ship East Garden , unmonumented , unmarked , indistinguishable one from another ; I thought for a moment of the burial of poor Kathy , killed by her bondage to that mad humanity-hating carpenter in the Capital . This moment of dark thoughts , however , passed ;  |p346Moth  , sensing the chill I was having , took me by the hand and broke into a run , and she pulled me with her out of the graveyard . We waited beyond for the others to catch up . Outside the wall of Old Sun 's main courtyard we all stopped and put on our shoes , and then we were ready . The road before the compound gate was crowded with guests , yellow and white , who were arriving on foot , on carts , on mulebackand donkeyback riding double and triple . There were three carriages by the gate in which rich men must have brought their families . The slaves were all wearing whatever scraps they could set their hands on that were new and colorful  --  red-paper hats , multicolored ribbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few cash interwoven with ribbons into the shapes of dragons . We entered the gate . The yellow guests were bidden to cross the verandas and enter the central hall ; the whites were relegated to the large back courtyard , where they were to be left outdoors in the cold . On the lintel of the gate into this courtyard was pasteda New Year 's inscription : THE BOND SERVANT FINDS HEAVEN-JOYIN DUTY . No matter ! Three hundred slaves , or more , some in the uniformsof prosperous masters , others , like us , in threadbare quilts , were assembled in the open space , and there was much raucous shouting and uncouth loud laughter . Trestle tables had been set up , covered with sheets of red paper . Crude paper flowers and decorations were displayed on the window grilles and door frames . Here and there characters on red paper proclaimed all those things that slaves would never have : happiness , wealth , good fortune , longevity , and peace of mind . Moth found Quart , in a runner 's uniform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around Moth and lifted her off the ground , and then he hugged me , too , pressing me hard to his body . Thinking that Moth might not like this , and finding that I did , I was embarrassed , and I blushed , and my blush made me furious . I was in the midst of this confusion when Dolphin came striding up , in a tunic like Quart 's but again sporting his red trousers , which he apparently wore on festive days , and he said , " Hai ! Fall-down ! You look like a magistrate 's concubine ! Have you a little mouse for me ? " ( Now " mouse , " as I well knew from Moth , was the expression white slaves used at that time for the dark , hairy thing at thep347base of a woman 's belly  --  as well as for the co-operative use to which she could sometimes be persuaded to put it . ) For Lank to call me names was one thing ; from Dolphin this rude talk came much harder . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him the one word " Rooster ! " because of his crimson pants and rutty tongue , and I bit my lip , turned my back on him , and on an impulse ( at the root of which Moth 's advice on tactics my well have lain , though I felt angry ) I walked swiftly away , losing myself in the crowd . But then I was at a loss what to do . I knew no one . I stoodawkwardly among chatting groups . I tried to pretend that I was paying close attention to this and that . I hoped Dolphin would not see me floundering this way . I was rescued by a loud gong at the courtyard gate . Here cameOld Sun in a crimson hat and brocaded robes ! All the slaves in the courtyard fell to their knees and kowtowed . The old man keptnodding and flapping his hands to us as if dripping water off his fingertips . He spoke a few words , which I could not hear , in acracking voice , and all stood up . Slaves lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he presided over the giving of it cheap gifts : shoddy hats , fragile pipes , bits of ribbon , trashy scarves like the one Moth had given me  --  so this was how she had acquired hers in the first place ! Near Old Sun 's feet , besides , were several huge clay jars , as high as a man 's waist , full of spirits distilled from a millet mash , and this liquor was dealt out indiscriminately to the slaves as they came forward for their presents . I received a cow-horn comb and almost choked on a single sip of the drink ; it reminded me of " Uncle " Ch'en 's nightmarish pleasure garden , whence I had been sold out of South-of-the-River Province . During the giving of gifts various slaves , who were thought , or considered themselves , eloquent , stood up and made florid speeches , squealing in the falsetto tones of itinerant actors , in praise of the senile miser sitting on the throne at the top of the yard . Old Sun nodded at each hypocritical flattery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise . Dolphin came up to me with a bowlful of the millet liquor and offered it to me , and like a fool I gulped it all down , cupping my hands tenderly over Dolphin 's in a pretense of steadying the bowl . The brew burned me right to my belly as it went down , and I feltp348wild , and wildly I turned once again and strode away from Dolphin . This time he followed me ; I soon felt a strong hand clamped to my upper arm . " Not so fast , you little sparrow . Come on . Let 's go up near the platform ; they 're going to have games . " I was dizzy from the liquor . I shook off Dolphin 's hand . " Leave me alone , " I said , " you . . . you centipede ! " This wooden epithet from the traveling slave-players ' stock roster of villains made Dolphin throw his head back and roar with laughter . My silliness vexed me ; I was filled up with false emotion , and with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of stalking haughtily away from him for the third and last time , I flung myself on his chest . His arms closed tightly around me , and I heard him laughing in my hair , " You stupid little sow ! " With his arm around my shoulders Dolphin pulled me up into the thick press of slaves around the platform . Old Sun had been carried off , and two jugglers were hurling and swinging five firetippedtorches back and forth ; the flames somersaulted and caracoled . For the better part of two hours I leaned , half drunk , in a paralysisof tongueless bliss , against Dolphin 's side . The noisy crowd forced us against each other . Dolphin 's hand was at my waist , and now and then , at the sight of an acrobat 's masterful passage with a foot shuttlecock , or at the sudden lifting of a weighted beam , on the third desperate try , by a strong-man slave , or at a conjurer 's making an entire living pheasant disappear into thin air , converting it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand palpably increased . All my slave 's life melted into the mind-numbing contentment of this unreal place , this unbelievable pressure . In all the time he spoke to me only once . " So you belong to Dirty Hua ? " Was this what Sun 's slaves called my master ? I nodded . Then suddenly there was a commotion , some shouting back and forth , and he was gone . I felt a panic . Dolphin was going to be exactly what I had judged  --  selfish , ruthless , and indifferent to the feelings of others . He would pick me up and drop me , like a twig , whenever he wanted . Now bareknuckle boxing began , and Dolphin appeared in the fourth bout . I was relieved : he must have been called away from my side.  |p349He  fought unshod and stripped to the waist , in just his red trousers , and all across his back I saw long ugly welts . He won his match and was given a dipperful of millet liquor as a prize . He came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cheek was turning dark . " How was I ? " he asked , with a conceited leer . " They have beaten you , " I said . " Ayah , baby , " he said , facing the platform and putting his arm around me again , " I 'm not going to let them do that to me any more . " A slave gave a demonstration of sending a bird into the air to catch seeds that the man tossed up . The bird 's foot was tied by a string . I felt very close to the bird , as if it were another self of mine . Its feats were miraculous ! It had learned to turn right over in the air ( did the slave jerk the string ? ) , to glide , to catch three seeds at one attempt . The whites in the crowd cheered , whistled , and hooted with pleasure , and the bird seemed to nod and bow at the applause . Yes , the slaves made all sorts of joyful noises  --  and yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layer of smoke , that hung over all our heads ? The applause was false , the laughter was false , my own melting luxurious warmth of contact with this man who was always on my mind  --  that , too , would play me false . This was a celebration in honor of a new year , which could bring us nothing but worse . How strange it was that we could express our sorrows through cheers , our utter hopelessness through gales of mad laughter ! " Baby , baby , " Dolphin said , " this is no day for that . " I realized I was weeping . Then , evidently understanding my pain-in-pleasure , showing a hint of bottomless grief himself on his face with its now livid bruise , Dolphin said in a soft voice , holding me tighter than ever , " Bastard sons of turtles ! " Darkness fell . Sun slaves lit lanterns all around the courtyard . Old Sun gave us a stingy feast  --  pork meat , kaoliang gruel , white cabbage ; what we called white man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " What can you expect from Venerable for three hundred hungrybellies ? " Quart said , rising to the defense of his master . When it was time for us to go home , Hua bought for a few cash from a peddler at Sun 's gate a handful of pine splits with big knots at the top , and we lit the sap-filled knots , and our procession ofitp350smoky flares made a long sulphurous glowworm going through the fields . I was light of step . I felt that in the easy flow of my feelings toward the man I had begun to think of as mine I had found at last the secret of survival for one who was white in a yellow world . We stayed up in the slave hut till the arrival of the New Year , talking about the many colors of the day . When Hua struck a gong at midnight , we went up to the house and removed the sesame stalks from the courtyard , to avert bad luck from the family , and yellows and whites together kowtowed toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year long . Hua felt complacent about his crop , stacked in the safe godown of Old Sun , and he honored the traditional period , from the new moon of the New Year to the full moon that followed , of a thorough suspension of work . But for the daily chores to keep the animals and fowl alive , and to get the cooking and washingof the household done , we were relieved of all labor . Grin hunted ; he shot his long-watched weasel . Jasmine mended her family 's clothing . Daddy Chick sat all day in the door of the slave hut playing his fiddle and dozing . Lank , armed with written chits authorizing visits to nearby farms , spent whole days in the traditional pastime of the New Year layoff : gambling , mainly with dominoes made of bamboo ; he grew thinner and more morosethan ever . Hua 's wife 's mei-mei , her younger sister , visited us , and our mistress wanted to show how aristocratically one could live with ten souls in the slave quarters . " Mel-mei wants a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick and wrap it in cotton cloths and carry it to the mei-mei and kowtow after I tucked it under her tiny blood-starved feet . But several days Moth and I , wearing cedar twigs wrapped in our hair in the belief that they would protect our bodies from lice , got chits from Hua to visit Old Sun 's . Moth was tired of Quart and had taken up with a humorous hog nam.ed Second ; her pregnancy was by now thoroughly noticeable , but nobody seemed to be put off by it , and men still sought and enjoyed her company . And I ? I spent the whole layoff softening Dolphin 's heart by devious means . For instance : Moth told me that a pinch of dust from a woman'sp351footprint sprinkled in a man 's food would make the man 's private . parts itch unbearably in desire for that woman alone . It took me three visits to Old Sun 's and a great deal of fatuous byplay to get a few grains of dust from one of my own footprints into a bowl of cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crowd of itinerant salesmen that was forever milling about the side gate of the Sun compound , where Sun 's housekeepers did their buying , I bought , with two cash I had stolen from Hua 's wife 's bag of kitchen coppers , a piece of root from the plant called never-shame-weed , and I kept a small piece of it in my mouth and chewed it whenever I was near Dolphin , for this was said to provide an irresistible magnetism . I played , as well as I could , Moth 's game of offer-and-snatchaway . I had no inkling how my efforts were succeeding until the holidayscame to an end , on the evening of the full moon , with the Lantern Festival . We had learned that the Sun slaves had organized a procession that would go from farm to farm that night to entertain yellow masters of the countryside ; we supped early and cleaned up and waited . In the distance , at last , we heard , coming across the lanes in the fields from the direction of Old Sun 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet timbrels , and short strings of firecrackers , and running outside Hua 's walls we saw a sparkling celebration creeping towards us  --  lanterns held high on poles and flaming pine knots weaving about , and at the heart of the beautifultrain , a long , writhing , cloth-backed dragon with many caperingand dancing human legs . Barley Flower and Perfection wanted to run into the fields to join the thrilling parade ; Hua struck his oldest child a flat blow on the head to give her better sense . Cart Tongue , Stone , Tale , and Tender jumped up and down and squealed with excitement at the magical apparition , and in this they acted for Moth and me ; we wanted to leap and chirp , too . As the procession came near , we fell into our proper places  --  Hua and his family in the front rank , to be entertained , we slaves behind , " in attendance . " The dragon , the light-bearers , and the accompanying noisemakersand performers stopped on the worn , grassless square of ground between Hua 's gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torches a group of slave athletes performed , wheeling around a female contortionist , whose knots of limbsp352and grinning glances at us from between her own legs made me slightly queasy , as at the sight of a double deformity  --  body and skin both unacceptable . There followed , to the beat of the timbrels , a yang ho , or sprout song , in the haunting whole-tone scale of the yellows , to which its performers soberly danced charades  --  and I thought of the mute planting in the Arizona manner danced for me , and for me alone , by that red-eyed tipsy man in Chao-er 's tavern so long before . The performances were over . The dragon , which had been standing by in a drooping condition , now heaved up its cloth flanks , and its head , built up in fantastic lacquered intricacies of ferocity , began to waggle , and the noisemakers all began to bong and rattle , and the long form  --  thirty men 's worth , at least  --  resumed its twisting dance . The lanterns and the dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described one full circle , seemed all at once to hesitate . Then it turned toward us of the house of Hua . Its head dipping and yawing , it advanced in our direction . It came past the Huas . I began to have the strangest feelings . On one side of me Moth retreated toward the gate with little feminine half-laughing shrieks , and on the other side the squad of Jasmine 's children also fell to rout . Rooted in I-knew-not-what audacity , I stood ground alone . The dragon came to me . The noise seemed deafening now . Confronting me so closely , the huge paper head , trailing spiral paper snorts out of its nostrils and blinking its warrior eyes with lashes of pig bristle , seemed not fearful but buffoonish , clumsy , playful , and charged with overwhelming lust . The head dipped before me . It bowed to the ground . Abandoning all ferocity , it nuzzled its cheek in the dust toward Hua 's wife 's consolation , my ugly slave feet . I believe I was blushing all over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , constantly rocking and nodding , lifted up , and waggling its fang-studded lower jaw up and down in a dragon 's chomping grin , it began a series of marvelous leaps into the air . With these leaps I saw that the legs under the head were encased in bright red trousers . My feelings , as the dragon crawled away to the ditchlike road , were in a swirling confusion like that of the procession itself . Dolphin , human engine in the dragon 's head , had singled me outp353before the entire gathering , and I should have felt , I partly did feel , the keenest delight I had ever known . But beneath and within the delight , I felt disgust and anger . Why should this man upon whom I had fastened my hopeless self submit himself to this indignity , to entertain a few yellow masters , cavorting through the countryside wrapped in a papier-mache bestiality ? Yet . . . Better to be the head than a meaningless segment farther back ! Yet . . . What had happened to us ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had seen Dolphin taking his cheap gift from Old Sun 's hand on the day before the New Year : humble . How had stiff backbones become so flexible : moral strength became a willingnes to kowtow ? No , no , what had happened to this Dolphin was insupportable . He worshipped , as we all did , in the yellow temple , and his faith , if he had any , was fatalistic , and fatalism brought out strange traits  --  selfishness , lasciviousness , and an urge to martyrdom . I felt a struggle within me , at the very moment when I might have burst with joy , a struggle between submission and rebellion , giving and stealing , resigning myself and hardening myself . Death of the soul , or the mountain ! Take the easy way with Dirty Hua , or  --  or what ? Why did the dragon not carry me off ? Moth was whispering and giggling about my ears . " You 've got him , " I heard her murmur . " Take him out in the fields some night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixteenth of the first month , our master went off with five carts , four of them rented from skinflint Sun , taking lank and Grin as extra carters , to carry his twenty-eight bales of cotton to market . As they set off , with a basket of food for four days cooked by Jasmine , and with two of the donkeys in their cart shafts tied by their bridles to the carts ahead , so the three men could manage five carts , Hua was in high spirits : this was the best crop he had ever raised , and his wife 's mei-mei , whom he clearly disliked , as an extra mouth for both eating and talking , had gone home , and  --  ayah , he was fifteen years younger than his dry-necked wife , and he was going for an unsupervised sojourn in the district capital.  |p354Lank  and Grin were excited , too  --  Lank by the prospect of having the measly cash that he had won from country card players eased away from him by city gamblers with drooping eyelids and honeyed fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the taverns and telling townsmen of the low-bellied , razor-fanged beasts he had stalked and bagged . How brave , each in his own vein , those three seemed to think themselves ! In their absence Daddy Chick was in charge of us . He loved his flimsy authority so much that he grew befuddled , and went around clearing his throat and shifting us arbitrarily from task to task  --  knocking down and burning the dead cotton plants ; bringing in the kaoliang stalks , which had a hundred uses , from fencing to fuel ; hauling out rotted cotton seed , ginned from the old crop , for fertilizer ; marking out the plow lines ; and patching the walls of both houses with straw-bound mud , which we dug from the pits where , on the day of my arrival , I had seen yellow and white children playing like blood kin . In these days I saw something remarkable : Hua 's wife at a wooden plow , listing the kaoliang fields for the new planting . In the absence of her man , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , powerful , stone-jawed . She ripped the bowels of the earth in lines as straight as bees ' flight ... . Moth and I were alone , storing kaoliang stalks in a drying rick hung from the rafters of the work space in the Hua house . She was in a confidential mood . " Do you know why they call him Dirty Hua ? " " " Why ? " " I 'm telling you this for your own good . He 's like all the yellow men . Do n't let him touch you . Listen , small flower , never let a yellow man touch you in that way . Hua has this curiosity  --  he 's like the rest of them  --  this curiosity about us . He thinks we 're different  --  better  --  whenit comes to . . . you know what I mean . All these yellow men want a white woman  --  do you know why ? They have heard about the romantic idea that the whites are supposedto use  --  they think we use it  --  like some sort of tickler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or like a fascinatingposition . Hush , dear ; Dirty Hua  --  I call him that , too !  --  why should n't I ?  --  he told me all this . Shhh ! He says he ca n't help himself , he says he has to learn about this Idea that isp355supposed to make the white people almost explode  --  down there  --  you know what I mean  --  when they do it together  --  the Idea getting into that place and making it different  --  better . Listen . I 'll have to whisper . He 's quite cute . He 's very polite when he tries to find the Idea inside there , only he 's scared to death . He 's afraid he wo n't have the Idea in  --  or on  --  his own  --  well , you know  --  and so he wo n't be as good as the white men . And , being afraid , he is n't . He just is n't . I swear he is n't as good . And then he gets in a terrible heat to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the Idea was nonsense  --  we do n't do it with our heads  --  it 's just that slaves have no other way to be wild except that way : he wo n't accept that . He wo n't let you alone . He also thinks we 're made differently  --  you know where I mean  --  and he wants to investigate . It gets disgusting . He is dirty . Listen , my mei-mei , keep him off you . Treat him like a biting fly . Slap him hard . I 'm telling you for your own good . " Both Moth and I were blushing like two angry girls . In a shocked voice I said , " Then he is the father . " " I do n't know . " Moth was suddenly wringing her hands and appealing for help no one could give her . " That 's the worst of it . I do n't know . " It made no difference anyway , because a white woman 's child was always her responsibility . The Imperial courts had long since held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's father , whoever he might be . Moth must have known this ; probablyshe was terrified of Hua 's wife . " But that 's not why they call him Dirty Hua , " Moth said , recoveringsuddenly and solidly from her discomfiture . " Then why do they ? " " Because of this , " Moth said , opening her arms to the squalor of the crowded work space . " Those Sun hogs are used to satin and lacquer . Second says to me , Do you have good mud in that wallow you Hua pigs live in ? ' " " But Hua works ! " I said . " He works in the fields . " " I know , child . But that is no reason not to call him Dirty . " " I 'm not trying to defend him , " I said rather sharply  --  though in truth I had a feeling of protective anger on our master 's behalf , and this had made me disgusted with myself , even a little alarmed , and short with Moth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him dirty means that they think you and I are dirty too . "  | " Ayah ! We are ! " There was no answer to that . We were . I felt bad-tempered all the rest of that day . Everything Moth had said about Hua upset me . Five days passed and Hua did not return . Six days . Seven . Eight . As if bad weather had set in , we gave up all pretense of hard work and huddled nervously in the main courtyard . On the evening of the ninth day we heard carts drawing off the road in front of the courtyard , and Daddy Chick , Jasmine , Moth , and I rushed out and gave our master a welcome the warmth of which was wholly false . We kowtowed , rushed about helping with the donkeys , and gave Hua many flowery expressions of our gratitude at his safe return . Hua and his two men had empty carts and long faces . We had expected Hua to bring provisions and gifts back from the city . I heard Jasmine say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough . What kind of game were you hunting , man ? Mice ? " When we entered the house I saw that Hua 's wife , too , was furious with her husband over the length of his sojourn in the city . She and Jasmine seemed to attribute their husbands ' gloominessto shame and remorse . But our master soon set the women straight as to that . " It 's a disaster , " he said , with haggard well-pouched eyes . " You should have seen the cotton ! Every man in the whole district was out on the road with the best crop in a thousand years . Carts piled twice as high as ours , till half of them overturned when they tried to get out of the ruts . Pole boats on the rivers stacked with bales twelve tiers high . Every man in East-of-the-Mountains Province was suddenly a planter , merchant , comprador , factor , all talking cotton , cotton . Suffocating ! The godowns were vomiting cotton before we even reached the city . I thought we would never sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a price that ruins me . Last year we got forty-eight taels of silver for a four-hundred-catty bale . This year the official price is twenty-six taels . I got twentytwo . Ai ! It costs me eight taels a year to feed a pig . " The last word he spat out at us , his slaves . This was the beginning of a change in our master.  |p357I  was as happy as a slave could ever be . Day and night , daring thoughts of Dolphin pushed much that was evil and ugly out of my mind . I saw him one morning at Limestone Hill Generous Temple . He was brusque with me , but I perceived in his eyes and around his mouth telltale signs which gave me all I needed for encouragement . I was determined , for his sake , not to be a dirty pig of Dirty Hua  --  to be as close to satin and lacquer as louse bedding and tung oil could make themselves . Some of my efforts to become attractive were , as I came eventually to realize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves the idea that the black , coarse , and straight hair of yellow women was " good " hair , and anything unlike it was " bad " hair . Mine , being brown , fine , and inclined to curl when damp , was " bad , " and I now bought from an itinerant vendor at Old Sun 's side gate one of the many hair dyes for white women that these scoundrelpeddlers foisted off on us . It consisted , I am afraid , of lard and soot perfumed with a few petals of nicotiana . This stuff made me exactly what I wanted to avoid being  --  filthy . It came off on my clothes and on our communal k'ang . Daddy Chick called me a chimney-head . When I perspired in the fields the preparation ran down my neck and forehead . But I was sure that I was more attractivethan before . Lank said in his sour way , " Do you have a good ' little mouse , too , baby ? " I had a traveling barber pierce my ear lobes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black beans and silver thread . I wore tight shoes and hobbled like a woman with bound feet . We had a common saying that a white man who would not steal had jade toenails . One day Dolphin went into the woods on Sun 's place with Quart , and they waded into the walled swamp where Old Sun kept a herd of half-wild swine , and they stole a fat shoat , killed it , and hid it in the woods under some dead leaves . At night they went out and found it and carried it behind the wall of the slave village on the great estate , and they dressed it there , burying thep358offal . They put the salted meat in earthenware jars , and they buried them , too , and marked the place . This much Dolphin told me  --  whispering in my ear as Moth , Second , he , I , and several other Sun slaves were seated crosslegged on Dolphin 's own k'ang one evening . Moth and I had slipped away over the fields without a chit , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to stay the night with them , but we were too afraid . A few mornings later , on the second day of the second month , when , each year , the water dragon , who controlled insects , was supposed to rouse himself from his winter sleep , Jasmine , Moth , and I were instructed by Hua to propitiate the dragon , so he would not infest us with crawling insects , while the men went to break out and back-furrow the remaining balks in the cotton fields , and to begin planting kaoliang . To pacify the dragon we dusted cinnabar under the folded quilts on all the k'angs , and we carried cooking ashes and placed them in rings around all the wells , both that for drinking and those for irrigation scattered about the farm . It happened that one of these irrigation wells , with a long canted bamboo lever for a lifting arm , was in a field adjacent to one of Sun 's , and a squad of Sun hogs was planting there . Second was among them . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Old Sun had a kind of private militia of armed yellow supervisors , and we saw Second run across the field to the one who was in charge of the planting squad . The slave and the militiaman talked a few moments . Then Second broke away and came at a loping run toward us . He was out of breath when he reached us . Gasping , he said , " I have only a moment  --  White Lotus  --  come over here . " He drew me aside . Jasmine was alarmed and suspicious . I heard her ask Moth , " Who is this pig ? " " Ai ! " Moth said . " He 's an old turtle . Do n't bother yourself . I know him . " And Moth made that middle-finger gesture of hers , of a man 's readiness . Mischievous girl , she was trying to make Jasminethink that Second was after my mouse . Second , his chest heaving , leaned down to me . " Dolphin  --  he has been asking for you  --  he 's in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? " Second was still gulping air . " Bambooed  --  bad . "  | " When ? What happened ? " " Later  --  the bastards 'll give it to me  --  have to go . " " Tell me ! " " The son of a turtle said he 'd skin me  --  said run over , run back . " " But you could be telling me  --  " " Old Night-Soil Basket "  --  so the slaves called Old Sun  --  " he took charge himself . Pepper  --  you know that bastard pig ?  --  he told on Dolphin  --  about the shoat  --  Dolphin beat Pepper up boxing once . Old Night-Soil Basket sat in his sedan chair  --  they had Dolphin 's hands tied up to a tree  --  Old Night-Soil Basket threatened branding  --  satthere talking while the turtles gave it to Dolphin . They took him down  --  laid him in a cart . Old Night-Soil Basket said , You 're one of my best hogs , what's-your-name , or I 'd have given you a number-one bambooing  --  but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I thought I would just dust you off this time . You be a good hog now . Behave yourself . If I ever catch you again , I shall be obliged to give you a proper pounding with the heavy bamboo  --  not just an easy one like this . You understand , what'syour-name ? ' Old Night-Soil Basket never knows our names . " " What about Dolphin ? " " They took him in the cart  --  sick-house . I have to go . It 'll be me next if I do n't go . " Second ran off . I was agitated all day . With the help of Moth , who was adept at plausible excuses , I concocted a story , which I whispered to Hua 's wife , about having irregular periods , about being afraid that the water influences of the Number Six Field to the east of the slave hut had affected the fire element in my lower body ; I wanted to consult the old yellow monk , a mendicant physician , who treated the inmates of Sun 's sick-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes I had a chit to go to the sick-house . During the hushed conference between our master and mistress , Moth stole a scoopful of pork lard from one of the jars in the " cool corner " of the work space , and she wrapped it in some dried kaoliang leaves , and as I set out for Sun 's she slipped the package into my tunic and whispered , " For his cuts  --  the best help . " I remembered , from the sight of her naked back , that day in the cotton field , that Moth was not a stranger to bamboo rods . With one exception the buildings at Old Sun 's were sound ,  |p360clean  , and made of bricks . The exception was the slaves ' sickhouse , which was in fact a pesthole . Set off at a far corner of the slaves ' vast compound , out of sight and mind of the master 's family , it was one large room , its walls of mud and kaoliang stalks ; its floor of dirt ; its roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its one window tattered and flapping . There were two huge communal k'angs , in whose ovens inadequate fires were lit once a day , only to flicker out before the damp clay of the beds was dried out , to say nothing of warmed , and on these k'angs lay the slave inmates . As I entered the open doorway I felt the beginning of an anger that was to grow during the next few minutes to an almost uncontainable pressure . An old man , nearly eighty , covered with a tattered quilt , lay staring with glittering eyes at the roof beams as he waited for the end ; a multitude of flies crawled about his mouth , which sagged open , for he was snoring , though awake . A handful of women ( complications of childbirth , fevers , rheumatism ) sat with crossed legs near the window stoically passing the time with talk . And in the dark far corner , with a cloth over his head , and the back of his tunic stained with dried blood , lying prone , was a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the k'ang toward him on my hands and knees . My anger now was a hard knot in my throat . I knelt beside him . Perhaps he was sleeping . Should I touch him on an arm ? After a time I leaned forward until my mouth was near the cloth over his head , and I murmured in a voice so quiet that it would not rouse him if he was asleep , " I brought some lard for your back . " With a suddenness that startled me , one of Dolphin 's hands snatched the cloth away from his head , and he lifted his matprintedcheek and turned his eyes enough to look up at me . This was the first time he had seen me with my sooty hair and bean earrings . " Ai ! " he said , his mouth curling in a bitter smile . " Who let in the magpie ? " " I brought some lard for your back , " I said in a voice shaking now with two angers . " I do n't have a back , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old back . " " Would you like me to spread the lard ? " " Listen , little Fall-Down . I would n't give a turtle 's droppingp361to have a potful of hair dye spread on my cuts . Why do n't you go home to Dirty I-Iua ? " He pulled the cloth over his head . My anger was dissolving into a nameless and bottomless heat that was far worse . " It was not easy for me to get here , " I said . " I 'll tell you the easy way , " the voice under the cloth said , blowing out part of the cloth in small puffs . " Steal a shoat . " Something now took hold of me , and with firm hands I lifted Dolphin 's near shoulder , reached under his chest , and undid , one by one , the cloth-knot fasteners of his tunic . He did not resist . In fact he rolled a bit to his side to make my task easier . But as I did the horrible work of pulling the tunic away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse at me for trying to make myself look like a yellow woman . By now my pulsing anger  --  not at him , but at them  --  had surged back again , and I did not care what he said . I took the cloth from his head and spread the lard on it with my hand , and applied the whole compress to the broad place at which I could not bear to look , and Dolphin stopped railing . The old man with the flies swarming around his open mouth suddenly started to groan . The sick women paid me no attention . I leaned forward to Dolphin 's ear again and in a low furious voice said , " I am your sow , you terrible hog . " Dolphin said , " Go away . " An ancient yellow monk , in filthy yellow robes , with a shaved head and a black spot on his forehead , was sunning himself against the sick-house wall when I emerged . I went to him , kowtowedin the dust , and said , " Old Worshipful , sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes every day for a month . " I held up for him to see the coppers that Hua 's wife had given me for medicine . " What is your trouble , small sow ? " the old man said . " My trouble is the man who was beaten . " " Ayah , " the monk said . " You are a very sick pig . " He fumbled in a greasy bag , then took out inkstone , water jar , brush cylinder , and a scrap of thin paper . He wrote what I wanted . I gave him the coppers . My " sickly " month was the best time I had ever had under yellow dominion . I visited the old monk at Sun 's sick-house  --  or , in other words , Dolphin  --  every afternoon . I continued my secret lessons with the old uncle . I feigned a weakness which completely fooled Dirty Hua and which earned me light work part of the time . I kept wheedling coppers from Hua 's wife for powders and pills the old monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dolphin . Spring was now well advanced . I entered the sick-house carrying a branch of pear blossoms . Dolphin was able to sit up ; his industry was a surprise to me . He was weaving a mat . Day after day he wove baskets of bamboo splits and mats of kaoliang splits , made brooms , sewed canvas mule collars stuffed with kaoliang leaves  --  and all these products he sold to Old Sun 's militia supervisors . He kept the money from these efforts and the coppers I gave him in a money belt that he wore at all times . His hands were flying . " Are you going to buy me a beautiful sedan chair ? " I asked him . " I am going to buy you a beautiful nothing to wrap your most valuable nothings in , " Dolphin said . I knew well enough why he wanted money  --  to help get himself to the mountain ; but this knowledge I pushed to the back of my head . We were planting cotton . Some days I worked between Lank on the fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend him my mouse ; I was sorry for him , and he knew it ) and Grin on the after plow . Lank , up ahead , behind a mismatched team , a donkey and a bullock yoked together , lightly opened the crests of the back-furrowed beds , and I , walking behind him , drilled the cotton seeds , and Grin came along behind me with a concave board on a plow stock to cover the drills . The air was soft ; redbud , black haw , and jasmine were in bloom along the edges of the fields . " How long are you going to keep up this sick-house game ? " Grin asked from his plow behind me . " Until I am well , " I called over my shoulder . " Ai ! Do you mean well the way Moth is well ? " She was so far along in her pregnancy as to be excused from field work ; she had only about a month to go . I held my tongue . My silence spoke of my happiness , which teasingcould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a furrow I had a chill ; I had imagined for a moment in my rhapsodical eye ,  |p363against  the blue horizon , a frightening faraway mountain , its brow blood red in a sunset . It was a season of watching and waiting  --  the seedlings appeared in spite of a chilling rain in the first week , and I felt sure , with anticipation blind to consequences , that Dolphin would soon ask me to help him make good use of the warming up of the spring nights . He was healed and back at work . A tiny toad hopped out from under a seedling once when we were chopping weeds . " Watch out with your hoe there ! " Jasmine sharply said . It was bad luck to kill a toad ; it meant you would stub your toe . She clucked her tongue and shook her head over my absent-mindedness . " What is the matter with you ? " the old uncle peevishly asked me one day during a lesson . He was seated on the stool of the spinning wheel ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you lost interest in our work ? " I burst into tears ; I could not tell the broken old man how full I was of delight and hope . The third day of the third month was Ch'ing Ming , the spring festival  --  a day when the yellows visited their ancestors ' graves , offered a feast to the spirits of those who were gone , and directed their slaves to repair the graves . Now Hua 's wife was distantly related to Old Sun , and on Ch'ing Ming all of us save gravid Moth went to the burying ground , our owners to worship at , and we to repair , the graves of Hua 's wife 's grandparents and parents . For me the trip into the Sun family graveyard was a thrilling curiosity , for Moth had long since told me that the Sun graveyard was a favorite trysting place for white lovers . It afforded perfect safety ; the yellows were known never to set foot in the burying grounds at night . Where would Dolphin and I lie ? Between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow ? Near the artistic wall , its designs of studded bricks and blue-plastered spaces now so brilliant in the sunshine ? Squads of Sun hogs were working all around us . I felt that I was in the grip of brassbound certainties : Dolphin was among the uniformed men , I would encounter him , he would command me top364meet him here in the graveyard  --  not on this night , because there would be too many other white pairs copulating among the mounds on a night when so many hogs were reminded of this safe place , but two or three nights from now . I did not even look for Dolphin ; he would find me . He would ask me . And when the time came .. . These certainties in my mind caused a piercing pain of anticipationand longing in my chest . Yes , there was Dolphin . Yes , he was coming with sure strides toward me . I was calm . I knew what was to happen . I thought I would melt from that hot melancholy pain in my chest . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had my hair done up in spiral coils as a sign that I was available for marriage  --  at any rate , available . Would he notice ? " Fall-Down ! " he said , coming straight up to me . He looked around and saw that Hua and his wife were busy several paces away setting out the propitiating foods . " Listen to speech . I want to ask you something . " " Yes . " With every fiber of my being I was ready . " Look . You 've got me in trouble . " " How trouble ? What trouble ? " " The old monk at the sick-house , he says you owe him money , he says you owe him a hundred cash , he says if you do n't pay him he 's going to tell Old Sun I had a Hua sow come and lie with me every afternoon while I was in the sick-house . " I had not yet even realized the inappropriateness of my facial expression . Dolphin seemed thoroughly annoyed . Yet I still stood receptive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , with asinine eagerness . " As soon as I can get a chit I 'll pay him . . . . But , Dolphin . I did n't lie with you . " " He 'll make it so . The yellow people always believe a monk . " " But I did n't , Dolphin . " With a rush I was telling myself , but not Dolphin , that I owed the monk nothing , that he was an extortionist , and worse  --  he used his holy calling to suck slaves . Yet I wanted to keep my mind on the invitation Dolphin was surely .. . " You 'd better get the money to him . Before they skin me again . " At last I was beginning to mobilize myself . I saw a passage of uncertainty in Dolphin 's face . He appeared to want to turn on his heel and walk away , yet something held him  --  a moment 's vacillation . In all my days of visiting him at the sick-house he had never spoken an endearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wanting me ?  --  that he would ask for me , today ? I had become so certain , I now imagined , because of my reading of just such moments of hesitation as this in a man to whom decisivenesswas the only valid pose . There was that hint of tightnessaround his mouth . I moved close to him and said in an urgent voice , " I 'll come here day after tomorrow night , I 'll wait for you . " Dolphin said nothing and showed nothing , unless possibly a draining off into his eyes of some of the feeling , whatever it was , that had stiffened his mouth . He began to turn . I delayed him for a moment by saying , " Under the willow . " Now he turned away and I said to his back , " After the timekeeper'sgong for the first quarter of the night . " The selfish man was walking quickly away . Under a cuticle moon I could barely make out the nearestgrave mounds . I stood beneath the willow , my hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sense of reality . Willow ! Symbol , in the yellows ' tales , of frailty and lust . The cemetery wall was at my back . My eyes , adjusted to the night , strained up the hill toward the main gate . I felt gloomy . The night air was damp , and walking alone among the newly weeded graves in the dark had been quite a different matter from our social outing on Ch'ing Ming in dazzling sunlight . Dolphinhad by no means agreed to meet me . Slipping away from our k'ang in the slave hut had been a strain . Would Daddy Chick waken and miss me , and if he did , could he be counted upon not to report me to Hua ? Near me , a grave of some important Sun ancestor was surmountedby a huge marble tortoise bearing on his back an inscribedtablet . Why a turtle  --  the yellows ' most insulting curse word ? I felt all about me forces I could not understand , and over me the ragged willow seemed to have stars clinging like aphids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exorcise evil spirits that might be near me . A motion on the hill ! I gripped the tree trunk harder , unable to decide whether to run toward or away from the apparition.  |p366I  had said I would wait for him under the tree . I would try to stay where I was . The moving thing came closer and closer . It paused , divided into two , and sat on the great marble turtle and laughed in two drunken voices  --  man 's and woman 's . Then it folded into a tight ball and rolled down the ancestor 's mound and fumbled in a draw between graves , not ten paces from me , and I began to hear grunts , sharply drawn breaths , moans , and suppressed cries . In the midst of this I saw a new figure swiftly approaching . It came down the hill toward the willow and straight through the draw , and I saw it go down , stumbling over the drunken fornicators ; then I heard a woman 's horrified gasp and a man cursing , then guffaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me under the tree . He was shaking with laughter . The other forms were scrambling uphill ; I saw them drop down several mounds away . I did not know , beyond a flood of relief , what I felt . Anxiety , awe , hope , fear of the dark , a slave 's inchoate longing , a feeling of the rawness of life that came from eavesdropping on the drunken lusts of others . " You decided to come , " I said in a voice whose trembling I heard indifferently , as if it were not mine . Dolphin did not speak or move for a long time . Then he took my cheeks in his palms and lifted my face . Never , until that moment , had Dolphin , by word or act , showed me the slightest sign of outgoing tenderness , but now I felt in his hands , which shook like my voice of a moment ago , the full force of a **25;5936;TOOLONG that must have been a male slave 's lot . I did not know whether this force had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless passivity of his days ; this blundering , wild , unstoppable assertion by night , its power expressedin its very gentleness . This touch of the cupping hands was far more intense than anything I had been offered in those few minutes long ago in the small dark room in Chao-er 's tavern . Now explicit feeling began to pour into me . All my hopes and daydreams of so many days had shaped this flood of  --  why , there was nothing to call it but desperation . The warm hands on my cheeks filled me with a blind and boundless desperation . We lay together . ' in the very draw where the drunken pair had made those unbridled noises . A grave to one side looked to my distracted glance , in a moment of transport of an order that wasp367new in my life , like a  --  could I bear to think it ?  --  like a distant mountain . Did I make sounds like that drunken woman 's ? I do not know . We stayed in the draw until the sky began to lighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my beliefs that moonlight and starlight , no matter how pale , could paralyze a sleeping cheek , and that if a glowworm crawled across a sleeping eye , that eye would never see again . I was in the clutch of a fatal greed  --  fatal , I mean , for a two-legged sow . I wanted to possess Dolphin . I wanted him for mine alone . We slept together often in the graveyard and in the woods and in the open fields , always now at Dolphin 's urging . He enjoyed me ; he spoke , at last , some tender , almost abject , words of promise to me . I came second with him : himself came first . But I was greedy . I determined that we would be married , knowing perfectly well that slave marriages in the yellow dominionwere meaningless . They consisted of owners ' permissions , and they lasted until an owner 's convenience required the moving of one partner to another farm , or until a master sold husband or wife away  --  or , indeed , until one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's owner cared about was that she should breed , increasing his wealth . In those days I began to wear a charm to help bring this determinationof mine to pass  --  a pair of mole paws on a cord around my neck . This talisman , which I bought from a peddler with stolen coppers , restored to me a feeling of confidence that I had never felt since the owner of the East Garden had snatched my relic of the Guevavi martyr from my neck when we were first sold . How fitting !  --  the spadelike tools that a blind creature used to make his way through the endless sod of this world . Yet how perverse the charm was , too ! Moth had whispered to me of something secretly called the Kingdom of the Mole  --  a place beyond " the mountains , " beyond the borders of the slave provinces , where , though the territory was supposed to be free , Imperiailaws still required the return of slaves who had escaped from the slave lands ; it was said that there certain yellow " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to safety far from the borders . And so my charm presaged both getting and losing ... . First , before I even opened the way for Dolphin to ask me to marry him , I had to make sure that Hua and his wife would give their permission . I thought that this would readily be granted : all they could wish was for me to be pregnant , to give them a gift of another piglet on the place . Two events now took place , however , which forced me to postponemy plan . Before dawn one morning in the fourth ' month Moth began to suffer birth pains . Jasmine , who was to serve as midwife , prepared for the delivery , and I did whatever Jasmine told me . I had never seen a baby born , and when the labor began in earnest I was afraid , partly for Moth but indirectly for myself , imagining myself in Moth 's place on the straw mats on the mud k'ang in our slave hut  --  pale hands gripping a plow handle , forehead running with sweat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unearthly cries . Jasmine anointed her hands with lard . She made poor Moth between pains drink some tea made from the clay of a mud-wasp 's nest , to ease her labor , and for the good influences of iron we placed the head of a hoe in the k'ang oven under her . Jasmine sent me out to collect cobwebs to stem hemorrhages , and to steal some sugar from Hua 's wife 's jar to put on the dressings afterward . When , hours later , a strange object , cheese-covered and blotched , emerged at last to my terror from a struggling Moth , Jasmine lifted it upside down in her firm hands and with hard blows knocked breath into it . It squalled ! It had tiny fruit in its crotch ! A noisy boy ! A great value to the Huas ! Jasmine , overjoyed , cleaned it up . She put a greasy bit of halfcookedpork fat in its mouth " to clean out the insides , " and she made me light a fire outdoors and burn the afterbirth  --  else , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chore that made me ill . When I returned , the baby was still crying , and Jasmine was murmuring over it . " Look ! " she said to me , pointing at his tightly clenched fists , so perfect and delicate , like secret scrolls of fern in earliest spring . " He 's going to be a thief , he 'll turn out a thief  --  that 's what it means when they grip their hands like that . " This seemed to delight Jasmine . Hua 's wife came and inspected the baby . I saw the mistress'sp369face cloud over , her jaw set up hard . She swept out in a wild fury . Then Jasmine showed me the awful trouble that had come into our house : The infant 's skin was yellowish , its hair was black , its still-squinted eyes were " good "  --  there were the telltale vertical folds of the inner canthi , drawing down the skin to prove who was the father . We moved in fear . Stealthily the second morning we washed the baby in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the child immune to the diseases that killed white infants . For days Hua 's wife spoke to no one . Hua , who had been increasinglymorose since the sale of his crop , lay low ; he got out of his wife 's way like a wonk with its tail between its legs . How unlike a master he was ! In small ways we slaves were rude to him , but we kept our distance from the seething yellow woman . Moth , recovering , fondling her doll-like infant with all sorts of cooing and murmuring , was oblivious of the storm that was raging in the main house . A few days later , the second deterrent : One of Old Sun 's private militia discovered , buried under sacks in the old miser 's seed house , some literature from the so-called Uncage-the-Finches Society in the Northern Capital . A large number of Sun hogs , Dolphin among them , were shut up in a bamboo palisade and were questioned for days on end about these documents . We were dimly aware of an unaccountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the faraway core provinces , who wanted all slaves throughout the Empire to be set free . But this fervor was remote ; the harsh , exhausting routine of our daily lives dulled our minds , and apart from a persistent aching consciousness of " the mountain , " toward which we could struggle one by one if our individual lots drove us to such a mad risk , we gave little thought to the vague rumors . Besides , we mistrusted yellows who wanted to help us  --  what did they really want ? The discovery of the literature , however , terrified the masters and impressed the slaves of the entire district . It was , indeed , the violent reaction of the slaveowners rather than the broadsheets themselves that stirred us to endless whispered conferences out of the yellows ' earshot . Even Daddy Chick made our hearts beat wildly by playing tunes on his Tartar fiddle which , without his singing at all , acted onp370us like thrilling messages in code , for we knew the unsung words of the songs : The finch in the pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . And another  --  about " the mountain " : Ten thousand stones , the path is a place to stumble . From the high crag the path can not be seen . It was certain that Daddy Chick had no thought whatever of running away , yet he played these " away songs " on his soughing fiddle with a melancholy that made us , as we lay on the k'angs , grind our teeth . For a week I lost track of Dolphin . We could not get any word back and forth . There opened before my eyes the abyss that life without him would be . When Moth 's little mix was nine days old , it was time to name him . On Moth 's first rising at dawn she carried the infant three times around the slave hut and then , at the door , Jasmine loudly pronounced the name Moth had chosen : Apple . We all kissed Moth , who wept with joy . Jasmine 's children had all survived , and Moth felt that Jasmine understood the magic that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of life as a chattel . One night the baby was fretful . We were all up . Jasmine made Grin light his pipe and , drawing on it , she blew smoke on the throbbing fontanel of Apple 's head . " It 'll make him drunk , " she said . The baby was soon asleep . Apple had a pale birthmark on its chest . Jasmine directed Moth to lick it for nine successive days to make it go away . She said it would fade in a few months . Jasmine had endless advice . " Feed a child out of the cooking pan , and he 'll go to the mountain when he gets big enough . If he turns out to stutter give him a drink of tea out of a bell . Do n't show him his face in a mirror until he 's a year old , or he 'll be tongue-tied . When you take him out in the fields , Moth , do n't shade him with a hat belonging to Hua , or his teeth will be slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his limbs in the water we 've used to cook rice if you want to keep him from being bowlegged . In the fields do n't put him down and then forget and step across him ; he wo n't thrive if you do that , he 'll be stunted.  |p371To  dry up when you 're weaning him , hang an old cash that 's been worn smooth around your neck , hang it down between your breasts , then take it off and put it on an anthill , and when the ants go down you 'll dry up . You can rub camphor on your breasts , too . " Moth said , " Stop , stop ! You make me dizzy . " Moth now returned to the fields on a suckler 's status . She left the infant in charge of Hua 's wife , whose face puckered daily , as if she had been chewing hot ginger root , at the sight of the little master-begotten bastard . Moth was excused to the main house at brief intervals during the day to feed the child at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cool her milk . " Hua 's wife made no secret of her continuing fury at Hua , and her sarcasm against him , in our presence , made us laugh when we achieved the privacy of the slave hut . Moth seemed not the least bit ashamed of the paternity of her baby ; in fact , she spoke of " opportunities " that might open up to a little mix , and I thought she carried herself with an almost insolent pride before Hua 's wife , who , surprisingly , now that the baby was born and the half-suspected truth was out , behaved towards Moth with a forbearance that verged on tenderness . Hearing that the grillings in the bamboo stockade had been brought to an inconclusive end , and that Dolphin and the other suspects had been set at large , but still having heard nothing more from him , I decided to set about getting what I wanted . One day I helped the mistress clean the floors of the main house . We spread dampened charcoal ashes on the caked dirt and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " then swept them up and threw them out in the courtyard , where I scattered them with the back of a wooden rake . I went in the house and abruptly told Hua 's wife that I wanted to marry a hog belonging to Old Sun . I saw at once that she would accede ; I thought she seemed relieved . However , she said , " It is bad for slaves on separate farms to marry . " " May I ask Old Venerable ? " We slaves used honorifics only when we begged for favors . Perhaps she saw my appeal as a chance to punish her husband in some vague way . She said , " I 'll take care of it with him . " Two days later Hua 's wife took me aside and said , " All right.  |p372You  may ask his permission now . " Why the half-formed smile ? Had she brought it home to Hua that my marriage would place me out of bounds to his itch ? What had she put in my lips as she quoted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whatever had been behind that smirk of hers  --  was bad-tempered . " I have no objection , " he said . " But I 'll wager you will never get old Night-Soil Basket 's permission . " How undignified for a yellow man to use hogs ' epithets ! " And if you do marry this pig , do n't ask for a chit every night . It is no good to marry a pig on another farm . " Hua walked away from me . Had I not been completely absorbed by my sweet greed , I might have been frightened by Hua 's manner . Now Dolphin . I thought of using the policy Moth advised  --  suddenly refuse to go out in the fields and lie with him ; drive him to distraction with desire ; make a bargain  --  that in exchange for marriage . But I decided to do just the opposite : give myself to him altogether . This was easy . Was I not a slave to begin with ? Within a fortnight he had , without a word of prompting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse him ! He said he would ask his master 's permission . At work at Hua 's I waited anxiously for three days for some word from Dolphin . Then one of Old Sun 's militiamen came to Hua with a curt message that Sun Lao-yeh intended to buy the slave girl White Lotus from Hua for seventeen taels of silver  --  a despicable price , an insulting condescension , which only a patron could offer a man who was at his mercy . Hua blew up . He saw himself driven to ground  --  his wife and his patron after him like vicious wild dogs . Hua railed ; the militiamenremained calm and over-patient . " Sun Lao-yeh is doing this for the sake of the two pigs , " the militiaman said with infuriating serenity and obvious hypocrisy . " The permanence of the marriage depends on their living together , working side by side , being drawn together by common ex-periences . " " Turtle shit ! " Hua screamed . " The old squeeze-purse wants the girl because pig offspring follow the condition of the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been called a squeeze-purse . " The upshot was that Hua went himself , in his tunic that was out at the elbows , to plead with Old Sun.  |p373Hua  came back with permission to keep me  --  and with permissionfor me to marry Dolphin . Hua exulted before his wife and before us all at having pulled off this result , but there was something unconvincing in his pride . What had he yielded to make this bargain ? He made it amply clear to me that I was in his debt . I saw this ; it was Moth who pointed out to me that his wife saw it , too . We chose the holiday of the Summer Festival , fifth fifth , as our wedding date . Hua 's wife was suddenly like an aunty hen to me . She gave me three louse-bedding gowns , and Moth , who was childishly excited by my prospects , showed me how to dye them in bright colors . We boiled hickory bark and bay leaves , and strained the brew , and let it stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the gowns in cold water , plunged it in the boiling dye , let it soak awhile , and took it out , dried it , then set it with urine . That was my yellow dress . We dyed another in bamboo and set it in copperas , and that was my red . We dyed the third in pine straw and set it with vinegar , and that was my purple . My old dress that I had been wearing in the fields we dyed in indigo and set it with alum , and that was my blue . The colors were uneven and streaked , but they were at least colors . Hua hovered about these activities with a surly expression . " What courtesans ! " he sarcastically said . We gathered petals of jasmine and leaves of sweet basil , and we stole some cloves from the kitchen , and we folded these things into my colored gowns and let them stand three days , and then my clothes were good-smelling . The entire day before the wedding Hua 's wife kept me shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a sheet of bamboo matting that she propped against the loom . " A bride must not be seen , " she said . She handed food to me around the edge of the screen in a bowl . In the afternoon a cart came from Old Sun with gifts for the bride 's " family "  --  meaning the Huas : two dozen hunks of bread , a box of noodles , a penury of rice , some salt from the sea , and the carcass of a pig . Obedient to custom , Hua cut the pig in two and sent half back . " Look at this skinny animal , " Hua bitterly said.
