txt April , T. S. Eliot advises us , is the cruelest month , but for Khrushchev it is likely to be March . The Soviet boss is coming to Paris March 15 in the hope of weaning de Gaulle from his Western ties . He will go home disappointed . Russia has , of course , been delighted by evidence of differences between Gaullist France and its allies . Paris no longer likes the way NATO is organized and wants it to be directed by a Big Three committee . De Gaulle is even think- , mg of pulling his army out of the present command system . But this in no way means , as Khrushchev will discover , that de Gaulle imagines quitting the alliance . Nor will the General cease to base French policy upon a European , a Western and an Atlantic foundation . He wants to revise that Foundation , not destroy it . He is totally loyal to the American and British partners who will join him at the summit . He will countenance no Khrushchev efforts to settle major proklems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust off the Soviet-French treaty signed in 1944 and denounced by Moscow eleven years later . If so he is in for a disappointment . De Gaulle sees no need for renewing such a pact . It was negotiated while Germany was still at war . France is now one of the West Germans ' strongest allies  --  and will remain so . Splitting Moves Doomed Undoubtedly Khrushchev would like to split the Western front before the summit talks and undoubtedly he has chosen France as the subject for such a splitting operation . This is a mistake . For , if the allies find de Gaulle difficult , Khrushchev will find him adamant . This will become plain when the word Berlin is mentioned . The Russians chose to manufacture an unneeded crisis there in order to provoke big-power talks . They are now applying new , pre-summit pressures . These leave de Gaulle unmoved . He sees no sense in giving Khrushchev what he wants or in being panicked into an unreasonable course . Nor does de Gaulle cherish illusions that the summit can produce significant results . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is acceptance of the existing status quo . This would imply a certain armaments balance and agreement by both sides not to attack each other . But even this , he seems to feel , is most unlikely . The Russians ' long-range aim is to spread their influence . The allies ' long-range aim is to reduce it . Neither side can abandon those ambitions . Even on disarmament Khrushchev will derive slight comfort in the French approach . De Gaulle has just entered the atomic club and has every intention of continuing nuclear experiments . He is not interested in ending test explosions ; unless , that is , all members of the club stop making fission weapons and scrap all those that they already have . His only solution is to control the means of delivering atomic warheads , inspection of missile sites . Khrushchev can not be expected to relish this idea . De Gaulle Unlikely to Yield Thus , on anything important , Khrushchev will learn de Gaulle has nothing to yield to any blandishment . And what kind of blandishments does Khrushchev have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with France 's massive Communist party . Or , if he does , nobody will believe him . Anyway , de Gaulle does n't really care . He can not promise to give de Gaulle soviet nuclear weapons . De Gaulle intends to build his own atomic arsenal . He does n't even plan to ask the United States to share these deadly stores . Furthermore , Khrushchev ca n't offer France what he refuses to give his ally , China . Nor can he promise to help le Gaulle solve the Algerian war . Khrushchev does n't control the rebel F. L. N. ( National Liberation Front ) . En fact , F. L. N. Communist sympathizers have recently lost ground . Thus Khrushchev comes to Paris n burgeoning March with high hopes , a bag full of propaganda , but nothing substantial to trade . And all he should expect to take away with him is happy memories . We in the West have sometimes ; rumbled that de Gaulle is an awkward and even embarrassing partner . But Khrushchev will find that he is indeed our partner  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most resolute of them all . There will be no deals in Paris between Khrushchev and de Gaulle .
