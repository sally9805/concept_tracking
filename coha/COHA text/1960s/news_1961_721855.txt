txt The administration is planning to ( drop eight Army National Guard and Reserve divisions in a move related to plans for reorganizing the Army 's divisional structure . The eight divisions to be discontinued have not been selected , according to official sources . The reduction will be an Executive action , which Congress can countermand by a veto vote in either house . The cutback , from a total of thirty-seven divisions  --  twentyseven National Guard and ten ! Army Reserve  --  will mean a sizable reduction of total reserve forces and may precipitate a political battle in Congress . The Army National Guard has a total strength slightly exceeding the 400,000 officers and men authorized in existing legislation . However , the Kennedy Administration is recommending that the National Guard be cut to 360,000 , as did the Eisenhower Administration . The Army Reserve units include 300,000 officers and men , but the Republican and Democratic Administrations both supported budget requests that would have reduced this number to 270,000 . Congress , however , // consistently thwarted the efforts of the Eisenhower Administration to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years , it has written the appropriations laws so that reserve strength could not be lowered by the usual administration device of refusing to spend available funds . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , in his final budget message , made clear his strong feelings on the subject when he complained as follows : " The excess strengths which have been provided by the Congress above my recommendations in the last several years are unnecessarily costing the American people over $80,000 , - 000 annually and have been too long based on other than strictly military needs . " General Eisenhower apparently referred to the long-standing reputation of the National Guard as one of the best politically protected organizations in the country . National Guard units are under the executive authority ' of the governors , while in reserve status , and the law provides that " no unit of the National Guard * * * shall be withdrawn from any community or area** *until the governor * * * shall have been , consulted and shall have con- ' sented * ? . " During recent Congressional , hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials were questioned closely on their attitude toward the National Guard and ' the Reserve . Several legislators emphasized that regardless of the Administration 's recommen-I dations , Congress would again ! impose existing statutory per- ! sonnet levels . Secretary and his aides appear confident that they ' will succeed where General Eisenhower failed in overcoming political barriers and cutting the reserve strength . There were indications from National Guard sources that the Guard leaders , if not the politicians who back them , might have been won over to the most recent reorganization plan . An effort would be made , under the new plan , to maintain various headquarters , cadres and transportation facilities , including aircraft , at the disposal of governors who would lose the Federally supported National Guard units . According to the newest na-I tional war plan , military leaders have set the reserve requirement at twenty-nine divisions , not twenty-seven as previously indicated . The in- , crease of the requirement by Itwo divisions reflects a slightly ' changed attitude toward the question of whether reserves ' can be made ready in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to Congress last week , disclosed Army plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of reserve forces . According to these plans , two combat-ready units would move on two weeks ' notice and a total of ten divisions on eight weeks ' notice . The President 's statement drew skeptical comments in some quarters . It was said that the reserve units would require more and better equipment . It was also said that the increased pace of weekly and summer training would prove too much for the citizen soldiers , many , of whom are World War II and Korean War veterans . On the other hand , Pentagon authorities have promised Na- ' tional Guard leaders the modern ' equipment they desire . In addition . the National Guard and Reserve units will be formed into smaller , more flexible , morel mobile units . The National Guard is composed of six armored divisions and twenty-one infantry divisions . Each state has a unit , but several states share divisional headquarters on a rotation basis . New York , Texas I and California have two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units are described as strategic outfits , ready for almost instantaneous call . Their identities are officially secret . Seven of the Army 's Reserve divisions are also earmarked for quick reaction .
