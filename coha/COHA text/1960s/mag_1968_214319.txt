Mobs of screaming students last week swarmed through the vast Shinjuku rail way station , Tokyo 's largest . Wearing plastic helmets , the lower half of their faces masked with towels as a protection against tear gas , the students scrambled over tracks and platforms , smashing train windows , disemboweling seats , splintering and setting fire to doors , benches and stairways . One rioter shinnied up a pole to smash the signal lights - he touched a high-voltage line and crashed to earth in a shower of sparks , critically injured . <P> As railway employees raced to put out the fires , riot police assembled in the darkness down the tracks and charged . They were met but not stopped by a shower of rocks . The sound of staves flailing against police shields and batons banging on plastic helmets echoed through the train shed . Bodies rolled in hand-to-hand combat . The battered and bleeding were carted off by rescue squads of both sides . <P> Purple Dye . Student reinforcements poured into the wide plaza outside the station . To the bleat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns , chanting , " Oppose the Viet Nam war ! " and " Down with the Security Pact !
