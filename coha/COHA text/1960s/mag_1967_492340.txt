In November , 1965 , units of the 7th Cavalry began to make the first American penetration in force of a Communist stronghold near the Cambodian border . On November 15 . Smith 's battalion was ordered in to help the 1st Battalion , which was meeting strong resistance . This was the beginning of the Battle of the la Thong Valley , the first pitched battle fought by ,  - -  imerican soldiers in the war for Viet  --  nam , and the bloodiest engagement of the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle , Smith and the 500 other men of the 2nd Battalion came upon a clearing , known on the maps as X-ray , where the 1st Bat  --  talion was fighting , The names of the soldiers have been changed , but , in all other respects , this is what happened . The 1st Battalion had been fighting continuously for three or four days , and I had never seen such filthy troops . Some of them had blood on their faces from scratches and from other guys ' wounds . Some had long rips in their clothing where shrapnel and bullets had missed them . They all had that look of shock . They said little , just looked around with darting . nervous eyes . Whenever I heard a shell coming close , I 'd duck , but they 'd keep stand  --  ing . After three days of constant bom  --  bardment you get so you can tell from the sound how close a shell is going to land within 50 to 75 feet . There were some wounded lying around , bandaged up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coma with plasma bottles hanging above their stretchers . Late that morning the Cong made a charge . About 100 of them jumped up and made for our lines , and all hell broke loose . The people in that sector opened up with everything they had . Then a couple of our Skyraiders came in . One of them dropped a lot of stuff that shimmered in the sun like green confetti . It looked like a ticker-tape parade . but . when the things hit the ground , the little pieces exploded . They were antipersonnel charges . Every one of the gooks was killed . Another group on the other side almost made it to the lines . There were n't enough GI 's there . and they could n't shoot them down fast enough . A plane dropped some napalm bombs just in front of the line . I could n't see the gooks , but I could hear them scream as they burned . A ' All of o sudden they opened op , rich 0/110- matie weapam. 11 was on1 , . : least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men dead , just like that . My company , Charlie Company , took over its sector of the battalion perimeter and started to dig in . At three o'clock another attack came , but it never amounted to any  --  thing . I did n't get any sleep that night . There was continuous firing from one until four , and it was as bright as day with the flares lighting up the sky . The next morning the order came for us to move out . I guess our command  --  ers felt the battle was over . The three battalions of PAVN ( People 's Army of Vietnam  --  the North Vietnamese ) were destroyed . There must have been about 1,000 rotting bodies out there , starting about 20 feet from us and surrounding the giant circle of foxholes . As we left the perimeter , we walked by them . Some of them had been lying out there for four clays . There are more ants in Vietnam than in any place 1 have ever seen . We were being with  --  drawn to Landing Zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be picked up by helicop  --  ter . About noon the col umn stopped and everybody flopped on the ground . It turned out that our re  --  connaissance platoon had come upon four sleeping PAVN who had claimed they were deserters , They said that there were three or four snipers in the trees up ahead ? friends of theirs who did not want to surrender . The head of the column formed by our battalion was already in the land  --  ing zone , which was actually only 30 yards to our left . But our company was still in the woods and elephant grass . I dropped my gear and my ax , which was standard equipment for supply clerks like me . We used them to cut down trees to help make landing zones for our helicopters . The day had grown very hot . I was about one quarter through a smoke when a few shots cracked at the front of the column . I flipped my cigarette butt , lay down and grabbed my M-16 . The fire in front was still growing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seemed to come from the trees . There was firing all over the place now , and I was get  --  ting scared . A bullet hit the dirt a foot to my side , and some started whistling over my head . This was n't the three or four snipers we had been warned about . There were over 100 North Vietnamese snipers tied in the trees above us  --  so we learned later  --  way above us. in the top branches . The firing kept increasing . Our executive officer tX0 ) jumped up and said . " Follow me , and let 's get the hell out of here . " I followed him , along with the rest of the headquarters sectionand the 1st Platoon . Wecrouched and ran to the right toward what we thought was the landing zone . But it was only a small clearing  --  the L.Z. was to our left . We were running deeper into the ambush . The fire was still increasing . We were all crouched as low as possible . but still keeping up a steady trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Richards . one of the company 's radio operators . Just as I looked back , he moaned softly and fell to the ground . I knelt down and looked at him , and he shud  --  dered and started to gurgle deep in his stomach . His eyes and tongue popped out . and he died . He had a hole straight through his heart . I had been screaming for a medic . I stopped . I looked up . Everyone had stopped . All of a sudden all the snipers opened up with automatic weapons . There were PAVN with machine guns hidden behind every anthill . The noise was deafening . Then the men started dropping , It was unbelievable . I knelt there staring as at least 20 men dropped within a few seconds . I still hail not recovered the shock of seeing Richards killed , but the jolt ol seeing men die so quickly brought me hack to life . I hit the dirt fast . The X0 was to my left , amt Wal  --  lace was to my right , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the tall elephant grass . Men all around me were screaming . The fire was no a continuous roar . We were even being fired at by our own guys . No one knew where the fire was coming from , and so the men were shooting everywhere . Some were in shock and were blazing away at every  --  thing they saw or imagined they saw . The XO let out a low moan . and his head sank . I felt a flash of panic . I had been assuming that he would get us out of this . Enlisted men may scoff at of  --  ficers back in the billets , but when the fighting begins . the men automatically become very dependent upon them . Now I felt terribly alone . The XO had been hit in the small of the back . I ripped off his shirt and there it was : a groove to the right of his spine . The bullet was still in there . He was in a great deal of pain , so a rifleman named Wilson and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandaged his wound . It was not bleeding much on the outside , but he was very close to passing out . Just then Wallace let out a " Huh ! " A bullet had creased his upper arm and entered his side . He was bleeding in spurts . I ripped away his shirt with my knife and did him up . Then the XO screamed : A bullet had gone through his boot . taking all his toes with it . He was in agony and crying . Wallace was swearing and in shock . I was crying and holding on to the XO 's hand to keep from going crazy . The grass in front of Wallace 's head began to fall as if a lawnmower were passing . It was a machine gun , and I could see the vague outline of the Cong 's head behind the foot or so of elephant grass . The noise of firing from all directions was so great that I could n't even hear a machine gun being fired three feet in front of me and one foot above my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my rifle , put it on automatic , pushed the barrel into the Cong 's face and pulled the trigger . I saw his face disappear . I guess I blew his head off , but I never saw his body and did not look for it . Wallace screamed . I had fired the burst pretty close to his ear , but I did n't hit him . Bullets by the thousands were coming from the trees , from the L.Z. , from the very ground , it seemed . There was a huge thump nearby . Bur  --  roughs rolled over and started a scream , though it sounded more like a growl . He had been lying on his side when a grenade went off about three or four feet from him . He looked as though someone had poured red paint over him from head to toe . After that everything began getting hazy . I lay there for several minutes , and I think I was beginning to go into shock . I do n't remember much . The amazing thing about all this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burroughs was hit , only a minute or two had elapsed . Hundreds of men had been hit all around us , and the sound of men screaming was almost as loud as the firing . The XO was going fast . He told me his wife 's name was Carol . He told me that if he did n't make it . I was to write her and tell her that he loved her . Then he somehow managed to crawl away , saying that he was going to organize the troops . It was his positive decision to do something that reinforced my own will to go on . Then our artillery and air strikes started to come in . They saved our lives . Just before they started . I could hear North Vietnamese voices on our right . The PAVN battalion was moving in on us , into the woods . The Sky-raiders were dropping napalm bombs a hundred feet in front of me on a PAVN machine-gun complex . I felt the hot blast and saw the elephant grass curling ahead of me . The victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were trapped outside the wood line . At an altitude of 200 feet it 's diffi  --  cult to distinguish one soldier from an  --  other . It 's unfortunate and horrible , but most of the battalion 's casualties in the first hour or so were from our own men , firing at everything in sight . No matter what you did , you got hit . The snipers in the trees just waited for someone to move , then shot him . I could hear the North Vietnamese enter  --  ing the woods from our right . They were creeping along , babbling and ar  --  guing among themselves , calling to each other when they found a live GI . Then they shot him . I decided that it was time to move . I crawled off to my left a few feet . to where Sgt. Moore and Thompson were lying . Sgt. Moore had been hit in the chest three times . He was in pain and sinking fast . Thompson was hit only lightly in the leg . I asked the sergeant to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dying , but he managed to assure me that everything would be all right . I knew there was n't much chance of that . This was a massacre , and I was one of a handful not yet wounded . All around me. those who were not alreadydead were dying or severely wounded , most of them hit several times . I must have been talking a lot , but I have no idea what I was saying . I think it was , " Oh God , Oh God , Oh God , - over and over . Then I would cry . To get closer to the ground , I had dumped my gear , including the ax I had been carrying . and I had lost my rifle , but that was no problem . There were weapons of every kind lying everywhere . Sgt. Moore asked me if I thought he would make it . I squeezed his hand and told him sure . He said that he was in a lot of pain , and every now and then he would scream . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sure that he would die before the night . had seen his wife and four kids at Fort Benning . He had made it through World War II and Korea , but this little war had got him . I found a hand grenade and put it next to me . Then I pulled out my first-aid pack and opened it . I still was not wounded , but I knew I would be soon . At that instant I heard a babble of Vietnamese voices close by . They sounded like little children , cruel chil  --  dren . The sound of those voices . of the enemy that close , was the most fright  --  ening thing I have ever experienced . Combat creates a mindless fear , but this was worse , naked panic . A small group df PAVN was rap  --  idly approaching . There was a heavy rustling of elephant grass and a constant babbling of high-pitched voices . I told Sgt. Moore to shut up and play dead . I was thinking of using my grenade , but I was scared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so close that 1 would blow myself up too . My mind was made up for me , be  --  cause all of a sudden they were there . I stuck the grenade under my belly so that even if I was hit the grenade would not go off too easily , and if it did go off I would not feel pain . I willed myself to stop shaking , and I stopped breathing . There were about 10 or 12 of them , I figure . They took me for dead , thank God . They lay down all around me , still babbling . One of them lay down on top of me and started to set up his machine gun . He dropped his canister next to my side . His feet were by my head , and his head was between my feet . He was about six feet tall and pretty bony . He probably could n't feel me shaking be  --  cause he was shaking so much himself . thought I was gone . I was trying like hell to act dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on Our mortar platoon , which was set up around a big tree nearby . The platoon returned the fire , killing about half of the Cong , and miraculously not hitting me . All of a sudden a dozen loud " crurnph " sounds went off all around me . Assuming that all the GI 's in front of them were dead , our mortar platoon had opened up with M-79 grenade launchers . The Cong jumped up off me , moaning with fear , and the other PAVN began to move around . They apparently knew the M-79 . Then a second series of explosions went off , killing all the Cong as they got up to run . One grenade landed be  --  tween Thompson 's head and Sgt. Moore 's chest . Sgt. Moore saved my life ; he took most of the shrapnel in his side . A piece got me in the head . It felt as if a white-hot sledge ham  --  mer had hit the right side of my face . Then something hot and stinging hit my left leg . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it feeling intense pain in my leg and a numbness in my head . I did n't dare feel my face : I thought the whole side of it had gone . Blood was pouring down my forehead and filling the hollow of my eyeglasses . It was also pouring out of my mouth . I slapped a bandage on the side of my face and tied it around my head . I was numbed , but I suddenly felt better . It had happened , and I was still alive . I decided it was time to get out . None of my buddies appeared able to move . The Cong obviously had the mortar platoon pegged , and they would try to overrun it again . I was going to be right in their path . I crawled over Sgt. Moore . who had half his chest gone , and Thompson , who had no head left . Wilson , who had helped me with the XO , had been hit badly , but I could n't tell where . All that moved was his eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two canteens I had scrounged . I still had the hand grenade . I crawled over many bodies , all still . The 1st Platoon just did n't exist any  --  more . One guy had his arm blown off . There was only some shredded skin and a piece of bone sticking out of his sleeve . The sight did n't bother me any  --  more . The artillery was still keeping up a steady barrage , as were the planes . and the noise was as loud as ever , but I did n't hear it anymore . It was a miracle did n't get shot by the snipers in the trees while I was moving . As I was crawling around looking for someone alive . I came across Sgt. Barker , who stuck a .45 in my face . He thought I was a Cong and almost shot me . Apparently I was now close to the mortar platoon . Many other wounded men had crawled over there , including the medic Novak , who had run out of supplies after five minutes . Barker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . There were many others . all in bad shape . I lay there with the hand grenade under me. pt:t'utg . The Cone made sevei al mote attacks , which ( ha ' 1111-1:11 oknoon ought oft with ' ti 's . The Cong figured out that Ihe mor  --  tar plat ( xm was right by that tree . and three of their machine-gun crews crawled up and started to ! daze away . It had taken Ihem only a minute or so to Mid exactly where the platoon was ; it took them half a minute to wipe it out . 1Vhen they opened up . I heard a guy close by scream . then another , and another . Every few seconds someone would scream . Some got hit several times . In 30 seconds the platoon was virtualb . IInmt.xislcitt. 1 heard 1.1 . Sheldon scream three Limes , but he I think only live or six guys from the platoon were alive the next day . It also seemed that most of them were hit in the belly . I do n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie screams an unearthly scream . Some  --  thing you can not imagine ; you actually have to hear it . When a man is hit in the chest or the belly , he keeps on scream  --  ing , sometimes until he dies . I just lay there , numb , listening to the bullets whining over me and the 15 or 20 men close to me screaming and screaming and screaming . They did n't ever stop for breath . They kept on until they were hoarse , then they would bleed through their mouths and pass out . They would wake up and start scream  --  ing again . Then they would die . I started crying . Sgt. Gale was lying near me . He had been hit badly in the stomach and was in great pain . He would lie very still for a while and then scream . He would scream for a doctor , then he would scream for a medic . He pleaded with anyone he saw to help him , for the love of God , to stop his pain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and then lie still for a while . He was bleeding a lot . Everyone was . No matter where you put your hand , the ground was sticky . Sgt. Gale lay there for over six hours before he died . No'one had any medi  --  cal supplies , no one could move , and no one would shoot him . Several guys shot themselves that day . Schiff , although he was not wounded , completely lost his head and killed himself with his own grenade . Two other men , both wounded , shot themselves with .45 's rather than let themselves be captured alive by the gooks . No one will ever know how many chose that way out , since all the dead had been hit over and over again . All afternoon we could hear the PAVN , a whole battalion , running through the grass and trees . Hundreds of GI 's were scattered on the ground like salt . Sprinkled among them like pepper were the wounded and dead Cong . The GI 's who were wounded badly were screaming for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All afternoon there was smoke , ar  --  tillery , screaming , moaning , fear . bul  --  lets , blood , and little yellow men run  --  ning around screeching with glee when they found one of us alive . or screaming and moaning with fear when they ran into a grenade or a bullet . I suppose that all massacres in wars are a bloody mess , but this one seemed bloodier to me because I was caught in it . About dusk a few helicopters tried landing in the L.Z .. about 40 yards over to the left . but whenever one came within 100 feet of the ground , so many machine guns would open up on him that it sounded like a training company at a machine-gun range ; At dusk the North Vietnamese started to mortar us . Some of the mortars they used were ours that they had captured . Suddenly the ground behind me lifted up , and there was a tremendous noise . I knew something big had gone off right behind me . At the same time I felt something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and screaming . The pain was terrible . Then I said . " My legs , God , my legs , " over and over . Still screaming . I ripped the bandage off my face and tied it around my thigh . It did n't fit , so I held it as tight as I could with my fingers . I could feel the blood pouring out of the hole . I cried and moaned . It was hurting un  --  believably . The realization came to me now , for the first time , that I was not going to live . With hardly any light left , the Cong decided to infiltrate the woods thor  --  oughly . They were running everywhere . There were no groupings of Americans left in the woods . just a GI here and there . The planes had left , but the ar  --  tillery kept up the barrage . Then the flares started up . As long as there was some light , the Cong would n't try an all-out attack . I was lying there in a stupor , thirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been Mievnoon %kith 110 Water , sv , c ; iimg lib 11,41. 1 1,1 chance o cigarette . All n 11 equipment and but ? . somehow my were still with ow , The ends were blihndy. 1 lore off the ends and lit the middle part of cigarette , Cupping it and blowing away the smoke , I managed to escape detection . knew I was a fool . But at this stage I did n't really give a damn . By now the small-arms lire had stopped almost en  --  tirely . Thu woods were left to the dead , the wounded , and the artillery barrage . At nightfall I had crawled across to where Barker , Caine and a few others were lying . I did n't say a word . I just lay there on my back , listening to the swishing of grass . the sporadic fire and the constant artillery , which was com  --  mg owl l y close . For over six hours nine shells boil been landing within a hun  --  dred v , irds of me. didn'l naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a canteen of water . The guy who hail taken the last drink from it must have been hit in the face , because the water was about one third blood . I did n't mind . I passer it around . About an hour after dark there was a heavy concentration of small-arms ( ire all around us . It lasted about five minutes . It was repeated at intervals all night long . Battalion HQ was firing a protective fire , and we were right in the path of the bullets . Some of our men were getting hit by the rounds ricocheting through the woods . lay there shivering . At night in the highlands the temperature goes down or so . Allow midnight I heard Illy grass swishing . It was men , and a lot of them too . I took my hand gre  --  nade and straightened out the pin . thought to myself that now at last they were going to come and kill all the wounded that were left . I was sure I was going to die , and I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take me alive . The others around me were either unconscious or did n't care . They were just lying there . I think most of them had quietly died in the last few hours . I know one -I did not recognize him- - wanted to he alone to die . When he felt himself going , he crawled over me II do n't know how ) , and a few minutes later I heard him gurgle , and , I guess . die . Then suddenly 1 realized that the men were making little whistling noises . Maybe these were n't the Cong . A few seconds later a patrol of fi I 's came into view , about 15 guys in line , looking for wounded . Everyone started pawing toward them and crying . It turned me into a babbling idiot . I grabbed one of the guys and would n't let go . They had four stretchers with them , and they took the four worst wounded and all the walking wounded , about 11 ) or so , from the company . I was desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when Peters helped me to my feet , I pas , wd out cold . When I regained consciousness , they had gone , but their medic was left be  --  hind , a few feet from me , by a tree . He had n't seen me , and had already used his meager supply of bandages on those guys w1-1 , , had crawled up around the tree . I lis patrol said Hay would be back in a few hours . I clung to the hope . kit I knew damn well they were n't coming back . Novak , who was one of the walking wounded , had left me his .45 . I lost one of the magazines , and the only other one had only three bullets in it . I still had the hand grenade . I Crawled up to the tree . There were about eight guys there , all badly wounded . Lt. Sheldon was there , and he had the only operational radio left in the company . I could n't hear him , but he was talking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lt. Sheldon had been wounded in the thighbone. , the kneecap and the ankle . Some time after midnight , in my half-conscious stupor , I heard a lot of rustling on both sides of the tree . I nudged the lieutenant , and then he heard it too . Slowly , everyone who could move started to arm himself . I do n't know who it was  --  it might even have been me  --  but someone made a noise with a weapon . The swishing noise stopped immedi  --  ately . Ten yards or so from us an excited babbling started . The gooks must have thought they had run into a pocket of resistance around the tree . Thank God they did n't dare rush us , because we would n't have lasted a sec  --  ond . Half of us were too weak to even cock our weapons . As a matter of fact , there were a couple who did not have lingers to cock with . Then a clanking noise started : They were setting up a machine gun right next to us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every'few seconds they seemed to creep closer to us , until one of the Cong screamed . Then the babbling grew louder . I heard the lieutenant on the radio ; he was requesting a salvo to bracket us . A few seconds later there was a loud whistling in the air and shells were landing all around us , again and again . I heard the Cong run away . They left some of their wounded a couple of yards from us , moaning and screaming . but they died within a few minutes . Every half hour or so the artillery would start all over again . It was a long night . Every time , the shells came so close to our position that we could hear the shrapnel striking the tree a foot or so above our heads , and could hear other pieces humming by just inches over us . All night long the Cong had been moving around killing the wounded . Every few minutes I heard some guy start screaming , " No no no please , " and then a burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd make an awful racket . They 'd yell for their buddies and babble awhile , then turn the poor devil over and listen to him while they stuck a barrel in his face and squeezed . About an hour before dawn the ar tillery stopped , except for an occasional shell . But the small-arms firing started up again , just as heavy as it had been the previous afternoon . The GI 's about a mile away were advancing and clear  --  ing the ground and trees of Cong and a few Americans tool . The snipers , all around the trees and in them , started firing back . When a bullet is fired at you , it makes a distinctive , sharp , cracking sound . The firing by the GI 's was all cracks . I could hear thuds all around me from the bullets . I thought I was all dried out from bleeding and sweating , but now I started sweating all over again . 1 thOught , How futile it would be to die now from an American bullet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think some guy near me got hit . He let out a long sigh and gurgled . Soon the sky began to turn red and orange . There was complete silence everywhere now . Not even the birds started their usual singing . As the sun was coming up , everyone expected a human-wave charge by the PAVN , and then a total massacre . We did n't know that the few Cong left from the battle had pulled out just before dawn , leaving only their wounded and a few suicide squads behind . When the tight grew stronger , I could see all around rne . The scene might have been the devil 's butcher shop . There were dead men all around the tree . I found that the dead body I had been resting my head on was that of Burgess , one of my buddies . I could hardly recognize him . He was a pro  --  fessional saxophone player with only two weeks left in the Army . Right in front of me was Sgt. De  --  laney with both his legs blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  out knowing who he was . His eyes were open and covered with dirt . Sgt. Gale was dead too . Most of the dead were unrecognizable and were beginning to stink . There was blood and mess all over the place . Half a dozen of the wounded were alive . Lord , who was full of shrapnel ; Lt. Sheldon. with several bullet wounds ; Morris , shut in the legs and arm ; Sloan , with his lingers shot off ; Olson , with his leg shot up and hands muti  --  lated ; and some guy from another company who was holding his guts from falling out . Dead Cong were hanging out of the trees everywhere . The Americans had lired bursts that had blown some snipers right out of the trees . But these guys , they were just hanging and dangling there in silence . We were all sprawled out in various stages of unconsciousness . My wounds had started bleeding again , and the heat was getting bad . The ants were getting to my legs . Lt. Sheldon passed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning is rather blurred in my memory . I re  --  member talking for a long time with someone from Battalion Hq . He kept telling me to keep calm , that they would have the medics and helicop  --  ters in there in no time . He asked me about the condition of the wounded . I told him that the few who were still alive would n't last long . I listened for a long time on the radio to chit  --  chat between MedEvac pilots , Air Force jet pilots and Battalion Hy . Every now and then I would call up and ask when they were going to pick us up . I 'm sure I said a lot of other things , but I do n't remember much about it . I just could n't understand at first why the MedEvacs did n't come in and get us . Finally I heard on the radio that they would n't land because no one knew whether or not the area was se  --  cure . Some of the wounded guys were beginning to babble . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force spotter plane was buzzing overhead . It dropped a couple of flares in the L.Z. nearby , marking the spot for an airstrike . I thought , My God , the strike is going to land on top of us . I got through to the old man  --  the company commander  --  who was up ahead . and he said that it would n't come near us and for us not to worry . But I worried , and it landed pretty damn close . There was silence for a while , then they started hitting the L.Z. with artil  --  lery. a lot of it . This tasted for a half hour or so , and then the small arms started again , whistling and buzzing through the woods . I was terrified . I thought . My Lord , is this never going to end ? If we 're going to die , let 's get it over with . Finally the firing stopped , and there was a ghastly silence . Then the old man got on the radio again and talked to me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our area . I talked to thepilot , directing him , until he said he could see me . Some of the wounded saw the chopper and started yelling , " Medic , Medic . " Others were moaning feebly and struggling to wave at the chopper . The old man saw the helicopter cir  --  cling and said he was coming to help us . He asked me to throw a smoke grenade , which I pulled off Lt. Shel  --  don 's gear . I t went off . and the old man saw it , because soon after that I heard the guys coming . They were shooting as they walked along . I screamed into the radio , " Do n't shoot , do n't shoot , " but they called back and said they were just shooting PAVN . Then I saw them : The 1st sergeant , our captain and the two radio opera  --  tors . The captain came up to me and asked me how I was . I said to him : " Sorry , Sir , I lost my ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smitty , we 'll get you another one . " The medics at the L.Z. cut off my boots and put bandages on me . My wouhds were in pretty bad shape . You know what happens when you take raw meat and throw it on the ground on a sunny day . We were out there for 24 hours , and Vietnam is nothing but one big anthill . I was put in a MedEvac chopper and flown to Pleiku. where they changed dressings and stuck all sorts of tubes in my arms . At Pleiku I saw Gruber briefly . He was a clerk in the battalion , and my Army buddy . We talked until they put me in the plane . I learned that Stern and Deschamps , close friends , had been found dead together . shot in the backs of their heads , executed by the Cong . Gruber had identified their bodies . Everyone was crying . Like most of the men in our battalion , I had lost all my Army friends . I heard the casualty figures a few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 500 dead . Out of some 500 men in our battalion alone , about 150 had been killed , and only 84 returned to base tamp a few days later . In my company , which was right in the middle of the ambush , we had 93-percent casualties  --  one half dead , one half wounded . Almost all the wounded were crippled for life . The company , in fact , was very nearly an  --  nihilated . Our unit is part of the 7th Cavalry  --  Custer 's old unit . That day in the la Drang Valley , history repeated itself . After a week in and out of field hos  --  pitals I ended up at Camp Zama in Japan . They have operated on me twice . They tell me that I 'll walk again , and that my legs are going to be fine . But no one can tell me when I will stop hav  --  ing nightmares . Jack Smith did recover from his wounds and was sent back to his unit in Vietnam , where he served as a supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see any more action . Smith is now training recruits at Fort Dix , N.J. q
