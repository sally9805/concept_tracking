THE SONS OF MARTHA A Story by Richard McKenna On that ship they did not have bunks and the sailors slept on brown canvas Army cots . In the tropics it was too hot to sleep in the crew 's compartment amidships , so they set up their cots on the well decks . Every day at one o'clock they would go to the cot locker in the glory hale and bring up their cots and lay them , still folded , to claim a place . They all tried to find sheltered places , but there were not enough sheltered places to go around . The rule of the ship was that a place belonged to the man who got there first on that day . No man could know in the morning where he would sleep that night or whether or not he would be rained upon in his sleep . In his first days aboard , Reed Kinburn did not try very hard for one of the sheltered places . He did not talk very much to anyone . In Port Valdez it rained once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes fell upon one end of the ship and not upon the other . Green hills and darker green mangrove swamps ringed half of Port Valdez , with no buildings or any other sign of man visible . Kinburn liked that . The other half was a curving reef upon which the great Pacific swells broke all day and all night in a crested , tumbling line of white water athwart the blue vastness . The reef was a living thing of coral and on the darkest nights the line of breakers along it was still a ghostly white from living phosphorescence in the broken water . The rolling , washing sound of it came gentled by distance to be a part of all the sailors ' talking and also of their silences . In his first days Kinburn spent much time looking at the reef and at the calm water on the hither side of it . No other ship rode at anchor there . The water was blue shading into green dappled with lighter greens that became almost a milkiness where coral heads neared the surface . The color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was always a pattern ? 1967 by Eva McKenna . and always beautiful . Beyond the reef were only and always the blue swells like titanic muscles working blindly , lifting and coming , endlessly from over the world 's edge . " You ought to see it in a typhoon sometime , kid , " an older sailor told him once sardonically . The ship was painted gray , or war color , as the sailors called it , in unconscious memory of a time long past when white had been peace color . The sides were waist-high steel bulwarks pierced here and there with hawse and scupper holes and square freeing ports with bars across them . There were no guns mounted anywhere about the decks . There was no strain and no pain and it was all somehow connected with the fact that she was station ship for the Navy island of Levanoa . The island was larger and more populous than the solitude of Port Valdez seemed to indicate . During the lazy afternoons the ship 's boats took liberty parties up a hidden channel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dottie 's . From there a road led to a much larger village where there were supposed to be several drinking places . Few of the sailors bothered to go ashore and Kinburn did not go at all , for a certain familiar old reason . To him still the most special thing about the ship was that she was his first ship and that he had fallen in love with her name before he had ever seen her . As with all Navy supply ships , she was named after a star , and all those names were good ones , but Stella Maris had seemed to Kinburn the finest one of all from the first time he read it , typed opposite his name on a transfer list at Goat Island . He did nut yet know what he thought about the ship herself . The movie that night was Janet Gaynor in something very sentimental that made the sailors jeer at intervals . Kinburn watched it lying on his back on No. 4 cargo hatch , his head pillowed on his folded-up cot After the movie he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead he unfolded his cot and sat on it . He was fighting a small , familiar old battle with himself . " Come on back and have a soda pop , Kinburn , " Thorpe said , passing . " Evergreen 's buying for the gang . " " No , thanks . Do n't feel like one , " Kinburn said . On the poop deck light gleamed through the window of the ship 's service store , which was always opened right after the movies . Inside , a swarthy little seaman was selling ice cream and soda pop and candy bars . The sailors moving by him , going back there , were still mostly without names or faces for Kinburn . They were just men in dungarees and Asiatic undershirts and tattoos and all knowing each other but not him . Ile knew only a few of them to speak to , Thorpe and Evergreen , and the big fireman Roach , who had been assigned to break him in to his fireroom duties . Kinburn had not reached out very far for friendship . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had come aboard all by himself rather than with a draft of other new men and word had spread from the ship 's office that he had been a hospital apprentice before his rating was changed to fireman third class . Both facts were enough to single him out sharply . They did not know yet where he would shake down to in their tight little universe . But all they saw when they glanced at him was a slender , wiry , brown-haired young man in regulation undershirt and dungarees sitting quietly on his cut . Nothing of the struggle within him showed on his smooth boy 's face , unless it was a tense look of his mouth or the bunched muscle along the clean lines of his jaw . He felt ashamed to have to fight himself over such a small thing as a candy bar . His rule was that he would have one every third night , and this was the third night , but the last time he had gone up there the devil of his yearning had overcome him and he had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip . You could only buy with paper tickets which came in booklets , and the swarthyRichard McKenna 's first novel , " The Sand Pebbles , " won the Harper Prize in 1963 and is now released in movie form . The author died in November 1964 leaving the manuscript of " The Sons of Martha and Other Stories , " from which this one is adapted . The book will be published in March by Harper &; Row . McKenna was born in Idaho and served for twenty-two years in the Navy . He retired in 1952 , took an A.B . at the University of North Carolina , and began his writing career in his forties . seaman had to tear them out of your book himself or they were no good , It was very easy in the sight and smell of it all to blurt out , " Make that two , " and then be ashamed to countermand the order . Voices and laughter came from the poop deck . Gyp Joint , the sailors called that shack , and Gyp Joint was the nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gyp Joint , open up l " they would yell at him sometimes during the lazy afternoons . Finally the lights went out back there and Kinburn relaxed his jaw . Men spread cots roundabout , rolled out bedding , and turned in . Kinburn thought on into the darkness , under the large stars . If only the Stella . Maris did not have that gyp joint , he thought , it would be all right . It was far better than Mare Island , which was loaded with gyp joints and where you had to pay a dime to see the movies . Not yet had he escaped that thing which had always been an ache and later had become a shame to him as well . Once he had thought to escape at sixteen , when he became strong enough to do a man 's work . Tomorrow he would be twenty , and he was very strong and enduring , but he still had not escaped .... " K inborn . That you , Kinburn ? " It was Roach . His thick fingers masked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kinburn . Come below . I got the watch . " " What is it ? " " Come on down . There 's coffee . I got some sugar . " They had to go through the engine room , down two ladders , and into a tunnel between the boilers . It was hot and steamy in the engine room . A clatter and groaning of pumps and the hum of the generator drowned out the sound of the reef . The fire-room was more open and clear of jumbled metal and the smell there was clean and sharp of fuel oil . " Pour me a cup , too , " Roach said . " I 'll be right over . " The coffee was in an aluminum pitcher on the steel workbench . The cups were really thick white porcelain soup bowls from the crew 's mess and they always had oily fingermarks on them . Kin-burn stirred three spoons of sugar into his own coffee . Roach was at the other end of the long , narrow space adjusting the fire in the middle furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big boilers could make enough steam for port use . Roach was bent and squinting through the peephole while he jiggled the diffuser to make the flame as clean as he could . The three big Scotch 66 THE SONS OF MARTHA boilers side by side looked to Kinburn like three huge and menacing faces . That was because their upper portions beetled forward to overhang the floor plates . Three cleanout doors on each one , painted aluminum , made two eyes and a longer , narrower nose beaking down between them . Beneath each door a circular furnace front , the middle one lower than those on either side , made an upward-curving mouth . To Kinburn it looked like the smirk on the face of a cannibal . Roach came over and took his coffee . He was hig and hearty , with coarse features and coarse black hair , and something was on his mind that . he could not say easily . " We clean firesides on number three tomorrow , " he began . " You and me and Rothrock got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kinburn nodded . Flangeface Hogan was the water tender first class in charge of the fireroom . He was an older man with a face very like the boiler faces and he seldom spoke . Kinburn feared and disliked him and he had vowed silently that he would never wait on Flangeface and bring him coffee , as the other firemen did . Yet Flangeface had never once spoken to him and hardly seemed to see him . Roach was watching Kinburn for a reaction . Kinburn did not reveal any . " How far you been in school , did you say ? " Roach asked . " Finished high school . " " No college ? " " Me college ? Hell , no ! " " What it takes down here in the stokehole is a strong back and a weak mind . " Roach was nodding approvingly , but they had been through that before . Something else was on Roach 's mind . " I hear scuttlebutt you just changed your rate over from hosapp , " Roach said bluntly . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented them . The sailors called them pecker checkers and chancre mechanics and pretended to doubt that they were really men . In the short time that he had been a common sailor himself Kinburn had already begun to sympathize with their attitude . " I did n't change my rate , " Kinburn said with difficulty . " They changed it for me . " " I did n't mean nothing , only wondering was it true . And how come they done it to you . " " Roosevelt done it , same time he cut the pay , " Kinhurn said . " He kicked the veterans out of Navy hospitals . Then all husapps second had to change over to seaman or fireman or else take a special order discharge . " " You did n't want a discharge , huh ? " " Christ , no ! " Kinburn slopped coffee and Roach laughed . " In Frisco I seen ' em sleeping in doorways and eating out of garbage cans , " Kinburn said . " Roach , you guys out here just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Roach grinned . " We know , all right . " It made a sudden bond between them . They talked about the pay cut . It was really harder on the petty officers , Roach said . They lost all their longevity too , and 15 per cent of their base pay was a bigger bite . Flangeface was losing $34 a month . But of course he still has $71 a month left . Kinburn was only losing $5.40 a month , but he felt a twinge of envy for Flangeface . " Well , us third-class snipes still get our dollar a day , " Roach said . " One day , one dollar , what the hell ? " he shrugged . " Dollar a day , jolly good pay , lucky to touch it ? " Kinburn broke off the quote . " I just wish I did have a dollar a day , " he finished bitterly . " Got an allotment , huh ? " " Yeah . " He did not say how much , but when the first pay list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $13 a month to keep himself decent in the world . He could no longer buy used clothing cheaply , from sailors being medically surveyed , as he had done at Mare Island . On the other hand , in Port Valdez he did not have to fight the constant lure of liberty . He did not know yet how he was going to make out with it . " Sometimes I help my old man out with a fin . I got a big brother on the railroad helps too , " Roach said . " I do n't believe in allotments . Once you start one , they say the paymaster wo n't let you stop it without you got permission from the other end . " " I ai n't got an old man . All I got is a mother and some little brothers . " " Geez , that is tough ! " Roach shook his head . " I heard about guys , their mothers wrote to their skippers , and their skippers ordered them to make out allotments . " " I seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe they 'll open up rates next quarter . This guy Roosevelt ? " " He 's the son of a bitch closed ' em ! " Kinburn broke in . He scowled . Roach was scowling too . " If they do open up rates , them college bastards will get ' em all , " he said bitterly . " Them brain trusters down in the ice plant . " They poured themselves more coffee . Roach sighed deeply . " Well , hell ! " he said . " Well , about firesides tomorrow . Come down in your oldest suit of whites and white hat . After tomorrow they wo n't be no good for anything else . " " Pretty dirty job , eh ? " " Hall ! You got no idea ! But it 's more than the dirt and it 's more than the work . It gets you another way the first time . That 's what I wanted to tell you . You 're kind of high-strung , I thought . . . well ... " " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to say it . " It gets inside of you and underneath of you someway , " he said . " The first time I cleaned firesides I thought T was gon na die in there . " He shook his head and grimaced . " Might be easier if you 're braced for it . So I wanted to tell you . " " Well , thanks . " Kinburn was wondering if it might not be a joke buildup , the way hospital corpsmen scared recruits with references to the square needle and the shot in the left testicle . He decided that it was not . " Well , thanks , " he repeated . " I 'll make out . " " Soon as we finish and clean up we always go over to Mama Lottie 's and drink beer till midnight , " Roach said . " It goes on Flangeface 's bill , that 's how he wants it . So we always work like hell . We try to get over there early and cost Flangeface all the beer we can , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beer , " Kinburn said . He was finishing the last of his coffee , rolling it with his tongue , tasting the sugar . " Well , maybe I better go turn in , " he said . " First tell me how come you picked being a snipe instead of a deck ape . " " I had a chance to buy a dress white jumper for half a buck from a guy getting surveyed , " Kinburn said . " It already had a red watch mark on it . So . .. " He shrugged and grinned . Roach laughed heartily . " Tomorrow you gon na really gut-hate that guy for not having a blue watch mark , " he said . You gon na figure that half a dollar bought you the worst deal in your whole life . " " Listen , Roach . I want to tell you something , " Kinburn said . " You do n't have to believe it , but I want to tell you . " Roach sobered . " I made out my allotment of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice before they changed my rate I put in myself to have it changed to seaman and they turned me down . I wanted to go to sea , to get the hell away from there . " " I believe you . " " Well , good night , then . " " Good night . Hope it do n't rain . " Kinburn ate breakfast in undress whites spotless and smoothly ironed , just as they had come last from the hospital laundry . He had cut the reda story by Richard McKenna 67 cross striker 's badge off his sleeve , but much laundering had left two pink impressions of it stained indelibly into the fabric . He was not wearing underwear or socks , because he did not want to ruin any more clothing than he could help . Roach and Rothrock , at the same table , wore undress whites mottled yellow and brown and with dungaree-cloth patches on knees and elbows . There was much joking talk about how rough it was cleaning firesides , none of it addressed directly to Kinburn , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him covertly except Flangeface Hogan , sitting at the head of the table . Hogan was a big , dark , slow-moving man with absolutely no play of expression across his heavy face . His deep , slow voice seemed to come out of his barrel chest and there was never any tonal expression in it . He would probably announce that the ship was sinking in the same way that he asked for the salt . As always , he wore bleached dungarees and a blue-piped Asiatic undershirt and polished black shoes . Flangeface Hogan seemed not to know that Kinburn existed . In the fireroom Roach was aloof again , as if the friendly talk of the night before had not taken place . The three fireside cleaners stood back against the workbench while the rest of the gang rigged a scaffold in front of No. 3 boiler , Some of them handed the rough , blackened planks down a trunked hatchway from the starboard bunker . Others took the small register doors off the three furnace fronts and pulled out the cone-shaped diffusers . Still others were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They worked with a jump and a drive unlike anything Kinburn had seen on the ship before . Skip Lea , the nervous little second class who straw-bossed the gang work , kept shouting at them . " Higher ! Pull them doors level , now ! " The cleanout doors were hinged at the top and they swung out like three canopies above the scaffold . They revealed vertical tube sheets , three solid arrays of two-inch tube ends , all clustery black with soot . A haze of dislodged soot seemed to hang in the air above the scaffold . In the clean distance beside the fuel-oil heaters Flangeface Hogan stood watching . Skip Lea jumped up and clown on the scaffold to test its solidity . He was a gingery , redheaded , sharp-featured little man in dungarees and he already had a powdering of soot on him . He jumped down with a clatter . " Now , then , you firesiders ! Over the top ! " he yelled . Roach and Rothroek jumped for the scaffold . 68 THE SONS OF MARTHA Kinburn climbed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mock-cockney accent , " Eye n't it a chyme ? Eye n't it a chyme ' . " The center tube sheet had fallen to Kinburn . His array was longer than those on the sides , but not as wide , and it had the same number of tubes . The work itself was easy at first . Their brooms brought the soot down in soundless slithers and fine clouds that made Kinburn cough . The soot lay so lightly on his white jumper that he could blow a spot perfectly clean with his breath but wherever he touched it , however lightly , it would smear an inky black . The metal under the soot was a reddish-orange . " That 's corrosion , from the sulfuric acid , " Roth-rock told Kinburn . " You want to wire-brush good around them tube ends . " The corrosion came off in reddish dust . Kinb urn finished his tube sheet at the same time as the others . He kept coughing . Punching tubes was harder work . Each tube was furred thickly inside with soot and half-full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the tubes and had to be forced into them by pushing and turning to compress the springy coils . The brushes were mounted on heavy steel rods about ten feet long and they had to be pushed all the way through until they came out the other end , inside the combustion chamber , where the soot fell . It was very hard work pushing the brush in but it came back quite easily and came out with a puff of fine soot . Kinburn found that he could not punch a tube as fast as the other two men . His brush would scrape along a few inches under a hard push , sending a vibration thrilling back to his hands through the steel rod . Roach and Rothrock sent their brushes through with long , easy-looking heaves and they had breath enough to spare for joking with each other past Kinburn working silently and with set teeth between them . They joked about how much beer they were going to drink on Flangcface . Under their turned-down white hats their faces were black with soot , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Ezra , and Roach was making a joke of it . " Izz-rah ! " he would roar , grimacing his whole black face and baring all his teeth on the Izz , gaping his mouth cavernously on the rah . " Izz-rah ! " " All right , Cocky Roach . All right , Bugfeller , " Rothrock would say . " Punch tubes , you ridge-runner ! " And they did punch tubes , drawing steadily ahead of Kinburn . He poured in all the strength he had , panting and coughing and feeling sweattrickle down his back and legs . It was no use . He had about thirty tubes left to go when the others finished . " Let 's take a blow and have some coffee , " Roth-rock told Roach . " We can still sweep out combustion chambers before chow . " " Sure enough , we gon na make that three o'clock boat , Izz-rah . " Kinburn drove himself on . When his arms became too heavy and numb he would let them hang and jerk and turn them until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close his fists all the way he would seize the rod and drive the brush with angry lunges through another two or three tubes . He saw Roach and Rothrock crawl into their respective furnaces through the small access holes . Then helpers pulled burlap sack after sack of soot out of those holes and took them away somewhere . The soot came right through the mesh of the burlap , each sack trailing a cloud , and the powdery soot haze filled the fireroom even to where Flange-face Hogan stood silently watching . Kinburn was groggy and he almost fell when he climbed down at last from the scaffold . He took a drink of water from the bucket on the workbench . A scum of soot floated on the water . His hands were a shiny black . He blew his nose on a piece of cleaning rag and the stuff was jet black . Kinburn wished that he had not learned so much , as a hospital corpsman , about the structure of the human lung . He could not keep his mind off the thousandfold branching passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take five , " Skip Lea told him . " Have a cup of joe . " " No . I 'm rested and I want to catch up , " Kin-burn said . " What do 1 do next , inside there ? " Lea squinted an eye . " Maskee , if you want to , " he said . " I 'll tell you what you do . " The furnace proper was a steel tube about thirty inches in diameter and eight feet long . It was shallowly corrugated , like a bellows tube , and the name for it was corrugation . Kinburn felt carbon grit and crunch beneath him as he crawled through it trailing the cord of a portable electric I i ght . The outside men were pushing his other gear in behind him and he reached back for the broom . A massively rounded steel collar made an orifice into the combustion chamber . Soot was banked high in there and spilling out into the corrugation . It would be thigh-deep . It was so soft and light that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel his feet sink in . It moved in a sluggish cloud rising that he could not feel . He thrust a wire-brush handle into one of the tube ends above his head and hung his light from it but the light did not illuminate anything . It did not reveal any form or outline . Blackness soaked up the light and did not let it come back . Very faintly he could see blobs and masses of soot hanging all around above him . His motions had stirred the soot and the tide was rising above his shoulders . It had no substance . It was just blackness . It was just air stained black and choking , and the blackness was thicker at the bottom but it was rising to stop his breath and dim his eyes , and his heart was sledging away like a steam pump . Then a clear , certain little voice inside his head spoke with the authority of God Almighty Get out of here . Fast . Now . His legs tried to obey but his arms fought it madly with the broom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cursing in panic torn between them , and the blackness swirled about his face until his light was a lost red spark , Slithering , whispering , patting gently his face and hands , blackness descended upon hini , and he bit his curses into its sour nothingness until his frantic broom swept light back into that place in reddish-brown walls and angles and rows of rivet heads that gave the light back to his clamoring eyes . He dropped his broom . He was all right now . He knew what Roach had meant . His stomach rose up and he retched and heaved . Nothing came but a little sour water . It left him weak and shaky , but he knew that he was all right . He knew the blackness had reached and stained indelibly the least , last , tiniest , most hidden and remote alveolar pocket within him . He had nothing left him to protect against the blackness , and he would be all right now . He filled the sacks with a dustpan . The soot came right back out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he tied them shut , although it had no weight . When the mess cook brought chow down for the firesiders Kinburn said he would wait until he finished filling sacks . He caught a glimpse of Roach and Rothrock eating at the workbench . They were absolutely black and exuberant as ever . Before Kinburn was ready to eat they had gone back in and he could hear the clink of their chipping hammers in the corrugations on either side of his own . " Hand me the chow in , " he told them outside . " I 'll eat it in here . " Crouching awkwardly in there he wolfed the food , his black hands turning the bread black on its way to the blackness of his mouth . He wanted to save a few minutes on eating time . a story by Richard McKenna 69 He wire-brushed the combustion chamber in a driving fury , his ears sharp for the continuing hammer clinks of the other two . He brushed with his left hand when his right arm failed him , so that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning the corrugation at last , he could still hear the hammer clinks . It was hard carbon rather than soot , and it was crusted rather loose and crumbly . A few strokes with his chipping hammer would break up a section and then his scraper could bite into it . He found a way both to press and to push with the heel of his left hand on the butt end of his file scraper , while he pulled with his right hand , and he could bring the carbon showering off in coarse flakes . Then a few vigorous strokes with the big wire brush would leave the surface a smooth , clean black . It was very awkward working in that cramped space , but the steady work noises from either side kept Kinburn feverishly at it . He was about three-quarters done with it when the noises stopped . Then he listened for the voices out there , gathering that Flangeface was inspecting the two wing furnaces . He heard a whoop from Roach . " Okay , tzz-rah ! Let 's hit the beach ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive himself faster . When he had finished he swept the coarse stuff into a sack and dropped it outside without calling for someone to take it . He threw all his gear out clattering on the floor plates , all but his light , which he left gleaming on the clean , corrugated surface . Then he crawled out painfully himself and stood there panting . He was guessing it had been about twenty minutes since the others had gone up . No one was in the fireroom except Skip Lea and the fireman on watch . Lea came up . He had a strange , quizzical look on his sharp features . " Giving up , Kinburn ? " he asked . " Had enough for today , have you ? " " I had enough , all right , but I ai n't giving up , " Kinburn said . " I 'm through . It 's clean in there . " " Make finish , hey ? " Lea sounded surprised and doubtful . He looked into the corrugation , then turned to face Kinburn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maskee , " he said suddenly , after a moment . " I 'll go get Flangeface . " Kinburn sat down wearily on the stacked planks from the dismantled scaffold . They were hard and splintery and black as the hand with which Kin-burn caressed the top one . His mind wandered off to a thought of timbered hillsides and a sawmill he remembered , of moist white planks and the smell of fresh sawdust . Trees fell over and rotted back into the ground , he thought . But these planks were 70 THE SONS OF MARTHA dry and black and hard and they could endure forever . Skip Lea hit the floor plates with a bang and Flangeface Hogan came soberly behind him . He did not look at Kinburn and he scarcely more than glanced into the corrugation . " It ai n't clean , " he told Lea . That was all . He turned and walked ponderously away . Kinburn found himself standing with fists clenched and wanting to scream savagely at that broad back going away from him . But no words came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finding his voice at last . That son of a bitch ! " he said . " Why ai n't it clean ? God damn it , you tell me why it ai n't clean ! " Skip Lea looked uncomfortable . " You only got off the crusted stuff , " he said . That underneath is the real carbon , and all you done was polish it up with your wire brush . " He could see that Kin-burn did not believe him . " It 's baked on there almost like paint , " Lea said . " You got to chip and scrape it off like it was paint . " It was in his stomach and bowels that Kinburn could not believe it . He licked his lips , holding Lea 's eye . " It ai n't going to end the world for nobody if you let the rest of it go till tomorrow , " Skip Lea said . " If you had enough for today , just say so . " Kinburn was getting hold of it . Tight-lipped still , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cleaned ? " he asked tautly . " Is there more to do in them tomorrow ? " " No more cleaning . " " Then I 'll finish mine . " " Maskee , if you want to . " Skip Lea shrugged . " You can quit whenever you figure you had enough . " He had to fight for every square inch of dull gray metal cleaned of carbon . He had poured out his strength too lavishly too early and he had none left for this hardest part of all . It was too narrow in there to sit upright and he could not work his arms properly when he lay flat . He had constantly to brace himself in some awkward position and to straighten his legs convulsively when a cramp took the muscles . His knees and elbows hurt him . He could see a score of places where on the first cleaning his hammer had broken through to true metal , and he could not understand why he had not seen it then . Recurrently the conviction came that he could not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogan . There was no decency or feeling or fairness in Flangeface Hogan . He wassome kind of mute , brute animal with arms like human thighs and a hump of muscle on the back of his neck . The tube was like a steel bellows , successive hollows and humps ringing him round , with nowhere a flat surface . Each blow of his chipping hammer powdered carbon away only along the narrow line of impact . He beat out a narrow line from one hollow up the gentle slope and down into the next hollow . Four inches away he beat out a parallel line . Then he joined their ends with beaten gray lines like streams along the valleys and he had a four-inch square blocked out . It did not seem very big . He rough-chipped the square and cleaned it off with h the scraper . The clean gray metal looked won and set apart and good to him . He started another line parallel to its edge and four inches away . The squares end to end followed the gentle hill up the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion . Each square in itself was not a hard job . Isolating a portion of the carbon weakened its power to discourage him . When Kinburn finished the first half of the hill the second half seemed to go easier , as if the clean gray surface wanted now to meet itself around the circle , to close the black gap separating its ends . Twenty-four of the squares cleared one hill around the circuit . Twenty-four hills comprised the whole corrugation , It began to seem humanly possible . He broke new ground on the next hill . Then Skip Lea called in . " Four o'clock , Kinburn . Time to knock off . " " I got a little patch to finish , " Kinburn said . He meant to finish only the square he was on , but a few more squares would finish the hill and he went on with it . When the hill was finished he thought for a moment and then began another one . Homesteads , he discovered a part of his mind had been calling those squares for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was people taking land . He was explorers blazing trails and mapping out townships . He was people moving in to cut down trees , get out stumps and boulders , fence and plow and plant and harvest the land won from wilderness . It was a pleasant fantasy and he was just getting it well begun when the fireman on watch called in . " Kinburn , your chow 's down here for you . " " Set it on the workbench , " Kinburn told him . " I 'll be out in a minute . " " Knock off , for God 's sake ! " Skip Lea 's voice came in . " You done more'n a day 's work now . " " In a minute . I got a little patch I want to finish . " He resented the interruption to his land clearing . lie wished he knew more about that , how you drained a swamp and built a log house and a rail fence . He was not tired any more . He did not have to experiment to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round without cramps . He felt the pain in his knees and elbows , but it did not hurt him . It was like chopping the tree that last summer at home . Somewhere along the way , he half-remembered and half-experienced , Flangefaee was calling , had called in . " Knock off , Kinburn . " I ai n't finished . " Come out , now ! That 's an order ! " Go to hell .. He did not break for a moment the rhythm of his hammer . The land clearing began to sink below the surface of his mind again , although it went right on and from time to time would break through . Memories of his hospital life began to play across the surface of his mind like movies on a screen . They were all whiteness , white surgical gowns , starched and rustling nurses , white tile and porcelain dressing rooms , white-enameled diet kitchens , white trash buckets with white lids and a white trash of gauze inside them . The corpsmen put in long hours but they did not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even have the idea of work . They could not imagine it . They were soft and fat and white like slugs and they thought that made them better than other people . What they did in the world was to mix themselves into and measure themselves against the pain and weakness and death of other men . Pain . weakness , and death were all of a whiteness . Reed Kinburn had said goodbye to all that . Health , strength , and work were all of a blackness . He knew himself black and proud and a man . Almost with regret he saw that he was finishing . He squeezed out head first and stood up there , swaying slightly . The popeyed fireman named Dallas had the watch . He came hesitantly toward Kinburn . " Flangeface is waiting up , " he said . " I 'll go tell him . " Kinburn nodded . He did not have to wait for Flangeface Hogan . A reaction was trying to flood him . He went slowly up the ladder holding to the thought that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was black and proud and weary almost to death . The ship was asleep . He was alone in the brightly lighted washroom . It was large and square and all white enamel paint and white tile deck with mirrors along one side above the white vitreous lavatories . On the other side the showers sprayed right out from the bulkhead , with no partitions or curtains to make a shadow from the white glare . Standing naked in the middle of the room a story by Richard McKenna 71 Kinburn began feeling himself to be a shadow without anything to cast it . He was absolutely black . Under his foreskin he was black . The skin was off his knees and elbows and the raw flesh there was more black than red . He felt almost reluctant and curiously uncertain about how to begin cleaning himself . A seaman , the quarter-deck messenger , came in and whistled . " Sure glad I ai n't a snipe , " he said . " Most of you deck apes ai n't man enough to be a snipe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent black water across the white tile . The soap lathered black on his arms and chest and when he rinsed it off ' he was black as ever . The tide of reaction was flooding him . He lathered and scrubbed fiercely , until his cake of soap was worn thin , and his skin was still dark gray . Six times he lathered and scrubbed his left forearm , scraping with his fingernails until he drew blood , and his forearm remained dark gray . The reaction became very strong and bad . His cake of soap was gone and he did not know how he could get another one . He began cursing softly to himself , almost in a whimper . Flangeface Hogan came into the washroom . He was smudged and streaked with soot from having been inside the furnace . He bulked in the doorway and his massive face was as expressionless as the face on a boiler front . Kinburn met his eyes . " Cleanest corrugation I ever saw in my life , " Flangeface rumbled . " Loan me a bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinburn said . Flangeface whirled and went out , moving fast . Very shortly he was back with a bucket and a new red bar of Lifebuoy soap . He filled the bucket and bubbled steam through the water to heat it and set it in one of the lavatories . All the while he talked . . " Shower 's no good for soot . You got to have a bucket . Bucket and soap and loofah sponge . Here , I 'll show you . Turn around . I 'll scrub your back . " The loofah sponge grated pleasantly across Kin-burn 's shoulders . Loofah sponges were some kind of dried vegetable skeleton used to filter grease out of the feed water in the hot well down below . Water made them swell up . While he scrubbed Flangeface kept talking in his grating rumble . " Cleaning firesides ... way to try out a new fireman , see how much he can take . . . you was cleaning the thousand-hour furnace , only you did n't know it . " Whenever a boiler had a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the furnaces were lit off when the ship was under way but only the center furnace was used in port . When the middle furnace had a thousand hours the wing furnaces might have only two or three hundred hours . The center furnace was always by far the worst to clean . " You done three men 's work today ... never seen a new man make it past five o'clock before , " Flangeface rumbled on . From the start I figured you was going tu . You was outworking both them other dunnigans punching tubes and everybody down there knew it except you . " So Flangeface checked Kinburn 's reaction and turned it back to pride . It was more than words or any expression in his face or voice . It was a strong , warm feeling that emanated from him without mediation . Kinburn looked at his back in the mirror and it was still a dingy gray . " The rest has just got to wear off , " Flangeface said . He handed Kinburn the loofah sponge . Use the same water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They ai n't wore out , just because they 're black . The blacker the suds , the better they work . " Kinburn scrubbed himself . Flangeface stood there , talked out but radiating warmth and approval Eke a boiler front . Now and then he found a few more words . " Your cot 's set up on No. 3 hatch . Sleep as late as you want in the morning . I 'll tell the sheriff ... Take tomorrow off . Get them knees fixed up in the sick bay ... " Go ashore soon as you feel like it . Mama Lottie will know the beer is on me as soon as she sees your eyes . " When he knew fur sure that Kinburn was all right , Flangeface said good night and went out . Kinburn finished scrubbing . He was not white . He had midnight rings around his eyes , knees , and elbows because he could not scrub right up into them . But he felt clean and he liked the clean , carbolic smell of himself . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform to soak in the bucket of strong black suds . Stretched out on his cot , he felt the pleasure of rest to the very center of his bones . He thought it was the most voluptuous feeling he had ever experienced . No. 3 hatch was beneath the forward overhang of the prom deck , which the sailors called the front porch , and it was the most sheltered sleeping place on the main deck . Hearing the reef , he drifted toward sleep and discovered that the underneath of his mind was still scraping carbon in the corrugation . Lazily he sought through his feelings for the familiar bitterness that usually attended upon his sleep . It was not there . THE PLAYER PIANO by Randall Jarrell I ate pancakes one night in a Pancake House Run by a lady my age . She was gay . When I told her that I came from Pasadena She laughed and said , " I lived in Pasadena When Fatty Arbuckle drove the El Molina bus . " I felt that I had met someone from home . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , something that we had in common Like  --  like  --  the false armistice . Piano rolls . She told me her house was the first Pancake House East of the Mississippi , and I showed her A picture of my grandson . Going home  --  Home to the hotel  --  I began to hum , " Smile a while , I bid you sad adieu , When the clouds roll back I 'll come to you . " Let 's brush our hair before we go to bed , I say to the old friend who lives in my mirror . I remember how I 'd brush my mother 's hair Before she bobbed it . How long has it been Since I hit my funnybone ? had a scab on my knee ? Here are Mother and Father in a photograph , Father 's holding me . . .. They both look so young . I 'm so much older than they are . Look at them , Two babies with their baby . I do n't blame you . You were n't old enough to know any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down by you both , And sign our true armistice : you were n't to blame . I shut my eyes and there 's our living roam . The piano 's playing something by Chopin , And Mother and Father and their little girl Listen . Look , the keys go down by themselves ! I go over , hold my hands out , play I play  --  If only , somehow , I had learned to live ! The three of us sit watching , as my waltz Plays itself out a half-inch from my fingers . ?
