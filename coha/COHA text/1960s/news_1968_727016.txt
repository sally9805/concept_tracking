txt The Association of American Railroads ordered an embargo yesterday on freight-car load ings destined for the Port of New York , as a result of a strike by longshoremen that has paralyzed dry-cargo shipping in the port for nine days . The embargo was one of several moves taken to cope with developments from the International Longshoremen 's Association 's protest strike against the New York-New Jersey Waterfront Commission 's plans to reopen the longshore register . The agency plans on April 9 to add 750 workers to the register . The new registrants will he eligible only for work at Newark and Elizabeth , N. J .. piers . Some steamship lines were // diverting their ships to South , Atlantic ports for the unloading , of perishable cargoes . More ! than a score of small corm ; panics involved in shipping ' operations confirmed that they were laying off workers . Hundreds of importers re- ' ported problems that promised ' " fearsome " financial losses to already shaky ventures . H. Gordon Randall , manager , of port traffic for the railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ! notified to stop the loading of cars with export freight consigned to New York , where 105 freighters were idle because of the strike . However , military shipments arriving from or bound overseas were , exempt from the embargo . Longshoremen were working five ships with military cargo ! at the Military Ocean Terminals in Bayonne , N. J. , yesterday . Mr. Randall said 1,455 car-1 loads of export freight were on hand in the port and that shipments en route would continue arriving for eight days more , but at a rate progressively lower than the normal 300 carloads a day . In a related move , Ralph C. Gross , president of the Commerce-and Industry Association of New York , sent a telegram to Secretary of Commerce Cyrus R. Smith asking for Federal action that would avoid the loss of export contracts because of the strike . Many export companies , Mr. Gross noted , are " vitally concerned " over expiring foreign import licenses and letters of credit . He asked the Secretary ' to act through American embassies , particularly in South ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To avoid further loss and hardship for exporters , " he said , " we urge you appeal promptly to foreign governments to grant import license ' extensions for the duration of strike and additional 15 days for resumption of normal outbound traffic . " The dispute between the union and Waterfront Commission involves a union position that it has enough men to work the Jersey piers . There are now 21,384 men on the registry . Although the new men the Waterfront Commission wants to put on the longshore register would enjoy no seniority and could only obtain work after job opportunities had been passed up by longshoremen from other sections of the port , the 1 . L.A .. has vigorously opposed the move . The employer group , the New York Shipping Association , which has a contract calling for an annual guaranteed wage for longshoremen , also opposes the agency 's plan on the ground it could upset collective bargaining agreements . Alexander P. Chopin , chairman of the New York Shipping Association , put the loss from the strike to the industry alone at more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained more than 500,000 tons of cargo to be discharged , of which more than 8,000 tons were of perishable products . A shipping association committee had met with officials of the Waterfront Commission late Monday night in an attempt to call in mediators to settle the dispute . Following the meeting , at which the request was rejected , a spokesman for the agency explained the commission 's move . " This is not a matter of collective bargaining . This is a matter of government officials , whose duty is to the public , who have statutory responsibility to open the register , and whose actions are reviewable by the courts , - not by media ; tion . " Yesterday afternoon Burton ' Turkus , the shipping port arbitrator , conducted a 41A-hour hearing on the strike . When the meeting , which was de -- 'scribed as " stormy , " ended shortly after 6:30 , Mr. Turkus , announced that he would resume the hearing at 4:00 P.M. today . Before the meeting , Mr. Chopin said he wanted to make it " unmistakably clear that we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ac-. tion the I.L.A. has taken in ' . trying to force the commission to rescind its order .
