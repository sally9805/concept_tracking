Ex-King Saud so mismanaged Saudi Arabia 's affairs that when his own family forced him into exile in 1964 , it gladly agreed to pay him a pension of $600,000 a year just to be free of him . <P> Despite his wealth , which would be welcome almost anywhere in the world , it came as a surprise when Saud 's old foe , Gamal Abdel Nasser , last December allowed Saud to take up residence in Egypt . Last week Saud , 65 , showed that he is not an ungrateful guest . Flying to Yemen , he gave his wholehearted blessing to the republican regime of Nasser 's puppet , General Abdullah Sallal , and declared that he himself is " the only legitimate monarch of Saudi Arabia . " Back in Cairo , he went on the air to announce that he had " decided to return home at whatever cost " to reclaim his throne from his brother - and Nasser 's current enemy - King Feisal . <P> Pleasure &; Pain . Despite the $250 million that he is estimated to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat curtailed . He suffers from ulcers and cirrhosis of the liver , has traveled from Beirut to Boston looking for doctors to repair his chronically overworked digestive tract . <P> Once called " the harem king " by Nasser , Saud now has an entourage of only 40 members , including the four wives permitted by Moslem law and four concubines . He brought 32 limousines and sports cars with him when he moved from Athens to Egypt . As the price of his entry into Egypt Saud reportedly had to pay $5,000,000 into Nasser 's treasury . For months , he and his retinue occupied two floors in Shepheard 's Hotel , where he nightly entertained guests in the " Scheherazade Salon . " Now Nasser has provided him with a suburban Cairo palace that once belonged to King Feisal and has been taken over by the government . <P> Even though Saud had refrained from any political statements until last week , Feisal cut off Saud 's princely pension as soon as he arrived in Egypt and embraced Nasser . His three-day triumphal " state visit " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in 1962 pledged Saudi Arabian support for the royalist guerrillas , who now hold two-thirds of the country and are waging a bloody civil war against Sallal 's republicans and the 40,000 Egyptian troops allied with them . Now Saud ridicules the royalists as " conceited fellows , " denounces Feisal , who gives them supplies , as " an imperialist . " Before departing from Yemen , he grandly donated $1,000,000 to Sallal for reconstruction of the wartorn capital of San'a . <P> Grim Example . Saud 's chances of ever regaining power in Saudi Arabia are almost nil . The country has made far more social and economic gains under the austere Feisal than it ever did under Saud . Even those Bedouin chieftains whose loyalty Saud won in the old days with bags of gold are not clamoring to have him back . The grim example of the 17 Yemeni terrorists whom Feisal recently had beheaded in Riyadh should also discourage dissident tribesmen from siding with Saud .                    @
