Should animals observe Lent ? In his Lenten pastoral letter , Britain 's William Cardinal Godfrey , Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster , suggested that 1 ) Catholic families observe Ember Friday ( Feb. 24 ) by fasting and donating the money thus saved to relief of the " hungry and starving , " and 2 ) pets be fed with less expensive foods . " A plump and pampered poodle might run all the more gaily after a reduced diet , simpler fare , and perhaps after having been denied a visit to the hair stylist . If this suggestion seems odd , turn to the third chapter of the Book of Jonas , in which we read that , at the thought of impending disaster , the Ninevites ' King raised a cry for a fast for man and beast . " <P> A different kind of cry was raised in England at the archbishop 's words . Senior Scientist Rufus Bowden of the Animal Health Trust : " An animal does n't understand what fasting is . It might be worried if its food did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . " Comedian Charlie Chester : " It 's all bilge . If I want to help the hungry , I wo n't drag my poodle Sasha into it . " N. J. Lambert of the Canine Defense League : " The cardinal 's idea seems fatuous . It would be punishing the animals . They would not know what it was for . " Then he threw in a bit of startling theology : " We have some animals who behave in a more Christian way than some Christians . "
