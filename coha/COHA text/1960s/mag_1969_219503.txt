Shuddering at the prospect of deadlocked elections being settled by Congress , Thomas Jefferson called the Electoral College system " the most dangerous blot on our Constitution . " No fewer than 500 attempts have been made to reform the procedure , but none has ever got past Congress . Now it appears that electoral reform is an idea whose time has come . <P> Last week , by a surprisingly lopsided bipartisan vote of 28-6 , the House Judiciary Committee approved a constitutional amendment to scrap the Electoral College . Citizens would vote directly for President , as they do for all other elected officials . If no candidate got at least 40% of the vote , a run-off between the top two aspirants would follow . Such a system would not have changed the outcome last year , but it would have eliminated the twin risks inherent in the present constitutional practice : that a candidate running second in the popular vote would get a majority of electoral votes , and that the failure of any candidate to get a majority would throw the selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred in the 19th century . <P> George Wallace hoped that his presence in the 1968 elections would deny any candidate an Electoral College majority , leaving him with the decisive votes to name the next President . Before Election Day , according to the Gallup poll , 66% of the nation favored direct presidential elections . By December , the figure had jumped to 81% . <P> The State Factor . Congress ' sudden sympathy for reform reflects that growing public desire for a change . What shape a proposed amendment will finally take is not yet clear , however . Besides the House Judiciary Committee 's plan for a direct election , there are also schemes to retain electoral votes in some form . One such plan would divide each state 's electoral votes among the candidates according to the popular-vote breakdown . Another would elect members of the Electoral College by local districts . <P> Witnesses before the committee argued that both the district and proportional approaches would perpetuate some of the worst abuses of the present system . Nonetheless , the direct method faces formidable obstacles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural and traditional Congressmen in the House and Senate-and the amendment needs a two-thirds majority for passage in each body . <P> Any amendment would also need the approval of 38 state legislatures , and it is impossible to predict how they would react . Generally , there has been resistance within smaller states to major electoral change . By abandoning the present method of giving a candidate all of a state 's votes , no matter how small his popular plurality , reformers also reduce the bargaining power and importance of state party organizations . The Senate , traditionally more sensitive to states ' rights than the House , is likely to provide a tougher battleground than the lower chamber .
