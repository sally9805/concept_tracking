Like their ancient forebears at the siege of Troy , Greek soldiers slipped quietly aboard troop ships in a Cyprus harbor last week and sailed for home . <P> They left behind nothing resembling a Trojan horse as a symbol of Greek cunning , but only anger and disappointment . After relying for seven years on the troops to ensure its dominance over the Turks , the Greek Cypriot majority was furious at Greece 's military rulers for buckling under to Turkish demands for a withdrawal of the great bulk of them . Said Synagromos , a leading Greek Cypriot newspaper : " The battle for Cyprus has unfortunately been lost for good . " <P> Turkish Advantages . In Nicosia , stunned Greek diplomats conceded that the age-old Greek aim of enosis ( union ) between mainland and island was dead . <P> They also conceded that the settlement had enhanced Turkish prestige and plummeted Greek influence on the island to an alltime low . Said a ranking Greek diplomat in Nicosia : " Pax Hellenica has ended . It is being replaced by Pax Ottomana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Envoy Cyrus Vance , last week 's withdrawals will be followed by others , until Greece 's 9,000-man force on the island is reduced to only 950 , the number Greece is legally entitled to station there under Cyprus ' independence agreements . In reciprocation , the Turks called off their invasion preparations against Cyprus and Greece and agreed to withdraw the 1,500 or so troops that they infiltrated into Cyprus in excess of their 650-man legal allotment . Shrewdly calculating that the Greek rulers lacked the support both at home and abroad to stand up to a crisis , Turkish Premier Siileyman Demirel thus managed to break Greece 's military hold on the island . He placed it , at least temporarily , at the mercy of the Turks , whose airbases are only four minutes ' flying time from Nicosia . <P> Wary of Yogurt . Through some deft last-minute maneuvers , Archbishop Makarios , the island 's bearded President , managed to sidestep some of the immediate consequences of the settlement . Under the agreement , the Turks and Greeks called on him to disband his 11,000-man Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4,000 U.N . peace-keeping troops stationed on Cyprus . Fearing an encroachment on Cyprus ' sovereignty , Makarios replied that he wanted the Security Council to endorse the truce package before he finally acted . That could mean never-since France and the Soviet Union oppose peace-keeping operations on general principles . <P> Makarios still faces a radically changed situation . He is now free to stop paying lip service to enosis and get on with the course he seems to prefer anyhow : making Cyprus a strong independent country . He will have to be more considerate of the 120,000 Turkish Cypriots , who are outnumbered by the 480,000 Cypriots of Greek origin , unless he wants to face renewed invasion threats from Turkey without his Greek army support and most of the Greek officers who commanded his guard . There was , in fact , already talk in Nicosia of a new reconciliation program to allay Turk Cypriot fears .
