txt Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower says he will withhold support from any candidate who advocates a pull-out from Vietnam , and he accuses militant peace groups of " rebellion " and near-treason . In a copyrighted article in the April issue of Reader 's Digest , available yesterday , General Eisenhower accused war dissenters of giving " aid and comfort to the enemy " and said their " raucous " behavior was probably " making , honorable negotiations impossible . " He italicized this state-ment : ! ' l will not personally support ilany peace-at-any-price candidate who advocates capitulation and the abandonment of South Vietnam . " Scores ' Young Senator ' He did not mention any candidate by name . But he wrote scornfully of " a young U. S. Senator who was quoted as saying that if we are fighting in Vietnam to protect &ourselves,; then we must concede that we are being selfishly ! immoral . " " To me this seems the height ! of tortured reasoning , if not worse , " General Eisenhower said . " Certainly , we are fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination of Cornmun ism . " In my opinion it would be ( grossly immoral not to resist a tyranny whose openly avowed ' purpose is to subjugate the earth ? and particularly the United States of America . " The Senator was indulging in sophistry , and 1 suspect his purpose was political rather , than patriotic . " General Eisenhower also ridi ' culed the " enclave theory " advanced by his former colleague , Lieut . Gen. James M. Gavin , retired , who proposed that American forces pull into defensive perimeters along the populated coast of Vietnam instead of fighting in the forests and mountains . Without naming General Gavin , General Eisenhower said that those who advance the enclave theory " want our troops to sit down in ' defensive enclaves ' and drop all offensive action  --  presumably until a tough enemy gets tired of looking at our military might and goes quietly home . " Reader 's Digest showed the article to President Johnson in advance of publication . The President praised the article as " a magnificent summons to conscience and common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president of the magazine , President Johnson said of General Eisenhower : " Few men can speak of war and peace with greater authority or wisdom . None can claim any larger love for freedom and country . " If these truths be the standards of judgment , I am deeply hopeful that your readers and all Americans will be moved to see their duty and accept their responsibility ? closing ranks on the home front so that peace might come more quickly to the ranks of all men . " Mr. Devine said last night that he had talked with General Eisenhower in Palm Desert , Calif. , less than a month ago and that the general had suggested no changes in the article . Again without mentioning General Gavin , General Eisenhower repeated his criticism of the enclave theory , adding his impression that American troops would be " sitting ducks for mortar fire " if they retired to perimeters , Mr. Devine said . In his article , General Eisenhower called for an end to " divisive " political debate on Vietnam . He warned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was encouraging Hanoi to believe that public opinion in the United States would eventually compel withdrawal . In all his life , General Eisenhower said , he has never seen anything more depressing that the " present spectacle . " , " What has become of our courage ? " he demanded . " What has become of our loyalty to others ? What has become of a noble concept called patriotism , which in former times of crisis has carried us through to victory and peace ? " General Eisenhower said he was not objecting to " honorable dissent . " Some people , he conceded , are sincere in believing " we have no business being in Vietnam . " These people are " terribly and dangerously wrong " but they have a right to be heard , he added . He noted a " ludicrous and dangerous aspect of this bitter quarrel " : the " large number of public men who regard themselves as military experts . " " One large defeatist group proclaims loudly and positively that ' we can never win the Vietnam war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the best military judgment and to clear evidence , that our air strikes ' do no good ' and we must cease all bombing of targets in the I North .
