Scene : The garden of a Village bar in early afternoon . Summer . Two people are seated at a table in the garden , a very old , carved up table . The girl wears her hair everywhere . Covering her body are once-white , paint-stained coveralls . A Medieval amulet hangs about her neck on a smokey chain . The boy wears a long plaid scarf around his throat . It has never been to the dry-cleaner . His dark T-shirt is bleach stained . The too-new jeans is the only false note about him . Both wear decomposed sneakers . SARAH I get lost in knotholes . SEYMOUR My eye follows flower lines . SARAH I used to do that . Like on the wallpaper of my Mother 's and Father 's bedroom when I was little and allowed in bed on Sunday mornings . SEYMOUR Like that . Must be why it 's so satisfying . Reading the funnies ? SARAH No , the Times Book Review . SEYMOUR Why , that 's what we read . SARAH No , Seymour ! SEYMOUR Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SEYMOUR Our wallpaper had roses grow 's copiously around lattices . I traced every flower in the room lying on my back nestled against Momma 's belly . Sometimes I 'd follow the leaf outlines too ,  --  especailly when father was n't home . p. 3 SARAH My sister and I peeled the paper off the walls while Mother read and father took notes . That 's when I discovered knotholes . After peeling the paper down through all the layers of families who lived there before us , I found wood . I saw wood with a fixed knot . . . a knot that had a life of its own . Now , only whirling wood lines trap my eyes . I 'm compelled to the center and ca n't find my way out again . My sister gave it up when she reached puberty . But I still find it realaxing . SEYMOUR I know what you mean . Dark out-lines around bright flower shapes do it to me . I start eye-tracing the flower , a flower anywhere , any flower but a growing flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done the whole wall . If it happens to be a lady in a flowered dress the action is more complicated . . . and tiring . SARAH Because you have to trace all around her body . . . SEYMOUR ( his eye fastens onto label of wine bottle ) Exactly . . . SARAH . . . the moon-side , hidden from your actual view , but very present in your imagination . SEYMOUR And very pleasant . SARAH ( As her eyes become fixed on a knot in the wood of the table ) On the whole it 's a subtle release from tension . p. 4 SEYMOUR Work tension . SARAH Worry tension . SEYMOUR World tension . SARAH I agree . SEYMOUR But only if it happens all by itself , I mean  --  spontaneously  --  you ca n't strive for it , you 'll destroy the " suchness " of it  --  the " Gestalt " of it . SARAH I know so well what you mean . SEYMOUR ( staring entranced he reaches for the bottle ) May I pour you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table ) What was that ? I 'm sorry . . . I 'm with you , Seymour . . . I just was n't listening to you . SEYMOUR Wine , Sarah , would you like more wine ? SARAH ( continuing to stare at the knot in the table wood ) Wine . . . grape . . . water . . . red . . . soft . . . sip . . . SEYMOUR ( He pours wine , lost in his eye-tracing of the flower patterns on the label . The wine overflows onto the table ) I wonder if these are the flowers of the grape before . . . opps. . . sorry . . . Oh . . . . sorry . . . . sorry . . . p. 5 SARAH ( continuing to look at her table ) SATORI. . . satori. . . nothing special . . . a drop of wine . . . nothing special . . . Seymour , do you know what 's happened to me ? ? ? ( The wine flows over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his scarf and attempting to mop up the wine ) I 'm terribly sorry , Sarah . I hope it did n't stain your trousers . SARAH ( lifting her arm in a soft gesture ) Do n't move  - -  -  please , do n't move . . . ( She continues to stare at the top of the table . ) See how it swirls in the worn place here ? Look at the double image it gives to the knot in the wood . . . around , and around . . . and around . . . enlightened via wine . . . enlightenment is mine . . . Seymour , I am thine . SEYMOUR ( nervously looking at the table top ) Look how the bubles rise to the surface and break . . . break , break into flower patterns . SARAH Where ? SEYMOUR There . . . there . . . right there in the groove of those carved initials . Right where the top of the " T " meets the " S " and descends into the " O " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 6 SARAH ( with quiet rapture ) Seymour , I see them . . . I see . . . I feel . . . your flowers . . . SEYMOUR ( slowly taking her hand ) My flower . . . SARAH The round lines and the rising shapes have united . . . but look the wine is drying . . . do n't let it stop . . . do n't break the chain . . . Seymour , do something . . . SEYMOUR ( heroically , pouring more wine onto the table ) I 'll make it last for you , baby . . . ( THEY BOTH STARE FIXEDLY AT THE TABLE AS THE LIGHTS FADE OUT ) CURTAIN
