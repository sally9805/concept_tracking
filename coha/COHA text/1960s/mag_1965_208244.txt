There is only one thing worse than Argentina 's usual kind of public service . And that is no public service at all . Yet to all intents and purposes , that has been the country 's unhappy lot for the past three months . <P> The paralysis set in during November , when President Arturo Illia attempted to call a halt to inflation-nurturing pay raises for 900,000 public employees . The unions , which were demanding another round of 25% to 45% pay hikes , responded with an unending succession of strikes and slowdowns . At one point this month , 300,000 telephone , railroad , postoffice , airport , merchant-fleet and port employees were on strike ; even casino croupiers and street cleaners left their jobs . <P> Argentina 's long-suffering citizens are getting fed up with it all . Last week a riot erupted at Buenos Aires ' Ezeiza airport when ground crews refused to unload baggage-including the wheelchair of a 14-year-old paraplegic boy . In another part of town , an enraged 65-year-old pension applicant whipped out a pistol and killed a go-slow clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he return in a few days ; it was the fifth time he had been put off , and each refusal meant a 70-mile round trip from his home in the countryside . <P> President Illia 's solution to the mess was to give in . Last week , with an eye to the March congressional elections , he granted a 28% pay boost to telephone workers , another 25% raise to railwaymen-all of which should add another few percentage points to Argentina 's disastrous inflation , already up 30% in the past year .
