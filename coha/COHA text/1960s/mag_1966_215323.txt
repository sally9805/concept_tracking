THE PRESIDENCY <P> In the course of his jocular press conference , President Johnson warned newsmen not to waste their money betting on a Republican sweep at the polls this fall . " The elections , " he crowed , " are going to be fine . " <P> Pooh-poohing pundits ' predictions that the Democrats would lose dozens of House seats in November , the President allowed : " There are these people who pick these figures out of the air . " He confided that " someone the other night " even talked of a G.O.P. gain of 74 to 80 House seats . " It was amusing . I wondered how much he knew about any House seat . " <P> Johnson had kindlier words for the so far unremarkable legislative record of the 89th Congress this year . " Congressmen on both sides have done a good job , " he said . " We will probably have 15 or 20 measures signed before Easter , and that is something unusual . " Asked if he would campaign himself for individual Congressmen , Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give my advice if it was solicited in the right way , under the proper auspices , with appropriate sponsorship . " Which almost certainly can be translated to mean that-Viet Nam willing-Johnson will be hustling around the hustings all he can . <P> Down , Down . Though he spoke off the cuff throughout most of the 40-minute conference , Johnson did just happen to have a statistics-studded memo on his desk when a reporter asked him whether he planned to ask <P> Congress to raise taxes . With obvious satisfaction , he quickly ticked off a series of fresh figures indicating that inflationary pressures may be easing off a bit . Retail sales were down , housing starts were down , new orders for durable goods were down , and the money supply has declined . Johnson also pointed out that medicare deductions would take $6 billion out of the economy , that the new increase in upper-income tax withholding would take some $4 billion this year , that costs of the war in Viet Nam were running under estimates so far in 1966 . <P> Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't want to act prematurely , " said Johnson . " We do n't want to put on the brakes too fast , but it is something that requires study every day and we are doing that . " Nevertheless , the President left the door open for a hike by reminding reporters that " Congress is adding some expenditures that we did not ask for ; they may add some more . " <P> Reply to De Gaulle . Next day Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler told a National Press Club audience that no taxhike decision was likely until late April , when first-quarter economic statistics are firm and " we will have a far clearer picture of what the revenue side of the budget-as well as the net budgetary figure itself-finally looks like . " <P> The President declined to answer press conference questions about Charles de Gaulle 's plan to pull France out of NATO . But the next day , in a speech before the Foreign Affairs Institute , Johnson offered a lofty but not unfriendly reply to De Gaulle , saying that the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies to preserve and to strengthen the deterrent strength of NATO , " but that " a place of respect and responsibility will await any ally who decides to return .
