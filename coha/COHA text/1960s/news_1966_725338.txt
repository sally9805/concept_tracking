txt American labor now is publicly bridling under the Johnson administration 's voluntary wage reins . Discontent has simmered long underneath . Now it has flared into the open . Union spokesmen are bitterly raking the Council of Economic Advisers for clinging to its 3.2 percent guideline for wage hikes deemed " noninflationary . " Labor thinks the ceiling is unrealistic . George Meany , AFL-CIO president , has assailed the restraints for not being matched by tighter curbs on prices and profits . President Johnson still hopes to persuade labor to hew to his restraints . But the odds are heavy against him . And any serious labor disregard of his policy could sink it . Employers are bristling under a government guideline of another stripe . The National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) has just ruled that employers must hand the names and addresses of their employees over to union organizers . Riled employers intend to challenge the order in federal court as " an invasion of employer 's property rights . " The board handed down two rulings at once . It first held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting unions equal time and opportunity to answer . In the past , employers had to grant rebuttal time . In almost the same breath the NLRB said employers instead must make it possible for unions to reach all employees in their homes . That 's what irks employers and is about to drive them to court . The federal minimum wage is likely to go up this year . But instead of zooming  --  as labor wishes  --  it will only creep . Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz wants the minimum wage notched higher than the present $1.25 an hour . He says it would help the Great Society 's antipoverty war . Labor wants a hefty $2 minimum , but is spreading the word on Capitol Hill that it would settle for $1.75 ? for now . It wo n't get even that much . With administration prodding , Congress may agree to $1.60 outright . But it 's more likely that the hourly rate in the wage-hour act will go up only to $1.40 now , then inch up another 20 cents a year later . Trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Mine Workers ' plans to demand pay raises this year . Mining companies warn that the UMW could price them out of the market . The industry is prosperous . Coal production is on the upswing . But , industry spokesmen say , the key to industry hardihood is the increasing use of coal by electric utilities . If coal prices go up  --  and mine operators say they must if labor costs rise  --  utilities may slack off in their coal consumption and turn to the atom instead . The UMW will disregard these warnings . Already it is roughing out demands . Mine workers now get $26.25 a day . They will insist on at least a Sl-a-day raise , plus more job security , vacation time , paid holidays , and other fringe demands . American unions doing business in Canada intend to help their Canadian brothers get raises . They have a double purpose in this . First , the unions contend that lower pay in Canada might lure American manufacturers away to Canada , taking American jobs with them . Second , Canada has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . American labor wants to help see that lifted . How and why ? ? ? Another report on automation 's threat to labor is out . It took a year to finish and it has landed in labor circles with a disappointing thud . Labor had hoped it would plow new ground on the whole subject of automation 's impact on jobs . But the report , by the administration 's 14-man National Commission on Technology , Automation , and Economic Progress , dug up little that had n't been said before . The commission does n't view automation as quite the job-eating ogre many think it is . But it still found " no ground for complacency , " since society has n't yet met the challenge of technical progress " with complete success . " The corn mission 's recommendations were to have been a basis for a presidential message on measures to cope with automation 's problems . It may still be eventually . But it is n't likely that such a controversial issue will be brought up this year . reproduced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission .
