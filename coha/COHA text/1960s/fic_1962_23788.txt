THE OTHER ROOM A Story by JAMES THURBER H E bar of the Hotel Continental in Paris is large and comfortable , and never too crowded , especially in October , when the American invaders are beginning to thin out , and it is presided over by an efficient . and amiable waiter named Jacques . He had just brought drinks for my wife and me and an English painter we know . You can lean back in the Continental bar , drinking for pleasure , slowly , in the European manner , without the urge to see how soon you can reach the point when you no longer know you 're drinking , in the American manner . An American woman , at a nearby table , was explaining to a friend the reason for her dermatitis , insisting that it had been caused by aluminum pots and pans . " My allergist says I have an emotional conflict or something , " she said . " Doctors always say there 's something the matter with you , but it 's almost always something you use around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm terribly high-strung , I know that , " she said , " but it is n't that , If it was I 'd know it . " The Continental bar , like any other place where Americans gather , is used largely for the exchange of symptoms , complaints about French coffee , and the enumeration of hotels and restaurants on the Continent and in England which one should , at all costs , avoid . We were waiting for three persons to join us , all of them compatriots of ours  --  one a twentytwo-year-old American girl , the daughter of friends of ours back home , and the other two a man and his wife , friends of friends of ours , neither of whom we had ever met . We had got , a few days before , the usual note from somebody in New York , saying that she had instructed the Barretts to look us up at the hotel , and , in the unfailing routine of such matters , they had telephoned and we had made a date for drinks , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could get rid of them . The painter was telling us about his own favorite hotel , a mythical composite one , invented in the imagination of a friend of his , and called the Hotel **31;1819;TOOLONG , when a nine-year-old girl , unmistakably American , and loose momentarily from her parents , materialized at my elbow . She had dashed into the bar to look at the television set near the door leading into the dining-room . " It 's in French , " she said . " It ought to be in English . Why is n't it in English ? " I explained to her that it was not in English in the same way that television in America was not in French , but she was unconvinced and clearly unimpressed by my knowledge of such things . The small interruption annoyed me , because I had been on the point of describing my own favorite French hostelry , the " **38;1852;TOOLONG . " " Tell me a story , " commanded the little girl . " My name is Eunice . " She squirmed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever hear of the Teapot Dome scandal ? " I asked . " I do n't think I like it , " she said . " What is it ? " " You surely know what a teapot dome is , " said . She got up , frowning , stood on her toes a moment , and sat down again . " Yes , " she said . I began to drink faster , in the American manner , and said , " A scandal is when a teapot dome does n't obey its parents , but runs in and out of bars , and wo n't eat anything for bekkus except lint and buttons . Weil , this particular teapot dome was ? " A large woman , obviously the child 's moi her , loomed up suddenly out of nowhere , like a pirate ship . " We never say bekkus to Eunice , " she said . " She loathes it . " " I loathe it , " said Eunice . " Sorry , " I said . " it has been so long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Now , now , " said my wife . " You were going to be nice this evening . " " For a change , " our painter friend asked , " or just as a noble experiment ? " " Well ! " said the ignored mother , and she dragged the little girl away . " What happened to the Teapot Dome scandal ? You ca n't just leave it hanging there , you know , " said the painter , but I left it hanging there , for my wife said , " Here 's Linda now . " I IND A GRAY , fresh-looking and pretty , with the eyes of au angel , said she was sorry she was late , but I reminded her that American girls were always late , and she was introduced to our English friend . " Mr. Middleton would like to paint you , I airs sure . " I said . " I am a gifted man , " Middleton said , " but not that gifted . The portrait of this lady would require something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to drink , and she asked for a Coca-Cola . " I have had an adventure , " she said . " Not a very pleasant one . " " I hope it is n't too racy , " I said . " My wife has led a cloistered life , and believes that the storks find babies under cabbage leaves . " " Oh , it was n't like that , " Linda said , with a slight frisson . ' ' I had just turned away from the window of a shop on the Rue de Rivoli when this American  --  he must . have been about sixty  --  spoke to me . It 's terrible , or sad , or something , but it 's usually an American , a middle-aged American , who speaks to us girls on the street , not a Frenchman or any other foreigner . " " What did he say ? " my wife wanted to know . Linda paused a moment . " He said , ' Combien pour knife ht nuii ? ' " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That goes back to the battle of Paris in the first world war . I know all the verses . " " You would , " my wife said . " I used to sing them with the fellows , " I said , " but I never said thesis to the girls . " " I just looked at him , " Linda said , " and told him ' I am an American girl . ' I really put my best Sunday virtue into it . Funny , he seemed to look at me and past me too . It was odd , andgave me the shivers a little . Then he said something I did n't understand and walked away . " " Travel is broadening , but disillusioning , " said Middleton . " I know the type , " I said , " for I make a study of morbid things . He probably had n't made a pass at a woman for twenty years back home . Over here , on summer holiday , they get away from their wives , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was probably just trying to recapture his lost youth . Paris has a strange effect on the middle-aged American male , something like the loss of inhibition that takes place on shipboard . Of course , it happens to the American woman , too , sometimes . I knew a cruise director , once , who told me that he had had affairs with women on ships who would n't have spoken to him on land . " " Human nature , as Montaigne or somebody said years ago , is capable of curious behavior , " Middleton put in . " The dark unfathomed caves of notion , to coin a phrase  --  a rather pretty phrase , if I may say so . " " My God , there he is now ! " said Linda . The man she was looking at had just come into the bar and begun looking around . He was sixty , all right , with a familiar harried look , and the sagging shoulders of a man who has sat for years at a desk . " I hope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Barrett . He headed straight for our table , walking with a slight limp . " In the midst of life we are in worse than death , " Middleton said . " I 'd better go , " Linda said . " I 'd better go . " " He wo n't remember you , " I told her . " Do n't recognize him . " " If he could forget this girl 's eyes , " Middleton said , " he is something less than normal . " I said , " Are you Mr. Barrett ? " before he could say anything , but managed in keep both hands busy , one holding my drink , the other my cigarette . I did n't know what to say , but I had to say something . " You been behaving yourself , Mr. Barrett ? " I asked . " Have to , " he said . " Got the little woman with me , you know . " We managed the introduction James Thurber , author of " The Secret Life of Walter Milo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of stories and sketches , died in November 1961 . " The Other Room " will appear in a new collection , " Credos and Curios , " to be published this fall , with an introduction by Helen Thurber , somehow . Barrett recognized Linda , there was no doubt about that . He was for three seconds a statue in bronze , a frightened statue , a little tired , a little older than the man who had walked into the room . My wife did her best to cover it over with roses . asking where Mrs. Barrett was , and how she was , and how long they were going to stay , and how our mutual friends in New York were , trying to bring some ease to the bronze figure of a trapped , middle-aged , middle-class American man , whose lack of social resource was as evident as wind on a prairie . Jacques appeared , and more drinks were ordered , and the ease that Jacques invariably brings to a table of Americans helped a little to break the tableau and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this time , " Linda said . " Do that twice , " Barrett said , and it seemed to me I had known he was going to say just that . Middleton sat studying us all as if he were about to sketch in a composition , a conversation piece . B A R R E T T sat down stiffly and uneasily on the edge of a chair , the unhappiest man I had seen that summer  --  or any other summer , for that matter . I felt enormously sorry for him . " Were you in the first war , the war the French still call ' La Grande Guerre ' ? " I asked , and he sat back a little and came as close as he could to relaxing , " I was there , Charley , " he said , almost as if to himself . ' ' This is the first time I have seen Paris since those days . I was at Fere-en-Tardenois , and I got shoved around up there . It was pretty rough going . " " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two guys who were there , " and I told him their names , but I do n't think he was listening . " Yeah , sure , yeah , sure , " he said . " The Refines knocked off a lot of us . It was like fighting in a room . They were on all sides of you . I drove out there the other day , hired a car and drove out there . As I got closer to the battlefield , I got scared , I do n't mind saying . I wanted to tell the guy to turn around and drive hack to Paris , but I did n't . We came to this sign that says Fere-enTardenois ? 1 4 km. ' and it seemed like two hours from there . There 's a big American cemetery there now . " He was glad to get the scotch he had ordered , his hand shook when he picked it up . " One of the men I knew was made a sergeant on the held , " I said . " All the sergeants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it alive , but he carried shrapnel with him all his life , and was in and out of hospitals . " " Yeah , sure , " said Barrett . " I got some stuff in me , too . I got a silver plate , I got two silver plates . " He touched his right leg and then the left side of his head . " It seems to me I was always in hospitals , army hospitals , in my twenties . " He gave a troubled sigh . " What I seem to remember most is hospitals . When I get nightmares , even my office turns into a hospital , even now . " There was a softening of the tension in the air , a little , I thought , like candlelight replacing the glare of torches . Nobody said anything for a moment except Linda . " I 'm sorry , " Linda said . " Where is Mrs. Barrett ? " my wife asked , tactfully shifting gears . " I do n't know , " Barrett said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , she 's always ahead of me . " " Perhaps she left a message for you at the desk , " my wife said . " Shall I find out ? " Barrett stood up , saying , " No , no , I 'll go out and ask , " and he went out of the bar . " He 's kind of nice , " said Linda , after a long moment . " He has a nice smile . I wish he had smiled when he spoke to me on the street , but he did n't . " " I think he needs another drink , " I said . Barrett had finished his drink fast , as nervous men do , and so I signaled Jacques . " The same again , all around , " 1 told him . " I do n't know anything about him or his wife , " my wife put in . " All that Ella said in her note was something about ' Please he nice to the Barretts . They have both been through a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter , ' Hastily . ' Everybody is always in such a rush . " You never know what the boys who survived Fere-en-Tardenois are going to say or do , " I said , " or how much they arc going to drink . You 've either been through a battle like that , or you have n't . " " I do n't think he should have driven up there , " Linda said . " I do n't think it was good for him . " " I do , " Middleton said . " Maybe he 'll get it out of his nightmares , now . Maybe his office will turn into an office again in his dreams . " Barrett came back to the table , looking even more tired , and somehow grayer . " Martha is lying down , " he told us . " This trip has pretty well tuckered her out . We should n't have done that Chkeaux tour , I guess . It took a lot out of her . " He did n't sit down . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was nice of you to ask us , " " You 're not going yet , " I told him . " We 've ordered you another drink . " His face brightened a little and , after a slight pause . lie sat down again , this time farther back in his chair . " Tell us sonic more about the war , " I said . " Maybe it will get those hospitals out of your nightmares . " He gave us his slow , gentle smile . " It was n't so much the battle , or even the hospitals , " he began , finally . " At least , that 's what one of the does in the States told me back in the ' twenties . It was something that happened in the battle of Paris , I guess . Anyway , this doc said so . " The new drinks arrived , and he picked up his eagerly . " What was it ? " Linda asked . " Kind of a silly thing , it was , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedar Rapids . I was only twenty-one when I got to France , and I thought it was a million miles from anywhere . You get homesick when you 're that young , and are that far away from home . It 's worse than the battle . You get through the battle , somehow , and you do n't think much about it till later in the hospital , or when you fall asleep . They had given me a lot of stuff to make me sleep , and I 'd never taken dope before . " He drank some more of his whiskey and soda . " I remember Paris clearer than anything , " he said , " but I ca n't remember how I got here . or just when it was . I gut out of the base hospital , because I could n't take it any longer , and I got to Paris . I was AWOL . It 's all pretty hazy . " A FTFR this confession , he sat for a long time without saying anything , and we wa ited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began finally . " I never could pronounce it right . " He was correct about that , but none of us pronounced the words for him . " Then . there was this girl , this French girl . She was n't any older than I was . She spoke English , though , and was I glad for that Well , we sat out in front of the Cafe de la Paix . We drove there in a taxi . She said she thought I did n't look very well , and she said she thought I should have something to drink . And so we had a couple of drinks . Then she told me about herself . She came from some place in southern France , and her father was a drunkard , and used to heat up the family on Saturday nights , so she ran away to Paris , and got some work in a garment factory , but all they gave her was a few francs a week , and she saw all these other girls in fur coats and things , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better , she called it . " This time , there was an even longer silence , but we all waited politely and attentively . " I never told Martha about all this , " he took up again . " But the other day , I took a taxi up to the street where this French girl used to have an apartment . I remembered the street , and even the number , I remembered the number , too . They call it Rue Marcadet , and it 's up there in Montmartre . I did n't get out of the cab . Maybe I should have , but I did n't get out . I just looked at the building , the windows on the second floor . Nobody there would know about her now . Her name was Francoise , but she told me to call her Frances , and so I called her Frances . She would be sixty now . Does n't seem possible , but she would be sixty now . Well , like I said , she was only twenty herself then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guys in uniform , guys of all the allied countries . The picture I ca n't forget was a picture of a young Canadian soldier . She had it framed , and it was sitting on her piano . He was a handsome fella , and he could n't have been more than twenty himself . " He looked at Linda . as if she were too young to hear the rest of the story , but she said , " I 'm much older than any of you were . I 'm twenty-two . " " Well , of course , I never saw this Canadian boy , but he gets into my dreams , too , kinda banged up , with his uniform all bloody . You see , she found out from a buddy of his later that he had been killed in action . This friend of his brought her this note he had written her , the last note he had ever written , I guess . She showed it to me one day in her apartment  --  the first and only time I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what it said , all right , every word of it , though I do n't remember things as well as I used to . " He took some more of his drink and set the glass on the table . " Finish that , " I told him , " and we 'll get another one . " " No , no , " he said , with his little smile , " I never have more than two . Well , she had a bottle of port wine at her place , and we sat there drinking this port wine , too much of it , I guess . After a while , she went out of the room into  --  the other rnom , and left me sitting there with the whole damn war all around me , it seemed like . This good-looking boy on the piano kept staring at me. and looking sad , and awful young  --  like that part from ' St. James Infirmary . ' " " ' So young , so cold , so fair , ' " Linda murmured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He picked up his glass again , and leaned back in his chair , and sighed deeply . " Well , I sat there , thinking of too many things , thinking of everything , the way it all floods back on you , you know . " We all nodded together . " 1 thought of a girl back home in Iowa , who was only seventeen then , I thought of Martha . Then l heard this French girl calling to me from  --  the other room . " He sat forward again , and seemed to stiffen , and his voice , when he spoke again , seemed very far away . " Well , I got up and left the place . I guess I kinda ran out on her . It was n't until I got into the street that 1 realized I was carrying my glass , and it still had some port wine in it . I put it down somewhere , and went on walking . I must 've walked for miles . The next thing I really remember , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me . " He broke off his recital to finish his drink , and then he stood up . " After that , for a while , I went into a nose dive , kinda what the docs call nervous prostitution , " he ( and Sigmund Freud ) said . None of us laughed , or even smiled . " There were a lot of songs we all sang in those days , " he said , " some of them , well , kinda naughty , as the ladies say . T was thinking of them today , walking around Paris , I was thinking about a lot of things . Seemed like it was 191B again , and I was young and back in Paris . " He picked up his glass from the table and drained the last drop , and set it down again . " This girl , this Frances , gets in my dreams sometimes , too . But the door is always locked , or something , or the floor to the other room is gone , like it was blown away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe this one will now , " I said , trying to be cheerful . " Well , " Barrett said , " you 've all been very nice to me today , and I appreciate it , and I know Martha will , too . I wish you could meet Martha . She 's very sweet . I do n't know what I would have done wit hout Martha . She 's got me through a lot of things . " " Oh , we 'll see you again , " my wife said , " and Martha , too . Tell her I 'll send her some flowers . How long are you going to be here ? " " Three days , " Barrett said , " three days , and then we 're sailing back on the Liberti . I like the French ships , I like France . " Linda suddenly stood up , and ran , rather than walked , around the table . She was tall , in the manner of American girls of today , almost as tall as Barrett , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the forehead . " I like you , too , " she said , warmly . " I think you 're lovely . " He patted her hand twice , and then said something none of us could understand , and hurriedly walked away . " I 'm sixty years old myself , " I said , " but mighty spry for a man that age , and I 'll be even spryer if we have another drink . " " I should say we all need what you Americans call a Hock of drinks , " Middleton said . My wife called Jacques . BEFORE we left the Continental bar , all of us except Middleton had reached the point where we were n't quite sure we were still drinking . At that point , I have an inveterate tendency to sing , and my wife sensed this moment had come . " Not here in the bar , " she said . " You can sing in the cab on the way to the ChOpe Danton . " In the cab , I said , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' or ' Where a Nightingale is Singing and a Pale Moon Beams ' ? " " Not that , not one of them , " Linda said . " I want to hear ' Combien pour Toute la Nuit ? ' " And so I sang for her , in fair voice , and on key for once in my life , " Cornbien pour Toute la Nuit ? "
