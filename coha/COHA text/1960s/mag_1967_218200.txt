THE MEDIUM IS THE MASSAGE by Marshall McLuhan and Quentin Fiore . 159 pages . Banfam. $1.45 . <P> <P> " Good morning ! " says a raw egg , lolling in a shallow dish , its yolk bearing an advertisement for a no-pressure printing technique , proving that the ovum can become a commercial . Noses nudge knowingly from a page dealing with psephology . Five pages of pebbled and scaly abstract photography resolve themselves into a closeup of human toes to make the point : " The wheel is an extension of the foot . " One entire spread is printed in Leonardo-like " mirror writing , " and another is set upside down just to show how absurd the whole concept of books can be . Indeed , the authors of this eye-stopping , mind-wrenching whatzis have created the ultimate in non-books . <P> <P> Canada 's All-Purpose Prophet Marshall McLuhan , soon to be enchaired at Fordham University , has argued for years that the book is obsolescent . Unfortunately , his major testaments ( The Gutenberg Galaxy , Understanding Media ) , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntax and mastodonian metaphors . Now , with the artful aid of a graphics designer , Quentin Fiore , McLuhan gets his message across more appropriately by juxtaposing his text with pictures . The result is a punchy put-on , to be sure , but that only serves to make a point : McLuhan has never taken himself as seriously as his critics have ; his cheerful objective is to stir up some fresh thought . <P> The book restates McLuhan 's increasingly familiar argument : the introduction of the alphabet 3,000 years ago , abetted by Gutenberg 's introduction of movable print in the 15th century , turned mankind into the alphas and omegas of a giant cultural alphabet soup . The " seamless " and communal thought processes of tribal , preliterate man were fragmented ; perception itself took on the rigid , abecedarian character of writing . Letters led to the " idea , " which required structure-beginning , middle , end-and forced the writer or reader out of immediate experience and into an abstracted , objective remove from " group reality . " According to McLuhan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , television and telephones-has changed all that . Man today is returning , through the vacuum tube , to a tribal-type perception , and is no longer tied to rational , sequential modes of thought . <P> For those who have yet to understand McLuhan , this book is a provocative primer . In both text and pictures , it uses the zany Zen technique of shattering orderly thought with irrational accident . Even the title is a gag , deriving from McLuhan 's earlier pronouncement : " The medium is the message . " That meant , as any anthropologist might have put it , that technology predetermines social structure ; hence , tools prefigure the psychology of their users . By punningly altering the slogan , McLuhan merely means that " all media work us over completely . "
