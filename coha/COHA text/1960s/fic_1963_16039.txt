Commencez , Mesdames et Messieurs  --  begin , ladies and gentlemen  --  signore e signori , comminciate ! The EMCEE now circulates , forming teams , telling the patrons to line up , making sure there is a woman next to every man . REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line . Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin , held securely against the chest , of each man at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game to begin and the band to play , the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under their chins to under the chins of the women  --  without using their hands .  --  28  --  ( This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one 's partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partner 's throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line , where the process begins anew . However , the slightest miscalculation , which can be brought about by any number of human frailties  --  haste , modesty , inhibition or lack of co-ordination  --  will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor where it can only be picked up by the chin or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other , less proper , spot on the human anatomy , forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it  --  again , with the chin only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying to old friends , or even new friends who wish to become old friends , but can only be a torment for total strangers and/or the English ) . 91 .

TWO SHOT  --  PETER AND GIRL It is his turn to take the orange from a very short , but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress ( held up by an abundance of cantilever ) . PETER takes when he sees the twin obstacles which might  --  and probably will  --  encumber the game but increase his worldly experience . The contest begins : because of her stature he is forced to move in low , making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult , if not impossible . Then , inexorably , the orange starts to slip down the GIRL 's front . Manfully he goes after it . 93 . CLOSE SHOT  --  REGGIE She is enjoying it thoroughly . 94 . TWO SHOT  --  PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontal half-nelson , PETER makes a last valiant effort and voil , grips the orange under his chin  --  amid much cheering and congratulations from members of his TEAM .

Then , for a moment , the game and the onlookers seem less important than their proximity . But , alas , they are too good despite themselves and the transfer is accomplished  --  again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM . REGGIE , with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin , turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON , the short , fat , balding man seen at the funeral and later in BARTHOLOMEW 's photo .  --  29  --  REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly . Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly in REGGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND GIDEON Her eyes show her fright as he whispers : &nbsp; GIDEONMrs .

Her Majesty 's delegation has listened with great patience to the Southern European position on this problem , and while we find it charmingly stated , we can not possibly agree with its content . In 1937 , in the British colonies of Kenya , Uganda and Tanganyika  --  and , if I 'm not mistaken , more or less in Somaliland  --  a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis -- vis arable land which had never before known the plough , beginning before the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of Western Europe . In 1937 , therefore , Her Majesty 's Government  --  at that time His Majesty 's Government  --  was able to properly assay the situation . We therefore oppose the resolution . 316B . INT .
