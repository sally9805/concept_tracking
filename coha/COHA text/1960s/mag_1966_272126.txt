Around the Manhattan headquarters of American Airlines , one corridor gag is that " More women have gone to sleep with Bob Hall than with any other man in the world , " and that 's probably true . <P> Bob Hall is a 41-year-old radio veteran who once played the lead in the Green Hornet and dutifully goes home every morning to his wife and child . Yet he really operates during the witching hours . From 11:30 p.m. until 5:30 a.m. five days a week ( and until 7:30 a.m. the sixth ) , he is the Manhattan-based disk jockey of CBS 's Music ' til Dawn , sponsored by American . Hall 's silky phrasing and boudoir baritone earn him $40,500 a year , are emulated ( on producer 's orders ) by the eight other Music ' til Dawn deejays. * <P> Through its nine strategically placed stations , the show covers the U.S. during the sleeping hours like-well-a blanket . Last year 20 million Americans tuned in , many of them every night . Besides having Boudoir Bob , the show 's Hallmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affluent , educated audiences more than do the big-beat or hot-line interviews on competing stations . A market survey showed that 60% of the listeners were late-working students , technicians , professional men and executives-just the kind of people who most use airlines . <P> It was just one of those executives , American 's present chairman , C.R. Smith , who conceived the show in 1953 , after a frustrating night of " flipping the dial on my radio and not finding anything worth listening to . " Recalls Smith : " I do n't usually let personal preferences enter into business decisions , so I guess this was an exception . " He met with CBS President Frank Stanton , discovered that Stanton was " something of a night owl himself . " CBS and American jointly formulated the music show . Its records were to be , in Smith 's words , " on a high , not necessarily highbrow , level . " The commercials were to be soft-sell , the disk jockeys positively pianissimo , and everything uniform nationwide . <P> The show 's producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 36 ) , prescribes the records for all nine stations . He even decides the order : Mantovani on early , when the audience is biggest ; heavier music for the wee-hours elite ; then progressively lighter as the milkmen switch on . Hall and the other deejays only announce the selections , rip and read the news , voice the commercials . Sometimes , when a big commercial plane crash is in the news , there is a moratorium on commercials . <P> Such simple programming may not be anything to write home about , but Music ' til Dawn gets a remarkable 15,000 letters of gratitude annually . This year it won a Peabody Award " for unique contribution to the culture of America . " <P> <P> * The eight : Boston 's Jack Lazare , Chicago 's Jay Andres , Cincinnati 's Jack Gwyn , Dallas ' Tony Garrett , Detroit 's Jay Roberts , Hollywood 's George Walsh , San Francisco 's Ken Ackerman , Washington 's Terry Hourigan.                 @ @ @ @
