The House of Representatives last week passed the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 - the dry-as-dust title of a measure that is likely to affect the lives and fortunes of Americans for many years to come . The 298-to-125 vote was unexpectedly large , and the Kennedy Administration , after a series of bitter legislative setbacks , understandably congratulated itself on a significant victory . But the issue was in fact much harder fought than the vote indicated , and the outcome was in doubt until the final hours . <P> Down to Zero . What saved the bill , in the final analysis , was its merit . It is probably the best and the boldest measure presented so far to the Congress by the Kennedy Administration . If passed by the Senate ( which seems highly probable ) , it will give the President , for the first time in U.S. history , sweeping powers to slash tariffs down as far as zero on many products in return for tariff concessions by other nations . Only a few years ago , such a bill would have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Common Market , long an ephemeral concept to most Americans , has taken shape as the embodiment of an invigorated and competitive Europe that the U.S. can ignore only at its peril . The Common Market-and the growing tendency of other nations to join in trade blocs-meant one thing to the U.S. economy : in order to overcome the tariff favoritism granted to each other by the Market 's member nations , the U.S. must be able to bargain for a share of the new and potentially huge market-or find itself on the outside looking in . Since nearly a third of all American exports now go to Europe , exclusion or crippling barriers would mean not only the loss of important markets , but a crushing blow to U.S. hopes of cutting the balance-of-payments deficit by promoting wider trade . <P> To President Kennedy the trade expansion bill was vital . It could , he said , " affect the unity of the West , the course of the cold war , and the growth of our nation for a generation or more to come . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman-came out for its passage . The Committee for a National Trade Policy , a bipartisan business group , strove to convince the nation of the bill 's importance . <P> House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills of Arkansas , who has given the Kennedy Administration trouble on other measures , carefully and lovingly tailored the trade revision act so as to ensure House passage . In the light of all this , it is a remarkable fact that the bill , for a couple of cliffhanging days , seemed likely to fail . <P> A to Z. Why ? There were several threatening factors . Protectionism is moribund as a national issue , but there were still plenty of businessmen-from almond growers to zinc producers-who were agitating against the bill . President Kennedy has presented a good many politically shaped bills to Congress-and has condemned , in political terms , those Congressmen who have not gone along with him . <P> Thus some Congressmen figured that they might as well have the game with the name , particularly since they could thereby cater to some of the businessmen back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Republicans were resentful of the high-pressure lobbying tactics used by the Kennedy Administration .
