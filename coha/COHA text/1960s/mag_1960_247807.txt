By horseback and on foot , 300 Colombian peasants in ponchos and floppy felt hats trekked through the jungles and coffee fincas to a settlement in the Andean backlands 25 miles outside Bogot . The men carried leaflets : " Viva the organized masses ! " A Red caudillo , Vctor Julio Merchn , delivered a welcoming harangue , and the stubble-bearded troop responded with a clenched-fist salute . From an equally isolated redoubt not far to the east , a second Red band , commanded by Juan de la Cruz Varela , peddled at gunpoint 1 peso coupons bearing Lenin 's picture and the appeal : " For a great Communist Party . " <P> Lords of Upheaval . Called Viot and Sumapaz , the two Red enclaves of backlands Bolshevism in Colombia have been in existence for years , making trouble for democracy in Latin America long before anyone heard of Fidel Castro . The rugged , roadless terrain offers little hindrance to guerrilla movements , while effectively blunting any military reprisal or concerted government program of building and social reform that might dilute Communist influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merchn in Viot , Varela in Sumapaz , are as much masters of their lands as any feudal lord . They fly a hammer-and-sickle flag , liquidate or banish dissenters , brainwash the populace with dinning P.A. systems , maintain their own efficient militia backed by arsenals that include machine guns and mortars . They even collect their own taxes , currently set at 10% of harvests . <P> Fortunes &; Murder . From his headquarters hamlet of Brasil , pudgy Victor Merchn , 52 , wields power in a 5-sq. - mi. area , on the fringes of which anti-Communist coffeemen patrol their land with rifles . Born of coffee-bean pluckers but now enjoying a fortune from his tax rake-off , Merchn studied two years in Moscow , returned to indoctrinate Colombians and , around 1930 , incited peasants to overrun most of the area 's coffee plantations . <P> More powerful still is wily , slit-eyed Juan de la Cruz Varela , 57 , who bosses a 3,300 sq.mi. state-within-a-state , polices Sumapaz with a 150-man cavalry . Anyone , even high central government officials , who wishes to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself agrarian reformer and has even got himself elected to Colombia 's Congress on the votes of poverty-ridden peasants ( 3,741 Colombians died of starvation and malnutrition in 1958 ; 1,300,000 are landless today ) . But Varela 's real job is keeping Communism 's flag flying , no matter the cost . Last September a gang massacred four of Varela 's brothers , all antiCommunists . Witnesses say the men who did the job looked very much like Varela 's militiamen . <P> <P> Symptom of Ills . Colombia 's President Alberto Lleras Camargo , who wants to eradicate the Communist enclaves and push through roads and reform , has had little success so far . Neither the Colombian army , which fought well in Korea but has little taste for guerrilla warfare , nor the bureaucrats show much initiative . <P>
