I WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE PRESIDENT , read the headline in a Djakarta newspaper . The words heralded the testimony of onetime Central Bank Minister Jusuf Muda Dalam , 52 , who last week became the first of President Su karno 's former Cabinet members to be put on trial by the new regime of General Suharto . <P> <P> Jusuf was charged with just about everything , from having six wives-two more than the Islamic law allows-to embezzling $10 million from the country 's treasury . But the intent of the trial seemed broader than simply bringing Jusuf to justice . It apparently marked the start of a campaign by Indonesia 's new rulers to undermine Sukarno 's in fluence by linking him to his ministers ' misdeeds . For one thing , the prosecution charged that Sukarno had encouraged Jusuf to use his influence with importers to collect " contributions " for Sukarno 's Fund of the Republic , which had financed the construction of prestige projects . And from a witness came testimony that the Bung had ordered him to hand over a luxurious house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sukarno himself had triggered the trial by becoming so assertive in recent weeks . At last month 's Inde pendence Day celebration , Sukarno flatly denounced the new regime 's decision to rejoin the United Nations and to end konfrontasi with Malaysia , and called for a return to his old policies . His defiance stirred his followers in Ban dung to attack anti-Sukarno student groups , killing one anti-Sukarno youth , and setting off retaliatory riots in Djakarta . Fearful that people-packed Java ( pop . 70 million ) might erupt in full-scale riots , General Suharto ordered the Djakarta students to cool it and started the trials instead . <P> <P> Whether the former bank chief 's dis closures would tarnish Sukarno 's image with the Indonesian masses is questionable . But General Suharto was patient . Scheduled for trial are 14 more former Cabinet members , including onetime Deputy Premier Subandrio , who , say military investigators , masterminded the plot with Sukarno 's support-to steer Indonesia into Peking 's camp via last October 's abortive Communist coup .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
