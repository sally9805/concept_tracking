No cause ever fought has been fought against more stupid , blind social prejudice , not even the cause of the people against the divine rights of kings , nor the cause of equal suffrage , nor any of the battles of freedom . <P> - Pearl Buck , on the 21st anniversary of the birth control movement <P> Family planning by contraception was the cause . Margaret Sanger was its champion . Half a century ago , when she raised the banners of her lonely crusade , she was lacerated from the pulpits as a " lascivious monster " bent on " murdering " unborn children . Birth control , a phrase she herself invented , was unmentionable , immoral and illegal . It was a federal crime merely to send information about it through the mails . She was arrested eight times . Her zeal led to the breakup of her first marriage . Yet when she died last week of arteriosclerosis in Tucson at the age of 82 , her vision had been realized beyond her dreams . Birth control , which to her meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own family , had become accepted in the U.S. , and was spreading rapidly throughout the world . <P> What makes her success even more remarkable is that Margaret Sanger was no tough-talking , mannish feminist . Even when she wore severely tailored suits to appear more formidable , she could not conceal her obvious femininity . She was a radiant , vivacious redhead , scarcely 5 ft. tall , who left scores of suitors in her wake . <P> " Sleep on the Roof . " Margaret Sanger grew up in Corning , N.Y. , the sixth of eleven children . Her mother died of tuberculosis at 48 . In New York at 17 , Margaret married Architect William Sanger and soon joined the Socialist Party . She toiled as a nurse in the tenements of the Lower East Side . <P> On a sweltering day in July 1912 , Nurse Sanger threaded her way through pushcarts to a cramped flat in a Grand Street tenement . Sadie Sachs , 28 , wife of a truck driver and mother of three , was near death as the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor : " Another baby will finish me . What can I do to prevent it ? " The doctor 's gruff reply : " Tell Jake to sleep on the roof . " Three months later , Sadie Sachs was dead-of another self-induced abortion . Margaret Sanger had a cause . <P> In 1913 , in birth control clinics of France and Scotland , she listened , watched , learned , then returned to publish , write and edit a magazine called Woman Rebel . Its motto : " No Gods , No Masters . " Her first editorial promised subsequent stories on birth control ; postal inspectors grabbed up copies , and she was indicted on nine counts of sending birth control information through the mails . Deciding she needed time to prepare her defense , she left her three children with a nurse . Without court permission , without a passport , and under the alias " Bertha Watson , " she left on a midnight train for Montreal and thence to Europe . <P> " You 're No Woman ! " By the time she returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract public support . Besides , the first issue of Woman Rebel had only promised the illegal stories ; it had not delivered them . The Govern ment withdrew its indictment .
