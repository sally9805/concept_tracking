Racial intermarriage is potentially the most combustible of all civil rights issues . Although marriage between whites and Negroes is actually rare in the U.S.-at least officially-miscegenation by cohabitation is another matter , rooted largely in the South 's unspoken mores . According to one study by University of Wisconsin Sociologist Robert Stuckert , 21% of white Americans are " descendants of persons of African origin . " By the calculation of Anthropologist Melville Herskovitz , 72% of U.S. Negroes have white ancestors . <P> The interracial statistics have piled up despite the fact that miscegenation under any circumstances at all is a crime in 19 states-including not only 17 Southern and Border states but also the Northern states of Indiana and Wyoming . Quite apart from local fears and customs even at this stage of the civil rights revolution , are such laws constitutional ? <P> New Concept . Last week the Supreme Court took a giant step toward resolving the question by agreeing to review its first miscegenation case since 1883 , when it upheld an Alabama law against interracial sexual relations ( Pace v. Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbids a man and woman who are not married to each other and are of different races to " habitually live in and occupy in the nighttime the same room . " <P> Connie Hoffman , a white woman , and Dewey McLaughlin , a Spanish-speaking merchant seaman of Honduran origin , were convicted under this law in Miami Beach in 1962 . Each was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $150 fine . The defendants appealed to the Florida Supreme Court and were turned down in light of what Justice Millard Caldwell called " the sound rule of stare decisis " ( following precedents ) and " the well-written decision " of Pace . Let the U.S. Supreme Court decide , added Caldwell caustically , " if the newfound concept of ' social justice ' has outdated ' the law of the land ' as therein announced . " <P> Frail Standard . To just that end , the N.A.A.C.P. argued in Washington that Defendants Hoffman and McLaughlin ( who are still living together ) were deprived of the 14th Amendment 's guarantees of due process and equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by unmarried persons of the same race , for example , and the defendants were unable to plead common-law marriage because Florida forbids intermarriage under another law , which the N.A.A.C.P. also wants struck down . Moreover , Florida 's definition of Negro ( " every person having one-eighth or more of African or Negro b'ood " ) is so vague that police merely identified McLaughlin as a Negro by " appearance , " a frail standard on which to build a case . <P> How much the ruling in McLaughlin and Hoffman v. Florida will affect other state miscegenation laws will not be known until the court hands down its decision next fall . But the tide seems to be running against the old Southern custom . In 1948 , the California State Supreme Court ruled California 's miscegenation law unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment . Antimiscegenation laws have since been repealed in other states ; in Nebraska one was wiped off the books only last year . Goal of the N.A.A.C.P. in this case : " Freedom to join in marriage with the person of one 's own choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
