Even for the surrealistic Congo , the scene seemed weird as the Congolese Central Government 's Premier Cyrille Adoula sat down to negotiate with his archenemy , Katanga 's Moise Tshombe . The meeting place itself was strange enough-a hospital waiting room at a United Nations military base . And how did the angry foes start their discussion of the embattled Congo 's future ? With a fond embrace , knee-slapping guffaws and a day of jokes and laughter . <P> Palaver over Parley . In Elisabethville , the bitter little two-week war was , for the moment , over ; only the scattered shots of occasional snipers broke the temporary truce . The U.N . was in control , having achieved its " limited objective " as defined by U.S. Under Secretary of State George Ball : " Freedom of movement for the peace-keeping forces , without the daily , bloody harassment by local Katanga troops , whipped into excited and irresponsible action by rumor , radio and beer . " After that , it became the task of hard-working U.S. Ambassador Edmund Gullion to corral Tshombe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring him face to face with Adoula . Guaranteed safe passage , Tshombe agreed to fly-in President Eisenhower 's old Columbine III-to the meeting in Kitona , a sweltering settlement near the mouth of the Congo River on the Atlantic . <P> " Hello , you old rascal , " Tshombe grinned , shaking hands with Adoula in the second-floor waiting room of the Kitona hospital . " How 've you been ? " replied Adoula as he hugged his old adversary and escorted him into the troops ' mess for some food and reminiscences . <P> The U.N . had hoped the serious talks could start at once , but both sides were clearly determined to conduct things in the traditional Congolese way-lots of genial palaver as a preliminary buildup . In the afternoon , Tshombe napped in a high , hard hospital bed , while Adoula and several members of his delegation took a sightseeing tour along the cliffs over the Congo estuary . " That night the friendly palaver continued over beer , dinner , and lots of jokes about each other 's misdeeds . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business next morning . <P> Flat Refusal . Gullion , with U.N . Un der Secretary Ralph Bunche and his top U.N . advisers , waited anxiously outside as the two delegations finally took their places around three simple green-topped tables . Now the jesting was over ; loud voices could be heard in the corridor out side as Adoula made his demands that secessionist Katanga accept Leopoldville 's control without qualification . At 3 p.m. the conferees ordered in beer and sandwiches , kept talking while they ate . At 8:30 p.m. came the call for more food , and this time some whisky . It now appeared that Tshombe was flatly refusing to commit his Katanga province to the Congo 's Belgian-drafted provisional constitution , the Loi Fondamentale . <P> Just before midnight , the doors burst open and Adoula charged out , muttering angrily at Tshombe 's intransigence . There was , he huffed , no point in continuing . Tshombe agreed , and ordered his plane made ready for the trip home .               @ @ @ @ @ @
