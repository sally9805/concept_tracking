In the Year of the Pig is a new kind of chiller movie . Audiences sit in helpless frustration watching scenes of unreeling historical horror . Producer-Director Emile de Antonio ( Point of Order ) has taken his ghoulish episodes from newsreels made in and about Viet Nam over the past three decades . The result is a slanted but devastating account of the spiraling American involvement in Southeast Asia . <P> The cast of characters-politicians , journalists , civilians , combatants-at once supply historical continuity and act as a kind of tragic chorus . Journalists like Jean Lacouture and David Halberstam recount the development and deepening of the war . Meanwhile the screen shows scenes of John Foster Dulles promulgating his doctrine of " collective security " and French troops vanquished at Dienbienphu . There are glimpses of wartime savagery on both sides , and there is even some comic relief , as when Madame Nhu announces " About that question of the rubber stamp parliament : I have repeatedly said , ' But what 's wrong to rubber-stamp the laws we approve ? ' " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le May announcing , " The world is watching us in Viet Nam to see if we put our money where our mouth is , " and Colonel George S. Patton III , with an aw-shucks grin , beaming into the camera and describing ARVN enthusiastically as a " bloody good bunch of killers . " <P> A powerful if oversimplified introduction to the political and moral morass of Vietnam , In the Year of the Pig is ultimately confounded by its own sense of outrage . Such a partisan representation of history is better known by the much-abused term propaganda , and its message gets across to those who come into the theater already in sympathy with what it has to say .
