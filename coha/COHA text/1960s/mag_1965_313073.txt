Only after an unusually high-pressure vote-gathering drive in June did the Johnson Administration 's rent-subsidy bill pass the House - and then only by a hairsbreadth 208-to-202 margin . When the bill , authorizing the Government to help lowincome , elderly and handi capped families pay their rent , cleared the Senate by a 54-to-30 vote July 15 , it was a particularly prideful victory for Lyndon Johnson . <P> The President exulted too soon . Last week , thanks to an incredible blunder by Housing and Home Finance Agency Administrator Robert Weaver , the pro gram was dead . Its demise was hastened by the curiosity of Michigan Republican James Harvey , 43 , who found HHFA experts suspiciously reluctant to circulate the regulations covering financial eligibility for rent aid . Harvey demanded a copy and , as a member of the House 's housing subcommittee , got one immediately . To his astonishment , Harvey found that under Weaver 's HHFA-approved rules relating to the elderly and the handicapped ( who could collect up to 70% of their rent from the Government ) , applicants might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets as high as $25,000 . <P> Harvey was appalled . " I do n't think 90% of the members of the House have $25,000 in net assets , " he gasped . " The regulations were clearly contrary to the bill as passed by Congress . " Since the House had yet to appropriate funds for the program , Harvey moved to cut off all $6,000,000 earmarked for rent subsidies . " The Congress of the United States has decided that this was going to be a program for low-income people of America , " he declared . " They have made this program one for the rich people of America . " <P> Though the Democratic leadership tried gamely to defend Weaver 's gaffe , Harvey 's motion to cancel rent funds passed by 185 votes to 162 . Twenty-five House members who had backed the bill last summer now voted to kill it . <P> Weaver could easily have avoided the fiasco by discussing the bill 's income provisions with Congressional leaders in advance-or simply by waiting to write them until after the funds were appropriated . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate to become the U.S. 's first Negro Cabinet officer as Secretary of the new Department of Housing and Urban Development , could hardly have dealt the boss a more painful blow if he had tried .
