txt Washington A rundown of Democratic prospects for 1966 ? from Democratic sources  --  discloses the normal amount of caution one would expect from a party in power facing an off-year election . But it is significant that these Democratic strategists see possible losses in House races threatening passage of the next phase of the President 's program  --  whatever that may be . " Look at it this way , " one veteran Democratic campaign analyst said : " If we lose as many as 30 seats in the House , the President 's new program wo n't have a chance . And what he will be proposing will be new  --  for he 's got about everything else through this Congress . " The pessimism really focuses on the House prospects . The Democrats see the possibility of " picking up a couple of seats in the Senate . " The hard look at House prospects does not go so far as to see the possibility of losing that body to the Republicans . Democratic " trouble spots , " as seen by the Democrats : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , and Wisconsin , where Democrats feel they made their greatest 1964 inroads into Republican strongholds . Democratic explanation : " This is the old ' isolationist ' belt . Voters have always reacted strongly when there has been a threat of war . The unknown ingredient is Vietnam . If it keeps building up , we could lose those marginal and even Republican districts where we made gains last year . Already Republicans are calling this the Johnson war . " ? Suburbs and those districts of big metropolitan centers where the white population is in a sizable majority . Explanation : " Apprehension among whites is growing , as the result of what we see in Los Angeles , Chicago , Springfield , Mass . If these riots keep going ( and we pray that they wo n't ) , people in large-population areas will continue to be even more // * Democrats fidget over House in ' 66 // apprehensive . This feeling could work against the party in power at the polls . " The Democrats are particularly worried about such high-population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? capable of going either way in any given election : " Even if they have n't seen riots , . these people have been looking at TV . They may react . " Redistricting impact ? New districts that have resulted from recent congressional redistricting : " We might lose from five to eight seats as the result of these changes . We were helped in only three districts with GOP incumbents . " ? The South : " We must take this into consideration . There will be a further expansion of GOP gains in the South . " again . In these statewide races the DemoThe Senate picture is something else again . In these statewide races the Democrats expect to command much of the same big , metropolitan center vote ( including Negro and ethnic groups ) that boosted the Johnson victory margins . Marked as " good chance of winning " among seats held by Republican senatorial incumbents : " Nebraska ? if Gov . Frank B. Morrison runs against Sen. Roman L. Hruska , Iowa ? if Gov . Harold E. Hughes runs against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be beat . Likely opponents are Attorney General Waggoner Carr or Rep. James C. Wright Jr . " Delaware ? if former Gov . Elbert N. Carvel takes on Sen. J. Caleb Boggs . " Varsity try ' Democrats see a " fair chance " of beating Sen. Milward L. Simpson in Wyoming . Also they will make a " varsity try " against Sen. Gordon Allott in Colorado . Democrats also see some races where their own incumbents are possibly " vulnerable " : " Sen. Maurine B. Neuberger in Oregon if Gov . Mark 0 . Hatfield runs against her . Sen. Pat McNamara in Michigan if Gov , George Romney is the opponent . Sen. Claiborne Pell in Rhode Island if Gov . John H. Chafee is the opponent . " Also Sen. Fred R. Harris in Oklahoma if Gov . Henry Bellmon or Bud Wilkinson runs against him . " The Democratic pessimism in the 1966 congressional races stems largely from a look at history . In off-year elections the party out of power almost always has picked up congressional seats . The year 1934 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency ) picked up nine seats , was one exception . But , at this point anyway , there seems to be no mood here among the Democrats to see 1966 as another variant from the norm . Part of this attitude is doubtless an effort to see to it that no complacency enters into the corning campaign in a party that enjoyed such overwhelming success last year . But there is also ample evidence that there is deep Democratic anxiety over what may happen to their big margin in the House .
