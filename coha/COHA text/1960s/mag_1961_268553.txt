The bitterest potion Konrad Adenauer had to swallow last week was dispensed by a politician young enough-and tough enough-to be his grandson . As boss of West Germany 's right-wing Free Democrats , Erich Mende , 44 , has remade an ineffectual , faction-riven third party into a political force with overwhelming appeal to disenchanted members of Adenauer 's Christian Democratic Party . Since their ideas for an " independent " West German foreign policy may well have influence in a coalition government , the Free Democrats may also prove thorny to the entire West . <P> Halfway House . The party 's opposition to der Alte rests largely in its conviction that the time has come for West Germany to resist automatic alignment with the West , pursue a new nationalism in world affairs . Putting national goals ahead of its European interests , Erich Mende argues that his country should go along with the European Common Market only if its membership does not jeopardize eventual reunification of Germany-for which , if necessary , it would negotiate directly with East Germany . While it supports NATO as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate regional disarmament in Central Europe as a basis for German reunification . <P> At home , the Free Democrats staunchly oppose expansion of West Germany 's welfare state , clamor for government withdrawal from such fields as shipping and housing .

One story on Bonn 's cocktail-party circuit maintains that when attractive Margot Mende ( his second wife ) awakens her husband each morning , she intones : " Get up ; it 's time to continue with your career . " He is also faulted for vanity , is highly sensitive about his weight ( 198 Ibs. ) , and hopefully submits to every known waist-trimming ritual , from yoghurt breakfasts to ice-cold baths . In the last phase of his campaign , Mende nonetheless proved himself an attractive , articulate campaigner whose greying hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shah of Iran . <P> Power Technicians . Born in a part of Germany that was swallowed by Poland after the war , Erich Mende was reared in the strongly nationalistic atmosphere peculiar to Grenzlanddeutsche ( border area ) households . After getting through high school on a succession of scholarships , he joined an infantry regiment for his military service in 1936 , decided to stay on as a career officer . Wounded three times in World War II , Mende collected a shelf of Iron and gold Crosses .
