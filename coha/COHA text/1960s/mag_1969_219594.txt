MARINE RESEARCH <P> In a small control room on the Bahamian island of North Bimini , Marine Biologist Arthur Myrberg pushed a button , then stared intently at a television monitor . Within half a minute , the TV screen came alive with thrashing sharks , groupers , snappers and other large inhabitants of the deep . Myrberg 's surprising underwater show had once again started on cue-as it does whenever he signals his aquatic actors . <P> By pressing the button , the University of Miami scientist had set off a low-frequency sound projector submerged in 60 ft. of water on the ocean floor . To any carnivorous fish within earshot , the signals probably seemed similar to the noises made by other fish when they are feeding , being attacked or under other conditions of stress . Excited by the apparent proximity of prey , the sharks and other predators greedily converged on the sound projector . <P> Sound Assumption . Myrberg 's shark-calling technique is an outgrowth of his studies of fish behavior financed by the Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he proceeded on the assumption that fish communicate better acoustically than by sight or smell . Sound , after all , is carried farther in water than in the air , and three or four times as fast . <P> For his initial study , Myrberg chose the bicolored damselfish , which is abundant and active in the clear waters off North Bimini and emits a large variety of sounds . By recording underwater noises and observing the behavior that accompanied each sound , he quickly learned parts of the damselfish language and began using it to control his subjects . By playing a recorded chirping sound , for example , he caused the damselfish to twist 45 degrees and then make a U-shaped dip , a pattern it often follows during spawning . Another recorded call actually caused color changes on the body of the fish . <P> " One day , " says Myrberg , " I was sitting there hitting the ' chirp ' button , but visibility was so bad that I could n't follow the little damselfish . " Frustrated , he told his sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner did the sound projector begin broadcasting a low-frequency tone than " bang , the whole area was filled with sharks . " A chance turn of the dials had paid off with completely unexpected information , <P> Finny Barrier . Scientists now foresee exciting possibilities in the control of fish by sonic commands . They might , for example , be used to lure dangerous fish away from swimming areas or from divers in the sea . There are even potential military applications . By broadcasting intermittently at a popular shark frequency , a sound projector could provide a moored ship with an effective finny barrier against enemy frogmen . <P> More impoitant , Myrberg 's studies of the linguistics of fish may help to fill the world 's food needs . Once sharks and other predators that normally swim singly or in small groups can be concentrated into selected areas , it may become profitable for commercial fishermen to " harvest " them , thereby tapping a rich new source of protein . Similar tactics might be used to satisfy less adventuresome tastes in seafood . " If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open sea , " says Myrberg , " maybe some day we can make a snapper jump into a net .
