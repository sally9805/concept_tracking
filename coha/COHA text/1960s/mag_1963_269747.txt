The chemise family is a closely knit group . Fashion-conscious females who climbed out of the sack only a short while ago now find themselves climbing right back into the sack 's first cousin , the shift . Already a slender trend as winter waned , the shift really switched into high with the summer solstice . On beaches from Maine to Malibu , lissome Loreleis clad in the latest two-piece bathing suits arranged themselves across the sand , apparently to ponder such girth-shaking questions as : How is a girl going to look her best when she is n't looking her barest ? Thus , in a blinding flash , came the shift to shifts , biggest cover story in beachwear this season . <P> If the shift has a secret ( besides what 's under it ) , the secret is versatility . It comes in a vast selection of fabrics - solids or prints - varying in length from several inches above the knee right down to the ankle , though the definitive summer version is apt to be cotton , plain-necked , sleeveless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny bows . Priced from $2.98 to about $50.00 the shift can go practically anywhere on practically anyone . It is fine for toe-testing at the ocean 's edge , or to cover up wet bathing suits for drinks on the clubhouse verandah ( aprs beach , nothing picks one up like a good belt ) . It is also socially acceptable for cocktails and dinner at the most exclusive playgrounds in the East . And house wives love it . " Just perfect , " says one enthusiast , " not only cool , but some thing you can wear with individuality " belted or unbelted or belted low around the hips or even in an Empire line . " <P> While women of all ages traipse along happily with the trend , the male population has yet to embrace the shift in public . Provocative it may be , hinting at perfections scarcely imagined unless the wearer were rendered shiftless . But as fashion gives way to fat , milady often assumes shapes and sizes that require all-too-little imagination . There is an answer for that , too : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch fabric , burlap or denim that keeps her bulkiest problems right under the Big Top where they belong .
