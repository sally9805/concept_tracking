txt Support for Hanoi is the one point on which all Communist nations agree , whatever their differences on other matters . Moscow , Peking , Bucharest , Belgrade , Havana , and . Tirana ? capitals frequently at odds with one another on this or that issue  --  at least are unanimous in opposing United States " imperialism " in Vietnam and in upholding Hanoi 's cause . But there is no unanimous agreement among these countries as to how Hanoi shall be aided . Peking has refused time and again to cooperate with Moscow and the others in shipping military and economic material to North Vietnam . Furthermore , there is sharp divergence between Moscow and Peking over the acceptability of peace talks before American troops are withdrawn from South Vietnam . Moscow accepts Hanoi 's thesis that negotiations could begin once the United States stopped bombing North Vietnam . Peking vehemently dissents  --  insisting , in effect , on a total victory over American forces in South Vietnam . Western sources report that Moscow and Peking recently have agreed on a formula for unhindered transshipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be confirmed conclusively . But there have been hints that the formula provides for North Vietnam itself to take responsibility for Soviet aid goods at the Sino-Soviet border . This would allow Peking to keep up its angry dispute with Moscow on other subjects , without choking off aid essential to a cause both capitals support . ( Stories of recent Sino-Soviet rapproche ; . ment , incidentally , seem vastly overrated . Sino-Soviet trade goes on , though at a level lower than that of Peking 's trade with capitalistic Tokyo . ( Observers do not read any extraordinary // *Communists unite in support of Hanoi // significance into the visit of a Chinese delegation to Moscow . This is an annual event , for as long as trade itself continues , details must be negotiated . Meanwhile political events in China remain on an adamantly anti course . ) Moscow does not want the war in Vietnam to escalate to a point where a direct confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union occurs . But Western sources do not believe that Soviet anxiety on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even to persuade Hanoi to go to the conference table . Nevertheless , Soviet sources point out that Hanoi has already made one conciliatory gesture by offering to talk if the United States stopped bombing North Vietnam . Hanoi lost considerable face when Washington spurned the offer , these sources say . Even today , the sources said , talks could start when and if the bombing stops . But Washington seems intent on further escalation , from Moscow 's viewpoint . This means President Johnson is gambling that the Vietnam war can be cleared up militarily before the presidential elections of 1968 . If this is indeed the American aim , Moscow intends to see that it is foiled . It will provide whatever help Hanoi requires to keep the northern regime militarily afloat . " It 's up to the United States to make the first move . It should stop bombing North Vietnam , and then negotiations can start , " a young Soviet engineer told me the other day . We had met in a restaurant , and somehow the conversation got around to Vietnam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II , he was old enough to remember the hunger , the bombing , the advance and then the retreat of the Germans through his part of the country . A Soviet commentator made much the same sort of remark , but with a different nuance . After insisting that the United States must stop bombing the north , he criticized Peking also for obstructing negotiations . " I would n't go so far as to say Washington and Peking are in collusion , " he said , " but the fact is , both seem to be in. sisting on prolonging the war . " Moscow offers Washington no concrete inducements to start negotiations at this stage . But behind the dual theme of insistence on military support for Hanoi and an equal insistence on the necessity of negotiations , some observers sense the following implication : That the opening of peace talks might already ameliorate Hanoi 's intransigence by highlighting , not the already well-published Sino-Soviet dispute , but a clear and sharp divergence of view between Peking and Hanoi .
