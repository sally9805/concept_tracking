THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF UPTON SINCLAIR ( 342 pp. ) - Harcourt , Brace &; World ( $6.95 ) . <P> <P> In the absence of a public monument ( some outdoor version of the Laocoon would seem to be called for ) , Upton Sinclair has written his autobiography . <P> For those who came in late-anyone under 40-it should be explained that Upton Sinclair , now 84 , has had his finger in every pious and progressive cause since 1900 and has published 90 books , most of this unimaginable wordage being in the promotion of beliefs that range from socialism and mental telepathy to vegetarianism and teetotalism , and against Mammon-variously embodied as Privilege , the Trusts , the House of Morgan , the Press , etc . As monument , the book is touchingly human . As autobiography , it is something less ; success in that elusive art is achieved only by those whose quarrel has been with themselves rather than the world . Sinclair , who has quarreled with everybody else , has never found the slightest reason to criticize himself . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Cupid 's Darts . " Was it really genius ? " asked the wonderful old windbag of his own remote and astounding youth . A prodigy , certainly . The son of a boozy soft-goods drummer who was pathetically proud of his descent from a long line of Southern naval officers , Upton was a boy wonder . He was still in short pants and scarcely through his freshman year at New York 's City College ( he entered at 13 ) before he had written his first novel . At his peak , his output of hack work and potboiling romances reached a sizzling 8,000 words a day . Of the many millions of words he wrote , few are the right ones in the right order , but some defect of ear , taste or intelligence mercifully protected him from knowing this . <P> Then there was the matter of his socialism or " industrial democracy " or " social justice , " as he variously called his faith . He came to it , he says , out of social resentment ( the Sinclairs had come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quasi-religious phase , and he became one of its missionary preachers . It gave him fame and a million dollars from devout readers who devoured the prophet 's politics and did n't care a damn about his prose . <P> The books that brought him fame , from The Jungle ( about the Chicago stockyards ) to Boston ( the Sacco-Vanzetti trial ) and The Brass Check ( the capitalist press ) , were really fictionalized expose journalism ; they belong to social rather than literary history . It is not his fault that today he seems quaint and a bit comic , like Mrs. Amelia Bloomer . For better or for worse , the U.S. has taken a good deal of his advice . Strikers , for instance , whose cause Sinclair fought from Pasadena to Passaic , are no longer jailed out of hand by local police chiefs acting under the orders of the Chamber of Commerce . Late in his autobiography there is a wistful recognition of the fact that no one any longer thinks of him as an enemy of established society and that the world he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
