Britain 's House of Commons may be the " best club in Europe , " but many a member can hardly afford the honor of belonging . At the current M.P . ' s pay of $4,900 a year , both Laborites and Tories can agree that it is a constant struggle just to keep looking neat , let alone statesmanlike . After a year 's study of the problem , a special independent committee last week recommended salary increases of about 80% . It sounded like a staggering raise , but even the new salary of $9,100 a year ( v. $30,000 for U.S. Congressmen ) is far from lavish , considering that all official expenses , except for local telephone calls , trips to constituencies , and $50 worth of stationery a year , must come out of the members ' own pockets . <P> Endorsing the recommendation , Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson remarked that M.P.s without independent incomes are forced to exist in " intolerable conditions . " True enough . Many live in dreary bed-and-breakfast hotels in <P> Bloomsbury . One Laborite M.P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife in Scotland . Though the House of Commons dining room serves excellent food and wine-the roast pheasant and Chateau Cheval Blanc 1949 are particularly well regarded right now-quite a few members must stick to fish and chips in the cafeteria . Many can not afford a part-time secretary and are often seen in the library answering letters in longhand . <P> Businessmen-politicians , of course , can attend board meetings , lawyers can go to court , and journalists can polish off their stories in the mornings , devoting afternoons and evenings to Parliament . One of the busiest M.P.s is Tory Backbencher Sir Cyril Black , who at last count was chairman of some 40 companies and director of a dozen more . But the increasing number of teachers , white-collar employees and workers among M.P.s have a much harder time dividing their careers this way . Besides , with the growing amount of complex homework to be done , Parliament is becoming more and more of a round-the-clock job . <P> Under the proposed new scales , Cabinet members ( whose salaries in many cases have been frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Wilson is telling labor to hold the wage lines , he virtuously halved the committee 's proposed raise for ministers , who now would go from $14,000 to $23,800 . The Prime Minister , whose thrifty wife has fired the cook and does much of the housework herself , would go from $28,000 to $39,200.
