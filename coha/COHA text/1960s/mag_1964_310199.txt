STATE OF BUSINESS <P> Two hours before the tax cut was signed into law , American Telephone &; Telegraph Chairman Frederick R. Kappel received a long-distance call from one of his best customers : Lyndon Johnson . How , asked the President , would the measure affect A.T . &; T. 's plans ? As a direct result of the cut , said Kappel , A.T . &; T. would add another $100 million onto its record 1964 budget for capital spending , originally set at $3.25 billion . <P> Bigger capital investments by many U.S. companies will indeed be one of the major consequences of the tax bill ( see following story ) . But there will be countless other reverberations in the U.S. economy-and some of them are already being felt . An early and dramatic response took place on Wall Street , where the Dow-Jones industrial average climbed 3.10 points last week , nudging through the magic 800 mark to close at an alltime high of 800.14 . For millions of U.S. workers , the first effects of the tax cut will be noticeable this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher because of lower tax deductions . <P> The Administration predicts that the tax bill , which reduces individual income taxes by $9.1 billion , will help lift total personal income from $463 billion last year to $492 billion in 1964 . Confident that the U.S. consumer will put all that extra money to work , the Government also anticipates that his total spending will rise by $24 billion-$10 billion of it because of the tax cut-to $397 billion . Industrial production is expected to increase by at least 4.7% , and the gross national product will grow from $585 billion to $621 billion , creating some 3,000,000 more jobs-for a third of which the tax cut will be able to take credit .
