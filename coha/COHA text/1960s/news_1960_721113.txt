txt WASHINGTON , March 10 ? Air Force leaders promised Congress today that they would , as one put it , " set our house in order " on the subject of training manuals . Dudley C. Sharp , Secretary of the Air Force , and Gen Thomas D. White , the Chief of Staff , testified before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Manpower Utilization . Secretary Sharp was called to clarify his department 's position , after a manual linking communism with churches and other manuals giving instructions on washing dogs and mixing martinis were attacked and ridiculed . The civilian Secretary also sought to clear up differing versions of his previous testimony on . manuals before the House // Committee on Un-American Activities . Representative Francis E. Walter , Democrat of Pennsylvania and chairman of the committee , had said that Secretary Sharp agreed with the allegations of communism in the churches . The Secretary afterward denied ft . But parts of his testirnony given in closed session were then released , appearing Ito support Mr. Walter 's version . A " fair reading " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed Services subcommittee today , " shows that I was essentially reiterating * * * that we have a duty to alert our personnel to the fact that our churches are a target for Communist attempts at infiltration . " " I stated then that I did not know whether certain specific charges made in this manual had been proven , " Mr. Sharp ' said . He referred , in his testimony , to two manuals on security . One was Air Reserve Training Center Manual No. 45-0050 , which charged that Communists had successfully infiltrated the churches and named the National Council of Churches and some ministers by name . This manual has been withdrawn . Secretary Sharp also referred to a basic Air Force Manual 205-5 , which also touched on the subject . Some of the material in the basic manual has been ordered stricken but the manual itself has not been withdrawn . However , a substitute is now in preparation . Mr. Sharp said : " Individuals in the Air Force are representatives of individuals from all walks of life . We believe that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security , whether through training manuals or otherwise , we have taken a giant stride toward achieving effective security . " We consider it our duty to call the attention of our personnel to Communist activity . The method actually used in the training manual , however , was highly inappropriate and , as I have stated , the manual was withdrawn . In withdrawing this manual , we did not attempt to pass on the truth or falsity of certain statements contained in the manual . " General White , who said " we intend to clean up this problem and set our house in order , " stressed that manuals on appropriate subjects were of great value to some 1,000,000 men of the Air Force , Air National Guard and Reserves . However , because at one time the Air Force was required to induct airmen in the lowest category of intelligence acceptable for military service  --  Category IV  --  a tendency " crept in " to write guidance manuals " on every conceivable subject , " General White said . Now the Air Force no longer recruits men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many manuals as we have in the past , " he said . Both Air Force officials em-I , phasized that all training man- ' uaLs were being reviewed and that the number published would be curtailed . The Wisconsin Republican said that the manual should never have been withdrawn . Fie said that " the charges have n't been disproved one iota . "
