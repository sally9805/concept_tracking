Man , a man could wear himself out with all that marching . Besides , every middle-aged beard and his brother are out picketing for peace these days . So , turning from soles to souls , disillusioned Vietnik Ray Robinson Jr. , 29 , a Negro in blue denim , hit on the great couch-in formula for ending-the war .

" One young convert , recalling with distaste an abrasive cry from some demonstrators as they marched around the White House- " Hey , hey , L.B.J. , how many people did you kill today ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lyndon 's problems . Said he : " We 've got to let the President tell us about his pain . " <P> So successful was the 96-hour couch-in that the Soulniks decided to hold a press conference to spread the lovin ' word . They explained that the Hilton setting , if decidedly unspiritual , was essential to the cause . Said one : " You 've got to go to a swank downtown hotel , right down in the nittygritty groove , man , to get the press to come out . "
