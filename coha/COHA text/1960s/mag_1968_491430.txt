A late sun filtered through the decorative iron bars on the Gothic windows . Dr. Liam O'Brien . a short , dark Irishman with a tongue like an adder and a soft spot in his heart for all people who are mentally ill , sat at his desk in the stately old administration building of State Hospital No. 2 in St. Joseph , Mo . Just outside the doctor 's office a grand staircase with a red carpet and a fine carved-wood banister led down to an entrance hall floored in colored tile . In one corner a grandfather clock ticked away the generations . Here , in the past , anguished families would bring one of their poor deranged kinsmen and , reassured by the beauty and quiet of the entrance . way , leave him forever , content that he would be cared for gently and With compassion . " And if he proved unruly , they tranquilized him with this . " said Dr. O'Brien , slapping a leather harness strap into his palm . " And here was his medication . " He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a column : " ' Two ounces of whiskey every four hours , ' " he read . " Prescribed for everything from melancholia to myocarditis .

It has been only about six years since my predecessor here felt the community had advanced in its thinking far enough so that he could free the patients who were chained to the walls . " He rose . " Come on , " he said . and led the way along the corridors of his hospital until we reached a large room crammed with beds . They were placed head to foot , three rows deep , along each side , with only a knee 's width between one row and the next Down the narrow center passage , about 100 women , ranging in age from 16 to 80. sat in chairs or shuffled aimlessly about . There were old paretics , chronic schizophrenics , regressed psychotics , the demented senile : the whole sad spectrum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if one paused to listen to their babble , one might sense a great awareness , and a hurt . " Tell my momma tell my papa came get me ; tell my momma tell my papa come get me ... " a dark-haired girl repeated over and over in a toneless singsong . " Here are our worst , " said Dr. O'Brien , standing in the midst of them . A young girl . sucking both thumbs , came up and nuzzled her head against his chest . He held her gently . " I get white-faced with anger every time I come in here . Theseare our failures of the past . And what is there left to salvage here so late ? God knows , But we are going to try . " Six months later the results of his efforts were spectacularly visible . The ward was empty . The women had been moved out to nursing homes , to foster homes , to better quarters that opened up on other wards as St. Joseph 's bed-patient population , under the impact of a psychiatric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop from 2,000 to 1.450 . Dr. O'Brien 's determination that the forgotten patients on his back wards shall become human beings again is a manifestation of a new spirit of confidence . a new approach to the ancient problem of the mentally ill that now prevails in a majority of the country 's mental hospitals . Until only a very few years ago the attitude of most hospital staffs toward a mental patient was that of the jailer toward a prisoner . The sick person was to be fed , clothed , disciplined  --  with straitjackets. handcuffs , chains and clubs if necessary  --  and kept until he died . This was the situation when the Post . in a classic series of articles by John Bartlow Martin INsIDE THE Asvium , October 6-November 10 , 1956 exposed these dreadful facts of life as they affected the 750,000 men , women and children who were then hospitalized in the U.S. for mental illness . After months of research , Martin chose Columbus State Hospital in Ohio as a typical  --  and by no means the worst  --  example of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mentally ill who could not afford the luxury of private care . There , in one of the country 's wealthiest states , he found 2,700 patients served by 18 doctors , only 10 of whom ( none a fully trained psychiatrist gave daily psychiatric care on the wards . Some patients had been there for more than 60 years . On a daily budget allowance of $2.60 per patient per day , only about 400 were receiving any sort of therapy . The 2,300 others were merely there , in custody , helplessly awaiting death . Martin 's series stirred the conscience of the nation , but it was not until 1961 that a Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health , appointed by the Congress , confirmed on a national scale what Martin had uncovered in microcosm at . Coumbus . Its recommendations became the basis for President Kennedy 's plea to Congress for a national mental-health program ? " a wholly new emphasis and approach " to a problem that at onetime or another will afflict one of every three American families , The legislators responded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal grants for the construction of a nationwide network of community mental-health centers , each to serve a population of roughly 300,000 people , and to provide a wide range of services , from around-the-clock emergency care for the person suddenly gone out of control to outpatient clinics , halfway houses . and follow-up support by social workers and psychiatric nurses . Of the $150 million provided , $60 million has now been awarded for the construction and staffing of 128 centers in 42 states , Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia . Construction , though , is the quick and easy part . The problem lies in finding trained professionals to staff these centers . The National Committee Against Mental Illness , Inc. estimates the country needs at least 10,000 more psychiatrists than the 18,750 now in practice ( private practice . mainly ) , and psychologists , psychiatric nurses and psychiatric social workers are in equally short supply . The National Institute of Mental Health says that despite these shortages 175 of the new mental-health centers will open their doors in 1968 , and by 1970 , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years , however , the old state hospital will remain the last refuge for those who can not afford private hospital care . with its cost of about $35 a day , or the care of private psychiatrists , with fees ranging from $25 to $50 an hour . What . then , awaits the patient who still must turn to the public hospital for help ? The picture , formerly one of unrelieved darkness , is now one of mingled light and shadow . There are still areas  --  in the country as a whole and within individual hospitals , including the better ones  --  where the gloom is as deep as ever . But more and more the asylum is emerging from its apathy and despair . Traditionally a place of custody , it now is becoming a place of healing . In the 10 years following World War II . according to the National Committee Against Mental Illness , the number of bed patients in mental hospitals increased at the rate of 13,000 a year . But in the next 10 years the number dropped by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population in the nation 's 302 public mental hospitals has fallen to an estimated 426.000 , a new low . The reduction in hospital population does not mean that the incidence of mental illness is dropping . The pressures and frustrations of life are no less abrasive than in the past , and the " social breakdown syndrome , " manifested in a retreat from reality to a world of fantasy , is no less common . In consequence more people are entering mental hospitals today than ever before . Between 955 and 1965 , while the population of the U.S. was increasing by 17 percent , the nurnber of admissions to public mental hospitals each year increased by 76 percent , to 314,500 in 1965 , the last year for which complete figures are available . In this same period . however , the number of patients discharged each year more than doubled , reaching ' 287,000 in 1965 - an increase of 127 percent . Thus , more people are going into mental hospitals than ever before , but they no longer inevitably follow the dreary route of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hopeless gray oblivion of the back wards . Instead , a new emphasis on getting the patient into the hospital early , and then getting him out again as quickly as possible , has resulted in a considerable reduction in length of stay . Today , between 85 and 90 percent of patients entering a mental hospital for the first time can expect to be discharged within a year . In most cases they are strong enough to face once more the terrors that sent them there , although frequently they regress and have to come back again  --  and perhaps yet again . Of the 314,500 persons admitted in 1965 , some 115,500 ? more than one third  --  were returnees . But the important thing , nearly every expert agrees , is that those who enter need no longer abandon all hope . No one factor can account for this dramatic change ; rather , a combination of many factors is responsible . First , giving impetus to all the others , is a new tolerance of the mentally ill on the part of the community , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick person who has been to the hospital and has come home again . The community has begun to recognize what certain psychiatrists  --  the brothers Menninger , for example  --  long have recognized : The madness that destroys the personality is a madness that afflicts us all , only expressed in greater degree . And the fragmented personality is capable of being restored to some degree of dignity and pride . Public awareness that this can be done  --  and must be done in a society that calls itself civilized and compassionate  --  has recently been reflected in the greater generosity of state legislatures in support of their state hospitals . In the U.S. as a whole the average daily expenditure per patient in a mental hospital , while still grossly inadequate , has more than doubled since 1955 . As a direct result , so has the ratio of full-time hospital employees to patients  --  although there are still crippling shortages in the critical professional fields . Nearly a third of the country 's state hospitals have less than five staff psychiatrists , and 21 have none . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , most doctors believe , has been the development of tranquilizers and the other psychiatric drugs . It has long since been proved that the drugs do have the power to soothe the anxiety-ridden , calm the manic , stimulate the depressed and , for a moment at least . call the hallucinating mind back to the world of reality . It is equally clear that , in most cases , the drugs can only control symptoms , not cure the deeper illness . But by temporarily suppressing the symptoms of the basic illness , they do permit the doctor to get through to a patient , so that more lasting forms of therapy can be applied , These may range from a simple word of kindness , through work and play regimes , to the most deeply searching forms of psychotherapy . In many cases almost any positive action helps , when applied with love and understanding . which is why equally significant results are being achieved at hospitals experimenting with widely different techniques . They are simply different aspects of this quiet revolution . Nowhere is that revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high iron fence . the sprawling hospital looks as it has for more than half a century . The huge brickand-stucco buildings are shabby and run-down . But the patient population , which less than a decade ago stood at nearly 2.800 , was down to 1.330 at the end of 1967 ? proof of Dr. William Menninger 's assertion that it is brains , not bricks . that make a mental hospital a place of healing . Ever since Charles Dickens visited Boston State in 1842 and found it " admirably conducted on enlightened principles . " the ancient institution has enjoyed a reputation for zeal and skill in the treatment of the mentally ill . Its most rapid progress . however , began when Dr. Walter Earl Barton . superintendent from 1945 to 1963 , took the bold step of throwing open the big iron gates that for more than 100 years had separated the hospital 's patients from the world . Dr. Barton , who left Boston to become medical director of the American Psychiatric Assoriation , was succeeded by Dr. Milton Greenblatt. a slender , tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat worried cockatoo . For three years . until he , too , moved on to higher things as commissioner of mental health for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , Dr. Greenblatt sat like a nesting bird in a cluttered office in the red-brick administration building . hatching one scheme after another to convert Boston State into his vision of the mental hospital of the future ? " a hospital without walls . no longer isolated from the community it serves . but an integral part of that community , drawing strength from the normal community patterns . and using its own special knowledge to keep those patterns healthy . " Beyond this community function , Dr. GreenWatt also visualized Boston State as a great laboratory for the study of all aberrations of the human psyche , a place not primarily custodial , but mainly concerned with developing new treatment techniques that could be applied in any mental hospital in the United States . It was natural therefore that when Commissioner Greenblatt handpicked his successor at Boston State he chose a man highly distinguished in the fields of research and training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amiable chief of the psychopharmacology research branch at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda . Md . Dr. Cole . who masks an energy as fierce as Dr. Greenblatt 's behind a facade of Buddha-like tranquillity , also shares his obsession that the main goal of the mental hospital today is to heal the patient and retui n him as soon as possible into a community educated to accept him . One measure of a hospital 's urge to heal is the number of different programs by which it seeks to create a therapeutic community both within and beyond the hospital walls . At Boston Stale there is such a variety of them that nearly every patient is involved in some sort of hopeful experiment . Moreover , treatment routines were greatly modified after a preliminary study showed that what often disturbed a patient and caused him to become unruly were small annoyances nobody had thought about . Meal hours and bath hours , the use of certain forms of treatment , and restrictions on the patients ' movements were planned for the staff 's convenience , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed patient once was routine , " Dr. Cole says . " When he began acting up , the attendant did n't waste any time on him . He slammed him into a cell and locked him up and left him there . Finally we began to realize that most frequently the patient 's agitation was not due to his basic illness , but to a breakdown of relations between him and staff . Behind nearly every episore of seclusion we found staff errors and staff weakness  --  ignorance , anger . intra-staff feuds , a jailhouse psychology . Knowing this , we reduced seclusion to the vanishing point . " The study of staff-and-patient relationships soon made it obvious that many staff members experienced stresses as severe as those that tortured the patients . Attendants suffered particularly : They stood at the bottom of the hospital pecking order  --  poorly paid , poorly trained and subject to social discrimination if not outright abuse from other staff members . The attendant spent hours with the patients every day . yet the doctors never consulted him about his knowledge of a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a violation of medical ethics to let him know specifically what was wrong with a patient . And . though iL was his duty to protect the ward nurse from violence , he was strictly forbidden to have any social contact with her outside the hospital . In recent years the attendant has been taught that his attitude toward the patients is as much a part of the healing process as the work of the doctor or the nurse . His opinion of his patients ' progress or regression is sought at staff conferences . And if he wants to date a nurse after hours . that 's up to him ? and , of course , to the nurse . When it dawns on the attendant that he is looked on not just as a custodian but as an important member of the treatment team , his morale soars and his effectiveness increases . Some attendants jump at opportunities to work longer and harder with the patients . Some supervise evening activities in their spare time ; others volunteer as guides and drivers , taking patients to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even invited patients home to dinner to meet and socialize with their families . the doctors report . Whenever the doctors at Boston State describe the ideal hospital employee  --  a man with a healing 11.1 manner . was a male nurse at Boston until last year , when the Army Medical Corps commissioned him a lieu- tenant and sent him out to Tokyo , to practice his healing art in the military hospitals where American troops are being treated for psychiatric trauma suffered in Vietnam . Moskovites , a doctor recalled , would go almost wild with joy when a patient with whom he had been working got well enough to he sent home . He would roll up the patient 's mattress and throw it Out the window . He would then tear down the iron bed and throw it after the mattress  --  a symbol that the patient would he fervently hoped ) never need the hospital any more . Shortly before Moskovites left Boston for the Army , he drove me on a tour of the part of the hospital that lies to the east of Morton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half . Piled high against one building  --  mute tribute to John Moskovites 's zeal  --  was a rusting tangle of old iron beds . He parked his little sports car beside a grassy square surrounded by ancient three-story buildings with iron-barred windows . " They 've been empty for months now , " said Moskovites , nodding toward the two largest . " But on hot days you can still smell ' em . " I remarked that the place was as quiet as a country churchyard . " It is quiet now , " said Moskovites , smiling . " but just a few years ago it was bedlam  --  a wild confusion of people yelling and shouting and running around naked . " A whole lot of things brought about the change . Drugs , in the first place . But mainly . I think , alot of tender loving care . That 's trite , I know . But I went over to Harvard and Radcliffe and Tufts and Northeastern and did some talking , and managed to get a lot of good kids to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out at Menninger 's working with disturbed children , Dr. Karl used to tell us , ' Love cures people ? both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it . ' I think that 's what happened here . " The college-volunteer program was started in 1954 , at Metropolitan State Hospital in Waltham , Mass. , by a Harvard student , Larry Dohan . To-day student volunteers work as attendants in more than 100 hospitals and halfway houses around the country . Nearly everywhere such volunteer aid has helped make the difference between success and failure . and Moskovites gave his eager young helpers full credit . In less than five years the population in the old chronic wards under his supervision dropped from 2,000 to less than 200. as the volunteers prepared them to go out to foster homes , nursing homes , or even to their own homes . " We did it just by giving every patient something to do that he could do , " Moskovites explained . " No matter how simple the task might be  --  even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do it bolstered his ego . And we led them along that way , step by step . Not all of them responded , of course . But we did n't give up on anybody . We kept on trying . Come on . " We climbed the stairs of a half-empty building to the locked third floor . Here in a big dayroom women in various stages of undress sat staring blankly at the walls . Two nurses , watching television in the room , got up uneasily , as we came in . " These people are just beginning to make a little progress , " he said . " They ( continued on page 381 arc learning in dress themselves , to inake their own beds . You see there are mirrors on I he walls , and ashtrays , and vases of flowers . 11 means they 're learning not to throw things . This used to be what is called a ' drag ward . ' You had to drag ' em everywhere . Now they 'll usually do what you tell them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the beds were lined up . Suddenly he shouted and began to run . In a corner of the ward a woman lay huddled between the beds . Moskovites ran to her , knelt down beside her , grabbed her arms and began to lift , yelling , " Up ! Up ! . " Please , " she begged . " Please ! Please ! " Moskovites tugged at her , almost manic in his anger  --  not at the whimpering woman , but at the attendants who had failed to notice her . " Get her up , " he shouted , and they lifted her to her feet . Beneath her lay a crumpled dress . She had been on her way to the little ironing room in the corner of the ward to iron a dress  --  the simple task she had been assigned , The nameless horror that besets the schizophrenic had seized her and , unnoticed , she had lain down between the beds , curling into the fetal position , trying to retreat from the terrifying world into the silence and the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arms , led her gently to the ironing board . As they stood beside her , she straightened , looked about and calmly took up the iron . Moskovites smiled and patted her on the shoulder . " Cruel ? " he said . as we left . " No . The cruel thing would have been to let her lie there , which is what we 'd have done in the past . Now I 'll show you a room full of women who were once just as helpless and frightened as she is . " We drove to an old building where 34 women  --  all of them chronic schizophrenics. all of them once absolutely useless to themselves or to society  --  were busy sewing precut blouses on industrial sewing machines . Here , on a project called PROP for Patient Rehabilitation Occupational Program ) . they were earning money while learning a skill . In a few months the more responsive of them would go to a home in the outside world . Nellie , 43 , gray-haired , brown-eyed , was a young and pretty woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( This is not her real name ; fictitious names are used for all patients mentioned in this article . ) When Moskovites began his program of remotivating the chronic schizophrenics , she was foul , filthy and withdrawn . Now she lives outside in a foster home and comes back by day to work in the sheltered workshop . Neither she nor her companions could hold a job except in a " sheltered " situation . Here , though their sewing must meet a certain standard of quality , they can work at their own pace  --  which is about a third that of the normal outside worker . Nellie , in a week , will spend about 34 hours at her machine , and her piecework pay will average 98 cents an hour . The state supports her in the foster home . With her earnings she buys her clothes , cosmetics , cigarettes and other personal items , She goes and comes to the hospital on the bus , by herself . She is not " cured . " There is no known " cure " for schizophrenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FilIFIC111 , she can cope with the routine pall'ruts of normal living . She is a useful person again . She will not die a howling lunatic on the back wards . Katherine , white-haired at 51 , with a smooth , placid face , came to the hospital when she was 22 . Now she , too , was almost ready to leave , but whenever her departure was mentioned she would tremble and begin to whimper . " She 's still a little afraid , " said John Moskovites . " It is a big step . " He put his arm around Katherine , hugged her and patted her cheek . " She has been going out already , buying the little things she will need when she goes to a foster home , " he said . " She went out the other day with Nellie and a staff volunteer . She bought a blue washrag . Nellie bought a pink one . Katherine came right hack afterward , because the crowds scared her . But that 's all right . Now she knows that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can always cone back . " At Boston , with its open gates , there is a constant going and coming of patients . Some go out to work by day and come back to the refuge of the hospital by night . Others sleep in foster homes at night and cone to the day hospital in the morning . In the concept of the therapeutic community , the day hospital is as important as the 24-hour custodial institution . The very fact that it does not provide bed care is one of its great advantages , many doctors believe , for the bed is an invitation to the regressed and frightened patient to withdraw still further into his world of fantasy . There are also patients who are best served by not being brought to the hospital at all . Treatment teams from the hospital  --  a doctor , a nurse and a social worker  --  go to the patients ' homes for periodic calls . These house calls by the psychiatric team were begun under Dr. Greenblatt , on the theory that the visits would give the treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the forces that are destroying him . Under Dr. Cole 's administration , a young social worker , Dr. David Kantor , has pushed the theory one step further . He assigns medical students to live in the home with a discharged patient and his family , thus exposing themselves to the family pressures that the patient himself endures . Even when patients are too sick to live at home , this need not mean the severing of all family ties . Visitors are sometimes startled to see a psychotic mother with her tiny baby in her arms  --  a form of therapy Dr. Greenblatt introduced at Boston State after seeing it tried successfully at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center . " This was a tough decision , " Dr , Greenblatt says . " It is difficult to accept the idea of allowing babies to live in wards with seriously ill adults , whose actions might be unpredictable  --  particularly when the disturbed mother may have hostile feelings toward the child and to her marriage . There were other dangers , too . For instance , would patients get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to hurt it ? " He opened a brown-backed folder . " Let 's take a look at a case and see what happened . " He read : " Mrs. P. , twenty-two years of age . gave birth to a son the day before she received a college degree . This was a bitter disappointment to her because she had wanted to go on to graduate school . It meant that her husband , also a student , and with whom she was fiercely competitive , would continue his studies without her . She rapidly became inadequate as a housewife and mother , lost vitality and became de . pressed and suicidal , and was hospitalized . After two months of therapy she indicated her desire to have the baby with her . and the child was accordingly admitted at age eighteen months . " At first , caring for the child was drudgery. for it was the coming of the child which had caused all this anger and frustration . Once she burst out screaming , ' I hate it ! I hate it ! ' Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother , and she was rewarded repeatedly for her growing confidence in caring for the child . After six months both mother and baby were discharged , with follow-up in the aftercare clinic . " The experiment confirmed what other doctors had discovered  --  that the presence of the baby on the ward tended to bring out the best in the other patients . Most of them welcomed it ; others took its presence as a matter of course . Those who had aggressive feelings stayed away from it . Now it is not unusual to see babies , cheerful and contented , on the wards . Their presence , Greenblatt feels , adds warmth and gentleness to the surroundings . Many patients , less fortunate than Mrs. P. , have been in the hospital so long that they have no family left outside , no home to go to . Others can not go back to their families , for it was the abrasions of family life that sent them to the hospital . Yet they can not live alone . The answer , as Boston State Hospital has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family care , in foster homes chosen by the hospital for their friendly , homelike atmosphere . n Massachusetts , as in other states . I the change in hospital population has followed a curious and somewhat disturbing pattern . While the older patients are moving out , admission records show , more and more young people are coming to the hospital . For example . bed patients 35 to 44 years old  --  the age group in which most of the schizophrenics are found  --  have been decreasing by three percent a year , but at the same time patients under 15 have increased by 16 percent a year . and 15-to-24-year-olds by six percent . Recognizing this new trend , Boston State now lays particular stress on the treatment of the mentally ill adolescent . Under the direction of Dr. Anton 0 . Kris , some 40 to 50 disturbed youngsters 15 to 18 years old are now enrolled in the adolescent program . They live on the wards with adults ? " If you put all your adolescents on the same ward , they 'll tear your hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend their days together , in a program of intensive treatment . Two old buildings left empty by the decrease in adult patients have been renovated with the help of the youngsters themselves into a community house with playrooms , workshops , a lounge and a place to dance . Classes are conducted by teachers from the Boston Public School System , and there is an active program of sports for the young patients . " The main thing we do here , " says Dr. Kris , " is to go deeply into the background of evt , , disturbed child that comes 10 11 , - . i.it1 ) ; 4 ) 1 0111 kids come hum impoyci ished iii tuoken /1011tes. when we have linishiNI our S1114 , WC know the pressui ; mil distractions a youngster has had io endure and , by understandMg him , we are able to teach him to understand himself .

Dick Sullivan . a stocky , amiable student from Northeastern University , recently described his experiences with a schizophrenic 17-year-old named Betty : " One thing about Betty was that she was a terribly strong girl . She got hold of some glass one day and cut up a few of the attendants . She also broke a chair over someone 's head . They tried to tie her down in the ward , but she got loose and ran outside . They finally caught her in the reception building where I was and asked me to help bring her hack . I tried to explain lo her that everything would be OK , but that she had to be good and not try to run away . She was pretty scared , but did what I asked . I found out that if you could calm her down , she was really a sweet kid  --  but no one would take the time with her . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately put her in seclusion , in an empty room with a single window . I remember one of the attendants yelled at me from down the hall , ' Do n't leave that damn girl in here  --  we do n't want her . ' " Some of the attendants really care about the patients . Others . . he shrugged . " It 's definitely not all good here by a long shot . " This of course is true . Despite its effort to recruit humane attendants and enlist the aid of volunteers with the dedication of a Dick Sullivan , Boston State . like every other mental hospital , is still desperately shorthanded . Frequently on the wards at night one young and perhaps very frightened attendant will be looking after 100 patients . Not only because of the multiplicity of its programs but also because Boston State is an open-door hospital , it needs a high staff-to-patient ratio . Many patients who behave very well when they go out in a small group under the supervision of an attendant get in trouble when they go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch her mother in the nose , and then asked her mother to pay for the cab . Another , who was in the hospital for shooting her mother . went home and took a potshot at her father . Men patients , after visiting the nearby taverns , sometimes come back and take a swing at an attendant . Dr. Cole , however , has no intention of locking the gates that his predecessors opened , because he is convinced that the difficulties are more than offset by the good it does a patient to know that he is not imprisoned , that he is free to come and go . There are , of course . a few patients on every ward  --  roughly 200 in the whole hospital  --  who can not be allowed to go out . As soon as additional help becomes available , Dr. Cole will bring these patients together in a special security unit where they will re ceiv ? intensive treatment even though on is restricted . B oston is not unique in what Dr. Cole calls its drive to " jazz things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to stimulate new ideas . " All across the country the same ferment is taking place . New York . Connecticut , California and Massachusetts still lead the nation in the quality of the psychiatric care they provide , but with the help of a great increase in research grants , even the worst states are now showing considerable progress . Thvr ? are still slum ' had hospitals . and some had wards in good hospitals . Across the country , though , the old snakepils are vanishing , as public compassion and concern have their effect on state legislatures . But there are still horrors aplenty. and by a tragic paradox one of the foulest of these , despite desperate efforts to improve . is located in the American city that was once the most humane and progressive in its treatment of the mentally ill .

The 12 distinguished psychiatrists and hospital administrators on the survey team looked into every aspect of By-berry , denounced it as medieval , and recommended as a first step that a topflight psychiatrist and hospital administrator be appointed . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sconfidential report . Located in an industrial section in the northeast corner of Philadelphia , with its 110 red brick buildings scattered over 1,100 acres of trees ? shrubs and well-tended ! awns , it could be the campus of a somewhat shabby New England prep school . At the time of the NIMH survey , however . 6.100 patients were crowded into quarters built for 4,200 . They were tended by 1,800 employees , giving the hospital the lowest staff-to-patient ratio in the state . Of the professional staff . moreover , only 50 were doctors , and only six of these were psychiatrists certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology . Ten others had some training in psychiatry , and there were 85 registered nurses , though this number had decreased to 69 by the time Dr. Blain arrived . As superintendent , Dr. Blain. a tweedy , quiet-spoken , vigorous man of 69 , still faces an uphill battle . Byberry 's inadequacies have been fully publicized  --  most recently an assault of a woman employee , a suicide . and an accidental death in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been more staff supervision . attracted wide attention . But the legislature at Harrisburg has been frugal in its support . When Dr. Blain took over in October of 1966. he made an immediate survey of the hospital 's needs . He asked for 1,739 additional people  --  psychiatrists , psychologists , nurses , therapists , social workers and attendants  --  all of whom he needed desperately . He got 400 attendants . He asked for an operating budget of $25 million . He got $19.7 million . He asked for $33 million in capital funds to build new buildings and to remodel old structures that were falling apart after 18 years of neglect . He got nothing . The shortages in professional staff still exist . Dr. Blain needs 150 psychiatrists . He has 20 doctors working in psychiatry . Only six of them are certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology , and three of these six are administrators who give no therapy . He has 7 clinical psychologists but needs 40 . He has 70 registered nurses but needs 300 . These shortages still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re . port , which said , in effect . that Byberry was a throwback to the snake-pit era .

Due to the shortage of staff . seclusion was used extensively to control agitated patients , and it still is , though under Dr. Blain its use has been much reduced . It is in the detention areas that the lay visitor feels the full impact of what it means to be a patient in a mental hospital . Here there is no furniture  --  just the oilcloth-covered mattress lying on the floor . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the eyes of the patient can be seen . at the little glass- or wire-covered peephole in the door of the tiny seclusion cell . and his voice comes through the locked door as a shrill scream or a mindless babble . When a nurse opened one of these doors , a gray-haired woman was standing there completely nude . The nurse covered her with a blanket . " How long have you been in the hospital . Mary ? " she asked the woman . " Six weeks , " the woman said She has been here ten years ' the nurse said , closing the door . " She could go home if she had anyone to take her Knowing that her family wo n't take her back sets her raving . For her own safety , we have to put her here .

A PoAl researcher , on a visit Io I he hospital a few days after Dr. Blain 's arrival there , gave this description of a . g  --  rial rics ward : " The Ilnng that shook me was the noise . I somehow had n't expected this wild babbling , jabbering , shouting . chattering and mindless moaning . For the first time I understood what the word ' bedlam ' meant . " All around us as we stood in the middle of the room were the old men , bony . withered of body , their skin yellow as parchment . Over the whole place the strong smell of urine hung like a cloud . The noise , the smell , the horrible sight of two old men , stark naked , huddled in their wheelchairs , stunned me . Involuntarily my mind shut out the dreadful scene . I turned desperately to a nurse All I could think to ask was , ' How much do they pay you to work in this place ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a raise not long ago . ' she said . ' Now I get one hundred and twenty-four dollars every two weeks . ' " As I was leaving the ward , a doctor asked if I had seen the old man who huddled in a corner with a sheet over his head . I had n't . But I nad seen the crippled man who came sidling toward me on his hands and knees with a hideous crablike motion , his hands slipping in the filth of the floor , his voice a strange gobbling sound . " The old-women 's ward was even more hideous , for it was their lunchtime and they sat about , some of them stark naked , dipping the soupy food it looked like beans , rice , meatballs and ice cream from their trays with their hands . A few could feed them . selves with a spoon . Two attendants , harassed , impatient , their uniforms smeared with spilled food , were feeding others who spat and struck at the spoon like children " A doctor told me that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . They could have made it very well in the protected surroundings of a nursing home . Here they have gotten worse instead of better . " ' There are two thousand geriatrics cases here out of six thousand , ' the doctor said . ' It 's a case of everybody 's grandma being sent up to the Funny Farm to die . They do n't belong here but in Riverview. the county home for the aged . But when Riverview fills up , some Philadelphia doctor writes on their charts : Chronic brain syndrome with psychosis . When he adds , with psychosis , we have to take them . ' " The tragedy of Byberry is that , with a little money and a little help , many of these living vegetables might long ago have been transformed into human beings again , able to live under sheltered conditions outside . A small rehabilitation unit , functioning under a federal grant , carries on within the hospital itself a program of intensive treatment which in eight years has returned some 800 patients to the community . where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . But , with a hospital population of nearly 5,000 , an average of 100 discharges a year is not much to shout about . Byberry 's routine therapy is now doing about as well . By working his staff people almost beyond their endurance , Dr. Blain in the past 18 months has reduced By-berry 's bed population from 6.100 to 4.850 . He expects to move out another 1.000 to 1,500 in 1968 if federally supported social workers in Philadelphia find places for them in nursing homes . foster homes and geriatrics centers . By concentrating on new patients . the hospital has been able to send them out in three months , on the average , a creditable record . " We have begun to function as a treatment center , not a warehouse , " Dr. Blain said . " But I very much doubt that we can keep up this pace much longer without an increase in staff . The people we have are working twenty percent beyond their capacity . " Also , the patients we have sent out were the easiest ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's like chipping ice with a spoon . Every tinn ? advance . from here on . will come only with tremendous detailed effort : - Shortchanging its mental hospitals is the poorest sort of false economy a state can practice , Dr. Blain feels . " If we had been able to spend thirty-three million dollars to remodel this place , and if we had twenty-five million dollars a year to operate on for two years in a row , we could reduce Byberry 's bed population to three thousand patients or less . When we reached this figure , the budget would begin to decrease . In fact , I would guarantee that I could reduce the budget ten percent a year for live years . " A custodial hospital obviously can be run more cheaply on a day-to-day basis than a treatment hospital , but in the long term it is vastly more expoSiVC .. s as simple as t his , ' ' Dr. says . " Spend twelve to fourteen dol-lar day and get ' em out . Or spend five dollars a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arrival , By-ben y 's per diem has risen from $5.15 to $8.20 ? still far from adequate . Unless the legislature comes through in the next few years with a strong transfusion of new money , Dr. Blain thinks , it is hardly likely that Byberry can improve much further . There is , however , one bright hope for the future . Philadelphia . working mainly with federal funds , has done what he considers the best job in the country of setting up community mental-health centers . Ten are planned , with six in operation now , and they inevitably will take some of the pressure off Byberry . Plans are under way to tie Byberry in with each of these centers , By special arrangement among city , state and federal governments , the centers will pay Byberry for handling patients from their " catchment areas " who need intensive care , and the centers in turn will provide aftercare for the patients Byberry treats and sends out . Dr. Blain does not foresee that under such an arrangement Byberry will revert to its old custodial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said-1,000 for patients in intensive care , 1.000 for patients taking part in an elaborate program of rehabilitation and vocational training . There is the strong possibility that , for all its unhappy history , Philadelphia will , through its mental-health centers , become once again a model for the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill . T he variations in the amounts differ- ent states spend on their mentally ill are fantastic . At the top is Alaska , which last year spent $32.37 per patient per day iwith a total mental-hospital population of less than 250i ; at the bottom is Mississippi , spending $3.99 . Kansas , the District of Columbia , Colorado . Utah . Iowa and California all spent more than $15 . Alabama and West Virginia , along with Mississippi . each provided less than $5 . The national average in 1967 was $8.84 . This is not to say that West Virginians , for example , are naturally less compassionate than Kansans . In nearly every case politics and a shortsighted view of economy are to blame . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclic thing . The pattern is always the same . A new governor comes into office and he calls for a crash program of hospital reform . The legislature catches lire and money is provided , the old superintendent is fired and a new one is hired . He builds up a top-flight professional staff , and all goes well for a few years . The bed population drops , and the papers are full of praise for the new programs . Then a new economy-minded administration comes in . The hospital budget is slashed , and the administrator is forced to cut back on his therapeutic programs . Staff morale is shattered . The admin. istrator and the top people he brought with him scatter like frightened birds -- to states where a new cycle is beginning . It is not a had system for the nation as a whole . Top professional talent in the field of mental health is in extremely short supply , and the recurring cycles help to diffuse it throughout the country . For the states that lose their good people . however . it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote his series on Columbus State Hospital in 1956 , Ohio was just beginning a period of hospital reform . But then in 1963 Gov . James Rhodes . taking over a nearly bankrupt state , announced that he was going to tire all hospital personnel hired by his predecessor after a certain date . He quickly rescinded the order , but the damage had been done . At the first hint of a political pogrom , many experts left Ohio . Early in his term Gov . Ronald Reagan of California spooked many of his top people by announcing that about 3.400 mental-health personnel would be cut from the payroll . Immediately . every hospital administrator in the country , including Dr. Hulusi Tuatay. then superintendent at Columbus State . got on the telephone to California . Dr. Tuatay , a soft-voiced , smiling , deceptively self-effacing man . had been at Columbus State for nearly 10 years before he was made superintendent : and he served only 2 ' 2 years in that capacity before lie was promoted to the staff of the state department of mental hygiene as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his years at the hospital , he was responsible for introducing many of the therapeutic programs that were lacking when John Bartlow Martin visited the hospital in 1956 .

The huge main hospital building is still rundown and shabby , and a doctor making his rounds will INSANE ASYLUM .. vialk two miles from his ( ) Mee to he farthest ward and hack again , Iiul the ivr diem idlowance iin years ago to $6,80 mill nisi rnoulgh , but an improvement , hill urtnrs , 30 of whom are psychiatrists illiuugh only four are Board-certil ? 4I i , ; Ili ' till the staff now compared with including three psychiatrists-12 years ago , and all new patients and half of the long-term chronics are now receiving some fonn of active therapy . There is also an effective program of aftercare . All across the country brilliant and dedicated doctors are using the new developments of the past 10 years  --  the new drugs . the new therapies . the new understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old concepts of how a mental patient should be treated and a mental hospital should be run . These methods , though aimed at the same goals , are often surprisingly dissimilar . At Boston State the attitude is one of solicitude and gentle encouragement , a technique that works well with schizophrenics . At St. Joseph , Mo. , Dr. Liam O'Brien uses methods much less tender to rouse depressed patients from their apathy . He admits that these methods may seem callous , even brutal . to an outsider , but he holds that nearly anything can be done to , or for , a mental patient if the patient recognizes that it is being done in a spirit of love and compassion . " A depressed patient has a deep sense of guilt , " Dr. O'Brien explains . " It may be real or imagined . but at any rate , it 's there . And how do you expiate guilt ? By penance , of course . You make up for your wrongdoing by accepting punishment . Thus , when the depressed person says to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a no-good , ' and the friend says , ' Now , now , that is not true . You are n't a no-good at all . You are a line , sweet person , and we all love you , ' the friend actually makes the person feel worse . not better . " When a patient says to Dr. O'Brien . " I am no good . I do n't deserve sympathy , " he says , " Very well . Take this brush and start scrubbing the floors . " But , he points out , you must do this in a loving , not a sadistic , way . " Depressed people . " he says , " are also very dependent people  --  they go mooning about the house , one side of them saying , ' I 'm no good . ' the other demanding of all those about them , ' Gratify me  --  gratify me ! ' " We help them get rid of their sense of guilt by putting them to scrubbing floors , and we gratify them by praising them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more step  --  though we praise them as they deserve it , we are never quite satisfied , we keep pushing ? ' There 's a bit of dirt there in the corner , there 's a heel mark here ' until they begin to show signs of resentment . Then we set them to work at another task , more in keeping with their background than scrubbing floors . As we push , we watch for the first hopeful signs of hostility , because justified anger is healthy anger . " A young Cuban doctor , using Dr. O'Brien 's " push ' em until they push back " theory , came to Dr. O'Brien 's office looking puzzled . He was not sure he was making progress with a patient , he said . The patient had called him a name . but his English was not good , and he was not sure that this was a manifestation of healthy hostility . " What did he call you ? " asked Dr. O'Brien . " He called me a horse 's ess . " Dr. O'Brien suppressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Please continue . " A thousand miles to the south . at Central State Hospital in Milledgeville , Georgia . a blunt-spoken young psychologist , Dr. Robert Francis Heap , ex-paratrooper and Ranger , is experimenting with even more brusque and demanding techniques for remotivating old schizophrenics . " It is the job of the psychologist , " says Dr. Heap , " to assess and modify human behavior , and all human beings  --  even those who have been judged insane  --  willingly will modify their behavior in ways that pay off for them . " To test this idea , he set up , in an old ward of Milledgeville , what is in effect a small socio-economic community . On Dr. O'Brien 's remotivation wards . when the patient learns to scrub a floor properly , the doctor praises him and immediately sets him a higher task . At Milledgeville , Dr , Heap not only praises him , he pays him . Originally Heap used little wooden tokens sawed from broom handles . Metal slugs have now replaced the wooden currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his bed , food and recreation- everything but medicine , The first 45 " citizens " of Dr. Heap 's experimental community were chosen at random from 90 dull-eyed , foul and unresponsive men living on one of Milledgeville 's most regressed back wards . The remaining 45 served as a control group . They were sent back to a typical chronic ward , there to receive only the routine custodial treatment that is all this desperately shorthanded institution can normally provide . The 45 chosen for the experiment were moved into a special ward , physically as dull and drab as any other , but operated independently of the rest of the hospital . Here they were under the close supervision of a treatment team made up of the psychologist , a medical doctor , a psychiatric nurse , a social worker , a chaplain , and aides specializing in occupational , musical , recreational and vocational therapy . " In the past , " said Dr. Heap . " most of the care and handling of the mental-hospital patient has unwittingly encouraged passive , dependent , abnormal behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of his apathetic acceptance . to make him adaptive , independent , appropriately aggressive in the pursuit of worthwhile goals . " One of Dr. Heap'spatients immediately proved to be " adaptive , independent and aggressive in the pursuit of worthwhile goals. - He got a broom handle and started counterfeiting tokens at such a rate that inflation threatened to wreck the whole project . When the patient first comes to one of Dr. Heap 's token wards  --  there are now live such wards  --  he is issued enough tokens to pay for his meals , his bed and his other needs for two days . After these are gone he must work to earn the tokens to pay for every service he receives . " The patient is taught that he must take full responsibility for his own behavior , " Dr. Heap explained . " 11 he gets up in the morning , makes his own bed , shaves , participates in the morning exercises and shows up for breakfast , clean , neat and calm , he has automatically earned enough tokens to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it is assumed that he does not want to eat . The choice is his . We do n't say , ' If you do n't work , you do n't cal . ' We Iell him , ' I f you want to eat , you iniNt work . ' Thus I he patient must make a decision , and this , in Dr. I leap 's theory , is the beginning of healing , for when the paLiiin I slarts making decisions , he begins to make contact again with the world of reality . So far . Dr. Heap can recall no patient who has chosen to miss more than two meals in a row . To a lay visitor . what Dr. Heap has accomplished in 18 months is impressive . To reach the T tfor token ) wards , the visitor must pass through a typical , old-time asylum dayroom where in the traditional moan and mutter and odor of madness , men sit like vegetables , numbed by drugs , or gabble , laugh and dance as their illness seizes them . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , quiet . well-kept wards . Dr. Heap 's patients move about busily at a dozen tasks as they work to earn their tokens . They have at least curbed the symptoms of their illness . and by controlling their conduct , they come nearer to the day when they can walk out of the hospital door . " No man , " says Dr. Heap . " can help being crazy . He can help ( Kling crazy . " Dr. Heap does not claim his patients are cured when they leave the hospital . No doctor who works with mental patients will use the word " cure " in the absolute sense . But his patients do show a remarkable capacity for keeping themselves under control . for adjusting to life in the world outside . The ward records tell a dramatic story : to date , 251 patients have been treated in the T-wards . Of these , 74 percent improved enough to be sent home , and only 19 percent of those discharged have come back . For the hospital as a whole , the relapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien , Kris , Heap , by Mr. Moskovites and others experimenting with new approaches , will in time alter the pattern of patient population . Schizophrenics , with their withdrawal from reality , their inner fantasies , their delusions , hallucinations and bizarre posturings. now make up 20 percent of all the new admissions to mental hospitals and 30 percent of the readmissions . They are usually young  --  their average age is 34 ? and comparatively healthy . As a result , their death rate is low , and they tend to accumulate . Today , therefore , while half the beds in all U.S. hospitals are occupied by mental patients , half the beds in mental hospitals are occupied by schizophrenics . The next largest segment of mental-hospital admissions is composed of patients suffering from such ailments as cerebral arteriosclerosis and senile brain disease . Their death rate is high , but their release rate is so low that they . too , tend to accumulate . They account for nearly one fifth of the present mental-hospital population . Many of these patients should never have been sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little that the psychiatrist or the psychologist can do for them . They need a medical doctor . a nurse and , above all , a friend . At huge Colorado State Hospital on the edge of the arid plain outside Pueblo , the senile patient may find all three of these in the person of one man . Dr. Augustus Davison is a short , tweedy , pipe-smoking man with steel-gray hair and sharp blue eyes . a harsh-voiced sentimentalist with a brusque manner , and l talent for handling the trou. ' nu and cantankerous oldster . Dr. Day Ison is an M.D .. Rill a psychiatrisi or isychologist he is et ends not even to understand their language . " Whit do you mean by ' psychiatric treatment ' ? " he asks . " I do n't know-unless it 's a patient under the influence of Sodium Pentothal , lying on a couch dredging up memories of his childhood while a doctor listens and a tape recorder takes it all clown . So , let us take a look at one of our geriatrics patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with swollen feet , a failing heart and an inability to control his bladder plus . perhaps , a schizophrenic reaction of forty years ' duration . What can a psychiatrist do fur him ? Nothing . The psychiatrist wants to treat a person perfect in health except for a touch of schizophrenia . He takes one look at my old guy and surrenders . " Ten , fifteen years ago. - Dr. Davison says , " I felt that way myself . I had the feeling that a geriatrics patient was hardly worth fooling with  --  no mind . no hope , no future , and a feeble body that was really no challenge to the doctor . " Then . for some reason maybe as I , myself . grew older  --  I began to understand that a day in an old man 's life is as important as a day in the life of a child . and that there must be depth and breadth to life , as well as length of days . So , the challenge was there  --  to the doctor and the nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senile old  --  to bring some beauty , some joy , some usefulness back into the lives of these people who have , in effect , simply been stowed away to die . " Dr. Davison starts by trying to make his patients physically comfortable . " Some of them come in here as bedfast patients , " he says , " complete with bedsores and catheters . I say to a man like that , ' Mr. Johnson . would n't you like this damned catheter pulled out of you so you can get up and try a walker . or a wheelchair , or get some strength hack in your legs and arms ? Would n't you like to try to put your own clothes on , and would n't You feel better getting up and going to the table with the others ? ' We let him know by our words and actions that we think he can do these things . And he does try . So , out of three hundred and ninety patients in our geriatrics division  --  and they range in age from sixty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bedfast . There is not a catheter in a single patient . I take a very dim view of any institution which resorts to this scurvy trick to keep the sheets dry . " Once his patients are made comfortable with the drugs and medicines that will alleviate their physical ailments , 1 h Davison it ies to lied whatever hidden reserves of strength Lhey may have left . " We lay nut programs for I Ilan in group therapy , in occupational I herapy of various kinds , " he says . " We keep them busy doing something that we hope they like to do . Every night there 's something  --  church , movies , a party , a dance . We let them cook and serve their own meals . " I know of no patient who can not , if he tries , do something useful for himself , or for those about him , " he explains . " The aged patients come in here with a great feeling of uselessness . They have a great wish to isolate themselves ; they hope they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is natural and normal for people who have been busy all their lives to find it difficult to adjust when their working days are over . But we let them know that we think elderly people ought to be able to take things a little easier , to withdraw from responsibility , from crowds and rush and hurry . They have a right to a gentle disengagement from life . " Then we try to create in them the feeling that ta'y are stiff needed , are useful to Ludy. that they are entitled to I and respect . And when they are cast in I.he role of a needed , useful , respected person , they rise to the occasion . " In 1961 , when Colorado State formed its Geriatrics Release Program , there were 2,400 patients at the hospital who were past the age of 65 . By the end of 1967 there were 390 . Dr. Davison , who came to Colorado Stale in 1965. modestly says that his only contribution was fighting to bring medical care " to a level good enough for my relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boston  --  all are relics of the past insofar as physical plant is concerned , although using modern techniques . North of Pueblo , in Denver , lies Fort Logan . a shining new prototype of the mental hospital of the future . Only its spacious tree-shaded lawns bring to mind the classic asylums of the past . New one-story buildings of glass and steel , with no bars at the windows , are scattered in clusters of " family units " around courtyards bright with flowers . In these sep arate cottages the mentally ill of all ages and both sexes live on wards separated only by a common dayroom . With a staff of 720 employees and 1,336 patients  --  only 198 of whom are on 24-hour care  --  Fort Logan is one of the most heavily staffed slate hospitals in the country . Even so . it makes much use of the patients themselves , and it allows them to know what illness afflicts their fellows .

Trusted patients are used to guide those still needing help to the various therapy areas . The older people , particularly , help each other ; it is a common and touching sight to see them walking together  --  old men , old women or old couples  --  hand in hand like children . A conversation I recently overheard between an older woman , very nearly ready to graduate to day-hospital care , and a younger woman . bovine and withdrawn and still hallucinating , reveals how one patient may help another . OLDER WOMAN : My voices are gone . I do n't hear them any more . Do you ? YOUNGER WOMAN : Yes . And I am glad . OLDER WOMAN : Why ? YOUNGER WOMAN : Because I like them . They keep me company . OLDER WOMAN : Yes . but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them any more . At Fort Logan , built and organized in 1961 in keeping with recommendations of the Joint Commission on Mental Health , there is a wide range of facilities for therapy  --  everything from basket weaving and basketball to the soul-searching agony of the psychodrama. in which the patient is induced to re-create , in dramatic form , the situations that drove him mad . There are no seclusion rooms . There are no restraints other than the sedative effect of drugs . and these are administered sparingly . The treatment team may consist of as many as 21 people , including a psychiatrist , a psychologist , two social workers , nurses , and occupational and recreational therapists . Each team will be responsible for approximately 100 patients , about half of whom the team will see and work with every day .

You want my money . " 51w clawed with long fingernails at the doctor 's eyes . A nurse came to help , and the two of them led her away , still screaming . Her story . when it came out . revealed her as typical of the lonely old . Her husband , a successful businessman , had died years before . leaving her fairly well off . For a while she had lived well and pleasantly in her own apartment . then in a boardinghouse of the better class .

Though this was not true , she began a series of moves . from one cheap boardinghouse to another one cheaper stilt . When the police finally brought her to the hospital , she had been living in a tiny room in a Denver slum . going out at night to ransack garbage cans for her food . Later that same day I saw her again . She was clean and quiet . under sedation . Her hair had been combed. and there was a ribbon in it . She was sitting in a chair with a restraining table , which prevented her from getting up . though she was free to move her legs and arms . Her eves were glassy and unfocusing. but contact had been made . The woman doctor she had fought that morning stood beside her . When the doctor started to move away , a bird-claw hand reached out . " Do n't leave me , " the woman croaked . Two days later , still in the chair , but under leas heavy sedation , she took part in a group-therapy session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of patients back to contact with their surroundings by passing around objects of various shapes and textures . For the women , there were bits of cloth  --  a bright print , a rough grained corduroy. a lush , soft piece of crimson velvet . As they put the velvet on the old woman 's lap , her hands . all blue veins and bone , reached down to touch it . Her fingers caressed its softness , and in the drug-dimmed eyes there seemed to flicker a gleam of light . " Maria likes the pretty velvet . " the therapist said . The group sat silent . watching or dozing or staring blankly at something else . The toothless lips moved , and the neck muscles jerked with the effort of speech . The voice came harsh as a parrot 's squawk ? " I ... had . . dress . . like ... this .... " A psychiatrist , watching . smiled . The old woman . wild with terror a few days before . was coming back to contact with reality . Her prognosis : pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicating as well as her deafness allowed . In time she would go out to a nursing home . Would she return to the hospital ? Would the old fears come back , that people were trying to rob her , that she would die a pauper ? Perhaps . That is the risk an open-door hospital must lake- that it may send some patient out before he is ready . " Every time we let one go out , we know we are taking a gamble , " said Don Snapp , administrative assistant to Fort Logan 's director . " It really shakes up a team when it judges wrong and sends somebody out too soon . You see them leave , full of hope , strength and confidence  --  and you feel there 's no job in the world as rewarding as this . And then you see them come hack in , filthy . screaming and cursing , or dull-eyed , wooden , withdrawn . It breaks your heart . But you have to give them their chance , even if nearly a third of them do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The effort to get people out of the hospital and into the community is now being matched , in some areas . by a determination not to admit them in the first place unless they clearly require the special facilities of a mental hospital For four years  --  until his recent assignment to other judicial duties  --  Judge Joseph Karesh of the San Francisco Superior Court stood as a watch-clog between the patient and the mental hospital . A chunky , owlish , soft-spoken ex-South Carolinian with a crew cut , Judge Karesh was appointed Judge of the Psychiatric Court in 1963 . " At that time , " he says , " the judge held his hearings in the ward at the county hospital . The poor sick people stood there in their pajamas while the doctor read the record to the judge . Whatever the doctor recommended , the judge so ordered , and nearly every time the order was a commitment to the asylum . The people being sent away did n't have any idea what was happening to them . Sometimes they did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or why I was asking all those questions . The first hearing I held , a patient socked me in the jaw . " Once during a visit by Judge Karesh 's father , a rabbi from Charleston . the judge took him along to watch the commitment process . " One of the patients to come before me was an old , old man , " the judge says . " I remember now how pitiful he looked standing there , barefooted , in that old , blue-denim robe . After the hearing , my father did n't say much . But not long after that . he had to go to a hospital himself . for an operation . He was 83 , and when I went to see him there , he called me to his bed . When I bent over him . he whispered . ' Son , what happened to that old man ? ' " I realized then what a dreadful thing we were doing . I refused to go on the wards any more . I had a courtroom set up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . And I said that when a patient was brought to me he was to be dressed . He was to have with him any witnesses he wanted . and a lawyer if he wanted one . I wanted him to know that , crazy or not , he was entitled to his day in court . " I remember a guy they picked up downtown raising hell , and his record showed he had ' been in Napa ' site of a big state hospital ) and that he was ' under the delusion ' that he was the manager of a prosperous business . " Welt , a little questioning showed he had ' been in Napa , ' but not in the hospital . He lived there . And he manago ' husiness there . Ile Was n't , just drunk , but he came within al , : net ' of being committed . " There is no danger that patients who get their day in a court like Judge Karesh 's will be committed by accident . The judge listens to the doctor and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought before him . " ' You need to understand what 's going on , " he says . " You 'll Iind a woman trying to get her husband committed just to get rid of him , and vice versa . You 'll find parents trying to get the courts to put away an unruly child . And you 'll find children trying to turn the state into a baby-sitter for their aged and dependent parents . " You do n't have to be a psychiatrist to understand people . " said the judge . " I know I take a terrific gamble sometimes , when I refuse to commit . I 'll tell you this , though : If a man says he 's afraid he 's going to hurt somebody , I take his word , not the doctor 's . " On the " bench " in his little improvised courtroom at the hospital the judge 's manner was infinitely gentle . A little black-haired woman , neatly dressed , came in on the arm of her father . a short , red-faced , well-groomed man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride away . She seemed to be in her late or middle 30 's , but there was something childlike about her . The record showed that she had been picked up late at night . barefooted , banging on the doors of St. Cecilia 's church . She realized she needed help . her father said , and wanted to be committed voluntarily  --  meaning that she could leave the hospital after seven days , whether or not the hospital felt she was ready to go . " I wonder , " the judge said musingly , almost to himself , " if she has the capacity to make that decision . " " I have every capacity , " she said . " You want me to tell you where I first met you ? You were on the corner dispatching cabs . I know everybody . I know all the saints by name , all the fallen angels , all the good angels . " The judge glanced down at the paper in front of him . " Your name is Barbara , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little woman said . " It also means ' strange . ' " She grabbed her father 's hand and kissed it . " I am a strange , blessed child . I want to go home now , to my mother . " " Her mother is dead , Judge , " her father said quietly . " You go out in the hall and talk to your father for a minute , " the judge said . She went out with the little man . leaning on his arm . The judge shook his head . " I 'll have to commit her , " he said sadly . One after the other , the pitiful parade passed before Judge Karesh , 14 in all . Two patients were too ill to be brought into court . The judge went to them on the ward . One . an old woman with white hair turned stiff and yellow , was trying to draw a ragged stocking over a swollen , blue-veined foot . " I 'll get ready , I 'll get ready , " she kept saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the nurse . " She does n't need a hospital . She needs a nursing home . Then the judge went out . " The pitiful thing , " he said . " is their helpless-ness , their utter helplessness .... Americans have not always shown this deep concern for the " utter helplessness " of the mentally ill . Colonial America hiought hum Europe the false belief that insanity is incurable except by bleeding , beating , blistering and purging the patient to make the evil . spirit that possessed him so un-comlortable it would go away . There was no attempt at gentler therapy . The wealthy insane were kept locked up in barns or attics by their families ; the poor were left to loam the roads . harried from town to town like dangerous beasts , or were shut away in almshouses , or simply put in jail . This attitude began to change in the early days of the Republic , again following the lead of Europe . In 1792 Dr. Phillipe Pinel unchained the madmen in the asylums of Paris . In England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Retreat . where insane patients were housed in a family environment and treated as guests . No harsh treatment of any kind was permitted , except the occasional use of a straitjacket or seclusion , to control a manic patient . America for a time adopted and improved upon these humane methods , but the era of loving-kindness did not last long . A fiercely competitive industrial America soon forgot what a pastoral and rural America had discovered . Recognition of the madman as a human being had led to the building of the huge old asylums that still stand by the score all across the country . Their original purpose was to restore the mentally ill to health by compassionate and understanding treatment , but under the pressures of an increasingly complex and materialistic society , this goal was abandoned . The asylums became vast warehouses where the insane , the senile , the brain-damaged and the retarded were hidden away together and forgotten . In the past decade or so we have started to realize again that the mentally ill person is a human being , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any one of us . This realization , coupled with new therapeutic techniques , has brought a long-absent hope to those so afflicted  --  not everywhere . by any means , and not in every case , but more and more widely , more and more often . Today hospital people estimate that one third of the nation 's mentally ill. including nearly all those admitted to the hospital for the first time . are receiving good-to-excellent care . Of the remainder  --  the older , more difficult cases  --  about a third are getting moderately good care . The others , nearly half of the total , are still getting nothing much except token therapy and perhaps a somewhat more compassionate form of custodial care . We have come a long way in the years since John Bartlow Martin wrote his classic INSIDE THE ASYLUM . There is still a long way to go . In 1956 , when a doctor walked through the wards and a patient grabbed his arm , and , pleading . asked , " Doctor , when can I go home ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a lie . Today he can truthfully say it to thousands of patients , for , in the words of Dr. Charles E. Meredith at Pueblo . " Tomorrow comes more often now . " But until we can hold out that hope to all those still hidden away in all the mental hospitals of the nation , the job is not finished . Until it is , each of us must bear in shame a share of the guilt .
