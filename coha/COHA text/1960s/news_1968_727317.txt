txt From the tarpaper shanties on the hillsides of Los Laches , the poorest of Bogota 's 105 parisles. the splendid pomp of the 39th International Eucharistic Congress seems remote and alien .

Well beyond the last of the city 's paved streets , the people of Los Laches have a spectacular view of the capital . From their heights , they look out across the red tile roofs and church spires of the old city to the new skyscrapers and boulevards that end in El Dorado Airport , where a jet airliner will bring Pope Paul VI here from Rome on Thursday .

The cathedral was reopened Thursday , the Feast of the Assumption , with an elegant high mass celebrated by 45 priests led by the Most Rev. Anibal Munoz Duque , Archbishop of Bogota . Knights of the Holy Sepulcher , a laymen 's order of medieval origin , formed before the altar wearing white robes embossed with a red cross . New Church Unfinished Father Jimenez has been trying to build a new brick church and parish house behind the wattle shelter . The church walls are half finished , the floor is dirt , and only one corner , where the altar is set up on a wooden table , is covered by corrugated roofing sheets . Two brass bells mounted on a eucalyptus pole chimed Thursday morning calling worshipers in Los Laches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dark shawls , straggled in from the tog-covered hillside pathways .

" The curia is  --  broke with this congress and these people just do n't have the money to pay for a church , " Father Jimenez said . " Many can barely eat . " At the parish house each weekday , Mrs. Albertina , Father Jimenez 's housekeeper , prepares kettles of soup , loaves of bread and bowls of milk for 150 neighborhood children . Their mothers work in the city , or they come from indigent families . The food is prepared from sacks of wheat flour , cans of powdered milk and tins of margarine that come to Colombia as gifts from the United States through Caritas , the Catholic international charity agency . As the children filed in , they gave their names and were checked off on a list by Sister Esperanza , a voung Colombian nun . " The people here do n't know about the pill , " said Father Jimenez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a radical . He wants to build a parish in a deprived community where he said the people " are one step from Communism . " " But if you go to the curia and talk about social action they say you are a revolutionary , " he said . " They just do n't want to see what conditions are like up here . " " I wish some of the pilgrims coming for the Pope 's visit would stay with us and see what life is really like here , " Father Jimenez continued . " We asked the organizers of the congress to send us some pilgrims , but they said it was too dirty and unsafe here . " Los Laches and the other shanty districts of El Rocio , El Consuelo and El Dorado , which make up the parish , have been formed by successive waves of families fleeing the high rents of the city and the political violence in Colombia 's rural areas and by individuals fleeing the police .

" If you ask why the personnel does n't come , the answer to everything here is wait , " said Sister Esperanza . Eleven men and a woman were digging together the trenches for the foundations of new homes under the housing program . Houses Being Built Hector Zambrano , a darkhaired young man in a yellow shirt , rested a moment from swinging a pick . He works in the city as a bill collector and is building the new home for his wife and two children .
