A British judge may never again place a black cap upon his bewigged head and solemnly tell a prisoner that " the sentence of this court upon you is that you suffer death in the manner authorized by the law , and may the Lord have mercy on your soul ! " The abolition of the death penalty was carried in the House of Commons last week by a vote of 355 to 170. *The bill was a " private member 's motion , " introduced by Pacifist Sydney Silverman , 69 , a Labor M.P . who has fought against the gallows for nearly 30 years . The Conservative Party in the past has opposed abolition , but much support for the bill came from such Tory chiefs as Iain Macleod , Sir Derek Walker-Smith and ex-Home Secretary Henry Brooke . And the voting was " free . " M.P.s voted at the urging of their conscience , not as their party dictated . <P> Absurd Contradictions . The vote completed the work begun in the Homicide Act of 1957 , which defined only certain types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most other types . Thus a man could still be hanged if he stole from as well as killed his victim , or if he killed a policeman or a prison official , or more than one person , but not for other forms of murder . This resulted in ab surd situations where a killer who slew little children got away with imprisonment ; yet if he took as little as a shilling from his victims , he was hanged . <P> " Executions are so much part of British history , " said Viscount Templewood , a Cabinet minister of the 1930s , " that it is almost impossible for many excellent people to think of the future without them . " As late as the mid-19th century , when an Englishman could be hanged for 200 different offenses , most of them trivial , 20 or more persons were dispatched at once , and vast festive crowds turned out for the " hanging days " at Tyburn . In recent years , a steady campaign against the death penalty has been fought by lawyers and authors , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handbook on Hanging to " The Hangmen of England and Similar Constitutional Bulwarks Everywhere . " <P> Among the present cases that troubled the public conscience was the grisly one of Timothy Evans , who in 1950 was accused of killing his wife and daughter and was executed , although in court he named Prosecution Witness John Chris tie as the guilty man . Three years later , Christie was revealed as the slayer of six women , and a month before his own execution , he confessed to the murder of Evans ' wife . <P> <P> Limited Time . Once Britain abolishes the death penalty , only two countries in Western Europe-France and Spain-will still retain capital punishment . None of the other abolition countries have faced a sharp rise in the incidence of murder , which suggests to the abolitionists that the death penalty never acted as a notable deterrent . Even so , Tory Henry Brooke urged that the bill , if it became an act , should be brought before both Houses of Parliament again in five years ' time , adding , " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right course to take . " When the House comes to examine the bill in committee , it may well be amended on the lines suggested by Brooke . <P>
