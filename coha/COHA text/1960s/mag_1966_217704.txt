THE UNMAKING OF A MAYOR by William F. Buckley Jr . 341 pages . Viking . $6.95 . <P> <P> The unmaking had its unbeginning when elegantly eloquent Conservative William F. Buckley Jr . got to thinking seriously about one of his " semi-jocular " newspaper columns , in which he had " vouchsafed a paradigmatic platform , theoretically useful in any large-size American city . " From there , it was no more than a few thousand syllables into the 1965 New York mayoralty campaign as the Conservative Party contestant against Republican-Liberal John V. Lindsay and Democrat Abraham Beame . <P> " There never was , " writes Buckley , " a less deliberated , less connived at , less complicated entry into any political race . " He was under no illusions . A spoiler redeemed by a sense of humor about the political grotesqueries of New York-and , happily , about himself as well-Buckley merely set out to give his lumps to all comers , notably Lindsay , whose campaign Buckley characterizes as " sheer , utter , hopeless , humorless , philistine fatuity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes-not bad for a gadfly . <P> Although he writes at yawnful length about real and imagined distortions of his positions as carried in the press , and at even greater length about what those positions really were , the charm of this book lies in Buckley 's unfailing awareness of the absurdities of campaign rhetoric and rigmarole . He recalls that during televised debates , Lindsay carefully arranged in front of him vast numbers of index cards " on which were graven in Magic Marker salient points or statistics . " Admits Buckley : " I had a mad impulse , one time when he went off to pose for a picture , to scramble the cards around , or maybe doctor the statistics just a little , horrible bit . " Buckley also recalls envying candidates who could " manage a warming half-smile " for the audience when the panel moderator introduced them . He himself had practiced the smile at home , but " I completely spoiled the intended effect of a sort of reserved benevolence by breaking out in a disconcerting sea of teeth . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the political wonderland he had wrought , he was bemused by the thought that he had " really and truly become a politician-and how would I formulate that sin at my next session with my confessor ? " Given the entertainment with which he enlivened New York 's 1965 campaign , Buckley should probably be assigned no greater penance than reading his own book-twice.
