A SCANT decade ago , man was making his first tentative probes into near space . Now , his eye fixed on the moon , that cold and lifeless globe with its borrowed light , he was poised to soar beyond earth 's atmosphere , beyond the 40,000-mile-deep magnetosphere and into a vast and trackless void . The moon flight was man 's first great extraterrestrial venture . <P> The flight began flawlessly . On Pad 39A at Cape Kennedy , Fla. , Borman , Lovell and Anders lay strapped in the 11-ft. command module that was perched atop a 363-ft . Saturn 5 rocket . With a deafening bellow , the rocket inched upward on a rising pillar of smoke and flame , then spurted off into earth orbit . During its second turn around the planet , it accelerated from 17,400 m.p.h. to 24,200 m.p.h. , enough to escape earth 's gravitational embrace and send Apollo 8 on the road of night that would lead to the moon . Almost 69 hours after liftoff , the three astronauts made their historic rendezvous . <P> Below them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pock-marked landscape . In the black sky above hung a half-disk - the earth-its blue and brown surface mottled by large patches of white . Thus , incredibly , they were there , precisely where the mission planners had predicted , finally living the dreams of untold generations of their ancestors . In orbit around the moon and 230,000 miles farther away from home than any humans had ever before traveled , the Apollo 8 astronauts conveyed impressions of their pioneering adventure with words that at times were poetic . Their telecasts gave earthbound viewers an unforgettable astronaut's-eye view of the moon . <P> " The moon is essentially grey , no color , " Astronaut Lovell reported . " Looks like plaster of paris , or sort of a greyish deep sand . We can see quite a bit of detail . The Sea of Fertility does n't stand out as well here as it does on earth . There 's not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters . The craters are all rounded off . The round ones look like they 've been hit by meteorites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge crater . It 's got a central cone to it . The walls of the crater are terraced , about six or seven terraces on the way down . " <P> From their descriptions , it was obvious that the Apollo crew had diligently learned its lessons . The astronauts casually called out names of lunar craters and other landmarks as if they were old friends . The Sea of Fertility . Messier . Pickering . The Pyrenees Mountains . The craters of Colombo and Gutenberg . The long parallel cracks or faults of Gaudibert . <P> <P> What They Saw <P> On Christmas Eve , during their ninth revolution of the moon , the astronauts presented their best description of the moon in the longest and most impressive of the mission 's six telecasts . " This is Apollo 8 coming to you live from the moon , " reported Borman , focusing the TV camera on the lunar surface drifting by below . " The moon is a different thing to each of us , " said Borman . " My own impression is that it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks rather like clouds and clouds of pumice stone . It certainly would not appear to be a very inviting place to live or work . "
