DeLury , be released in the sheriff 's custody to participate in contract talks with the city . Paul O'Dwyer , a lawyer representing the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association , had applied for Mr. DeLury 's release from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily , following a resumption Of negotiations yesterday in the tangled sanitation dispute . The resumption of the contract talks came after . legislative leaders postponed action on Governor Rockefeller 's plan for a temporary state take-over of the Sanitation Department to give Mayor Lindsay time to settle the dispute himself legislature Adjourns In ' Albany yesterday , the Legislature adjourned for the week without acting on the Governor 's plan . Striking sanitationmen returned V ) their jobs last Saturday night with the expectation th4t the Governor 's plan would be , adopted and that they would be paid at : a ratelreCommendeil by a special mediation panel , accepted by the union but rejected by Mayor Lindsay . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. O'Dwyct said it was " extremely difficult " to conduct negotiations without : the union president , whom he called the most knowledgeable union official involved in the current dispute . Frederic S. Nathan , first assistant corporation counsel of the city , opposed Mr. DeLury 'S release . The union leader is serving a 15-day sentence for contempt ' of court for having defied an order to halt the nine-day strike of sanitationmen . Mr. Nathan said that if Mr. DeLury were let . out of Civil Jail , where he is imprisoned , it would be a " travesty on his jail sentence . " " The primary consideration is respect for law , particularly the orders of this court , " he , asserted . Justice Streit , in making his ruling in his chambers , said:1 // " We are talking about a man who has been found guilty of willful contempt of the mandates of this court . I go along with the city that it would be a travesty to bring him out . " The judge did say , however , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer up to midnight each day , and also to make and to receive an unlimited number of telephone calls . Twice before , and without opposition by the city , Mr. DeLury was released from jail on orders by Justice Streit to attend a futile settlement effort in the office of Governor Rockefeller , and to attend a court hearing at which the union was fined $80,000 and lost its dues checkoff system for 18 months . A press spokesman for Mayor Lindsay was asked whether the city would seek any reduction in the penalties , inasmuch as the sanitationmen have returned to their jobs . He replied that he had seen " no evidence " that such a request was planned . Mr. O'Dwyer said that the denial of the application for the release of Mr. DeLury left the union in an awkward position , but that he and union officials would do the best they could to continue negotiations , which were scheduled to continue today . Envisions Trip to Jail " Any serious proposal that conies during negotiations will require me to take time out and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. O'Dwyer said . The union and the city resumed negotiations yesterday morning in the offices of Herbert L. Haber , Director of Labor Relations . Deputy Mayor Robert W. Sweet , also represented the city , and Mr. O'Dwyer and Jack Bigel , a pension consultant , represented the sanitationmen . Neither side would discuss the substance of their discus , sions when the negotiators re : cessed at 2 P.M. There was speculation that they were seek ' ing a new formula , perhaps through a contract longer than a year . Mayor Lindsay , in an interview on his flight back from ' Buffalo , where he spoke Tuesday night , had suggested thel possibility of a longer contract . He said that was the only way to get stability in relations with the sanitation union . Contracts of the sanitationmen have been for one year , ' but in earlier negotiations the city sought to extend the new pact to 15 months , to Sept. 30 of this year . The old contract expired June 30 , 1967 . The special mediation panel set up by Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pay increase of $425 per Year retroactive to July I. 1967 ; double time for Sunday work , retroactive to the same date : double time for work on scheduled days off ; during the week , and deferral of an additional pension contribution . The city had previously agreed to pay the additional sum from April 1 of this year to July 1 . The deferral , the mediators said , would save the city 850 a man in the current year . The starting pay under the lold contract was 56,624 per year , with an increase to a maximum of ** after three years . Prior to the strike , two mediators had recommended a settlement based on a wage increase of 5300 , retroactive to July 1 , 1967 ; an additional $100 , retroactive to Jan. 1 , 1968 , the : city 's pickup of the additional pension contribution ( costing ) S50 for three months ) on April I of this year ; double time for Sunday work retroactive to July 1 , 1967 , and payment for , work on scheduled weekdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of double time . The proposed contract was for 15 ' months . This plan was accepted by the union officers , but turned down by shop stewards and the membership . The city would have accepted the plan if the union had done so . Previously , the city had agreed to an additional $30 contributlon for dental benefits : a payment of S196 more to the annuity fund , retroactive to July 1 , 1967 , in addition to $65 that had been made effective on April 1 , 1967 . ' In addition , the city had agreed in 1966 to put into effect as of July I , 1967 , a pension program that would permit a sanitationman to retire at half-pay after 20 years of service . The cost , estimated at $275 a year for the city , was to be picked up in the new contract . The total cost of the package that was rejected by the union ? outside of double-time payments  --  would have been 8901 for the year . This would include the initial year 's cost of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the proposal of the special mediators would have been $25 more per man for the year , in view of the proposed elimination of the S50 pension cost in the current year .

Their contract ' is for 27 months , expiring on ! 0 Sept. 30 of this year . The starting salary for patrol- ; men and firemen is 57.932 .. After three years this rises toy 89,383 . City officials have contended : that the pay increase recom ; mended by the special mediation panel would upset the tra-1 ditional relationships between ' , the police and firemen and the ! sanitationmen .

They can be expected to seek to reverse this trend in their own negotiations . Cutback in Overtime A " generally favorable " situation in most parts of the city led to a cutback in overtime operations at the Sanitation Department for the first time yesterday since the strike ended , according to Maurice Feldman , acting Sanitation Commissioner . All of the city 's 10,000 sanitationmen have been working three hours of overtime on top of their regular eight-hour daily schedules since the strike ended . Yesterday only half the force was asked to work overtime . Mr. Feldman , said that the cleanup had been progressing satisfactorily and that the overtime cutback had been made out of a " desire not to exhaust the men who have been putting in long , arduous hours in extremes of weather . " " With weeks of winter weather ahead . " he said , " we ca n't risk attrition which can arise from protracted wear and tear on men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
