It was my good luck to serve as a police officer and  --  as a reporter once said  --  a kind of chaperon on the campus of Yale University for almost four decades , during which I witnessed from a ringside scat the high knits , the heartbreaks , the triumphs and the higher education of thousands of young Americans . Before my retirement in 1960 I was often asked to write about my experiences . I do so now only in the hope that what I saw from the inside will help parents everywhere to avoid the mistakes that can wreck a student 's future at that critical time when he is struggling to become a mature adult with an identity of his own . To put it briefly , far too often the most difficult problem on any campus is not the education of the students , but the educating of parents to the fact that they should not try to run or dominate their children 's lives . I 'm not going to preach a sermon . But I 've watched so many fine youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stutz Bearcat roadsters in the 1920 's to the atomic age of the 1950 's that I know from personal experience  --  as I will make clear later  --  the dangers of the " parent problem . " Before going into that , however , I want to say that after thirty-eight years as a campus cop , I believe today 's students are far more serious and work much harder than those of a generation or so ago . Competition is stiffer , and our campus populations generally are more able intellectually . Students drink less than during the days of prohibition , when there were campus bootleggers and organized booze parties at which some youngsters seemed to feel duty bound to guzzle everything they could lay their hands on . And today most students have less to spend than did those of the zany and reckless 1920 's . But I would not want parents to assume that , as a result , there are no longer any campus disciplinary problems . Far from it . Like every other college , Yale has to contend with the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violating rules such as those pertaining to hours in which f , - minine guests may visit dormitory rooms . These rules , incidentally , have been enforced with special vigor since an unhappy incident in 1960 that led to the expulsion of twenty-one students from the university . Another problem common to all colleges is the phenomenon known as a student riot . Such disorders take many different forms and are almost impossible to foresee because they usually grow out of some completely inconsequential incident . A Yale melee in 1952 , for example , started with a trivial argument between two campus ice-cream vendors . But such situations can unpredictably get out of hand in a flash when , on a fine spring day , hundreds of young men suddenly decide to blow off steam after a long period of hard , grinding study . In this instance some 1500 students disrupted the entire New Haven business center and battled Ion police and a fire company for an hour before they were driven back behind the campus fences . It was only later when the excitement had ended and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fun " had not been worth the price of expulsion from college . Such disorders , of course , arc senseless and indefensible . But . in general , there is nothing mean or vicious about most student high jinks , and I feel that we would be in a sorry state indeed if our young men did n't have the ability to laugh occasionally at themselves and their elders and to blow off steam in ways not always approved by college authorities . Now , why do they go out of control at unexpected moments ? I 've often tried to solve that puzzle in my own mind and I 've discussed it with numerous psychologists . I do n't believe there is any single answer , but , at the same time , there arc various factors and combinations of factors that help explain the phenomenon . On almost any campus today students work harder than they did a generation or so ago and they work in a highly competitive atmosphere . All through the often gloomy winter months they are under steadily increasing pressure . Sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of the college on their backs and resent the authority of the college over them . In addition , they are living in a kind of closed academic society that tends to cut them off from the world , and social pressures inevitably build up . Then comes a fine , warm spring day that stirs the sap in the trees and arouses in youngmen an intense urge to action . That 's when both the campus police and the city police put up their guard and prepare for trouble . Sometimes , psychologists explain , the students are inclined to transfer their resentment against the authority of the college to resentment of the police  --  and the result is a senseless and , for some , a tragic riot . I also believe that it is important for parents to understand that today their sons are far better supervised on the campus and are much better off in every way than past generations of students at Yale or any other college . In the nineteenth century at Yale , for example , the hazing of freshmen went on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The often unpleasant early spring weeks were called the " freshman rains , " and the sophomores regularly beat up the first-year men on the debatable theory that they were responsible for the weather . Freshmen ( Continued on Page 56 ) also ? kere pelted with snowballs that had been soaked in water and frozen solid . In 1869 one such snowball light , according to the Yale News , imohed the entire college and spread out across the city , where street lights , windows and many heads were broken by rioters or by police . In those days , too , there was a traditional freshman-sophomore " rush " at the start of each term . The two classes assembled on opposite sides of the campus . Members of each class crowded close together and clasped their arms around one another , forming a kind of human battering ram . At a signal the two masses charged each other , smashing together like herds of angry buffalo . The idea was to hold your own formation and break the enemy into small pieces . The result was terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the melee , clothes were torn to shreds and many combatants left the field in their underwear or less . Although such exercises , in theory , enabled the boys to work off excess energy and then buckle down to their hooks , the many severe rules laid down by college authorities in the old days leave no doubt that campus high jinks were even more of a problem than they are today . There was , for instance , a fine of fifty cents for throwing water from upper dormitory windows . A student might be expelled for atheism , for dressing flamboyantly or for " unnecessarily walking abroad on Sunday . " Expulsion was automatic for " blasphemy , fornication , theft , forgery or dueling . " Some of the early hazing customs held over in greatly modified form until recent years , but they have now all been abandoned . Abandoned , too , but by official decree , is another springtime event that was known as Derby Day . On Derby Day large numbers of students and their dates journeyed to the banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch rowing races , but actually to drink beer , eat hot cheigs and blow off steam in a big way . The students engaged in various competitions , pushed one another into the river and fought battles with high-powered water guns . This was all good fun , but it was not so amusing when , returning to New Haven , the students turned their water guns on every traffic policeman they encountered . The cops grinned and put up with this for a few years . But then the students began loading their water guns with beer and spraying every policeman they met . That ended Derby Day ! Before Derby Day was abolished , however , there was an occasion on which freshmen and sophomores staged a tug of war in a field on the banks of the Housatonic . The contest was near an old-fashioned Chic Sales outhouse , and the freshmen. led by James Whitmore , now a well-known movie and television performer , managed to maneuver the sophomores close to the dilapidated little building . Then , at a signal from Whitmore , a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team dragged their foes through the wreckage . The sophomores were humiliated , but there was n't much they could do about it until the next evening when they organized a muscular raiding party and invaded the freshman campus with the intention of knocking the tar out of Whitmore and his cohorts . The freshmen fought back with fists and a couple of lire hoses . By the time the police got there , about all they could do was lock all gates except one , through which they tried to force the sophomores back into their own territory . I arrived on the scene at the height of the melee and just in time to see Ina a dozen freshmen bouncing a sophomore in a big blanket . They tossed him high into the air and , on the fourth bounce , they threw him clear over the high iron fence and into a group of his classmates who had been pushed off the freshman campus . " Well , " 1 said to one of the policemen on the scene , " if they just keep that up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . " " Oh , no , " he replied . " They 've bounced that same student over the fence four times , and the sophomores just bounce him right back again ! " And , sure enough , at that moment the sophomores swung a blanket vigorously , the boy flew into the air and over the fence , landed in a group of freshmen and began swinging with both fists . ' r it it Anybody who is concerned with campus discipline is pretty sure to develop a high respect for the ability of students to think fast in a pinch and to lind ingenious ways to circumvent the hand of authority . I remember one tall , handsome youngster  --  Sonny Tufts , who later migrated to Hollywood with considerable success  --  who often was at the scene of campus high jinks , but was never caught in the act . Then late one snowy December evening I got a frantic call that seven students were throwing snowballs , fighting and creating a riotous situation outside the Yale Theater , where they had snarled traffic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office , but somebody saw me coming . When I got there , I struggled through the blocked traffic and the crowd , and perhaps with some feeling of satisfaction , I caught a glimpse of Tufts ' head . Air , I thought , at last ? But when I advanced a little farther , I saw that he and six other students were standing under a street light , their arms around one another 's shoulders in brotherly fashion , their eyes lifted to the heavens and their voices lifted in a Christmas carol ! The seven turned toward me with a gaze of utmost innocence , and I stopped dead . Who could crack down on a band of Christmas carolers ? Sometimes , particularly for the Harvard football game , we suffered an invasion of pranksters from Cambridge . On the morning of the big game some years ago we discovered that the goal posts in the Yale Bowl had been painted a brilliant Harvard crimson . We had to hurry with quick-drying white paint to erase that job before game time . At another Yale-Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of tearing down the goal posts after a victory by putting up steel posts sunk in concrete . To our great satisfaction , it worked . The Harvard team won , and Harvard boys attacked the goal posts but could n't tear them down and were finally pushed away by guards . I was pleased until late that night when we got a hurry call from a watchman who had heard some strange noises in the Bowl . When we got there , we found a half dozen resourceful and persistent Harvard boys using hack saws , crowbars , axes and other implements to cut down the steel goal posts . With college boys , a cop can never be sure that he 's ahead of the game . Our most harrowing encounter with Harvard students probably was the famous " dognaping " case in 1934 . Handsome Dan II , the squat , ferocious-looking but sweet-tempered bulldog mascot of Yale athletic teams , was snatched at the start of the Easter vacation . A bit of bright red fabric left on the scene of the crime made it look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school 's humor magazine . Lampoon , were suspected . A Yale raiding party " swooped down on panic-stricken Cambridge " a few days later , according to the Yale News , searched in vain for Handsome Dan and attempted to kidnap the editor of Lampoon as a hostage . But they were driven off after a fight . The " dognaping " became a front-page story in newspapers all over the country during the next week . Then the Lampoon editors announced they had solved the case , " rescued " Handsome Dan and , with great fanfare , were returning him in an effort " to better the relations between Harvard and Yale . " The mascot was safely delivered by Harvard yard police to our office late that evening . It was a terrible humiliation for everybody on the Yale campus , but the worst was yet to come . The next morning the ATuRDAY EvEN1N0 rciST Lampoon hit the newsstands with a cove ' photograph of the well-known statue 01 John Harvard  --  and with Handsome Dan licking John Harvard 's boots ! It was n't until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " poor Dan by depriving him of a meal and then smearing hamburger meat on the feet of the statue to assure his co-operation with the enemy photographer . Now , all of these high jinks are the kind of student activities that can cause college authorities and campus cops a lot of headaches , but usually they are the result of high spirits that any parent  --  or any cop  --  ought to expect in boys of college age . On the other hand , as I mentioned at the beginning of this article , there are far more serious campus incidents that may gravely affect a boy 's future and that , in many cases , can be plainly traced to the attitude of the student 's parents . Far too often a student 's troubles at college are due to parental insistence that he study for a profession in which he is not interested or a father 's expectation that his son should become a " big shot " on the campus or a mother 's refusal to untie her apron strings and let her son live his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for failure of a boy to adjust to life at a college like Yale . Some worry over unhappy love affairs . Others ca n't make the transition from being a big frog in a little pool at their hometown high schools to being just another frog in the big pool at Yale . But the parent problem is usually the most difficult to handle . There are many signs by which a campus cop can recognize impending trouble . For example , I always worried when 1 observed that a student I knew to be naturally conservative suddenly blossomed out in bright red socks or a colorful jacket or a beard . That was usually a sign he was troubled or insecure and was trying to attract attention to himself . We had one case where a student dressed in a tight-fitting hood and cape like the costume worn by a comic-strip character called the Phantom and wandered through dark streets at night until the city police picked him up . Another student moved a chair from his room each night into the hall and sat there to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't " belong " in his room . His roommate assured us the boy was able and friendly but " just upset about something . " The police , of course , do n't attempt to handle such cases by themselves . We are merely the front line in a team composed of the various deans , members of the faculty and the Department of Mental Hygiene psychiatric staff . In this case the college psychiatrist Soon discovered that the boy 's parents had insisted he take various courses in which he was not interested . A letter to the parents explained the situation : they replied that the boy was free to make his own decisions , and the young man was soon doing fine in classes . An extreme instance of attracting attention occurred some years ago when a graduate student who had been in the Army appeared on the campus wearing part of his old uniform and brandishing a heavy club that looked something like a rifle . He took a position behind some shrubbery with his back to a wall and began swinging the club at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was obviously impossible to approach him without grave risk that someone would be hurt . After stalling for about fifteen minutes , one of the policemen realized the student was reliving his own military experience and presumably ( Continued on Page 58 ) 4Civiriamedfiviiti Page 561i would respect the voice of authority . We summoned a uniformed officer from the R.O.T.C. headquarters and informed him of the situation , He then approached the student , clicked his heels and called out , " Atten-tion ! " The student dropped his club and snapped to attention . Then he meekly obeyed the officer 's command to " follow me " and was conducted to the hospital . When cases of student insecurity arc spotted early , it often is easy to give a helping hand . It has been a tremendous experience for me to sec each new class of freshmen come to the campus , most of them just shaking off adolescence . In the first few weeks they are groping awkwardly for some secure ground , testing their ideas and their ideals against those of other students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of doubt- and perhaps they stumble a bit as they try to find their way . The university has elaborate facilities for assisting and counseling them , and most of them adjust quickly with very little help . One freshman who got into a minor jam several years ago came into my office in a belligerent mood , ready for big trouble and unresponsive to my efforts to talk pleasantly . " You would n't give a damn if I was fired out , " he said . " Neither would the dean . " 1 got up and locked the office door in an effort to give him a feeling of privacy , Then I directed the talk not to how he had misbehaved but why . Finally he said in disgust , " Aw , I 'm just a number here . Nobody cares what happens to me . " After that , he talked freely and told me of several personal problems that did n't really amount to much , although he tried to magnify them . I let him ramble on without much comment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here thinking the best I could hope for was a little sympathy , but I did n't get any . " " I 'm just trying to understand your problems , " l replied . He looked at me with a kind of curious relief and grinned a little sheepishly . " Yeah . " he said , gelling up to shake hands , " I guess it was understanding I really wanted . I have n't had anybody I could talk to  --  not even my roommates . Thanks a lot , " That boy never had any further difficulties at Yale , and I felt that by just listening I had been able to help him at a critical moment . It is seldom so easy to help in cases where students are under strong parental pressures . For example , a parent who became a popular leader at Yale in his day may expect his son to do the same regardless of his temperament or ability . Sometimes a son may go to extremes in a vain effort to live up to his parents ' expectations , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role as a campus big shot . Most of the stealing at a college like Yale is done by outsiders who become , familiar with campus routine and know the best time to slip into dormitory rooms . Or occasionally we have a young thief like the youth I shall call Tom Blank , who posed as a member of the Krupp family from Germany , made friends with several rich Yale students , visited their rooms  --  and robbed them blind at every opportunity . After several weeks he realized he was under suspicion and disappeared , but shortly afterward he sent invitations to ten of his Yale friends to be his guests at dinner at a nearby hotel . The students went to the hotel at the appointed hour . So did the police . The police hid themselves in strategic spots while the students were conducted to a table , elaborately decorated with flowers , which the hotel manager had prepared in response to a telegram from the host . The host , however , did not appear . The guests decided to eat anyway at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telegram ? " Hearty eating and best wishes to all . Tom . " About a year later Tom was arrested in New Mexico on charges growing out of various other escapades . I remember one Yale student from a small Western town who became friendly with a group of Eastern students who had plenty of spending money . The Westerner needed extra money to keep up with his friends and over a period of several months he became responsible for a series of mysterious " breakfast time thefts . " At first the police were baffled . But we finally were able to put together enough information to narrow our investigation to one building . The thefts almost always occurred just before breakfast , when students left their dormitory rooms and went down the hall to take a shower . They often left the doors of their rooms ajar and their wallets on the bureaus . The thief could enter when he heard the shower turned on , take whatever was available and leave before the shower was turned off , After several unsuccessful attempts to catch the culprit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he could watch the movements of the police and watchmen . Then one night asked two boys to sleep in another dormitory . Early the next morning I slipped into the building through a door that could not be observed . I told the janitor to remain in the basement . I marked some bills and put them in a wallet on the bureau in the vacated room . Just before breakfast time I went to the shower room , turned on a shower and hurried back to the vacated room , leaving the door ajar . I hid in a closet . Not long afterward a boy in a bathrobe slipped in and walked across the room to look into the adjoining study . I grabbed him . " What are you doing here ? " I demanded . " I came in to borrow a book . " " What book ? " He could n't name any that he might find in the room . Then he said he had come in to borrow some shaving cream . But he had his own shaving cream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been responsible for the thefts . He was expelled , of course , but the ending to this story was different from the usual run of campus thefts . Within a year , the boy had sent to college authorities enough money to pay back all of the students he had robbed . And today he is a famous man who has borne great responsibilities and has had January 28 , 1961 an outstanding success in the world of big business . A fcw years ago his only son was graduated from Yale . Perhaps the most common problem encountered by college officials everywhere is that of parental domination . One morning about fifteen years ago I was summoned by an indignant cook to the dining hall of one of our colleges . The place was a wreck . Eggs had been hurled at the ceiling . Catchup bottles had been emptied on the floor . Food and utensils had been scattered in whirlwind fashion . No Sherlock Holmes was needed . Obviously someone had come in through a window and , as he departed , he had walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended  --  his footprints could have been followed by a blind Pekingese with a head cold . I followed them to a dormitory where I found a student , with catchup stains on his shoes , lying on a bed in a friend 's room . I knew the boy . He was intelligent and likable . But he had refused to study , and after two years , it seemed unlikely he would ever achieve his officially recorded purpose of entering the Law School . I tried to be friendly . " You got some feeling against food ? " I asked . He shook his head . " Well , " I said , " you threw eggs all over . What was the idea  --  what were you aiming at ? " He tensed up and said , " My father 's head out in Tulsa ! " Then he began to talk . His grandfather had been a famous frontier judge . His lawyer uncle had gone to Congress . His father was a well-known lawyer . His parents had assumed he would be a lawyer too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer , they ridiculed his boyish ideas and reminded him of the legalistic achievements of his forebears . He gave in and came to Yale to study law . But he was unhappy and in rebellion . At last he mistakenly decided that the only solution to his troubles was to do something for which he would be expelled  --  and in that he succeeded . But it was a tragedy that could have been avoided if his parents had treated him as a person with an identity of his own and not tried to force their ideas on him . Let me give one other example . Some years ago a very promising young man arrived at Yale with a very formidable handicap  --  his mother . She moved into a New Haven hotel the day before the term opened and settled down , apparently determined to keep her apron strings wrapped firmly around the boy 's neck . I felt sorry for the boy on the first day , but I was sorrier still a few days later when the mother came to my office and asked if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son 's room so she could talk to him when he finished his classes . I arranged it . Even so , for a few days the boy seemed to be adjusting himself . But his mother thought he was n't studying enough and said so . Then the boy just stopped returning to his room in the late afternoon . His mother sat there waiting , but he went out for a beer or to a movie . After a few weeks the mother showed up again in my office to talk about her troubles . " I just do n't know what to do about him , " she complained . " If only there were someone to advise me . " " Madam , " I said , taking a deep breath , " I 'm going to try . You may think my words are brutal , but I am sincere . Your presence here has denied your son the freedom to be himself . So if you want to help him , I advise you to pack your bags and leave for home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you were in my employ , " she said in what I assume was her drawing-room manner , " I would discharge you . But on second thought , I will take your advice . " She departed early the next day . About a week later her son 's roommate stuck his head in my door and said , " Hey , captain , what 's happened to my roommate ? " Alarmed , I asked what he meant . " Well , he 's a new man these days . Doing fine . What happened ? " I relaxed . " I do n't know , " I replied . He grinned , " The heck you do n't , " he said , slamming the door shut . Whenever I talk to dominating parents such as that woman , I recall the case of a famous and very tough New York businessman whose son ran away from home a week or so before he was scheduled to enter Yale . The reason was simple  --  his father never let him decide anything or act on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found the boy and persuaded him to return home , but only after I had had several unpleasant telephone conversations with the hot-tempered fathdr . Later , however , I received a letter of thanks from the father , and then one evening he telephoned me and said in a rather contrite voice , " I just want to ask you  --  how the devil do you know so much about boys ? " " I have a son , " I replied , " and I 've lived with boys here for a good many years . By the way , I suggest you look in your library for a book called Unicorn and Other Poems , by Anne Morrow Lindbergh . Look on page thirteen . " " Captain , " he said quietly , " tell me what it says . " I repeated it to him from memory . Him that I love , I wish to be Free Even from me. ? " Thanks , " he said as he hung up . " Thank you very much . " Now , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominate their children or that all students would get along well if it were n't for parents . Not at all .

There can be a wonderful feeling between the son and the father who accompanies him to the campus , takes a look at his room and says , " O.K. , you 're well set up here . Call on me any time you need me . You can even ask me to a football game . But it 's your life , and you 've got to decide what you will make of it . Good luck , son , and keep your nose clean . " I remember an incident back in the 1920 's before Yale abandoned the traditional freshman-sophomore " rush , " which was a more or less supervised roughhouse on the campus at the beginning of the fall term . During one of these melees I saw a dignified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fashion plate , walk onto the campus . They stopped near me , and the man asked , " What on earth is going on ? " I explained and added something about building up class spirit and enthusiasm . He did not seem to be much impressed . " My wife was opposed to our son 's coming to Yale , " he finally said . " She thought it was too far from home . I overruled her , but now that I see what goes on here , I think I may have been wrong .... What do you think , son ? " We turned to look at the boy , but he was gone . We scouted around a bit with no luck . But not long afterward we saw a strange figure emerge from the thick of the battle  --  a boy wearing only shoes , socks , underwear and a black eye . He grinned from ear to ear when his father finally recognized him , and after a moment the father grinned back . Nobody could doubt that the boy had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On second thought , " the father said , " I guess I was right . " I doubt that we will ever discover a formula by which campus cops or anybody else can curb the high spirits of American college boys or even keep up with their ingenious high jinks . In fact , if I thought their spirit could be curbed , I would begin to be really worried about the future . Meanwhile , I know that despite their impulse to blow off steam occasionally , our college students are learning how to face life on their own and , in many instances , how to become leaders of men . I know this because I have watched so many young men reach that critical point where they decided for themselves the course they would follow as adults and then went on to high success in life . I still keep in touch with many of them who sometimes recall that I did or said something that was helpful to them when they were students , but I will mention only one . He was the principal speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement . He began by saying something about his guilty reminiscences of student life . At first I could n't imagine what he was talking about . But after searching my memory I dimly remembered a night when a few students were knocking tennis balls around with fraternity paddles and things got rather out of hand and sonic electric light bulbs or perhaps some windows were broken . I had talked to this particular student like a Dutch uncle , as I recall it , and that was about all there was to it . But he remembered because I heard him saying , " And if it had n't been for the understanding of this man " ? meaning me ? " I probably would n't be here speaking to you tonight . " Now , that statement was a considerable exaggeration , but I was interested in hearing it because the speaker was A. Whitney Griswold , who for the past ten years has been president of Yale University .                    @
