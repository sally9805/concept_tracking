txt Mayor Lindsay and Bronx Borough President Herman Badillo yesterday assailed " some candidates " whose advertisements appealed to " suspicion and fear , " and asked all candidates to repudiate such appeals . Mayor Lindsay , who read the joint statement of the two mayoral candidates at . a City Hall news conference , said in response to questions , " I do n't wish to make any specific reference to any candidate or any advertisement . " Mr. Badillo , however , said in a telephone interview that he was " talking specifically about the advertisements of Robert F. Wagner . " Paul R. Screvane , Mr. Wu gner 's campaign manager , promptly assailed the Badillo-Lindsay statement . " Why do these two particular candidates speak out together ? " Mr. Screvane asked through a press spokesman . " If they did not see partisan advantage to themselves , they might well have asked all those who share the viewpoint to join in such a statement . " Of particular significance is the Badillo-Lindsay tie-up . We have long known that Mayor Lindsay wants Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he easier to heat . He therefore joins Mr , Bacilli ? in a statement hoping that Mr. Bacilli ? will , as a result , takes votes from Bob Wagner , and thus help Mr. Procaccino . " Mr. Screvane added that the Wagner ticket endorsed the repudiation of appeals to suspi/ don and fear . Many political observers believe that Mr. Wagner is the front-runner in the Democratic mayoral primary , and therefore the man Mr. Badillo must defeat if he is to win . Mr. Wagner also is widely believed to be the most formidable rival for Mr. Lindsay in the general election . Lindsay Assured Spot Mr. Lindsay , while opposed in the Republican , mayoral primary , is assured of a place on the ballot in November because he is the mayoral candidate of the Liberal party . Advised that Mr. Badillo had identified Mr. Wagner as the target of the joint appeal , a press spokesman for the Mayor said that Mr. Lindsay would not elaborate on his remarks at the news conference . " I think it 's a disgrace that Robert F. Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to use slogans that are calculated to appeal to fear and division , " said Mr. Badillo , who initiated the joint statement . He said that he was referring specifically to two advertisements . One was a television commercial that shows Mr. Wagner under a theater marquee in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn , saying that he would not let his wife walk down the street alone at night . The commercial ends with Mr. Wagner advising voters that if they vote late , they should not go to the polls alone . The other advertisement , Mr. Badillo said , was a poster reading : " End the War in New York , too . " " As the mayoral campaigns reach their conclusions , the temptation of an appeal to suspicion and fear is great , " the Badillo-Lindsay statement said . " Indeed , in recent weeks there have been unsettling signs of just such appeals in the advertisements of some candidates . " Badillo Assailed The Lindsay-Badillo tie-up was assailed by Richard A. Brown , campaign manager for Representative James H. Scheuer , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of what many people have thought for a long time , that the candidacy of Mr. Badillo in the Democratic primary is essentially a stalking horse for Mayor Lindsay , " Mr. Brown said . Controller Mario A. Procaccino , another Democratic mayoral candidate , said that he agreed with the request to repudiate appeals to suspicion and fear , but added that the joint statement was another attempt to evade discussion of the issues . Norman Mailer , the fifth Democratic mayoral candidate , could not be reached for comment . State Senator John J. Marchi , Mr. Lindsay 's opponent in the Republican primary , said that " this hackneyed attack by Lindsay and Badillo against candidates who ' appeal to hate and fear ' is reminiscent of the campaign for Lindsay 's ill-fated civilian review board in 1966 . " " The voters of New York City had better sense in 1966 than to heed these inflammatory and deceitful attacks , when the Lindsay review board went down to a crashing defeat , " he said . " We are .. sure that they will have better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear have no place in the political life of a great city , " Mr. Lindsay said at his news conference . " This campaign must be conducted on the issues , not on the false appeals to division and mistrust which have so badly scarred other communities in recent months . " The Mayor lashed out last night at Barry Gray , the WMCA radio commentator , saying he was " biased and hostile toward both me and my administration . " Mr. Lindsay , who was a guest on the Barry Gray show , told Mr. Gray that he had " no understanding of the urban crisis and , even worse , you are frightening people unnecessarily . " He said he had often listened to the program and was " not impressed . " He added that he had " received fair treatment when I am here , but when I leave it becomes a snide kind of show . " Mr. Lindsay , asked why he had not urged other candidates to support the joint statement , replied : " This is a statement that Mr. Badillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that all candidates will want to support this statement . " Mr. Marchi also held a news conference , at which he asserted that he had the support ' of the overwhelming majority of Republican officeholders from New York City . He said Mayor Lindsay had made " common cause with reactionary elements " in a " desperate " effort to gain Republican support . Mr. Lindsay , meanwhile , took his campaign to Queens , where the women at a Republican club in Astoria were friendly . But in a park in Flushing , two dozen women and children booed him , and chanted : " We want Marchi . Get out , you bum . " Later , Mr. Lindsay flew to a labor union conference in the Poconos , where he ridiculed Mr. Wagner ? without mentioning him by name  --  for having promised to make New York " a good union town . " The Mayor said his labor record was better than Mr. Wagner 's . Governor Rockefeller has called all Republican district leaders in Manhattan , Brooklyn and Queens to meet with him this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Louis J. Lefkowitz , who has campaigned for Mayor Lindsay , urged the Governor to call the closed door meeting , which will be held at 4:30 P.M. at the New York Hilton . Republican leaders from the Bronx and Staten Island , already committed to backing Mr. Marchi , were not invited to the meeting .
