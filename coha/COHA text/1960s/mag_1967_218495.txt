The State Department 's announcement was about as terse as a bureaucratic bulletin can be . Janos Radvanyi , Hungary 's chief of mission to the U.S. , had " decided that he wishes to become a permanent resident of the United States , and it is our understanding that he is submitting a letter of resignation to his government . " Thus last week , little more than two months after the defection of Svetlana Allilueva Stalina , another Communist VIP made the big switch . The highest-ranking Communist diplomat ever to have defected to the West , * Radvnyi was , in addition , an invaluable source for U.S. intelligence on recent events in the fast-changing countries of Eastern Europe . <P> An affable professional who has held some of Hungary 's most sensitive diplomatic posts , Radvnyi was sent to Washington in 1962 to further the Kdr regime 's goal of improving Hungary 's strained relations with the U.S. In this he was partially successful , since Washington was by no means reluctant ; and he was instrumental in getting both countries to agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January of Radvnyi 's promotion from charg d'affaires to ambassador , one of his fondest dreams ; Washington had only to announce its own ambassadorial appointment to Budapest to make it official . <P> A Simple Matter . Early last week Radvnyi called his office to say that he planned to take a few days off . Next he called " American authorities " - most likely his old friend Dean Rusk-to ask asylum for himself , his wife Julianna and their son Jnos , 15 . When his housekeeper , a watchdog assigned by Budapest , returned to the Radvnyis ' house at 2838 Arizona Avenue , N.W. , from a shopping trip the following afternoon , the three occupants had disappeared with their possessions and left no forwarding address ( they went to a suburban hideout ) . Forty-five minutes later , the State Department made its laconic statement . <P> Why had he come over ? Personal considerations-his wife had been ill for some time-unquestionably played a part . But another reason he gave U.S. authorities was his country 's hardening attitude toward the American position in Viet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a short-lived effort to bring Hanoi and Washington together before and during the 1966 bombing pause , Budapest gave up all efforts to effect a settlement last fall and reportedly ordered Radvnyi to abandon mediation attempts . Devoutly believing in closer East-West relations , Radvnyi became increasingly-and , in the end , irrevocably-frustrated by his government 's instructions , and opted for American citizenship rather than a Hungarian ambassadorship . <P> * Though a Rumanian minister and another Hungarian head of mission defected to the U.S. in the ' 40s , neither was as high in his own government as Radvnyi , who held the coveted rank of career ambassador .
