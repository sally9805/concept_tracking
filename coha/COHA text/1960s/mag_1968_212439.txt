When two companies agree to merge and then the deal falls through , neither side is likely to be very happy about it . Last week , after International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . called off its proposed get-together with American Broadcasting Companies , Inc. , the reaction was not at all usual : sighs of relief were audible in the front offices of both companies . <P> For ITT Chairman-President Harold Geneen , who had hoped to fashion the two firms into a $2.5 billion telecommunications colossus , the decision was largely a matter of money . Announced in December 1965 , the merger has been held up by Justice Department antitrust litigation after being twice approved by the Federal Communications Commission . During the delay , a sharp increase in ITT 's stock sent its purchase price for ABC soaring . <P> With ITT common shares selling for about $68 at the time , Geneen 's original stock offer was worth some $365 million . At last week 's closing of $113 , the total would have been about $605 million . To guard against just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified that either side could withdraw if the merger was still hanging fire by the end of 1967 . On New Year 's morning , Geneen accordingly summoned his board , 45 minutes later informed ABC that the deal was off . <P> Sparing the Court . At first glance , ABC had plenty of reason to be disappointed . The No. 3 network behind NBC and CBS , it has been sorely strapped for capital to complete its switchover to color television programming , will need additional funds for coverage of this year 's national political conventions . To help out its prospective partner , ITT last year advanced ABC $25 million , which must now be repaid-with interest-within a year . <P> Nonetheless , ABC greeted Geneen 's news with what Vice President James C. Hagerty called " a sort of relief . " After all , the ITT deal pretty much constrained the network from seeking other sources of help . Now free to maneuver , ABC may well issue new securities to raise the capital it needs . More likely , it will seek out new merger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industries , both of which expressed interest in the network before ITT came on the scene . <P> Whatever its effect on the two companies , the breakup most certainly unburdened Washington 's U.S. Court of Appeals , which was thus spared from having to reach a decision on the controversial merger-after deliberating on it for more than five months .
