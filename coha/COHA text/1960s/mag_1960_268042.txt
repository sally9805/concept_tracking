<P> FOR the man with only $250,000 to spend on Christmas presents this year , there is a store dedicated to providing a wide selection of worldly goods tailored to his budget : Neiman-Marcus of Texas . There he may very well be waited on by the saturnine president of the company , Stanley Marcus , 55 , who scours the world looking for unique , elegant and off-beat items-and likes to sell them himself . This Christmas , for the well-heeled customer , he has a matched pair of Beechcraft airplanes neatly emblazoned " His " and " Hers " for $176,000 , an espresso coffee-making machine at $250 , or a roast beef serving cart for $2,230 ( which , Marcus points out , " includes 300 lbs . of steaks or 600 lbs . of beef on the hoof " ) . <P> In the oil-welling land of the big spenders , Marcus has sought not only to create a store devoted to luxury but to provide standards that his often newly rich customers can rely on . Operating a store that is in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively imposed Eastern and Continental taste on his customers . Though ready to indulge rich whims , he has been known to kill a good sale if he thinks a purchase is not suitable , e.g. , a mink coat for a college freshman . As a result , Neiman-Marcus is a respected name in stylish circles around the world . In the past decade Neiman-Marcus ' sales have nearly doubled , will hit $41 million this year . The original store in downtown Dallas has branched into a suburban Dallas store and one in Houston . Last week Stanley Marcus announced plans for a new $2,000,000 store to be completed in 1962 in suburban Fort Worth . <P> THE idea of a luxury store in a cattle-and-cotton city of 86,000 seemed slightly pretentious when Neiman-Marcus was founded in 1907 by Stanley 's father , Herbert Marcus , and his aunt and uncle , Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Neiman . It was doing all right in 1926 , with sales of $2,600,000 , when Harvard-educated Stanley , then 21 , went to work in the store 's fur shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before the shop had sold only $74,000 worth of pelts . Using the casual , low-pressure manner that he still assumes behind a counter , he sold $74,000 in furs in his first four months on the job . By the end of his first year , fur sales were $420,000 . <P> His selling touch was matched by his talent for promotion and advertising . He instituted the annual Neiman-Marcus fashion design awards , which draw top designers from New York and Paris to the heart of Texas to show their originals . In his self-appointed role as the omninventoried merchant prince , Marcus window-shops Europe with his camera in search of ideas , on one trip spotted a French silk housecoat that he copied this year in chinchilla . Price : $7,950 . " We have n't sold any yet , " he admits , " but we 've had a couple of inquiries . I like it , and I like to keep my own appetite as a consumer whetted . " <P> <P> HE pays his help well ; a few Neiman clerks , working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25,000 a year . In return Marcus demands that they be unfailingly polite no matter how uncouth the customer may seem . He likes to remind them of the cotton-smocked girl who once came in straight off her father 's farm . Papa had just struck oil , and Daughter spent $10,000 to outfit herself in style , including shoes for her bare feet .
