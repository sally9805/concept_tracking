One of the reasons for Diem 's election success in the hinterland is a lean exCommunist named Colonel Pham Ngoc Thao , 39 . Last year he accosted President Diem , told him that the reason the Communist Viet Cong guerrillas were scoring success after success lay in the shortcomings of Diem 's own soldiery . " Our soldiers need social and political education , " said Thao . " Their discipline is poor . They have no consideration for the people . " Their " bad habits " - stealing rice , pigs and girls - were driving the villagers to the Communist cause . <P> <P> Election Toll . Diem responded by handing Colonel Thao command of vital , rice-growing Kienhoa province in the Mekong River delta , where previous commanders had failed . There Thao has cut the guerrillas down to size with skill and daring at their own nighttime jungle tactics . " When there is too much light , you can see nothing , " says Thao . " The truth is in the night . " <P> Last week Thao grimly counted an election-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle skirmishes . Though the Communists warned that they would shoot any " traitor " who voted , Thao got 83% of his voters to the polls . " We tried a little propaganda of our own , " he admits . " We told the people that if they did not vote , they would have trouble getting jobs or help from the government . " <P> Educated as a civil engineer in Saigon , Thao fought nine years with the Communist Viet Minh against the French . But he quit the Viet Minh shortly after the Geneva peace conference in 1954 , partly because he is a Roman Catholic ( his brother is still a Communist and currently North Viet Nam 's Ambassador to East Germany ) . And when his former comrades-in-arms started terrorizing South Vietnamese villages , Thao joined the army against them . <P> Quick Action . In Kienhoa , Thao found the local security chief had been extorting money from the villagers by threatening them with prison . Thao arrested him . He also freed 1,200 political prisoners held in the local jail without evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , he 's obviously under Communist pressure , and if he 's under Communist pressure , that means he 's not getting government protection . Why should he go to prison ? " Dismayed to learn that Kien-hoa 's 1,500 crack troops waited days for orders before going to the help of besieged villages . Thao led them into action himself in his Jeep . Where the roads ended , Thao and his men paddled off by canoe in silent search of the enemy . Thao set up a Communist-style intelligence network , paying peasants liberally for information on guerrilla moves . <P> In just four months , Thao has recaptured about half of the 75 villages once controlled by the Communists in Kienhoa . He has driven the surviving 800 guerrillas into a 130-sq. - mi. pocket and hopes to have them cleaned out within a year . He has torn down most of the jails in the province , built hospitals and schools , and he is now training 370 schoolteachers to replace corrupt village officials . Says Thao : " It is a long , slow process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . "
