The Administration may have quietly laid to rest its oft-proclaimed , oft-abused 3.2% wage-price " guideposts " last month , but it did not entirely give up the idea of restraint . As far as prices go , warned the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , there are still plenty of areas " about which guidepost questions might be raised . " The questions , and a flock of the old familiar Administration telegrams , flew last week in one of those areas : gasoline prices . <P> Two weeks ago several major suppliers increased the price they charge dealers by six-tenths of 1 per gal. , or about 2.5% . Except on the West Coast , which has long been a price-war battle ground , the increase has become general over most of the nation - meaning that motorists will be paying 1 per gal . more for their gas . <P> Hold the Line . The Administration 's reaction , when it came at midweek , did not seem as fast - or as fierce - as in past price-increase attempts . Messages to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the CEA but from Acting Interior Secretary Charles F. Luce , who mentioned " press reports " of the hikes and urged that they be rescinded in view of " the national interest in stable prices . " To companies that had not yet followed the increases , including Humble Oil , went requests to " hold the line . " <P> Some of the suppliers agreed to talk it over with Interior , but there were signs that the industry would hold its own line rather than the Administration 's . Cabling in reply , Phillips Petroleum President Stanley Learned told Luce that he " appreciated your concern " but felt that the industry could not " continue to absorb cost increases . " Sinclair , citing higher costs and depressed prices over the last decade , also said nothing doing . <P> Tougher Taxes . The gasoline producers have been anxious to beef up their profit margins ever since 1965 , when a long and costly series of price wars finally faded away . Though retail prices , excluding taxes , indeed rose nearly 4% during 1966 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the suppliers have a number of problems . Demand continues strong and refineries are being forced to pay more for crude oil . Labor settlements early this year have increased industry wages by 4% ; dealers , also squeezed by higher wages , have long been screaming for fatter prices at the pump . <P> <P> The yearlong rise in gasoline prices may make the current boost less defensible in the Administration 's eye than the recent increases pushed through by copper , steel and aluminum producers . A fact to remember , however , is that even at the new levels motorists would be paying about the same for gasoline as they did ten years ago had not federal and local taxes , now an average 10 a gallon , grown by 15% in that time .
