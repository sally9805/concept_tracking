What with weddings , wars and wages on his mind , President Johnson can use a few laughs . That may be why he granted a few minutes to the visitor who had just returned to the U.S. after a 15-day U.S.O. tour in Viet Nam . <P> And so into the oval office one day recently strutted a dapper dandy in brownish-grey toupee , cake makeup , Kings Man cologne , suede-and-'gator shoes , jeweled cuff links in the shape of a Jewish Torah , and a wristwatch with the letters of his name in place of the numerals . The watch spelled GEORGE JESSEL . The old vaudevillian briskly filled the President in on the war , assured him that he would waste no time in telling the world about the great job the boys were doing out there , and perhaps even winked a few funny lines at L.B.J. It was darn near R minutes after L before he departed . <P> Kosher Causes . Even at 68 , Georgie Jessel is as energetic as he was in the ' 20s when he hoofed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eddie Cantor . Nowadays , however , he sticks mainly to monologue , or rather oratory . He likes to think of himself as the " Toastmaster General of the U.S. " Since he is essentially a Jewish comic , he specializes in Israel-bond and similar fund-raising functions . He is equally proud of the fact that he spoke at inaugural parties for Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman and John Kennedy . <P> In all , Jessel figures that in the past 40 years he has raised about $100 million for good works : $60 million for Israel bonds , $5 million for the City of Hope medical center , and the rest for other assorted worthy causes . <P> <P> " I play God across the board , however , " he adds , " and have always served Catholic organizations well . " His reward : one box of cigars from Winston Churchill , 600 thank-you plaques , 200 City of Hope " torches , " honorary membership in 188 synagogues and in the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus , to say nothing of the nourishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also works for money ( $1,250 to $1,500 per appearance ) . One day it 's the National Distillers Convention in Chicago , the next a small club date in New York State . The routines are generally just that . Working in his own custom-designed U.S.O. uniform , he bats out long , involved stories or one-liners ( " I look at Jayne Mansfield and think , ' If only Nasser had them for tonsils ' " ) . Then he winds up telling about his U.S.O. tours and plugs the Administration 's Viet Nam policy .
