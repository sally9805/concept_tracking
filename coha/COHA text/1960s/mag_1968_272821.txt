Medical experts have long suspected that organs donated by cancer victims might cause danger-and possibly death - to their recipients . Still , for lack of other available transplant sources , they continued using them . Last week , writing in the New England Journal of Medicine , a kidney transplant team at Boston 's Peter Bent Brigham Hospital told how cancer can be transplanted along with a donated organ . At the same time , they provided new , clear-cut evidence that cancer , like a foreign organ , can also be rejected . <P> At least four early transplant patients who had received kidneys from donors with cancer later developed cancer themselves . Two of the four , operated on by a team headed by Dr. Richard E. Wilson , died as a result . A third died of complications following surgery . The fourth recipient , a 38-year-old father of ten , survived , further proving that the body 's immunological processes may cast out cancerous tissue in the same way that they reject any transplanted tissue when immunosuppressive drugs are not used . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from a donor who had died of cancer that had spread from the lungs to the brain . At the time of the transplant , there was no evidence to suggest the cancer had traveled to other parts of the victim 's body . Nonetheless , Palazola developed a malignant tumor near the transplanted kidney within 18 months . When radiation treatments failed to reduce the tumor , Palazola was taken off immunosuppressives . When this caused rapid rejection of the transplant , the kidney and most of the tumor were excised . <P> By August 1966 , six months later , Palazola 's immunological defenses had rid him of all the remaining cancer tissues . <P> Dr. Wilson and his colleagues performed a second transplant on Palazola in November 1966 . This time the donor was his mother . Last week the doctors reported that " he had returned to full daily activity and has remained free of cancer . "
