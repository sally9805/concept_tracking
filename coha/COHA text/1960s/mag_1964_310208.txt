Like the Amazonian rain forest or the skyline of Sao Paulo , inflation in Brazil never seems to stop growing . The cost of living last year rose 80.7% : auto prices increased 100% , drugs 78% and food 77% . Last week Brazil 's prices began a new spiral that threatens to make last year 's inflation appear mild . <P> President Joao Goulart has just signed a decree doubling the monthly minimum wage for urban Brazilian workers to 42,000 cruzeiros , which is $68 on the official exchange rate and about $30 in actual buying power . The workers are glad to get the cash they need to chase rising prices , but the new move adds just another episode to the nightmare that businessmen must endure to survive in Brazil . Says William Jones , general manager of Remington Rand in Brazil : " Every executive here should read Through the Looking Glass at least once each week-especially that part where Alice is told that she has to run fast just to keep in the same place . " <P> Adjusting Prices . Business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by runaway inflation , which has been accelerated by reckless government spending , constant labor demands for more money , and restrictive laws that force foreign companies to plow back their profits into the Brazilian economy . Between the time a businessman bids for an order and delivers the goods , he does not know how much the cost of the materials will rise , how high the workers ' wages will climb , how much his financing charges will increase , or even if his customer will be able to pay for the order . <P> " When I came here four years ago , " says William O. Kelleher , president of Sears , Roebuck in Brazil , " we were selling a 7-cu. - ft. refrigerator for 49,000 cruzeiros . Today that same refrigerator sells for 227,000 . " Coca-Cola raised its prices three times in 1963 . General Electric writes a clause into its sales contracts that allows for adjustments in the delivery price to compensate for inflation , and IBM does the same in its computer-rental contracts . <P> Companies must grant credit to attract the free-wheeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Customers understandably prefer to put off paying , because their wages are rising faster than prices ; thus , as each inflationary month passes , the bills in effect become smaller . Among the slowest payers : the Brazilian government , which seldom honors its bills promptly ; last week the U.S. and five other nations agreed to ease the burden of Brazil 's $3 billion debt by stretching out payment schedules . Businessmen are finding it difficult even to keep on hand enough cash to carry on . Willys of Brazil complains that many of its auto dealers are losing more money through inflation than they are able to make on their auto sales .
