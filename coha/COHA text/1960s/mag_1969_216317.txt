Johnson 's choices were two Pacific veterans , Pan American and Northwest , and newcomers TWA , Continental and all-cargo Flying Tiger . In addition , Braniff got new runs to Hawaii . Last week Richard Nixon said : nothing doing . In a letter to the Civil Aeronautics Board , Nixon stated that he would " recall the matter " and later on " advise you of my decision on the merits . " <P> Why the upheaval ? The losers-and some not-so-satisfied winners-had complained that Johnson 's original awards were made less on merit than on the wondrous performance of old political cronies who had interests in the victorious carriers .
