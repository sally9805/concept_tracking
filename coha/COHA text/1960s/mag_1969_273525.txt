While Apollo 9 astronauts were preparing for outer space , two crews of U.S. aquanauts began new missions to determine how well man can exist in inner space-the underwater depths . <P> Near San Clemente Island off the California coast , the Navy 's trouble-plagued " yellow submarine , " Sealab 3 , was lowered 610 ft. to the floor of the continental shelf . Then instruments indicated a helium leak in the still-unoccupied deep-sea habitat , and Aquanaut Berry L. Cannon , 33 , and two companions were sent below to make repairs . They descended to the 610-ft. level in a pressurized personnel transfer capsule ( PTC ) and were opening a hatch to enter Sealab when Navy officers watching a TV monitor on the surface saw Cannon begin to thrash about . " I saw his body jackknifing , making a rapid motion , " says Captain George Bond , Sealab 's chief medical officer . " Any time you see rapid motion in a diver , you know he 's in trouble . " Cannon died before he could be brought to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Navy investigation revealed that " one of the diving rigs in use by Sealab divers was equipped with an empty Bar-alyme canister . " Without the Baralyme , which absorbs carbon dioxide exhaled by the diver , the gas builds up in the system and can eventually cause suffocation . " This could explain the tragic event , " said a Navy spokesman , and indeed , an autopsy revealed " a greatly excessive " amount of carbon dioxide in Cannon 's blood . Navy officials ordered a halt to all diving . Sealab 3 , still leaking helium , was brought to the surface and lifted onto a barge to be taken ashore and repaired . <P> The tragedy marked still another lengthy setback for the Sealab project , which is already about two years behind schedule . Designed to help man learn the techniques and develop the equipment that will enable him to live and work for long periods under the sea , the project has been beset by delays . First there was a steel strike ; then some of the steel that was delivered turned unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called for after the fatal Apollo fire , and that was followed by a series of seawater and helium leaks . At week 's end no one would predict how long it will be until Sealab is again judged seaworthy . <P> A few days after other aquanauts set up housekeeping aboard Tektite , a second undersea habitat that had been lowered into Lameshur Bay at St. John , V.I. , one of four fire extinguishers began to leak carbon dioxide into the cabin . It was quickly placed outside . The following day , the unit that had detected the carbon dioxide ceased to function . But Tektite technicians began hourly atmosphere checks to ensure the safety of the aquanauts and expressed confidence that their mission would continue successfully for its scheduled two-month duration . If everything goes according to plan , the aquanauts hope to complete underwater biological and geological studies , learn more about diving and sonar techniques and supply medical and behavioral data that will help scientists plan the longer manned space flights of the future .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
