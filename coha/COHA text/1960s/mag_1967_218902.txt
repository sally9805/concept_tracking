For all their worries , businessmen rarely sound like apocalyptic prophets . Yet last week President Rudolph A. Peterson of the San Francisco-based Bank of America , the world 's largest private bank , gave ominous voice to a problem that increasingly dismays many U.S. leaders . In a London speech , Peterson warned that Europe 's " new economic nationalism " and the protectionist response it seems to be stirring up in the U.S. have created an impasse that could undermine world prosperity and even lead to war . <P> " The growing spirit of factionalism is a clear danger to the cohesion of the Atlantic community , " said Peterson . " At the very best , its projection into the future implies a slowdown in the economic growth rate of the free world and a particular slowdown in continental Europe .

Though Peterson 's audience was composed of British and U.S. businessmen at a Savoy Hotel lunch of the American Chamber of Commerce of the U.K. , his words were plainly aimed at corporate and government chiefs everywhere . " It is just possible , " said Peterson , " that businesses have the potential to handle internationalism better than governments . " Specifically , he proposed " increasing operational cooperation " among businessmen on both sides of the Atlantic , especially through multinational corporations-companies owned and operated by citizens of several nations . <P> Similar views have lately been aired with growing frequency by other U.S. executives , notably former Under Secretary of State George W.
