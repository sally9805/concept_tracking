So Give a Damn <P> Sir : As friends and former squadronmates of the 31 men lost last week in the Sea of Japan April 25 , we deeply mourn their deaths and ache with sorrow for their families . But we are angered and appalled , too , at the apparent contentment on the part of the American people to accept this loss with " cool " and " reserve , " euphemisms for disinterest and apathy . <P> As a lowly Navy wife , I do n't pretend to comprehend the intricacies of foreign policy and diplomacy . I refuse to understand , however , how a nation so full of people shouting " Give a damn " and " full commitment " can accept this so calmly . I suggest that the American people start to give a damn about those men doing so for them , to the last full measure . Shape up , America , and mourn your dead . You owe them that , and so much , much more . <P> ALICE DEWITT TRUSSELL <P> Beeville , Texas <P> Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is only one alternative . Retaliate ! The next time a North Korean spy plane comes to within 100 miles of America 's shores , shoot it down . <P> ( THE REV . ) GERARD S. MOSER St. Paul 's Church Rochester , N.Y . <P> Sir : This is a great time for feminists . For years , some people have said that the President of the United States ought to be a woman . Now the North Koreans have succeeded in turning him into one . <P> NOEL G. PETERSEN Spring Lake , Mich . <P> <P> By the Legion <P> Sir : Thank you for paying tribute to the mothers of America through Ethel Kennedy April 25 . She is not alone in her struggle to bring up children to lead fruitful lives . As a teacher of young children , I am daily inspired by those mothers who are dedicated to the task of teaching moral and social values to the future citizens of our country . They may not be as spectacular as Ethel , but their number is legion . All is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) RUBY EATON West Concord , Mass . <P> Sir : Your writer etched Ethel Kennedy 's many-faceted character with great care , pointing out the trivia , triumphs and tragedies of her rich life . Missing only was a reference to a personal relationship with the late Dr. Martin Luther King . Politically and psychologically , the two families had much in common , with sudden death to both fathers and husbands forming some kind of emotional tie . Thanks again for an excellent study of a complex , beautiful woman told by a writer who shows the rarest of gifts : loving concern for his subject . <P> GERALD F. MULLER St. Edward 's University Austin , Texas <P> Sir : You must be hard up for news stories when you have to run another feature of an apparently endless series on the Kennedys . <P> I have had my fill of them , with their avarice for power , their ruthlessness , and the spellbinding facility they have over other people . I can not believe that in their hearts they are truly for the poor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rung in the ladder to power . I further object to a feature on Ethel Kennedy because she should be left alone . She has had a lot of tragedy in her life , and baring it all to the public will not help her . She is a public personality , but leave her in peace . <P> S. ALAN BECKER Boston
