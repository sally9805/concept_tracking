In Buddhist temples , schools and village centers , the voters of South Viet Nam gathered last week , the women wearing their best tunics and diaphanous silk trousers . There was scattered gunfire as Communist guerrillas raided a polling place here and there . But when the returns were in , 75% of the electorate had defied Communist threats to kill anyone who voted , gave embattled President Ngo Dinh Diem a massive vote of confidence and another five-year term in office . Running against two unknowns , Diem piled up 88% of the vote . <P> In Saigon , Diem 's total dropped to 65% , and 26% of the electorate joined the Communist boycott and stayed home . This reflected , among other things , the capital 's widespread discontent among business and professional classes at the dictatorial methods Diem feels obliged to employ in his six-year-old fight against the Communist rebellion . But the very size of the opposition vote was evidence that the much abused Diem had run a reasonably honest election-and won .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
