Nearly everyone has heard of Rod McKuen : he has written 900 songs that have been recorded by other people and sold more than 50 million records ; his three books of poetry have sold more than a million copies . In his gritty wreck of a voice , he has recorded 35 albums of his own songs , and last year he wrote the scores for two movies . It was not until last week , though , that McKuen got that ultimate symbol of success : his own TV special , a one-man show on NBC , called " Rod McKuen : The Loner . " <P> McKuen 's absence from the TV screen until then was a matter of his own choice . He had turned down every offer to do a television special until he could do it on his own terms : a half-hour one-man show over which he had total control and no interference . <P> The show had impressive sparseness . Wearing a formless sweater , black pants and sneakers , McKuen kept the talk to a discreet minimum and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a medley of Stanyan Street , Lonesome Cities and Listen to the Warm - and reciting a poem about one of his few New York friends , A Cat Named Sloopy . He wandered through a set that seemed to have been plucked from a haunted harbor on San Francisco Bay . If the fog spewing out of the NBC special-effects machine looked at times as if it were going to swallow McKuen alive , at least the audience could rest assured that he would go down rasping out a song with lyrics that said something . <P> Rootless Childhood . The " Loner " title was corny but appropriate . McKuen has led his life mostly apart from others . He was born into the Depression in a Salvation Army hospital in Oakland , Calif. , shortly after his father had deserted the family . His mother worked as a waitress , a telephone operator and a dime-a-dance hostess until her marriage to a " cat-skinner " - the operator of Caterpillar tractors on Government road projects . McKuen was hauled from one construction site to another throughout the West and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family and spent four years drifting in and out of small Western towns . He took odd jobs : rod man on a survey crew , plowman , cowboy . <P> After serving during the Korean War , he appeared at the Purple Onion in San Francisco . Then he signed with Universal as a player in a few forgettable beach epics . " I never sat through one of my pictures , " McKuen recalls . " It was n't so much that they were bad . It 's just that they were so terribly dull . " Universal dropped him , and he headed East . " I was desperate . I lived off selling my blood . Or putting on my blue suit and going to hotels and crashing conventions for the canaps . " <P> The times were hard , but McKuen had a sweet tenor voice . In 1961 he wrote the music for a song that became a hit , The Oliver Twist . Capitalizing on his success , he set off on the road , doing 80 cities in eight weeks and singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal cords were irreparably damaged ; he was told that he would never sing again . But McKuen kept on , even though the tenor voice was replaced by a hoarse croak.
