A Republican Governor of the state of Mississippi ? There has been no such thing since 1876 , when one Adelbert Ames resigned under fire in his Reconstruction regime . In most elections since then the G.O.P. has either put up no candidate or furnished merely token opposition . About all the winner of a Democratic gubernatorial primary had to do was clear his throat and start polishing his inaugural speech . <P> But not this year . Heading for the Nov. 5 general election , Republican Rubel Phillips , 38 , a former Democrat who was a state public service commissioner , is putting up a strong enough fight to have Democrats , for the first time in decades , showing concern . <P> The Democrats began worrying early this month , when the G.O.P. plastered the state with full-color Phillips billboards , bought considerable television time , launched Phillips on a series of hearty handshaking tours throughout Mississippi . <P> Then came unmistakable signs of apathy among the Democratic rank and file . Two weeks ago , the party nominee , Lieutenant Governor Paul Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were supposed to gather in large numbers at the state 's 82 county courthouses . But few turned up , and many of them wandered away in the middle of Johnson 's speech . <P> Last week Democratic leaders organized a rare postprimary rally-a $25-a-plate dinner in Jackson featuring top Democratic brass , including the seven-man congressional delegation from Washington . Party publicists hoped that 7,500 would attend . But no more than 3,500 gathered in the half-empty hall . <P> Those who did show up heard some changed talk from party leaders , who had previously devoted most of their energies to attacking the Kennedy Administration . Paul Johnson complained about " Republican carpetbaggers " and cried : " The birth of a two-party system in the state would divide the conservative white vote . " Governor Ross Barnett shouted : " I 'm fed up with these fence-riding , pussyfooting , snow-digging Yankee Republicans . " And U.S. Senator John Stennis said that Mississippi Democrats must " get out and vote and thwart this challenge brought on by the Republicans . " <P> That , for Democrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has enough Democrats to defeat Republican Phillips . But those Democrats have become so accustomed to perfunctory , no-contest general elections that they might not take the trouble to vote . Were that to happen , Mississippi might experience the upset of all political upsets .
