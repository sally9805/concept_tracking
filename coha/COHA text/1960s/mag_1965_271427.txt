There are places in Brazil , that troubled but rich giant , where just scuffing a shovel in the dirt might produce treasures to dream about . To prove it , communities like Diamantina , Turmalina , Esmeralda , Ametista dot the country . Last week the scene was Cristalina ( pop . 3,800 ) , an interior town some 60 miles south of Brasilia , once the center of a fabulous quartz-crystal boom and now devoted largely to agriculture and cattle raising . <P> Off to the Farm . Last month two wandering prospectors stumbled on a 13-lb. hunk of white crystal on a 1,900-acre farm near Cristalina and hurried into town with the news . The reaction resembled The Gold Rush . The mayor , notary public , pharmacist and priest raced to the farm with the rest of the citizens hot on their heels . Laborers in nearby Brasilia threw aside their hods and streamed down the highway ; so did lawyers , senators , civil servants , housewives and doctors . <P> <P> Mining engineers pronounced the deposit virtually limitless , and that spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each newcomer was allowed to claim a 10-ft. by 10-ft. plot in return for 10% of the take . Within a few days , the farm land looked like a giant human anthill with more than 2,000 men , women and children feverishly wielding shovels . <P> The method was to dig a shaft straight down , sometimes 40 ft. or more , to the deposits ; the diggers climbed in and out by bracing their feet and backs against the wall . As shafts went down too closely together , many collapsed ; others filled with water . A shanty town sprang up next to the pasture , with a hotel , hundreds of lean-tos and tents . The local dentist kept his tools soaked in cachaga liquor ; the baker sold bread at five times the normal price ; and a small army of prostitutes paraded around the diggings , lining up appointments . <P> Candles for St. Sebastian . One digger came up with a block of crystal weighing 330 Ibs. , is still dickering with buyers about the price : the high-grade yellow variety fetches as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece worth $3,300 and immediately hired 100 men at $3 apiece per day to help him dig . A youth deserted his job in Bahia , 400 miles away , found a fine stone that he sold for $190 , later discovered that the buyer quickly resold it for more than $2,500 . Luckier was the young lady who spent four days digging in the pits , made $2,700 , then quit and went home a rich woman . <P> At dawn each morning last week , a procession of anxious diggers trudged five miles to the chapel in Cristalina to light a candle at the feet of St. Sebastian , praying that he would guide them to a rich strike . Many other amateurs , discouraged by the boomtown prices and the depth of the veins , were selling out . Said one : " God put the crystal near the surface , but the devil pushed it to the bottom . " As the amateurs quit , professional mining outfits were moving in to buy up their claims and get down to where the devil pushed the crystal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
