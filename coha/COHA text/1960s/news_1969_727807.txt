The Defense Department anInounced that Teske ' Force 71 -- a fleet put officially at 29 vessels and unofficially but au-. thoritatively at close to 40 ? was " proceeding south of Korea through the Tsushima Strait to the Yellow Sea , where fleet operations will continue . " It also said that the battleship New Jersey , which had been diverted to Far Eastern waters while sailing home from Vietnam waters , was now on her way home again . The ship was expected to reach Long Beach , Calif. , late next week ; In Seoul , Premier Chung II Kwon disclosed that his Government had asked the United States to strengthen its Air Force in South Korea to help defend the country . Reason Not Disclosed A Pentagon spokesman refused to say why the task force ? which was sent to The Sea of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic intelligence plane with 31 men aboard on April 15 ? was moving out of waters east of Korea to waters west of the peninsula . But there was speculation in diplomatic quarters here that the shift was influenced by Soviet complaints over the naval build-up . So large an American force so close to the vital Soviet port of Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan , it was said here , had been making the Russians uncomfortable . The shift to the Yellow Sea enables the Unites . States to placate the Russians and still protect flights off North Korea . The Defense Department declined to say how long the task force  --  which includes 3 attack aircraft carriers , one antisubmarine carrier , 3 cruisers , 22 destroyers and at least 5 submarines  --  would remain in the Yellow Sea . The department also refused comment on news reports from Tokyo today that the United States had " accomplished its objectives " in the Sea of Japan .

Wheeler , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told a special House investigating committee that the task force was " what the Navy calls a ' surge operation " one that can be maintained " for a limited period of time . " General Wheeler said that the task force was " inordinately expensive , " although he could not give any cost figures . The ships were sent to the Sea of Japan after President Nixon announced at a news conference on April 18 that reconnaissance flights over the Sea of Japan would continue and would be protected . Soviet Cooperative The Soviet role in the incident has been one of cooperation from the start . The President said at his news conference that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane and in the futile search for survivors . He also said that United States intelligence indicated that the Russians had not been aware that the North Koreans were going to attack the plane . The New York limes Aor11 27 , 1969 U.S. task force sailed out of the Sea of Japan ( 1 ) and Into the Yellow Sea ( 2 ) . Since the President 's announcement , Pentagon spokesmen have refused to say whether reconnaissance flights in international airspace off the North Korean coast have indeed been resumed . The assumption is that they have been , but the Pentagon will say only that the " President 's orders are being carried out . " First reports of the movement of the task force to the Yellow Sea today came from the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo . Those reports were later confirmed by the Defense Department , which issued the following brief statement : " Task force 71 , which has been operating in the Sea of Japan since April 20 , is proceeding south of Korea through the Tsushima Straits to the Yellow Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey is parting from the Western Pacific and is expected to return Ito the United States .
