The candidate who had most to lose from the riots in Atlanta 's Negro slums was Ellis Arnall , a polished millionaire lawyer who in 1942 wrested the governorship from the legendary Gene Talmadge . Running as an outspoken racial moderate , Arnall , now 59 , this year had to compete with five others for the Democratic nomination to succeed Governor Carl Sanders . His most formidable opposition came from segregationists , who did their utmost to exploit the specter of black power . <P> As it turned out , last week 's primary gave Arnall a 45,000-vote margin over his closest rival . His showing was all the more remarkable because in the county courthouses , which still pay fealty to Ol ' Gene 's son Herman , he is unfondly remembered as the " boy wonder " Governor who hobbled the Talmadge machine , abolished the state 's poll tax , and established a merit system for state employees . <P> Since his 211,000 votes did not constitute a clear majority , Arnall faces a runoff on Sept. 28 against Atlanta 's Lester Maddox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by closing down his Pickrick restaurant in Atlanta rather than obey the 1964 civil rights law barring racial discrimination in public accommodations . Maddox drew 166,000 votes in an unexpectedly close struggle for second place with State <P> Senator Jimmy Carter , 41 , a moderate in the Arnall mold , who had so meager a pre-primary following that people habitually referred to him as " Jimmy Who ? " As it turned out , the Arnall-Carter brand of rational race relations pulled a total of 365,000 votes , 25,000 more than Maddox and two other ardent white supremacists could raise between them . <P> <P> Arnall is an odds-on favorite to trounce Maddox in next week 's runoff . In the November election , he will run head-on into a powerhouse Republican candidate , Representative Howard ( " Bo " ) Callaway , 39 , who is also a millionaire . A states ' - righter who was elected on the tails of Barry Goldwater 's 1964 Georgia victory , Callaway is given at least an even chance of defeating Arnall , to become Georgia 's first Republican Governor since Reconstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
