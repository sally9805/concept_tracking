SCENE : The unit set represents the interior of the Casino at Monte Carlo . On the right , a corner of one of the gaming rooms . There is a roulette table with an overhanging lamp and some potted plants nearby . On the left , the bar of the Casino with two stools in front of it . In the center , the lobbies of the Casino  --  with a perspective view in depth . TIME : It is afternoon . AT RISE : Circus music is heard as the curtain rises . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) enters and goes at once to the bar . She greets the BARMAN behind the counter with a wave . He serves her at once . There is apparently no need for her to order . THE CROUPIER is seated at his table arranging chips . Now and then , he spins the ball around his wheel . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) is a striking woman with a confident bearing . She is a woman of a certain age , which means that her age is uncertain . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is elegant despite a certain flashiness in her dress and an excess of jewelry . THE CROUPIER is a man who has seen everything , but who has nevertheless managed to retain his innocence . He likes to hear himself talk . THE CROUPIER ( Automatically ) Messieurs , faites vos jeux ! Gentlemen , place your bets . Faites vos jeux , messieurs . Place your bets , gentlemen ! ( At the bar , MARIE-PAULE ( I ) tosses back her drink and with a movement of her chin orders a second . She looks across to THE CROUPIER ) p. 3 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Here I come , M'sieu Oscar ! ( She picks up the second drink as the BARMAN serves it and moves across to THE CROUPIER ) The thirty-one . THE CROUPIER ( Placing her bet ) The Thirty-one . ( He spins the wheel and throws the ball around its spin ) Rien ne va plus ! No more bets ! ( The wheel stops ) Twenty-two black , even and high . ( He rakes in the chips ) Calm today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it so , Ma'am Marie-Paule ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Placing another bet ) Three and around . THE CROUPIER ( Echoing ) Three and around . ( He spins the wheel and throws the ball . The grating hum of the ball on the spinning wheel underscores his next words ) Mind you , I 'm not complaining . You may say : the tips ! But when I have twenty people around the table , my eyes get plenty of exercise . ( The wheel stops ) Fifteen black , odd and low . ( He rakes in the chips ) But this way I relax . I think of nothing . ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) places another bet ) Same as fishing . You like fishing ? p. 4 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I never tried . THE CROUPIER You should . ( He spins the wheel and throws the ball ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And what would I do if I caught one ? Stuff it ? THE CROUPIER ( Glancing at the wheel ) Twenty-seven red , odd and high . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as thinking of nothing .  --  We 're always thinking of something even without realizing it . I read that in The Reader 's Digest . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Twenty-three , twenty-six . THE CROUPIER ( Echoing ) Twenty-three , twenty-six . Now , you may say to me that thinking you 're thinking of nothing is still thinking . Ah ! If you want to split hairs  --  . Rien ne va plus . ( He spins the wheel and throws the ball ) Did you see the paper this morning ? The woman who threw herself from a window on the Avenue Princesse Charlotte ? Why ? A charmer she met on a train . The seven-twelve . Love at first sight . She could already see the happy ending  --  ( He makes that French noise ) In the morning , he turned out to be the father of a family . Fate . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Life . p. 5 THE CROUPIER ( Highly impressed ) Life  --  as you say . Life , in my opinion , is badly made . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub up against ; all that happens and that does n't happen but which could have happened  --  it 's astonishing that there are people eighty years old . ( The wheel stops ) Thirty-two red , even and high . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Twenty-three , twenty-six again . THE CROUPIER ( He throws the ball and spins the wheel ) Take me . About seven years ago there was a lady who always came here to my table . A redhead , a little your type . ( An afterthought ) Rien ne va plus ! ( Shrugs ) What can I say ? I was hooked . Like a trout . Madly in love . Madly , Ma'am Marie-Paule . So that I 'd wake at five in the morning . To think . Ready to leave my wife , my children . Hard to believe ? I promise you , there are times when I 'm so passionate that I surprise myself ! ( The wheel stops ) The three . ( He rakes in the chips ) One morning I woke after a sleepless night  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this remark , then decides to continue ) And I said to myself  --  ( He stops as he sees MONSIEUR GASTON enter from around the side of the bar . MONSIEUR GASTON is an elderly , distinguished gentleman such as one often meets on the Riviera . He wears a yachting costume . He stops for a moment near the BARMAN and hands over his cap ) Psst ! Apropos of hooked  --  here 's yours . p. 6 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You think ? THE CROUPIER I can always feel when something 's on the end of a line . ( He makes the appropriate gesture , and greets the approaching MONSIEUR GASTON with great deference ) MONSIEUR GASTON ( to THE CROUPIER ) Bonjour , Oscar . ( He greets MARIE-PAULE ( I ) with a flourish ) Madame . ( He moves around her and takes a chair beside her ) Allow me ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Why not ? ( Monsieur GASTON seats himself and considers the table ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) The twelve . Flat . MONSIEUR GASTON The six . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) with great gallantry ) Twelve . ( He points to her ) Six . ( He points to himself ) Do you mind me being half of you ? ( THE CROUPIER spins the wheel and throws the ball ) THE CROUPIER No more bets ! Rien ne va plus ! MONSIEUR GASTON ( To MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ) Pretty weather out . A little damp for the season , perhaps . p. 7 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Good for the flowers , they say . MONSIEUR GASTON ( Pressing ) And being one  --  you should know . ( THE CROUPIER and MARIE-PAULE ( I ) exchange a look . The wheel stops ) THE CROUPIER And twelve red , even and low . ( He pushes some chips toward MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Et hop ! The good soup ! This way with the good soup ! ( Her avidity puts GASTON off somewhat . There is a slight chill . She and GASTON place new bets ) The twenty , twenty-two , flat ! ( THE CROUPIER spins the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventeen black , odd and low . ( He rakes in the chips ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Go on ! Take your odds and lows and shove ' em ! The way I 'm going , my new mink 'll never leave the forest ! ( MONSIEUR GASTON stiffens , rises , bows slightly , and leaves ) He was n't hooked for very long . THE CROUPIER May I say something ? Your language . He 's a very proper man . Suppose he 'd like to introduce you to his nieces . All countesses. p. 8 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Pss ! A man has to be trained right from the start ! Crack the whip , like in the circus : tame them ! Or keep them in a cage ! THE CROUPIER Living with my wife I lost the habit of using bad language . ( A sudden thought ) Maybe that 's why we do n't talk much any more . Good morning , Where 's the can opener ? , Good night . But I make up for it when I go fishing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doctor tells me it 's a kind of compensation . ( A pause ) Maybe so . ( A pause ) Do you like him ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Who ? THE CROUPIER ( With a gesture of his thumb ) The old rooster . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) He 's got money . THE CROUPIER ( With a sudden burst of enthusiasm ) And what money ! Vickers , Limited . In this world , marrying munitions is better than marrying love . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Yesterday Vickers went up twelve and a half points . THE CROUPIER That 's more than Swiss cheese went up . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Say what you like , M'sieu Oscar , but when you 've got a pile like that you must feel like  --  how do I know ?  --  like a statue up on a pedestal . You must feel like nothing bad could ever happen to you . That you 're safe , no worries , looked after . p. 9 THE CROUPIER Oh , yes . ( In the silence which follows he stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capital . Than can change everything in life . Now , you seem to be  --  how shall I say ?  --  quite well arranged . Your husband makes you a handsome allowance . No worries . Security . The checks come fluttering down every month . ( He laughs ) The other day my brother-in-law and I  --  we were amusing ourselves  --  trying to figure out just what it costs you  --  all this . That is to say , hotel , restaurants . You must have a pretty nice income . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) But an income ! That 's just what I do n't want it to be  --  an income . I want something solid  --  that remains . An income is nothing  --  it comes , it goes . But what does it do for your fear ? Nothing . My husband 's check every month  --  all right . But he might die  --  or change his mind  --  or go bankrupt . Without me , he 's stupid in business . And then what ? No more income , only more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I always had fear . ( THE CROUPIER rolls the ball around the wheel automatically as he watches MARIE-PAULE ( I ) . She is staring into space as she continues ) People used to say  --  that Marie-Paule , she 's not afraid of anything . Because I have the head of a lion . p. 10 THE CROUPIER Oh , do n't say that . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Why not ? A lion 's head  --  that 's handsome . Say in restaurants  --  if something does n't suit me , I send for the maitre d ' and I shake him by his gums ! ( On the other side of the stage the BARMAN leaves ) With chambermaids and lady 's maids and all that  --  they know where they stand with me . I seemed to be afraid of nothing , because that 's the impression I want to give . But the truth ? I 'm always afraid . Day and night  --  afraid of not having . THE CROUPIER No ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awful fear of not having . Of finding myself lost , without a radish ; in the streets , not knowing where to go . You look for what it is that makes people do what they do . You think you 're going to find  --  how do I know ?  --  something enormous ! And what is it ? A little fear . A stinking little fear . And some people do n't even know it exists . My whole life it 's been after me , like a wild beast . Yes , I march along like a gendarme , but always there , back of me , my shadow is trembling . ( She picks up her bag and takes out a photograph which she hands to THE CROUPIER ) Here 's how I looked when I was young . ( As she speaks this line the lobby in the center of the stage rolls away and is replaced by a modest kitchen containing a table and a stove . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) sits plucking hairs from her legs . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finishes it on MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) p. 11 THE CROUPIER Ah , a beautiful piece of equipment . ( He outlines her figure in the air ) My compliments . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) It was in Carcassonne . Y'know it ? THE CROUPIER I 've heard of it  --  I understand it has some fine old ruins . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You ca n't make a living out of old ruins ! ( MARIE-PAULE 'S MOTHER comes into the kitchen , carrying a heavy bucket of coal . She puts it down and wipes her hands on her apron . She is breathing heavily . She is a small woman , worn out before her time . At the gambling table MARIE-PAULE ( I ) stands up slowly and brings her hand to her mouth . She stares straight ahead , seeing in memory ) MARIE-PAULE 'S MOTHER ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) Up already ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 've got a shorthand class . THE CROUPIER ( Gently and with great feeling ) Your mamma ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're too heavy , these buckets . Look at my hands I used to have pretty hands . Your pretty hands , your father always said . When we get married , you 're going to have a maid ! p. 12 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Bookkeeper , he was . MARIE-PAULE 'S MOTHER But your father 's right . We must be careful . No debts . Save a little . You never know what can happen . ( Bitterly ) Marie-Paule , let me tell you . Put up with no matter what in life . No matter what . But never live without a maid , you hear what I 'm saying ? Never live without a maid . ( She moves to the stove and pushes back a strand of hair with the back of her hand ) ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) gets up and crosses to her . She timidly waves her hand . Her mother does not see her ) ( The kitchen rolls off and with it THE MOTHER and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Buckets , brooms ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar , takes a glass and moves gradually back toward THE CROUPIER ) You 'd think that having honest parents you 'd turn out honest yourself . Would n't you ? The hell you do ! Honest like them ?  --  There never were such ! Known for it all over Carcassonne . Three francs too much change from the butcher , the next day off went my mother just to it back again . And out of all their honesty , what I got handed down to me was fear ! About my mother , though , I remember a lot of things : her hair , her hat , a little toque , nothing !  --  But it was a hat like only your mother wears . One day there was a fair  --  I must have been what ?  --  six years old . I got lost in the crowd , my father found me , led me back to mamma , who  --  so she could try and see me  --  climbed upstairs at Berchon 's the pastry shop . Then she saw me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice breaks . She has reached the gambling table . She sits ) It 's silly  --  to this day , I have to cry  --  . And the time she tried to smoke a cigarette . And she got laughing . Laughing  --  . On the table was the bottle of Benedictine , and there was our cousin from Perpignan  --  . But all that  --  - psss ! just something away off in the dark , and what 's left is that thing she said ? That one little rule ? Put up with no matter what , but not to live without a maid. That started the fear . I dropped my shorthand course in a hurry . I wanted to right away earn my living . ( In the center of the stage , a new inset rolls on . A clothing store in Carcassonne . A modest little shop with a counter and a mirror . A row of hanging suits at the back . To the left is the entrance to the street ; to the right , a store-room . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ROGER is fitting a jacket onto a customer . The jacket is plainly too large . ROGER is a man in his thirties , good-looking , husky , vain and jovial ) p. 13 ROGER Too big ? That ? Marie-Paule , come and see . M'sieu things this jacket is too big . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) comes out from behind the counter to get a better look at the fitting ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Not at all . That fullness  --  that 's what it should have . ROGER ( To THE CUSTOMER ) Did I make her say that ? No . And what counts is the opinion of women , particularly about clothes . As a matter of fact , she usually likes snug fits . We argue about it all the time . I tell her  --  snug fits are out . THE CUSTOMER ( Stubbornly ) Sleeves too long . ROGER Then why are your arms falling out of them ? One moment . ( He goes behind the client and sets the jacket ) Now there 's a beautiful sleeve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were the victim of a hold-up ) Now there 's a gesture you must make often . THE CUSTOMER ( Unhappy ) All this material . ROGER ( Swiftly ) This is tweed , you understand , fine tweed . Tweed is made full . For fullness . Otherwise , it 's not tweed . p. 14 THE CUSTOMER ( Holding the coat out from his body and looking into it ) I could have a few friends to dinner in here . ROGER ( Forcing a laugh ) Oh , that 's funny , M'sieu . Really droll . ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) Did you hear that ? ( To THE CUSTOMER ) Believe me , M'sieu , with your wit and that jacket , you 're going to go far . ( He continues to set the jacket ) Imagine it , to stop right into it like that . Nowadays with this American cut in ready made clothes , they do miracles . THE CUSTOMER Is that what this is , the American cut ? ROGER Absolutely ( A pause ) THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , you 'll see . ( He leads THE CUSTOMER to the street door . THE CUSTOMER disappears , ROGER smoothing the back fo the jacket for the last time . ROGER comes back into the shop displaying a ten thousand franc note ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Enraptured ) M'sieu Roger ! ROGER Not bad , eh ? ( Happily , he hands Marie-Paule ( II ) the money . She turns on her way back to her place behind the counter . As she does so , he gives her an exuberant slap on the bottom . She wriggles away ) Go ahead , ring it up . ( ROGER goes to the backdrop and measures a jacket which is hanging there . Meanwhile he sings " The Song of India " ) Oh , land of lovely diamonds by the score , And pearls in flowing never ending store , Oh In - di - a , that I adore ! ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) laughs ) p. 15 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) M'sieu Roger , you 're marvelous ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE CROUPIER ( Impartial ) I must say that for his type  --  MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I began to forget my fear . Smooth as he was , in a way , he gave me confidence . ( With a touch of nostalgia ) That Roger ! Oh , my God ! ( Reasonably ) You have to understand , to a woman , her first man is like getting a diploma ! I said to myself , now that one I must have ! THE CROUPIER But it was n't difficult , was it ? ( He looks her over ) With all you had , plus your willingness  --  MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And the heat . Remember it was August ! All day long , the two of us simmering in there . What astonishes me , not that I think back , is how long it took us . ( She speaks directly to ROGER ) What took you so long ? ROGER ( Replying to her ) I do n't know . I thought maybe you would n't want to . MARIE-PAULE ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atomizer from behind the counter and uses it on himself . Meanwhile , MARIE-PAULE ( I ) crosses to the bar and sits up on a stool to watch . ROGER goes over to MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and embraces her from behind ) p. 16 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Put your hands down , please ! ROGER Gladly . ( He slides his hands down  --  way down ) THE CROUPIER Not so bashful , this one , eh ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Careful ! Someone 'll see . The baker . ROGER Then come here . ( He takes her wrist and leads her swiftly through the passage into the stockroom ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) In the stockroom ! That 's where I made my debut ! With the jackets hanging down . Do n't talk to me about moonlight ! THE CROUPIER With me it was an outdoor event . In an open square , I remember . She was English . What a cold I got ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) At first ? I did n't look ahead . I took every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . If it had n't been for his wife  --  THE CROUPIER He was married ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Up to his belly-button . With two children . THE CROUPIER Just like me ! Small world , eh ? All at once  --  three grandchildren . You would n't believe it , would you ? The oldest one is five . Would you like to see some pictures ? ( He gets out his wallet ) The other day , you know what he came out with ? ( A bell rings off . THE CROUPIER stops as MARIE-PAULE ( I ) brushes aside the snapshot . The bell rings once more . Through the street door MADAME ROGER enters the shop . She looks surprised ) p. 17 MADAME ROGER Roger ! ( A pause ) Roger ! ( A pause ) Mademoiselle Marie-Paule ! ( ROGER hurries out of the stockroom adjusting his necktie ) ROGER My lamb ! What a nice surprise ! MADAME ROGER Where were you ? ROGER In the stockroom  --  putting things in order . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( ROGER gulps ) Suppose a customer comes in ? Look at you . You 're all dusty . ( She brushes him off ) Why pay a girl if she ca n't take care of things in the stockroom ? Or at least you could take turns in there . ROGER ( Embarrassed ) Well , you know  --  MADAME ROGER She 'll learn . Wo n't you , Mademoiselle ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) nods ) Good . Now from now on please see that you take care of everything . That 's no work for my husband . ( She discovers a pair of trousers lying on the counter ) Look at this  --  cluttering up the place . ( She throws them to MARIE-PAULE ( II ) who carries them off ) Oh , you ! Do n't be late tonight . We 're having kidney . Hmmmn ? ( This is spoken to ROGER ) p. 18 ROGER ( Passionately ) Hmmmn ! ( THEY exchange a swift , married kiss . ROGER leads his wife to the street entrance . MARIE-PAULE ( II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) . He shrugs and begins to whistle " The Song of India " ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) You know the type , self-satisfied . I began to think of myself , to think ahead . ROGER ( With a glance toward the stockroom ) Coming ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No . ROGER ( Amazed ) What , my coco ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'm not your coco . ROGER But this is our time . The slack hour . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'm sick of it ! Making love in the stockroom . Like animals . ROGER Animals do n't make love in stockrooms . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And what if your wife comes in ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Hmm ? What 'll we look like then ? ROGER ( TO MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) She wo n't come . p. 19 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) She was n't supposed to come the other day either . She and her kidneys . ROGER Come on , coco . MARIE-PAULE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( To OSCAR ) The next day , it began again . ROGER Please MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Tapping her chin ) Ding , dong ! ROGER What is it , for God 's sake ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I want to live with you . ROGER I 'm already married . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Get unmarried . ROGER Divorce ? ( He takes her by the chin ) Are you jealous ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Pulling away ) Do n't ! ROGER Listen  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I want to live with you . ( She throws her arms about his neck ) I want to live with you . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Day after day , I kept hammering away ! ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and ROGER separate ) p. 20 ROGER ( Standing near the stockroom door ) Come on . One big step . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Haughtily ) I 'm busy . ROGER Come have a look . I put down a nice pile of overcoats . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Mocking him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of these days I 'm going to put in a sofa . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Looking up at the ceiling ) A sofa . ROGER ( Pleading ) Little chick . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) A little chick should have a little nest ! ROGER Exactly . The sofa . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Shove your sofa ! ROGER ( Losing patience ) We ca n't go to a hotel , can we ? In Carcassonne ? Where everybody knows me ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All right , then . What your wife said . Go in there one at a time . ROGER What ? ( He gets it ) Oh , sarcastic . Why do n't we  --  p. 21 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 've had enough ! Night after night you going home to your house , your wife , your slippers , your kidneys . ROGER Not very night kidneys . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And me ? Sitting alone in my room . Thinking of you having your real wife and  --  ROGER ( Amused ) You are jealous ! MARIE-PAULE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she be ? Maybe I ought to go and ask her ! ( She starts out purposefully . ROGER runs after her and stops her ) ROGER ( In a panic ) No ! Wait ! ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and ROGER return to the shop ) What 's the matter ? Is something wrong ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) Very clever boy . ROGER What do you want ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I want to live with you . I want my own house , my own kitchen , my own double bed . ROGER And what about your father and mother ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) We could go to Paris . p. 22 ROGER And what about money ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You have your wife 's dowry . ROGER ( With dignity ) You expect me to get a divorce and take my wife 's dowry at the same time ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) First take the dowry and then divorce . That even gives her some grounds . ROGER It 's in the bank in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ( She goes toward him ) You realize we 've never spent one whole night together ? And we could if only you were n't so  --  ( She embraces him ) Come on . ( HE lifts her up still holding the embrace and starts toward the stockroom ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No , it 's too far ! ROGER Two steps ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Roger ! ( THEY drop down behind the counter ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Take it away ! ( The clothing store set rolls off ) The next day we left for Paris . And the dowry went with us . And there was one wife that from then on thought twice before underestimating a working girl ! ( In the center , Paris is now represented by a screen in a restaurant . In front of it there is a table with a bucket of champagne and a lamp with a pink shade ) ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and ROGER enter and will presently sit at the table ) p. 23 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) One look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROUPIER A beautiful city , from what I hear . My brother-in-law 's been there . ROGER ( Looking off ) What a sight . Look at that traffic . ( He turns into the restaurant ) And look in here . See the little lamp on each table ? Is n't that civilized ? ( THEY sit and he picks up the menu ) Now what do you say ? Lobster ? ( He sees the price ) Holy  --  ! You know what they do when you order lobster ? They bring you a little dish to wash your hands in . At least they 're supposed to . Let 's order lobster just to see if they do it . ( He puts down the menu ) You know where we 're going tonight ? Place Pigalle . You know what they 've got there ? Naked women . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What do you see me wearing at night ? And did n't you ever have time to look at your wife ? ROGER It 's not the same thing . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here they have feathers in the back . And spangles in the front . p. 24 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh , then they 're not so naked ? ROGER ( Giving up ) You do n't want to understand . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) But all we found were Russian dancers  --  fully dressed . That interested him , too . When we got back to the hotel he 'd try out some of the steps . But no naked women  --  ( ROGER and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) have left the restaurant , and have moved downstage A street rolls on behind them , complete with kiosk and resplendent doorman ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Ask him . ROGER You think so ? ( ROGER approaches THE DOORMAN and slips him a tip ) Could you be so kind as to recommend a show ? A real Parisian show . THE DOORMAN ( He thinks ) What about the Comedie Francaise ? ( He takes a folder from his pocket ) Tonight it 's Cyrano . That 's classic , but people seem to like it . ROGER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see something a little more  --  ( He indicates pantomimically what he means ) THE DOORMAN What about the Folies Bergeres ? p. 25 ROGER ( Irritated ) What do I look like ? A tourist ? ( He returned to Marie-Paule ( II ) and makes a helpless gesture ) You see ? ( THE DOORMAN has left . From the other side , on comes one of those shady looking characters one frequently meets in the Place Pigalle . This one wears a velour hat with the brim turned down all around , a loud Prince de Galles jacket , and an ascot ) THE SHADY ONE Madame et M'sieu , taking a little walk ? Why not ? Paris by night ? Pigalle ! ( Secretively he lays his index finger against his cheek below the eye ) Would Madame et M'sieu like to see something soin-soin ? Something especially special ? ROGER Well , we were looking for  --  THE SHADY ONE Attractions , curiosities ? Something bizarre ? Juicy movies ? ROGER ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) At last ! ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , would you ? THE SHADY ONE Not right on me , no . But if it 's naked women that interest you  --  To find anything more naked , I do n't know where you 'd have to go . To Polynesia , maybe , to Tierra Del Fuego , to Las Vegas . If Madame et M'sieu will do me the honor . ( Behind them a new set has rolled into view . A corner of a cabaret . THE SHADY ONE escorts them to a table and THEY sit . From offstage , Latin-America music . THE SHADY ONE points off ) p. 26 THE SHADY ONE Naked enough for you ? Or would you like them to remove their skins ? ( ROGER looks off and gulps . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) is bored ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) In Heaven , he was . We had to go back there every night ! THE CROUPIER Think of that . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I can tell you  --  what I got out of it  --  a nice case of indigestion . ( Along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIE-PAULE ( I ) watch the off-stage show ) All those behinds ! White . Pale like chrysanthemums . And how they rocked ; it was enough to make you seasick ! THE CROUPIER There 's not much variety when it comes to behinds . Once you 've seen one  --  or two  --  I mean to say , they lack soul . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I 'll have to argue that , M'sieu Oscar . The soul is everywhere . ( THE CROUPIER and MARIE-PAULE ( I ) laugh together . The music increases in volume ) ROGER ( Looking off with enthusiasm ) Look ! ( His hands are outlining figures ) Look at those chests ! ( With sudden excitement he jumps up , points two fingers off , and sings out ) Ti ! Ti ! p. 27 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All right , toreador , calm down . I do n't understand you . They 're not even attractive , these women . ROGER Well , there are some  --  I wo n't say . But look at that third one . MARIE-PAULE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alike . ROGER The third from the left . The blonde with the basket MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Disdainfully ) That 's not a woman , that 's a tube of toothpaste . Why , I 've got more than she has . ROGER ( Appeasing her ) Of course you have ! ( Flatteringly ) Otherwise , why would I have picked you ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) That 's what he 'd come to . To believe he had picked me . Men , they 're ridiculous . I tell you if women were half as stupid life would be a peculiar kind of bullfight . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Well ? ROGER Well , what ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You still have n't explained what 's so fascinating around here . You can see me the same way every night . And save your money . p. 28 ROGER Here , I do n't know them . It 's more  --  educational . And then , everybody else watching at the same time . It gives it meaning . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I ) Yes , all those faces watching in the shadows pale , like the behinds . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and ROGER get up and walk toward the footlights ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Do n't you think we 've had enough of this ? Your wife 's money is n't going to last forever . Should n't you start looking for work ? ROGER Let me handle it , will you ? You think I 'm doing nothing ? I 've been studying the situation , the possibilities . ( A sound ) As soon as I see my way clear  --  ( He simulates the shooting of an arrow )  --  Tsac ! B lls-eye ! Now , the next thing on our program is to pay a little visit to the Palais de Glace . ( Behind them the nightclub has rolled off and has been replaced by a suggestion of the Palais de Glace . Appropriate music . The treadmill stage now continues to roll without stopping . A pretty young SKATER in a white skater 's costume skates on ) ROGER Look ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Later . ROGER I 'll be too old later ! ( He sits down on the floor , rips off his shoes , and begins to put on skates ) It 's time I got into sports . I 'm getting rusty . ( He calls out to the skater , after sending her a kiss ) Hey ! What do you feel like , doing that like a swan ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( In despair ) Roger ! ( But ROGER has joined the skater and skates beautifully . After a moment , MARIE-PAULE ( II ) backs away to watch him ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) He was gifted . Have you ever noticed ? There are men like that . Gifted for everything that 's useless . ( ROGER and his PARTNER skate off ) THE CROUPIER That 's so true . Do n't look any further than my brother-in-law . He 's a  --  well , you ca n't call him a stamp collector  --  he is stamp collecting its very self . He 'll recognize a stamp for you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having heard him ) That was the day I began to see through him . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Roger ! ( ROGER skates back on , holding his partner up in a competition pose ) p. 30 ROGER Look at me ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) The money ! It 's running out ! ROGER Do n't worry . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) The kind of job you can get when you 're half a million francs ahead is not the kind you settle for when you have n't got a sausage . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) That was correct , I think . That idea . THE CROUPIER In my opinion  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( To the skating ROGER ) And what about the divorce ? ROGER ( Waltzing with his skating partner ) What 's there to do ? I 'm in the wrong . She 's in the right . I ca n't begin it . She has to . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) He was good at postponing things . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) But what if she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she loves me ? ( He sings in tune to the waltz ) Na na na na na . ( One more spin and he skates off with his partner . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) holding his shoes , runs off after them MARIE-PAULE ( I ) stands up , takes a few steps towards the center of the stage , and makes a menacing gesture , with the back of her arm , toward ROGER ) p. 31 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You see that ? You 'd think that running away with one woman and stealing another one 's money would have grown him up a little . Not him . It actually made him younger . Youth ! You can have it . Seeing him there with that skater it suddenly hit me  --  what he was . A kid . I was counting on a kid . THE CROUPIER ( Gravely ) I must say , in your situation , skating was not the answer . ( In the center of the stage a modest hotel room has rolled on . The two customary doors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the door to an armoire . Between the two a bed on which MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and ROGER are asleep . In front of the bed a chair on which ROGER 'S jacket is hanging . An alarm clock goes off ) ROGER ( Sleepily ) Hello ! Hello ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) It 's the alarm , idiot . ROGER Oh la la . Nine o'clock . I better bounce . ( But he lies there , inert ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Fine . At that rate , you 'll be on time for tomorrow morning . ROGER All right , all right . ( He gets up and begins to dress while whistling " The Song of India . " MARIE-PAULE ( II ) sits up in bed , arranges herself comfortably and watches him ) p. 32 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) He 'd finally found a job . As a salesman . Silverware . ROGER You 'll see , old coco . This is going to be all right . I understand that on good days , you can make as much as six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand multiplied by thirty wait a second  --  ( He calculates )  --  two hundred and fifty a month , MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Coolly ) Two hundred and ten . ROGER All right . Still pretty good . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And that 's counting Sundays . ROGER Who wants to sleep with an adding machine ? ( He turns his back on her and finishes combing his hair ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Already for me he did n't exist any more . Like a hornet buzzing around in my room . A man , once you decide to drop him  --  for all he can still tell you , is like the birds in the trees : a little twitter that annoys you , that 's all . ROGER ( Taking a bill out of his wallet ) Here , I 'm leaving you five hundred francs for your lunch . Enjoy yourself . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) With five hundred francs ? I 'll try . ( ROGER comes to the bed and kisses MARIE-PAULE ( II ) , lightly . He hesitates for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He moves to embrace her ) p. 33 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Pushing him away ) No , no . Not now . Go to work . ROGER Come on , ten minutes more or less No ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No . ROGER ( Standing up ) You act like we 're married . ( He leaves , whistling his song . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) waits for a moment , then exchanges a giddy laugh with MARIE-PAULE ( I ) . She turns to the wall , picks up her shoe , and with its heel , knocks three times on the partition ) ODILON Present ! ( A moment later , through the main door , ODILON comes in , wearing a loud robe and whistling the Toreador song from " Carmen . " ODILON is somewhat older than ROGER . A man of the world . Sophisticated . Parisian ) ODILON ( Gaily ) Is he gone ? Our friend , the knife-grinder ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No , he 's under the bed . ( ODILON starts ) ODILON What ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I 'm joking . ODILON A fine joke . With my heart condition . ( He feels his pulse , as he goes toward the alarm clock which stands on the night table ) No second hand , how can I do it ? p. 34 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Do what ? ODILON Take my pulse ( He does so ) Seems normal . ( He begins to take off his wrapper ) Hup ! I almost forgot my Liverine . ( He takes a bottle from his pocket and swallows a pill ) Every day before ten o'clock . Doctor 's orders . ( He takes off his robe . He is in his trousers and shirt . He goes to the door , locks it and comes back to the bed rubbing his hands together . He looks at her with a confident smile . SHE stretches a catlike stretch ) Well , now , little lady-of-the-house  --  what about it ? Are you in the market for a little ecstasy ? ( SHE responds coyly . HE makes his next move , a leap . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a loud knock . A silence . Another knock . ODILON stands up ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Who is it ? ROGER The President of the Republic ! ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and ODILON look at each other . ODILON looks ill . He is rubbing his chest in the region of his heart . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) shoves him over to the armoire and puts him inside it ) Hurry up ! I left my wallet . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) One minute ! I was doing my exercises . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) goes to the door and opens it . She has only had time to put one shoe on . ROGER comes in ) p. 35 ROGER Exercises ? ( He moves into the room , no more than slightly suspicious ) You need rest  --  not exercises . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) points to the armoire ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Chut ! ROGER What ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) He 's in there . ROGER ( Lowering his voice ) He 's in there ? ( He walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Who 's in there ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Papa . ROGER Your father ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) He want 's to drag me back home . ROGER But what 's he doing in there ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) He does n't want to see you . ROGER What have I ever done to him ? All right , I 'll ask him ! ( He moves toward the closet . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks at him hopefully ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I was giving him his chance  --  one more chance  --  to see if for once he could be a man , not a boy . ( But , near the armoire , ROGER has already stopped . Undecided , he turns back to her ) p. 36 ROGER Do you think it 's the thing to do ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) That 's up to you . ROGER ( Moving back to her ) But maybe a girl can handle her father better than a man can . THE CROUPIER ( To MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ) Well , now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be quiet ) ROGER ( Speaking toward the closet in a raised voice ) But make it clear to him I understand his point of view . ( He yells ) I 'm getting a divorce and I 'm going to marry you . ( Suddenly suspicious ) Exercises . You said you were doing your exercises . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Of course  --  I know you , how violent you are . I had to get it to you gently about Papa  --  or you 'd have broken down the door . ROGER Yes . ( He embraces her ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Please . ROGER What ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Not right in front of my father . ROGER Oh , of course . I forgot all about him . That 's how I am . I touch a girl and I forget everything . All right , I 'm going . I 'm going . ( He takes another bill out of his wallet and hands it to her ) Here , take him to lunch . ( In a bass voice ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard. ) p. 37 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Go on , you coconut . ( ROGER laughs and leaves , with a farewell wave at the armoire ) ODILON ( Coming out of the closet , breathless ) Oh , no ! Thank you very much . This is not for me . What a shock ! And at what a moment ! I felt it right in my solar plexus ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Take a pill . ODILON Yes . Joke . It 's no joke to me . ( Overcome , he sits on the bed and feels his pulse ) Have you got a watch ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) offers her wrist on which she is wearing a wristwatch . HE looks at it ) Again no second hand . ( He throws her wrist away ) What the hell 's the idea saying I 'm your father ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Of course . A mistake . I should have said , it 's Monsieur Odilion from the room next door . And what 's he doing in the closet ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have said nothing . But , of course , women never think of that , of saying nothing ( He considers his physical condition for a moment ) Well , that stopped my whistle  --  that business . ( He makes that sound ) Zero . Tomorrow you come into my room . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks at him ) p. 38 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I was feeling my way . I was groping . ( With a gesture toward the roulette table ) Men  --  it 's like with the numbers there . How do you know which one to play ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All right . I 'll come to your room . But first you better find one in another hotel . ODILON Why ? This is convenient . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No . I want to go live with you . ODILON Now there 's an original idea ! ( He looks at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) thoughtfully ) And what about our friend , the knife-grinder ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Hup ! ( She makes a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what you want  --  ( THEY embrace as the hotel room rolls off to be replaced by a slightly better hotel room . There is a canary in a cage . ODILON leads MARIE-PAULE ( II ) into the room , putting on a jacket ) Cosy , no ? Right on the avenue . A balcony . Can you see the trees out there ? There 's something in chlorophyll , I 'm sure of it . ( He takes a deep breath ) Now , allow me to present my little canary . His name is Cat . I call him Cat . p. 39 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why ? ODILON It gives him confidence . ( He points off ) And there 's the  --  excuse me  --  bathroom . You know what I love ? Hygiene . And I had them put in a hotplate so you can cook . Good ? With my liver all that bistro food is beginning to win . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) He was a barman , Odilon . THE CROUPIER I thought so . He looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rue Vavin . He did n't start work until five o'clock . So , every afternoon , from two to four  --  walking ! Doctor 's orders . ( ODILON and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) take a few steps toward the footlights . He is breathing deeply . A sort of exercise . Behind them a new inset of Paris appears . A square with a statue of Marshal Ney ) ODILON Now , this is what I call air ! Breathe . ( SHE does so ) Deeper . That 's better . That 's what it 's here for  --  to be breathed . Look over there . Marshal Ney . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Looking about ) I do n't see anybody . ODILON ( Impatiently ) The statue ! p. 40 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh . ( THEY step over to it ) ODILON And when you think they shot him . A marshal . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why ? ODILON ( Knowingly ) Question of discipline . He refused to put Napoleon into an iron cage . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ODILON ( With a vague gesture ) Question of politics . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and HE take a few steps ) ODILON ( continuing ) And after they shot him , an Englishman on horseback jumped over him . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Waht is all this ? ODILON History ! Those English ! That , and then after that  --  Joan of Arc . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) When it came to history , he knew it right from the beginning . Especially about Napoleon . THE CROUPIER He was an interesting fellow , Napoleon . ( A pause ) The Empire  --  ODILON ( Seized with a sudden fury ) Oh , if I could only get my hands on him ! p. 41 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Who ? ODILON The Duke of Wellington . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why , what did he do ? ODILON Plenty ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh . ODILON It was not a fair fight . Did you ever hear of such a stupid place for a battle ? Waterloo ! ( Behind them a set representing the tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His tomb . Napoleon 's . ( THEY move to the balustrade and look down ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Is he down there ? ODILON ( Gravely ) He is down there . What a man ! Nothing ever surprised him . That was his strength . One day he came to a bridge . At Arcole . The Bridge of Arcole . You know what he did ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Crossed it ? ODILON ( Stopped ) Oh , you knew about that . Did you know about his vest ? About the little pockets in his vest , lined with suede , for his snuff ? He took snuff . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Suspiciously ) Napoleon ? p. 42 ODILON It 's history . ( The tomb is replaced by their room ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And then one day a Friday , I remember . ODILON ( Brusquely ) Listen . The two of us , from now on  --  it 's finished . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What ? ( She sits on the bed , stunned ) MARIE-PAULE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ODILON ( Plowing on ) Finished , that 's all . Things ca n't go on forever , can they ? Well , so it 's finished . I 'm sorry . There were some good times ahead of us still . But I 've been offered the bar of a big hotel in Cairo . Shepherd 's . I ca n't refuse that . Cairo , that 's something different from the rue Vavin . So , on Monday  --  ( He makes a pushing sound )  --  I 'm off . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Monday ? And you tell me today ? How long 've you been working on this ? ODILON As long as it was n't settled I thought I better not spoil things . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Impetuously ) I 'm going with you . p. 43 ODILON ( Firmly ) No , no . ( He sits down beside her ) Listen . Egypt , the Egyptians , the climate  --  with my liver . Sorry , not for me . If I go , it 's only to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . A bar of my own . I can see it  --  rue de Berri , that neighborhood . With the lights in little glass bunches of grapes . Intimate . It can be done . With my connections . In Cairo , in three years , I can pile up enough  --  if I economize . And to economize , I have to go alone . If not , I know how it 'll turn out . Twenty years go by  --  and I 'm still there . The pyramids forever . No thanks ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) lowers her head sadly while ODILON makes a few awkward attempts to comfort her ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Shall I tell you something ? That day was the luckiest day of my whole life ; it taught me a lesson . To count on one man is like swinging on a rotten branch , You have to have two , at least . For two branches to rot at the same time  --  very rare . Think of it . Odilon , with his hours , left me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And of all things I could have done in Paris  --  wht did I do ? I went to the movies . THE CROUPIER What 's wrong with that ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Everything ! We 're not put on earth to be going to the movies . We 're here to look out for ourselves , to see what 's going on , to pile up a little security . Strike while the iron is warm , always remembering it never stays warm very long . Odilon , he saw what was going on , and very nicely looked out for himself . p. 44 ODILON ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You understand my idea ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Sadly ) Yes . ODILON Who knows ? In about three years , when I get back , if everything works out  --  we might even get glued together again . That would suit me . No fooling . We 'd have this bar  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Still sad ) Yes . ODILON ( Worriedly ) What do you think you 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything . What do you care ? Maybe I 'll go down to Cairo . Hang around Shepherd 's Bar and see what happens . ODILON Nothing will happen . Egyptians are not so interested in it . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh , only Egyptians in your bar ? ODILON ( Irritated ) Look . Ca n't we break it up as friends ? Nicely ? Here , I 'm leaving you thirty thousand francs . For luck . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Instantly ) Sixty . ODILON Thirty . That 's all I can do . I 've had expenses . Equipment . A box for my different medicines and pills , lined with aluminum . The prices of everything these days . So , thirty . But , I 'll tell you what , I 'm going to leave you the canary . p. 45 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Bitterly ) Just what I need . ODILON He 's good company . ( He goes to the cage and speaks to the canary ) Is n't that right , old fatty ? ( To MARIE-PAULE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd come home at night , and tell him all my little troubles . Tchip-tchip-tchip ! I 'd like to take him along with me , but the climate . ( He looks at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) for some time ) Listen , here 's an idea . This afternoon , if you want to , we 'll go to Chatou 's . I know the boss , Monsieur Alphonse . He might take you on  --  as a hostess . Who knows ? You might make good . You 're a type does n't appeal to everybody , but when you do  --  . What the hell  --  look at me . You got me ! ( He grabs her , a farewell whirl in mind , but SHE repulses him . The set changes to Chatou 's , a nightclub . There are three tables . At each one a patron and at the two on either end , a hostess . The first one is IRMA , a tough , fat beauty . The other one is MAURICETTE , a little cat type . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another is corpulent and jovial . The third , alone in the center , is depressed . MONSIEUR ALPHONSE , the boss , is behind the bar reading a copy of Paris Turf . From offstage , some lively , early jazz . The two COUPLES get up and begin to dance the Charleston . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) comes in quickly , makes contact with the lone patron and in a moment they join the dance , too . The music ends and all three couples resume their places . Music from offstage continues and what follows is a montage of dialogue ) p. 46 MAURICETTE Come on , buy me some champagne ! THE FIRST PATRON I do n't like this weather . I like it hot in the summer and cold in the winter . IRMA Where 're my slippers ? They 're floating around here somewheres . THE SECOND PATRON You come from Carcassonne ? MONSIEUR ALPHONSE It ; s not the money . I 'd just like the satisfaction of a winner for once . THE THIRD PATRON No , I 've never been here before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first man with four hands I ever met ! MAURICETTE Nagasaki . That 's the place I 'd like to go . A client of mine 's been telling me about it . He says it 's the place . THE SECOND PATRON And wonderful old ruins . Is n't that what it 's famous for , Carcassonne ? MONSIEUR ALPHONSE Number three . Distant Princess . She 's not a horse , she 's a ballet dancer . IRMA What can I do ? My feet swell up . MAURICETTE ( Sighing ) Well , that 's life . THE FIRST PATRON Ah , yes . p. 47 IRMA Oh , well . MONSIEUR ALPHONSE ( To Irma ) You push things , that 's your trouble . With a client , you have to give him a few minutes to catch his breath . IRMA With the price of butter what it is ? THE FIRST PATRON Ah , yes . THE SECOND PATRON ( Stretching ) Oh , God . THE THIRD PATRON ( After a pause ) This is some place . MAURICETTE And every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jazz ) THE THIRD PATRON And I say there is such a thing as a soul ! Anybody want to bet ? MAURICETTE Do n't get excited . THE SECOND PATRON ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) How about it ? ( There is a pause . Time is suspended . EVERYONE looks at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) , waiting for her reply . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks at MARIE-PAULE ( I ) who has also been watching her . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) nods slowly ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All right . Next door . ( THE THREE PATRONS , IRMA and MAURICETTE rise and raise their glasses ) p. 48 THE FIRST PATRON Happy birthday , Mademoiselle ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And kiss mine , M'sieu ! ( There is a burst of jazz during which Chatou 's rolls off . It is replaced by a room in the small hotel next door . This contains a bed , a dressing table and a mirror . The door at the back opens , a CHAMBERMAID ushers in MARIE-PAULE ( II ) followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar , I can tell you , the first time , that made an impression ! The man  --  I 've forgotten what he was like . But I can still see that room . Rue de Ponthier , it was . ( THE PATRON stands quietly near the bed . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) has approached the mirror and studies herself in it . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) moves to her and stands behind her looking into both faces in the mirror ) Is this you ? You here ? ( To THE CROUPIER ) In the mirror I could see him standing there behind me . This man . I knew if I asked him his name , he 'd make one up , or tell me to mind my own business . This stranger in the dark , this shadow  --  who was going to be  --  what ?  --  my lover ? You do n't call that a lover . ( She moves slowly to the bar and sits . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) turns to face the PATRON ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) How about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 's that ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What do you think this is , The Salvation Army ? THE SECOND PATRON ( Grudgingly ) Four ( The lights black out except for a spot from below on MARIE-PAULE ( I ) at the bar . After a moment the lights come back on again . The set is unchanged but the room at the center is deserted ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Shadows that 's what they were , M'sieu Oscar  --  shadows . Maybe that 's why you get used to it so fast . The first one  --  that still does something to me . The second ? ( She makes a sound and a gesture of hard resignation ) You went out of Chatou 's , got to the hotel , up the staircase that wound round like a corkscrew . The halls that led nowhere . The carpets . The maid  --  Suzanne or Adele depending what day it was . " I 'm giving you room fourteen , Mademoiselle Marie-Paule . " ( At the back of the inset , the door opens . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATRON . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) goes immediately to the mirror ; HE stands by the bed . THEY face one another but stand quite still as MARIE-PAULE ( I ) continues ) So then begins Operation Shadow You 'd say , to go to bed together  --  a man and a woman  --  that 's real  --  nothing more real . Yes ? Bull ! It 's all quiet , the room starts to close in , and in front of the mirror there are n't two people any more , only two bodies  --  shifting around , drifting toward each other like a couple of jellyfish . Yes , jellyfish ! Groping . Looking at each other without seeing Funny , I was thinking about it the other day , watching that film about life under the sea . ( SHE moves slowly into the inset walking between THE PATRON and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) . She moves about the room as though it were indeed the bottom of the sea ) The bottom of the sea , I tell you , is a lot like this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this are the last quiet place left in the world . Now and then a sound in the hall , slow and soft , like a fish gliding by . The light  --  dim , to make everything look a little better . The clock slows down . There 's less air . You get the feeling you 're going on . If you screamed , nobody would hear you  --  but your scream might split the walls . You 're here just by accident : You belong in some other place . Or is it happening to two other people ? Not him , not me . Like two jellyfish , I tell you  --  together for no more than a moment : one stirring , the other staring at the ceiling and yawning . And between the two  --  phfft !  --  empty feeling , floating thoughts . Because there is n't anything left to say . Because finally you 're asking yourselves  --  both of you  --  what the hell 's all this wrestling about , anyway ? Two or three gestures , hardly finished , already forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else you 've done . Words that are careful not to mean anything  --  that steer clear of what you feel  --  and wriggle away like eels ! p. 50 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Mechanically ) Where 'll we go ? THE FOURTH PATRON Wherever you want . Any ideas ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I know a nice quiet spot . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Why not say hotel ? A hostess never says hotel . Manners . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What about my little present ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Why say present ? And why little ? When you mean big . ( She shrugs ) Words , skirting around what they mean to say . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'll be nice . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Lifting her shoulders ) Nice . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Reeling it off like a learned lesson ) My big wolf . My little wolf . My rabbit . My sweet . My naughty . Pet . Cabbage . Cat . Love cat . Tom cat . Handsome . Big one . Little one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lover . Louse . Sweetmeat . Sweetheart . Rough one . Smooth one . Wild one . Cowboy . Sad one . Indian . Baby . Big wolf . Little wolf . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Vote for one . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You know what today is ? My birthday . p. 51 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) That was my own idea , the birthday . It worked . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) So what 's a big cat going to give a little mouse for her birthday ? Huh ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) At Chatou 's , they were still men . In the room , they became sleep walkers . I swear . Off came their vests and out came their old dreams , desires . THE FOURTH PATRON I would like MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What ? THE FOURTH PATRON I would like MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Go on , say it ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Stuttering and stammering  --  but he knows what he wants . Fussy as a professional housekeeper . " I want what I want and nothing else will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half so do n't try to sell me a nine . This way , not that way . That way , not this way . " Dot every i and cross every t . I used to wonder why they could n't get what they wanted at home  --  from their wives . Makes you think , huh ? THE FOURTH PATRON No , not like that . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Like this ? THE FOURTH PATRON Yes . Wait a minute . p. 52 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Like kids . I 'm the cowboy , you 're the Indian . THE FOURTH PATRON Call me General . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Yes , General . THE FOURTH PATRON Tell me you 're scared of me . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh ! I 'm scared of you . THE FOURTH PATRON Say you 've just come back from school and got a zero in arithmetic . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Childishly ) I do n't want to go to school any more . The teacher hates me . She gave me a zero in arithmetic . MARIE-PAULE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile as a dream The sleepwalker would wake up if you made one false move  --  or said one wrong word . Now watch . He puts on his vest . THE FOURTH PATRON ( Putting on his vest ) Now I 'll do anything you want . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Anything ? THE FOURTH PATRON Yes . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You swear ? THE FOURTH PATRON I swear . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Then give me another thousand francs . p. 53 THE FOURTH PATRON ( Angrily ) Oh , no . I did n't mean that . ( He starts off . Near the door he stops and turns back ) Not a question of money , you understand  --  but principle ! ( He leaves ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) The ideas they had The tricks made you wonder sometimes what they had hidden inside . Where it came from . Oh , I could go on telling you things until tomorrow . ( The door of the hotel room opens and LECASSE enters . He is a harrassed looking young man of about thirty ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . ( He throws some bills onto the night table and begins to take off his jacket . As he does so , he begins to cry . He collapses into a chair and begins to sob ) Oh , my God ! What have I done ? What have I done ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Astonished ) What 's the matter ? Are you one of those complicated ones ? LECASSE ( Pointing to the money ) I stole it ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh ? LECASSE From my boss . What if he finds out ? No , he 'll have me arrested . p. 54 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Well , why not ? You robbed him . LECASSE Prison . Disgrace . And I 've been honest all my life . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Well , what can I do about it ? LECASSE Give it back to me ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Listen , with your nerve , you could work on skyscrapers . ( LECASSE stops crying . Suddenly , he gets up and moves toward her threateningly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give it back . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Have I earned it or not ? LECASSE You have n't done anything yet . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'm going to . LECASSE You said you liked me . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I always say that . LECASSE Then you do n't like me ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Yes , but not enough to give you back your money . LECASSE ( Furiously ) And my father . Have you thought of my father ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why should I ? p. 55 LECASSE He 's a Colonel . Do you know what 'll happen if I go to prison ? It 'll kill him . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why did n't you think of that before ? LECASSE And if he lives it 'll be worse . How will he live ? Who 'll take care of him ? He has n't got anything but his pension , and you know how much that is . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) But why did you do such a thing ? LECASSE I wanted you . MARIE-PAULE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been better for everybody if you 'd waited till payday . LECASSE I 've been burning up . Ever since I first saw you . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) When was that ? I do n't remember . LECASSE The other night  --  going into Chatou 's . I wanted to follow you  --  but I did n't have any money and I was wearing a horrible necktie . ( In despair again ) Prison . And I 'm only thirty-five years old . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Giving up ) All right , for God 's sake , take it back . LECASSE ( Triumphantly ) Really ? May I ? p. 56 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And thanks for wasting my time . LECASSE ( Leaps toward her and grabs her ) Oh , you 're extraordinary . You . Let me look at you . At your face . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All right . That 's enough . ( LECASSE picks up his money and puts it carefully back into his wallet which he then puts back into his pocket . He approaches her ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LECASSE Now together . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh , no ! LECASSE Was n't it understood ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Was n't what understood ? LECASSE Together , but no money . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Of course not . LECASSE It was understood , I tell you ! ( He grabs her and THEY are about to tumble onto the bed as the wall slides in . The hotel room rolls off and we return to Chatou 's . Things are quiet . There are no patrons . IRMA and MAURICETTE are seated quietly . IRMA is playing solitaire . MAURICETTE is working on her needlepoint . At the bar MONSIEUR ALPHONSE is reading his Paris Turf . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) comes in . THE GIRLS look at her and laugh ) p. 57 IRMA Here she is ! ( IRMA and MAURICETTE laugh hilariously ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What 's got your belly bouncing ? Parsley on my teeth , or what ? MAURICETTE Did he give a good performance today ? Did he play you the one about the boss and the father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Stunned ) What ? IRMA You gave him back his money ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I had to . MAURICETTE And then ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Admitting it ) And then . ( IRMA howls ) IRMA Did you hear that . Alphonse ? The new one got hers today . ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Never mind . The day it happened to me , I even took him out and bought him a big ravioli dinner to cheer him up . Me , and I 've seen everything . MONSIEUR ALPHONSE Oh , yes . To get past Irma , you have to be a smart jockey . MAURICETTE The time he did it to me , he built it up till I cried like a fountain . But I was n't sorry . It was like being in the movies . p. 58 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Are you telling me he did n't really steal any money ? IRMA Wake up ! He 's young Lecasse , of Lecasse furniture . Have n't you ever heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bundle like his . A yacht . Have n't you ever seen his yacht in the magazines ? But he has to do his little act and once in a while get it for nothing . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Angrily ) Well , that was friendly of you to warn me . I 'd 've known how to handle him if you had . IRMA What the hell . He gave it to us , why not to you ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) The dirty pickpocket . Tears the size of my fist . IRMA It 's not that he 's stingy , you understand . Tomorrow , you 'll see . He 'll send you something that costs three times more than he 'd 've given you . But the main thing , he 's had it his way . MAURICETTE They all have to have it their way . I have one , every Thursday . All he wants is for me to talk to him about ski-ing . It drives him wild . MONSIEUR ALPHONSE ( Interested ) No ? MAURICETTE One Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came in the next day I got going about St. Moritz and Mont Blanc and slalom and shussing and jumping . I thought he was going to climb up the wall . p. 59 MONSIEUR ALPHONSE ( Reasonably ) That 's nothing . There are people that like ski-ing . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) Two or three things like that  --  and I got disgusted . I started to look ahead again . IRMA ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) You 're getting jumpy here , are n't you ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You bet . IRMA You 're not made for it . I saw that right away . You 're a girl needs one steady customer . And you could have that with your personality . One man . Or two , three  --  but that 's all . Be in business for yourself . Made-to-order , not ready-to-wear . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) But how do you go about that ? I have several who come back , but not one of them 's offered to set me up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Look , the thing for you to do is pick one out . The right one . And then play the game . Passion . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) How ? IRMA Simple . Wait for the right moment , and then go , " Rha ! Rha "  --  like that  --  in your throat . A sort of gargle . The minute he hears that , he becomes great . To himself , that is . Then you put in a little remark like , " I do n't know what it is , but you drive me crazy . " Understand ? The next day when he comes back  --  " Rha ! Rha ! "  --  and three weeks later you 've got your own furniture . p. 60 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You think so ? IRMA If I did n't have my Rene , I 'd 've done it myself a hundred times . But the important thing is  --  choose the right one . Try for a millionaire . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) But how do you know a millionaire when you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never would 've guessed it . MAURICETTE You ca n't go by Lecasse . He 's a case . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And another one , last week , I thought must be a King Farouk . You know what he turned out to be ? A little paper-scratcher in a bank . IRMA Pay attention . Your trouble is you look at a man 's suit . Means nothing . The average man  --  now , think of it  --  if he has some money what does he do ? Buys himself a beautiful suit . But that 's all . Because when he dresses up , it is n't for himself  --  the way the rich do  --  it 's to impress somebody else . Who sees his underwear or his socks or handkerchief ? And he ca n't stand it  --  to spend money on things nobody 's going to see . Believe me , you can always tell a no-money type by his underwear . Or his socks . MAURICETTE And do n't forget to look at the money he hands you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich ones , they always have better looking money than the others . Newer . p. 61 MONSIEUR ALPHONSE Life 's full of mysteries . Like thunder and lightening and sleeping . IRMA ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) Another thing . Look at their skin . A fine skin  --  well , consider it  --  takes at least ten years of good eating . A good skin is the best reference . MAURICETTE Vitamins another mystery . MONSIEUR ALPHONSE Irma  --  how is it that with all you know  --  you 're still working here ? IRMA Ah ! Because some know and some do . I had a beau once . What ideas he had  --  now he washes windows . And me , I had ideas , too MONSIEUR ALPHONSE Take professors . With all they know  --  diplomas as big as bedsheets  --  I was reading in the paper  --  the 're lucky if they make a living . Even the good ones . MAURICETTE I would n't trust my children to them  --  if I had any . MONSIEUR ALPHONSE No government  --  what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I never threw away one piece of advice I got . I kept my eyes open , my ears too . Then one day , I cast my line THE CROUPIER ( Puzzled ) But you do n't like fishing p. 62 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Watch this fish . ( Over muted dance music  --  a tango  --  JOSEPH enters . He is a short man of fifty . Distinguished , sedate . He looks like a rich uncle . He wears glasses which he takes off from time to time , putting one of the side pieces into his mouth . He steps over to MARIE-PAULE ( II ) after looking the three girls over , and politely invites her to dance . THEY tango . While they are doing so , IRMA gives MARIE-PAULE ( II ) a sign of encouragement . The tango is somewhat complicated by the fact that MARIE-PAULE ( II ) keeps trying to see her partner 's socks from behind . While they dance , Chatou 's disappears behind them and the hotel room takes its place . The music stops ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . When you walked into Chatou 's , I swear , I got a sort of shock . Right here . ( She puts her hand on her breast ) JOSEPH Right there ? Really ? ( He reaches out to verify her report . Marie-Paule ( II ) slaps his hand off , lightly ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Hey ! Do n't handle the fruit ! ( JOSEPH laughs , delightedly and takes off his jacket ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Give it to me , I 'll hang it up . ( SHE takes it back to the coatrack , feeling the lining on the way ) p. 63 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I felt it . A gorgeous lining . ( JOSEPH sits and is about to remove a shoe ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Comes over to him ) I love your socks . ( She feels them ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I thought I was touching my fate . Pure silk . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I have the feeling there 's going to be something special between us . JOSEPH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes some bills from his wallet and puts them on the dressing table . He moves back to MARIE-PAULE ( II ) . She piles her hair up on top of her head and waits . JOSEPH moves to her and kisses her neck ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Immediately ) Rha ! Rha ! ( JOSEPH jumps away , startled . He recovers ) JOSEPH What ? What ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Acting beautifully ) I do n't know what it is . I 'm like some mad thing . JOSEPH ( Touched ) Little lovecat . Sensitive , eh ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Not at all . It 's never happend to me before . What could it be ? p. 64 JOSEPH A little real feeling , perhaps ? ( He embraces her . SHE disengages herself after a moment and shakes her hand ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You must be radio-active or something . JOSEPH ( Flattered ) You think so ? ( THEY change positions . JOSEPH begins to tie his necktie ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) When it was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Taking the bills and holding them out to JOSEPH ) Here , take it . I ca n't have any money between us . JOSEPH ( Astonished ) Take it back ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Shyly ) Please . I 'd rather . JOSEPH ( In spite of himself , he holds out his hand ) I assure you , you 're quite welcome to it . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( In spite of herself , she holds onto the bills ) And you 're quite welcome too . JOSEPH ( Half-joking ) I 'm usually suspicious of something for nothing . p. 65 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) So am I. JOSEPH Well , if you insist . ( He takes the bills , stands for a moment , and then , in a new voice , continues ) But then what there is between us it 's you think it 's love ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) It must be ! ( She betrays her anxiety ) You 'll be back ? JOSEPH How can you ask ? Of course . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regains control ) Ah , no ! Tomorrow , no . Tomorrow I have a dinner . The day after , shall we say ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'll dream of it . JOSEPH ( Putting on his coat , in a daze ) I certainly did n't expect anything like this . I just happened to be passing Chatou 's thinking of nothing . Not even of  --  ( He shakes himself ) Funny . I feel younger . No . Young . ( He goes out , walking on air . He closes the door behind him . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) shrugs her shoulders , and sits down on the bed ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) But I felt miserable . A man who gets away without giving me something , upsets me . Do n't you feel that way ? ( THE CROUPIER reacts fully to this , and when he recovers , speaks ) p. 66 THE CROUPIER I have never been a woman , Ma'am Marie-Paule . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) For weeks , nothing happened . Nothing at all . Joseph kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting organized  --  no ! I dropped hints . But with men I find hinting does n't worl I tried making him jealous . ( JOSEPH has come in during this speech . He stands at the mirror , tying his tie ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) When I think that tomorrow  --  tomorrow night  --  I 'll be right here again but with another man . And the same thing . JOSEPH ( Calmly ) Well , now . I would n't call it the same thing . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Why not ? JOSEPH Because between us there 's love . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Then you do n't mind ? JOSEPH I do n't like to think about it , but after all  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And you expect me to believe you love me ? JOSEPH I do . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) But you 're not jealous . JOSEPH I would be if you loved someone else . But how can I be jealous of one of your clients ? That 's nothing . p. 67 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel about that ? JOSEPH ( Annoyed ) That 's different entirely ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Passionately ) Always the same refrain . I 've heard that one often enough . With their wives it was always different . But how different ? Was it sawing wood ? Was it needlepoint ? Was it mah-jong ? Well , never mind . To make it short , three months and a few dozen " rha rhas " later , I was lying around on my own furniture , Rue D'Artois ! ( Behind JOSEPH and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) , the scene changes to the new apartment . A beautifully furnished nest , full of soft furniture with cushions , a satin doll and Odilon 's canary in its cage . A MAID is straightening up the room as MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and JOSEPH come in . She gets rid of the maid , roughly ) JOSEPH ( To the canary ) Tchip tchip tchip ! ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Affectionate , is n't he ? He knows me . Look how he cocks his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent . ( He sits in a large armchair and wags a playful finger at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) Well , you little coquette . You got your way , did n't you ? But , you were right . Our own place . And that maid you hired , are you happy with her ? p. 68 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'm training her . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) And then what do you suppose happened ? THE CROUPIER What ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) The summer arrived , M'sieur Oscar . The holidays . THE CROUPIER But that was n't unexpected , surely . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I did n't say it was unexpected . I said it arrived . JOSEPH And there 's nothing I can do ! The month of August , I have to spend in the country . With my wife . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) A month goes fast . JOSEPH ( Sadly ) But thirty days without my lovecat . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Thirty-one . JOSEPH Thirty-one . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) But could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JOSEPH Angele wants me to rest . A complete rest . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Irritated ) You seem to be on pretty intimate terms with your wife . JOSEPH Why not ? p. 69 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Do you still sleep with her ? JOSEPH ( Embarrassed ) Now and then . Yes , of course . We 're married , after all . ( He puts his attention back onto the canary ) I ca n't explain it , but this little fellow has simply wormed his way into my heart . It 's the same with children . Have you ever noticed that with children  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Nonchalantly ) What if you tell your wife that this year you have to bring along a secretary . JOSEPH Why ? Do you know how to type ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Certainly . Want to see me ? ( Using his face as a keyboard , she types a few lines ) JOSEPH ( Happily ) Lovecat . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) What I was saying was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris . Vacation time  --  with all those deserted husbands on the loose  --  it 's a festival ! The look they have  --  happy , contented , almost handsome . Wives  --  what they can do to destroy men . It 's mad ! JOSEPH ( Rationally ) You 're right , by God ! A man ca n't take a holiday like that for a month , eg ? I have to keep in touch , dictate my mail and But you will be careful , wo n't you ? You 'll watch your language . p. 70 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I know how to behave . JOSEPH Yes , but sometimes a word slips out . Angele is so conventional . For instance  --  the subject of men with othe men  --  she simply does n't believe it . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I wish I did n't . It 's so discouraging . JOSEPH You 'll be careful ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'll tell her nothing unless she asks me . JOSEPH ( Anxiously ) And then ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOSEPH ( Relieved ) Hah . ( Behind them the scene has become the terrace of a large old house on the banks of the Loire . There is a table with a parasol and a large reclining chair . ANGELE is seated , wearing a sun hat , and reading . She is a woman of about fifty . Obviously goodness itself . She laughs easily . She is giddy and naive . Beside her sits her brother RAYMOND , also about the same age . He sits at the table studying a game of checkers . There are glasses about and bottles . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and JOSEPH walk into the scene and take their places . She stretches out on the reclining chair . HE takes up the game of checkers with Raymond ) p. 71 ANGELE ( Looking up from her book ) Now where do you think they think up such horrors ? Marie-Paule , dear , have you read this book ? ( She holds it aloft ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No , Madame . ANGELE About a young man who falls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I find that rather special as a subject . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) So do I. ANGELE It 's  --  ( Discovering America ) It 's morbid , that 's what it is . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) There are some awful people in the world . ANGELE But is that a reason to write about them ? I know perfectly well what life is . I 'm quite aware that it has its ugly side . ( With a little laugh ) Oh , that film I saw the other day . Joseph , what as the name of that film ? JOSEPH ( Looking up ) What film , my treasure ? ANGELE The film I 'm talking about . JOSEPH But I do n't know what film you 're talking about . ANGELE But I told you all about it . Of course , you never listen to a thing I say . ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh , men , men . All my friends are talking about it , this film . I want to warn you about it . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firmly ) No , no , for a young girl , certainly not . With a married woman it 's different . It hardly matters what we see or what we hear . ( With another little laugh ) And , after all , I am a volunteer nurse . p. 72 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) A family album . There I was , right in the middle of a family album ! Because of her , I swear it , nothing but her , Angele . When I think of it , it 's just not believable . One single person  --  One single one that decides everything , that knows what they want ! The others ? They all fall into line . They do n't even dare budge . Around that woman , people became  --  I do n't know what , like photographs ! From right to left : the fine husband , the nice big brother , the fine wife , the fine secretary . Modest . Devoted . Each one in his place . Even the sky . Never was seen such a sky ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , what a lovely change from that frightful Paris . Where exactly do you live , Marie-Paule ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Rue d'Artois , Madame . ANGELE ( Surprised ) Rue d'Artois ? Is n't that rather expensive ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) It 's just a tiny room . I share it with another girl . ANGELE Oh . ( Solicitously ) And the air . Do you find it healthy there in the Rue d'Artois ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( looking toward ANGELE ) In the clouds ! She was floating on a pink cloud ! You understand , I had nothing against her ; I was having a good time . And how they ate ! All morning they talked about lunch . It made me feel greasy What upset me was that pink cloud of hers . She 'd been on it from birth  --  Just like that , Free . No charge . Had n't cost her a wrinkle ! p. 73 ANGELE Raymond RAYMOND Yes , Angele . ANGELE ( Dreamily ) Do you remember those perfect holidays we used to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork  --  ( ANGELE nods )  --  the pike in black butter , and Elise , our old cook . ( ANGELE can taste it ) ANGELE ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) And the adorable rambler roses all over the terrace . RAYMOND ( Moving a checker ) There , old Joseph ! What do you say to that ? JOSEPH ( Delighted to lose ) I say that you have me . Back to the wall . ( He gets up eagerly , and moves toward MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) Come along , Marie-Paule . Time for business . The mail is waiting for us , and getting impatient . ANGELE ( Outraged ) You 're not going to make her work in this weather ? It 's a crime . JOSEPH ( Nervously ) But yesterday , on account of your picnic , we were n't able to do anything ! And the day before that you interrupted me right in the middle . Ruined the whole afternoon ! p. 74 ANGELE But my President Wilson roses had blossomed . I had to show them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , I have certain  --  responsibilities . ANGELE Oh , pooh . Your little scribbles can wait . ( Playfully ) Do n't listen to him , Marie-Paule , if you do he 'll keep you at it all day . ( To JOSEPH ) Or at least , work out here . JOSEPH No , no ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) In that case , I 'll go for a swim . ( Shepicks up a bathing cap which is lying on a chair and begins to unbutton her dress . She leaves ) ANGELE ( Looking after her , tenderly ) Dear little thing , I really think she 's enjoying herself . JOSEPH ( Annoyed ) No doubt , no doubt . She 's enjoying herself a little too much . I did n't bring her down here to swim in the Loire , you know . ANGELE ( Reasonably ) Now , be kind , Joseph . It 's probably the first holiday of her life . When you get back to Paris you can get things organized again . RAYMOND ( Watching MARIE-PAULE ( II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( To JOSEPH ) Do n't you think so ? p. 75 JOSEPH Who ? Oh , Marie-Paule . I do n't know , I never noticed . To me a secretary is just another machine . ANGELE I do n't agree . I think it 's important to have a pretty face in the office . Refreshing . ( She picks up her parasol , and moves toward the river . Then she calls out ) Marie-Paule ! Hoo-hoo ! ( The voice of MARIE-PAULE ( II ) is heard from the distance ) MARIE-PAULE 'S VOICE Hoo-hoo ! ANGELE ( Shouting ) Do n't go too far ! JOSEPH ( Shouting , as it happens , right into RAYMOND 'S ear ) Watch the current ! ( RAYMOND jumps away and repairs his ear ) ANGELE ( Softly ) Sometimes when she talks you can tell about her background . Do n't you think so ? That lower middle class accent . ( Suddenly worried ) Is it two hours since she ate , do you think ? JOSEPH ( Looking at his watch ) Nearly three . ANGELE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what her class , Imust say , she 's enchanting . Knows her place and stays in it . ( She shouts off again ) Marie-Paule ! Look out for the canoe ! ( To JOSEPH ) Is n't she going too far ? p. 76 JOSEPH No , no , she 's all right . ANGELE Is she good at her work ? Yes , I 'm sure she must be . And have you noticed her clothes ? I never would have believed it possible to find such pretty things , ready made , in bargain sales . Oh , these wonderful little Parisiennes . On simply nothing , they manage to be elegant . Class and style and chic . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Mocking ) Class and style and chic . ANGELE ( Shouting off ) Hoo-hoo ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Hoo-hoo ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) And swimming around out there in that muddy yellow water , I could see them in the distance , and a wild idea struck me : they could have been mymother and father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would always have been this place , this food , my Uncle Raymond but no Roger , no Odilon  --  and no fear ! and Joseph  --  I 'd have been his daughter , not his mistress . As a father and mother , I could have  --  you know what I mean ?  --  loved them . ANGELE ( Shouting ) Marie-Paule ! Come back , now , that 's enough . ( To RAYMOND ) Get her wrapper for her . Hurry . Oh , dear , we left it in the shade , now it wo n't be warm . ( Preoccupied ) Shall I tell her to wait before she comes out ? ( RAYMOND has picked up the wrapper , BUT JOSEPH takes it from him and gives it to MARIE-PAULE ( II ) who comes running in , wearing a bathing suit . JOSEPH and ANGELE buzz about her , anxiously ) p. 77 ANGELE ( Busily ) Dry yourself . Do n't catch cold . ( She goes to the table and pours a cognac ) Here , take a little cognac , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as a medicine . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And there , on the terrace , the idea stayed with me . They were my parents . Worried , like parents . Breathing hard , like parents . I was amazed , I could n't get over it . ANGELE ( With a little laugh ) But our little Marie-Paule is quite the athlete . ( To JOSEPH ) Give her a good rub , she 's cold . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I even thought I noticed a kind of affection between us . Was that true ? Who knows ? The rich and the poor , when they get together , it 's hard to know what 's passing between them . ( JOSEPH continues to rub MARIE-PAULE ( II ) . His hand hesitates conveniently here and there . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) pushes it away sedately ) ANGELE ( Laughingly ) This is quite different from your rue d'Artois , is n't it , dear ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) There ! Finished ! The spell was broken . All I wanted was to push them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to tell you , M'sieu Oscar  --  summer vacations , if they go on long enough  --  always bring out the worst in me . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) stretches out in the reclining chair and warms herself in the sun ) p. 78 THE CROUPIER Very true , Ma'am Marie-Paule . Idleness is the mother of vice , that 's perfectly well known . A week , say two weeks , all right . But any more of it ? Never wise . Take me . In the summer , when I go away with my brother-in-law , a cream of a man , mind you . What happens ? Ten times out of nine we end up not speaking . RAYMOND ( To ANGELE ) Are n't you cold ? Would you like me to go get you a shawl ? JOSEPH ( To ANGELE ) Or your coat , my treasure ? Some nice hot water for your tea ? Seems to me it 's gone tepid . ANGELE ( Leaning toward MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You see how they spoil me ! ( To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . I 'm going in , I think . ( SHE leaves the terrace , followed by JOSEPH . RAYMOND sits and glances easily at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) . He legs are beautifully exposed and she knows it . She extends them from time to time ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) It was beginning to get on my nerves . Put yourself in my place . Here was this woman with her two men . Every wish gratified  --  provided for , adored . And without ever having to do anything for it But me , I had to look out for myself ! So I did . p. 79 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Looking at RAYMOND and stretching her leg ) Do n't you feel bored here in the country , Monsieur Raymond ? RAYMOND Oh , I 'm used to it . Year after year . I 've become a real country boy . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I would n't have thought so . You 're a different type . RAYMOND I used to be a different type . But now  --  look at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean  --  with a young face , I find it becoming . ( A new voice ) You must have had an interesting life . RAYMOND ( Rising and bringing his chair a little closer to her ) Why , Marie-Paule , you sound as if you know quite a lot about men . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What are you saying , Monsieur Raymond ? ( A pause ) RAYMOND And you ? Are n't you bored here ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No , not really . ( A pause ) Sometimes at night . A little RAYMOND ( At sea ) At night ? p. 80 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Yes . Such silence after the Rue d'Artois . It seems deafening . And then , this big bed I have with all its posts RAYMOND ( Faltering ) It 's a Louis XIII bed . Yes . Actually , its mate is at the famous Chateau de Blois . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Ah , yes . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) That meant everything to me , of course . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louis XIII  --  but oh !  --  to get to sleep . RAYMOND Maybe you ought to take something . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Looking at him ) Maybe . RAYMOND ( Forcing a laugh ) Or I could come in and read to you . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Carefully ) There 's an idea . RAYMOND ( Somewhat exhilarated , and getting to his feet ) Are you serious ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks at him through the top of her eyes . RAYMOND stands up . He is giddy with excitement ) Marie-Paule dear little friend I thought  --  but I did n't dare ( He leans toward her and whispers ) This evening ? ( SHE looks at him , her eyes saying yes . HE is too inexperienced to read the message ) Tonight ? ( SHE continues to try to convey affirmation ) Yes ? ( SHE gives up now , and nods ) You 'll leave your door open ? I 'll have to wait until I 'm sure Angele is asleep , of course ( He comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and look here , in the fall , we 'll get together in Paris , too ! We 'll make a wonderful life . Wait and see . I may even take you to some nightclubs . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) finds it difficult to conceal her feelings about this suggestion ) p. 81 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Nightclubs ! Wonderful ! ( SHE and MARIE-PAULE ( I ) exchange a look ) RAYMOND ( His heart pounding ) No ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No ? RAYMOND Tonight 's too far Come along now . ( He takes charge , and before she knows what is happening , HE has her on her feet , and holding firmly onto her wrist , takes her off so swiftly that she barely has time to pick up her dress ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) My dress ! ( THEY disappear ) THE CROUPIER Now here , if you 'll permit me , Ma'am Marie-Paule , I 'm not sure I follow you . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Wait . ( JOSEPH and ANGELE return . She is wearing a scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentment . They move forward and stand looking straight ahead ) ANGELE ( Finally ) Oh , what a sunset ! JOSEPH Yes . ( He is suddenly aware of the fact that the terrace is deserted . He begins to look around , turning and turning . It does not keep him from providing , however , his customary , echoed reply . It is toneless ) Oh , what a sunset . ( SHE continues to talk , JOSEPH continues to look off in all directions , frowning , and not allowing himself to be suspicious in the slightest way ) p. 82 ANGELE Now , if a painter were to use those colors , people would say it was simply a postcard . And how unfair that would be . But look ! You 're not looking . JOSEPH Of course I am . ( He looks out , troubled now and repeats ) Oh , what a sunset . ANGELE Where 's Raymond ? JOSEPH Yes . ANGELE ( Calling off ) Ray-mond ! ( From offstage RAYMOND 's VOICE calls back ) RAYMOND Cou-cou ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks unsettled . He is followed shortly by MARIE-PAULE ( II ) who drifts in and waits in the background ) ANGELE ( Pointing front ) Look . RAYMOND ( In JOSEPH 'S reading ) Oh , what a sunset . ANGELE Remember the summer house ? ( RAYMOND nods ) And the gardener ? ( RAYMOND nods ) And the time he said the four-letter word to Papa ? RAYMOND Five-letter word . ANGELE Five ? I remember a four . p. 83 RAYMOND No , no . Five . And before it the word old . Old five-letter word . ANGELE ( With a horrified laugh ) You 're right ! And to think that Papa even forgave him . Such a good man , Papa . And the playhouse . Do you remember our playhouse ? RAYMOND ( Rather mechanically ) And the gooseberry tarts . And Old Elise . ANGELE And Poincare , when he came to visit Papa 's factory . RAYMOND And our uncle from Tours . ANGELE And the yellow plums from Nice . JOSEPH ( Stepping between them , irritated ) Can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sigh ) So sweet , those memories . But then , there are bitter ones , too . ( RAYMOND nods sympathetically ) Like that dreadful night in Fontainebleau when I stood there weeping ? ( RAYMOND nods , in remembered pain ) Looking at the empty ribbon dangling from my wrist ? Because I 'd lost my dance card ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( In a fury ) Her dance card ! Silly bitch ! ( She makes a menacing gesture at the group . JOSEPH , ANGELE and RAYMOND leave . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) wanders about the terrace ill at ease and out of sorts during the following ) My nerves were clawing at me . I was suffocating . You 'll say to me what the hell was all that to you ? Well , you tell me ! The injustice of it turned me inside out . Who was looking out for me ? Nobody . I should have looked out for myself ! My interested were clear : Joseph during the week , Raymond on the weekends , I could have doubled my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing to pieces . What came over me ? I do n't know . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) has begun to straighten out the teacups on the table . ANGELE comes in , knitting . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) makes a little noise with the teacups ) p. 84 ANGELE ( A finger to her lips ) Shhh . Quiet . Raymond is taking a nap . I 'm just sitting there beside him and knitting . He 's so exhausted these days . I do n't know what it is . Let 's let him sleep a little . He has insomnia , poor boy . ( She disappears ) THE CROUPIER Have you ever noticed it , Ma'am Marie-Paule , the people who have insomnia at night are usually the ones who sleep all day ? JOSEPH ( Coming in from the opposite side ) Angele not here ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) begins a gesture to silence him , but in the middle of it she changes her mind ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) She 's gone into town with Raymond . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you worrying about ? The old girl 's gone . ( She begins to fondle him ) JOSEPH ( Flattered ) Oh , you greedy little thing . ( THEY begin to exchange caresses . ANGELE appears at the top of the terrace , and , bewildered , takes off her glasses . JOSEPH kisses MARIE-PAULE ( II ) on the neck ) ( Over JOSEPH 'S shoulder , she sees ANGELE who has reached the height of stupefaction . SHE climaxes the moment by planting a solid kiss onto JOSEPH 'S lips ) p. 85 ANGELE ( In a moan ) Joseph ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and JOSEPH spring apart . JOSEPH is horror-stricken ) JOSEPH ( Automatically ) Oh what a sunrise ! ( Now ANGELE finds her voice and uses it ) ANGELE Joseph ! RAYMOND ( As he comes rushing in ) What 's happened ? ANGELE ( On the verge ) Joseph and she  --  that she  --  that  --  . Together ! RAYMOND Together ? ( ANGELE steadies herself against RAYMOND ) JOSEPH Appearances may be against me , but  --  RAYMOND ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What a way to repay us for having you here like  --  yes , like a member of the family . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) AND MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Tough and together ) Member of the family , my ass ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Continuing ) Having me here is right ! Who was that member of the family in my bed last night ? You , maybe ? ( RAYMOND is frozen stiff and JOSEPH even stiffer ) Who was that crawling and sprawling under the canopy of the Louis XIII ? Not Louis XIII , surely ! ( At this point , MARIE-PAULE ( I ) joins her again , in indignation , and THEY both continue to the top of the speech ) p. 86 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) AND MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Together ) No , it was you , you big . bull ! So buckle your mouth ! ( JOSEPH , ANGELE and RAYMOND are wrecked beyond repair . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) look at each other and exchange a joyous burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a snake ) ANGELE Raymond ! JOSEPH ( Going toward RAYMOND ) You ? RAYMOND ( Beside himself ) I 'm a bachelor after all ! ( ANGELE is holding onto her head ) ANGELE Oh , no . ( SHE sinks into an armchair . JOSEPH and RAYMOND rush toward her . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) are still together , arm in arm , enjoying the spectacle enormously ) JOSEPH Angele ! RAYMOND Little sister ( With each supplication they move toward her and with each move toward her they are rebuffed roughly . THEY stand away . ANGELE opens her eyes and looks at JOSEPH ) ANGELE Joseph . ( It is though she were seeing him for the first time ) Oh , ( She turns to RAYMOND and discovers him ) Raymond . ( With horror ) Oh . ( And now she simply sobs ) p. 87 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Simultaneously with the above , in triumph ) Goodbye , everything ! Crash ! Bang ! Goodbye ! The family album was ripped into a thousand pieces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last ! No sense to it , and I knew it . I was losing a fortune and I knew it . But I did n't care . It was worth it , I swear . Just ot be on top for a moment . Just to have thing my way for once - at last ! ( Indeed , what she is saying describes the action before us . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) punctuates the tirade with bursts of victorious laughter ) @x SCENE : The set remains the Casino at Monte Carlo . AT RISE : MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and the CROUPIER are discovered ; he at his table , she at the bar . The inset is now the interior of a bar of the sort which ODILON described earlier . Clearly , the place is unfinished and not yet open but it is going to be one of those luxurious , intimate , small bars . Some of the chairs are on the tables . At one side of the inset a PAINTER up on a ladder is painting the walls . The color is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the back of a chair hangs a fur stole . Joseph is seated . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) is standing nearby . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To the CROUPIER ) So then  --  this 'll surprise you  --  Joseph came back to me . THE CROUPIER ( Surprised ) The same Joseph ? After that awful brouhaha and all those insults ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( With a shrug ) You 're damn right . THE CROUPIER But where was his dignity ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) How would I know ? His dignity was n't what I was looking for . THE CROUPIER That 's no reason . p. 89 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Of course it is . With men , you know what you usually find ? THE CROUPIER No . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) What you 're looking for . Nothing better , nothing worse , and nothing else . You have n't noticed that ? THE CROUPIER Let me think . Now . Suppose Monsieur Gaston comes in . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Good . Now what do you expect from Monsier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll sing you a little song ? No . You expect him to put chips on the numbers . And what does he do ? He puts chips on the numbers . THE CROUPIER Well , of course . This is a casino , after all . But , if you will permit me , Ma'am Marie-Paule , there 's a fault in your reasoning . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Take Angele . In her Joseph , what was she looking for ? A good husband . And she found it . ( She walks across to the table , passing in front of JOSEPH ) He was a very good husband , Joseph  --  of his kind . Affectionate , considerate  --  ( She rubs her thumb against her forefinger )  --  plenty of the good soup . Dignity itself . Angele told me one day  --  they were visiting somewhere , and the hostess made just a slight insinuation . Joseph stood up and said " Come Angele . We must take our leave . " In the manner of Louis XV . That must make you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was looking for it . Me , I was looking for the wolf in him . I found the wolf . In the same Joseph . p. 90 THE CROUPIER But the real one was the wolf . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Who knows ? My idea is there were two Josephs  --  one as real as the other , each one giving what was asked of him . What Angele asked , what I asked . The good husband , the wolf . Dignity , no dignity . ( She continues in the tone of a clerk ) What can I do for you , sir ? A casserole ? Here you are , sir , a casserole . ( She turns to the other side ) And you , sir ? A potato masher ? Here we are , a potato masher . ( To the CROUPIER ) The casserole is just as real as the potato masher . You 'll find what you 're looking for . That explains everything . That explains why in life we each find the same things over and over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lover , a lover turns up , not the pastor of the parish , eh ? What do you say to that ? With Joseph , it was the same . What did he ask of me ? What I could give him . If he 'd met a nun do you think he would have asked the same thing of her ? ( THE CROUPIER is shocked ) That proves it . THE CROUPIER ( Shaking his finer at her ) It 's a specious argument , Ma'am Marie-Paule . What we call in logic , specious . ( In the inset MARIE-PAULE ( II ) has wandered down to the bar and sits upon a stool . JOSEPH floats down to join her ) p. 91 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( To JOSPEH ) Have something ? JOSEPH A little  --  ( He considers ) A little porto . But just a finger . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) A finger which way ? Lying down or standing up ? JOSEPH ( Smiling a little ) Somewhere between , little monkey . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) pours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( II ) And how 's our dear Angele these days ? JOSEPH She  --  you know how it is  --  she had quite a shock , walking in that way , finding us that way . ( He takes a sip of his port ) Such an innocent . She broke out in a rash , you know , Purple . Did I mention that ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No . JOSEPH Yes , with pink spots . As I often say , health is  --  more than anything  --  health is a question of morale . Say in my case . When business is good , I have no rheumatism . Same with everyone . ( He takes another sip ) And I helped her morale along  --  Angele 's  --  by giving her an ermine jacket . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) An ermine jacket ? p. 92 JOSEPH ( Having gone too far ) Just a short one ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Hah ! What 's she ever done to deserve that ? JOSEPH I had to do it , that 's all ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Sulking ) Please do . JOSEPH It 's about Raymond . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What about him ? JOSEPH She could n't forgive him . No , she could forgive me , but not him . And wo n't see him any more . Very original  --  do n't you think ?  --  her feelings . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Has he tried giving her an ermine jacket , too ? JOSEPH ( To the canary ) Tchip , tchip , tchip ! ( Absently to MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Yes , and next month , I 'm sending her to the Riviera . To recover completely . To Antibes . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Annoyed ) The Riviera , is that all ? Why do n't you tell her to get off her fat seat and do something ? ( But JOSEPH has not heard this . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) moves toward him ) Joseph , now that we 're pasted together again . p. 93 JOSEPH ( He declaims ) Yes , now that our love has survived its first storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to get organized . JOSEPH ( To the canary ) Tchip , tchip , tchip ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Are you listening to me or not ? JOSEPH Listening , my dove . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Up to now , you 've given me about a hundred and fifty thousand francs a month . JOSEPH ( Surprised ) As much as that ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( With a look toward MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Well , with the price of onions these days . And self respect comes pretty high too . JOSEPH I was n't complaining , was I ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) A hundred and fifty multiplied by twelve  --  that comes to about two million a year . JOSEPH ( With a start ) Good God , that is too much ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Joseph , I 've been thinking . Last night , in fact , I could n't sleep on account of thinking . I do n't want to bankrupt you . What good would that do me ? And I do n't like to have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound of disgust ) Blah ! p. 94 JOSEPH I beg your pardon ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I said , Blah ! So my idea is to earn somethings for myself . JOSEPH ( With a faint ray of hope ) Back to Chatou 's ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And taking on clients ? No , that would hurt you too much , I know it , jealous as you are . ( JOSPEH says nothing . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) gets up and crosses over to him . HE now stands between both of the MARIE-PAULES ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) That would hurt you too much , would n't it ? JOSEPH ( To the canary ) Tchip , tchip , tchip . ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) makes a menacing gesture with the back of her arm . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) makes the same gesture . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) returns to the table ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Bitter , but in control ) So I want you to buy me a bar . JOSEPH ( Absently ) A bar ? MARIE-PAULE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . I 'm not asking for Fouquet 's . Just something to make a living . JOSEPH A bar ? A whole bar ? p. 95 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) A whole bar , yes . What would I do with half a bar ? Instead of all your money going who knows where  --  we 'd have something solid . Property . That we could see if we had to . Capital . I understand about such things . Capital . ( JOSEPH hesitates , SHE presses ) You give your wife ermine , do n't you ? JOSEPH ( Confused , shaking his head ) A bar . ( He moves into the inset and looks about . SHE moves to the bar . The matter seems to be settled ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) There 's a business man for you . Rather than spend two million a year , and for how long ?  --  after all , we were n't stuck together for life  --  He was glad to spend fourteen million at one swoop . THE CROUPIER What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOSEPH goes toward the door ) JOSEPH Well , later , then . I 'll be back at about eight . All right ? Where would you like to have dinner ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) We 'll see . JOSEPH ( To the canary ) Tchip , tchip , tchip . ( He goes out ) ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks at the PAINTER up on the ladder ) p. 96 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) How 's the art work going ? You 're not exactly wearing yourself out , are you ? And what about that corner ? Supposed to do itself ? THE HOUSE PAINTER It 's still wet , the first coat . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And while it dries , you wait and while you wait , I pay . I wish I had your job . ( She returns to the bar and begins to look over her stock ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And now  --  what do you think ?  --  Odilon returns ! You remember Odilon ? THE CROUPIER The barman ? The one who went to Egypt ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student of physiognomy . Human physiognomy . My profession demands it . One day , for instance , a man came here to my table . I looked at him . He looked at me . And I said  --  . Well , you 'll never believe this , but it turned out he was  --  Fernandez . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) All at once with this bar on my hands  --  the installation , the licenses , the decorators  --  I was feeling a little lost . The lemonade business is n't so simple . You have to know how . And that Odilon  --  he knew . It was his idea , you remember , to open a bar . I wrote him . A week later  --  he landed . THE CROUPIER You wrote him ? After what he did to you ? Permit me to say it , Ma'am Marie-Paule , but you surprise me. p. 97 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) One minute . I do n't forgive even the ones who 've done nothing to me . And Odilon  --  he 'd done plenty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Odilon comes sailing in in fine fettle ) ODILON Here we are ! Lucky for us I have this pal over at Dubonnet 's . You should 've seen the feast I stuffed down him . ( He puts his hand on his ribs ) My liver 's in tears . ( He takes a bottle from his pocket and shakes out a pill ) Glass of water . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) goes to the bar and gets him some water ) But , never mind , by the time we reached the cheese , it was set . He 's going to give us everything we need with six months credit . Not bad , eh ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Handing him the glass ) Good for you . ODILON You realize that without me , you 'd be as helpless as a mummy , old girl . ( To the canary ) What do you say to that , Cat ? Tchip , tchip , tchip ! ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You 'll never know how it hurt me to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I could count on you . ( He moves to her , laughing ) Do you know this one ? The woman a fellow could count on ? ( He executes a physical trick with her which has to do with counting her attractions . He swings her about as he sings out ) One ! Two ! Three ! Four ! p. 98 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( A bit subdued ) That 's good , very good . What about the whiskey ? ODILON ( Taking a paper from his pocket proudly ) Another pal . Look at this . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Reading it admiringly ) Well done , young man ! ODILON ( Dripping , self-satisfaction ) Once I get started there 's no stopping me . ( He wags his finger beneath his nose ) Pstcha ! If it had n't been for my liver , what a career I could 've had ( he looks at the walls ) Not bad . This place is beginning to look not too bad . And that green . Nile green , they call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . ODILON Oh , sure . ( He sits ) Egypt ! That 's no place at all . Not for people like us . You and me  --  people with a certain amount of culture . And death for the liver . It 's hot , you have to drink . You may say , try mineral water  --  but thanks very much . And then the English , you know me . Every time I saw an Englishman I thought of Marshal Ney . Life 's tough down there . You want to do a little bed work ? The mosquitoes stop you . And as for relaxation , forget it . Once I went over to see the  --  the  --  ( He remembers the word )  --  the pyramids ! ( He announces his decision ) All right . I 'll admit they 're something , a curiosity . But once you 've seen them  --  ( He shrugs )  --  you 've seen them . Just a lot of stone , after all . A pile of rocks . There 's only one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of the pyramids ? p. 99 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) The green . ODILON Green ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Nile green . ODILON Ah , yes , Nile green . No better color for a bar . Know why ? Because green makes people thirsty . They 've taken statistics . Consider the birds . Always in the greenery . What happens ? They drink three times their weight . Now , consider that on a human scale . You see ? I think of everything . ( He stands up ) Did Cat get his water ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) That was Odilon for you . Full of ideas . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) So ? What do you think of this place ? Honestly . ODILON ( Holding out a stiff thumb ) Perfect . Situation beautiful , not another bar for two hundred meters and wait till you see the clientele I attract . We 're going to pile it up here . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I hope so . ( ODILON looks about the bar with a satisfied air , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been watching him , exchanges a look with MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and moves about to the other side of him ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( continuing ) There 's something I want to ask of you . p. 100 ODILON Sure . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) How would you like to come and work for me as my barman ? ( ODILON looks at her blankly . He blinks . Is she joking ? Did he hear right ? Finally , he echoes tonelessly ) ODILON Your barman ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All you 've been doing for me , for the bar  --  of course , it may be friendship  --  but then I think , maybe you 're trying to worm your way in as my barman  --  because you 're too bashful to bring it up . But I 'm not . ODILON ( Stiff with stupefaction ) Your barman ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 've worked out a budget . I can offer you eighty thousand a month . ( ODILON comes out of his stupor . He stands up and walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what you just did ? Stripped me naked and shoved me into a matchbox . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What ? ODILON You must be out of your head . Your barman ? Me ? With my ability ? You ought to be glad I 'm willing to take you on as a partner ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You take me ? That 's good . I bring the establishment , I bring the capital . And what do you bring ? p. 101 ODILON Not much . Just my connections , my work , my experience . ( He shouts ) My self ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Your experience , I appreciate . That 's why I 'm offering you eighty thousand francs a month for it . And you can keep half your tips . That 's not bad . ODILON In Cairo I earned four times that ! MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Maybe you should have stayed there . ODILON ( Floundering ) And what about your letter ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And what about my letter ? ODILON ( He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter like this is a contract . Yes , in any court ! ( He begins to read ) Dear , crazy grizzly bear , I  --  All right , I 'll skip the apperitif . ( He resumes reading ) ' I have a bar at last . And old gentleman gave it to me . We could be happy , you and I. Instead of growing moldy down there with your Arabs  --  come back quick . ( He stops , furious ) In the first place , in Egypt , they 're not Arabs  --  ( He resumes reading ) Come back quick . You and I will cut ourselves a nice slice. So ? p. 102 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) So . Anything about partnership in that ? ODILON No , it 's all about a nice game of Lotto . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You better buy yourself some glasses . ( She takes the letter and reads it herself ) I have a bar at last. ( She looks up ) Mention you so far ? ( Back to the letter ) We could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , we 're happy , are n't we ? ODILON And what about the come back quick ? You wrote come back quick. MARIE-PAULE ( II ) That 's a cry of love , not a contract . ODILON ( Growing more angry ) A cry of love , eh ? And what about the slice ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What slice ? ODILON ( Desperately ) We 'll cut ourselves a nice slice. ! You wrote that in black and white . That means we 're partners  --  in any court . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Confidently ) No , no , no . That 's not what I meant at all . There are slices and slices . There 's a slice of a lottery , a slice of cake , a slice of sausage . p. 103 ODILON ( Furious ) I 'll show you sausage ! ( He slaps her . Then , frightened by what he has done , he backs away , while the PAINTER leans over his ladder to watch the excitement ) And you 're lucky I stopped there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you threw me overboard and left me to drown ! ODILON ( Sulking ) It 's not fair . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Losing herself ) What about the ermine for her , that idiot  --  is that fair ? ODILON What ermine ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) And the minced pork and the black butter and the dance card and Chatou 's . And Marshal Ney , was that fair ? ODILON Just leave Marshal Ney out of this . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You better learn a little about how the world turns , my boy . Maybe being behind the counter a while 'll help you . Tomorrow at three o'clock you start . Settled ? ODILON I thought we were going to have dinner tonight . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I 'm having dinner with Joseph . The Tour d'Argent . ( She takes her fur stole and hands it to ODILON so that he can hold it for her ) Where 're your manners ? ( He throws the stole onto her contemptuously . SHE caresses it ) Have you seen this , what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bar . What 're you going to give me ? They 're nice , these animals . So soft . ( She opens her compact and begins to repair her makeup ) p. 104 ODILON ( Timidly ) Well , tomorrow , eh ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Tomorrow . ODILON But listen  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Cool ) What ? ODILON Us two . You and me ? it 's not over ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) We 'll see . Once in a while maybe . A little siesta . ( She shrugs ) ( ODILON leaves , defeated . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks up and sees the PAINTER leaning over the ladder ) You still there ? THE HOUSE PAINTER Well , I finished a while ago but I stayed for the excitement . I must say , you certainly are a somebody . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Thank you . THE HOUSE PAINTER A woman like you , well , I did n't know there were any left . My wife  --  I do n't know how to tell you  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants  --  ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) has been studying him ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) What time is it ? THE HOUSE PAINTER ( Looking at his watch ) Twenty to eight . I 'd even say , twenty-two to eight . p. 105 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) That gives us a little while . ( She starts off and turns back ) Coming ? That Judo business boiled me up . THE HOUSE PAINTER ( Beside himself ) Of course , of course . Very nice of you . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Coming back ) But let 's understand one things . This is on your time , not mine , understood ? THE HOUSE PAINTER Absolutely . ( He is off the ladder now ) I do n't like to leave everything in such a mess . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) You 'll straighten up later . ( She goes through one of the doors upstage . He follows ) THE CROUPIER ( Catching the tone of the painter 's enthusiasm ) Oh , my God , to be in the right place at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been in his shoes . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Why , M'sieu Oscar , what are you saying ? THE CROUPIER I do n't deny it , Ma'am Marie-Paule . Let it come out . Ever since I 've known you I 've often said to myself , you fool , you were born twenty years too late . Actually , it could have happened . My mother had me when she was thirty . If she 'd done it when she was nineteen , I would have been your man . I do n't mean to offend you . p. 106 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Not at all . Age is age . Time is time  --  I often think of the men I might 've had if they had n't been too soon or too late . For all we know , in the time of Louis XIV there may have been a perfect man who sat there all his life waiting for me . THE CROUPIER ( Carried away ) Who knows , it might have been Louis XIV himself ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Odilon talked about Marshal Ney , I felt a little something here ? ( She puts her hand on her heart ) I used to say to myself , this Ney , he and I might have got together . Why not ? THE CROUPIER Why not ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) He was a redhead , it seems . And I 've never had a redhead . It 's almost as if I were saving myself for him . ( During the above  --  JACQUOT , a tall , dark , sad looking barboy has entered , removed the ladder , put the chairs down on the floor and generally straightened up the bar . A professional named MINOUCHE comes in and sits at a table , alone . TWO CUSTOMERS come in . ODILON takes his place at the bar and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) goes to the two customers . JACQUOT goes to the bar . ODILON mixes drinks ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Shouting across the bar ) And what about those two vermouth cassis ? Still milking them ? p. 107 ODILON ( Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinks into glasses from a shaker ) Two vermouth cassis ( JACQUOT puts the glasses on a tray and picks them up ) JACQUOT Two vermouth cassis . ( He starts across the bar to serve them , and on the way , sings a snatch of an operatic air , gaily ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) I 'd found a waiter who also did numbers . That 's an advantage in a bar . His name is  --  His name was  --  Jacquot . ( In the bar , JACQUOT goes into his act ) JACQUOT ( Bowing to Marie-Paule ( II ) Madame ! ( He bows to Minouche ) Mademoiselle ! ( He bows to the rest ) Messieurs ! ( He continues ) Good evening . Gut abend . Bon soir . Das vidanya . Hoalskaloy . Vend veed . Skawee yewka . I thank you . This ends our visit to the League of Nations . ( He bows to Minouche ) Madame la Duchesse . ( He makes the noise of a drum roll and ends it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulls an enormous handkerchief , colored , out of his pocket ) Watch carefully . ( He opens the handkerchief and displays it ) Does anyone know what this is ? ( Silence ) No ? No one ? I see I 'll have to tell you . It 's something called  --  a handkerchief !  --  about which our greatest lyric poet , Racine , has so beautifully written : ( He recites throbbingly ) ' Do n't use your sleeve and spoil your clothes Use one of these to wipe your nose ! ' ( Mild response ) And so , a handkerchief . A simple handkerchief , ladies and gentlemen , Madames and Messieurs , Signors and Signorettes . With no strings , no holes , no secrets . If this handkerchief could talk it would say nothing . And now here is a thumb . ( He holds his thumb out before him standing straight up ) Not one of the best , but the best I could get for this evening . A real thumb . ( He holds it out toward Minouche ) Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thank you , Madame la Duchesse . Honored by your confidence . And now I ask you to believe no more than you can see with your own eyes . The thumb , the handkerchief . ( He is about to put the handkerchief over his thumb , when he stops momentarily and speaks to the thumb ) Goodbye , old friend , it was nice knowing you . ( He throws the handkerchief over his thumb , makes a few passes , brings his fist down onto the hidden thumb , and pulls the handkerchief away revealing his thumbless fist ) There you are . Incredible , no ? The thumb has disappeared . A miracle of science ? Not at all . A triumph of technology ? No . Black magic ? Guess again , ladies and gentlemen , what you have seen is simply a trick . A simple little trick which I learned during my last visit to the Yutt tribe . The chief taught it to me personally . His name was Id . Known as Id-Yutt . ( No laugh . JACQUOT looks across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . ( He looks at MINOUCHE ) Ah , my dear Madame . You may not like this part of my act but would it surprise you to know that I am a mind-reader as well ? Yes , I can read your mind right now . I am reading it . You are thinking : this act is rotten ! Correct ? I can only assure you that you are wrong , because , believe it or not , I actually did remove my thumb and here , Madame la Duchesse  --  here it is ! ( The handkerchief falls open in his thumbless hand and with his right hand he picks up a disembodied thumb and hands it to her . MINOUCHE , startled , holds on to the thumb for a moment , looks at it , galvanized in horror , screams , jumps up and drops it . JACQUOT is on the floor at once scrambling around for it ) Please , Madame , careful ! That 's my property you 're handling ! ( He takes the thumb from the floor and pretends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people in the bar are laughing  --  not so much at JACQUOT but at the reaction which he has elicited from the simple MINOUCHE . Finally , she joins in the joke ) ( JACQUOT busies himself at the tables . ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS pays him , tips him and leaves , with his friend . MINOUCHE sits down again ) p. 108 ODILON ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Not bad , this boy . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) does not answer and in a moment ODILON sees the reason . SHE is staring fixedly at JACQUOT as he works . ODILON takes his attention from MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and puts it onto MINOUCHE ) ODILON ( Continuing ) How 's business , Minouche ? MINOUCHE ( A shrug ) I 'm meeting this turkey I found the other night . With a Cadillac . He 's late . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) A Cadillac 's not so easy to park . Give him a minute to  --  ( She studies MARIE-PAULE ( II ) who is still standing quietly beside the counter still looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  my youth . THE CROUPIER She looks to me as if she 's nailed to the floor . I recognize that moment . There are moments like that in life when time seems to stand still . ( He throws the ball onto the wheel aimlessly ) ODILON ( Leans over the counter to MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Are you giving it to me in the liver ? Tell me . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Startled out of her reverie ) What ? p. 109 ODILON ( Mocking her ) What ? ( He continues harshly ) With this Jacquot bastard . You do n't think I 'm blind , do you ? Right under my nose . Madame batting her eyelashes like a native dancer from Indo-China . It 's not becoming to you , believe me . I put up with your Monsieur Jospeh , but there are reasons . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) makes a sound of disgusted anger and with a gesture of her arm silences ODILON who steps away . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Buckle your mouth ! ( ODILON leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar at each other , in love . MINOUCHE sits quietly , staring ahead . It is almost as though she were aware of the beauty in the air ) THE CROUPIER ( Fascinated ) Jacquot , Ma'am Marie-Paule ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( With a shrug of remembered disbelief ) He was the only man I ever loved . Of all of them  --  the too many  --  the one . Jacquot . Why ? ( She shrugs ) He made me laugh  --  and laugh . You think that 's a little thing ? It 's not . No matter how lost you are  --  if you can laugh you find your soul  --  at least for a minute . You understand ? Animals , for instance  --  animals never laugh . p. 110 THE CROUPIER ( Struck ) How true ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Cats , dogs  --  THE CROUPIER Fish . ( He changes his mind ) I 'm not so sure about fish . You know sometimes , when they get away , they actually seem to look back and  --  ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) MINOUCHE That 's all ! I 'm through with this waiting . It 's a bore and I 'm getting older . ( MINOUCHE leaves . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and JACQUOT continue to stare at each other across the bar . JACQUOT moves toward MARIE-PAULE ( II ) . He is on his way to the bar . As he nears her , SHE takes a step downstage , intercepting him . HE stops . THEY stand for a moment facing each other . They exchange a smile . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks down at JACQUOT 'S rist and speaks softly ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Who gave you those ? They 're not like you at all . ( She holds out a little box ) Here . JACQUOT ( Troubled ) You should n't have done that , Madame Marie-Paule . ( But he takes the box and opens it ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I want to put them on for you . ( She removes one of the cufflinks which he is wearing and throws it to the floor . JACQUOT kneels to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot on it . HE is kneeling close to her , his head almost touching her . He rises slowly and smiles as SHE puts on one of the cufflinks . From off , soft music fades in . " Nuits de Chine . " She puts on the second cufflink . THE CROUPIER and MARIE-PAULE ( I ) are watching quietly ) ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ) , softly ) What is this ? What 's happening to us ? p. 111 JACQUOT Marie-Paule MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Slowly and breathlessly ) I did n't know . I did n't think it would be so strong . JACQUOT Marie-Paule . Your voice it 's you sound like someone else . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Sunday . All right ? ( JACQUOT nods . SHE smiles , gently ) We ' ' go to Nogent ! ( The volume of the music increases . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) dances away from JACQUOT , gracefully . She dances over toward MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and THE CROUPIER , who watch her with interest . SHE dances back toward JACQUOT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . It is as though MARIE-PAULE ( II ) is teaching him . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) is singing to the music and THE CROUPIER is beating out the rhythms on the table . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and JACQUOT laugh as JACQUOT makes a misstep , but THEY find their way back to the rhythm and continue to dance . Finally , they stop , out of breath but laughing together ) JACQUOT Here . Give me your ear . I want to put something into it . Something delicious . ( THEY embrace . HE is whispering something to her , something personal and private which is reflected on her face . The music continues ) p. 112 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) That song ( She murmurs a part of the lyric ) But you You are my starMy guiding star.My love ! ( She is weeping . THE CROUPIER attempts to comfort her ) THE CROUPIER Do n't cry , Ma'am Marie-Paule . It 's love . ( After a moment he continues timidly ) If love is n't gay , what good is it ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and JACQUOT , who , hand in hand , move to another spot and fall into another embrace ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) We went to Nogent . We took a lovely little room . We leaned out the window  --  listened to people drifting by in the rowboats  --  having a good time . Then , the next day ( The music stops abruptly . JACQUOT and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) change positions ) JACQUOT ( Play-acting gaily ) And I do n't want to go , but duty calls . I have to go and get the whiskey . Odilon 's orders . We 're running short . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All right , if you have to . But go quickly and come back quickly . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( With a cry ) No ! Not yet , not so fast . p. 113 THE CROUPIER ( Astonished ) But , Ma'am Marie-Paule  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Gently ) Should n't you take your raincoat ? It may rain . Take my umbrella . JACQUOT I 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodramatically continues ) Be brave , Princess , I go , but I shall return . ( He salutes and clicks his heels . SHE laughs ) ( THEY embrace ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Whispering ) Please hurry back Please ! ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) has risen . Her hand is on her mouth as she watches the scene . JACQUOT starts out ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Not yet ! One minute more . THE CROUPIER But he ca n't hear you . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Begging ) Only one minute is that too much to ask ? Jacques , my Jacques . ( Almost as though he hears her , JACQUOT stops in the doorway , and turns back for a moment ) Come back . ( JACQUOT looks toward MARIE-PAULE ( II ) considering it , but at this moment she bends down under the bar . HE goes ) Jacques !

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast approaching car is heard outside the bar , the brakes are applied suddenly and the car screams to a stop . There is the sound of a shot . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) jumps up and runs to the door . THE CROUPIER looks toward the door . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) runs out . The scene blacks out and in the blackness two more shots are heard , followed by the sound of a car picking up speed and roaring off . The lights come on . The door to the bar has been reversed . The body of JACQUOT lies on the pavement in front of it . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) screams . She goes to JACQUOT and kneels beside him ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) They 've killed him . ( She embraces his body ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( In a lament ) They killed him for me . They killed him . ( She makes a gesture of futility ) If it had even been for something he had done . But no , it was a mistake  --  some hoodlums that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calmly going along  --  and they killed him for me . Like that . Like kids when they destroy something and do n't know what they 're doing and do n't care . Pom-pom-pom ! And they took his life . And also they took mine  --  Oh what the hell  --  we 'd hardly begun  --  one time , one single time when we went that Sunday to Nogent in that little room we could hear the people . We watched them having a good time  --  laughing , eating , treating themselves to a good bottle of wine . And we saw a pick-up  --  it made us fall around laughing . Laughing . It seemed so right for others to be together and to be happy because we were . I 'd never felt so part of things before  --  or since . ( She sobs ) I think , no  --  I know  --  that was the only day of my life I was really alive . ( The focus returns to the interior of the bar . ODILON is behind the counter . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 115 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Shivering ) I 'm afraid . ( JOSEPH goes to her and takes her by the shoulders ) JOSEPH Do n't be . I 'm here . ( He smiles ) Remember me ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Too well . So get your carcass out of here and leave me alone ! JOSEPH Me ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) No , the Pope . JOSEPH I know you 're upset . But it 'll pass . I understand . This poor boy , such a fine boy . One minute here and the next  --  ( He shrugs ) But you 're too sensitive . People should n't be so  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Out ! Can you hear me ? Disappear ! I never want to see you again ! JOSEPH ( Continuing ) You 're excited but you must n't take things like this to heart . He was a good boy , no question , but he can be replaced . Well , maybe not exactly . His little numbers , that may be harder . ( Generously ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the papers . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) looks at him . She is not without compassion for his density ) p. 116 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( With great feeling ) I loved him JOSEPH Of course you did . We all loved him . He was a good boy . And to think that only last Saturday he  --  . But it 's often this way . Someone disappears and suddenly everyone begins to love him . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Crawl away , you snail ! JOSEPH ( Irritated ) Odilon , say something . ODILON ( Philosophically ) I 've found that when Marie-Paule gets an idea into her head it stays there . What can I say ? ( JOSEPH sits down ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Furiously ) You want me to telephone Angele ? JOSEPH ( Stands up ) Why Angele ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) To tell her to come and get you and keep you . To tell her to make you stop bothering me . I 've had enough of you . I 'm fed up with you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joining MARIE-PAULE ( II ) .

( JOSEPH stands still , not knowing what to make of this outburst ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Shall I telephone ? JOSEPH But what  --  MARIE-PAULE ( II ) That 's enough ! JOSEPH ( Losing patience a little ) But what about the bar ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) make the same gesture with the back of their arm ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Have n't I paid for it ? Putting up with you for two years ? What more do I owe you ? ( JOSEPH tries to speak but no words come . He recognizes at last the end of this episode . He leaves . ) ( ODILON , seeing a new opening for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) until she looks at him ) ODILON So here we are again , hey ? You and me . Not so bad , is it ? I 've always admired you  --  even at your worst . But today you were at your best . That attitude ! And the way you handled the little bean . Very dignified , very honorable . That Joseph , he had his share of good points , but now that he 's gone I can tell you . The two of us never got along . He was a snob . Did n't handle his part of the situation too well . We 're lucky to be rid of him . p. 118 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) We ? I 'm getting rid of you , too . ODILON ( Confidently ) Oh no . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Out ! ODILON Hold on a minute .

MARIE-PAULE ( II ) leaves . The bar rolls off and is replaced by a set representing the lounge of the Hotel Negresco in Nice .

MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I have to think so . THE CROUPIER But excuse me . How did you know it was a girl ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Irritated ) I knew later , of course , when she was born ! THE CROUPIER Of course ! What 's the matter with me ? I was going to say Although , you know , it seems that these days there are doctors who claim they can tell sometimes as far as  --  MARIE-PAULE ( I ) A child . That put a new face on things . I wanted to save her . I wanted to give her a real father , the right kind  --  so she 'd never know that sickness of fear . So she 'd feel secure  --  from the day she was born . You 're born secure  --  or you 're not . So I sold the bar , and I went down to Nice . The Hotel Negresco . THE CROUPIER Now , that 's what I call a coincidence . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a cousin who 's the assistant concierge . A second cousin , really , And second assistant concierge , really . You know who I mean ? A dark fellow .

( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) comes into the Negresco lounge . She wears a full white coat . She studies the TWO MEN , hesitates , and consults MARIE-PAULE ( I ) with a look . At this moment the FAT MAN turns away from the center and lights a cigar .

This day it was a newspaper that happened to be lying there . Otherwise , it might have been that other one . Who was he ? ( A shrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and ARMAND look at each other ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( TO ARMAND ) Oh , I 'm sorry , is this yours ? ( The tone of her voice has changed . She is posing as a girl of somewhat higher class than her own ) ARMAND ( Embarrassed ) No matter , no matter , Mademoiselle . ( A pause ) Thank you . ( A pause ) You 're more than welcome , I assure you . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Charmingly ) I 'm not quite sure I want to read at all . But what can one do in this weather ? ARMAND Quite true , quite true . ( A pause ) And they say that here on the Riviera the weather is always fine . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( Great interest ) They do ? ARMAND Yes . And then a day such as today . p. 122 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Rainy days have their own pleasures . ARMAND Yes . ( A pause ) They do ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( She puts down the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading 's all right when the news is interesting . That is , reading newspapers .

ARMAND The recipes . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) When there are any . ARMAND Of course . ( A pause ) But when there are n't any , how can you read them ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Now you 're making fun of me . Is that kind ? ARMAND ( Alarmed ) Me , Mademoiselle ? Oh , no I only meant When there are n't any , you see ( He pulls himself together ) So you 're interested in recipes . p. 123 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Well , I am a woman . A girl . ARMAND ( Profoundly ) A girl is a woman , Mademoiselle . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Do you mean that to be as bold as it sounds , Monsieur ? ARMAND No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the promise of womanhood Nothing more ( He gains courage ) Did I offend you ? But it 's over now , is n't it ? Please tell me it 's over . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) It 's over . ARMAND ( Sitting down again , crossing his arms and plunging deeper into conversation ) Do you like the movies ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh , I love them ! ARMAND We might go , then . I wonder what 's playing ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) To the movies ? With a young man ? I do n't think  --  ARMAND Why these days , people think nothing of it , Mademoiselle . Not in a resort such as this . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) I ca n't imagine what my mother would think . ARMAND ( Mischievously ) Well , do you have to tell her ? Could n't we just slip away ? Where is your mother right now ? p. 124 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) In Carcassonne . ARMAND ( Astonished ) Did you say Carcassonne ?

Presently THE OTHER MAN leaves , too ) THE CROUPIER Neatly played , Ma'am Marie-Paule . Congratulations . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) No  --  I was stumbling , feeling my way  --  from day to day . p. 125 THE CROUPIER But your instincts were working perfectly . Nothing more important than instincts .

He comes to , suddenly . ) Allow me to present you to my mother . ARMAND 'S MOTHER How do you do , Mademoiselle ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) comes forward and offers her hand . THE MOTHER takes it .

My son has spoken so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be perfectly candid and confess that for the past two weeks he 's talked of nothing else . ( A polite little laugh all around ) That is why I was so anxious to meet you . You do understand , do n't you ? Our Armand is so naive . p. 126 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) The vulgarity of those people ! No delicacy . No tact . Saying whatever comes into their heads . ARMAND Really , Mother ! I 'm thirty-four years old . ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( Firmly ) Naivete is not a matter of age . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Bravo ! Well said , mama-in-law . THE CROUPIER Mama-in-law ? Ah , so it worked out . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Naturally . THE CROUPIER And rather upper class people , eh ? I can see that right away . That mother there , she has that manner . She 's no nouveau riche . These days MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And no aristocrat , either . But well off . A huge factory . THE CROUPIER ( Interested ) Manufacturing what , Ma'am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bouvard Biscuits . You never heard of them ? THE CROUPIER Bouvard Biscuits ? ( It all begins to dawn on him ) But of course , Madame Bouvard . Why did n't you ever tell me before ? Of course I know Bouvard Biscuits . And , of course , I know you , Madame Bouvard . That 's your name . But why is it I never connected you with the biscuits ? Bouvard Biscuits . Well , I should say I do know Bouvard Biscuits . My little grandson , when he had his stomach condition , that 's all they allowed us to feed him . It seems they 're good for that . Full of glucose  --  or is it gluten ? Do you think  --  ( But again he is interrupted ) p. 127 ARMAND 'S MOTHER Armand tells me that your parents live in Carcassonne . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Yes , Ma'am . ARMAND 'S MOTHER Ah , Carcassonne ! What a pretty town . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) Here it comes again . THE CROUPIER What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins . ( But ARMAND 'S MOTHER says nothing more . She simply looks at MARIE-PAULE ( II ) and smiles ) Is n't she going to say it ? I 'd have bet on it ! ARMAND 'S MOTHER In the evening , particularly . The sunset . THE CROUPIER You think there can be something in old ruins not liking to talk about other old ruins ? ARMAND 'S MOTHER Our Armand has a tendency to see everything through rose-colored glasses . But this time I 'm happy to see that he is not wrong . ( Having thus delivered herself , she sighs contentedly . ARMAND and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) are gratefully relieved ) I 'm keeping you . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Oh , no Madame . ARMAND 'S MOTHER Yes , you should go out . p. 128 MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Please come with us . ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( Impressed ) How very good of you .

Imagine talking about a three months engagement  --  with my young lady on the way . Well , put yourself in my place . ( Unseen by ARMAND 'S MOTHER , ARMAND and MARIE-PAULE ( II ) come in and go to an area upstage ) ( MARIE-PAULE , invitingly ) MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Would n't you like to come in ? ARMAND ( Terrified ) Is n't it too late ? MARIE-PAULE ( II ) Yes , it is . But there 's such a view from my balcony at night . Well , if you do n't want to , of course . ( THEY go through the door , quickly ) ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) , punctuating it ) p. 129 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on safer ground . After that it did n't take long . ( MOTHER comes on ) ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( On the telephone ) Yes , my dear , it 's quite true . My little Armand is married No , he 's thirty-four ! Rushed ? Not at all . They 've known each other for  --  weeks You know my little Armand . Once he wants something  --  he has it all his way . Oh , yes , a lovely girl . So superior . With a fine career in Paris which she is giving up No , Armand does n't want his wife to work Oh , but it was very small and very very private  --  otherwise , of course , you know you would have been with us  --  you of all people Her parents ? Carcassone  --  oh , yes , a fine old family  --  in the coal business , I believe very well thought of . And set up a fine dowry for her Oh yes , most distinguished , extremely charming No , I have n't met them personally But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the backwoods that the treasures are to be found No , they did n't they could n't because they actually she , that is  --  . Well , to tell you the truth , I never did get it quite clear  --  but they did n't come They 're simple people , you see  --  oh yes , rich but simple  --  and Armand thought that in our crowd they might have felt no , not out of place exactly  --  good hearted people are never out of place anywhere . But they might have felt ill-at-ease No , not ill  --  ill at ease So complicated , uniting two families The friends of one , the friends of the other My own marriage  --  fifty years of it and there are some relatives of my husband 's I never did get to meet The main thing is she and little Armand love each other  --  and speaking of love each other  --  can you keep a secret ? Promise ? Swear ? Very well , then , ( She looks about )  --  G-R-A-N-D-M-O-T-H-E  --  no , wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mind , I 'm sick of it  --  you know what I 'm going to be ! Goodbye ! ( She hangs up ) p. 130 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And there you are . Marriage . THE CROUPIER You do n't seem too happy about it . Of course , the night before my marriage , I did n't feel too frisky , either . I tried to reason with myself . I said to myself , ' Come on , Oscar , everybody has to do it . ' No use . I felt pretty depressed about the whole thing . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) There were time I wondered if I had n't mistaken the ceremony . Instead of married , I felt buried . Buried alive  --  and anonymous . Buried twice . I did n't have the right to look back and have memories . I had to keep watching myself all the time . Buried , but it was n't me that was buried . You see what a complication . Then , from time to time , a word  --  some damned word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost for a moment , and become myself and see them all around me exchanging looks . Buried , I tell you . Here they are . A view of the family vault . ( On these words , an upper-middle class French drawing room rolls on . ARMAND sits there ; and BERTHE , his sister ; and ERNEST , her husband . ARMAND 'S MOTHER joins the scene , continuing to read her newspaper . In the background there is a proper little MAID with a tray on which is a silver coffee pot . MARIE-PAULE ( II ) now dressed exactly the same as MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and wearing the same jewelry , takes the tray , puts it on the table , and stands immobile with everyone else . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) rises slowly , with resigned decision , takes the pink silk stole from her shoulders and puts it over the back of her chair . She begins to pull off her long black gloves ) p. 131 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Continuing ) Well , here it is . ( She sighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CROUPIER Where , Ma'am Marie-Paule ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Into the vault . She 's caught up with me , that one . ( She takes a few steps toward the drawing room which appears to be waiting for her . She stops and turns back to THE CROUPIER ) I know it 's stupid , but I find it hard . ( She takes a deep breath and goes toward MARIE-PAULE ( II ) who , of all the characters in the scene , is the only one who seems to be aware of her presence . THEY stand facing each other for a long moment . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) , gently and firmly , takes the coffee pot from MARIE-PAULE ( II ) ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) , gently ) Go along now . We 're finished with you . ( MARIE-PAULE ( II ) still looking at her , begins to walk slowly backwards toward the downstage exit . In the wings she stops and raises a hand in farewell ) Goodbye Yes adieu , ma jeunesse ! Goodbye , my youth Never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outs down the coffee pot and comes back to THE CROUPIER ) I ca n't do it , M'sieu Oscar . I ca n't . It tears me apart . p. 132 THE CROUPIER Courage , Ma'am Marie-Paule . It 's only a little of the past you 're losing . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Pointing to the drawing room with a shudder ) But look at them .  --  THE CROUPIER ( Philosophically ) It 's a family .  --  MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Looking toward Marie-Paule ( II ) It 's her he loved  --  Jacquot . Not me . THE CROUPIER There 's no more Jacquot . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And she has n't done half of what I wanted her to do . THE CROUPIER She did n't do too badly . A husband , a car , a position , a maid . Remember your mother 's advice ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Two maids . THE CROUPIER You see ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) What good is all that to me ? There 's no more coal to carry up , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what I buried myself alive for ? Not to have to carry buckets of coal in a world where there are n't any more buckets of coal ? THE CROUPIER ( Gently ) But you have to think of your little girl , Ma'am Marie-Paule What did you call her ? p. 133 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Jeannine ( To MARIE-PAULE ( II ) All right , go . ( She smiles ) I 'll manage somehow . ( To THE CROUPIER , with fury ) Somehow ! ( And MARIE-PAULE ( II ) disappears . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) goes back into the drawing room , picks up the coffee pot , pours a cup of coffee for the MOTHER . With her first words , the room comes to life ) ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) , to the maid , harshly ) Mademoiselle Jeannine kicked her covers off again in her crib . I thought I told you to watch her . And in the dining room this morning there was dust under the curtains . This coffee is warm , not hot , warm ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MAID ) Now , go along and heat it ! Quickly , understand ? ( THE MAID , terrified , takes the coffee pot and goes out ) ERNEST ( A soft type ) I must say , Marie-Paule , with you around , things certainly march ! ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( Who has lost much of her power ) The coffee was really quite hot enough for me . BERTHE ( A birdlike one ) My way with servants is to pretend to see nothing . I certainly do n't want to find my head on the end of a pole . ( She giggles ) p. 134 ARMAND ( To Ernest ) I do n't want to hurry you , Ernest , but remember that at two o'clock the Liverpool order has to leave . ERNEST ( Very relaxed ) They can do it without me . ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( Complacently ) Oh , Ernest , you do like to linger over you coffee , do n't you ? ARMAND The last time we made that shipment , you were n't there , either . It cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAID comes hurrying back in with the coffee things ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Monsieur Ernest first , and quickly . ERNEST ( sarcastically ) What did I ever to to deserve so much attention from you , dear sister-in-law ? ( His coffee is served . He puts it down on the table , picks up a cigarette , taps it , lights it , and settles down ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Liverpool is waiting for you . ARMAND ( Embarrassed ) No , no , I only suggested that  --  ERNEST ( Trying to joke ) And what about my drop of cognac ? You know that without my drop of cognac I simply do n't exist . ( Exasperated , MARIE-PAULE ( I ) goes over to ERNEST , and hands him his cup . Subdued , ERNEST drinks it quickly , and chokes . He gets up , kisses his WIFE on the top of her head and goes out . There is an embarrassed silence ) p. 135 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To ARMAND ) And what about you , are n't you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? ARMAND Well , it 's Ernest . Berthe will tell you . If I follow him , he 'll think I 'm trying to supervise him . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) That 's no reason . ARMAND All right , I 'm going . ( He gets up and goes , a completely dominated man ) ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( Taking her courage in her hands ) You 're too hard on Armand . His health is delicate . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Delicate iron . ARMAND 'S MOTHER Then why does he look so tired ? Forgive me . Is it absolutely necessary to send him to the factory at eight o'clock every morning ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Doing things my way , do you know what we made this year ? Seventeen million more than last . Does n't that mean anything to you ? ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( Surrendering ) Quite right , quite right , it 's wrong of me to interfere . Well , I think this afternoon Berthe and I will take ourselves out to a good movie . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She catches herself and continues in a somewat easier tone ) I 'm expecting a visit from Madame Desvaux . She 'll be piqued if she finds you 're out . BERTHE Madame Desvaux ? Thanks for the warning . I 'll be somewhere , I do n't know where , but somewhere . That woman is the bore of the year . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) She can get us the order from the Bureau of Asylums . Asylums need plenty of biscuits . ARMAND 'S MOTHER You never stop , do you ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And I 'm also expecting Madame Thonnard . ARMAND 'S MOTHER No , no . Now there , Marie-Paule , you are quite wrong . We really can not receive her . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Why not ? ARMAND 'S MOTHER Her reputation . No , this time I really must put my foot down . BERTHE She even tried with Ernest . In the middle of a dinner . She looked over at him and went like this  --  . ( She puts her finger to her temple , simulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't come to her she 'd shoot herself . That 's the kind she is . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And her husband is the kind who runs the Army Commissary . And the army is hungry , too  --  for biscuits . They may as well eat ours . p. 137 ARMAND 'S MOTHER No movie , then ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) No movie . ARMAND 'S MOTHER And I was so looking forward to my eskimo pie . ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) goes to the roulette table to pick up her bag ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Once you learn to run things , you can run things . A bar , a love affair , a family , it 's all the same trick ! All you need is a birch and the ability to use it . THE CROUPIER Same with a roulette wheel . Same with fishing . ( MADAME DESVAUX and MADAME THONNARD make a spectacular entrance . MADAME DESVAUX is an overfed , noisy woman . MADAME THONNARD is desiccated , all teeth , a true eccentric ) MARIE-PAULE ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Thonnard . Together . How amusing ? We were just speaking of you . ARMAND 'S MOTHER Were your ears tingling a little ? MADAME DESVAUX You 'll never think who we met outside . Your little Jeannine . She was just coming home from school . What a delicious child ! And that blue she was wearing , how it becomes her . She 's a real little red riding hood . ( THE LADIES sit down in a sort of semi-circle . THE MAID brings in the tea and ARMAND 'S MOTHER begins to serve . THE CROUPIER snaps his fingers to attract MARIE-PAULE 'S attention and she turns toward him ) p. 138 THE CROUPIER One moment . Did n't I hear her say your little girl was coming home from school ? ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) nods ) But just a moment ago you spoke of her as a baby in her crib MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Time flies , M'sieu Oscar , time flies . It has nothing else to do . MADAME THONNARD ( To ARMAND 'S MOTHER , who is pouring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water . I 'm too nervous as it is . Sometimes I 'm so nervous that I send out waves . ARMAND 'S MOTHER Really ? MADAME THONNARD It 's a quality I got from my father . He was a magistrate , you know . Full of waves . He 'd sit there on the bench and suddenly : Aah ! ( She stiffens and opens her mouth wide . After a moment ) Whenever that happened , the waves meant the person before him was guilty . BERTHE Made his job quite simple , did n't it ? MADAME THONNARD Of course . He never had to read anything , or even listen . He just waited for the waves . That 's why they never appointed him to a higher court . Too valuable where he was . ( The conversation proceeds apace , no line particularly connected with any other ) p. 139 MADAME DESVAUX ( Swiftly ) Oh , yes , very pleasant the trip , very pleasant . And Sweden , very pretty . No , no , I assure you it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The capital is beautiful , very beautiful . The capital , you know , what is it called ? I know , of course . The name of the capital is Sweden . The capital of Sweden is , oh , is n't this silly of me ? ARMAND 'S MOTHER The capital of Sweden ? BERTHE The capital ? ( THEY are all thinking hard ) THE CHAMBERMAID Stockholm , Madame . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And who asked you for your opinion ? ( THE MAID scurries out ) MADAME DESVAUX Oh , no . I do n't agree with you . I do n't agree with you at all , Marie-Paule . I find this thirst for culture touching , very touching . Especially in the common people . ( She makes a facial expression which contradicts her vocal tone ) MADAME THONNARD ( Dreamily ) But the first man , does he leave a mark forever ? That 's what I keep asking myself . BERTHE And everyone knows her little George is really one she had by the chauffeur. p. 140 MADAME DESVAUX I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And imagine , serving an onion omelet . Horrendous when you think of it . ARMAND 'S MOTHER I do n't mind an onion omelet so long as it has n't got too much onion in it . MADAME DESVAUX Oh , what a week I 've been though . My Pekinese . You remember my Pekinese . Well , suddenly , a hernia . I had to take him to the veterinary . He really is quite ill . I have to hold him on the potty to do his little duty . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Who ? The veterinary ? MADAME DESVAUX ( Howling ) Marie-Paule ! I often say to my husband , you can never be bored around Marie-Paule . The veter  --  ( She can not finish the word for laughing ) MADAME THONNARD Is he a charmer ? ARMAND 'S MOTHER ( Aimlessly ) The more things change , the more they stay the same . MADAME THONNARD I said to her , Adele , I said  --  . BERTHE Birds of a feather , of course . ( She laughs a pearly laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all very well , but too much is too much . MADAME DESVAUX You have n't ! You have n't changed your hairdresser . ( To MADAME THONNARD ) Did you hear that ? Did you ? Marie-Paule is no longer with George . That 's going to cause talk . Talk about talk . ( The tempo of the conversation accelerates ) BERTHE And during my very first delivery MADAME DESVAUX The doctor said to me : Madame Desvaux MADAME THONNARD And there I was expecting little Felix . In my third month ARMAND 'S MOTHER In your third month already ? MADAME THONNARD Because I was so nervous MADAME DESVAUX Ice cream , ice cream , nothing but ice cream . Otherwise , nausea , nothing but nausea . MADAME THONNARD Like my father . My father , the magistrate . MADAME DESVAUX Nausea . It was enough for me just to see someone eating ice cream . ARMAND 'S MOTHER Oh , how I miss my eskimo pie ! MADAME THONNARD But , as my doctor always says to me , he says : Oh , Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , in my sixth month , it all began again MADAME THONNARD And then the kidneys MADAME DESVAUX My stomach ARMAND 'S MOTHER My tubes BERTHE My miscarriage . ARMAND 'S MOTHER My eskimo pie . MADAME THONNARD And bulges , great fat bulges . It was appalling ! MADAME DESVAUX Still one must go to the people . That 's what my husband always says . The minute you stop going to the people MADAME THONNARD And then it moved to my hips . And I had to have massages , daily . ( Ecstatically ) Oh , those hands of his , he had such hands . MADAME DESVAUX Nausea . Nothing but nausea . ( Suddenly THEY all rise and leave ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To THE CROUPIER ) The social graces ! There you are , M'sieu Oscar  --  the social graces . Indecent , that 's what they are . They drove me wild . Day after day and night after night . You know what I used to do when those sessions were over ? Just for relief ? I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random  --  call them up and get everything off my chest . p. 143 THE CROUPIER ( Enthusiastically ) Like me with my fish ! Compensation . ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) in the center of the stage , pretends to pick up a telephone ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Hello ? May I speak to Madame La Contesse ? Oh , it is ? Well you old pushover  --  are you still working the side-walks ? Why do n't you stop trying to sell it and start giving it away ? ( During the above THE CROUPIER picks up his table rake and sits up on the back of his chair pretending to fish . He overlaps with MARIE-PAULE ) THE CROUPIER Come on , you son-of-a-bitch , bite ! Bite , you bastard , or I 'll dive down there and shove the hook right up your rosette . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Overlapping ) Is this the Duchesse ? The old bedspread herself ? Never mind who . Is you husband still at it with the cook ? THE CROUPIER ( Overlapping ) Oh , you little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugger . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Good evening , Madame des Longchamps So Mademoiselle your daughter is expecting ? Well , if you ever find out who the father is  --  let me know ! THE CROUPIER You call yourself a carp , you louse ! p. 144 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You have n't any daughter ? What the hell do I care ? It 's probably you with the plumber . Let me speak to your son the fairy . What ? Well , up yours , dear ! ( She hangs up and turns to THE CROUPIER ) Ha ! THE CROUPIER ( Simultaneously ) Ha ! Feel better , Ma'am Marie-Paule ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Better . ( He returns to the floor . THEY laugh together for a while , totally relieved of tension . JEANNINE comes twirling in . She is a girl of eighteen and shows the unmistakable signs of a superior upbringing . She is proper and conventional , with a slight antiseptic air ) JEANNINE Mama ! ( She models her dress ) Like this ? I do . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I ) Let me see . Turn around , Yes . ( She moves to her daughter and straightens a pleat . She gives off an air of wonderment as she regards this strange creature who is her daughter , wearing a dress which would have been different had she supervised it ) ( ARMAND comes in ) ARMAND ( Smiling ) Well , what have we here ? A problem , I see . Any day now I wo n't be able to go out walking with her without eye-brows lifting all around . Who 's going to believe that this beauty is my daughter ? p. 145 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Embarrassed , she addresses JEANNINE ) What you need with that dress is a necklace . Pearls , to pick it up . See if you can wheedle one out of you father for your birthday . ARMAND Excellent advice , Jeannine . Come and wheedle me . ( He holds out his arms . Jeannine comes to him and THEY embrace , full of deep feeling and mutual pride ) JEANNINE I have to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Where tonight ? JEANNINE Jean-Francois . I have a new dress , he has a new car . We 'll have to find something new to do . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Jean-Francois ? JEANNINE Renson , you know . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) The silk people ? ARMAND Eugene Renson 's boy . Perfectly all right . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To JEANNINE ) Remember what I told you , they 're not to kiss you . Not yet . JEANNINE Do n't worry about that . It would make me laugh too much . ( She is in the doorway ) Oh , I wo n't be in for dinner . Jean-Francois ' had a windfall and he 's taking me somewhere grande luxe . ( She goes out ) p. 146 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( To ARMAND ) What did she mean it would make her laugh ? It never made me laugh . ARMAND She 's not you , you know . ( He moves toward her ) So , here we are with a daughter who dresses up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner and , for a fact , sometimes does n't even ask permission any more That does something to me . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And to me . ( She pauses and then continues , almost shyly ) But what ? Something sad , or gay ? ARMAND I do n't know . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) But you are happy , are n't you ? ARMAND Let me see . I have a lovely wife and a sweet daughter . Health good . Business better . ( He kisses MARIE-PAULE 'S hand ) Yes , my love , thanks to you , I think I can honestly say that I 'm happy . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Well , that 's the main thing . ( She takes a step toward THE CROUPIER while ARMAND goes out ) That makes one , anyway . THE CROUPIER No , surely more than that , Ma'am Marie-Paule . Your daughter . She seems to breathe happiness , that child . p. 147 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Yes , for the moment . Until it changes . The trouble is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes its time . She was happy , yes . A year , two years , three years Time races , M'sieu Oscar , how it races . Sometimes I say wait , wait  --  for God 's sake , not so quick . No use . ( ARMAND comes striding in ) ARMAND Do you know what 's happened ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) No . ARMAND Jeannine . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Startled ) An accident ? I told you not to give her that car . ARMAND No , no . Who said anything about an accident ? It 's much simpler . She 's in love . And she wants to get married . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Ridiculous . She 's too young . ARMAND ( Gently ) You 're the only one who thinks so . She 's twenty-one . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) But it was only the other day ( Toward THE CROUPIER ) Twenty-one , you see ? It went by in a moment . ( To ARMAND ) How do you know ? ARMAND What , my love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get married . ARMAND She just told me . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And why not me ? ARMAND Always the way . A father and daughter little confidences . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Touched ) Ah , yes . ( A pause ) Money ? ARMAND What ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) This boy  --  does he have money ? ARMAND ( Gently chiding ) You have n't even asked who he is . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) When you tell me about his money , I 'll tell you who he is . ARMAND Rest your mind . It 's Mollard . ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) makes the suitable , impressed expression ) Yes , that 's right . The pharmaceutical Mollards . Can you believe it ? You remember when he was first around here ? I tell you honestly now , I had little twinges of jealousy because it seemed to me he was always flirting with you . And you see , it turned out to be only because of Jeannine . He has a head on him , that boy . If 149 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't very important these days . We simply stand around and nod our heads and shower blessings . No reason not to . This Mollard is a fine boy . Let 's admit it , my dear . She 's made a magnificent match . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Oh , yes . ARMAND So . We only have to invite him here to dinner . He 'll speak to me I 'll speak to him . For what little we have to say . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) All right . Go on . Invite him to dinner . ( ARMAND goes out , MARIE-PAULE ( I ) returns to THE CROUPIER ) Because even in the best of society , you have to feed them on top of everything else ! Pharmaceuticals . Have you any idea what that means . Pharmaceuticals in our time ? That 's really something So , the dinner , the engagement , the wedding . For three months all we did in that house was get married . Two hundred people I thought of Jacquot And , then  --  then ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 'll never believe it . After one year . What am I saying ? Not even one year . He was unfaithful to Jeannine . If that is n't enough to make you cry . A beautiful little thing like that . Having seen her , can you believe it ? THE CROUPIER I 've seen her , but I have n't seen him . p. 150 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You will . THE CROUPIER I 've come to believe , Ma'am Marie-Paule , that the rich have no conscience . One day , right here at this very table MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Do n't misunderstand me . Husbands are unfaithful , it 's their way . But they 're supposed to be clever about it . Not this one , no . He was too important to take the trouble to hide it . No consideration . ( JEANNINE comes in . Her hair is worn up and she wears a necklace . She comes toward her MOTHER , distraught ) JEANNINE Mama ! MARIE-PAULE ( I ) My baby . JEANNINE With a bar woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common bar woman . I went down there , I saw her . She must weigh two hundred pounds . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Weight has nothing to do with it . How did you find out ? JEANNINE Everyone knows about it . Everybody . Finally Giselle gave me the address . My friend Giselle . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Friend . JEANNINE I went down to see her . I had to . She runs a bar in the rue Caumartin . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Did you speak to her ? p. 151 JEANNINE I could n't . I just looked at her . Horrified . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And now you 're in misery . JEANNINE Oh , Mama . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Send him here to me . This tomcat of yours . I 'll give him a dry cleaning . JEANNINE Mama . Help me . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You really want him back ? JEANNINE I think so . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Well , no matter . If not , you can always get a divorce and we 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head ) No , no . Oh , no . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Go on , now . Tell him I have to see him . That it 's very important . But do n't say why . ( JEANNINE goes out . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) girds her loins , then continues to THE CROUPIER ) A bar woman . Curious ? The whole thing began to excite me , I 'll admit that . Funny ? It was  --  refreshing . Could I do it ? How ? ( MOLLARD comes in . He is an attractive but somewhat sensual looking young man . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) attacks him at once , brutally , her old self coming to the surface ) So ! Bounce around with bar women now , do we ? Very proper , eh ? Why not with a human cannonball out of the circus ? Or a bearded lady ? How about a policewoman ? There 's an idea . Have you ever tried a midget ? Just for a change , why not ? You clumsy clown ! To think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's all this about ? Come on now , speak up ! p. 152 MOLLARD ( Trying to retain his dignity ) What 's there to say ? You seem to know all about it . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I know more than all about it . MOLLARD If you 'll forgive me , why is n't this more your daughter 's business ? ( He takes a cigarette case out of his pocket and offers it to her . SHE slaps it out of his hand roughly . It goes flying across the room ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You 're talking to me , Monsieur Mollard . And my daughter 's business is my business . Understand ? Do n't you get stiff with me . MOLLARD  --  not a question of stiff . ( His dignity fails him ) You think I like it this way ? You think I 'm proud of myself ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And everything going so well ! You fool , what came over you ? All right , if it had happened after five or six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , right away Is it a sickness of some sort ? Do n't you love her ? MOLLARD I thought I did . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Then you could have thought so a little longer . It 's done . It 's a matter of trying . People try . p. 153 MOLLARD No , no , it 's no use . I made a mistake with her . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You made more than one . With her and with me and with that fat cow . MOLLARD ( Confused ) What ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) You 're full of mistakes ! I thought in pharmaceuticals you had to be exact , not so ? If you make as many mistakes in your business as you 've made here , you 'll kill millions ! MOLLARD ( Bitterly ) So it 's all my fault . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Sarcastically ) No , it 's mine . MOLLARD ( Turning away ) Maybe . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Looking at him ) What did you say ? MOLLARD Nothing . ( THEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting up in a stool . MOLLARD is leaning against the bar , facing her ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( In a new tone ) Look here , Mollard . I always had the feeling that we two  --  son-in-law , mother-in-law  --  that we got along pretty well . Maybe because we 're two of a kind , in a way . Is n't that true ? It 's a difficult relationship , God knows , but it did n't seem so for us. p. 154 MOLLARD No . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Then why do n't we take advantage of that ? And speak out , frankly . MOLLARD You 're sure you want to ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Yes , I am . MOLLARD How frankly ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Go ahead . MOLLARD ( Beginning slowly ) You know what people say . Before you marry a girl , take a good look at her mother . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And ? MOLLARD ( Quietly ) I did . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( A bit shaken but in full control ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Sensible . MOLLARD In fact , it encouraged me . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Very sensible . ( Seriously ) And the result of all this ? What did I lead you to believe ? MOLLARD Nothing . But you did make me hope a little . p. 155 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Hope ? MOLLARD I 'm no fool . I know you think I am , but I 'm not . I saw what Jeannine was like . What she had and what she did n't have . But I hoped that after we were married  --  that she 'd become more like you . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) In what way ? MOLLARD A woman . That she 'd become a woman . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) But is n't she ? A beautiful woman ? MOLLARD Let me ask you something . How did you bring her up ? What did you feed her on ?  --  to turn her into this little cream-puff . Huh ? This little creampuff that walks and talks and moves and dresses and undresses and never gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always knows exactly what to say . Yes , Madame . No , Madame . Excellency . General . How do you do ? Good morning . So nice of you to come . But she does n't realize that there are other things to say and that sometimes just to say them is n't enough . That sometimes you have to scream or shout or cry out , or cry . Do you know how much she weighs , your daughter ? I 'll tell you . Nothing , she weighs nothing , because she is n't even alive . Now you , you 're alive . And so am I , damn it all . At least , I want to be . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And your human cannonball , down there in the bar ? I suppose she 's alive . p. 156 MOLLARD Yes , she is , if you want to know . You 're alive , you 're about something , you care about things . You get furious , your blood rushes through your veins . You do n't waste time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very short and there 's no time to be wasted . No , not on all the goddam nonsense she occupies herself with . The drawing room , the dining room , the bedroom . And the bathroom . Oh , yes , especially the bathroom . Always the bathroom . Always gilding the lily . Scrubbing and cleaning and polishing and painting . Of course , she 's pretty . I did n't say she was n't pretty . Everyone envies me . They do n't know . And do n't misunderstand me . She has many , many good qualities . Except one . She 's charming . All day . But , unfortunately for her , God also created a thing called night . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Ah ! This is becoming more clear . So it 's the night that does n't work out for you , eh ? And it 's a little bit of night that you go looking for . MOLLARD I would n't have put it that way but  --  as you like , a little bit of night . MARIE-PAULE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was right . MOLLARD ( Exploding ) Why does she have to take after her father ? Instead of you ? MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Outraged ) Never mind her father ! You do n't know him . p. 157 MOLLARD I certainly do n't . I do n't understand how someone like that could have held on to someone like you all these years . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Thanks for the compliment . But I do n't need it . I do n't want it . All I want is for my daughter to be happy . ( A pause ) So you made a mistake , did you ? Well , that 's too bad . Just put on a mask and pretend ! Like everyone else does . Look here , that girl loves you and I want you to love her . That 's important to me , understand ? That 's my life . I wo n't have her kicked around like  --  never mind . Now , listen . Your human cannonball , you 'll do me the favor of dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIE-PAULE ( I ) And then we 'll see . MOLLARD I can tell you . In three months I wo n't be able to stick it and there 'll be another one . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Nothing without your little bit of night . All you want is everything . You want to get more out of life than there is in it . You 've never known not having , that 's the trouble . So you ca n't be grateful for what you have . Your marriage is n't enough . There are people who have that little bit of night . And that 's all . Do they come to you and ask you for some of your good marriage ? p. 158 MOLLARD If I could . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Now , let me take charge here . The matters I 've managed in life I 've managed pretty well . ( There is a long pause during which MOLLARD looks at her . SHE continues ) So I made you hope . All right , to hell with hoping , we 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with the power of hidden feeling . She continues in an unreal voice ) We 'll find out if that 's what you want  --  and if it is I 'll see to it . Be patient , Mollard . I 'll see to it that she becomes what you want her to be . And meanwhile ( She holds out her hand ) But first I must know what you want her to be . In every way . Never mind the words and the hopes . What 's real is real . ( MOLLARD is pale ) What 's the matter , are you afraid ? I 'm not . I 'm not afraid of anything . Not any more . MOLLARD Marie-Paule MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Come here . ( MOLLARD comes closer ) What matters is what 's real . A little bit of night  --  those are only words , just words . ( HE reaches out and touches her shoulders , tentatively . SHE continues ) Whatever happens you 'll stay with Jeannine , you 'll make her happy ? p. 159 MOLLARD She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's you ! ( THEY cling to one another . ARMAND and JEANNINE appear . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) and MOLLARD are aware of being discovered . They separate , roughly , MARIE-PAULE ( I ) turns to her daughter ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Jeannine ! JEANNINE I hate you ! ( SHE runs out ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Jeannine ! ( SHE takes a step as though to follow , but stops and turns back to ARMAND and MOLLARD ) And now , gentlemen ? ( Silence . She turns to THE CROUPIER ) Believe me , M'sieu Oscar . It was impossible . Neither one of them dared to hold on to me , though they both wanted to . But the situation , you see , it made them seem inadequate . There I was . ( SHE turns to ARMAND ) Yes ? ARMAND ( Shocked ) But  --  your son-in-law ? Your own son-in-law . This is beyond me . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) I 'm sure it is . ( SHE turns to MOLLARD ) And what about you ? MOLLARD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 160 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) So , no pharmaceuticals today , either , eh ? ARMAND Go wherever you like . You 'll have an allowance . It will be more generous than you deserve . ( The set rolls off , carrying ARMAND with it . MOLLARD withdraws . The original unit set representing the Casino at Monte Carlo is reconstituted ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) For one moment where I was thinking of others  --  one moment  --  the single moment where I had pity for someone else . Pity , You can shove it  --  it 's out of pity you get caught  --  every time . That 's the trap . That and the fear of not having . But not having what ? ( SHE moves back to the gaming table . She puts on her gloves and her stole , picks up her chips and starts out . Stage center she stops , looks at the chips , bounces them up and down in her hand and returns to the table . She hands the chips to THE CROUPIER ) The twelve . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve . ( He puts the chips on the number and spins the wheel ) No more bets ! Rien ne va plus ! Now , there 's something real . Number twelve . ( From the other side of the stage , MONSIEUR GASTON has come back in ) Ma'am Marie-Paule Ma'am Marie-Paule He 's come back . p. 161 MARIE-PAULE ( I ) Who ? THE CROUPIER ( Carried away ) Vickers , Limited . ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) turns to see MONSIEUR GASTON putting down his yachtsman 's cap . He moves toward her to meet her in the center of the stage . He is carrying a large jewel box ) ( The roulette wheel stops ) Number six , even and low ! ( He rakes in the chips . MARIE-PAULE ( I ) makes a deprecating gesture toward the table and turns to the approaching MONSIEUR GASTON ) MARIE-PAULE ( I ) ( Shouting gaily ) Hop ! The good soup ! This way with the good soup ! ( MONSIEUR GASTON opens the box to display a ravishing necklace . MARIE-PAULE ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Place your bets , gentlemen ! Messieurs , faites vos jeux ! Gentlemen , place your bets ! Faites vos jeux , Messieurs ! ( MARIE-PAULE ( I ) is dangling the jewel . The circus music rises to a joyous crescendo )
