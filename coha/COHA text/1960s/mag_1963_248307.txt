" I want to battle , " Cleveland 's Paul Brown once said . " I want to beat the hell out of you . " And in 33 years , with Brown calling every play from the bench , his football teams beat practically everybody-at Ohio 's Massillon high school ( 80 wins . 8 losses . 2 ties ) , at Ohio State ( 18-8-1 ) , at the wartime Great Lakes Naval Station ( 15-5-2 ) . In 1946 he founded pro football 's Cleveland Browns . The Browns won four straight championships in the old All-America Conference , moved into the National Football League in 1950 and won seven conference titles , three N.F.L. championships . <P> This season Brown 's touch left him . Favored to win the eastern title , his Browns won only half of their 14 games . Last week pro football 's winningest coach was fired by Cleveland President Arthur Modell . " I knew this happened to other people . " said Brown . " But I never thought it could happen to me. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
