Twice last week the big U.S. Air Force hospital plane thundered north from La Paz to the Canal Zone , each time carrying strictly quarantined , desperately ill patients plucked from the hinterlands of Bolivia for transfer to the modern facilities of Gorgas Hospital . First to land were Wisconsin-born Dr. Ronald MacKenzie , 38 , and Panamanian Technician Angel Muoz , 42 . At Gorgas , the fearful diagnosis made in the field was confirmed : both were victims of a newly discovered and deadly disease , Bolivian hemorrhagic fever . By midweek , the C-130 with its doctor-nurse team had made another trip , carrying New Jersey-born Virologist Karl Johnson , 34 . He also had the fever . <P> The illnesses of these men recalled the stirring days of Walter Reed 's famous campaign against yellow fever in Cuba at the turn of the century , when one researcher died and others had close calls . For the two physicians and the technician had been working selflessly , at great risk , in an internationally supported crash program to pinpoint the cause of a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As Cold as Marble . When the fever began its rampages three years ago in Bolivia 's northeastern province of Beni , the dirt-poor villagers around San Joaquin called it " the black typhus . " But this was a far deadlier disease . It struck almost one-third of the population , and killed about one-third of its victims . Men and women of all ages were stricken . First came fever , chills and headache . Then , in many cases , an agonizing pain in the back , usually followed by a rash in the throat , tremor of the tongue and extremities , bleeding from tiny vessels around the eyes , and blood in the urine . After about a week , many of the victims turned as cold as a morgue slab before they died . Survivors presented a pitiable sight for weeks , with bleeding gums and persistent tremor , and often in a state of delirium or stupor . <P> Bolivian doctors concluded that the disease was a form of hemorrhagic fever similar to those already known from Manchuria , Korea , India and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of those from other lands ? And what animal or insect transmitted the virus to its human victims ? Bolivia asked the internationally sponsored Middle America Research Unit , based in Balboa with Arizona-born Dr. Henry K. Beye as its head , to mobilize its forces for a jungle war . <P> From Caribbean bases , the U.S. Air Force flew ten tons of supplies to Bolivia in March , and four tons of laboratory gear in May . The Bolivian air force flew it all to San Joaquin . There , a team of physicians , virologists , entomologists , and ecologists set to work . First , the disease detectives plotted where the fever victims had lived-and died . They put healthy monkeys in single cages and left them for days in the forest where four woodcutters had . I worked just before they became ill . They put other " sentinel " monkeys in houses left empty by the deaths of whole families of fever victims .
