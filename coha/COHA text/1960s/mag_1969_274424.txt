HE looks like something out of an early Happening . Or an Andy Warhol movie . Or one of those puckish pop art pieces of George Segal or Marisol . As a matter of fact , Henry Geldzahler can claim all that and more . He first came into public view-a quasi-somnambulant rotundity in prison stripes afloat in a rubber raft-in an Oldenburg Happening mounted in the swimming pool of a Manhattan health club . Next came instant stardom before a Warhol camera . His role : smoking a cigar for an interminable hour and a half . " I have a certain unusual look , " says Henry , and who would dispute him ? Marisol carved his rumpled pants and big black shades ( now replaced by granny glasses ) in three dimensions . David Hockney portrayed him as a prim , vested , bearded presence on a purple sofa . George Segal cast him in the ghostly , ghastly plaster that is his specialty , a dilapidated figure who looks for all the world to be waiting for Godot . <P> As the Met 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum 's most controversial acquisition in the last decade . No one in Manhattan 's ingrown art world elicits such studied veneration or unquotable outrage . One reason is that Henry has taken on the almost incompatible tasks of scout and judge . As scout , he strives to keep abreast , mingling familiarly with the most avant of the avantgardists . Huffing and puffing up countless stairs to artists ' studios by day , wining and dining with their patrons by night , he is equally at home in the scruffy lofts of Canal Street and the elegant appointments of the Dakota . But as a judge , he is obliged to keep a certain detachment-and it is on this score that he is most often criticized . Relentless in promoting artists he likes , Geldzahler is equally inflexible in ignoring those he does not . <P> Visceral Reaction . Probably the only person who ever nonplussed Henry was Salvador Dali . As Henry tells it , Dali invited him over to his St. Regis suite one winter afternoon to do his portrait . " We 'll begin by casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Geldzahler . " I want to do a gold head of you , " replied Dali , " and it 's going to have a tongue that wags . " Henry fled . <P> " I know I 'm seen as some kind of avant-garde fantasy , " says Geldzahler . Indeed , he relishes the role . He collects art deco objects as well as modern paintings , secretly yearns to go to Hollywood . Born in 1935 in Antwerp to a family of diamond merchants , he came to the <P> U.S. on the eve of World War II . An art history major at Yale , he spent a summer working at the Met . Five years later , he abandoned his Ph.D . thesis to spearhead the Met 's contemporary arts activities . His criterion for a work of art : " Memorability and a visceral physical reaction . For some people it 's in the heart , for others in the throat . Sometimes you might even throw up . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
