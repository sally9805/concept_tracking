Every Easter eve a vigil far older than Russia begins in the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord , located in the village of Peredelkino , a residence of the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church . At midnight the clergy and members of the congregation walk in procession around the church and enter through its main doors to celebrate the Resurrection . The Soviet authorities discourage religion , but they tolerate this rite-after a fashion . Alexander Solzhenitsyn describes the vigil at Peredelkino in the following story . It is published here in translation for the first time . <P> <P> WE are told by experts that , when painting in oils , we should not represent things exactly as they are : for this there exists color photography . We must , by means of broken lines and combinations of square and triangular planes , convey the idea of the thing rather than the thing itself . I ca n't for my part see how color photography could make a meaningful selection of figures and compose into a single image the Easter procession at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century after the Revolution . Yet that picture would explain a lot , even were it painted by the most old-fashioned methods and without the use of triangular planes . <P> Half an hour before the chimes begin , the scene outside the railings of the Patriarchal Church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord is like a wild party in the dance hall of a remote and dowdy workers ' settlement . Shrill-voiced girls in brightly colored scarves and slacks ( admittedly a few wear skirts ) stroll about in threes , in fives , push their way into the church . But the nave is crowded . The old women took their places early on Easter eve . They snap at each other and the girls come out . They circle around the courtyard , shout insolently , call each other from afar , and inspect the small green , pink and white flames lit outside the windows of the church and beside the tombs of canons and bishops . As for the boys-tough and mean-looking-all have an air of victory ( though what victories , except perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their 15 or 20 years ? ) . Nearly all are wearing caps ( the few who are bareheaded have n't taken theirs off here ) . One out of four is tipsy , one out of ten is drunk . Every other one is smoking , and so disgustingly , with his butt stuck to his lower lip ! So that long before the incense-in place of the incense-gray pillars of cigarette smoke rise from the church courtyard , with its electric lights , toward the Easter sky with its brown , motionless clouds .
