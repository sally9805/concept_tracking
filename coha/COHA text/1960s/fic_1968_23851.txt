43 YANDA a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer Translated by the author and Dorothea Straus The Peacock 's Tail stood on a side street not far from the ruins of a Greek Orthodox church and cemetery . It was a two-story brick building with a weather vane on its crooked roof , and a battered sign over its entrance depicting a peacock with a faded gold tail , The front of the inn housed a windowless tavern , dark as dusk on the sunniest mornings . No peasants were served there even on market days . The owner , Shalom Pintchever , had no patience with the peasants , their dances and wild songs . Neither he nor Shaindel , his wife , had the strength to wait on these ruffians , or later when they got drunk , to throw them out into the gutter . The Peacock 's Tail was a stopping place for squires , military men who were on their way to the Russian-Austrian border , and for salesmen who came to town to sell farm implements and goods from Russia .

Sometimes a preacher stopped there , or one of those travelers about whom the Lord alone knows what brought them there . The town coachman understood what kind of customers to bring to The Peacock 's Tail . When Shalom Pintchever , a stranger , bought the hotel , and with his wife came to live in the town , they brought with them a peasant woman called Yanda . Yanda would have been a beauty but for a face as pockmarked as a potato grater . She had black hair which she wore in a braid , white skin , a short nose , red cheeks , and eyes as black as cherries . Her bosom was high , her waist narrow , her hips rounded . She was a woman of great physical strength . She did all the work in the hotel : made the beds , washed the linen , cooked , dumped the chamber pots , and , in addition , visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shalom Pintchever would ask , slyly winking an eye under his bushy brows , ? 1968 by Isaac Bashevis Singer " With or without ? " The traveler understood and almost always answered . " With . " Shalom added the price to the bill . There were guests who invited Yanda to drink with them , or go for a walk , but she never accepted . Shalom Pintchever was not going to have them taking up her time , or turning her into a drunk . He had once and for all forbidden her to drink liquor , and she never touched a drop , not even a glass of beer on a hot summer day . Shalom had rescued her from a drunkard father and a stepmother . In return she served him without asking for pay . Every few months he would give her pocket money . Yanda would grab Shalom 's hand , kiss it , and hide the money in her stocking without counting it . From time to time she would order a dress , a pair of high-buttoned shoes , or buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , when she went to church , she invariably threw a coin into the alms box . Sometimes she brought a present for the priest , or a. candle to be lit for her patron saint , The old women objected to her entering a holy place , but she stood inside the door anyway . There was gossip that the priest was carrying on with her , even though he had a pretty housekeeper . The Jews accused Shalom Pintchever of keeping a bawdy house . When the women quarreled with Shaindel , they called her Yanda . But without Yanda Shalom would have been out of business . Three maids could not have done her work . Besides , most servants stole and had to be watched . Neither Shalom nor Shaindel could he bothered with that . Husband and wife were mourning an only daughter who had died in a fire in the town in which they had previously lived . Shaindel suffered from asthma , Shalom had sick kidneys . Yanda carried the burden of the hotel . Summertime she got up at daybreak , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 44 YANDA scrubbed floors , patched quilts and sheets , carried water from the well , even chopped wood when a woodchopper was not available . Shaindel was convinced Yanda would collapse from overwork . Husband and wife also feared that she might contract a contagious disease . But some devil or other impure power watched over her . Years passed , and she did not get sick , never even caught cold . Her employers did not stint on her food , but she preferred to eat the leftovers : cold soups , scraps of meat , stale bread . Shalom and Shaindel both suffered from toothaches , but Yanda had a mouth full of strong white teeth like a dog . She could crack peach pits with them . " She is not a human being , " Shaindel would say , " she 's a beast . " The women spat when Yanda passed by , cursing her vehemently . Boys called her names and threw stones and mud at her . Young girls giggled , dropped their eyes , and blushed when they met her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in for questioning . But years passed and Yanda remained in Shalom Pintchever 's service . With time the clientele of the inn changed . As long as the town belonged to Russia , its guests were mainly Russians . Later , when the Austrians took over , they were Germans , Magyars , Czechs , and Bosnians . Then , when Poland gained independence , it served the Polish officials who arrived from Warsaw and Lublin , What did n't the town live through  --  epidemics of typhoid and dysentery ; the Austrian soldiers brought cholera with them and six hundred townspeople perished . For a short time , under Bolshevik rule , the inn was taken over by a Communist County Committee , and some commissar or other was put in charge . Yanda remained through it all . Somebody had to work , to wash , scour , serve the guests beer , vodka , snacks . Whatever their titles , at night the men wanted Yanda in their beds . There were some who kissed her and some who beat her . There were those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her and confessed to her as if she were a priest . One officer placed a glass of cognac on her head and shot it down with his revolver . Another bit into her shoulder and like a leech sucked her blood . Still , in the morning she washed , combed her hair , and everything began anew . There was no end to the dirty dishes . The floors were full of holes and cracks , the walls were peeling . No matter how often Yanda poured scalding water over cockroaches and bedbugs , and used all kinds of poison , the vermin continued to multiply . Each day the hotel was in danger of falling apart . It was Yanda who kept it together . The owners themselves began to resemble the hotel . Shaindel grew bent and her face became as white and brittle as plaster . Her speech was unintelligible . She no longer walked , but shuffled . She would find a discarded caftan in a trunk and would try to patch it . Shalom protested that he did n't need the rag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , with her glasses on the tip of her nose , trying to mend it . Again and again , she would ask Yanda to thread the needle , muttering , " It is n't thread , it 's cobweb . These needles have no eyes . " Shalom Pintchever 's face began to grow a kind of mold . His brows became even shaggier . Under his eyes there were bags and from them hung other bags . Between his wrinkles there was a black excrescence which no water could remove . His head shook from side to side . Nevertheless , when a guest arrived , Shalom would reach for his hotel register with a trembling hand and ask , " With or without ? " And the guest would almost invariably reply , " With . " 2 It all happened quickly . First Shaindel lay down and breathed her last . It occurred on the first day of Rush Hashanah .

Shalom , confused by grief , forgot the text of the Kaddish and had to be prompted . Those who attended the funeral said that his legs were so shaky , he almost fell into the grave . After Shaindel 's death Shalom Pintchever became senile . He took money from the cashbox and did n't remember what he did with it . He became so deaf that even screaming into his ears did not help . The Feast of Tabernacles was followed by such a rain spell that even the oldest townspeople could not recall its like . The river overflowed . The wheel of the water mill had to be stopped . The roof of the inn sprang a leak . The guests who had rooms on the top floor came down in the middle of the night , complaining that water was pouring into their beds . Shalom lay helpless in his own bedroom . It was Yanda who apologized to the guests and made up beds for them downIsaac Bashevis Singer was barn in a rabbinical family in Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a journalist in 1985 .

She even climbed a ladder up to the roof and tried to plug the leaks . But the shingles crumbled as soon as she touched them . In the morning , the guests left without paying their bills . Early Saturday as Shalom Pintchever picked up his prayer shawl and was about to leave for the synagogue , he began to sway and fell down . " Yanda , I am finished , " he cried out . Yanda ran to get some brandy , but it was already too late . Shalom lay stretched out on the floor , dead . There was an uproar in the town . Shalom had left no children . Irreverent people , for whom the sacredness of the Sabbath had little meaning , began to search for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Hall made a list of his belongings and sealed the drawer in which he kept his money . Yanda had begun to weep the moment Shalom had fallen down and did not stop until after the funeral . She had worked in the inn for over twenty years , but was left with barely sixty zlotys . The authorities immediately ordered her to get out . Yanda packed her belongings in a sack , put on a pair of shoes , which she usually wore only to church , wrapped herself in a shawl , and walked the long way to the railroad station . There was nobody to say goodbye . At the station , she approached the ticket window and said , " Kind sir , please give me a ticket to Skibica . " " There is no such station . " Yanda began to wail , " What am I to do , I am a. forsaken orphan ! " The peasants at the station jeered at her . The women spat on her . A Jewish traveling salesman began to question her about Skibica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In what county , or district is it ? At first Yanda remembered nothing . But the Jew in his torn coat and sheepskin hat persisted until Yanda finally remembered that the village was somewhere near Kielce , between Checzyn and Sobkow . The salesman told Yanda to take out the bank notes that she kept wrapped in a handkerchief and helped her to count the money . He talked it over with the ticket seller . There was no direct train to that area . The best way to go was by horse and buggy to Rozwadow , and from there on to Sandomierz , then to Opola , where she could either get a ride in another cart or go on foot to Skibica . Just hearing the names of these familiar places made Yanda weep . In Skibica , she had once had a father , a mother , a sister , relatives . Her mother had died and her father , not long before he died , had married another woman . Yanda had been about to become engaged to Wojciech , a peasant boy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken him away . During the yearsa story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 45 Yanda had worked for Shalom Pintchever she had seldom thought of the past . It all seemed so far away , at the end of the earth . But now that her employer was dead , there was nothing left for her but to return home . Who knew , perhaps some of her close ones were still alive . Perhaps somebody there still remembered her name . Thank God , good people helped . No sooner had Yanda left the town where she had lived in shame , than they stopped laughing at her , making grimaces , spitting . The coachmen did not overcharge her . Jews with beards and sidelocks seemed to know the whole of Poland as well as they knew the palms of their hands . They mentioned names of places which Yanda had already forgotten , and looked for shortcuts . In one tavern , someone took out a map to find the shortest way home for her . Yanda marveled at the cleverness of men ; how much knowledge they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help a homeless woman . But despite all the good advice , Yanda walked more than she rode . Rains soaked her , there was snow and hail . She waded through ditches of water as deep as streams . She had grown accustomed to sleeping on pillows with clean pillowcases , between white sheets , under a warm eiderdown , but now she was forced to stretch out on the floors of granaries and barns . Her clothes were wet through . Somehow she managed to keep her paper money dry . As Yanda walked she thought about her life . Once in a while Shalom Pintchever had given her money but it had dwindled away . The Russians had counted in rubles and kopecks . When the Austrians came the ruble lost its value , and everything was exchanged for kronen and hellers . The Bolsheviks used chervontzi ; the Poles , zlotys . How was someone like Yanda , uneducated as she was , to keep track of such changes ? It was a miracle that she had anything left with which to get home . God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept , peasants came to her and had their way with her . In a wagon , at night , somebody seized her silently . What do they see in me ? Yanda asked herself . It 's my bad luck . Yanda remembered that she had never been able to refuse anyone . Her father had beaten her for her submissiveness . Her stepmother had torn Yanda 's hair . Even as a child when she played with the other children , they had smeared her face with mud , given her a broom and made her take the part of Baba-Yaga . With the guests in Shalom 's hotel , she had had such savage and foolish experiences that she sometimes had n't known whether to laugh or cry . But to say no was not in her 46 YANDA nature . When she was young , while still in her father 's village , she had twice given birth to babies , but they had both died . Several times heavy work had caused her to miscarry . She could never really forget Wojciech , the peasant boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last moment had thrown her over . Yanda also had desired Shalom Pintchever , perhaps because he had always sent her to others and had never taken her himself . He would say , " Yanda , go to number three  --  Yanda , knock at the door of number seven . " He himself had remained faithful to his old wife , Shaindel . Perhaps he had been dis-gusted by Yanda , but she had yearned for him . One kind word from him pleased her more than all the wild games of the others . Even when he scolded her , she waited for more . As for the guests , there were so many of them , that Yanda had forgotten all but a few who stuck in her memory . One Russian had demanded that Yanda spit on him , tear at his beard , and call him ugly names . Another , a schoolboy with red cheeks , had kissed her and called her mother . He had slept on her breast until dawn , although guests in other rooms had been waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She did not know herself  --  certainly in her forties , or perhaps fifty ? Other women her age were grandmothers but she was returning to her village , alone , abandoned by God and man . Yanda made a resolution : once home , she would allow no man to approach her . In a village , there was always gossip and it usually ended in a quarrel . What did she need itfor ? The truth was that all this whoring had never given her any pleasure . 3 The Jews who showed Yanda the way had not fooled her . She reached Skibica in the morning , and even though it had changed considerably , she recognized her home . In a chapel at the outskirts of the village God 's mother still stood with a halo around her head and the Christ child in her arms . The figure had become dingy with the years and a piece of the Holy Mother 's shoulder was chipped off . A wreath of wilted flowers hung around her neck . Yanda 's eyes ' filled with tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into the village , and a smell she had long forgotten came to her nostrils : an odor of soggy potatoes , burned feathers , earth , and something else that had no name , but that her nose recognized . The huts were half-sunk into the ground , with tiny windows and low doors . The thatched roofs were mossy and rotting . Crows were cawing ; smoke rose from the chimneys . Yanda looked for the but where her parents had lived but it had disappeared and in its place was a smithy . She put down the sack she was carrying on her back . Dogs sniffed at her arid barked . Women emerged from the dwellings . The younger ones did not know her , but the old ones clapped their hands and pinched their cheeks , calling , " Oh , Father , Mother , Jesu Maria . " " Yes , it 's Yanda , as I love God . " Men , too , came to look at her , some from behind the stoves where they had been sleeping , others from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut . She gave her a piece of black bread and a cup of milk . On the dirt floor stood bins filled with potatoes , beets , black radishes , and cranberries . Chickens were cackling in a coop . The oven had a built-in kettle for hot water . At a spinning wheel sat an old woman with a balding head from which hung tufts of hair as white as flax . Someone screamed into her ear : " Grandma , this is Yanda . Pawel Kuril:ma 's daughter . " The old woman crossed herself . " Jesu Maria . " The peasant women all spoke together . Pawel Kuchma 's home had burned down . Yanda 's brother , Bolek , had gone to war and never returned . Her sister , Stasia , had married a man from Biczew and died there in childbirth . They also told Yanda what had happened to Wojciech , her former bridegroom-to-be . He had married Zocha and she had borne him fourteen children . Nine of them were still alive , but their mother had died of typhoid fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years . Zocha had worked for others to support the family . After her death three years before , he had become a complete derelict . Everything went for drink and he was half crazy . His boys ran around , wild . The girls washed clothes for the Jews of the town . His but was practically in ruins . As the women spoke to Yanda somebody opened the door and pushed a tall man inside . He was as lean as a stick , barefoot , with holes in his pants . He wore an open jacket without a shirt , his hair was long and disheveled  --  a living scarecrow . He did not walk , but staggered along as though on stilts . He had mad eyes , a dripping nose , and his crooked mouth showed one long tooth . Somebody said , " Wojciech , do you recognize this woman ? " " Pockmarked Yanda . " There was laughter and clapping . For the first time in years Yanda blushed , " See how you look . " " I heard you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't listen to him , Yanda , he 's drunk . " " What am I drunk on ? Nobody gives me a drop of vodka . " Yanda gaped at him . Could this be Wojciech ? Some similarity remained . She wanted to cry . She remembered an expression of Shaindel 's , " There are some in their graves who look better than he does . " Yanda regretted that she had come back to Skibica . A woman said , " Why do n't you have a look at his children ? " Yanda immediately lifted up her sack . She offered to pay for the bread and milk but the peasant woman rebuked her , " This is not the city . Here , you do n't pay for a piece of bread . " Wojciech 's but stood nearby . The roof almost touched the ground . Ell-locks of straw hung from its edges , The windows had no panes . They were stuffed with rags or boarded up . One entered it like a cave . The floor had rotted away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the semidarkness Yanda saw boys , girls . The place stank of dirty linen , rot , and something rancid . Yanda clutched her nose . Two girls stood at the tub , Half-naked children , smeared with mud , crawled on the floor . One child was pulling the tail of a kitten . A boy with a blind eye was mending a trap . Yanda blinked . She was no longer accustomed to such squalor . At the inn , the sheets had been changed each week . Every third day the guests got fresh towels . The leftover food had been enough to feed a whole family . Well , dirt has to be removed . It wo n't disappear by itself . Yanda rolled up her sleeves . She still had a few a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 47 zlotys and she sent one of the girls to buy food . A Jew had a store in the village where one could get bagels , herring , chickory . God in heaven , how the children devoured those stale bagels ! Yanda began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . At first the girls ignored her . Then they told her not to meddle in their affairs . But Yanda said , " I will take nothing from you . Your mother , peace be with her , was my friend . " Yanda worked until evening . She heated water and washed the children . She sent an older child to buy soap , a fine comb , and kerosene which kills lice . Every few minutes she poured out the slops . Neighbors came to look and shook their heads . They all said the same thing , Yanda 's work was in vain . The vermin could not be removed from that hut . In the evening , there was no lamp to light and Yanda bought a small kerosene lamp . The whole family slept on one wooden platform , and there were few blankets . Yanda covered the children with her own clothes . Late in the evening , the door opened and Wojciech intruded a leg . The girls began to giggle . Stefan , the boy with the blind eye , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here he comes  --  the skunk . " " You must not talk like that about your father . " Stefan replied with a village proverb , " When your father is a dog , you say git ' to him . " Yanda had saved a bagel and a piece of herring for Wojciech , but he was too drunk to eat . He fell down like a log , muttering and drooling . The girls stepped over him . Stefan mentioned that there was a straw mat in the shed behind the but that Yanda could use to sleep on . He offered to show her where it was . As soon as she opened the door of the shed , the boy pushed her and she fell . He threw himself on her . She tried to tell him that it was a sin , but he stopped her mouth with his hand . She struggled but he beat her with a heavy fist . She lay in the dark on wood-shavings , garbage . rotting rope , and the boy satisfied himself . Yanda closed her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out loud , she muttered , " Woe is me , I might have been your mother . " Harper 's Magazine , May 1968
