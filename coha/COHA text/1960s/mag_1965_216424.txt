Is Charlie Brown 's " good grief ! " an exclamation of fundamental Angst ? Does Linus ' blanket have a deep symbolic meaning ? Such questions may sound like ways to take the fun out of Charles Schulz 's famous comic strip Peanuts . But Robert L. Short , 32 , a graduate student at the University of Chicago Divinity School , argues not only amusingly but also convincingly that Peanuts indeed has intentional theological significance . <P> The Nameless Woe . In a new paperback called The Gospel According to Peanuts ( Knox ; $1.50 ) , Short contends that the cartoon , whose creator is a lay preacher in the Church of God of Anderson , Ind. , is a modern variety of prophetic literature , full of useful parables for the times . For example , " the doctrine of original sin is a theme constantly being dramatized in Peanuts . " When Charlie Brown gloomily confides to Linus that he has " been confused right from the day I was born , " he sums up the " nameless woe " that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of man 's sinfulness is the inability of Schulz 's characters to change for the better : fuss-budgety Lucy is destined to grow from " the crabby little girl of today " to " the crabby old woman of tomorrow " ; " good ol ' wishy-washy " Charlie Brown will be forever friendless , always the losing pitcher in 184-to-O baseball games . Trapped by what Cardinal Newman called " some terrible aboriginal calamity , " Schulz 's characters never seem able to keep up with the world . As Linus puts it : " How can you do ' new math ' problems with an ' old math ' mind ? " <P> <P> Sin , according to St. Paul , is worshiping any god but God . In Schulz 's " child 's garden of reverses , " says Short , false idols are plentiful , and the wages of sin are paid in terms of an " emotional clobbering . " Thus Linus ' beloved blanket- " only one yard of outing flannel stands between me and a nervous breakdown " - is constantly threatened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits ( and drinks 32 cups of coffee a day ) . Lucy 's love for Schroeder goes unrequited ; the heart of the little blond pianist belongs only to Beethoven . Charlie Brown 's lowpowered positive thinking- " I actually believe that I can fly this kite " - always ends in a tangle of string . <P> Ups , Not Downs . Like the adults they really are , the children of Peanuts are beset by an assortment of griefs and fears . Charlie Brown 's little sister Sally is afraid of kindergarten . Linus , refusing to memorize his piece for the Christmas pageant , knuckles under when faced with the imminent threat of his sister 's cocked fist . The ungovernable loudmouth Lucy gets depressed by the thought that the world has downs as well as ups . " I do n't want any downs , ' " she bellows . " I just want ' ups ' and ' ups ' and ' ups . ' " Even Snoopy-whom Short sees as a kind of Christ figure , a hound of heaven alternately threatening to run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail-wagging friendship-is obsessed with a " weed-claustrophobia " that makes him a less than desirable outfielder , a fallible catcher in the rye .
