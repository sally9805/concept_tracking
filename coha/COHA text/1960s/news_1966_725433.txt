txt The nation 's growing manpower shortage is about to produce a new food blender for Mrs. William A. Volz of San Jose , Calif . The connection is simple , Mrs. Volz 's 30-year-old husband is a senior engineer at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation 's Marine Division al nearby Sunnyvale . The corn . pang awarded him the food blender the other day for persuading his father-in-law to join the company as a turret lathe operator , a critically needed skill . The use of a food blender to lure a worker into a new job may sound a bit unusual , but a0 New York Times survey of scores of employers in 20 major labor markets this week turned up evidence that such inducements are being used with increasing frequency these days as companies scramble to find qualified people for vacant jobs . These tactics are being prompted by a tightening labor supply across the nation . President Is Concerned Federal experts assert there still is not a general manpower shortage . The survey tends to confirm this . However , talks with employers show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow worse as unemployment slips below last month 's 3.7 per cent of the civilian labor force . The tightening manpower situation ham already become a major concern of President Johnson . He called earlier this month for labor and management to join Federal agencies in seeking " bold new approaches " to head off a general shortage . The Administration is worried because manpower shortages can promote inflation . They can force employers to bid against each other for the same workers , or to hire less productive workers , either of which pushes up labor costs . Shortages can also create bottlenecks that limit production , encouraging companies to raise prices because they are enjoying strong demand . The Times survey confirmed the Administration 's contention that the manpower supply was tightest in the major industrial cities around the Great Lakes and concentrated in certain skills . The survey turned up only slight evidence that personnel shortages were causing production bottlenecks so far . But it uncovered a relatively large amount of bidding by employers for the same workers . " We are facing both a regional and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles B. Dates , manager of employe and community relations for the General Electric Company 's Re-Entry Systems Department in Philadelphia . " We have been unable to find the number of qualified engineers , scientists , technicians and skilled trades people in the Delaware Valley area as quickly as we need them , " Mr. Dates explains . " Our placement specialists fan out across the country almost every week ? from Boston to Miami to Seattle , Los Angeles . Unfortunately , there are shortages in most of these areas also . " . Tobs for the Asking A similar lament is heard from employers in most parts of the United States , particularly those seeking engineers , technicians , machinists and metalworkers . The Douglas Aircraft Company has dispatched three vice presidents to a Los Angeles radio station to make a pitch for engineers . A. Chicago employment agency reports shortages of lathe operators and electrical assemblers . " It used to be that a stenographer sent out with the prospect of a job would be told , ' We 'll let you know in a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency fee , " comments Frank Rogers of Manpower , Inc. , a temporary-help agency , in Boston . " Now , the company offers to pay the fee , the stenographer says , ' I 'll let you know in a day or two . ' " The shortages are not limited to skilled workers . " This summer we are going to have some difficulty filling low-paid common labor jobs , " says a Denver employment service official . A Pittsburgh area steel executive laments : " Most of our applicants are kids who have pumped gas or swung hamburgers . " The problem is particularly acute in such cities as Chicago and Milwaukee , where the jobless rate is about 2.5 per cent , which is considered full employment after normal job-changing is considered . " The only other time we had a situation like this was during World War II , " says Emil T. Molis , assistant manager of the Wisconsin State Employment Service in Ashland . Trouble in Production Most companies surveyed say ! the manpower shortages so fart have not hampered production , ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company re- ; ports its shipments would be ' 10 per cent higher if it had the ! manpower it needed . Firth ! Sterling . Inc. , a specialty steel ; company in , Pa. , ' says equipment it received two , months ago is sitting idle be- , cause it can not find personnel to put it into production . The shortage of workers is 6 leadinci to greater opportunities for many employes , and an increasing number of them seem to be showing more in- , dependence . The United States Department of Labor reported this month that the employe quit rate in January was 19 per 1,000 workers or the highest in more than 12 years . Employes " can select the shift they want , write their own ticket on things like this , " says a rubber company official . " They 'll leave now at the drop of a hat , " he continued and this is causing raising costs . An Atlanta laundry official says workers " Walk out at lunch or leave at night , and , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts by one company . to land him , says he told the recruiter : " Do n't bother me , buddy . I 've got too many job offers already . " In order to ease their shortages , companies are turning more to rewarding workers for landing needed employes . John F. Mallory , personnel supervisor at Westinghouse 's plant in Sunnyvale. says the food blender that Mrs. Volz will get is but one of about a dozen ' such awards granted since the new program started on March 8 . The Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company has drawn about 100 skilled mechanics by ' awarding $25 to employes who recruited them .

A spokesman for the Martin Company in Denver says the defense company is short of engineers and scientists . " We have to steal them from somebody else . " he observes . " Everybody in the field is pirating . " The competition for workers is pushing up some wage rates , which is precisely what Federal Dfficials fear will raise labor costs and encourage inflation . Nonunion workers in some Southern textile plants have received three wage increases in the last year ; for example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , in Chicago , reports the cost of unskilled labor has risen to $2.25 to $2.60 an hour from $2 an hour a year ago . Pay for maids has risen about $1 a day in the last year , says a Georgia Employment Service official in Atlanta . Government officials are seeking to avoid this type of inflation-inducing competition , and to extend jobs to the 3.2 million people still unemployed , by promoting job training programs . Federal manpower programs this year will reach about 250,000 workers , up from 225 , - 000 last year . Arthur M. Ross , the United States Commissioner of Labor Statistics , emphasizes that full employement has still not been reached even though there are growing manpower shortages . There still are 2.6 million workers seeking full-time jobs . and all but 200,000 of them have previous full-time experience , he reports . Standards Are Cited Mr. Ross and other Federal experts contend manpower resources are not exhausted because employment is still growing at a rate that is 250.000 above the seasonal rate every month . They say the real problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , and they are emphasizing training to cure the mismatch . " We 've extended our in-training programs and we 're cooperating with local and national educational and industrial institutions to try to allieviate this shortage , " says an official of the National Acme Company , a Cleveland machine tool company . Other companies report similar efforts , but some Federal officials contend most employers still do less than they should . Most manpower experts say many companies are having personnel problems because they are sticking to unnecessarily high job standards . " There are still a lot of employers who wo n't hire a man over 40 or 45 , or women . or young people , " says one Labor Department official . This official also says that some unions . particularly in construction , are too restrictive in apprenticeship requirements . " Why does a guy have to spend four years to be an electrician ? " he asks . President Johnson earlier this month prodded unions and management to ease such artificial barriers , and to redesign jobs so they could be done with less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jobs normally done by adult men could be done by women , teen-agers , the handicapped and immigrants . Some redesigning is underway . A California Employment Service official in Los Angeles says many employers " are relaxing criteria , such as waiving high-school diploma requirements and hiring women when they would n't have before .

A Chicago public aid official , for example . says that even janitors are required to be literate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can read or write can get a job in Detroit . " says one automobile company , spokesman . " But for his own ! safety , and ours , he has to be able to read signs such as ' To stop this machine push button . ' " Arthur M. Ross , Commissioner of Labor Statistics , said 2.6 - million workers seek jobs despite shortage of manpower in some areas .
