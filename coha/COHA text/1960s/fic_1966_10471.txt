Hall had no sooner left than in came mine supervisor Barney Davis , and he was followed by Vince Bonali , one of the facebosses on at Number Nine Thursday night near the blast in the southeast section . It was after noon before he got his breath and ate the doughnutAnnie had bought for him . From Hall , he picked up a small feature on the events that kept him home from the mine Thursday night and away from death . Spare stunted man in his early fifties , married but childless , with a long record of absenteeism in the mine , Hall explained that he had " had a hunch " about that night : it was on the eighth of the month , and one of his cousins had been hurt by a fall on the eighth of July some years back , and his bird dog had died the eighth of last December , just a month ago . " Now , I ai n't superstitious , Mr. Miller , I do n't hold no truck with black cats and suchlike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , them mines they is always dangerous in the winter , now I 'm fatalistic about it , I figger when the Good Lord He says my day is up , well , it 's up , but then in the summer they 's always these here falls . The roofs , why , they jis fall in . You kin usually hear them , they 's a kinder stretchin ' sound , a kinder crackle , oh , it ai n't near so bad in the winter . I do n't mind workin ' in the  --  but , see , in the winter then , everthing it gits all dried out and they 's a powerful lot of dust , and , you know , that dadblamed mine , they do n't lay enough rock dust , Mr. Miller , I 'm tellin ' you the Lord 's own truth , they do n't give a care about us miners , they do n't give a care about nothin ' except makin ' money . Why , the coal dust gits so bad you cai n't even see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , your lights right on them and all . And that 's how it is that it 's winter when all these here explosions takes place . I do n't mind it in the summer so terrible much . But , you know , I do n't think I 'm gon na work no more down in the mines . No , sir , I do n't think so . " Hall squirmed buglike in his chair , twisted his visored cap in his slender hands , pale mapped with blue veins . He refused the cigarette Miller offered him . " No , thanks , Mr. Miller . It 's right kind , but I do n't smoke none . No , listen , I got all this here coal dust down in my lungs , see , cause once you breathe it in , why , it do n't never come out again , and I 'm afeered that smokin ' might touch off a kinder explosion right there in my lungs and , you know , smokin ' causes TB and this here dust it sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor told me this , Mr. Miller , it 's the Lord 's truth , and the lung it gits as tough as the backside of an old mule , and you start coughin ' and ifnp101you smoke , you git TB . Oxford , he smoked all the dadblamed time , and I always says to him , I says , Oxford , dadblame it  --  Oxford , he 's my buddy , he was my buddy , he got killt down there , Oxford Clemens , they all called him Ferd , but I called him Oxford , oh , he were n't worth a hill a beans , he come from pretty poor stock , and that man he cussed and smoked all the time , but I ai n't one to use nicknames , see , I think it 's downright unfriendly , and , why , nobody called Jesus by no nickname , did they ? But Oxford , he did n't pay me no mind , he went right on smokin ' . He had a cough , too , I were n't surprised none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , it was agin the rules and all , but he never gave no care about no rules , when he wanted him a dadblamed smoke , he was gon na have it . Shoot , everbodyelse done the same , it were n't jis Oxford . But our faceboss , that 's Angelo Moroni , Mr. Miller , he got killt , too , well , he did n't like the idea none , and he always said , do n't lemme catch none a you guys smokin ' down here or I 'll have you outa here on your tail fast as scat , that 's more or less how he put it , but he never took the cigarettes away , so what happened is all these guys 'd duck off in some room where they 'd stopped working and sneak them a smoke now and agin , and , well , Mr. Miller , ifn they'da smoked out in the haulageways in the open , it wouldn'ta been dangerous at all , but these here abandoned rooms , they 's plumb fulla gas , and everbody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! I do n't want none a you guys to smoke at all and that 's period ! That 's pretty much how he put it . " " How many years have you been a miner , Mr. Hall ? " " Thirty-six years , Mr. Miller , thirty-six years , off and on . " The man had small eyes circled with worry lines , an overbite , very little chin . A light gray grizzle furred his cheeks . " Do you know Bruno well ? " " No , I seen a lot of him , he was on my shift and all , but , no , I cai n't say as how I really know him . Always I felt sorry on account of the others they all picked on him a lot down there , but you could n't never git friendly with him , he was a kinder inter-verted type , ifn you know what I mean . Like you 'd say it was a nice day , and he 'd jis stare back at you . He was a funny bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment as though listening , himself resembling for that instant a " funny bird , " and then he continued : " Knowed his buddy well . Was n't it a pity , Mr. Miller , how Ely Collins had to suffer ? Do n't seem right somehow , man like that , he was our preacher , you know , how his leg got chopped off and how . . . " Hall 's voice trailed awayp102as , gazing off , he suffered Collins ' mutilations . " He took a lotta trouble with Bruno , he was always tryin ' to save him , build him up . " " You mean he was trying to convert him from Catholicism ? " " Not exactly , on account of he were n't no Catholic , or leastways none a them other Roman fellers cared to claim him . They said he 'd split off or somethin ' and I guess he 's sort of nothin ' at all . " " Did Collins talk to you about leaving the mine ? " " Or seeing white birds in the workings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ely , musta been somebody else . " " And now you 're thinking of retiring , Mr. Hall ? " " Well , now , I wo n't exactly say that , Mr. Miller , but I 'm gon na be lookin ' around . I ai n't too old to learn a new trade . My wife Mabel she thinks I oughter start over in somethin ' where I kin work out in the open . I ai n't afeerd none a the mines , a miner he ai n't skeered about goin ' down , else he 'd never go , you git fatalistic , but it 's jis they 's so dadblamed unhealthy . Besides , that there bed is playin ' out , and now they 's this mess down there to clean up  --  you know , they do n't give no care at all about the poor miner what gits throwed outa his job , they jis only reckon up what it 's gon na cost them to fix up all the damage , and they reckon up how much they kin make off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtract , and it all depends on the number they end up with , see , no , it 's the Lord 's own truth , Mr. Miller . It do n't come to their minds none about us poor miners , outa work and too dadblamed old to start over again . Why , I do n't know what I 'd do now , see , I 'm over fifty , and you cai n't learn an old dog , as the feller says , why , they 're jis leavin ' us to rot ! " " That pansy ! " Davis grinned later , when Miller described the interview . " Why sometimes right in the middle of a shift , he 'd start bellyachingabout the smoke and cry around there was going to be an accident and he 'd refuse to work . He has n't got the nerve for the job . " " Maybe , " said Miller , " but , still , there he was , right afterwards , volunteering for rescue crews and taking twice the risk of usual work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , Barney , before I forget . I saved you a couple extra copies of the special . Your ugly mug made it again . " " What the hell ! Two nights running ! I 'm getting famous ! " Davis opened the paper , searched out his photograph , studied it a moment , then tossed it down on the desk with an effort at indifference , hand/some square jaw set in disdain . " Think you 'll win some more prizes with it ? " " Maybe . If your picture does n't stop them . " Barney laughed and Miller asked , " What caused it , Barney ? Have you figured it out ? " " Smoking , Tiger . I 'd bet my last buck on it . We located two or three possible areas where it might have been touched off . Trouble is , the first blast set off secondary ones , so you ca n't always be sure which is the first one . But we 're pretty convinced one of those guys or more was smoking . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , " said Davis with a loose laugh , touching the bridge of his rimless glasses , " you do n't figure the union 's gon na volunteer that , do you ? Anyhow , we already found some cigarettes . " " Whose were they ? " " I do n't want you to print any of this now , Miller , it would only prejudice the inspections , but we found them next to a new kid , his first night down there , kid named Tony Rosselli , by him and a timberman , Oxford Clemens . " Clemens was out of Miller 's own generation , and his violent death , like a breath of his own approaching doom , had preyed on Miller more than any of the other ninety-six . Ox had been his adolescent effort at rehabilitation of the downtrodden , and though Clemens as hero had disconcerted him , the emotions and indistinct yearnings of that sophomoric time had their claws in him yet . " We did n't find any matches , but they may have got blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why was there so much fire , Barney ? " " You 're getting at we did n't have enough rock dust down , " Davis said defensively , adjusting again the glasses on his small sharp nose . " I know , that 's what the union propaganda 's trying to establish . Sure , it could have been better , it always could have been better , it 's one of those things you can never do enough . But we passed all the inspections , Miller , and we 'd just ordered some more , figured to lay it down in February , but , well , it just did n't work out the best possible way  --  we did n't want those guys to die , Miller . " " No , I know , Barney , but  --  " " I wish to hell we had had more rock dust down , I can tell you that , I 'm goddamn sorry how it has turned out . But that 's a small thing , you do n't need any rock dust at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Why , we hold safety meetings every month , and do you think it does one goddamn bit of good ? Those bastards go rightp104on smoking  --  what can you do ?  --  and not taking care of their machinery , just asking for trouble . Sometimes , it 's just like they 're daring the goddamn mines to fall on their heads and half hoping it will , like that 's gon na prove something or something . " Miller asked the question he supposed he 'd be asking for weeks to come : " What about it , Barney : think you 'll reopen ? " " Ca n't say yet , Miller . I hope so . It 's my job , too , after all . After the official inspections , we 'll survey the mine , consider its potential , and if there 's any goddamn chance at all it can be profitably reopened , why , we 'll do it . There 's too many people around here depend on that mine , Miller , and we do n't want to let them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pigs either . If you 're gon na print anything , I 'd suggest you say that at this time the company has no intention of closing the mine . I think you can say that . " Davis got up to go . " And , say , I just want to mention , we did n't think too much of that story by Chigi . He was just one guy of hundreds out there working their asses off and it seemed like his story made it out he went down there single-handed and carried Bruno out on his goddamn back . " " Really ? I thought it was pretty fair , Barney  --  " " Well , I 'm exaggerating . But I just wanted you to know  --  and it did n't exactly paint the mine as the prettiest place in the country to work , either , if you know what I mean . " " Well , " Miller laughed , " it is n't . " They stood , and while they were shaking hands , Vince Bonali walked in . Greetings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . " You got a real parade today , Miller , " Davis said . " Hell , you ca n't hog it all , " Bonali said . Davis laughed unconvincingly and , with good-byes , left . Miller took down Bonali 's account of the night of the disaster . Bonali was faceboss over eighteen men in twelfth west off old Main South , not too distant from where Bruno and the other six had entombedthemselves up in fourteenth east ; he had been in the zone of impact and only yards out of the sections where the fire had reached . With the habit of all facebosses Miller had ever known , he provided an extensive preamble on his own merits as a miner , punctuatingwith stabs of his mutilated cigar . As he talked he grew excited , nearly shouting . No longer looking at Miller , he seemed to be concentrating on some point about five or six feet out in front of him . Big barrel-chested guy with a voice that filled the office . Impressivep105man . Probably a good faceboss , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so thick you ca n't see . I find out there 's four guys have bugged out . Two of them , Lucci and Brevnik , they got out okay , though I gave them a royal chewing afterwards for jumping the goddamn gun . The other two who left was Cravens and Minicucci . They must have gone the wrong way . " He paused to consider them , then went on to describe enthusiastically exactly how they had used the ninth east air course , crossed over on the overcast to the New Main South air course , running into Abner Baxter 's section , and exited the mine about two and a half hours after the explosion . " What kind of guy is Baxter , by the way ? " Miller asked . " I called him for a routine interview and he flapped into a rage on the wealth of the wicked and the sanctity of the poor , but refused to come down for an interview and would n't let me quote him . " Bonali hesitated , bit down on his cigar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's been a pain in my ass since the day I was born . Nothing was ever enough for him . He and his buddies nearly wrecked the union movement through these parts . Every time we organized , he 'd disorganize , and then holler at us for lack of guts . Stirred up a lot of bad feeling toward . . . toward our people , too . For awhile , it was like one union for Italians , one for Americans . And he made a lot of noise but he was scared of fighting himself and he always packed a gun . Guys got killed in those days , and it was n't only the scabs . Of course , I do n't need to tell you that , Tiger . Your Dad was a great guy . A buddy of mine got it , right in the brains , one of the toughest union men we ever had , and just about everybody knows it was Baxter shot him , but there was no way of proving it . Back then , we blamed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we was afraid of busting up our own ranks , but everybody knew . Now he 's grown him a fat belly and has got religion and lets his steam off on the holy rollers . We brought our sections out together Thursday night , and this is just between you and me , but he wanted to drag Davis out of his office and lynch him . He 's a nut . " Miller asked him what he thought caused the blast . " Gas , Tiger . Only thing that can cause one like that . Damn mine is full of it . " Bonali squashed his cigar murderously into an ashtray , thick dark brows crossed into an angry frown . " Needed better control , better ventilation . All those abandoned workings up in fifteenth and sixteenth were full of caves , pumping out methane by the tankfuls . Should have either ventilated better in there , or closed it off.  |p106S|park  off some motor , maybe even just the goddamn friction of one piece of machinery rubbing up against some other one  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firetrap , Tiger . It 's a wonder we did n't all of us get killed . " " Barney said they 'd passed all inspections . " " I do n't give a shit what Barney Davis says , there was n't any goddamn dusting done . Listen , sometimes those inspectors do n't even trouble their asses to come down into the mine . They just have them a big fancy dinner somewhere and lots of drinks with Davis and the rest of those bastards , and the next day they vale their report , hell , I 've seen it ! " " Pretty serious charges , Vince . " " Yeah , and there 's ninety-seven dead buddies of mine to make then more serious , Tiger , including one of the greatest facebosses that mine ever saw . " A tear came to that strong man 's eye , and he brushed it away . " But , hell , do n't quote me , I 'd never get another job in this country . " " Say , somebody said something about some horseplay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bruno . " Bonali flushed . " Well , there was n't nothing , it was  --  no , there was n't any horseplay . " Miller laughed . " Hell , I 'm not running court , Vince . What I want to find out is about that poem . " " Oh , that . " Bonali grinned , shifted heavily in his chair . He rubbed his jaw with his hand , the little finger of which was missing . " Yeah . Bruno wrote a poem . " " Do you still have it ? " " The poem ? Naw , I gave it back to him . What would I want with the goddamn thing ? Poem about his Mother . " Bonali laughed loosely . " That silly bastard ! " Rosalia brings Mama . The veil she wears to funerals she is wearing and her feet are compressed into the old black shoes too small for her . Sia fatta la vostra volonta . Stands so darkly singular , small hurt blemish in this sterile white . Tears glinting like prisms tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My boy ! " she says to the nurses who enter . " My boy ! my Chonny ! " Her Mama , whom English frightens , is the only person to Marcella 's knowledge who has called Giovanni by the English equivalent of his name . Mumbles , rootlike fingers rattling the rosary . Curved light ekes out of radiators , bending perception . Adesso e nell ' ora della nostra morte . Marcellap107repeats the words . Giovanni , the tall boy whose shy protective love has brought her safely to womanhood , lies suspended in a mechanism of light and steel , generated by his own indecisive pulse . " My boy ! povero Chonny ! " The old black shoes melt into the marble floor . Boots , really , with hooks instead of holes for the laces . Brittle and black and cracked . Reflecting the white room , condensing it into a minute pattern of glitter deep in the hard black polish . Nonna 's shoes . Cosi sia . Her Mama thinks Giovanni is already dead . Shaved and lightly barbered , the Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to bed , Miller drove to the hospital . Over the phone , Lewis had told him Bruno was still in a coma , no change in his condition , but that Miller could speak this afternoon with the man 's sister if he wished . Bright cold day  --  prinked faintly with a widely scattered dazzle of frost crystals  --  chiseled the town 's usual tumble of casual boxes into planes of rare precision . He drove through these hard streets feeling himself peculiarlydistinct , as though watching the processes of animation that slid him , white outlined cartoon figure , past the fixed drop of white outlined cartoon town . The speedgraphic lay , as always , on the seat beside him , but it was unlikely he would use it . Formulated questions , but images of her fragmented them . He was surprised to discover that his hands were sweating on the wheel . The hospital , usually a dead white inside , was today somehow blurred and hopeful , a contrast to the frozen clarity he had just driven through . Uncommonly , neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind this afternoon as he entered , but rather a flush of pleasure in visible human progress warmed him . We move on . Things can be better . There are goals . This bud of wellbeing was threatened momentarily by a nearencounterwith Wesley Edwards , the Presbyterian minister , out dispensinghis crinkly-smile consolations , but luckily Edwards did n't see him , turned into somebody 's room . Actually , the man Edwards , while unimaginative and soft-souled , was no worse than the rest of the West Condoners  --  no , what rankled was his goddamn presumption . All his breed galled Miller , but especially the complacently doubtful types like Edwards  --  he blanked out this town 's small mind with his codified hand-me-down messages , and when you pushed him he would slyly hint he did n't believe it himself , goddamn ethical parable or some crap of the sort . Well , you 're still the old fundamentalistat heart , Miller accused himself . Miller had noticed that Ed/wards , awkward among ailing men , spent most of his time giggling with the hospitalized women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so was he . Maybe the bastard got a buzz out of their bedpans . The thought made Miller smile , and it was this smile he carried into the third-floor convalescent lounge , where Marcella Bruno awaited him . He arrives , in crushed light , bringing with him the air of old storybooks , things wanted , things with a buried value in them . As a child , she watched him run , a man to her , though they called him a boy , a man with long legs and strong shoulders . He ran for them and was praised , he leapt and was loved . And now it is for her he comes smiling , a man to her still , long and strong , with something about him of forest greenness and church masonry and northern stars . They speak of her brother , of her family , he asks about her . A man to be praised , yes , a man to be loved . Back in , the cartoon town had fuzzed once more into lumpy solids , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sore , worn , he had found a young girl 's affection and had plunged in wholly . Where would it end ? He did n't care , he would see her again . The lumps glided recognizably by , and he found he hated them less . " You arrogant shit ! " he said out loud , and laughed . Still high , he left the Chevy in the plant lot and went straight to Mick 's . Had n't had anything but Cokes and a doughnut . He found Lou Jones at the big round table near the bar , apparerilly into some story , and he thought of some Jones could be telling that put him ill at ease . With Jones were the hotelman Wally Fisher , the lawyer Ralph Himebaugh , and Maury Castle , who had a shoestore in town , three of Mick 's most dependable klatchers . Although Fisher had a coffeeshop and bar in his own hotel , he was always in here afternoons . " Two with onions , Mick , and a beer , " Miller said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Jones , disgruntled at having his story interrupted , leaned back and lit a cigar . The others cheered , reluctantly but sincerely , yesterday 's special edition , and exulted once more in the Father Jones escapade . Castle rattled tonight 's paper and read Miller 's " inexplicable lapse " box aloud for laughs , then Wally Fisher rumbled , " So , come on , Father , tell us what the sonuvabitch did . " " Lou was just describing one of the gentlemen at your newspaper , "  |p109Himebaugh  said by way of explanation . His quaint precision tinkled discordantly in the dark plain bar . " He has a rather , shall we say , individual manner of demonstrating his passions . " Castle heehawed . " Who 's that ? " asked Miller . " Carl , " said Jones . The pressman . Miller grinned . " I should have guessed . Schwartz is the world 's most disturbed cocksman . What now ? " Mick passed a glass of beer over the counter and Castle slid it across the formica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the place was quiet . Only the sizzle of hamburgers in the yard-square kitchen off the bar . Mick had the television on as always , but the volume was off . Grand gestures of a bigmouthed guy pushing deodorant . Jones drank off his beer , nodded at Mick for another . " Says he was worldweary after his unusual Sunday labors yesterday , so to restore the spirit he toted body and soul over to Waterton to Mrs. Dooley 's . He meets with this  --  " " Mrs. Dobie 's , " interrupted Miller . " You can see how often Jones gets over there ! " Jones did n't share in the laughter , chose to relight his cigar instead . His eyelids slowly drooped the table to silence . " He meets with this pigeon he has in the past plucked , and he flaps over to bicker with her the tariff . But this birdie is grounded . Very down in the beak . Just slopping up a drink or two , she says . Carl inquires what can the matter be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine accident . " Miller glanced up , winced inwardly . That bitter breath again . Had to be her . " She has decided she is gon na take a week off from the ranch , fly the scene , try to forget . She 's sniffling blowsily , and Carl is afraid she 's gon na break into some noisy lament and ruin his whole fucking night . He scans the club , but the others are all paired , have eggs aplenty . " " You would think they would do less business on such a night , " Himebaugh interposed softly , but they ignored him . " So finally he says to her , let 's go to your room , have a quiet drink there , you can tell me all about it , I 'll buy the bottle . She 's a sorrylookingred-eyed droop , but , as I say , he has no choice . She shrugs and says okay . She leads the way , and at this juncture in the narration , Carl consecrates a quarter hour or so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs a few inches in front of his face , her skirt rucking and rippling , and bringing on , in Carl , a certain agitated enlargement . "  |p110While  Castle hollered about that , Miller asked , " Hey , Mick , what about those hamburgers ? " " Hunh ? Oh , Jesus , Tiger ! Hold on ! " Mick ran to the kitchen , called out , " Just in time ! " Which meant they were black , not white , ash . " Round of beers , too , Mick . " The bigmouth guy on television , who had earlier been urging fragrant armpits , now spun a large wheel , while a muss of little mousy women stood by mockbreathless , clutching their handbags . Whole goddamn American populace was becoming a bunch of actors . Mick handed the hamburgers , fresh from cremation , over the bar to Castle and went to work on the beers . Jones puffed on the cigar , took a long swallow of beer , continued : " So they get to the room . He , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tumblers . There 's only one chair in the room , and , just his luck , while he 's dispensing whiskey , she 's planting her buns on it . Carl seeks a scheme to decoy her off the chair and onto the bed . He puts her drink on the dresser , thinking she 'll come and get it . No . She sits there looking run-over and commences to stare at her feet . He suggests she go lie down , as she looks a mite peaked . She hears nothing . He finally concludes he will have to use force , and that is just the which he does not care yet to do . " Jones drinks to the rapt silence . Mick hung over the bar with a big foolish grin on his broad Italian face , finally came around and joined the others at the table . " What do you mean ? " he asked incredulously , without dropping the grin . " You mean he aims to lay this miserable broad ? " Mick was a large guy , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he 's thinking about this and he is just about to screw the gentility act and go heave her off , when the godefamn whore herself gets blithely up and humps off to weewee . Carl hastily claps her whiskey down on the night table aside the famous scene of action and appropriates the chair for himself . And , true to form , she staggers back in , still out of the plot , and plumps down on the bed . She picks up the glass , drinks it off like it was water , sets it down again . Still , she has n't looked once at our hero , has n't let a peep . " Himebaugh was giggling softly , eyes squinting slightly under his bushy black eyebrows . There was a prudery in him that usually drove him from such gatherings as this  --  he was a common visitor to this table , but seldom stayed long . Now he tittered and stared at his hands , nervous on the tabletop . Fisher , a flabby old man , sat leaning back on two legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofp111his neck , a smile on his poker face  --  he frankly enjoyed the story , rarely interpolated . Castle guffawed abruptly from time to time , but not in strict cadence with the tale . He had round leathery cheeks that ballooned when he laughed . Castle could tell at a glance where a man bought his shoes , and , if they were n't from his place , it did n't pacify him to explain you had to spread your business around . " Meanwhile , our man in Waterton is taking it easy with the alcohol . He pumps in a couple stiff swallows , avers it prolongs the action , but too much and he might not fire off at all  --  " " Yes , that 's true ! " Mick sang , then flushed when everyone roared . Fisher even had to ease his chair down on all four legs momentarily for fear his convulsions would spill him . Jones smiled around his dead cigar , continued : " Patience pays its way . The whore spreads on the bed and commences to chatter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She kicks off her shoes . Carl , coolly denying still his throbbing rod , pumps her more about the brother . She tells all . Tears . Very touchingscene . Carl waxes sympathetic . It is very sad indeed . He even works up a kind of tear and rubs his eye red . Advises her she ought to turn in for the night , forget all about it , head off tomorrow on that trip she 's been thinking about . She 's grateful . Says by Jesus he understands her . She tells him nighty-night and flops over to the wardrobe , stopping by the dresser to puddle out another tumblerful . Sets the tumbler on the floor by the wardrobe , hauls off her blouse , skirt , and bra , drops her drawers , wriggles into a traditional scrap of lingerie . " Jones paused to light the cigar again , while the others exchanged commentary . Lou could never keep a cigar going and tell a story at the same time . Miller had finished the hamburgers , delicious in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched over the table in such unabashed absorption , he did n't have the heart to break the spell . Fisher smoked and chuckled drily , leaning back . Castle brayed and shouted , " Come on ! " and beat the table . Himebaugh giggled to himself and stared at his glass , still full of beer . " She squats for the tumbler and is surprised to discover our boy still in the picture . Look , she says , I 'm going to bed . Like you said . Good night . Thanks , but good night . Carl shrugs , tells her do n't mind him , he 's just finishing his drink , and before she can object he switches back to the beloved brother , jaws on like he has known the poor bastard all his life . So she does n't complain now , just quaffs the rye , then nests into the sheets , her famous bun to the breezes , and listensp112to him . Carl says she holds her goddamn hand curled up against her mouth and reminds him of how his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A detail only a doting father could provide , " Miller interposed . Fisher laughed drily , but the others seemed not to have noticed there had been an interruption . Jones downed his beer . Himebaugh 's glass sat untouched in front of him . The man 's soft flabby titter was nearly inaudible . Seemed in some world of his own . On the screen above , pain pills were Bigmouth 's product now . Disturbingly graphic . Jones said , " Carl 's knob , caught wrong in his pants somehow , is paining him , so he decides the time is come . She is gazing placidly and weepily through the far wall , so he quietly slips his pants off and , talking all the time , hooks them on the foot of her bed . Then , just as the whore seems about to emerge from her distant focus , he jumps her , pins her arms behind her , and says : Your brother was the biggest shit I ever knew , he deserved to die ! " " Jesus Christ ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . Mick was stunned , jaw slack , and even old Fisher lowered his chair , smile sliding to frown . " Mad ! " whispered Himebaugh , glancing at the others . " The man is a psychopath , a lust murderer ! " But , strangely , it was as though he were still giggling . " That cocksucker ! " Castle thundered , as always the most vocal . " Why , he 's a damn , a damn , a goddamn  --  what did you say , Hirnebaugh ? " With that , they started to laugh again . While Jones relit his cigar a fourth time , Miller ducked behind the bar and pulled five more beers , omitting Ralph . Castle , Fisher , DeMars , and Himebaugh stared at each other with astonished half grins and exchanged condemnations . " No , what I mean , that sonuvabitchoughta hang ! " Mick declared in summation . " Well , the hapless lady is too shocked even to fart , " Jones resumed . " She starts a fierce struggle to break loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's at a real disadvantage there on her belly with two hundred and fifty pounds of hot raging beef saddling her , pinning her wings . And all the time he keeps rubbing it in what a cheap rotten punk her goddamn brother was . " Castle banged . Fisher was over the table . " Only trouble is , Carl complains , he ca n't get his reamer in the slot from behind , nice inspirational view of these great hates butting and flushing , but from the style he has her pinned , he ca n't jack her up enough to bore in without losing his hold . He triesp113to tap the devil 's porthole , but there 's too much angry muscle there . " Himebaugh , wide-eyed , watched it in his beer glass . Mick gaped . On the screen , Bigmouth was panned offcamera and a sniveling grandmotheradmired her new prizes . " Carl clamps both her wrists in one hand , perforates and diddles her with the thumb of the other . She screams and bawls and then suddenly she twists out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and claw , but Carl downs her finally and plunges it in and she shrieks like she 's been stabbed for the first time . Carl 's getting edgy about the cops or Mrs. Dopey , it 's a scene like that , figures you can hear her all the way to West Condon , but he has locked the door and the time it 'll take them to break it down he reckons will be time enough and he does n't give a damn . He digs her how her brother was queer and about the fruity silk shirts he always wore in all kinds of nigger colors , she 'd just cut him in , see , on how she had bought the boy all these silk shirts , and that the brother sucked everybody at the mine , and on and on , and she 's screeching and flapping and belting the shit out of him , and now he says there 's a real sweet stink rising , and she tries to pitch him out , but he 's got his talons deep in her tail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twists and doubles and sweats and even somehow gets her feet once against his chest , and , boy , he says he is flying blind but there is nothing like it ! " Jones drank beer to let Castle and Mick get a few choice pent-up expletives off their chests . Himebaugh was pale . " I 'll be goddamned ! " muttered Fisher , now smiling broadly . " So they 're crashing around on that bed , blood and feathers flying , she clawing at his eyes , him grabbing a fistful of her hair and arching her head back so she ca n't take good aim , and first thing you know they 're whamming away in rhythm and she 's clutching him in the ass and warbling his goddamn name and they both come in a tremendoussimultaneous explosion and collapse in a tremor of secondaryspasms . " Castle whapped the table and Mick , in his peculiar twitter , cried out the name of the Savior over and over . Beer was spilled . Jones calmly examined his mutilated cigar . Himebaugh 's eyes lacked focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , reaching for a wet pack of cigarettes on the table . " But , Jesus , Lou ! Do you mean to say  --  did she  --  ? " Mick lacked the words for it . " Yeah , " said Jones . " She liked it . " " Goddamn ! " boomed Castle . " It 's too much ! "  | " They both admit it was the greatest fuck they 've ever had , if not indeed the greatest in world history . The rookery is a wreck , all whipped and shredded , blood here and there . Carl is nearly blind , but he can see that those flawless haunches are brilliantly striped and maybe for good . He apologizes about what he 'd said , explains he really never knew her brother , he was just trying to snap her out of her doldrums . She says never mind , does n't matter . He says he is sure he was a great guy , the greatest , had to be : brother of a woman like her . And silk shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Carl 's arms and he ends up passing the night there . They couple three or four more times during the night and this morning . No comparisonto the first round , but it is warm and satisfying , quoth our hero . He adds that his old lady really has her feathers up when he appears for breakfast this morning , clawed and bloodied and reeking of strange persons , but he 's feeling so afloat he does n't even take the bother to apologize , just eats his Wheaties in blissful silence , and wafts on down to the shop , advising everybody it is spring . " Jones pulled Himebaugh 's untapped beer toward him , leaned back and drained it , turned his attention to relighting the cigar : all signs that the tale was told . It was too much for Castle 's restricted vocabulary . There was no expletive to do it justice . Finally , he just shook his tanned jowls and said , " What a story , man ! " " If it do n't beat all ! " chirped Mick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron . " Sometimes I think most of us poor bastards just do n't know how to live . This corrupt lunatic is  --  really !  --  " He paused for effect and looked around at the others : " He 's a goddamn genius ! " " Yeah , you said it ! " laughed Wally Fisher . He propped back on two legs again . " Goddamn genius ! " " It 's a fucking outrage , that 's what it is ! " Castle laughed , relocatingwords . His voice banged in the still room . On the television , somebody won $33 . Camera panned on the audience . Pasty sheepfacedsmiles . Hands silently and dutifully slapping each other . " But goddamn if it ai n't true to life ! " " And twice as beautiful ! " added Mick over his sopped apron , and they all laughed . He still sat , but now Miller 's interest in another beer had passed . He could n't help but keep Himebaugh in the edge of his eye : the man sat silently , shaking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way that his elbow was pressed into his groin.  | " Miller , " said Fisher , " you ought a publish this ! " The thought delighted them all . " What 'll we call it ? " Miller asked drily . " A Child 's Visit to a Whorehouse ? " " Now do n't take the fun out of it ! " said Castle . " What if this sort of animal madness were set up as a precept forhumanity ? " Himebaugh asked earnestly . He cleared his throat , shifted his position , straightened up . " What would we all turn into ? It 's ghastly ! " " Aw , shit , Ralph , " Castle protested , " that 's stupid ! " Himebaugh glared at the shoe salesman from across the round table , soft underlip turned in . " That 's goddamn plain stupid ! " Castle repeated , rankled to have had such a good story tainted . " Stupid ! But this is grotesque ! This disaster  --  I mean , in the middle of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that beast  --  you 're all beasts ! " Himebaugh was losing control . " I thought it was pretty funny , " said Fisher . " You 're a beast , " Jones said to him . Himebaugh glanced darkly at their laughter . Mick butted in : " Who do you suppose that 'd be , Tiger ? Reckon that 'd be Oxford Clemens ' sister ? " " Sure , " said Miller . Bigmouth had given way on the screen to a smoking hunter . Miller lit one . " Dinah . I always wondered where Ox got those fancy shirts . I thought he stole them . " " You used to get a little of that , did n't you , Tiger ? " Castle asked . Miller smiled . For several days , he had felt his past sticking to him here like shreds of flypaper . " Well , she was n't the toughest teacher we had in high school , " he said , " but she was the sincerest . " Mick stretched himself through the loose laughter to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the bar . He got a bar rag to finish mopping the table . " That was sure one goddamn story , " he coda 'd . " Beasts ! " bleated Himebaugh insistently and wiped his mouth nervously with a clean handkerchief . Castle snorted , and they started in again . For an instant something seems to hover . . . enters him : his eyes open . They turn to her , blink in recognition . A hand faces its pale palm to her and she takes it . She assures him . The phone rang . Everyone was gone . Miller , dozing upright in  |p116his  swivel chair , listened to it jangle . Would n't answer it . Looked at his watch . Seven . Home was an empty icebox and an unmade bed , did n't feel like going there . Too bushed to go elsewhere . Still it rang , jarring him . He looked at it . Angry black fish , eyeing him with one gleam of reflection . He took it off the spit . " Hello ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Marcella . He awoke . Giovanni was conscious and his condition was satisfactory . He listened to her voice , dreamed up questions to keep her talking , knew now there was a better place to go . But there was little more she could tell him . Except that Giovanni had been visited in the mine by the Virgin , a vision , so to speak . Yes , he could publish that . She had come to him in the form of a white bird.  |p119While  the mine disaster reduced itself to numbers , repercussions , and causes , Eleanor Norton turned all her time  --  for school was closed of course  --  to a review of messages received in Carlyle and West Condon , reasoning that it was the Carlyle crisis that had driven them here , so a relevancy might well be expected . On the first page of each of her logbooks were the words , which she took from the apocryphal book of Baruch : " Walk in the presence of the light of this book , that you may be illuminated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonitions to live a deeper life and lessons in the cosmological verities . . . A flower plucked , a fish 's leap : the distant star is tortured ! . . . preceded in Carlyle by simple warnings of imminent danger . But by Saturday she had read them all six times , and had begun to discover , beneath the placid surface , an emergent design of revelation . There was , for example , that peculiar reference of a year ago Decemberto. . . the one who is to come . At the time , already harassed , she had supposed it to be merely another in the succession of warnings in Carlyle , for the " one " was to bring her suffering and injustice , and Domiron had urged her not to fear him . But now she remembered that she had received similar cautions three or four times in the past  --  she searched them out , astonished to discover the almost identical wording . Had she misread them all along ?  |p120Do  not despair if One should come . Faith and truth have fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lust for illusory things of the body . Oh men of the earth ! only a cleansing can preserve you ! Wash the earth from your hands and feet , and cast your eyes to the limitless stars ! Did this confirm her theory that the earth had formerly enjoyed a higher aspect of intensity ? Was a cleansing to occur ? And she , was she to be the agent ? And then there was that exceedingly strange message , only a month old , that told her to ... look to the east ! look to the west ! the feet tug downward , but the spirit soars ! The east : the source of light , of course . The west . . . West Condon ? And the tugging downward , was that the miners ? These messages troubled her , yet consoled her as well ; nevertheless , it was altogether clear that more remained to be revealed . On Saturday night , learning that there was no longer any hope left for the men still in the mine and that the toll was fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received the following message : As the body suffers , so is the mind cleansed . The seven starred image of life 's oscillation from abysses to cusps shadows forth in morning 's east , but a firmness is forthcoming . Is nine a number ? Is eight a number ? Lead men to numberlessness ! In the earth a harsh tremor , above .. . an infinite repose . Avoid the illusory , the present accident of conjoined particles , and seek wisdom with love ! For a time is to come , and the soul will swim in the vast and empty sea of enlightenment ! Does the body tremble ? Chastiseit , mind , with mocking laughter ! Domiron bids you ! She was disturbed to discover that this new message was largely composed of parts of old ones , but the new ordering of these parts not only provided her startling insights into the events of the moment , but also revealed to her how blind and complacent she had become . It was there all the time , and she had not seen it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had accused Domiron of betrayal ! And now other wonders came to mind : the frequent minor accidents she had suffered recently around the house , the disappear/ante of objects , the unseasonal autumn blizzards and the strange damp January , not to mention the increasing turbulence of the messages , the ruptured syntax and enigmatic juxtapositions , all a kind of static , as it were , electromagnetic countersignals from malfeasant forces . Customarily , Domiron instructed her through her right hand , though occasionally through her left , and , in certain urgent situations , directly through her voice . By my light , thou shalt flee the darkness ! he had cried in her throat more than once . She had attempted , over the years , to assist Wylie in attaining a communication with the higher forces in the universe , but , though he honestly tried , he had almost no success . Domiron explained privately to her that . . . if even the faithful are few , how rare then the master ! and that passive natures , themselves noble and receptive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any event , it was common knowledge who Womwom ( Domiron'sname for Wylie 's soul at the seventh aspect ) once was  --  when the time was ripe , he would play his significant role . Have faith ! AU that is , I am , I am all that never was . All that shall be , I have been . Sunday , the eleventh , a thick fog pressed at her morning windows . Fog pleased her usually , misted the hard forms that so often deluded and misled her , provided fleeting images of the essential emptiness , but today it betokened her own uncertainties , her difficulties in finding the true way . It curled and wisped through the black branches of their tall elms , like her thoughts floating elusively through the stretched fingers of her mind . Now an object took shape , became an inference , a cipher for action , but then it faded behind the fog 's nervous curtain.  |p122She  sought a clarification to last night 's message , but none came . She considered it . Last night she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really anything more than the customary exhortationto maintain spiritual discipline . She understood , of course , the next ascendant sign  --  now befogged !  --  but what of the forthcoming firmness ? For herself alone or for others ? Lead men , the message said . Was she to lead them to the " firmness " in the time that " is to come " ? Or is the firmness merely the vernal closing of the cycle ? Does n't the message in fact dismiss the mine disaster as irrelevant ? The " harsh tremor " in the earth does not disturb the " infinite repose " above , in the higher aspects . And " the time to come " is nothing more than the soul 's return to its source , is it not ? Was Domiron trying to tell her that her own death was near ? But then why would he ask her to " lead men " ? Or might it have to do somehow with the " One " to come ? And why should he draw especial attention to the sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenological , or was there a more destructive intent , a parabolic reference to former devastations upon the earth ? And there were the numbers to be considered , the number of miners who perished , of course , ninetyeight , but if thought of in a series , nine and then eight , then the next number would be seven . . . but what of that ? For it is to " numberlessness " he asked her to lead men . She inspected the whole band and all channels , but neither radio nor television provided her clues , although the radio repeated frequentlythe toll of ninety-eight miners missing or dead . She copied down what names they gave , but they proved meaningless to her . Now , if something of cosmic significance were to happen , how would it be signaled ? Is n't a fire deep in the earth as telling as a prodigy in the sky ? Perhaps , but there were few precedents . Of course , there was the evidence of lithomancy , and even the scales of fish had prophesied . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . an infinite repose . Outside , the fog lifted , but the day remained overcast . Lunch came and went , but she had little appetite . Wylie napped after , then went for an afternoon walk  --  she had been greatly blessed : she knew she could never have survived the humiliations and suffering of the last fifteen years without Wylie 's belief in her . She read once more thep123past two years of communications , and struggled with the enigma of these present words . Impulsively , she counted them . . . ninetyeight ! She started , counted again . Her heart raced . No doubt about it ! Lead men to numberlessness ! Of course ! Domiron was trying to tell her to lead men away from . . . from a head-count of mortalities to his message ! to the limitless and ununumbered truth of his word ! " Does it matter these have died ? " he was in effect asking . " Bring all to wisdom ! " She nearly leapt for excitement ! And it was in this state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a copy of the special edition of the West Condon Chronicle , announcing in headlines the miraculous rescue of Giovanni Bruno . " Wylie ! " she cried . " I knew it ! I knew it ! I knew it before you came back ! Domiron told me ! " " What ! You mean about the rescue ? " " Yes ! It was all there ! I wanted to shout it out , but I was alone ! " " But how  --  ? " " It started with the numbers . Nine and eight in a series . Next comes seven , and it  --  " " Seven ? " " Yes , and it is seven that leads to numberlessness and to the One ! " She was so excited she hardly knew what she was saying . Everything fit at last ! It was happening ! She even felt . , certain she had begun thinking about Bruno before Wylie came in . " That 's funny , " said Wylie , as though disquieted . " Yes , do n't you  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other men trapped in a room with Bruno , but they died . " He paused , but his gentle blue gaze , aglitter with a kind of awe , was on her unwavering . She lowered herself slowly to sit on the sofa . " How many ? " she asked in fear . " There were six others , " he said . " With Bruno , they made seven . " They said nothing more for a long time . There was much to consider . A fine snow , more like frost , flecked the land overnight , and Monday dawned bright and cold . Eleanor dressed in warm wool and , after poached egg on toast , slipped on her winter coat and galoshes , fur cap , gloves and scarf and walked out to the mine , shep124had decided upon it last night , walked out , as it were , to the point of origin . The town , as she passed through it , or at least this northwest segment of it , seemed strangely unaffected by the disaster that had rocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If anything , there was a fresh renewal , a mocking sense of gladness , brick and painted homes adazzle under the harsh blue sky , toys and bikes in a gay scatter , naked elms casting long graceful shadows on the gilt pavement . But what was an exhilarating crispness in town became a bitter cold at its edge . Wind smarted her eyes , tears converting the blue radiance into a blurred and angry glare . She pinched the scarf up tight against her throat , but the cold blew through it . The mine road was rutted and her booted feet made poor progress on it . After about ten minutes , she stopped , looked back at the town behind her . She had barely begun . It would take her at least an hour , She faltered . What was the point of it , anyway ? But something vital in her , something more than mere will , some deep-celled quality forged in some other life 's trial , pivoted her once more and thrust her forward down the old road to Deepwater No. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of a brownish clay the color of bruised fruit . Short bushes grew wildly along the ditches to either side of her , and occasional tree sprouts stuck up like stripped switches , but desolation and death was mostly what she saw through her tears . Much of the time , she walked with eyes closed , her face a numb mask , the air gathering in icy pockets within her lungs . Her legs grew very weary , then indifferent , then seemed even to strengthen , discovering a needled warmth in motion . She walked head down , staring at her feet , counting the steps . She began to see the burdened feet of humanity , treading through their endless centuriesof despair . Each gray-booted foot appeared before her like a birth , and died just as quickly as the other materialized to replace it , a ceaseless recurrence , and yet each step was different , unique , fell on different soil , angled away from hazards , delayed a moment longer or perished in a quickened stumble , and always , cushioned by soft earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of the progress . . . a loss . The voice beside her took her wholly by surprise . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " What did you say ? " " Can we give you a lift ? It 's a cold morning . " Inside the old car there were two men , both in miners ' clothes . They looked to be Italians , the driver a large dark man , bold-jawed and perhaps in/temperate , the other slender with a generous hooked nose and crinkly smile . " No , no , thank you , " she stammered . " I . . . I 'm just out for the walk . " How foolish that sounded ! Timidly , she smiled . " Are you sure ? " asked the driver . He had a large voice , resonant and willful , but friendly . " It 's a pretty rough hike . " " How much farther is it ? " " About ten , fifteen minutes more . You can see the small rise up there ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left . " She could see nothing , but she nodded . " I 'll walk , " she said . " But thank you very much . " They shrugged and left her . She watched the car lurch and rattle away from her , then turned her eyes once more to her feet . She had been close to something and had lost it , but still she could hold before her that which she had had and investigate it with her mind . The unthought thought that the men in the car had blocked was this : Though each step , each appearance and disappearance , was singularlyunique , the spirit lodged in them was of an unalterable whole , inseparable from past steps , a part of future ones  --  it was not the mere passage of finite existences themselves with which one had to reckon , but with passage itself ; motion , not the moving thing . And though opposites her feet  --  this , too , had been at the edge of her broken thoughts  --  though apparently isolate and contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duality disappeared . A triangle occurred to her , but something suddenly unpleasant about it repulsed her . She looked up , wearied of her feet , and discovered the mine buildings just ahead of her , crouched in a sparse grove of barren trees . To her right , distantly , a small rise , itself almost treeless . Above , a potbellied watertank that overlorded the squat buildings ; beneath it , cars sat in a gravel lot , including that which had passed her . She was glad she had walked the whole distance , yet an edge of disappointment frustrated complete satisfaction : her meditations had not equaled the promise of the previous direct experience . An odor of sulfur here , soot in the air , and near the buildings the sky seemed to yellow . Slate like black jasper crunched underfoot . Behind the watertower reared an insectlike structure , housed in at the top , about four stories high . She guessed it was where the coal was processed  --  was it sorted or cleaned or something ?  --  for a chute yawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , letting its eccentric shape sear into her underconsciousness  --  there was nothing like it in her memory  --  while her thoughts sputtered andp126bubbled away . A line came to her suddenly from somewhere , she fumbled in her coat pocket , found paper and pencil : Out of fog : new signals ; in clarity : the gathering of . . . fog . She seemed to wake , discovered for the first time there were people about her , mostly miners , motion was minimal , there seemed to be nothing happening , some glanced at her , but none paid attention . She sighed , secretly relieved , for the sense of awakening in public had startled her . She read the message . It did not seem to be from Domiron . Some lesser aspect probably . Of these , she trusted few , and doubted now . On the contrary , she reasoned , fog is a false emptying that adds interest to the mystified forms , while clarity , simplifying perception , liberated the mind from counteractive effort . Nevertheless , she pocketed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty . Over one grimy brick office building , a wind sock jabbed rigidly . A northwest wind , and it pierced her thoroughly . The sock poked its signal at the nearby rise , which lifted its nubbed crest just over the fretwork of denuded trees to the east of the buildings . Too squat for a hill really : a hummock , a soft knoll . On a concrete wall , next to a steel door , she found a sign that read : CAUTION ! No SCUFFLINGOR PLAYING ! NO SMOKING ! This is a Closed Light Mine  --  Smoking in or Carrying Smoking Materials into This Mine is aVIOLATION OF THE LAW ! Scratched on the wall with coal was : Look ! This Means You ! with an arrow aimed at the word " Scuffling . " A few adolescent obscenities , cartooned nude women , male genitals , no clues . In red : JE$U$ SAVES ! Why do n't you ? 1st Nat'l Bank . She counted the words on the printed sign : twenty-eight  --  it meant nothing to her . Four sevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , true , contained a certain meaning applicable to her : to be careful not to become childish about this crisis , nor to seek unnecessary trouble ; but , given the rest of it , it was probably merest accident . What was a " closed light mine " ? She did n't know . Were the lights enclosed , or was the mine defined somehow as " light " ? Perhaps there was , in a sense , light trapped in the mine that needed now to be released . But all these directions seemed futile . And then , suddenly , beside the steel door , as though it were materializing , appearing there now for the first time , she saw a telephone ! So certain was she that she had marched this bitter way to receive a message , that she impulsivelylifted the phone off the hook and put it to her ear.  | " Excuse me , lady , can I help you ? " She nearly dropped the phone in fright , fumbling returned it to its cradle , apologized to the tall miner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry ! I was only curious , and  --  " The miner smiled . " Oh well , go ahead and listen , if you like . " Eleanor calmed . " Thanks , " she said , " but I 'm just getting in your way , I 'm afraid . I hope you 'll pardon me . " They exchanged smiles , and she walked away . Unexpectedly , she came upon a Salvation Army canteen , still operating although the two women inside were packing things away into carton boxes . There was coffee , though , steaming hot against the chill in her , and they seemed delighted to have a customer . They apologized that the doughnuts were from Saturday , but , suddenly hungry , Eleanor accepted one anyway . It was rubbery and tough , sugarless , but sweet to her . When the women learned she was not herself a widow , had lost no one out here , they grew talkative , but Eleanor was too weak to listen . A sense of displacement was overtakingher ; exhaustion threatened to buckle her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could never walk back again . The women told her that all the bodies had been recovered and were being prepared by morticians at the high school gymnasium . They describedthe hideous condition of some . Funerals tomorrow and Wednesday . They produced anecdotes of rescue , which Eleanor pretended to attend . Their hollow voices clucked and moaned at the horror . Well , did they think they would escape it ? Sensational slaughter made people count death exceptional . The two miners who had offered her the ride entered , and she asked if they might be going back soon ; she would like to take them up on their offer . They laughed and said Sure , introduced themselves as Mr. Ferrero and Mr. Bonali . They had coffee first , and Eleanor received an account of Mr. Bonali 's escape from the disaster . The ride back into town was surprisingly brief . On foot , it was a healthy hike , of course , but the cold wind had distorted the distance . She told the two men that she was a teacher at the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had thought so when she had told him her name , because he had a daughter , a freshman this year , who had mentioned her . Angela . Angie . Eleanor said , oh , of course , Angela Bonali , but she could n't bring the girl 's face to mind . Mr. Ferrero said it must be a tough job , he would n't have the courage to face up to a pack of teen-age monsters every day . She replied that she enjoyed her work , but regretted the absence of spontaneity andp128receptivity in today 's youth . Of course , she did n't mean Angela , she was only speaking generally . " No , I know what you mean , " Mr. Bonali concurred . " She 's a wise kid , thinks she 's pretty smart . They all do . " " Well , we were n't angels , " observed Mr. Ferrero , and Mr. Bonali , laughter booming , agreed with that . Eleanor explained to them that she had to pick up some papers to be graded in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , although of course her purpose was to visit the gymnasium . The mine company guards at the gymnasium door would not allow her to enter . Beyond their bulked shoulders she could see the dark cadaver lumps on the floor under army blankets , fewer than she had expected , white light raying in on them from the opaque windows back of the bleachers , dust hovering gloomily . On the basketball scoreboard : WEST CONDOM 14 , VISITORS 11 . Eleanor rarely thought about numbers  --  she respected the numerologists , but the everpresentprime numbers were too vague to satisfy her  --  but , out of an old prejudice from childhood , multiples of seven always caught her eye . Seven , fourteen , twenty-eight , thir  --  well , yes ! of course ! the toll ! incredible ! As though on cue , Colin Meredith appeared before her , a tall supple-limbed boy with guileless eyes and perceptive brow whom Dorniron had led to her . His long blond hair , soft and silky , flopped loosely on his pale brow . He seemed extremely excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , had thus far disappointed Eleanor faintly : he was too playfully interested still in flying saucers and green men from Mars to grasp the profounder truths of essence , transience , emanations , and reabsorptions . Nonetheless , the soil was fertile , his was an aristocratic spirit , and , though cautious ( she suddenlythought of the sign at the mine ! ) , she entertained large hopes for him . Now , he said he had been looking for her , had come here hoping to find her . " Mrs. Norton , " he gasped , once they had slipped out of earshot of others , " do you remember the message you gave me , the one from , from . . . " " Domiron . " It was not to tell him , for he knew it well ; only he feared yet to speak it aloud . " Yes , the one that said about the long uphill struggle one must endure , out of  --  do you remember ?  --  ' out of the abyss of darkness , ' you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saw that his truep129growth had begun . " I received perhaps the most important messages of my long life over this past weekend , " she told him solemnly . " Cosmic purposes of enormous significance are to be revealed to us soon . Can you visit me later this week ? " " Sure ! Would Friday be soon enough ? " She smiled . " I hope so , " she replied . Eleanor and Wylie returned home from the Tuesday mass funerals , depressed and , for her part , confused . So many deaths at once , the irregular and paradoxical messages she was receiving , the bitter weather  --  Eleanor was frightened , felt weak and light-minded before the challenge , but could not resist its excitement . She had tried to visit the rescued miner , Mr. Bruno , yesterday , but was told he had not awakened from his coma . She would try again tomorrow , if he lived still . Yet , she was sure he would . She understood at this point all too little , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hung up her coat , fixed sandwiches for both of them , but finally did n't eat her own , decided first to read the evening paper . Wylie sank sleepily into the armchair . She felt a kind of peculiar dizziness as she reached for the paper . She glanced at the headlines  --  and started up , her heart pounding : not only had Giovanni Bruno recovered from his coma , but he had announced a visitation by what he called the Holy Virgin during his entombment ! She had appeared to him , he said , in the form of a . . . a white bird ! A white bird ! the image of the soul , the volatile principle , life itself ! messenger of peace and prodigies ! symbol through man 's story of spiritualism and sublimation ! of thoughts and of angels ! the color and creature of mystic illumination ! ecstasis out of time and freed from space ! " Oh Domiron ! " she cried , and fell to the floor . " Let me have light ! " She rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swayed , expanded , burst into flame like a skyrocket . She was on the couch . Her head throbbed . Wylie was leaning over her , patting her hand . She breathed as though against resistances . He withdrew the thermometer from her armpit , shook his head as he read it , gazed compassionately down upon her over the pale rims of his spectacles , his round chin doubling . " Over a hundred , " he said . " You 've got to slow down a little . " " Wylie . . . what happened ? "  | " You were reading the paper . Then you . .. you cried out , and , well , you sort of passed out . " " Did you read about it ? " He nodded . " Wylie , what did I say ? " He hesitated , looked away from her . " You said , first you said , Domiron , ' and then , Let me have light . ' " " Yes . . . ?  --  " And then you said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask and thou shalt be confirmed . " " That 's right . " " What do you think . . . what do you think it means , Wylie ? " " I . . . I do n't know , dear . " " I do . " It had been on her mind since Sunday night , since Thursday , perhaps even before . " I must see Mr. Bruno tonight , " she said . " Eleanor , please ! You have a fever ! " " It does n't matter . Nothing else does . " As she sat up , a chill vibrated through her . " I have to go , Wylie . " He pressed his lips together , his eyes pained , but then he smiled . " All right , " he said . " I 'll go with you . " The heated rhythm of fever disturbed the uniformity of Eleanor 's perceptions , and what happened at the hospital had afterwards to be reconstructed . People , there were many , though she noticed few in particular . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the antiseptic odor . A fat dark priest was there , old women . One of these , wizened and brown , gnarled with misery but not with great wisdom , was the rescued miner 's mother ; she spoke no English . Eleanor , impelled by forces far greater than herself , had reached his bedside . He was gaunt and spectral , high-browed with hollowed eyes and fragile as she had known he would be , still passing , thought Eleanor headily , into substance . There were other women outside , a coarse mulelike woman named Mrs. Collins , whose husband , GiovanniBruno 's working partner in the mine , had been killed by the disaster . One of the seven , Eleanor learned , and another chill rattled through her . Other widows , the Collins child  --  Eleanor knew the girl from school , a shy and weak-minded student . And Giovanni 's sister Marcella  --  when their eyes met , Eleanor discovered a friendshipalready eons old . " Wylie ! " she had whispered . " The girl ! She is one of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never be excised , opened wide her brown eyes , taught delicacy andp131gaiety to her ready smile , graced the motions of her limbs . The old woman said her boy had died and come back to life ! Marcella translated it , her warmth transforming it , elevating it to essential truth . Marcella , like Eleanor herself , lived , she saw , in a responsive universe . By his bedside , Eleanor contemplated the strange and inexorable processes that had transported her here , suddenly envisionedthe confused complex of her past as a series of concentric circles , each smaller and pulling toward the center . . . and was n't this the very sense of aspects ? Shards of old prophecies broke kaleidoscopically on her mind , as memories of old conflicts , old conquests , streamed out into pattern , rationally ordered . He opened his eyes and looked at her . A sudden terror gripped her : he was Italian , a Roman Catholic , a stranger , she knew nothing about him , a laborer in the mines , would he find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rippled over his gaunt face like watery masks , and if she were wrong . . . ? Ask and thou shalt be confirmed ! And , indeed , had n't Mrs. Collins all but confirmed it ? That messagehad excited Eleanor , even though a reading of it was disappointing . A simple Christian admonition finally , which the Collins woman with equal simplicity equated to stale dreams of a Last Judgment . Eleanor could not help becoming impatient with the Christians and their adolescent clubbiness , their absurd dualities , concern with the physical body , their chosen-people complex . . . even though the Bible itself , before Domiron , had been her chief guide . Now , the woman believed that something  --  perhaps even the Second Coming  --  must happen on the eighth of February , finding this implication in her dead husband 's note , and she was bullish and tense and she had power . She led a group called the " Evening Circle " ; Eleanor was invited to attend the Sunday night meeting , but , for the moment , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood clearly , in spite of her feverish state of mind , the threat that the Collins woman posed : it was the threat of ignorance . But , in any case , she had to agree with the woman , events of supreme importancewere in the air , although the function and date hardly appealed to her , especially since they had never been mentioned by her own sources . Of course , Mr. Collins had been a preacher , it was quite natural that his imagery should be lower-class Christian ( and mis/spelled at that ! ) , he could not be blamed , and there was above all a prodigious , an awesome , coincidence of interest in Giovanni Bruno . Ask and thou shalt be confirmed ! In that brief moment beside his bed , before they discovered her there and ordered her away , in that instant when he looked up at her , through her terror she drove the question : " Are you the One who is to come ? " His eyes burned through her . His breath came shortly . He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , eyes closed . Wylie explained calmly to them about her fever , and she apologized , saying she had come in here looking for a place to rest . Marcella had invited them all to return Friday evening , but by Thursday , Eleanor could wait no longer . Though free from fever , she now suffered from a head cold and sore throat , and had stayed home from this first day of school . Messages since Tuesday evening had appeared one on the heels of another , and all arrowed upon the same incredible event , long foretold , but terrifying in its realization : Giovanni Bruno 's body had been invaded by a higher being ! Contact had been established ! She had to take extreme care . So far as she knew , she was the only person alive who realized it , the entire burden of keeping the connectionalive was on her shoulders  --  a foolish move and it was lost ! She hardly slept , though feared sleeplessness that it might weaken her . She distrusted antibiotics : they muddled her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult , in the transpiercing of aspects there would be problems . Had it ever really happened before ? Surely , but always there must have been final failure , the contact interrupted , its significance distorted , the agent body destroyed ; and always the walls were built , introceptive minds buried behind the rubble mounds of power and dogma , the charismatic moment forgotten , misconstrued , the light hopelessly flickering out , extinguished by the terrible density of this earth . And now , over fifteen years of resolute intransigent preparation  --  no ! more ! centuries !  --  were coming to bear upon this delicate moment , visible within the fragility of human time and space ! Every breath she breathed seemed fraught with peril , yet starred and eternal as well , each a cosmic breath . And no sooner had the connectionbeen established , but from somewhere , from within , or fromp133denser aspects , from something malefic in the universe perhaps , something she did not understand , there came resistance : fever , disease , attacks from all sides on her body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : so frail a fortress ! She trembled , searching out a greater strength . Her mortality shadowed her , clung to her ankles . . . yes , she would die soon , she must make haste , a second lost and it was for nothing  --  she must go tonight ! The hospital stood on its vast acreage , distant from West Condon 's center , under a bright glitter of stars . Eleanor examined them hastily : all seemed in order . A glance at her watch told her Leo , invisible , was ascendant , not the most favorable of signs . Wylie panted along at her side , opened the hospital door for her . Unhappily , Marcella and her brother were not alone , additional proof to Eleanor of the sudden gathering of malign forces , particularlysince the intruder was a newspaperman , Mr. Miller of the local paper . She knew him not at all , but one glance warned her to be on guard . Her life had been so often disrupted by newsmen , she had come to regard the trade as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , but a cruelty lurked at his mouth 's edges , and his smooth face 's manly mask did not conceal the ravenous gleam of his dark eyes . Yes , yes , she knew him . She spoke idly , stalling for time . What was she doing here ? Hah ! let him wonder to the end of leis days ! She sensed that he already had reached the girl and she was in danger . Yet , there was a well-disposed order to the man : she would watch and wait . Wylie engaged Mr. Miller in aspects of the precomatose phase of carbon monoxide poisoning , and Eleanor , tense , but concentrating her tension in the grip on her damp handkerchief , asked Marcella about her brother . Marcella looked at Eleanor 's glasses , at her graying hair : " You must be the lady my brother has been asking about , " she said . Eleanor caught her breath . Her sore throat contracted . They went in . Apparently he slept , but then his eyes opened . When he saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropped it , Marcellaleft them . " Am I to call you Giovanni ? " she asked . He nodded . " Giovanni , " she continued , seeking the direction , " from whence came you ? " He did not reply . His eyes closed . " Giovanni ! " she whispered anxiously  --  she must hold on to it !  --  " Giovanni ! " Again his eyes opened . " Giovanni , did you come a great distance ? " He nodded . " From another aspect ? " He hesitated , then nodded . He trusted her ! Shep134licked her lips , tried to grasp the difficulties the other faced in communicatingto her , kept her unwavering gaze locked on his . " Have you . . . have you any messages ? " He did not reply , but continued to stare at her . So tenuous ! She swallowed and felt them at her throat . " The white bird , " she ventured , " does it signal . . . a new life ? " He nodded . " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time then ! " she whispered , and at his nod a great relief washed over her . With time , she could do it . She felt the malignant bodies disperse and retreat . Reentering to stand beside her , the girl Marcella watched . She seemed undisturbed , somehow even pleased . Wylie , she noticed , had also come into the room . The newspaperman was gone . Giovanni Bruno seemed weary , but she wished a confirmation with witnesses present . " Are you the One who is to come ? " she asked . He nodded , shut his eyes . In a moment , he was sleeping . But it was done . Eleanor looked at Wylie and at Marcella , and saw that they had understood . In part , at least . The burden was lighter . " One a them cutters makes the goddamn bugdust fly around like grass outa a electric lawnmower , " said Vince Bonali . In the mine , voices rose and fell peculiarly , bouncing off a face of coal here , disappearing down a channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near water . Miller walked in a slight crouch , the hunchingslump of the adolescent feeling his new height : there was headroomdown here , but it had to be taken on faith . Always , out in front , the roof seemed to cave downward . The lamp on his head , like the illuminative middle eye , shot its dull beam wherever he looked , was as jittery as his head was , steadied on nothing unless he could hold still , and that , plus the helmet 's weight , was giving him a stiff neck . " What ? The climb ? Well now , Senator , that 's due to the slant in the layers . In these parts , they always dip toward the northwest . "  |p135Under  the shelling of the miners ' bitching , Davis remained outwardly calm , gathering influence over the know-nots of the inspection party . " I see . Uh , the northwest .

" " Oh yes . Very good . " Any goddamn topic to free the mind 's eye from the hovering mass . There were splits in the roof , carvings , grooves , it was oppressively close , always tested Miller 's nerve , had since his first visits as a boy , but more so today in this mine that had seen so much violence , heaps of rubble here and there , an all too plentiful evidence of falls : Chicken Licken 's panic . He knew Ox Clemens ' urge to have a smoke , caught in this black hive of tight deep stalls , found his own fingers more than once at his emptied shirt pocket . On edge , he got a distortedview of things . The shadows pitched by the whitewashed timbers turned into black crucifixes .

" No , that was his Dad , right to the point . " What rock dusting ? " Bonali 's voice came through loud and clear . The whole walk he had been edging in his gripes , but Davis had kept the inspectors ' ears , and Bonali himself , in spite of his reputation , seemed edgy , overcautious . " Any inspector ever been down in this mine , they 've bragged on the place looking like the inside of a goddamn hospital , Vince . " " Which room , Davis ? I take it you mean the morgue . " The deeper they got , the blacker it got , the whitewashed timbers coated with soot and coke , the rock dust all but nonexistent  --  in Miller 's mind , as surely in most , the issue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls sucked up the light from their lamps .

" And then he was standing on the spot , before he understood properly where they were , that they had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some contended for another room where drills lay with cap screws missing , while Davis and Osborne snorted at the electric arc theorists by drawing lines of force , declaring for ignition by cigarettes found alongside Clemens and Rosselli . Bonali , a little puffed up from his victories on the walk here , ridiculed : " You ca n't light a fire with cigarettes , Davis . " But the absence of matches or lighter did not impress the inspectors . The former could have been consumed by the explosion , the latter picked up during rescue  --  or perhaps might still be in a dead man 's hands . . . it was doubtful anyone had checked . What did impress the inspectors was that work had been going on in a squeezing area . An unnerving blue cap now crowned the yellow flame in the safety lamp . " Who declared this room safe ? " a visiting UMW man asked angrily , and there were no answers , Osborne the night mine manager sneaking out of earshot , although Barney Davis did protest that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the disaster this section was now largely shortcircuited . Besides , this face was n't being worked ; Rosselli and Clemensmust have slipped back here for the smoke , against orders . Nevertheless , most agreed : the area should have been sealed off . Miller followed the lead of others and put his ear to the face : soft buzz like a fine bubbling . And here , in this tight black pit , which was crushed and shaken down , damp and dusty at once , in a gloomy intangible nimbus of CH4 , his legs cramped from kneeling , ducking , spine pinched , the air dead and stagnant , among furtive black faces mostly alien and isolate , Tiger Miller suffered for one febrile moment the leap and joy and glory of the state basketball championships  --  bright flash of meaning , a possible faith in a possible thing : that they could win ! and there were globes of white light and wide-open space and a thundering excitement , a fast responsive body , patterns that worked , challenge , rescue , always a resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . a grace on him . Standing straight , he knocked his helmet against the roof : drums rolled funereally , blunt reminder , from the insensate earth , of the real . " But the evidence ? "  | " Well , we first notice for soot and coke , Tiger , burnt fibers , paper , for polished surfaces . Here , you see how this rib has got rounded off ? Well , that 's by coarse pieces flying by , and you can tell the directionplain enough . " Coarse pieces of Oxford Clemens . " And then , now look at this : see how the dust is streamlined here ? The front side of this post is like sandblasted and then little eddy currents travel to the rear here  --  see ?  --  and leave them little dust deposits . Way these here mines is cut up , the forces they go ever which way . But when you come on a point where all the forces go away from it in ever direction , why , you know something went off here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever which direction . They raked up the pieces and deposited them in a rubber bag . The bag was light and they guessed it was a little man . But the fingerprintexpert identified the remains as not one but two persons , both once sizable . Clemens and Rosselli , like ultimate lovers cellularly conjoined , descended as one to their common grave . " And look here , Tiger . You see how the materials here on the floor is all different sizes ? Well , it makes sense , do n't it , that the coarser stuff is gon na get dropped first by the forces . And then it goes until you reach the dust point , and that is what is called sizing the materials . So , that 's the way you can tell how the flame and forces traversed along here . . . . " Expansion and white light , a thundering excitement : did Ox go out in a hot dream of the gilded past ? It hardly mattered . Out was out . Miller chose not to size the materials too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Kept feeling like he was walking around on a litter of human fatty tissue . She heard them as a child , a voiced flutter of angels at her bedstead . Marcella , frail and often ill , watched for them , and they sustained her . But a hatred in the house frightened them away . Growing , she rediscovered them at the altar and in nature . No longer words , but whole sensations were what they brought her . An indivisibility to life , an essential sympathy : then , everything mattered . Giovanni heard them too . In truth , perhaps they were his , not hers . Of age , she lost them , seeking them . They fled from being understood . " It is grasped whole , Marcella , but never learned . " Thus , with tenderness and patience , Eleanor leads her back to her abandoned voices.  |p139Voices  . Out of mouths , over phone cables , on the streets , in his office , out of letters , from other papers , over the teletype . Day in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , throbbed convulsively through him , emerged at his fingertips as the West Condon Chronicle . Births and deaths . The forecast of snow , low pressure , high pressure , the unseasonable seasonable cold warm rainy dry front over front . . . process revealed . Twelfth Street under repair . Rotary 's district governor visits , is " favorably impressed . " Six or eight pages twenty inches deep by eight times wide , 960 to 1,280 column inches , upwardsof 50,000 words of space , a decent novel , six days a week . Miller filled them up . Threats of war . Bingo at St. Stephen 's . Burglary in a supermarket . Cuts , heads , ads , syndicated features rescued him daily , but only from crisis , not from thrall . Afflictions , ball games , comic strips , and drunken drivers . The endless reiteration of sundered instants , grounded in the subject 's abject nature . He wanted to stop it , but once you turned it on , there was no turning it off . Grocers ' specials and Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Miller 's January went . He did n't want to see it go , but the next thing he knew , it was gone . Always tomorrow 's deadline : but he no longer wished to lose today . Goddamn Clemens and his cigarette ! The mine disaster had touched off something latently restless in him , and now he could not be satisfied . Miller felt rotten , edgy all the time . Snapped at Annie , wrote wearily , fell sullen at Mick 's . His stomach rumbled and burned and his gut softened and sank . But he had no time to think . The fleeting whimsy became a recurrent wish : he wanted to stop it . Should never have invented the written word . Kept folly hopelessly alive . Hopelessly alive : epigraph of the day . And as for folly , goddamn it , he had n't learned a thing . It took him a week to discover the classified ads Jones had planted , nearly on top of each other , in the Chronicle , and by then he was the last in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . Intimate circumstances . Inquire in person to Chronicle editor . LosT : One husband and one wool cap , same night . Reward for cap . Box " Woolly . " They called him " the widow-warmer " in Mick 's and asked him if he 'd collected yet the reward of the woolly box . He reminded themp140that , as St. James had said , the consoling of widows in their affliction was the stamp of a religion that was pure and undefiled , and , since he was the only one in the Christian crowd who had ever bothered to read the Good Old Book , no one knew enough to append : " and to keep oneself unstained from the world . " Stained and stung , daily abused , Miller sought relief  --  even a redemptionof sorts  --  in the company of Marcella Bruno . At first , in the days following the disaster , he saw her almost daily on one pretenseor another , almost always in connection with her brother . No problem that , for Bruno himself was news , nationally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision , precarious health , prolongedcomeback , even his peculiar taciturnity . Miller 's own interest in the man soon dissipated : what he saw there was the browbeaten child turned egocentered adult psychopath , now upstaging it with his sudden splash of glory  --  a waste of time . But he made good copy , and Miller sold some of it nationally . With Marcella , it was another story . For one thing , she flattered the hell out of him , the way she looked at him . And there was a grace about everything she did , laughed , walked , turned . Bright , too . And she was beautiful . Comingor going , she caught a man 's eye . But , finally , there was something that got between them . She lacked her brother 's laconic self-exaltation  --  open innocence was in fact the quality that best described her  --  but shared with him the old fiction of the universe as a closed and well-made circle . It ran deep in her , colored every phrase , and he began to hesitate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact see him and what did she expect ? There could be consequences he did n't want . And he stopped being flattered by her affection when he realized how much she admired her nut of a brother . Understandable , of course : she was born into a family already centered around him , and all she had done all her life had been one way or another related to him . And there was the weight of racial habit , the deep-rooted Italian family traditions , especially those of the beleaguered immigrant families . Nevertheless , she was old enough to judge him rightly . Roman Catholic , too , but as with all mystics , a mild disdain for the establishment , and Miller had seen Giovanni go somehow cold and angry whenever Father Baglione , the local priest , showed up . No , mainly it was her child 's view of the plenum  --  until she accepted it as the mad scatter it was , they could never get beyond banalities and sex play . Did he want to get beyond ? Apparently , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braked his assault , he nevertheless kept the phone lines open , when with her did not reject and maybe even emboldened her long glances , and somehow felt certain that , sooner or later , they 'd share a couch , whatever the circumstances of it might be . She , in turn , supposed his continuing interest in her brother , gave him status reports on his health , and talked of the people who came to see him . A recently arrived veterinarian named Wylie Norton and his schoolteacher wife were the most frequent visitors . Miller gathered that the Norton woman was a practicing medium of some sort , an automatist and old-fashioned sibyl . He had met the woman and found her harmless . More dramatic were the regular visitations of the Widow Collins and some of her Church of the Nazarene friends . These openly emotional but eminently practical people made an odd contrast with the introverted Catholic Bruno , though he welcomed them . It was mainly the accident of the work relationship between Collins and Bruno in the mine that now conjoined them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his buddy out of Christian charity toward the rejected misfit , and maybe a little bit out of wonderment at rejection itself . Seeking sainthood , Reverend Ely Collins had probably been surprised that he had had it so easy . Collins , to be popular , must surely have touched more than once on the never-dead chiliastic expectations of the lower-class Christians , and so the violence of his death , the ambiguity of his final message , the singular rescue of his buddy , and , above all , the odd coincidence  --  if it was that , and it surely was not  --  of the white bird vision he shared with Bruno , now made these people  --  especially the suddenlywidowed  --  wonder if something disastrous , perhaps worldwide in scope , might not be in the air . Their immediate fear , apparently , was the eighth of February . Their speculations amused Miller  --  who himself at age thirteen had read Revelations and never quite got over it  --  so he printed everything he thought might help them along , might seem relevant to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar practices and inexplicable happenings elsewhere , as well as everything they wished to give him . Once the emotions had settled down and the widows themselveshad established new affairs or found mind-busying work , their eccentric interests of the moment would be forgotten , of course . Which , in its way , was too bad . As games went , it was a game , and there was some promise in it . Games were what kept Miller going . Games , and the pacifying of mind and organs . Miller perceived existence as a loose concatenationp142of separate and ultimately inconsequential instants , each colored by the actions that preceded it , but each possessed of a small wanton freedom of its own . Life , then , was a series of adjustments to these actions and , if one kept his sense of humor and produced as many of these actions himself as possible , adjustment was easier . And so it was that , on his way out of the hospital on a Sunday night , first day of the runt month and the day before Giovanni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller , not a wee bit agitated in the fork after a quarter of an hour with Marcella , used his wanton freedom to reject impulsively an old precept about bedding down with the locals and picked up a nurse at the doorway , took her home with him . He had noticed her the night of the rescue , sandy-haired Tucker City girl , now more or less of West Condon , family a mixture of immigrantEnglishmen and East Europeans , he learned , bright-eyed and quick to banter . Mainly it was her long slim waist and plump butt that had drawn and kept his eye ; privately , he called her Happy Bottom , and , in bed later , she laughed gaily when he told her . What was something so great as this doing in West Condon ? Only a fool would stop to ask . They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God ! They have provoked me to anger with their vanities ! Abner Baxter paced the front room fretfully Sunday evening , waiting for Sarah to get the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white fist belted the desktop , slapped at the open Bible , thumped into the back of an easy chair . " Strive thou , O God , with them that strive with me ! " he whispered hoarsely . He paused before a large reproduction of the great bearded Peter , standingover the convulsing Sapphira , enemy of another day . White with righteous indignation , quivering with holy rage , swollen with the power of the Lord , the mighty Peter in one volcanic gesture had shown the true glory of God . " Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit ? " asked the caption.  |p141Well  , Sister Clara Collins ' " eighth of the month " heresy had harrowedthem all , but Abner restrained his wrath , biding his time . He preached in the church on the faith of Enoch and Noah , Abraham and Moses , and let them read what they would into it . Time would do her in . But for now , she still had most of them with her , prideful and perverse as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to remain steadfast in the faith and wait for the woman 's inexorablefall . Not that she 'd challenged his right to the pulpit  --  it was rather that she did n't seem to care about it . She attended his services , but seemed detached . Even in prayer , down on her knees before him , there was an arrogant willfulness about her that seemed to lift her above the others . And it was at her Wednesday Evening Circle where she most sorely vexed him . Their prophet and master in the Sunday pulpit , he was nothing at her Evening Circle . There , even that spineless chinless little fool Willie Hall had the presumption to contradict and interrupt him . Abner had counted on his wife Sarah assuming the leadership of the Circle , but once again that wretched woman had proven more burden than blessing to him . He 'd upbraidedher unmercifully for her faithless trepidation , but she only cowered and whimpered and begged that he forgive her . And now tomorrow , the grand and triumphant homecoming for Mr. Giovanni Bruno ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his own people knew him to be mad  --  how could Clara be such an imbecile ? If she could only have seen that silly man , held naked and blubbering while his fellow Romanist Bonali read that poem  --  ! No , she 'd been blinded by her grief , had given in to her selfish whimsy , and only shock and punishment could now bring her once more to the true path . And this was Abner 's task . He cracked his palm with a razor strop , gazed up once more at Peter . There was a knock : he ordered them to enter . Sarah and Francis came first , the others trailing reluctantly . And tomorrow there would be hosannas and dollars strewn like palm branches : the irony of it stuck in Abner 's flesh like cruel barbs . I , too , was saved ! " Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , " he cried aloud , and his family shrunk before him , " and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out ! " Bruno 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national  --  even international  --  focus on the man , why not put it to the whole town 's service ? Already , Bruno had emerged as somethingp142of a town hero , a symbol of the community 's own struggle to survive , so why not make the most of it ? True , as a hero , he was a little short on style maybe , but this town was long accustomed to making do with less than the best . So Cavanaugh had talked to the Rotarians at their regular luncheon meeting , called the Chamber board together , conferred with Mayor Mort Whimple . They 'd set 2 February as the date , since that was the anniversary of the town 's incorporation , even though Doc Lewis had said that might be pushing it a bit . A special statewide relief-fund drive for all the families of miners lost in the disaster had already been launched , and now Whimple had agreed to double the effort , enlarging especially on Bruno 's needs . Ted had got at the Jaycees through an employee at his bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His son Tommy had activated the youngsters at the high school , especially those of Hi-Y , Job 's Daughters , the Lettermen 's Club , and the like . Alderman Joe Altoviti had carried the project for Ted into the Knights of Columbus , Lombard Society , and the Eagles ; Burt Robbins and Jim Elliott had worked on the Elks and the Legion ; and Cavanaugh 's minister Reverend Wesley Edwards had involved the West Condon Ministerial Association . The Catholic priest was , as usual , more grudging , but he agreed to appear on the scene at least . Father Baglione was an old Italian whose loyalty to Rome , as much racial and provincial as organizationaland pious , so outweighed any local considerations that he was really still a foreigner here . Did n't even speak good English . Cavanaughhad been trying for years to get him promoted or some damn thing , get a young American fellow in here in his place . Cavanaugh had also run into some resistance in the least-expected quarter : among Bruno 's fellow Italian coalminers . At first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , slowly , he had come to see that there was a kind of class embarrassment toward Bruno , and a certain amount of scarcely concealed resentment that if only one could have made it , it had to be someone like Giovanni Bruno . Unmarried . Belonged to no clubs , had no friends . Not active at the church . Maybe even a negative attitude there . Standoffish and peculiar . Well , Cavanaugh had made them forget that . He had pushed the idea that in the eyes of the world , Giovanni Bruno represented this generation'svictory over hatred and prejudice , and that they could all stand taller today , not because of who Bruno was personally or what he 'd done , but because of the way others saw him . And , even more important , for the moment  --  no matter how arbitrary it mightp143seem  --  he stood for West Condon , and they all had to help lift West Condon high ! He had written a couple articles more or less to that effect and had planted them in Miller 's newspaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get along with . There was a time when Miller would have written them himself and been all too glad to do it , but something had gone wrong . Tiger was n't panning out . Cavanaugh had thought , back when he first got Miller to come back here , that he 'd get married , settle in for good , become a leader here , mayor for awhile maybe , or even better things . He had a good head , plenty of drive and spirit , and a big following . Should have been a sure thing . Instead , he could n't even make the goddamn paper pay off . Oh , he 'd won a number of meaningless prizes , had sold some articles nationally , had introduced a lot of spectacular though finally pretty silly innovations in the Chronicle , most of which had long since been abandoned , but the paper was losing money , and , what was far more serious , Miller did n't seem to give a damn . Of course , Miller was a spoiled kid , only child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so his ego made it hard for him to blend in . Still given to adolescent just-for-the-hell-of-it storm-raising . His Dad was a mining engineer who was killed accidentally while trying to arbitrate a management-union struggle in the early thirties , a friend of Ted 's Dad , and maybe this had made Tiger grow up with that peculiar fascination for conflict  --  he always said it was what had led him into journalism as a career . Maybe Ted should have thought about all this before he encouraged him to come back and buy up the Chronicle , then loaned him the money to do it . From the day Tiger took that money , they 'd been at odds . And he 'd antagonized his best advertisers with tasteless stories , true or not , had ducked all responsibilities in the community , and had developed an annoying habit of mocking those very customs and traditions that most folks here revered . What was the matter with him ? Maybe it was Jones ' influence . Cavanaugh did n't know where the sonuvabitch had come from , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any day . Jones ' irresponsible anything-goes virus could eat up a community , strike it with a kind of moral encephalitis , and goddamn it , Ted Cavanaugh was n't going to see that happen . Miller 's private life was something less than exemplary , too , and now this latest scandal involving the Cravens widow had finally got Cavanaugh to wondering if Miller might not be best off leaving with Jones on the same train . Miller had a way of always getting his prickp146in the wrong place at the wrong time : Jesus ! when was that guy going to grow up ? It worried Ted , too , that his own son Tommy admired the man so . Came from the old days when young Tiger , as athletic hero and top student , was the town prince , but now Ted was n't sure what lessons Tommy might be learning from the man 's gathering ruin . Still , on this project anyway , Miller had been cooperative enough , had run stories nightly , had done all he could to lure out-of-town  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " East Condon "  --  newsmen to the scene : the hotel was filled up Sunday night and there were even a couple national television cameras on the Bruno front lawn Monday morning . Bunting was up and a welcome sign on the front porch . Inside , neighbor women were giving the house a thorough cleaning . The outside had been freshly painted by high school students . Cheerful day , could n't be better . Ted had seen to it that schools and businesses would be closed for the morning , that the high school band would be on hand , and that the ceremonies would include a number of state dignitaries . Town spirit was the theme . Wes Edwards , for one , had a speech ready that was just the ticket : would call on everyone in earshot to join him in a pledge for community renewal . Edwards was a quiet intellectual guy , tremendousorganizer , good golfer , moving speaker , a sharp cookie . Best they 'd ever got here . Cavanaugh planned to get Bruno and his parents out of the ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl represent the family in front of the cameras . Cute girl , shy but charming , just the right mixture of pride and humility . Before things got under way , Cavanaugh stopped by the hotel , hospital , school , city hall , made sure everything was ready to go . Along the way , he learned whom Tiger Miller had slept with last night . Well , hell , why not ? Might be just the girl he 'd been needing all along . He 'd have to check her out , not a local girl , but she looked good . In fact , at the hospital , where she worked , Cavanaugh looked twice and decided she looked very goddamn good . Lay of the Year at the Municipal Hospital . Inwardly , he grinned a wry grin . That damn Jones is getting to us all , he thought . Vince Bonali woke Monday morning , before dawn , wound up in the sheets , face sweating , eyes wet with tears , breathing like a steamboat . He 'd been down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way through it , smoke , dark , things tripping him upp147bodies ? Oh God ! God Almighty ! The place was all turned around , everybody had bugged out on him , lamps flicking meaninglessly , distantly , sonsabitches would n't listen ! " Hey , you guys ! Goddamn ! " He 'd sidled up somehow , pulled the lights nearer , got them going right . The head , buddy use your goddamn head ! " Both ways ! " he 'd cried , felt like he had to shout . " That way some of us 'll be chosen ! " Jesus ! he had n't meant that , he 'd meant some would get out  --  " Get out ! " He 'd separated them and they 'd headed off . Yet , God , it seemed all wrong ! What the hell was he doing ? Lights blinking down unseen channels , cut off now  --  all gone ! He was alone ! But wait ! He could n't remember which way he 'd meant to go himself ! Knew before , knew one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , Cokie ! Ange ! " Tried to change the scene , knew he 'd done it all before , was n't real , but it only got worse . Then he saw Pooch  --  old Pooch Minicucci ! " Hey , by God ! I thought you 'd bugged out on me , Pooch ! " Jesus , he was glad to see him ! " Come on , man , it 's you and me ! " He 'd get Pooch out now , just tear ass down the  --  but what the  --  ? Jesus Christ ! The dumb bastard was jacking off ! " Oh no ! " Could n't believe it ! " Hey , Pooch ! What are you doing , man ? " The idiot was just squatting there on a heap of gob , eyes blank like mica , prick long as a damn timber , pulling himselfoff ! " The old snake ! " roared Ange Moroni in the washhouse , big laughter booming out , and Vince laughed , everybody was laughing , and for a minute he was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he could talk plain ! " Jesus , that was funny ! Good old Ange but no ! There he was still : " Pooch ! " Pooch 's jaw went slack , twitched like he wanted to talk only could n't .

Never saw it stiff like that before , could n't even see the end of it , seemed to reach right up to the  --  " Pooch ! I ai n't gon na say it one more time ! If you do n't come , man , it 's your own goddamn fault ! " Jesus ! Maybe he 'd loosen it all , bring the whole fucking mine down ! Noise of topcoal splitting , some fell somewhere . Distant screams . Vince was running , trying to run , a shifting under his feet , hollow echoing emptiness , ears ached , hard to breathe , air thick as cotton  --  gas ! Gas ! Do n't think about it , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see the timbers , machines , could n't see a goddamn thing . But did n't bump into anything , going like ninety , but somehow nothing got in the way . Felt stuff brushing by , tight spots here and there , pushed , turned , faked , okay , okay , buddy , racing to beat hell , just a  --  hot ! hot as hell ! smoke ! what 's that ? a glow ! glow ahead ! fire ! Wrong way , oh my God ! he 'd been running the wrong goddamn way !  |p148No  ! No ! Coming , it 's coming ! tried to turn back . Could n't turn back . Heat ! Done for ! Done for ! Turn ! Turn , goddamn it ! But hard , hard to get , to get swung around . He struggled . Things in his way now . Legs heavy , tired . Goddamn tired . It was too much for one man . At his back now . Done for . Legs flabby . Out of shape . Too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft clay . Trapped ! Clawed his way into it . Air gone . Get through ! Choked . " It 's okay , " Etta said . Vince unwound himself , still choked up , wiped his face with the sheet . " I 'm sorry Pooch died , " he said hoarsely . " Sure , " said Etta . " Etta ? " Alongside him , her big hind end turned toward him , his wife grunted . " Etta , I ai n't never going back down there again . " And then he was able to sleep . Slept like a log . When he finally did wake up , Etta already had breakfast ready for him . Over his eggs , trying to remember his dream , he asked , " Where 's the kids ? Angie off to school already ? " " No school today , " Etta reminded him . " Both she and Charlie were up early . I think they were going over to Tony and Emilia Bruno 's house . Their boy is coming home from the hospital today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right . That 's today , " Vince said . " Think I 'll drop over there too . They 're shelling out a lotta dough and maybe they 'll have some left over . " Etta took that crack in grim silence . She was down to just about nothing in her grocery budget . But , by God , things would be different now . Once he 'd got him a good job , never mind what , just so it was n't coalmining , they 'd never have to fret these long layoffs again . He felt strong , left with his shoulders squared . Townsfolk had already massed up on the Bruno front lawn when Vince arrived . Bright sun , though the day was crisp , holiday air . Shops , school , everything closed . Vince moved around , talking with old buddies , joking about Bruno . Still , there was nothing sour about it , and everybody was feeling good . Mort Whimple , the mayor , arrived in a new black Chrysler , accompanied by Father Baglione , some state politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollied around on the sidewalk , shooting everybody . Jesus , the crowd was really big ! Officials from the Red Cross , the UMW , the coal company , members of the city council , and representatives from other civic or/ganizations pulled up behind the Chrysler . Vince said hello to his alderman Joe Altoviti , and they kidded around a little . A sign on the mayor 's car said : GIOVANNI BRUNO  --  WEST CONDON SAYS  --  GET WELL SOON ! ! ! Everybody cheered as Whimple , in his trademark tweeds and sportshirt buttoned at the neck , moved among them , flanked by the congressmen , the whole group smiling toothily in all directions . Whimple was a homely little guy , used to be fire chief , and before that a car salesman . Vince found himself with a big smile splitting his own face . A piece of the high school band arrived , tooted a bunch of marches on the lawn . Lot of excitement . Well , in spite of everything , by God , it was a great goddamntown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew shouts from the crowds . The band broke off , then started up again . The dignitaries , with selfconsciousshrugs and private jokes nobody could hear , arranged themselves on the front porch , while the cops , Dee Romano , Monk Wallace , and old Willie , cleared the sidewalk . Vince helped . He felt a part of it . The sun shown bright and here in the crowd there was a warmth . A couple ladies appeared at the storm door , noses pressed on the panes , neighbor women . Probably had got the house ready . The band played " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow . " Vince saw Georgie Lucci 's face grinning at him , and he grinned back . Everybody was grinning . The siren was getting louder . All necks craned toward the siren now . It was like a distant cry of good cheer , yet an anxious one , too  --  always something of terror and the unexpected in the pitch of an ambulance siren . Then it swung up , bright white . The music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of enthusiasm . They brought Bruno out on a stretcher . Poor guy looked scared to death . Television cameras were grinding away . Vince saw Tiger Miller , the Chronicle editor , popping photos along with all the other newsguys , gave him the nod when he chanced to glance his way . Vince had not been too hot on this big show for Bruno , but Miller in his paper had made it seem almost reasonable . Bruno 's family , his folks and his kid sister , walked beside the stretcher . Vince had n't seen old Tony in years and he was shocked by what he saw . Trembling , a sickly white , nearly blind old man with a bandaged nose . Had to be helped along . And he used to be such a tough hard-fisted bastard . What was worse , the poor old guy had wet his pants . It was embarrassing , but people overlooked it . Tony 's wife was small and wizened , looked now like a lot of old ladies who had lived on too long.  |p150The  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big ceremonies . She did a good job of it . And Vince thought , If everybody in the goddamn country is going to be looking at West Condon , it 's sure a helluva lot better to have her up there than her brother . He realized he still was n't too happy about its being Bruno . The speeches were full of praise for West Condon 's great community spirit and its stamina . Whimple , the congressmen , Ted Cavanaugh , the preacher , everybody scored the same theme . The band played the high school fighting song . Vince remembered with pride those team huddles , back when Ted Cavanaugh captained the squad and ran his famous offtackle plays over Vince , remembered the slaps , the spirit , the power , how they spat water and dug in their cleats and pounded away . Jesus , it 's a great place ! he thought , and he knew then he was right in getting out of the mine , right in coming topside to play a real part , knew by God he 'd make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not wanting to go home and lose this thing , Vince ran into Barney Davis , the mine manager . Barney asked him if he 'd mind delivering the charity drive checks to Cravens ' widow and Minicucci 's folks . Vince said okay , make a nice farewell gesture . " What do you mean , farewell ? " Davis asked . " I 'm getting out . " " What ? You mean you 're quitting the mines ? " Davis laughed . " Shit , Bonali , it gets in the blood . You ca n't quit easy as that . " " Yeah ? Well , watch and see , Davis . " Davis laughed again . " I 'll believe it when I see it in the Chronicle , " he said . Once a day , six days a week and sometimes seven , year in , year out , the affairs of West Condon were compressed into a set of conventionally accepted signs and became , in the shape of the West Condon Chronicle , what most folks in town thought of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damp , aromatic pouch , it fluttered onto porches nightly , was gathered in by the several citi/zens to easy chairs and kitchen tables , there to open its petals like the proverbial lotus , providing , if not exactly wisdom , at least plenty to talk about and maybe a laugh or two . That its publisher and editor , Justin Miller , sometimes thought of himself as in the entertainment business and viewed his product , based as it was on the technicality of the recordable fact , as a kind of benevolent hoax , probably only helped to make the paper greater , for it was certainly true that although the Chronicle was as old as West Condon and as much father of the town as child of it , it was only when Tiger came home to take it over that it became a real institution . Miller himself was something of a local institution even before that , having been the greatest athlete to pass through West Condon High School . Small towns like West Condon seldom reached the state basketball finals , but Miller had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Golden Age to the town 's middle-aged and old-timers , a legend for the young : number 14 : jersey retired . He had , meanwhile , captained both the track and baseball teams , edited the school paper , presided over his class twice , made mostly A 's , and , surprising no one , vanished from the premises immediately after graduation . Nobody asked why he left : anybody with any sense did . So , his extraordinary decision to return a few years later , giving up his freewheeling life as a correspondent in order to resuscitate the defunct Chronicle , had come like a breath of new life : hey ! Tiger 's back in town ! things are moving again ! And there were prodigies : the highway was widened by the state , two mines resumed operations awhile , and a new factory making plastictoys was established on the outskirts , though this operation later folded . The newspaper , of course , was great , if Tiger had anything to do with it it had to be great , won a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The basketball team won the conference title and Tiger started up his semipro baseball club , never had a losing season . And whenever the town fell into the dumps , people looked to the Chronicle , counted on Tiger to pull them out , and he usually did . So now their communal eye was on the Chronicle again . Deepwater No. 9 , last mine in the area to keep operating , was closed since the disaster , and rumor was , it was going to stay that way . No new industry , business was poor , and people were moving out again . Hard winter . But was Tiger still with them ? Most folks thought so , but there were bad signs . Rumor was that the paper was losing money , and Miller did n't seem to care . Some of the Rotary Club meetings had been treated pretty unpleasantly , punch lines left out of speeches ,  |p152names  misspelled , that kind of thing . The traditional Christmas spirit had got knocked , too , when Miller started running parodies of the best-loved Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Some said , that 's the trouble with Miller , he keeps going soft just when you expect the best of him . A lot of jump , but not much of a miler . It was still a matter of town curiosity that Miller had led the basketball team to State his sophomore and junior years , but had been unable to get them past the regionals his senior year . Some said he was screwing around too much that year ; others thought they saw " some spark go out of him , " as though he 'd become just plain bored ; others blamed the coach . And that was why , while most people saw his return to take over the Chronicle as a heroic kind of yea-saying , if not indeed an act of grace , there were those , even then , who wondered if Tiger might not simply have run out of wind out there in the world and returned to rest up awhile in a place where heroism was still possible without sticking to training rules . And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play to the spookier side of the Bruno rescue and all those peculiar little squibs about religious eccentrics ? Miller was a skeptic , did n't go to church , everybody knew that : so why this sudden interest in so-called miracles and visions ? When Reverend Wesley Edwards first came to town to take over the Presbyterian pulpit he had , prodded by some of his elders , sought to reactivate Miller 's interest in the church . Miller 's skepticism had n't bothered him , he was a skeptic in most ways himself , and in fact he 'd got a kick out of arguing with that romanticrationalist . But there was no getting him back to church . Millerwas an atheist , and a fundamentalist to boot , who could n't see past the end of his own flesh-and-bone nose , to put it politely . And then Miller had started throwing some of his own remarks back at him , and Edwards had realized he 'd compromised himself in the course of their talks . So one day he had just taken the pipe out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God , surrender to His will . " Miller had snorted , and that had been the end of it . Then , on this otherwise calm sixth of February , a Friday when church news was customarily printed , there appeared , right on the front page in a small neat box , a paragraph which announced that the Evening Circle of the West Condon Church of the Nazarene would convene on Sunday evening at the home of Mr. Giovanni Bruno . " All interested townsfolk are invited to attend this very importantmeeting . " Edwards smarted . Nothing the Presbyterians had ever done had made the front page , not even his own election to thep153chairmanship of the Ministerial Association . What was Miller up to ? Edwards sensed it : it 's me he 's after . Actually , Miller had toned the story , giving Mrs. Clara Collins much less than she 'd asked for , a bare announcement where she 'd wanted a screaming banner . He 'd just come back from Mick 's and his daily late-afternoon ration of hamburger-ash and beer the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , regaling the boys with horror stories from the history of coalmining . Jones had a knack . He 'd turned a grisly tale of management goons working over a hapless unionizer into a goddamn song-and-dance act that had had the whole klatch laughing and crying at the same time . Miller did n't know much about Jones , he 'd just turned up one day announcing he 'd decided to seek his fortune with the West Comedown Comical . Miller had laughed and taken him on . There had been some hint of a job as an all-night disk jockey that he 'd just involuntarily surrendered ( " Obscenity was the uncouth charge , " Jones had said ) , but on the other hand that might have been several jobs back . Jones was , in brief , a complacent drifter , gifted with an uncommonly facile feedbacksystem , making his way any way he could , keeping a perverse eye out and telling good stories about what he saw . Miller was glad to have him , and though his humor sometimes had a way of biting too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not only wanted more attention for her announcement , she 'd wanted Miller to attend the Sunday night meeting . She 'd jumped up when he entered , nearly knocking the chair over . Her purse had swung , sweeping a stack of copypaper to the floor . " I do n't mean to trouble ye , Mr. Miller , I only stopped by a minute  --  " " No trouble , Mrs. Collins . Good to see you . " He 'd picked up the copypaper , tossed it carelessly on the desk . " Sit down . " He 'd hung up his coat , dropped into his swivel chair , pulled out his pack of cigarettes , but , catching her look , had tossed them on his desk without lighting one . The beer , as usual , had made him drowsy . She 'd sat awkwardly beside his desk , knobby knees apart , had glanced around nervously at a restless activity she was ignorant of . " We 're all meetin ' Sunday over to Mr. Bruno 's house , " she had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honored ifn you could see fit to come . " " That 's very kind , Mrs. Collins . " He 'd suppressed a yawn , reached again for the pack , stopped himself . " But I 'm afraid I 'm tied up . Is there some special reason  --  ? " " Well , that 's jist it , Mr. Miller . " She 'd straightened up , smoothingp154the plain print dress out over her broad thighs . He 'd known of course what was coming . " Sunday 's the eighth of the month . Mebbe . . . mebbe it 's the end a the world ! " " Oh yes . Your husband 's note . " So she 'd explained again about that , had told him what had been happening at Evening Circle . He 'd heard the pressman Carl Schwartz ' voice out front saying good night to Annie  --  like Lou , he called her Anus Poopa  --  and it had set him to thinking of Carl 's disaster story , the assault on Dinah Clemens . Miller could still picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went there . Aqua-blue with pink and white lily pads , the walls ; bed an old iron antique , lumpy mattress , a single sheet stretched tautly on it . Dinah had a certain sense of order . There were pillows and blankets in the wardrobe , which she 'd got out later . It had been Ox 's idea . " Willie Hall ? That 's the fellow who used to be Oxford Clemens ' buddy at the mine , is n't it ? " She 'd said it was , talked about Willie and his wife Mabel , Oxford 's late foster mother Marge Clark . Miller , watching Clara , had realized she had something in common with Dinah  --  not just the rawboned hillbilly part , but something attractive , too . Also had realized he was getting a hard-on . " It was Willie 's idea , Mr. Miller , " she 'd said , " to meet at Mr. Bruno 's . " " Why this Sunday , Clara , and not some other month ? " Why had he called her by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well along in years , tough reddish hands , not his type at all , and yet there was this throb between his legs . Maybe it was just the beer . She 'd told him why she was counting on February , but he could see she was troubled , not all that confident . He had listened to her voice , hearing Dinah Clemens . They 'd gone the night they won the regionals . Five green guys ages fifteen to seventeen , Miller the youngest . Ox had taken them in the back door so they would n't have to face any of the old guys in the bar who might recognize them . Ox had kept insisting that Tiger go with the one called Dinah . It was the one thing Ox had been set on , and Miller had n't seen the point in arguing . He 'd assumed Ox Clemens knew better than anyone which one was best , and if it was all some kind of gag , well , hell , he did n't have to go through with it . That in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually an act of consecration , Miller had n't found out until they were climbing the back steps to her room , the girl telling him she 'd heard so much about him from her brother . " And then Ip155read about that there shepherd boy , Mr. Miller , " Clara had said , " and it all seemed to fit . " " And you talked with  --  ? " He 'd realized then that he had a cigarettebetween his lips . What the hell . He 'd lit up . " I went by right after the meeting and asked , and his sister she said , sure , come along , we 'll be expectin ' you . Y'know , Mr. Miller , I think Mr. Bruno he already knows ! " " It 's possible . " When he 'd glanced at the large shadowy space betweenher knobby knees , he 'd been repulsed by a sense of a-sexuality there , yet the erection had kept drumming away . What was it ? Was it plain sincerity that was exciting him ? Or only the provocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dinah had hung her few clothes in the old wardrobe that leaned up against one aqua-blue corner , had frocked her strong freckled shoulders with a pink robe . Miller had looked at Clara 's shoulders : yes , she almost certainly had freckles there . " Will Abner Baxter be there ? " Clara had slumped a little , relaxing some of that raw aggressiveness , her taut belly briefly softening . " I du n no , Mr. Miller . I hope so . " " Is he a real minister , or  --  ? " And she 'd commenced to tell him about how one gets the call and gives testimony of it to the local church board , and he 'd kept hearing Dinah telling a young kid who was asking all the wrong questions how a girl got to be a whore , and the difference between local preachers , district ministers , and elders . Her voice had had a husky soothing quality , all the harsh sounds of the words rounded off ; it was rustic nasal from the mountains , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kindness and earnestness in it were all her own . She 'd rubbed his chest and abdomen . " You 're a good boy with my brother . I 'm much obliged . " " So Baxter still has to wait a year ? " " That 's right . " Clara had seemed confused . Her hands had pressed nervously on her thighs . Of course , if you thought the world was ending , what sense did it make to talk about next year ? " Well , all we kin do , Mr. Miller , is hope for the best . " Miller had swung around to his old Underwood , had run copypaperin , and had rapped out the one-paragraph box about her proposedmeeting . " I can put that on the front page for you . " " But do ye think it 's . . . enough ? " He 'd felt a shrinking . " Any more than that , Mrs. Collins , and I 'm afraid you 'll get a lot of people you do n't want . "  |p156That  had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dinah , trying again , but she 'd finally agreed it was the best . When she 'd left , Miller had called Happy Bottom at the hospital and , holding on , had made a date . Off at nine . They 'd have sandwiches somewhere , spend the night at his place . At home later , he 'd just undressed to shower when the phone rang . It was Marcella , calling to tell him of the planned Sunday night meeting , and repeating Clara 's invitation to come . Her soft Catholic voice was something else : instead of cornfields , terraced gardens , secret and undiscovered . Yes , he thought , but no , the Nazarenes were too much for him , Baxter especially , that was a pose he could never fake . So he again refused but pretended great interest , and asked her to tell him afterwards all that happened . Hanging up , the phone cord snaked momentarily around what Happy called his gaff  --  already starting to dance at the sound of Marcella 's voice and the vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail flipping  --  then slipped off , just a touch , a taunt , just enough to bring his entire attention to bear briefly on that obstreperousmachine , filament and didymous anther , feel himself that instant only an extension of the mechanism , accouterments of defense and motion : sperm carrier . It was n't sex that whipped him , whipped them all , it was the spook behind sex , that thing that designed him , reshaped him , waked him , churned him , thought for him even : Jesus , when was the last time he 'd committed a wholly rational act ! He felt the engine drive his legs to the bath , hoist him over the edge , felt his balls sensitizing his fingertips as he turned on the water , his prick reach for the soap , heard the tubes boil and sigh as the hot water struck and soothed . Wesley Edwards had once chided him for his " romantic attachment to rationalism . " Rationalism indeed ! Christ ! Old Edwards would laugh his ass off if he knew ! " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alias the Kitten , known in the bleachers and back seats as " the boy with the paws that refresh , " youngest son of the town banker , start/ing forward on the basketball team and class officer , owner at sixteenof his own set of wheels , " would n't hurt people . " Reverend Edwards argued that while God was surely just and benevolent , He was still capable of righteous punishment , and that sometimes when a man thought he was being hurt , he later found out it had been for his own benefit , as when a father chastises his son , for example , or when a coach makes you go to bed early at night . Everybody snickered at that , since it was already out in closed circlesthat Tommy had the very night before broken training rules to take Sally Elliott out parking at the iceplant . Bushwhackers had come on a scene of some disarray , the implications of which Tommy had not , though perhaps he should have , denied . " God is good , " said the minister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but sometimes He makes us to suffer experiences we might rather avoid . Remember the stories of Adam and Joseph , of Abraham and Noah . Remember that , as good as God is , this is a God Who could say to Noah , I have determined to make an end of all flesh , for the earth is  --  ' " " I ca n't believe all those stories , " said Tommy flatly . He looked around at the class and saw that they were with him . Usually Mr. Robbins or Sally 's Dad taught their Sunday school group , and then they talked sports . Reverend Edwards was an aggravation . For Tommy , though God was a distant elusive substance difficult to envision , He was nonetheless guardian of what was good in human affairs , a kind of president , as it were . " Anyway , you said we were n't supposed to take them literally . " " No , that 's right , but I did n't mean you were to ignore them altogethereither . Just reflect , fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how He promises a terrible judgment upon those who turn away from Him . " Tommy knew nothing of terrible judgments . He knew that God was generally satisfied with a token pledge of allegiance once a week , a more or less solemn pause to consider the moral virtues , and that anything more than that would suppose a pride in God only imaginablein men . He supposed that some day , after a happy life on this earth , he would pass an even happier eternity in God 's country , a place spatially distant but not entirely unlike West Condon . " All I 'm saying is that I think if God wants us to believe in Him , He makes us believe , and if He wants us to do something , He knows how to get the job done without a lot of faking around . A coach is just a man ,  |p158you  know , he may be a pretty smart man , but he 's just a man , he does n't know everything , but God is , well , God is God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggled and wheezed . " That 's right , Tommy , but sometimes God may think that you learn a lesson better if you learn it by yourself . As the Bible says , For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant , but later it yields  --  ' " " But why ? " demanded Tommy , getting exasperated . " Has God got control over things , or has n't He ? You know , if He has to pass signals to me by blowing up a mine and killing a hundred guys almost and then not bother to tell me why , well , He is n't even much of a coach ! " " Well now , let 's not be impertinent , " scolded Reverend Edwards , no longer smiling , chewing on his lip like he always did when he got bothered . " As for all that seems evil in this world , you 're forgetting about the devil and  --  " " That 's the other team , " interrupted Tommy . " I do n't play for them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggled without being able to hold back . Reverend Edwards looked at his watch . " Well , fellows , I thing it 's about time . . . " " One thing 's been bothering me , though , Reverend , " said Tommy , " and that 's about sin . " " Well now , " said Reverend Edwards with a sly class-is-over smile , " have you been sinning , Tommy ? " Everybody laughed . Tommy grinned , accepting the laughter as praise , having in fact set himself up for it . " What I mean is , if God knows everything , even before it happens , and has all that say-so over everything we do , well , if we sin , it must be because He wants us to sin , and if He wants us to sin , then how is it sin ? " He paused , a little breathless . " If you see what I mean . " " Yes , I do , Tommy , though I 'm afraid it gets us into the doctrine of predestination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I doubt we can cover all of that in the two or three minutes we have left . But let me say that , as Presbyterians , we do not believe that man is without free will . Perhaps , Tommy , God in His infinite wisdom has granted man the one freedom to turn away from Him , and that this is what is really meant by sin . " " Oh yeah ? Well , why would He want to do that ? " Tommy asked , and when the minister showed no signs of answering , added , " I do n't know , I ca n't see giving up something you already got or playingp159spooky games like that with people who are too stupid to know what 's going on . If it 's all so indefinite and weird and shaky like you say , well , that 's a pretty scary idea . " " I think God is a pretty scary idea , " said Reverend Edwards softly , and he smiled . The bell rang and they all went outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to horse around ten or fifteen minutes before they had to go to church . " Comin ' at you , Kit ! " Tommy pivoted to receive the morning 's church program , waddedinto a loose ball , as the guy who had pitched it made a hoop behind his back with his arms and faded like a football end . Tommy the Kitten mock-dribbled , wheeled , cupping the paper ball in the broad long-fingered hand that was his on-the-courts trademark , and hooked it gracefully through the receding hoop , bouncing it off the guy 's butt below . " Hole in one , Kit baby ! " " Well , a hole in one is better than no hole at all , " Tommy gagged and they howled with laughter . Old standby of his Dad 's . His father was , in fact , at that very moment on the other side of the church lawn surrounded by the older guys . They were laughing and that meant his Dad had a new story . His Dad was a great storyteller , if not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrilegious joke , and he never told a story that made fun of West Condon . Those two things went together for his Dad : the community was sacred and religion was there to keep it so . For Tommy , both were pretty boring and restrictive , but he did n't really mind either . If you really had to , there were ways of getting around both . The ice plant , for example , was outside the city limits . His Dad , he thought , had a few pretty oldfashionedideas , but everybody 's Dad did . For one thing , he would always lecture Tommy that although property was in itself a kind of virtue , it carried with it an equal responsibility , and Tommy could never get it out of his mind that he would have the property , whether he was responsible or not . " Hey , you seen Kit 's girl ? She 's a real dog ! " " Whaddaya mean , man ? " " Have n't you seen how she drops her pants whenever she sees his bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told him was that the girls would only come to him as clean as he went to them , and he had found out that this was n't exactly true either . That little Elliott girl , for example , asp160far as she knew from the way everybody joked around about him , he was over in Waterton or had somebody in his back seat every night and had syphilis and everything else from so much sex , and yet there she was , letting him drive her right out to the ice plant last night , popping into the back seat with him , and , my gosh , not knowinganything about anything , just letting him do what he wanted to do , a complete dumb cherry , though really kind of nice , and only if he had known what to do , known for sure , why , he could have made her right then and there . Even as it was , they had had a pretty hot time , but finally he got a little scared . He was afraid of making a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like going out with a girl unless he could like her well enough to marry her , and if he liked her then he did n't want to hurt her any way . Of course , Sally Elliott came from a good family , her Dad being the Chamber of Commerce secretary and all , so even if something did happen it could n't be too horrible . Yes , he was a darned kitten , all right , and the more he thought about it , the more it made him mad . Boy , Tiger Miller would n't wait around  --  you got ta grow up , man ! " Hey , Kit ! What 's worse than your old man with a jag on ? " Tommy thought . " I do n't know . Your girl with a rag on ? " " Naw ! " the guy howled through the laughter . " Your old ladywith a jig on ! " Tommy laughed with the others , but he did n't like the joke . He was sensitive about " old lady " jokes ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had really made his Dad sore , because he thought at first Tiger Miller had done it on purpose , and here he had been the one who had brought him back to West Condon in the first place and then to pull a rotten trick like that . Tommy had been badly upset by the event , since three of the peoplehe loved the most were involved , but finally it turned out that Tiger probably was n't at fault . Actually , though none of his buddies knew it now , Tommy had received his nickname upon Tiger Miller 's return to the town . He was about eleven or so when Tiger came home , and everybody said then that Tommy was going to be just like him , and they started calling him Tiger 's Kitten . Now it was plain Kit , and when anyone asked , he would say it was the girls who had started calling him Kit Carson , the Irrepressible Explorer . After graduation , he looked forward to playing on Tiger 's baseball team in the area semipro league . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still the best first baseman in the league and a regular .400 hitter . Tommy wasp161glad he had learned to play shortstop , because they would have a chance to play together . Tommy noticed Sally Elliott over by the vacated Sunday school building , staring over his way . " Excuse me , men , " he said , catching the wadded program and flipping it back into the guy 's crotch , " but my services are in demand . " " Hey , Kit , " one guy whispered , " you getting some of that ? " " Well , uh , let 's say I 'm looking into it . " He strolled out of their laughter and over toward the girl . Wow , just seeing her standing there so awkward heated him up  --  he hoped it was n't going to show . Man , it had to happen soon ! And she was so nice , there was something really soft and great about her . If only she had known the score , and he  --  well , he knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor bastards with their nobody fathers . Man , they could do it in full public and it would n't matter . Charlie Bonali , making laborious toilet , listened to his old man in the living room bitching and moaning about his bad luck . Well , he was a goddamn failure and he would n't admit it . Just about everybodyCharlie knew was a failure and that was the goddamn truth , a bunch of saps . Everywhere he looked , nothing but saps . And his old lady was even worse , trying to drag him off to Mass and yap-yappingabout the horrors of hell . Charlie had skipped Mass this morning and had had to take a lot of guff off her and he was still sore about it . Man ! he 'd sure got dropped by a pair of squares ! Showered and shampooed , Charlie stood naked in the bathroom , rolling on deodorant and applying cologne . He cocked his dark brow and curled his thick lip down . " You handsome fucker ! " he said and flashed a white toothy smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing again . Saps . God , the place was rotten to the core ! Pray , pay , and get blown to hell . Jesus , when would they ever learn ? Take the disaster . Okay , so his old man got out , but what the hell was he doing down there in the first place ? And old Ange . There was a smart one . Thousand laughs , punch in the ribs , knew all the answers . Now he rots , burned black to the bone . Smart , very smart . And now what was Charlie 's old lady saying ? That Uncle Ange was lucky : he 'd been to confession the Sunday before . Charlie nearly laughed out loud . He could hear old Ange himself say it , it was Ange 's favorite line : " Lucky , my lily-white ass ! " It was hard to figure . A dumb guyp162gets nailed up on a goddamn cross , and they all think that 's so great , they want to get up there and hang with him . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie Bonali was not going to stand in ! He did n't even know if he could stomach another Easter season around this dump . He had cleaned his fingernails and toenailswith a brush in the bath , and now trimmed them with a clipper . He had one foot up on the stool , his bare ass to the door , when his kid sister Angie knocked . " Are n't you out of there yet ? " she demanded . " You 're worse than a girl ! " " Come on ahead , if you 're in such a hurry , " he shouted back . He hoped to hell she would , she 'd shut up then , and he stood a little straighter just in case she did . " Not with you in there ! " she huffed and went away . He sighed , put his foot down , filed his fingernails . The old man was howling about all his hard work in the mines having brought him to nothing but a big fat dead end , a favorite crybaby routine of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The old man was very hot on justice and injustice , and thought a man should get what he worked for . Jesus God , he was dumb . Charlie fingered tonic into his wavy black hair , devoted ten carefulminutes to a strand-by-strand arrangement of it . Damn hairline was edging back , he was sure of it . Work , my Jesus . Well , Charlie could tell the old man things . If a punk weighed in at a hundred pounds , could he play tackle on a varsity team ? Hell , no ! And take it from a big man . Some guys had it , some did n't . So much for justice , old man . Now , the guys that had it , the smart guys , how did they get it ? By being tough . None of your bellyaching about justice , man . If the other guy was born dumb or weak or sick or poor or old or unlucky , well , fuck him . Make him work for you , make him kiss your ass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his meaty shoulders , smashed his fist into his palm . Yeah , man . Snapped his fingers , the old sign for action . He brushed his teeth , leaning up against the lavatory . The sleek pressure of the cold enamel delighted his rod and groin . As he looked down to spit , though , he saw that his belly ballooned out over the lip of the sink . Goddamn beergut , he was going to pot . He stared glumly at that pale bag , shaggily coated with curly black hair . Anothersign of the bad times . All he did now was drink beer and sometimespick up some middle-age stuff in one of the joints . They had to know a lot of tricks or he could n't even pop off , he was so depressed  |p163He  had to get out of here . Nearly all his buddies who graduated with him last year were gone now , and the ones who 'd stayed were in worse shape than he was . The new high school kids looked like little babies , like that bitchy little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted scared of him . Jesus , he was looking like an old man , that 's what . He sucked in his gut and whacked it hard with the butt of his hand . Have to toughen up , goddamn it ! He whacked it a couple more times , then looked away irritably as it sagged again . He pulled on his clean T-shirt and repeated the ritual of the comb . Couple of his buddies had joined the Marines . Shit , that sounded pretty stupid , but maybe he ought to , too . Something to tide him over until he found his way to the top . If he hung around here any longer he was going to go off his nut . By God , why not ? He 'd do it , he 'd join the goddamn Marines and get away from his old man and his old lady , away from the bitching and nagging and away from the mines and West Condon and God and all his fucking paraphernalia . He flashed the smile . Yeah , man . Then , reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the wicked , laying him bare from thigh to neck . . . One difference between Nathan Baxter and his father , now the Reverend Abner Baxter of the Church of the Nazarene , was that while his father believed in the eventual redistribution of all property equally to all people ( or anyway all saints ) , no matter how it had to be accomplished , and as Jesus Christ , he preached , had intended , Nat Baxter recognized no property rights at all . " Whatever the eye sees and covets , let the hand grasp it . " At the high school gymnasiumthe Sunday of the mine disaster , Nat 's eye saw and coveted a beautifully gnarled black hand that lay , carbonized and unattached , among the bodies and other refuse , and , covertly , his hand grasped it , stuffed it in a paper sack . For a long time before , he and his little brother Paulie had played Batman and Robin , flying dangerously through the trees , destroyingwild beasts , and doing God 's will amongst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , of course , and sometimes , to keep the game going , Robin himself had to display a streak of perversity , so he could be dealt with by the hard arm of the law , but there were usually some little kids in the neighborhood they could catchp164and tie up and bring to proper retribution . Or , if not , they could almost always talk their sister Amanda into it . She was ten and bigger than Paulie , but so weak that Paulie  --  Robin , that is  --  could usually catch her and pin her down by himself . The trouble was , she sometimestattled , but that only added danger to their game , and whenever she did , she always knew she would get it double next time . Paulie had grown a little too smart , though , about playing Robin ; he seemed to consider that it was even better than being Batman . So one day , as a lesson , Nat had shot a real robin with his beebee gun and had made Paulie watch it die . " Me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . " You , Robin . " The bird was still blinking its heavy gray lids , but it had stopped trying to fly . As Paulie , scared , squatted down close to see where the bird had been hit , Nat had placed his foot on the bird 's head and slowly crunched its skull in . That had stopped Paulie being cocky about the part he played , but also it had almost stopped the game altogether . Paulie was too big a baby all the time . But finding the hand had solved all that . That Sunday , when he came home , he put on his sweatshirt , and pulling his left hand up into the sleeve , carefully fitted the left cuff around the wrist of the dead hand , holding it inside by the bone that stuck out . He left a note where Paulie would be sure to see it : Beware the Black Hand ! and then waited until he had him alone in the bedroom to spring it on him . Paulie screamed and nearly fell into a frothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice in imitation of their father 's , he warned Paulie to keep quiet about it ; if he said anything to anybody , the Black Hand would get him . When , later that evening , Paulie got his peter whopped by their father 's razor strop , Nat told him it was God 's punishment because he had acted so scared he had almost given it all away . But , Nat said , he had proven himself , and now he could be the assistant to the Black Hand . What did he want to call himself ? Paul suggested the Black Finger , but Nat rejected the idea : if they painted it black with ink , everybody would see it and ask about it . Paulie said , what about the Black Peter ? That was where God had hit him , and you could n't see that . Nat agreed , provided Paulie would promise to be careful and wash it off every time before their mother gave them their baths . So , after that , the Black Hand and the Black Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than being Batman and Robin , because now they were on the other side , and they could do whatever they wanted to . They stole and put poop on porches andp165tortured victims and broke bottles and burned birds they shot in gasolineand one night they strangled Widow Harlowe 's cat . With ink , Nat drew pictures of the black hand on little pieces of paper , which they left behind whenever they completed a really good job . They began making plans for initiating Amanda , but their father was home almost all the time now , what with the mine closed and the sermons he was always having to prepare , and they were afraid about her tattling . She was their father 's favorite , and he could get pretty rough if he thought she was being victimized . But then , one Sunday night early in February when he 'd had the hand just about a month , both their parents had to attend some important church meeting called by Widow Collins in some man 's house , a wop man named Mr. Bruno , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that his father did not like Widow Collins anymore , so he put her on the list for future visitations . Once their parents had left , their big brother Junior wandered off to town to play the pinball machines , and then one of Franny 's girlfriends came by and they went for a walk , so Paul and Nathan had Amanda to themselves . An opportunity like that could not be passed by . Pitilessly , the Black Hand and the Black Peter struck . A month of anguish and ordeal . A month of hope . Oh , the upward straining ! Oh , the despair of nonfulfillment ! Rarely had conviction so wholly failed her . Struck down , Clara Collins wept . Hardship afflicted though her life had been , always there had been something , or someone , to comfort her , to guard her from grief 's last defeat . Always in crisis  --  even at the worst a month ago when Ely got killed , and earlier when Harold died in the war  --  she had discovered , through her enduring faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new inner rivers of resolve . But now , in this strange house , in inexplicable legion with these strange persons , at this strange and empty hour  --  emptier than she had ever conceived an hour could be  --  of midnight , the midnight that cleft the eighth of the month of February from the new ninth , as Abner Baxter hurled his implacablep166curses and all her friends walked out on her , Clara suffered a total collapse of strength . Everything just dropped out . Even faith failed her . She could not pray . It was as though they had walked out taking her very spirit with them , and now the hollow shell of her could but sit , utterly powerless and forsaken , in this bewilderingly darkened Italian living room lit only by its irreverent television  --  sit whimperinglike a lost child . The hour had been striking still as she followed them out of Giovanni Bruno 's bedroom , through the dining room with its alien pungency , into the shrouded blink and rasp of the living room where the old father sat , foul-smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed them , held by a mere thread to the edge of the awful cliff , to the very door . Out they had marched , indignant , inflexible , even as though frightened , the Baxters and the Coates , all those people , the widows Lawson and Harlowe , the Willie Halls and Calvin Smiths , the Grays , Gideon Diggs , everybody , all the friends of the faith she had known and so devotedly served , even her truest friend Betty Wilson . Out ! If only one could have  --  " Please ! " she had whispered desperately to Betty , and Betty , crying shamelessly , had begged her forgiveness , then left with the others . The thread parted . She dropped , head spinning . Nearby : a sofa . It received her . There she wept . And the worst of it was : she no longer felt Ely 's presence . Throughout this month of terror and trial , he had stayed by her side , had seemed closer even than he had been while living , had guided her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . . . and now he was gone . Gone ! Ely ! How ? How had it come to pass ? " Puffed up with conceit ! " Abner Baxter had cried , passing through the door . Oh no , dear God , it was not so ! So utterly , so frankly and wholeheartedly , had she believed that the portentous thing was truly happening , that now it was as though it had happened and had left her behind , behind in the strangescentedemptiness with its blue flickering light and tinkling hollow voices . She had not doubted , no , indeed all her life had seemed to come to bear on this moment , all good Ely had taught her , and all the signs this month  --  especially his suffering  --  had insisted upon it . " For our light affliction , which is for the moment only , worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory , because we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen ! " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message and the appearances to both him and his companion Giovanni Brunop167of the mysterious white bird , then the startling coincidence of the story that appeared in the evening Chronicle  --  had not the whole world seen it ?  --  about the shepherd boy who had been visited centuries ago by a white bird that had also changed into the Mother Mary , telling him then to lead a Holy Crusade . Even little Elaine 's innocent gift at Christmas of the small porcelain statue of Mary with the bleeding heart now seemed almost terrifying in its hidden portent . Then , too , there was poor Eddie Wilson with the broken back , suffering like Ely a saint 's end , dying in Sister Betty 's arms with Ely 's name on his lips and something like " God " before  --  and he had not even been near Ely in the mine ! And what of the puzzling " black hand " slaying of Mary Harlowe 's cat ? Was it not another sign ? So clear ! So foreboding ! And how excited Willie and Mabel Hall had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale as a ghost , told Clara he had stayed home from the mine that night just because it had been the eighth of the month . Oh , true ! true ! And with such seeming irreversibility had it all proceeded ! The Evening Circle meetings so well attended , so much spiritual excitement , the anxiety of all to learn  --  not even Brother Abner 's momentarysullenness could dull their zeal for the Lord and their eager faith in Ely ! " Forgetting the things which are behind , and stretchingforward to the things which are before , press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus ! " Yes ! yes ! they had been as one ! She and Ely had lived among them , mostly hardworking mining people , almost all their lives , and they had responded ardently to her call . Sorely afflicted , they had found hope in a faith renewed by love : her love and Ely 's . The eighth of the month ! The moment had grasped them all , each and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current , had called on them all to " run with patience the race that is set before us ! " and had preached in church on the faith of the prophets . Like a thunderclap of doom had come his inspired message the week before : " And by faith Noah , being warned by Almighty God concerning events as yet unseen , he took heed and , moved with a godly fear , prepared him an ark to the saving of his house , and by this he condemned the world ! " Dear old Gideon Diggs had leapt right up in the church and cried out , " Lord ! I believe ! " And the whole congregation had stood with him and prayed as a body . And it was these who had come , rejoicing . . and had left , reviling . Why , it had not even been her , but Brother Willie Hall who , when informed that Giovanni Bruno was too weak still to attendp168their special February eighth meeting , had made the motion to assemblethis night in the Bruno home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the menfolk , Giovanni Bruno 's presence had seemed somehow crucial to them all . She had met him and so had reassured them that , though silent and in his illness withdrawn , he had shown himself no less profound and sensitive than Ely had so often said he was , and Betty and Mary had backed her up . But a Roman Catholic ? No , he was not one , and she 'd told them of his enthusiastic response to Ely 's teachings and had reminded them of his vision of the white bird  --  Ely 's white bird . Aye ! Aye ! Unanimously , they had agreed , and Clara had obtained that very night , from the man and his sister , the invitation . The way was made straight . And then , finally , the best of all possible signs : almost none had stayed away , not even Abner and Sarah Baxter , and all had come with fear and great joy in their hearts . " The darkness is passing away and the true light already shineth ! " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no children , as if by agreement they had all been left at home , and if tonight were  --  ? But it was Abner 's work , she had learned  --  what was it had turned so true a man ? And Clara had prudently avoided making an issue of it . Meek Mary Harlowe had ducked her eyes on greeting , and Betty Wilson had seemed fretful , anxious to speak of something , but the press of time had not allowed it . A few moments , then , at the outset , of awkward silence and muffled introductions , the harsh unresponsive stare of Giovanni  --  " He 's got a fever , " Clara had alibied  --  and his sister 's gentle but faintly hostile shield , the aroma of medicine , of bedclothes , of somethingforeign , something like sin , yes , there was sin here , wine and television and tobacco and Roman Catholic pictures and crosses , and the sister , sensuous , too pretty really ; and not to mention the long preliminary march from the front door through the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even beforegetting to the bedroom , and then the Nortons  --  oh , why had they come ?  --  he kindly enough and at first conversational , but that brittle icy woman , so openly annoyed , so imperiously silent , refusing to participate yet placing herself at the very head of Giovanni Bruno 's bed  --  what did she think they wanted ? What did she fear ? But her people had crowded in and soon the room was as if the world and they as if its people , united in faith . A natural reticence at first , of course , but Clara had marshaled them quickly to her side.  |p169Emboldened  by the truth she carried and the grace upon her , she had led them in opening prayer , beseeching and exhorting them to open their hearts to Christ Jesus and earnestly prepare His way . For in just such manner , behind shut doors , He had appeared to the Eleven , had He not ? Yes ! Yes ! " Oh why are ye troubled ? And wherefore do questionings arise in your hearts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night ! " Yes ! He comes ! He is coming ! " When folks say , Peace and safety , ' then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child , and they shall in no wise escape ! " Come , Lord ! Come ! " Oh spirit of holiness , on us descend ! " Their voices rose in fervent song . " But ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief , for ye are all sons of light ! " Amen ! Amen ! " For God appointed us not unto wrath , but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ! " How they 'd worshiped ! How they 'd praised ! Knowing not the form of the event , they sought only a readiness and a unity of spirit . Sister Tess Lawson , so slow to submit , had fallen to her knees to confess her sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had thought then of her friends in distant places , had begged God that He have mercy on them and others who could not be present . " In Him it is always yea ! " Giovanni Bruno , too , though silent , had been ever watchful , joining them , she could see , in spirit , trembling faintly as they called in tearful joy upon the Lord . " For the Lord hisself shall come down from heaven above ! with a shout ! with the voice of the archangel ! and with the sound of the trump of God ! and the dead in Christ shall rise first ! " After ten o'clock ! Oh dear God ! They sang , they prayed , they read . Brother Gideon stood and broke into inspired prayer , admonishing them to rejoice in the Lord always and in all ways , and to " put on the whole armor of God ! " His melodic old voice rose and , falling all to their knees now , they chanted their amens . Clara , in her blur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frustration and anger of the terrible powers of evil in the glittering eyes of Mrs. Norton  --  knew suddenly with whom she contended ! " And , above all , take up the shield of faith , wherewithye kin quench all the fiery darts of the evil one ! and take the helmet of salvation  --  yes ! and the sword of the Spirit ! yes ! which is the word of God ! Oh sisters ! hear me ! brothers ! pray ! Pray at all times ! pray in the Spirit ! pray in the Glory ! pray in the name ofp170Lord Jesus ! If ye shall ask , ' He says , if ye shall ask in my name , ' He says , well , that will I do ! ' And rejoice ! rejoice in the Lord always ! I say , rejoice ! " Eleven chimed the wall clock . They sang . " That Old Rugged Cross . " Her daughter Elaine , at her side , lifted her sweet timid voice in courage and pride . " Oh Beulah Land , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , Ely ! Ely ! Ezra Gray called for repentance , and Sister Thelma Coates led them in a new wave of confessionof love for the Lord Jesus . And Clara read Ely 's message aloud and Giovanni Bruno clapped his hands as though in benedictionand even in that hard woman 's eyes the anger dimmed and Elaine called , " Oh Pa ! Pa ! " and Brother Abner , whom Ely himself had converted and baptized , even Brother Abner joined them then with all his heart . " Behold ! " he thundered and they all praised . " The Judge standeth before the door ! The coming of the Lord is at hand ! " They shouted and wept . " Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation , and the rich in his humiliation , he will pass away ! " And they clapped and cried in unison with him . " Come now , ye rich ! Weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you ! " Perspiration pocked his pale brow and his jowls shook with righteous fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hour cometh , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God ! And them that hear shall live ! " Yes ! We shall live ! Mercy ! " But woe to him who heapeth up what is not his own ! him who getteth an evil gain for his house ! him that buildeth a town with blood and establisheth a city by iniquity ! " Woe ! Woe ! Yes , Brother Abner ! Amen ! Clara 's heart leapt : 11:45 ! " For , I tell you , he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God ! " Oh Lord , save us ! Oh Brother Abner , tell us ! " And he shall be tormentedwith fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb ! " Abner paused to breathe and Sarah Baxter 's whimper trickled into the gap : " Have mercy on the children , Lord ! " But Abner roared above her : " And the smoke of their torment goeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And ever ! " Repent ! Clara felt suddenly a something , a hand , gripping her elbow ! Assured now , yet possessed with a holy fear , she turned : but it was only her little Elaine , tears washing down her pale cheeks , bravely smiling " But do ye beware , my friends , of false prophets , deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ ! " Clara turned , looked , appalled . The room , as though itself a living body , shocked and terrified , fell silent , its whole breath caught . Abnerp171Baxter stood , shook his head , the red hair wild as a lion 's mane , and glowered down upon her . No doubt : it was she he meant ! Something empty and hollow bloomed and began to grow in her . Five minutes remaining still , and what was he  --  ? " But be not deceived : God is not mocked ! " " Abner ! " She could hardly believe it . " Abner , they 's jist five minutes ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her voice was hushed and faltered . " Ely said  --  " I tell you what the Lord says , woman ! He says : Woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have not seen nothing ! ' Now you listen , Sister Clara ! The Lord He has not sent you , and you 've made all these here people trust in a lie ! " He paused , this man blessed by Ely 's love and lifted up by Ely 's blood , paused : for the dread hour was near upon them . " Who are you to judge another 's gifts ? " asked a gentle voice with a calm , a mildness , strange to this awesome hour . With unbelief , Clara saw that it was Mrs. Norton who had spoken . Abner Baxter glared , astonished , at the little woman by Giovanni Bruno 's bed . " You shall see for yourself ! " he bellowed , and taking his wife Sarah brusquely by the arm , he turned to leave the room . At the bedroom door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This day shall end and the false prophecy shall be disgraced ! Do you hear me ? You will be put to shame , Clara Collins , and so will they all who stay here with you ! " And , with Sarah , he departed . Roy and Thelma Coates hesitated just a troubled second , then followed them out of the bedroom . The clock began to strike the hour . " Wait ! " Clara cried . " In the name of Christ Jesus , wait ! " But none had waited , not a one . With each throbbing chime of the midnight hour , they had stood and left her , slowly at first , uneasily , lacking conviction , then , as though somehow fearing to be in the house after midnight , more and more hastily , until at the end they were running , the men clumsily light-footed out of their mining boots , the women scraping and clacking their heels across the wooden dining room floor , carrying their coats , Clara running after , pleading , and Abner 's chastisements roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide she had to struggle against , until , with the last hollow knock of the hour , she found herself alone , alone and weeping like a child , betrayed , crushed down , and for a long time , as she lapsed lifeless on the sofa , the last peal of the clock echoed and resounded in her head like a mockery of trumpets . Alone . Alone and forsaken in a foreign place . Forsaken even . . . even by Ely.  |p172The  voice , then , was in the air , speaking , before she heard it . She stored its syllables in her despairing mind , then contemplated them . " Have you forgotten , Mrs. Collins , what the Bible says ? Do not regardlightly the discipline of the Lord , ' it warns , nor lose courage when you are punished by Him . Consider Him Who endured from sinners such hostility against Himself , so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted . ' " The woman stood in the open doorway between the living room and dining room , the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television playing on her face . Elaine crouched stricken near her against a wall , soft sobs barely audible breaking from her small chest like fitful punctuation . " Now , will you please come back ? Giovanni has asked to show something to you . " She lacked all strength to resist . Mechanically , walled in by her grief , Clara lifted herself from the couch , took Elaine 's frail shoulder , followed Mrs. Norton back , through the dining room , into the bedroom . It was empty , but the heat and odor of an anxious massing were still present . Giovanni lay , as before , on his bed , propped by pillows , but now a Bible  --  Clara 's own Bible  --  rested in his lap . With his finger , he was pointing to a passage . At Mrs. Norton 's urging , Clara approached him and read . It was the Gospel according to John , chapter one , verses ten and eleven : " He was in the world , and the world was made through him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and they that were his own received him not . " " Giovanni , to whom do you mean this to apply ? " asked Mrs. Norton . " To Mrs. Collins ? " Giovanni Bruno nodded solemnly . " Indeedperhaps , each in his own way , to all of us here ? " Something in her voice of awe , a kind of God-fear sound , when she spoke to him . And again he nodded . Mrs. Norton turned to her , and Clara observed now a patience , a compassion , in her face , a face , she saw instantly , that had known hurt and suffering like herself . " As Jesus is said to have told His disciples , Mrs. Collins : If the world hates you , know that it has hated me before it hated you . ' Marcella dear , is there any coffee ? " The girl smiled openly . " Yes , I 'll get some . Do you take cream or sugar , Mrs. Collins ? " " No , but Elaine  --  " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and together they went to the kitchen . " I . . . I 'm sorry , " Clara said , addressing no one in particular , except God Himself maybe . Her eyes were still full of tears , but shep173felt all cried out . " I do n't know . I do n't understand . I thought .. but , well , you seen it . I jist do n't  --  " " Giovanni Bruno , hear me ! " The woman was again addressing the sick man , and again that hollow sound to it . Clara watched , not knowing quite what to make of it , yet fascinated just the same . " Is there any reason why . . . why nothing has happened tonight ? " Again : the solemn affirmative nod . " Is it because . . . is it because there were perhaps hostile forces of darkness present ? " Giovanni Bruno nodded . The woman relaxed , sighed , turned again to Clara . " It may be , Mrs. Collins , " she said , " that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , smiling as though at something just said , Giovanni 's sister bringing the coffee , Clara 's daughter Elaine followingwith a tray of cups and cream and sugar . For the first time since the mass exodus , Clara was reminded of the other presence in the room : Mr. Norton , chubby and humble-spirited , stepped out of a corner and came over to accept a cup of coffee . He smiled cordially at Clara as he spooned three heaps of sugar into his coffee and added cream . " I hope you 're feeling better , " he said . " I 'm feelin ' a mite like a fool , " Clara confessed frankly . He smiled again at that . " Well , " he acknowledged in a familiar drawl , " I do n't know anybody who has expressed himself more eloquentlyon being a fool for the truth than the apostle Paul himself . " " Well said , Wylie ! " avowed his wife , and Clara had to admit , too , that it was so . She sipped the hot black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother , lifting a cup to his lips . He was apparently still very weak . It was a little curious how he had got ahold of her Bible , in fact . Elaine , sitting meekly by the Bruno girl , smiled over at her , and Clara smiled back . " Who is this Mr. Baxter ? " Mrs. Norton asked . " Do I understand that he is the minister at your church ? " " Yes , that 's right , " Clara said . " Now he is . " " But your husband was the minister before . " " Yes . " She felt the tears returning , concentrated on the coffee . " What does the Bible say , Mrs. Collins ? I confess , I 'm not very good at quoting it offhand . But does n't it say something about those who preach from envy and rivalry ? " " Yes , they 's something like that , I think . But you mean . . . you mean , you reckon Abner 's jealous of  --  ? But Ely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got cause to  --  " " True , Mrs. Collins , but you live still , and , through you , in spirit , lives your good husband yet . Is n't that so ? "  | " Yes . Yes , I allow it is . I had n't thought of it like that . " For the first time , the vague hostile rumblings of the past month , especially those touching her leadership of Evening Circle , began to make sense to her . Why had n't it occurred to her before ? There was a silence , then , as they drank their coffee . Clara began contemplating the bitter walk home to their empty house . Mrs. Norton glanced over at Giovanni from time to time , and , absently , Clara soon found herself doing the same . What ? Did she expect something ? Marcella poured more coffee . And then the doorbell rang . Everybody started , looked wonderstruck at each other . Marcella went to answer . . . and returned with Betty Wilson ! Betty burst weeping into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry , Clara ! Lord , I jilt do n't know whatever come over me ! I was skeered is all ! It was  --  oh , Clara , please , I 'm  --  " " That 's okay , Betty , " Clara said . " I almost felt like goin ' out on myself myself . " With that , everyone smiled a little , and Betty stopped her crying . " How about a cup of coffee ? " " Well , I . . . " Betty wiped her eyes , glanced around her now , uneasy in the presence of these strangers . " Ifn you think . . . ifn you think it 's all right . . . " " Of course it 's all right , Mrs. Wilson , " Mrs. Norton said warmly . " We 're happy you have come back . It 's a very good sign . " Dr. Nortoncarried over a chair . Marcella brought coffee . And then it happened . Giovanni Bruno lifted his hand . Mrs. Norton , with a gasp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood rigidly , expectant . Marcella set the coffeepot down , slipped over by the bed . Weak but yet resonant , Giovanni Bruno 's voice entered the still room for the first time : " The coming . . . of . . . light ! " Mrs. Norton drew a quick sharp breath . Clara stood , felt Betty and Elaine fearful at her side . " When ? " asked Mrs. Norton . There was a long pause . Giovanni 's eyes moved among them , returned to stare upon Mrs. Norton . " Sunday . . . " he said , " . . . week . " He dropped his hand . Clara started to speak up , to ask what this was about , but Mrs. Norton held up her hand for silence . " The coming of light ? " she repeated , and Giovanni nodded . " Sunday week ? " Again , he nodded . " Giovanni Bruno , hear me ! Is there anything . . . is there something more ? " A pause . And then he shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . The movement made his hair splay outp175on the pillow , and Clara was astonished to see how really long it had grown . Mrs. Norton relaxed , but when she turned from the bed to face them , Clara saw tension and worry on her face still . " What is it ? " asked Clara , though she had already begun to grasp it . Though frightened , she was ready : she had been tested , she realized , and found true . " I do n't know exactly , Mrs. Collins . " Then : " May I "  --  she fingereda small gold medallion that hung around her neck on a chain  --  " may I explain something to you ? " Clara nodded . She sat , in awe , but feeling Ely close at her side once more . Vince Bonali stopped up at the Eagles one night for a whiskey , keeping nothing at home but beer these lean days . From the minute he walked into the place , he was reminded of old Angelo Moroni , and from then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to school together , hunted women together , broken into mining and drunk together , were best men at each other 's weddings , had worked their ways up simultaneously to be facebosses out at Number Nine . And they had always teamed up to play pitch and pinochle . Ange with his hat tipped down to his nose , Vince deadpan with a mouthful of cigar , unbeatable goddamn combination : that was mainly what hit him when he walked in . Sal Ferrero was shooting pool with Georgie Lucci . Vince carried his whiskey over , sat down on a stool to watch . They bandied sober hellos around . Sal and Angie and he used to make a trio , ever since Sal married Ange 's sister . In recent years , Sal only worked as a repairmanin the mine , and in a different section at that , so they 'd kind of split apart , but family functions always saw them together again , and he and Sal had seen a lot of each other since the disaster . Sal was a small wiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , knew how to joke around with the best of them , always on hand when help was needed . He was one of the first guys down into the mine after the explosion , told Vince later he 'd mainly gone downp176to look for him and Ange . He 'd found Ange , okay . Lucci was one of the four guys in Vince 's gang who 'd panicked after the blast and run out without knowing where they were going . Lucci and his buddy Brevnik had lucked out . Lee Cravens and Pooch Minicucci had gone the wrong way . Tomorrow , Vince had to deliver the relief checks to their families . Happy Valentines . He did n't look forward to it . " Want in ? " offered Sal , straightening up . He had just muffed a shoo-in on the ninespot . " No , thanks , " said Vince . " I get a bigger charge outa watching the exhibition . " " Then keep your eye on this'n , Vincenzo old culo , " growled Georgie down the length of his cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of clicks , he pocketed both the nine and the fifteen , then proceeded to clean the table . Sal plunked a half dollar on the table while Georgie was still lining up the last ball . " Never could do any good on Friday the thirteenth , " he said . So it was , Friday the thirteenth . " Find anything yet ? " asked Georgie , leaning into his shot . " Not yet . " Vince had found himself caught up in an odd sense of nervous exhilaration the past week or so , but it was starting to fade on him . What kicked it off was saying out loud what he 'd wanted to say for thirty years : he was through with coalmining . He 'd put in a couple applications around town , talked to different people , boasted how he was commencing the new life , fifty years or no . Everybody 'd agreed that yes , by God , he was doing the right thing . Took a lot of nerve to try to learn new tricks when you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated that . In fact they sometimes harped on it so much , Vince would get a little jittery . Just what the hell could he learn to do ? he 'd ask himself ; then , just as quickly , he 'd shove the dumb question aside : let 's see what they ask him to learn first . Georgie plucked the coin off the felt , emptied the far pockets as Sal racked . " I hear Guido Mello got on at the garage where Lem Filbert 's working , " he said , and chalked his cue . " Yeah , that 's right , " Vince said . He 'd tried there , asked too late . Awful lot of guys seemed to have the same idea he had . Vince 's kids , the two still at home , Charlie and Angie , had showed right off they were pleased , had talked up the change , they made big plans for the future . Charlie , actually getting halfway friendly to him for the first time in the kid 's useless life , would flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned up . Vince always returned the boy a healthy line . Give the kid a little ambition by example . Began to consider taking him fishing when spring came on , Charlie had never taken an interest like the other boys , go upstatefor a couple days maybe , sleep out . If he 'd just stop snapping his goddamn fingers . Georgie broke the racked balls with a tremendous splat . Vince himself preferred to break soft , but Lucci liked the wide-open game . " Pretty big show last week , " Lucci said . " Yeah ? " asked Vince mechanically . Heard some cards rattling loosely against each other over near the bar , then the flick flick flick of the deal . Caught himself glancing around for Ange . Lucci , trapped in the wide scatter of balls , had to use two cushions to get at the one , sitting like a pale orange near a sidepocket . He escorted the ball with twists of his hips , grunts and Italian obscenities , but missed just the same . " Yeah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the least our Big Number One Hero could 've done is share some of that fucking loot with his old buddies . " At first , Vince did n't know what the hell Lucci was talking about . Was n't paying attention . " Oh , you mean Bruno , " he said after a moment . " Well , buddy , those are the breaks . " Sal stared across the green expanse of the table toward Vince , then looked down as though studying his shot . Vince knew what it meant . Sal was feeling it , too . Things were upsidedown . Self-consciously , Vince swallowed down his whiskey , moseyed back to the bar for another . He leaned on the bar awhile , staring glumly into his sweating glass , wondering why the hell he did n't just go on home . Felt out of place . Like an old man at a kids ' party . What was wrong ? He had tried to talk it out with Etta , but she never said anything . That 's the way she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the thirty years they 'd been married . She 'd absorb his harangues and projected joys into her big-spread 300-pound body , return some little joke or other , then leave him to make his own decisions . True , he sometimeswished she 'd turn on a little enthusiasm once in awhile , but on the other hand , whenever the kids with their interminable questionsbegan to get to him , it was a large relief to have her friendly silence around . They had both of them broken all the old family traditions , Etta the German ones , Vince the Italian , when they got married . Her folks over in Randolph Junction were n't so bad , though they hardlyp178ever got over to see them , but Vince 's old man had nearly pitched him bodily right out of the goddamn house when he found out . Finally , things had settled down , of course , as they always do . Etta was Catholic at least , helluva lot better one than Vince or most of his family for that matter , and that had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all the kids through their catechisms and their schoolwork , kept them clean and looking neat even through hard times  --  and they 'd known plenty  --  never failed to keep hot food in the whole family . So , eventually , his family had got used to her , made stale jokes about the difference between potatoes and pastas , even slipped and spoke Italian at her sometimes , and then they 'd all laugh . Underneath , it probably pissed Etta off a little , Vince figured ; she was still a German , even if her name did come to be Bonali , and it seemed like sometimes she got the idea they did it as a kind of insult . But Etta had decent manners , always knew when to take it easy ; really , by God , they got along fine . And he felt troubled now that he could n't give her more to hope for in her old age . When they married , Etta was a pretty exciting catch , tall and ripe-bodied and country fresh , though making a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Together , the two of them had brought off seven kids , all of them still alive and all well reared  --  well , all but Charlie maybe . The first five were married , living in different parts of the United States , and Angie , the youngest , was still in high school . It was Charlie who really burned Vince 's ass , just swaggering around all day , snapping his fingers , cracking his knuckles , dangling a butt in his thick lips  --  but still , goddamn it , Vince understood . He understood how it was to grow up in a house where the old man was out of work half the time and where there did n't seem to be any real future . As Charlie himself had put it , hurting Vince more than the kid knew : " You saw how Ange got it . That 's the real future , man ! " A chair scraped behind him , someone called out his name . Vince took a drink , lazed around , keeping one elbow on the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " came the twang . Chester Johnson , toothy hillbilly , another guy from Vince 's shift , but a different part of the mine . They were all hanging around up here , Jesus , the whole damned mine . What there was left . Johnson fluttered the cards in a loose-wristed shuffle . " Wan na sit in as my partner a hand or two ? " No , thanks , Vince thought , but there was something in the softp179tease of the shuffle , persuasive presence of jacks in that thin deck , that could set the moment aright if not the times . . . and next thing he knew , he found himself straddling an old metal folding chair , staring half-blind at harsh little cardboard faces who this night said just nothing to him . Johnson kept yakking away , could n't keep his goddamn mouth shut five seconds , talked off every play he made , kept overbidding . Vince lit a cigar , glared through the hovering smoke at Johnson . " What really grinds my ass , " Johnson was whining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuckin ' crybaby had to be the lucky dolly . " Vince looked up sharply . The other two guys said nothing , stared at their cards . So at least he was n't the only one , that was plain . He 'd been feeling guilty about his resentment at the fanfare surroundingBruno , but maybe if the other guys like Lucci and Johnson felt like he did , there was cause . Still in his miner 's clothes , still black with that stinking soot , Vince had made his visit that night to the gymnasium , had gone there to see Ange Moroni 's cadaver . One of four long black lumps laid out side by side with a fifth in a rubber bag . On a tarp on the basketball floor . Ange 's uppers were missing , black eyelids half open , showing a watery white stuff below that did n't look like eyeballs . Vince , though he rarely did now , had prayed for Ange . And for himself and all the other guys . " Jesus , Bonali ! " cackled Johnson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three , " snapped Vince , cutting him off . Both red jacks . " Aw , four , " Johnson drawled , topping him . Tipped his scrawny head one way , then the other , shrugged , grinned . " Spades , I reckon . Sure hope you got the jig , buddy . " They went down fast . Vince shuffled , cracked the cards roughly . " They makin ' all this big fuss , but shit , I bet he never knowed what hit him . " Johnson pushed on , the others nodding absently . Theme of the week apparently . Harsh nasal voice that pricked the ear : " Too many good goddamn guys got it . " Vince 's hands shook as he dealt the cards around . Johnson watched . " Guys like old Lee Cravens and old Ange Moroni and  --  " " One good thing about Moroni , " Vince butted in . " He knew how to keep his fucking mouth shut in a card game . " Johnson leaned back on two chair legs , stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " I du n no , boys , I think I 've had enough , " he said , flicker of a grin crossing his wide lipless mouth . " Air 's got a mite sour . "  | " Suits me , " said Vince , and shoved his chair back . Tossed down the rest of his whiskey , walked out . Friday the thirteenth . Felt rotten , really rotten . Hated Johnson , hated Bruno , hated even himself . Down the hill , man . " What a fucked-up world ! " he muttered . Even with the welcome money in his hand , Vince got no fun out of the idea of visiting the Minicucci and Cravens homes next morning . Stirring up the ashes , that 's all . He 'd seen nearly all of the familiesat the mass funerals about a month ago , had steered clear of them since . Just did n't feel comfortable , did n't know what to say , knew they could n't help but resent that he had got out . Pooch was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste all that artillery in just one little mousehole ?  --  but his folks more or less depended on him , so the charity committee had awarded them a full share of the money . Vince tried to take care of the business out on the front porch , but they dragged him on in , said it was too cold , sat him down in one of their overstuffed chairs , gave him wine , talked about Pooch and how he 'd looked so fine at the funeral , and how badly they did need the money . The room was overheated , bore that weighted odor of old people , old food , old dust , made Vince recall his Mama the last couple years before she died . Vince only understood about half the Italian . Slipping away from him . The old woman sucked her dry withered lips , spoke of God 's ominous ways , how important it was to be ready at all times , one never knew , un giorno o l'altro , life was brief and inscrutable . Vince nodded gravely , growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged , a soapbubble , his Mama 's pet commentary on life in this world . Vince fidgeted in the chair to keep awake , covered up best he could , finally had to admit he had n't been to Mass in over three years . Tre anni ! Ever since the kids had grown up , he said , but , yes , she was right , he figured to get started back , you never knew , any moment , a qualsiasi ora . " Ecco it momento ! " the old woman said , wagging her finger . And as she rattled on , Vince remembered his old blind grandmother tellinghim about hell when he was a boy . She was an expert on hell . If Vince ever ended up there , he was sure he 'd find his way around , she 'd imbedded forever in him a mental map of the place . He had nearly forgot , but now he found he was missing not a word of the old lady 's Italian , it was all there , he felt once more the claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foul mouths sucking out his eyes . Rapt but edgy , a boy again , he listened . The dwarfish tele/vision set pitched a silent nervous image into the room . Pooch 's old man was nodding off . " Tre anni ! " He apologized , thanked her for the wine , left somehow oddly grateful . But in West Condon 's old housing development , hell lost its charm , turned gray , and he grew old again . Old and tired and cold . He 'd got overheated in the Minicucci living room , and the cold was bitter . Get this over with , get home , take a hot bath . Wanda Cravens met him at the tattered screen door with a baby in her arms , toddler hanging on from below . Another kid whined somewhere inside . Never a very big girl , she now seemed more drawn than ever . Must not weigh even a hundred pounds , Vince thought . He felt sorry for her , glad he was bringing some money . He told her what he was there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was a wreck of cluttered junk , far from clean , far from warm , winter crawling across the bare floor , cockroaches scrambling alongside the wallboards . It looked more like a house after somebody had moved out than a place someone was living in . Vince found an arm of a waddy chair he thought would hold him , sat down gingerly against it . Wanda dropped the baby and toddler on a ragged throw rug in a corner with the cockroaches , shooed the older one , boy about three or four , on out the door , turned wearily toward Vince . She sure had it tough , okay . With a thin white hand , she pushed back a snarl of sandy-colored hair from her forehead , accepted the check he held out to her . They exchanged only a few words . Her voice was thin , had a hopeless lost distance about it . " I 'm sure you can use it , Wanda , " he said clumsily . She stood in front of him , a wooden table behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside the gray heap of clothes on the table , laid the check down , leaned over to examine it . Vince tried to come up with a couple remarks about what a swell guy he 'd always thought Lee was , dependable and goodnatured , but her dress , the starch out of it , hung with limp descriptiveness over her small hips , and talk about old Lee seemed weirdly irregular . The back of her left thigh touched his knee . " Lee was one of the greatest guys I ever worked with , Wanda , " he said , confused by the silliness of it . " It was a honor . . . " She leaned further over the table onto one elbow , closed her eyes , rubbed them . Jesus , the poor kid ! Her back trembled . Her legs were apart and the dress , folded wispily down the cleft of her buttocks , vibrated gently with her crying . If that was what she was doing . Vince stood up , unavoidably against her , laid his broad dark hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a back like that for years . " I . . . I guess I 'd better be shoving off . " But she butted back against him with a kind of sob , and he thought less about shoving off . His fingers slid to her waist and she curled around like an old routine into his arms , gazed sadly up at him . Her eyes were a little red , but probably from the rubbing , he got the idea right away she was faking it . Thing that surprised him most was how he was staying so goddamn cool . Felt keyed up , okay , but like a spectator caught up in some movie . Her tiny chest heaved a little against him . " Vince ! " she whispered , and it could have meant just about anything . Gentle-boned face , eyes a little close together like old Lee 's , cheeks dotted with mudcoloredfreckles , mouth a soft thin line with a slight overbite , her teeth a bit  --  They kissed . Vince yanked her in tight against his hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one big hand , went grabbing down for the lean thighs , felt the taut flesh snap back at him through the wilted cotton , a tautness he 'd nearly forgot in women . Wished he still had the little finger on that hand , felt like he was missing something . She broke away , buried her face in his chest . He looked down at her hair , coarse and dry like yellowed grass . An act , he thought , but he said , " I 'm sorry , Wanda , this is all wrong . Hell , I 'm not the kind of guy ever to . . . " He tried his damnedest to think of old Lee , that swell guy , but just could n't bring him well to mind , smelled the hair , odor of sweet soap , reluctantly let go her neat cranny , but she held on to him . " Do n't leave me , Vince ! " she whispered . " Wanda , listen  --  " " Vince , I 'm so terrible alone , you cai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real enough . The toddler had left the baby squalling on its back in the corner , had crawled over to where they stood embraced , and now had a grip on Vince 's pant leg . " Vince , it 's Valentine 's Day ! " she whispered into his mouth , then jammed her lips against it , her hand pulling mightily on his fly . He jerked up her dress , drove his hand down between her thighs as the three-yearoldbanged in through the front door , letting in a sharp gust of winter . Charlie announced that night he had joined the Marines . They were sitting in the living room watching television , Vince and Etta , and Vince said , " If you 're gon na butt in on the program , why do n't you tell us something important ? " Both he and Etta made a lot of wisecracksabout the Marines being the right place for a shaggy zootsuitp183bum like him , and Charlie wised back that at least he 'd get a decent meal now and then , and he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vince snorted , said he sure had a helluva lot to learn about the Marines . Charlie shrugged , tucked a butt in his mouth , moved out the door snapping his fingers . Vince watched him parade out , then turned to Etta to remark what a useless cocky grandstander that boy was , but checked himself just in time . Etta was crying . " Hey ! what 's the matter , chicken ? Was it something Charlie said ? I 'll go  --  " She shook her head . " I do n't care how bad they are , Vince , " she whispered through her tears . " I just hate to see them go . " Angela came in from her bedroom where she 'd been doing her homework . Music from her radio piped in to muddle with the television . " What 's Mom crying about ? " she demanded . Vince stammered a moment before he realized he was n't guilty of anything , then said , " Nothing , baby . Go on back to your studies . " " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vince supposed she 'd got the line out of some goddamn movie . That girl could get under a man 's skin sometimes . " It 's just that Charlie is going into the Marines , and your Mom  --  " " Oh , is that all ! Well , that 's hardly something tragic ! I 'd say it was good riddance of bad rubbish ! " She clamped her pencil between her neat white teeth , then apparently thought better of it and fitted it carefully over her ear , fiddled with a hairpin . There was a pause , filled only by an overemotional argument on TV and music from Angie 's radio that sounded to Vince like some guy having a public orgasm . Etta checked her sniffling , smiled feebly at Angie , and the girl went back to her room . Vince walked over , patted Etta gently on the shoulder . " Care for half a beer ? " She shook her head.Vince figured maybe they ought to try to work something up tonight , been a long time and he felt she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fell asleep watching an old movie on the set , and when he woke , Etta had alreadylong since turned in . One night in bed with Wanda not long after that , he happened to mention that he had a boy going into the Marines . " You already got a boy growed up , Vince ? " she asked absently . He swallowed , felt it shrivel . " Yeah , " he said . Decided not to mention the other six . At the bus station on Ash Wednesday , last week of the month , they made stale jokes about the snowstorm predicted and howp184Charlie , the lucky bastard , was headed south . Vince noticed how much taller the boy looked all of a sudden , and then , trying not to be nervous , said good-bye to Etta instead of Charlie . And from then on , there were just the three of them in the old house . March tore into West Condon on a sudden savage snowstorm . The lawyer Ralph Himebaugh , brooding over the sinister state of affairs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down butting the wind , feet secure in heavy galoshes , but still cold , cold to the bone . In the whine of wind and snow , there was little to see or hear . Ralph was a man removed , and it was as though the world were remarking the continuing aggravation of his isolation , as though nature herself were persecuting him , the victim , the sacrifice , the outcast . Disaster whistled at his wraps and portents stung his ears . Discord , famine , war , cruelty , deaths , rape  --  could n't the fools see it ? Every day , mounting , tragedy upon tragedy , horror succeedinghorror , oh my God ! It was too plain ! Yet their blindness was a part of it , was it not ? For years it had been clear to him , the pervasive current of mantling terror , discernible through the scrim of false and superficial reportage , and for years now he had kept records of its progress , scrapbooks of calamities and disasters , deathtoll lists , maps of its movements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodicity , the routes of passage , certain correlativities , duration and instantaneity , origin and distant derivative effects , expenditure of energy , parallelisms and counteractions , and , above all , its wake of mathematical clues . Oh , he was wise to have done so ! For although at the outset the incredible complexities had pitched him into a hell of confusion and despair , by disciplining himself , by literally chaininghimself to the task and pummeling himself to greater wakefulness , he had at last mastered the necessary technology . No , it had been no delusion , not at all ! Almost immediately , he had discovered the steady intensification of the disaster frequency , the irreversible course toward cataclysm.  |p185Suddenly  , as his own mind was on the terror , a car fluttering through the snow about a hundred yards away went into a spin . Ralph stood transfixed , appalled , as the black machine , mindless , yet possessedby its own inner necessities , lazed through wide chaotic circles in the unbounded street , then bumped up and stopped against a telephone pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross . Oh my God , my God ! How much time ? A man got out , startling Ralph . He had somehow forgot to expect a man . Ralph felt the old impulse , the impulse to flee , but he overrode it ; the recent years , while sobering , had engendered a new kind of courage . It was what emerged and took over , he supposed , when the old irrational constructsof hope and their false comforts were cut away . He stumbled through the snow toward the man , wind nearly blinding him . The man looked up , smiled , shook his head . " Damn ! " he said . " Just like a merry-go-round ! " " Are you all right ? " " Yeah . " The man laughed nervously . " But I 'm gon na leave her stuck right where she 's at and walk the rest of the way . Boy ! She really come in like a lion , did n't she ? " Ralph nodded , but did not return the stupid smile . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloved hands , and the man left him . His heart still racing , Ralph considered the car and the pole . When the man was out of sight , Ralph glanced about to assure himself of the snow 's effective screen , then kicked a dent in the door . " Goddamn you ! " he whispered . The rest of the walk home , the machine coiled and spun in maddening sweeps before his eyes . On his porch , he mechanically checked the mailbox , then remembered it was Sunday . He tugged off the galoshes and stepped inside to greet his cats , Grendel , Nabob , Melpomene , Nyx , and Omar . They were hungry and so attended his presence . Nabob twisted and coiled , rubbing against his moving leg . It was not love . Their emotionalrange was between indifference and pure hate . He could acceptthat , yet at times it hurt him , for , against his will , he could not help loving them . He turned into the kitchen and Nabob nearly tripped him up  --  he brought his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezer and put it to boil . He poured them some milk , but they lapped at it distractedly , their minds on the fish . Nyx sulked . He slipped her a piece of chicken liver . Nyx was a big pure-black animal with a long straight nose . Ralph feared her . " You hot black bitch ! " he whispered at her.  |p186While  the fish thawed and cooked , he sat down at his desk in the front room and recorded the car accident in the P.O.  --  Personal Observations  --  journal . While constructing an essentially objective system , Ralph did not entirely reject subjectivity from it : the mere fact that it was he who had assumed the responsibility of this task was in itself a subjective element , and he recognized it . It was not proven , after all , that the force was mindless  --  the purity of its mathematics would in fact argue the contrary  --  and were it not mindless , he could well expect to be regarded as its enemy . He unwrapped last Sunday 's Guardian and Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded data from them . The cats protested . He returned to the kitchen , poured the boiling water into the sink , dumped the fish on the cats ' plate . With his foot , he blocked Nyx ' approach to the plate , made sure the other four had got their share . She clawed his ankle , but he laughed and held her back a little longer . " One day . . . ! " he warned her . At his desk once more , he withdrew his scratchpad , did some hurried calculations . Still , the augmentation , the emergent numerical pattern , the cyclical behavior . Incredible ! He sighed , chewed meditativelyon the pencil , then began the task of carrying his figures all the way out . No , there was no escaping it . At the present rate of severity increase , mankind would necessarily be overcome within the next six or seven years . Six or seven years ! Meticulously he rechecked his figures , and with graph paper he described a varied set of conceivablecurves based on the slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And each time , it resulted in the same forecast  --  or suggested an even earlier date . Grotesque ! It would be grotesque ! This had happened before , of course , signs leading to the immediacyof catastrophe , and dates had in fact been passed , but always he had uncovered some fundamental error in the schematism itself , some critical factor omitted in ignorance from his computations . For example , at the very beginning he had simply listed all events as numerically equal , an appalling lack of sophistication that now amazed and embarrassed him in retrospect . But time and error had brought wisdom . Now , he was convinced , the system could not be more complete . There was no hope in it , given the human condition , for omniscient finality , to be sure , but it had to be taken seriously . The phone rang , startling him . What now ? But it was only Jim Elliott , the Chamber of Commerce secretary . He was working at home on the new industrial brochure and needed information onp187certain zoning ordinances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here at home . Elliott was a stupid arrogant ass . Himebaugh explainedthe problem . " But listen , Jim , if you really need the ordinances , I 'll go get them for you . " " Aw hell , no , Ralph ! Not out in that fucking mess . I just thought you might , you know , have them at hand , or something . " " No , but I really do n't mind . It is a nasty day , but  --  " " Do n't think twice about it ! Anyhow , there 's a game on TV , and I 'm sick of this goddamn brochure anyway . We 'll do it tomorrow . " " Well , if you insist . But do come in the first thing tomorrow . You know I wish to help all I can . How 's your family ? " " Oh , everybody 's fine , thanks . Fat and lazy . Sally 's sore at me because I would n't let her go out in the storm to a movie , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordially , chewed irritably on his pencil . Would the fool never shut up ? He and the mayor were the two men Ralph hated most in this stupid town . They never wearied of imposing on his good will with their infantile little games and incredibly insignificantproblems . And , God , they monologized without cease . Now it was that hateful brochure . And it was useless , utterly useless . They would never recover from the mine disaster , of that Ralph was sure . But what good would it do to tell them ? They were all sick . " See you tomorrow then , Ralph . " " Yes , I 'll keep the day entirely free for you , Jim . Give my best to your good wife . " " Thanks , I 'll do that . Hang loose , now ! " Ralph laughed lightly , as he supposed he was expected to do , and cradled the receiver . The idiot ! The cats , fed , had composed themselvesabout the house . One of them scratched in the sand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a gradually darkening world , vanishing under the deadweight of snow . The wind had diminished , but the snow still sifted down heavily . There would be accident suits and insurance claims . He poured himself a snifter of cognac , brushed Omar out of the armchair , and curled up moodily in it , alongside his several scrapbooksand records . He started back about seven years , flipped slowly through , disaster after disaster , pausing meditatively at unusually significant events or peculiarly grotesque ones , letting his mind drift unanchored through the accumulating morass of woe and rot and grief . Slowly the black shape grew . It came to bear , as it had every day for nearly two months , upon the explosion at the Deepwaterp188Number Nine Coalmine , seemed to hover like thick black fumes over that ravaged pit . What did it mean , why was it that single horror so impressed him ? He knew full well it was purblind to place exaggeratedemphasis on one event merely because of its proximity , yet he could not rid his mind of the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , him in particular , some vital urgent message : as though  --  as though he had been the intended victim and had in some incredible manner escaped , and now he had one more chance , one more chance to find the way out , to discover the system that would allow him to predict and escape the next blow . The number ninety-seven , the number of the dead , was itself unbelievablyrelevant . Not only did it take its place almost perfectly in the concatenation of disaster figures he had been recording , but it contained internal mysteries as well : nine , after all , was the numberof the mine itself , and seven , pregnant integer out of all divination , was the number of trapped miners . The number between nine and seven , eight , was the date of the explosion , and the day of the rescue was eleven , two one 's , or two , the difference between nine and seven . Nine and seven added to sixteen , whose parts , one and six , again added to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe of the line , a fourth-dimensional figure , hardly less important than sixtyfour , one more than the product of nine and seven . That product , sixty-three , also added to nine . And yet there was more : Though the acceleration curves for , as an example , energy expenditure and estimatedcellular destruction were not the same , yet all of his curves tended to approximate the common parabola produced by the graph of y = x2 , on which , as the value of x is increased by one in a series of whole numbers , the value of y increases as the square of the numbers in that series , and the value of the difference between the successivelengths of the accelerating y ordinates forms a series of odd numbers increasing at the rate of two units between each whole numberin the original x series . When the unit value of x has reached three  --  the quotient of sixty-three divided by twenty-one , the number of the day within the tenth sign on which rescue took place !  --  the related value of y becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of sixteen is seven ! It was through this astounding discovery that Ralph had been able to place himself with certainty upon the present moment of the parabola , lacking only a final calculation of the value or values of the single x unit . When he had that , he knew he would be invulnerable ! And it was not beyond his grasp , for he was slowly learning to measure the area under thep189several parabolas , and the area-function sooner or later would lead him to the ordinate-function , provided only he could finally expurgate these area measurements of all arbitrary components , which he believedhis current project of graph overlays would eventually do . His head spun . He uncurled , poured another snifter of brandy , watchingGrendel licking her genitals . Suddenly infuriated , he doused her with the cognac ; she started , scampered under the couch . Only Nyx could do that and not nauseate him . He poured another snifterful . And then there was ninety-seven plus one : the infamous productof seven and fourteen . For years he had resented the emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequence of stupid obedience to the religionists ' texts . Only late in life did he discover that these infantile texts were actually corruptions of older and infinitely more precise , infinitely less adulterated writings , now lost , and he now willingly suffered through the garbage in search of the sources , now willingly respected the generative powers of numbers like one and seven and twelve and fourteen . Plus one : Giovanni Bruno . Who was he ? Why was it he ? John Brown ! The very anonymitylent an unreal  --  or , rather , a superreal  --  odor to the occasion , a kind of terror , the terror inevitably associated with voids , infinities , absences , facelessness , zero . For seven weeks now , he had been contemplating a private conversation with the man . Ralph paced the living room . Perhaps he should go tonight . Yet , so much was at stake . His entire reputation in West Condon , for one thing . Nevertheless , a night like tonight , who would be out in it ? Who would there be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could always explain himself in terms of some obscure legal matter . Even a will or something ; God knows , the man should have a will . But how would he explain himself to Bruno himself ? No , it was better to wait , to be certain , to have the questions precisely formulated . He poured more cognac , again stroked Omar out of the armchair , curled into it now with a thin jacketless book . He tried to read it , but could not concentrate . Why was it so famous ? It was a pack of emotional ignorant ravings ! He threw it down . The destroyer , damn it ! The destroyer ! They all saw it , but could not face it . Oh , the cowards ! Oh , the disgusting yellow pigheads ! Oh , the sniveling pissants ! He again paced , cursing them , and drank his cognac . Precious ninnies ! Asses ! Babbling little chickenshits ! Mel came tearing through the room , Nyx at her heels , and they rolled and tumbled , bounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They tangled in the cord of his desk lamp , brought it down withp190a crash . Separately , they scampered , but not before he had grabbed the broken lamp and brought it down punishingly on Mel 's sleek haunches . They hid . He crouched on his hands and knees , struggling to breathe . The room seemed to be afloat . He spied Nyx . With the lamp , on all fours , he stalked her . She curled her lip , emitting a kind of vicious snorting hiss . In his hand , the broken lamp shook . " You goddamn nigger whore ! " he snarled . But he could n't hit her . Dizzily , he stood . He got a broom , swept the broken glass into a dustpan , emptied it into the wastebasket by his desk . His hands were quaking uncontrollably . Better read something , something to forget about it , he thought , but then decided on a warm bath instead . The water at least was hot and soothing . He lay in the tub , closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Was that how it would get him ? Sink into his mind like a fungus ? The bubbles were fragrant and oily . He let the hot water trickle into the tub to raise the temperature . It burned his toes , crept up past his ankles , advanced like a living thing toward his fork . " Destroy me ! " he whispered , but it was only ritual . His mind was still in the living room , still with the graphs , still with the mine . He sat up , the water boiling hot now around his hips , and sipped cognac . " Mel ! " he whispered . " Grendel ! " But he got no response . He lay back . It was hot on his back and chest , and he flinched , but he stayed down . He tried to imagine the room , the fat mindless beast stalking her , circling , observing her from every angle . " Your brother deserved to die ! " he hissed . He was breathing heavily , stroking , clawing , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldly , contemptuously , faintly disgusted . He sat up and turned off the hot water . In spite of a gathering nausea , he finished the snifter of cognac . He rested his head on the edge of the tub . " Oh , damn you ! " he cried . He grew uncomfortable . Hastily , he soaped his armpits and genitals , rinsed , and got out . He dried himself before the mirror , slipped into his lounging robe , returned to the living room for a cigarette . He decided to eat something , but poured more cognac instead . He pulled the blinds , turned on lights . Outside , it was dark , still blustery . He curled into the chair , patted his lap , and Mel hopped up , made herself comfortable . On her haunches , a streak of still-fresh blood . " Poor little sister ! " he said , stroking her gently . Tears came , and he sniffled . He would kill Nyx someday . Yes , he would ! Mel 's fur was silky against him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he felt too weary , too wretched , to bother to go get the fish oil . He sighed , shuddered . " Oh God ! "  |p191he  whispered , then grew suddenly angry . " What 's the matter with you ? " he cried . He jumped up from the chair , flipping the cat to the carpet , and strode into the bedroom to dress . Enough of this babying around ! He 'd go tonight ! To hell with the risks ! He had to see Bruno and get this thing straightened out , and right now . Tonight ! Snow pyramided the old Chevy and drifted deep in the streets , so Miller walked over , feeling faintly ridiculous . Hark ye to the White Bird . Oh boy . In the wind , he chainsmoked , lighting from the butt end of the old the new . The snow flew , though he could see , during lulls , that not much new snow was falling . Maybe no one else would show up . There was that to hope for . Many reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think them out , had prompted him to accept when Marcella had called to invite him : the germ of a salable story , his own everlastingly perverse amusement with eccentricity , and so on , but mostly , he supposed , it was a kind of sudden gamy wish to raise a little hell . West Condon was going stale on him , needed a spectacle . Moreover , he had been standing nude and elegantly if awkwardly protracted , having been drawn to the phone from under knowledgeable hands , and had too self-consciously seen himself as for the sweet moment suspendedbetween two female hungers ( Golgotha : that timeless ubiquitousimage ! ) . Happy Bottom , with characteristic impatience , had lobbed a pillow , bringing down his tacked-up list of ever-ready phone numbers : hastily , then , he had acceded to the request of one thief , not to forfeit the voracity of the other . House lights laid down luminous trapdoor patches on the snow here and there , but mostly , on the walk to the Brunos ' , there was just a darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March : which led to the possibility it might go out with the Lamb . Miller laughed , stepped up his pace , enthused once more by the chance to look in on these types . After all , they needed him , for he believed he might have been indirectly responsible for having set the date.  |p192Marcella  had called him the day after Clara Collins ' eighth of Februarypageant to tell him all that had happened and what her brother had said , though this time she 'd asked him not to print it . They were planning to meet again the following Sunday in response to her brother 's pronouncement , she had said , but Miller , already committedwith Happy for that night , had suggested an alternative readingof " Sunday week " : a week of Sundays . He had had vaguely in mind seven weeks from the eighth , but it had apparently got interpretedfinally , by way of Eleanor Norton 's arcane sources , as tonight , seven Sundays from Bruno 's rescue . Marcella , who was the other and no doubt most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , stood backlit by a dull hall bulb while he struggled with his boots . He tossed them with the others  --  he would not be alone  --  and flicked his cigarette out into the drifts , brushed the snow from his shoulders , entered . Marcella closed the door behind him , turned toward him , touching an index finger to her lips for silence as she took his coat . Her blouse , even in this poor light , was incredibly white . Alive . With it , she wore a coffee-colored skirt , pleated , a little juvenile maybe , but he was too caught up in the way her gently molded hips disturbed the pleats ' verticals to want it otherwise . She stretched up to toss his hat on the shelf above the coats , causing a new play of lights and shadows in the blouse . He touched her elbow gently , took the hat , laid it on the shelf , had the pleasure of her forearm 's lingering slide down through his fingertips . He 'd forgot , in all the grosser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled down at her , feeling four-handed without either the camera or a body trained to his touch . " Am I late ? " he whispered . " No , " she said . " Mrs. Collins is n't here yet . The others are in my brother 's room . I do n't think they 're tremendously happy you 're coming . They seem awfully afraid of publicity or something , I do n't know why . " " Do n't worry , " he assured her . " I 'll be careful . " She led him through the living room , behind her old father Antonio slumped in a chair before the television screen , coffee can on the armrest beside him : homemade cuspidor . On the screen , three splaypelvisedgirls dressed in animal skins did a kind of warped jazz ballet , the cheap set stunting their legs . Gabriel 's sisters , no doubt . A large fancy cake sat on the dining room table , neatly encircled by plates , forks , cups , spoons , and napkins . He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcella replied with a smile and a nodp193that she had . An antique cut-glass chandelier with electric candles , overbearing in this simple room of simple things , provided the light , left the room virtually shadowless except right under the table . Marcella showed him to a door leading off the back of the dining room : the downstairs bedroom which had been her brother 's since his return a month ago from the hospital . She knocked . Miller licked his lips . The game was on . The door cracked open . " What is your message ? " inquired a hushed male voice , so faint Miller barely understood it . " Hark ye to the White Bird , " Miller replied , and then Marcella echoed him . The door opened , and they were admitted . First thing he saw was Giovanni , sitting halfway up in bed , supported by a mound of pillows . He wore dark pajamas that exaggeratedhis pallor , had two or three blankets piled up on him to the waist . He turned his head  --  one thought of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head  --  to look as Miller and Marcella entered . The others in the room did the same : pivoted silently toward them . The room was lit by a nightlamp beside the bed and a few candles placed about ; aroma of tallow . At a small table near the foot of the bed , facing the door , sat Eleanor Norton , the high school teacher who had become Bruno 's spiritual counselor , and across from her , a squat pillowy woman in a cheap shiny dress . Black : must be one of the disaster widows . But which ? When she turned to peek at him over her shoulder , he found her face familiar , but he could n't place it . Two young boys sat stiffly in chairs next to the far wall . The doorkeeper , of course , was Eleanor Norton 's husband , Dr. Wylie Norton . And it was very quiet . " Good evening , Mrs. Norton , Dr. Norton , " Miller said into the silence . " How are you feeling , Giovanni ? Much better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added with measured concern , " I hope I have n't interrupted any . . . " " Not at all , Mr. Miller . " Wylie Norton smiled , extending his hand . " We 're glad you 've come ! " With Norton 's welcome , there were traces of relaxation all around . The two boys stood , came over , were introducedby Norton as Colin Meredith and Carl Dean Palmers , seniors at the high school . They were both shy , slow to commit themselves in any way , but Miller spoke frankly with them , and they were soon friendly . Meredith was a tall gangly boy with loose blond hair , a pink flush to his cheeks , tendency to stoop as he walked ; Palmers was shorter , stockier , had a bad case of acne , seemed more mature , more aggressive . Miller noticed Palmers ' missing tooth andp194asked if he were the Palmers who played guard this year on the varsity football team . The boy grinned awkwardly and nodded , obviouslypleased to have been recognized . The name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he turned to the plump widow . " Mrs. Wilson , I 'm Justin Miller . I do n't know if you remember me , but we  --  " " Oh , yes , " she said quickly , kittenish little whimper of a voice . " You wrote up such nice things when I lost . . . when I lost . . . " And she began to pucker up . " Now , now ! " intervened Eleanor Norton . " Please remember , Mrs. Wilson , we must all stand firm ! " She glanced up sharply at Miller , partly accusing , partly as though seeking  --  but seeking what ? Some kind of signal , or  --  ? Miller nodded firmly . He thought of saying something like " I 'm sure that 's how Eddie would want it , " but it was just too cornball , he might start grinning , so he kept silence . He let his gaze lift past the two women toward Giovanni , fixed , he hoped , with an adequate awe . For the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what had happened , what was expected , it was the best he could do for Mrs. Norton . On the wall over the headboard of the bed , there was a crucifix . Other things framed here and there . What looked to be an old wedding portrait of Antonio and Emilia : something of the old woman in Marcella , all right . " We have been discussing certain instructions , Mr. Miller , " EleanorNorton said suddenly . She had a precise gentle voice that cut cleanly through the silence . " Instructions from . . . from the worlds beyond us . " She paused . Miller , coming back to the table , noticed now the book open on it between the two women , a blank book , bound , the kind used for record-keeping . " These are messages receivedover the recent weeks from . . . from them , by way of extrasensoryperception . " Miller did n't know what to say to that , so he merely returned , unsmiling but genuinely attentive , her gray-eyed gaze . This , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proximity bolstered him , yet he felt vaguely uneasy about her presence , witness to this act of his . " We are anxious , all of us , to comprehend what we can from them , and we are quite naturally . . . pleased , Mr. Miller , to have with us in our endeavors the sincere interest of all fellow beings whose motives are pure and who will . . . that is , who will participate in our meditations in a spirit of hope and honesty and . . . in a positive spirit , let me say . " " Of course , Mrs. Norton . Let me  --  "  | " But do understand , we are not like . . . like evangelists , Mr. Miller . Quite the contrary . We believe , in quiet unpretentious and unadvertised gatherings . " " Sure , " said Miller . " I can understand that you 're concerned about my being a newspaper editor . But I can assure you , Mrs. Norton , that my interest here has nothing to do with my paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to . Unless , " he added , feeling adventurous and addressing the whole room , " we all do . " The doorbell rang . " That must be Mrs. Collins , " Marcella said , and left him to stand alone . Miller watched her go , moving lightly , a spontaneous gladness seeming to lift her up . She glanced back at him from the door and they exchanged smiles , surprised at each other 's attention . Miller pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket , turned to offer one to Wylie Norton , standing beside him , but Mrs. Norton came up , put her hand over his pack : " Please , Mr. Miller . No smoking . " And she turned her head significantly toward Bruno , who watched them darkly . " Of course , " he said , returning the cigarettes to his pocket . Here but a couple minutes , and he 'd already forgot that the sick miner was even in the room . As for Mrs. Norton , she seemed jumpy and peremptory , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins ' imminent arrival . Eleanor had had Bruno  --  and Marcella , too  --  entirely to herself until three weeks ago when Clara Collins appropriated him to her own vision . The February eighth show , as he understood it , was a kind of emotional steamroller , with Eleanor Norton finally outlasting them all and obtaining a tenuous kind of intellectual control over Clara . After four times through the white bird routine , more ridiculous than ever from this side of the door , the widow Clara Collins strode noisily in with her daughter Elaine , the coalminer Willie Hall , and a woman who turned out to be Mabel Hall , Willie 's wife . Miller had had no idea the Halls would be here , Marcella had n't mentioned them , yet he was n't surprised , recalling his interview of Hall , Oxford Clemens ' buddy , just after the disaster . Hall , he remembered , lived by hunches . The Halls were introduced to everyone . Talk was about the snowstorm . Some took it as a portent . The boys , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Carl Dean said he recognizedElaine from a study hall they had together . While Elaine , hand covering her mouthful of bad teeth and small shouldersp196hunched , received shy attention from Meredith and Palmers , her mother swung horsily around the bedroom , greeted Bruno , the Nortons , Betty Wilson , never waiting for a reply . She seemed intent , nervous , self-important , yet respectful . She lugged a large shiny patent-leather handbag out of which she now pulled a man 's handkerchief , blew her nose stoutly . As she strode long-legged  --  Miller thought of trotters  --  over to him , he realized she was nearly as tall as he was . Then he saw that she was wearing heels tonight . White ones , odd for midwinter . Nylons , wrinkled , sparkled above the ankles with melted snow . " It 's a good thing you come , " she said to him , and he understood immediately that he would suffer no challenges from her . Somehow from the beginning , maybe because of his interest in her husband and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of hers . " We need folks like you here . " " I 'm sorry I was n't able to come before , " he said . " Well , maybe jist as good you did n't . " Trace of a smile touched the corners of her mouth . " We had a couple purty rough nights . But this'n 's apt to be a mite better . " The Halls tittered nervously . Miller asked about the meeting on the eighth , but she did n't seem to want to talk about it , except to repeat Bruno 's six-word message . As for the small and uneventful gathering on the fifteenth , she only shrugged , said that Mrs. Norton had received a " kinder prophecy like " that something was sure to happen this night , the first of March . Something , uh , final ? Nope . " It ai n't the eighth . " He pursued further the matter of Mrs. Norton 's talents , seeking skepticism , but saw clearly that Clara was impressed by them , thought Eleanor " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had brought them all , each with his different gifts , together . " She 's been a great comfort to me , Mr. Miller , and she 's taught me more about the Holy Bible than I ever knowed before . " He wondered if she 'd changed her mind about the Second Coming , but before he could ask , she was gone , trotting away from him as abruptly as she had come , her feet broad and knobby in the white pumps . Marcella stood at his side , and in the moment they had together he asked her what exactly they were expecting tonight . " I do n't know , " she said . " Perhaps . . . the coming of light . " Was that irony he heard ? Was she , like him , having fun with all this ? He wished to know what she meant , but feared to risk too much . Instead , he asked her why she had told him that tonight 's password was designed " to keep out the Baxters . " Did Abner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's the one who hates Mrs. Collins . He 's the man who turned all her friends against her and made his own wife the president of Mrs. Collins ' Evening Circle . " " Was he here on the eighth ? " " Yes . He 's a fat man with red hair and a furious temper . " She made funny puffing gestures of fatness and fury . " He made everybodywalk out and leave her alone . He 's with the enemy . " " The enemy ? Who are they ? " " Why , " she said with a smile , as though surprised he should ask , " the powers of darkness . " He smiled in return , but it made her stop smiling , and that confusedhim . " Do n't you think it 's kind of funny , " he said to cover for his smile , " that a redheaded preacher should be the devil 's advo-cate ? " " If you saw him , you would n't think so , " she said , and there was no smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become engrossed in a quiet argument about religion . Colin Meredith , severed , walked over to join him and Marcella . Affected , the boy 's walk , but not effeminate exactly . The nice child , the ever-willing friend , the shy young man who would fade into the shy old bachelor , fastidious , moody , kindly , especially toward small children . He explained that he had known Mrs. Norton for several months , that she had been helping him establish contact with superior spirits . He had introduced his friend Carl Dean to her , and although Carl Dean was skeptical at first , they had both come to have a lot of faith in her . She was extremely sincere and intelligent and unselfish , and she had done a great deal for him , not so much yet for Carl Dean maybe , but she had made a whole new person out of him , leading him away from the love of earthly things to love of things of the spirit . He had brought an end to all his bad habits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of communication with the other world . Well , maybe not exactly a communication , but something very much like it . It took literally hours and hours of meditation and humility and selfsearchingand seeking without thought , but once in awhile something happened , something really unbelievable , it was like  --  like a light turning on inside . Afterwards , after this kind of terribly exhilarating experience , he could n't explain it , or even describe it , it was beyond the capacity of human language , like Mrs. Norton always said . But , really , it was wonderful , a truly extraordinary experience  --  but then , Mr. Miller probably already knew what he meant . Beside him ,  |p198Marcella  nodded for him ; she seemed pretty caught up in what this silly kid had to say . Also , Meredith said , he sometimes received  --  like Mrs. Norton , through his right hand  --  messages from his dead mother and father , but that was mainly thanks to another woman he had known a couple years before in the orphanage ; Mrs. Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , though of course she said they were surely true . She herself , she had told him , had received her very first communications from recently dead earth people , or spirits that assumed their parts . Now , with her help , he was learning how to achieve much greater things . Willie and Mabel Hall came over , disrupting the boy 's monologue . Marcella excused herself , left the room . " Well , as the Good Book says , " said Willie Hall , " the poor has good tidings preached to them ! ' " Hall looked at no one when he spoke , just gazed off and let fly . " You know the Bible well ? " Miller asked . " And somethin ' greater than the temple is here ! ' " Mabel Hall , though not too big , outweighed her husband by a good thirty pounds and had a couple inches on him , but Miller 's first-sight estimate of her as the muscled tyrant proved far from the case . She was as submissive as Willie was impulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , Mr. Hall , but what do you think is going to  --  ? " " As the Good Book says , Mr. Miller , in malice be ye babes , butin mind be men ! ' And many are called , but few are chosen ' ! " It was useless , so Miller gave it up . " Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong  --  " Marcella came in and announced that refreshments were ready . She smiled over at Miller , and he winked in return . Everyone stood and moved with polite gestures toward the dining room , sweeping Marcella in ahead of them . All but Giovanni , of course : he watched them exit , expressionless . His eyes were what you noticed : glittering , black , restless , the flesh around them sunken , making them seem to protrude abnormally . Miller held back , let the others go ahead , and he saw , as he 'd more or less anticipated , that Eleanor Norton was also delaying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dining room , she approached him . " I saw you were talking with Mrs. Collins . " " Yes , for a moment . I must say , she seems very impressed by you . She says you have been a great inspiration to her . "  |p199Mrs  . Norton sighed , absently rubbed a small medallion that hung from her neck on a chain . " She 's a sincere woman , Mr. Miller , but . . . a frightful amateur . " She smiled up at him , accepting the sympatheticsmile he returned her . " Tell me , " she continued without transition , " do you believe in communication with spiritual beings at higher levels ? " Marcella had explained enough of what had happened until now to prepare him somewhat for tonight 's experience , and he had even half expected this woman 's very question , yet when she put it directly to him , he discovered he did n't have an answer for it . He reached again for his cigarettes , checked himself just in time . Chatter trickled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed . " It 's a subject , " he managed finally , " in which I have long had a serious interest , Mrs. Norton . " " Good , " she said simply , apparently accepting that , lame as it was . " Oh dear , we really have so much to do ! " She focused on some great distance , sighed . " I do hope we shall be ready ! " He ventured : " For what , Mrs. Norton ? " All he had picked up so far was that she claimed to be able to receive messages , through writing and sometimes , in emergencies , through her voice , from superiorspirits , spirits at what she called " higher aspects of intensity , " and that now she had reached the seventh such aspect , perhaps the last , whence she received periodic communiques from a teacher known to her as " Domiron . " This Domiron presumably existed , not exactly in a different place or a different stellar system , but somehow in this same space , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter or something . " I do n't know , " she said slowly , after a pause . " I hope . . . " But her voice trailed off . She glanced at her watch , and he instinctively checked his : 8:50 . " Mr. Miller ? " She looked up at him . He guessed her eyes to be gray or gray-blue , though in this dull flickering light he could n't tell for sure . But they had that faded , indistinct , introspectivequality of gray eyes . " Do you believe that Giovanni Bruno was miraculously rescued from the coalmine disaster ? " " Yes , I do . " No more hesitations , boy . " I do n't . " " Really ? But  --  " " I am convinced , Mr. Miller  --  more than that : I have received specific information on the matter  --  Giovanni Bruno perished in that mine disaster ! " What could he say ? From over her small graying head , Giovannip200Bruno 's eyes shone at them , as though . .. as though he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ? " " His own mother has confirmed it . She said she saw him dead . And everyone has agreed on one thing : that this is a very different man now from the one they all knew as Giovanni Bruno . " " Then you think  --  ? " " Not think , Mr. Miller ! This kind of insight is never achieved by thinking ! " She seemed suddenly angry . He realized that , for all her modest manner , there was something ever seething underneath . She frowned , as a mother might at a forgetful child , then continued matter-of-factly : " Giovanni Bruno died and his body is now inhabited by a superior being . This is the meaning of the . . . the vision of the white bird . " At a loss , he replied , " I see , " and then , in the ensuing silence , added , " Well , I 'm certainly learning a great deal ! " She assented . " We all have much to learn , " she said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperation , a pause . " We felt extremely fortunate that Mrs. Collins joined us three weeks ago . There is every reason to believe that the . . . the being , let us say , the being now struggling to establish communication with us through . . . through the body and person of Giovanni Bruno "  --  a thoughtfulhesitation , a brief glance Bruno 's way  --  " might originally have intended to utilize Mrs. Collins ' husband . " " But why do you think  --  ? " " The . . . the condition . . . " " Ah . And does Mrs. Collins herself . . . " Again the impatient sigh . " Grasp it ? I do n't know , Mr. Miller . I hope so . But she is slow to learn , is overemotional and impulsive . And she is too hemmed in , I am afraid , by her own . . . her own prejudices , if I may so speak . " " Her Christianity . " " Yes . I have had to employ all the frightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order even to communicate  --  I hope I do n't offend you . . . ? " " Not at all . " " Righteousness and salvation , the so-called Second Coming , the terribly overworked parable of the Cross , angels and devils and sin  --  sin ! Good heavens ! Finally , Mr. Miller , we are all of us emanations of the world soul , are we not ? Ultimately we all partake , like it or not , in what is commonly called the divine , and the only conceivable sinp202in such a case is to be willfully ignorant of one 's proper condition . Is n't that so ? " He assented , remarking privately that that was not unlike the line by which he often made out with the reluctant . " But what can I do ? And I simply can not share  --  that is , we cannotshare  --  her morbid expectations . I admit , it is possible , at least another thing somewhat like the disaster she expects is possible , but , well , there is a logic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think ? " " By all means . " " I have received no single message to confirm such an extreme interpretation , though it is true , there have been hints implying somethingof cosmic importance . . . . " She gazed off , her mind momentarilyelsewhere , bit her lip . She seldom let go her grip on the medallion . " Mr. Miller , I can not believe that my . . . my sources . . . " " Domiron , I think you  --  " " Why , yes ! How did you know ? " He perceived an answer that would really bowl her over , but he passed it by . " Marcella mentioned . . " " Oh , yes . Of course . " She looked up at Miller , her schoolmistress sternness melting for a moment . " She 's a truly marvelous pupil , so kind and sincere , the finest in all my years as . . . as a teacher . We 're deeply fond of her , Wylie and I. And she is making such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " She 's a wonderful girl . " " Yes , yes , she is . " Fadeout again . " Mrs. Norton , I 'd like to arrange for , sometime at your convenience , of course , some private instruction , too , if I may . " " Of course , Mr. Miller , " she said , then added gravely , " It is my duty for those who ask . " She cast a glance toward Bruno , then turned to enter the dining room . " Oh , and Mrs. Norton , what do you think , what do you believe Giovanni Bruno  --  or the voice within him  --  meant by the coming of light ' ? " " I 'm not sure , " she said , looking at him quizzically . " But we shall know tonight . Should n't we go in ? I 'm afraid there 'll be no cake for us . " The coming of light ! Do none of them perceive it so well as she ? So plain ! Her knife licks into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the frosting 's glaze , spoons reflect it , eyes sparkle with it ,  |p202light  decorates her laughter , her motions flow in it . Are not their pasts so shadowed as hers ? Does not a storm blow through their present ? Do not their morrows flash with promise ? Is not this very room burstingwith light ? Are they blind ? Are they all so old ? Need they their terrors ? Must they distort it ? Oh , come ! she cries . Yes , there is plenty for all ! for seconds ! take more ! Gaily , she serves , pours , helps , hands , gives . . . gives ! Around the table a cheerful tumble of voices , forks clicking plates , compliments on the cake , modest pasts in halting revelation , the boys talking basketball and animal care with Wylie Norton : could be a party anywhere . Willie Hall , his jaws in motion as always , but now with cake damming the sound , listened , eyes asquint , to Eleanor Norton . Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nibbling at the cake , Mrs. Hall whispering furtively into Mrs. Wilson 's ear . Miller located Marcella behind the broad shoulders of Clara Collins , delivering cake to Elaine . He maneuvered so as to catch her eye , showed her his empty hands . She smiled , stretched over the dining room table , starched blouse snapping taut , under the yellow  --  almost amber  --  glow of the chandelier , sliced him a wide wedge , laid it neatly on a plate . He knew it was unwarranted , but he could n't rid his mind of the idea she had baked the cake especially for him . Anyway , why not think of it that way ? Watching her was a feast in itself . More than anything , it was her poise , her unfailing delicacy of movement , her radiance , open smiles , frank gazes , all without visible effort , operating on some internal principle of  --  well , he was tempted to say Joy . But maybe that was merely an instance of transference . Certainly he felt like blowing the goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee . " I do n't suppose you take cream or sugar . " " No . " He smiled , a little surprised at the way she 'd said it . He could hear some thin music trickling in from the television . He motionedtoward it . " We ca n't escape it , should we join it ? " Wanted it to sound natural , but it did n't : could almost feel the goddamn whiskers sprouting and bristling . He expected the worst . But she smiled and said , " Okay . Let me get some coffee . " In the darkened living room , they leaned back against a wall , just inside the door to the dining room , facing the television set . Her father sagged in his chair between them and the screen , his back more or less to them , snorted restlessly from time to time , ran his old white hands trembling through his thinning hair . There was no bandage onp203his nose tonight , and the large sores showed black when they caught the bluish-white glare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the clasp on Marcella 's head . He could n't distinguish the outlines of the televised picture exactly , but the motion of the screen was reflected in it . Nervous back-and-forth twitches of light . Her hair had a fresh smell that reminded him vaguely of some distant event , something beyond his mere recollections , some fragrant imprecise time he had possibly never really known . A lock of her hair had come loose from the clasp , arched out now over her smooth forehead . She looked up and , not smiling , held his gaze . He lowered the cup . A strange thought intrudedand he wondered where it came from and if it were truly a thought or already an irrevocable decision . She had large wideset sensitive eyes , he knew them to be brown , a small fine-boned  --  and , in sudden need , their mouths drew together , he felt her warm breath flickering over his lips just before they touched hers  --  and it was only a touch , a brush : plain unskilled reception , and he thought , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze as he leaned away and they were both still for a moment . Then she smiled . Her smile broke the last bolts . He watched her dancing through his once-gloomy house . " Here , " she whispered , and took the plate out of his hand , set it on a table a few feet away , put her cup there , too , returned to his side . She took his free hand , clasped it firmly but not in ownership exactly , a kind of eager gratitude , affirmation , and she leaned against him . He knelt , set the cup on the floor , lifted his eyes the full length of her young body , all those subtle curves of thigh and belly , and as he rose to  --  he thought coolly  --  enrich her experience , the doorbell sounded . He started , and she laughed gaily . " Excuse me , " she said , and her amused smile tweaked him faintly . " You giddy adolescent ass ! " he accused himself as she walked away , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been so wildly high ! When Marcella came back in , she was with Ralph Himebaugh ! Miller almost laughed aloud . What a night ! Himebaugh ! Ralph did n't see him at first , kept his coat on , fur cap in hand , peered anxiously into the shadowed corners , blinked , twisted his cap , man being chased , nodded at old Antonio in the chair , who of course ignored the newest intruder as he had ignored them all , bumped into Marcellawho had paused , squinted at the television as though seeking a clue there , eyes flicked across Miller , frowned toward the lighted dining room and its noises , whipped back on Miller , and he stopped dead in his tracks . " Evening , Ralph , " said Miller , smiling.  | " My God ! " stammered Ralph . " M-Miller , you  --  ? Is that  --  ? What  --  My heavens , what 's happening ? " " I do n't know , Ralph . It 's not certain . Step in and have some cake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his goddamn face ; hoped it looked like welcome only . Himebaugh finally summoned the will to take another step , squinted anxiously over his shoulder once more at the old man , then again at Miller , hurried on at last into the dining room , still twistinghell out of his cap . Miller hoped Marcella would linger behind , but of course she did n't , so he picked up his cup from the floor and followed them in . What the hell , he reasoned , there would be time now . Do n't push it . Himebaugh was introduced to all present and , in snatches , to the general purpose of the congregation . He seemed dazed , eyes dilated still from the dark walk over , ears bright red from the cold , flabby old lips moving foolishly , unable to understand the whirl around him . A lot of commotion , as a matter of fact , in spite of the group 's professedcaution . Miller did n't quite understand it himself . Ralph stammeredsomething inanely aimless about a will , finally blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is to say , only a routine visit , in order to discuss his , er , his , let us say , press releases ( hopeful glance at Miller ) , how 's that ? Vision ? Yes , his vision , and chose tonightby merest accident , well , not by merest accident , but he had had no idea , none at all , that there would be , that so many people , that is to say , and he almost turned back because of the snowstorm . He removed his coat , gave it to Marcella without even observing who took it , unlocked the fur cap from his hands and thrust that at her , too . She left the room with them . Himebaugh accepted a cup of coffee , turned down the cake . Miller turned to pursue Marcella into the privacy of the hallway , but Eleanor Norton intercepted him . Her face had paled , her eyes were pinched from below with anxiety , a kind of horror or foreboding . Perspiration on her forehead . Miller assumed concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Norton looked up at the two of them , first at one , then at the other . " Do n't you see ? " she whispered . " He is the twelfth ! The circle is complete ! " And she moved away again , spreading the word . An uneasy silence sank into the room . Himebaugh plunked three or four spoonfuls of sugar into his coffee , stirred , spoon scraping the china . His hands trembled . Everyone watched . He glanced aroundp205anxiously at all the eyes as he sipped the coffee , his dark shaggy eyebrowsarched up at the middle , asking What ? What ? his eyes popping with shock . Since a boy in school , Miller had known the old guy but had never seen him in this light . And in this snowstorm , with nothing to go on  --  Alongside Miller , Clara Collins , breathing noisily , clenched and unclenched her fists . " Perhaps , " announced Eleanor Norton ominously , " we should return to Mr. Bruno 's room . " Miller could hear , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinny shouts of mock anger , soul-legend of the nation , and then the clanging voice of an announcer telling where good tobaccos come from . It was probably permitted to smoke out here , and he 'd forgot . Marcella was cleaning off the table . He asked her softly what Eleanor had meant by " completing the circle . " Marcella thought a moment , then said , " Well , there were six of us before , not counting Giovanni , and we were all supposed to bring somebody tonight . But Mrs. Wilson 's guest could n't come because of the bad weather or something . " She smiled up at him , returned to stacking plates . He started to help , but she shook her head , nodded toward the bedroom . " I 'll be there in a minute , " she said . She carried the plates into the kitchen , and Miller took advantage of his momentary solitude to enjoy a prolonged unobserved regard of the easy cadence of her hips . Where Happy Bottom pinched in at the waist , bulged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly . There was a conscious challenge , a proud taunting thrust to Happy Bottom 's stagy shamble ; Marcella swung looselimbedand light of heart , stunning but chaste . Difference between a hurdy-gurdy and a pipe 's soft capriccio . But he liked both . He was the last but for Marcella into the bedroom . Wylie Norton eased the door shut behind him . It was 10:45 . Eleanor Norton posed priestesslike at the foot of Bruno 's bed . Bruno sat as he had sat before , staring out straight in front of him , and thus , as she had planned it , at Mrs. Norton ; his dark scooped-out eyes , though , now seemed blank and unseeing . Worn out probably . The others gathered around his bed : Wylie , Clara , young Meredith , the Halls , Betty Wilson . Marcellaentered quietly . She touched Giovanni 's head , measured some medicine in a teaspoon , offered it to her brother , who accepted it without expression . Carl Dean Palmers and Elaine Collins hung back slightly , she in shyness , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the coffee , tiptoed over beside Miller . He was breathing rapidly , abjectly terrified . The cup rattled on its saucer . Hisp206eyes blinked with a kind of nervous tic . " Wh-what for God 's sake is it ? " he rasped . " Relax , " Miller whispered . " Watch and see . " He nodded toward Eleanor Norton . Mrs. Norton now lifted her slender arms slowly before her , a kind of benediction , as it were . He understood well enough her task : she had called this thing and was under pressure to produce ; if she did n't , she 'd likely lose the mace . " Hark ye to the White Bird ! " she commanded , shattering the silence and causing some to start . Himebaugh caught his breath sharply . " Giovanni Bruno ! The One to Come ! " The widows and Mrs. Hall whispered mewing amens . " We look to the east ! We look to the west ! The feet tug downward , but the spirit soars ! " She had a fine voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A cosmic repose ! Hark ye ! We avoid the illusory to seek wisdom with love ! For a time , we know , is to come , and the soul will swim in the vast and empty sea of enlightenment ! " Betty Wilson had begun to whimper softly . Elaine and Carl Dean had joined the group at the bed . Slowly , Himebaugh edged away from Miller 's side toward the others . " So hark ye , hark ye to the White Bird of wisdom and grace ! " At this familiar angelus all the Nazarenes , in Pavlovian response , amenned . " From out of the abyss of darkness , lead us to light ! " Colin Meredith caught his breath . He opened his mouth as though to speak , but nothing came out . Instead , it was Clara Collins who cried out , " Hear us , oh God ! " " In the name of Christ Jesus ! " added Willie Hall as though reciting , apparently emboldened by Clara 's cry . " As it says  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her voice pitched up a notch . Clara , undaunted , or maybe ignorant of the other woman 's meaning , opened her mouth to speak again , but just then Giovanni Bruno lifted one hand and brought a sudden hush down on all of them . They waited . " The tomb . . . " he said , and it was weird how the sound emerged as though forged in some inner and deeply resonant cavity , then heaved whole through his open but utterly passive mouth , " . . . is its message ! " Hand down . Message , tomb : all eyes turned on Clara Collins . " Oh God ! " she screamed , thrusting high her husband 's note . " The Day of the Lord is at hand ! " Betty Wilson bubbled into tears , plumped to her waddy knees , commenced to pray wildly . Eleanor Norton had paled , seemed con/fused , unbelieving : betrayed . Wylie watched her . Himebaugh , beside himself with panic , shrank back , found Miller 's side . " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Lord ! " chorused Willie Hall . His wife sank apprehensively to Betty Wilson 's side , and Elaine Collins knelt dutifully behind them . They chanted amens and their voices rose , and now the boys joined in . " We must walk with God and believe ! " cried Clara . " We must listen always to the white bird in our hearts ! Abide in grace ! The Son of God , He is comin ' ! We will stand  --  " " Caution ! " cried Eleanor Norton with tremendous power . Even though he 'd been expecting it , having realized that Clara was quoting her husband 's message and was now nearing the controversialphrase about the eighth of the month , nevertheless , like everyone else , Miller started . Clara stood transfixed before the other woman 's intensity . Betty Wilson began to whimper again , and Clara shushed her . Silence , troubled and fearful , settled , out of which the heavy breathing emerged like an invisible animal . Miller , seeking concealment , too tall to stand alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and edged back into it . Himebaugh stood marooned in the room 's middle . The poor sonuvabitch , Miller knew how he felt and supposed he could rescue him , but was having too goddamned good a time to want to break the spell . Jesus ! Lou Jones should be here ! He 'd love it ! " Mrs. Norton , " said Clara submissively , almost tenderly , " lead us to light ! " Eleanor turned stiffly to the chair at the foot of the bed , slowly sat down upon it . Wylie watched , frowning worriedly . No one talked . All looked on . Mrs. Norton stretched her arms forward . She placed her hands on the table , palms down , thumbs touching , fingers spread apart . She stared , breathless , at the opposite wall , and for several tense minutes nothing happened . Then , slowly , almost imperceptibly at first , her lips began to move . There was no sound except for a little hissing noise that came from them . Then it stopped . Her lips closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . The candlelight beamed off her gold medallion like a tiny sun trembling there on her dark dress . Her mouth fell open and a strange almost masculine voice emerged . Her lips closed down around the sound , almost a gargling , and produced : " Hark ye to the new voice among ye ! "  |p208The  invisible animal gasped . Eyes turned . Himebaugh came into focus . Miller leaned forward in his chair , pressing his cheeks into the palms of his hands , his hands in a kind of prayer position . A laugh leaped in his diaphragm , but he was now Ralph 's backdrop , the eyes on Ralph saw him , so he managed to keep his face poker-stiff . Himebaugh , the poor fucker , literally shook . His body seemed to shrink , his clothes to bag . His cup tinkled in its saucer . Eleanor Norton collapsedon the tabletop . A great act , but  --  Miller glanced quickly at the other faces  --  was he the only one who knew she had failed ? Wylie stepped over , patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back over his shoulder at Himebaugh . Marcella stood , pressed against the wall at the head of her brother 's bed . Now , for the first time , she saw Miller again , and as though in imitation of him , she brought her hands together before her face . Her eyes sparkled . . . goddamn it , were there tears ? " I came , " said Himebaugh suddenly , his precisely mannered voice now half growl , half squeak , " if you must know "  --  he swallowed  --  " in fear of . . . of the destroyer ! " " Oh dear Jesus ! " wailed Clara Collins , and dropped like a brick ' to her knobby knees : kawhump ! Again the Nazarenes took over . Christ , they were irrepressible ! Miller had to admit , though , that Himebaugh had , under the circumstances , performed well . Eleanor Norton came around , opened her eyes , appeared lost . " Mrs. Collins ! " she appealed , stumbling over to her . " Come ! Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room , apparently eager to learn , but effectively  --  at last  --  breaking up the revival meeting . The two boys began to argue quietly , Wylie engaged Willie Hall in talk , and with these distractions the rest of the Nazarenes lost their zeal . Soon the room was full of chatter and motion again , and Miller felt free to leave his lair . He slipped quietly from group to group . Everyone had his own opinion about the meaning of events . Wylie Norton seemed upset , but Miller could n't pin him down on anything . Norton was a heavy sadeyedfellow with glasses on the end of his nose , so suppressed and polite a voice one had to lean far forward to understand him . Willie Hall quoted the Bible irrelevantly , seemed to have seen nothing that happened , proved to be little more than a desensitized loudspeaker , emitting endless textual nonsense from his self-enclosed inner world . Miller guessed that nothing in the world would really surprise the man . Mrs. Norton returned , sought written explication from Domiron ,  |p209but  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrank to a corner and stared at Bruno . Miller wondered at the message , socalled , with which Bruno had so dramatically torched the meeting . The tomb is its message . Meaningless , yet loaded . He remembered that tomb was probably the word that rhymed with womb in Bruno 's lost poem , Bonali had finally remembered that much . Had Bruno really had Ely Collins ' deathnote in mind , though , as everyone assumed ? Miller doubted the guy even understood there was such a note , wondered if he even grasped the brute fact of Collins ' death . Then , what was he getting at ? If the guy were rational , he might have been responding to the night 's question : What is the meaning of " the coming of light ? " with the answer : Death ; or : Christ 's resurrection . But was Giovanni Bruno in any sense rational ? Miller frankly thought not , not from what he 'd seen so far . No , the more likely explanation was that he had heard something more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here tonight , and had produced his own abbreviatedparaphrase . Miller decided he would spend some time with Mrs. Norton 's logs as soon as possible . The two widows discussed Bruno 's grace with Mabel Hall . Clara insisted that God was indeed speaking through him  --  " The Spirit has took on flesh ! "  --  and the others , though eyeing him uneasily , had to agree : it all seemed to fit , just like Ely had said . Colin Meredith was sniffling , his long-lashed eyes damp and reddened , and Carl Dean Palmers seemed irritated with him , looked embarrassed when Miller passed by . He ducked his head from the others and whispered , " I do n't see it , Mr. Miller . They 're making a lot outa nothing . " Restlessness grew , more shifting between groups . Something unimaginablewas to have happened by midnight , and now only some twenty minutes or so remained . Miller joined Marcella near her brother , but before he could ask her , she asked him . He said he did n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norton sat studying her logbook . Miller supposed she was preparing now to find the buffer message to explain why the undefined event did not occur , or how it did take place but was not properly grasped by all . Marcella , beside him , spooned more medicine into her brother . Miller 's main wish now was to have another moment alone with her before the night 's program was over . He watched her bent back , fascinated by the narrowness of the white blouse on her shoulders and the single starched pleat , now opening down her back as though to smile . He felt he was at the brink of some fundamental change , and , strangely enough , he welcomed the sensation . Bruno himself was ob/viously exhausted . His long high-domed face , gleaming with a clammy perspiration , sagged , and he slumped lower and lower into the pillows . A feverish glow still lit his eyes , but his day was just about done . As Marcella leaned back to cap the medicine bottle , the curve of her hip bumped Miller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All started , stood , stiffened . Anxious glances , eyes agog . Short breaths . Frowns . Was this it ? " Mama , " Marcella explained . " She 's come down to turn off the television . " Everyone relaxed some . Miller longed for a smoke . Soon . He considered that it was curious Bruno 's parents did not participate here . Just too old , probably . Carl Dean sighed , an undisguised protest  --  and then the whole house was rent with a terrible throaty scream ! For a moment , in group terror , no one moved . Then , almost simultaneously , Miller and Marcella turned and ran for the door , then on through the dining room to the front room . In confusion and with frightened shouts , the others stumbled and clatteredbehind . The living room was dark , as before , but for the television screen . There , a man on a dark horse pulled a kerchief up over his mouth , turned to his two companions and said , " There he comes ! " Emilia Bruno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the television sat Antonio Bruno . He was dead . Lights came on . People cried , " What is it ? " Miller heard himself explaining it . It was Clara Collins who first lost control . She fell in a kind of sobbing fit to the floor , calling out her dead husband 's name . Elaine started bawling . Others cried then , kept shouting , hurrying in , hurrying out . Marcella , in tears , ran back to her brother 's room . Millertrailed a short distance behind , arrived to find her weeping quietly on the edge of the bed . " Go with Mama , " Giovanni whispered , his plain voice altogether unlike that which had uttered the message . His eyes were perhaps a little wider awake , but otherwise he was the same as before . Miller stood unobtrusively in the shadows by the door . Marcella passed him on the way out , but did n't see him through her tears . Bruno stared at nothing . Was he smiling ? In the dining room , Carl Dean was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this d-do n't beat all ! " Colin said , " I told you so ! I told you so , Carl Dean ! " They were both very white . On a chair , Betty Wilson slumped waddily . " Oh my God ! " she whimpered softly . " I did n't think it 'd be like this ! "  |p211Ral|ph  Himebaugh and the Nortons stood in the dining room on the other side of the table from Miller . He could still hear Emilia Bruno and Clara Collins keeping it up in the living room , and it looked like the Halls were in there , too . Eleanor Norton held her small face in her hands , gazed upward toward the cut-glass chandelier . For some reason , people all turned toward her . Well , had she not , by calling this meeting tonight , prophesied its denouement ? Marcella , her face streaked with tears , but outwardly calm and protective , led her old mother out of the front room , started toward the stairs in the kitchen with her , paused . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she weeping , he talking to himself . After a long while , Eleanor lowered her hands . " Death as a sign , " she said gravely , her voice breaking , seeming very old , " can mean only one thing . " She hesitated , as though afraid to continue . A small sob caught in her chest . " The end of the world ! " " Oh no ! " cried Himebaugh . " I  --  I thought so ! I knew it ! It 's what I thought all the time ! It 's why I came ! " Clara Collins stood , shaken , big square-jawed face wet with tears , hair snarled , heavy mouth agape , in the living room doorway . " Yes ! " she gasped . " The eighth of the month ! " Well , not the eighth , of course . Elan , Domiron , the One to Come , and time itself soon took care of that . But the course was set . And Tiger Miller had his game . With the storm that hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first distinct rumors that Deepwater Number Nine was going to be closed down . As soon as the rumors started circulating , Vince Bonali knew , goddamn it , he wanted to go back down . If you were born to be a coalminer , there was no point in fighting fate . A kind of anxious humor swept around town . Everybody made a big joke about how bad the air was up on top and how when they took baths these days they felt like they were wasting water . And then on Monday , the second , old Sal Ferrero slipped on the ice in front of hisp212house and broke his arm , and that got everybody cracking how they wanted to get back down in the goddamn mine where it was safe . So , as soon as the roads were cleared , Vince drove around to a few of the mines in neighboring counties . He put in his chit with the offices , looked up relatives , chewed over the situation with union bosses , but it was anything but encouraging . Got an earful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helluva lot of other guys out of work , just like himself . Bad as it was , though , he discovered that at least a half dozen guys from Number Nine had got on at other mines : goddamnit , he had started too late ! Too late ! All day , the old car lapped up the long stretches of greasy asphalt , and all for nothing . Passed a lot of strip mines along the way , whited over with snow , and they depressed him all the more . Not only fucked up the countryside , but they meant fewer jobs , too , and jobs he did n't know how to handle . And now all this talk about gasificationof coal beds  --  he swore and slapped the steering wheel . " Come on , God ! Get me outa this one ! " he said out loud . Vince had always imagined God as a tough dark old bastard who lived a good ways off , but had a long rubbery arm , spoke street Italian , gave the sonsabitchestheir due , and for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision had n't changed much , except he was beginning to suspect God maybe had come to lump him in with the sonsabitches . Talking to God made him recollect the joke or something he 'd been hearing around town about the end of the world or an invasion from Mars or some goddamn calamity due up next weekend . Boy ! what was the matter with this town ? As far as he could make out , it had something to do with that nut Bruno again , or maybe it was just that everybody assumed it . Well , that just went to show what a smart cookie that Father Baglione was . Bonali had never given the old priest too much credit , but a couple months ago when all the old gossips at the church had wanted to canonize the guy because of his so-called visitation , the old man had just chewed his cigar and kept his peace . From what Etta had found out , it was n't long before these same old women were getting shunted out of Bruno 's hospital room and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the end of the world ! Man , what next ? Well , what the hell , maybe it was n't a bad idea at that  --  might be a relief to have done with this moronic business once and for all . He laughed at the idea of the world going up in a puff of smoke . Then he remembered he was n't ready , saw again the unblinkingstare of Pooch Minicucci 's old lady . Sunday , for sure , he wasp213going to keep his resolution and tag along with Angie and Etta to Mass , get himself on the right team again . At home , beat down and depressed , he dropped into a chair facing the TV . It was off , but he did n't feel like turning it on . Etta came in and sat down on the sofa near him . The fatness and silence of her presence irritated him all the more , but , hell , she did n't have it easy either . He got to talking out loud , said the way things were going , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirtieth anniversary for them this year , did it ? and how he figured they were really done for . Why was it turning out like this ? Thank God , they still had the old house , but , shit , they 'd probably have to mortgage that , too . And then , all of a sudden , he saw Etta was crying . He got half out of his chair , took her hand , said not to cry like that , he was just mouthing off , hell , things 'd work out , they always did . But she handed him a letter . He glanced at the envelope : from their oldest boy , Vince Junior . He was working out on the Coast , worked on airplanes . Vince supposedsomething terrible must have happened , one of the grandkids or something , and , Jesus , just now  --  ! He was almost crying and he hated to look inside . But when he opened it , there was a nice friendly letter and scribblings from the grandkids and a check for $300 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , what with the mines closed down , and , since he had a little extra , he was sending it along , keep beer in the icebox and Angie in pretty clothes , and so on , have a happy anniversary , and to let him know if they needed more . " Jesus , Etta , " Vince said . " That sure was nice of Junior , was n't it ? " And he got out his handkerchief and blew his nose . Vince had always gagged along with the rest about getting old , but nowadays he found it hard to smile , found that cracks about his fifty years only made his stomach turn . Could n't land a new job and he began to see it would n't even be easy to get on at the mines now . Trouble was , though he had n't wanted to admit it before , people hardly ever hired a new man old as Vince was . He could do the work of five or six young guys , understand , especially in the mines , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted these days , but , hell , it still did n't matter . It was just the dumb attitude these people doing the hiring took . Vince hated even to look into a mirror . A thick gray depression was crowding down all over him . One Tuesday at Wanda 's  --  he 'd fallen into the consoling habit of passing afterdark Tuesdays there  --  when there was n't much to dop214but talk , he tried to explain it . He had been feeling his goddamn half century all day , and now , mainly because before coming over he had got a little too tanked up at the Eagles , he could n't seem to stiffen the old pecker up enough to get the trick done , and that made him all the more miserable . " Wanda , I have to tell you , I 'm getting old , " he confessed simply . He was goddamn sorrowful . The hall light was on , just outside the bedroom door , and it spread a harsh sallow glare over their side-by-side bellies . " It sure is somethin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sounded worn out . Life was no picnic for her either , goddamn it . " It sure is a tough solution to worry about . I just do n't know what the hell I 'm gon na do . " His tongue was thick . Room was slipping a little toward the left . And he 'd never felt so weak and shriveled . " The future looks to me just like a big goddamn empty hole , Wanda . " She yawned . Her breasts filled up a little , and then slid off to each side again like wobbly little airbubbles . Then she giggled . " No , listen ! I mean it , Wanda ! What 's gon na come of me ? " There was a long idiot span of silence , filled only by the squeaky sucking noises that the baby in the crib at the foot of their bed was making on his bottle . Wanda dug at one ear with her finger . The coarse pale hairs of her crotch poked up like dry weeds , pitched long sharp shadows across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . And finally she said , " Vince , hon , d' you believe in talkin ' with spirits ? " What does it matter that secrecy has been decreed ? the Spirit is made manifest by signs . Else , how account for the uprooting of the widow Mrs. Wilson 's hollyhocks , excrement on her front porch , a signature from the " Black Hand " ? Or the theft of the widow Mrs. Lawson 's porch swing , the dead rat left on her window ledge ? The inexplicable death of the coalminer Mr. Hall 's young bird dog ? The town veterinarian Dr. Norton diagnoses : internal bleeding . Or how explain the suddenly fierce gossip of the dour old women in the nave of St. Stephen 's ? " Fatti del diavolo ! " Or the revival of St. Peter gagsp215in clubs and bars and on church lawns Sundays ? Or the excited nonsenseof boys in high school locker rooms ? " Gee whiz ! the end of the world already , and me almost a virgin still ! " How else shed light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalminer Mr. Bruno ? the appearance in the city newspaper of strange tales of medieval seers and wizards ? the inflamed preachments against heresy from the pulpit of the Church of the Nazarene ? Or who can say why else this town 's collective fate darkens so ? The last of the area mines seems sure to close . The streets of the business sector grow desolate . Glumly , the shopowners visit each other . The mayor declares a one-month moratorium on parking meters to encourage downtown trade . The winter is bitter and long . The families of ninety-seven dead coalminers huddle around old habits , their empty futures hovering like birds of prey . Some marry again , some leave . Most wait , not knowing for what . Young people desert , breaking up families . A motel closes . The basketball team loses . A strange virus cripples half the community . The whole town seems to age overnight . Children grow rebellious . TV reception is often bad . A dance at the Eagles is canceled . People die . The rate of harassment crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opinions vary . Italians , including the Police Chief Dee Romano , fear the revival of old blood enmities , of old extortions and death by night , but , strangely , few Italians are struck . Some blame out-of-towners , even rival cities . Others the Klan . A maniac . Communists . The mayor recognizes the adolescent style : some high school prankster . Coalminers observe uncomfortably that the victims are usually coalminers or their families . Not even widows in mourning are exempted . The Nazarene pastor Reverend Baxter , his own congregationoften the prey , passes thundering judgment upon false prophets and apostates who , with their black signature and foul deeds , confess their allegiance to the Devil . " These here people they are murmurers ! they are malcontents ! they are walking after their own lusts ! ungodly folks turning the great grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying our only Master and Lord , Christ Jesus ! These here people , I tell ye even weeping , they are the enemy of the cross of Jesus ! Their end it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do glory in their shame ! " Rumors of Black Masses . Actually , a clandestine high school club or gang , not just a singlep216boy , the mayor explains to a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce board members . The schoolteacher Mrs. Norton attributes the attacks to " the powersof darkness , " and when the widow Mrs. Collins contends it can only be the work of " Baxter 's people , " Mrs. Norton reminds her that the specific agents utilized by the dark powers are less significant than a recognition of the existence and activity of the powers themselves . To friends in private , Mrs. Collins admits frankly that she does n't understand what Mrs. Norton means , and she sits up nights hoping to catch one of the " people " redhanded and prove her point . The mayor announces in the city newspaper , the West Condon Chronicle , that the frequency of the recent " Black Hand " incidents makes it clear that it has become a new teen-age fad , a game , and he asks cooperation from all parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proving the mayor a prophet if not a consummateanalyst , and culminates with a " Black Hand Blast " up at the youth center , which is converted at the last moment by the adult supervisors into a " Black Magic Party , " and , as usual , is not much of a success . " Black Hand " phonecalls tie up the circuits , and letters from same arrive daily at the newspaper office , city hall , private homes . When the newspaper releases the report of two other signatures , the " Black Peter " and the " Black Piggy , " it sets off a rash of new calls and letters , etc. , by everything from the " Blackhead " to the " Black Bottom . " " The Black Maria . " " The Blackboard . " " The Black Widow . " " The Blackball . " " The Black Armpit . " Yes , the mayor admits with a rueful sigh when the suggestion is put to him by several civic leaders : it is really a reflection of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time contributingto it . A community-wide moral problem . Monstrous . A cancer . Something has to be done , says one . The mayor agrees . A little common sense , says another . At the city hospital , a nurse , idle , picks up the telephone , waggles it indecisively in her hand a moment , glances down the empty corridor , sighs , finally dials a number . " West Condon Chronicle . " " Is Mr. Miller there , please ? " " Whom shall I say is calling ? " " The Black Hand . "  | " Hello ? " " Just  --  just a moment , please . " Clump clump clump . " ( Mr. Miller ! it 's some woman says she 's the Black Hand ! ' " " Hello , Miller here . " " This is the Black Hand . " " Hello there , Black . What a nice voice you have . " " Do you know why my hand is black ? " " No , why ? " Scratch . ( Lighting a smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of light . " " That 's reasonable . " " But what is light ? " " I wish I knew .

" She rubs her nose to block a sniffle . " My whole me is going black ! " She swallows . Do n't get sappy . His easy laughter trickles through the wires , makes her relax again . Anyway , she has n't made him mad . " I 'm sorry , Happy . But what more can I tell you ? I 'm up to my ears in this goddamn project and it just does n't give me a minute . " " Is it about these people who think the Last Judgment is about to happen ? " " How do you know about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to find out . One of my hernia patients told me all about it .
