Dr. Charles McGrath 's study . At stage right is the Doctor 's desk , which looks like that of a business executive . An easy chair for visitors faces it at an angle to the audience , so that any body sitting in it can be seen three-quarters face . Very far to stage left is a closed door . The back wall is lined with bookcases , containing , on the right , darkly bound theological works and , to the left , contemporary books , mostly with their dust jackets still on . Above these bookcases , leaning against the wall , are photographs of energetic modern divines whom Dr. McGrath admires and old prints of leaders of the Reformation . The wall on the left is bare , but has a window with old-fashioned square panes . Several of these panes have been broken as well as part of the frame between them , as if by a heavy stoning . Dr. McGrath is sitting at his desk , with an open Bible before him . He is a powerful-looking man in his forties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MCGRATH ( to himself , reading from Matthew 24 ) . " Watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come . " " But know this , that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come ( he looks up toward the door ) he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up . " ( He looks toward the window . ) Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh "  --  A knock at the door . McGrath looks up startled . p. 3 MCGRATH Yes ? A Servant enters . He is a slim , pale young man , with a pointed beard . JONATHAN There 's a Mr. Duquesne to see you , Doctor . MCGRATH Oh , yes . Ask him to come in here . The Servant goes out . McGrath puts a marker in the Bible and sets it aside ; then rather ostentatiously begins to write . Francis Duquesne comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin and sallow and dry , and he speaks with a faint French accent . He has left his hat and coat outside . McGrath gets up and shakes hands with him from behind the desk . DUQUESNE ( nodding toward the manuscript on the desk ) . Another sizzling sermon ? MCGRATH Sit down : I wanted to talk to you . DUQUESNE ( sitting down in the easy chair ) . Well , it 's ages since I 've seen you , Charley , though we 're almost neighbors . The last thing I heard about you was that you were going to Allensburg , Pennsylvania . The First Presbyterian Church , was n't it ? MCGRATH That did n't go through . DUQUESNE What a pity . MCGRATH It 's been a severe disappointment . p. 4 DUQUESNE What was the trouble ? MCGRATH I 'm not quite sure . I preached out there in October , and I know that I was very much wanted by the better elements in the congregation . I suspect that the Communists prevented it . DUQUESNE The Communists ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there go to church ? MCGRATH You never can tell nowadays . There are members of that congregation  --  even fairly well-to-do people  --  who refer to themselves as " liberals . " When I hear the word liberal now , I know there are Communists around . DUQUESNE All the liberals are n't by any means Communists . I suppose I 'm a liberal myself . And , Charley , I must say that any liberal might naturally be expected to object to the kind of sermons you 've been preaching . MCGRATH I have n't seen you in church . DUQUESNE I read about them in the papers . You 're getting a lot of publicity . MCGRATH Yes : I let the Communists have it . I have n't pulled any punches . In such a soft-headed community as this  --  where they do n't want to admit they 're menaced  --  I 'm bound to attract attention . p. 5 DUQUESNE Where do you see the menace ? MCGRATH Are you one of the softies , too ? Do n't you know that the Copperworkers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your evidence for that ? MCGRATH Their defiant attitude  --  the outrageous demands they 're making ! DUQUESNE All unions make demands . They do n't have to be Communists for that . Do you object on principle to organized labor ? MCGRATH I 've never known any good to come of it . DUQUESNE They often get better conditions . MCGRATH At the cost of being ruled by the Communists , and they 're made to turn their backs on religion . DUQUESNE A good many of these workers here are Catholics  --  Italians and Poles and so on . There are two Catholic churches in town , and both , I understand , are well filled . MCGRATH That means that those Polacks and Wops are enslaved to the Catholic Church . DUQUESNE To both Communism and the Catholic Church ? MCGRATH You have two conspiracies at work . I think they 've made a deal with one another . I give the Catholics a blast , too , from time to time . p. 6 DUQUESNE Of course , you know that the Catholic policy now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MCGRATH They 're trying to take us over . I believe that the Communists are behind the whole thing . Did n't Father Leary here come out for the copper-workers in the last strike ? Did n't Khrushchyov go to see the Pope ? DUQUESNE That was his son-in-law . MCGRATH It 's the same thing . DUQUESNE Look here , Charley : it may be that those elders in Allensburg  --  impressive , of course , though your sermons are  --  decided that you sometimes talked a little wildly . MCGRATH That 's always the accusation against a sincere reformer . DUQUESNE Well , people do n't always want such alarming invectives as you 've been giving them lately . They go to church to be edified and reassured . MCGRATH What I want to do is wake them up . DUQUESNE You want to make them unsure and uncomfortable the way the old preachers did , with their visions of damnation , of being roasted alive for eternity  --  when ministers like Jonathan Edwards sometimes scared his weaker sinners into suicide . p. 7 MCGRATH As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicidal . You ca n't temporize with Evil ! DUQUESNE But I 'm sure there are people like myself who wonder how a minister who calls himself a Christian can spend quite so much of his time preaching hatred and indignation . MCGRATH If you were an honest Christian  --  DUQUESNE I do n't call myself a Christian at all . MCGRATH Well , if you were one , you 'd feel indignation , too . Did n't Christ Himself say  --  DUQUESNE That he came not to bring peace but a sword . Jesus did have his militant moments ; but in general his doctrine was quite distinct from the policy of the more pugnacious Jews who had n't yet been intimidated by the Romans  --  that is , so far as it 's possible to tell . We really know very little about him . MCGRATH I suppose that by this time you 're one of those skeptics who claim that He never existed ! DUQUESNE Not at all . There 's no real way of proving it , but I think it 's impossible to doubt that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius  --  who inspired the Christian legend . MCGRATH Is that what you 're teaching them up there at the college ? p. 8 DUQUESNE What I give them is strictly factual  --  so far as one can know the facts . I do n't teach them any theology  --  except as doctrine that people are known to have believed . As for the divinity of Jesus , I let them make up their own minds . A knock at the door . MCGRATH Yes ? The Servant appears . MCGRATH Is it the man to fix the window ? JONATHAN No , Doctor . It 's your brother-in-law on the phone . MCGRATH Tell him I 'm busy just now . JONATHAN He wants to know if you 're coming out to your sister 's funeral . McGrath reaches his hand toward the telephone on the desk , then decides not to pick up the receiver . MCGRATH Tell him no . Tell him I 'll call him later . The Servant leaves . MCGRATH ( to Duquesne ) . My sister out in Ohio just died . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then my drunken brother-in-law . He ruined my sister 's life . He started as an ambulance-chasing lawyer , and now he works in a filling station . If I went out there , I would n't be able to see him without telling him what I think of him . Of course , I 'll have to pay for the funeral  --  I suppose you think I ought to forgive him . p. 9 DUQUESNE He 's a very bad lot , is he ? MCGRATH He 's godless and graceless and gutless . She deserved to get somebody better . DUQUESNE You were fond of your sister ? MCGRATH ( after a moment 's hesitation ) . I was fond of her up to the time she married that heel .  --  I suppose you 'd have me pity and comfort him . DUQUESNE I 've told you I am not myself a Christian . From my point of view , a bad character is just something that has to be accepted . You can perfectly well not want him around , but when things have gone beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry . MCGRATH He 'll turn up here and ask for a handout as soon as he 's got her buried . And I suppose you think I ought to help him . But I gave him handouts enough as long as Edith was living . This is going to be the end .  --  And then out there they 'd have me at a disadvantage . Once they had me away from my base , they could make it look like an accident . DUQUESNE What do you mean ? Who do you mean ? MCGRATH The people we 've been talking about . You see that broken window . DUQUESNE What happened ? p. 10 MCGRATH They threw a rock through it last night when I was sitting here in my study . DUQUESNE That does n't sound like Communists . It must have been some of these kids . Had you been preaching any sermons against youthful delinquents ? MCGRATH Yes : I certainly had . I said that they ought all to be shipped off to Vietnam . DUQUESNE I do n't blame them , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in the government , they do n't believe in religion . They do n't want to raise a family and live the way what they call the squares live  --  so they do n't want to learn to do anything , and they do n't see any point in staying in college . They do n't feel they have anything to live for except hopping themselves up with drugs and sex . They 're really dying of boredom . So they make themselves a nuisance for kicks . MCGRATH And fall into the hands of the Communists . The Communists are behind all these demonstrations . DUQUESNE What was it you wanted to talk about ? MCGRATH Well , what I wanted to ask you is this . Tell me , Francis  --  you 're a scholar  --  ( He hesitates a moment )  --  which of the words of Christ may be taken as really authentic ? p. 11 DUQUESNE Why , from the scholarly point of view , none of them . The Gospels as we have them must have been written long after Jesus 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much his words may have been edited . MCGRATH We are told in the Gospels again and again , as well as in the Pauline epistles , that Christ would come back to judge the world . DUQUESNE It may very well be that he did say that and that he had really come to believe it . MCGRATH That He would sit at the right hand of God and separate the sheep from the goats . DUQUESNE It was a very bad time for the Jews . They had been subjugated over and over . When Jesus was crucified , his followers , who believed him to be the Messiah , must have had to imagine that he would vindicate their faith by appearing on the Judgment Day . MCGRATH ( not paying much attention ) . In Matthew , it is said that He may come like a thief , that we can never know when He is coming . DUQUESNE ( smiling ) . Yes : it says we must be on the watch . MCGRATH " Then two shall be in the field ; the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 12 DUQUESNE Yes : the faithful and wise servant is taken , and the evil servant is left . MCGRATH The evil servant has sinned in eating and drinking with the drunken . DUQUESNE But you may have erred a little on the other count that is mentioned  --  that of smiting your fellow-servants . MCGRATH What do you mean ? DUQUESNE Why , I mean your attitude at present toward the Communists and the Catholic priests . MCGRATH The Communists and the Catholic priests are no fellow-servants of mine ! DUQUESNE They believe , according to their lights , every bit as much as you do that they 're serving the best interests of humanity . MCGRATH Your indifference , your infidelity have blunted your moral sense . I do n't see how they can trust those young men to such demoralizing tutelage as yours ! DUQUESNE Well , a good many people would agree with you . That 's why I 'm out here at this little college instead of in one of the big seminaries . This Protestant Irishman who 's President is an out-and-out agnostic who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's like something out of the eighteenth century . p. 13 MCGRATH Well , we 're in the twentieth now , and we have to fight a form of godlessness that 's more terrible than any Voltaireanism . DUQUESNE Take it easy , Charley : we 're all of us fallible human beings , and we have to get along with one another  --  even with the Communists and the Catholic priests . MCGRATH I am a Christian ; you 're not . DUQUESNE I could never see Calvinism as Christianity . What you are is an old-fashioned Calvinist . MCGRATH My mother 's family in Scotland were Covenanters  --  in fact , they were straight Cameronians . DUQUESNE And fought the Church of England for all they were worth , and hated the other Presbyterians who accepted the authority of the government . Well , I come from the Calvinist tradition , too ; but I developed in the other direction . You remember Admiral Duquesne who played such a role under Louis XIV ? He refused to forswear his Calvinist faith when the king offered to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiate Calvinism . That was my father 's family , and that 's why I went to the Seminary , but I found that I did n't believe and I did n't take orders afterwards . In your case , you 've never departed from the original Calvinist bigo- ( Stopping himself from saying " bigotry " ) , from the inevitable Calvinist intolerance , which had of course its historical justification . In the early days , Protestantism was wildly centrifugal , and it had to be consolidated . That was the mission of Calvin . He organized the Protestants all over Europe , and he did his best to suppress all those who did n't go along with him . Geneva was the Protestant Kremlin . p. 14 MCGRATH How can you make such an outrageous statement ? ! DUQUESNE The Protestants had complained that the Catholic Church did n't want people to read the Bible , because they feared that its inconsistencies would make them ask embarrassing questions ; but Calvin , in his Institutes , completely refashioned the Bible and provided the Protestants with a new sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been excluded . The Jesus Christ of Calvin was no longer a loving Savior ; and Calvin had some difficulty in fitting him in to his new theological machine . Since the gulf between God and man is so great , according to Calvin , that , by man 's own efforts , he will never be able to bridge it , God has found it necessary to send down to earth a part-human divine emissary to make it possible for man to attain to him . Though one wonders why God should have gone to this trouble when the whole situation had been rigged in advance long before God sent down Jesus . God had made his arrangements already about who was to be saved and who was to be damned  --  and we must never ask the reasons for his choices . So the Christian idea that salvation can be granted to anyone who earns it by repenting and accepting Jesus Christ had , for Calvinism , completely disappeared . MCGRATH You could always talk brilliantly , Francis , but  --  p. 15 DUQUESNE Please pardon this lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupational disease , I suppose . MCGRATH You 're more of a scholar than I am , but where does all this scholarship get us ? I 'm not a theologian  --  I 'm a man of action , and action is what we must have . DUQUESNE But do you understand the principles you act on ?  --  if you 'll forgive my going on in this way . At the Seminary , they softpedaled Calvin . What we read was old Fuzzy Martin 's rather watered-down version of the Institutes . But I looked the original up , and that 's when I ceased to believe . As Protestants , when we lived in France , we had had to brace and stiffen ourselves to hold our own in a Catholic world ; but when I came to grow up in America , there was no such pressure to pit oneself against , and I found myself following the development that had led from Luther to the Enlightenment . J'ai brul les tapes , as we say  --  I soon became as centrifugal as any early non-Calvinist Protestant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I are exactly at opposite poles in representing the different tendencies of Protestantism . You want to lay down the law  --  I want to reject authority . MCGRATH ( who has been listening to this with nervous impatience ) . You want to talk about the past when our whole civilization is menaced . You 're sitting up there at the college playing intellectual games with your students while I 'm fighting the battle here alone . Not only do they break my windows but they write me anonymous letters and make abusive telephone calls . I suspect that this room is bugged . I 'm going to have the walls examined when the man comes to fix the window . I know the house is being watched . Did you notice that new boy who works for me ? p. 16 DUQUESNE Not particularly . Why ? A knock . MCGRATH Come in . JONATHAN When do you want lunch , Doctor ? It 's almost one . MCGRATH ( to Duquesne ) . Will you join me for lunch ? DUQUESNE ( rising ) . No : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the head of our sociology department to talk about cordinating our courses . MCGRATH ( to the Servant ) . You can bring my tray in here . I 'll call you in a few minutes . The Servant goes . MCGRATH I 'm sorry you ca n't stay . I wanted you to observe him . Would you say he has a good face or a bad face ? DUQUESNE With these beatnik beards they 're wearing , it 's hard to tell . MCGRATH I do n't like the piercing way he looks at me  --  as if he suspected me of something . DUQUESNE He 's probably a sharp young Jew . They 're likely to look at you like that . They watch me in my classes like hawks to see whether they can catch me out . MCGRATH I do n't trust him . p. 17 DUQUESNE Where did you get him ? MCGRATH He answered an ad of mine . I 'd had to let Katy , my Irish girl , go . It 's made things very hard for me lately , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be completely impossible . I advertized for a secretary who could get me meals , and this young fellow turned up . DUQUESNE Where does he come from ? MCGRATH I have n't been able to find out . He 's very noncommittal about himself . ( Lowering his voice ) I suspect very strongly he 's a Communist . A good many of the Communists are Jews . DUQUESNE Have you talked to him ? You can usually tell them by the line they take about things . MCGRATH I 've never talked to a Communist . ( Suspiciously ) You 've evidently seen something of them ? DUQUESNE When I worked at a settlement house , just after I got out of the Seminary , I used to make a point of seeing them . I even went to their meetings .  --  Look , Charley : I think you 're upset by this Allensburg disappointment and the death of your sister  --  and then this broken window . It 's enough to get anybody down . MCGRATH I 'm all right , and I 'm ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . ) I always keep this on hand . p. 18 DUQUESNE ( laughing ) . Well , do n't shoot your servant ! They 're so hard to get nowadays . MCGRATH I 'm sure they 're out to kill me . DUQUESNE If I were you , I 'd see a doctor and tell him about everything that 's happened . If he 'd send you to a sanitarium , you 'd be able to get a rest and you 'd be perfectly safe from your enemies . MCGRATH And give up the struggle against Evil ? Nay , the gates of Hell shall not prevail against me ! DUQUESNE I 'll have to go along now . Could I come back for awhile after lunch ? MCGRATH You 're a scoffer . DUQUESNE I 'll promise not to scoff . I 'd like to hear more about what you 're doing . This reminds me of the old bull sessions that we used to have at the Seminary . So farewell for the present . He goes out , leaving the door open . MCGRATH ( going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan . Voices of BOYS , outside the window.What 's happened to Katy Nolan ? Where 's Katy Nolan ? MCGRATH ( going to the window , still with the gun in his hand ) . Get out of here ! I 've got a gun ! Laughter and cries from outside . McGrath returns to the desk and , still with the revolver in his hand , sits for a moment in thought ; then puts the revolver down , picks up the phone and dials a number . p. 19 MCGRATH ( in answer to the operator ) . This is 567-2204 . A moment 's wait . He picks up some papers and covers the revolver with them . VOICE FROM THE TELEPHONE Hello . MCGRATH Hello , Fred  --  Charley speaking . I 'm sorry I ca n't come out , but I 'm up to my neck in engagements , and it 's most important for me to be here . FRED 'S VOICE We were hoping you 'd conduct the service . MCGRATH After all , perhaps I 'm not the right person . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is your job coming . FRED 'S VOICE It 's gone . MCGRATH What happened ? FRED 'S VOICE It was a wheel I put on came off . It was all my own fault I know . I had n't screwed it on hard enough . I just did it with my fingers , and I ought to have used a wrench . I was in such a state of mind about Edie ! MCGRATH Was anybody injured ? ! FRED 'S VOICE Just a few contusions . Nothing that wo n't be all right in a couple of months . But they 're going to sue the garage , and Joe says that if they get a verdict , he 's going to make me pay . But , as a lawyer , I know he ca n't do it . Actually I 'm glad to be rid of that job . I never could get along with Joe : he was always trying to ride me. p. 20 MCGRATH ( who has been fooling with a paperknife and otherwise showing signs of impatience ) . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICE I do n't know . I 've talked to Ed Ferriss about getting a job in the post office , but  --  MCGRATH Now , I tell you : you have the funeral parlor send the bill to me , and I 'll let you have something to tide you over . FRED 'S VOICE That 's very kind of you , Charley . I  --  MCGRATH All right . I 'll have to hang up . There 's somebody waiting to see me . Sorry I ca n't get out there . Goodby . He hangs up and stares angrily at the desk . JONATHAN comes in with the lunch tray . MCGRATH Put it here on the desk . ( He clears a place , pushing the gun away under the papers . ) JONATHAN That soup may taste a little funny . I do n't know much about cooking , and I 've been studying a recipe book . I tried to make a soup that has curry in it . MCGRATH I 've told you that I like plain food . JONATHAN Taste it and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the soup but does not taste it ) . Tell me something about yourself . You 're Jewish , are n't you ? p. 21 JONATHAN Yes , Doctor . MCGRATH An Orthodox Jew ? JONATHAN No , Doctor . MCGRATH Because I do n't want to order ham or pork if you 're not going to be able to eat it . JONATHAN I do n't take the Mosaic prohibition as strictly binding any more , but it 's hard to break a negative habit . Do n't deny yourself on my account , though . I can always eat bread and vegetables . MCGRATH You do n't belong to a Reformed congregation ? JONATHAN No , Doctor . MCGRATH You 're not by any chance a Christian convert ? JONATHAN Not exactly : no . MCGRATH But you do have some knowledge of Christian ideals . JONATHAN I 've given the subject study . MCGRATH My friend who was here just now was telling me my sermons were un-Christian because I 'm preaching war on the Communists . Does that seem to you un-Christian ? JONATHAN Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a different thing . It was the holding of goods in common that one finds in a monastic order . The Communism of our time is an infamous plot to deprive people of their propperty and turn them against religion . What can we do except exterminate them like vermin ? p. 22 JONATHAN Did your friend think we ought to love our enemies the way that Jesus says ? MCGRATH Christ follows that up by saying , " Do good to them that hate you . " Are n't we doing the Communists good by preventing them from doing harm ? JONATHAN Would you say it was doing people good to drop bombs on them and burn them alive ? MCGRATH When it 's a question of stopping something evil , the more effective the weapons , the better . JONATHAN Have you heard about the non-violent resistance movement ? MCGRATH Rubbish ! What would non-violence mean in a practical crisis such as ours in Vietnam ? Abandoning the bulwarks we 've built against the tide that 's been mounting to flood the world ! JONATHAN Even under Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's and to God the things that are God 's . " MCGRATH You seem to know the Scriptures pretty well for a Jew .  --  Have you ever had Communist affiliations ? JONATHAN I was too young in the thirties to go through the Communist phase . MCGRATH You 've taken part in these demonstrations ? p. 23 JONATHAN Yes : a couple of times . MCGRATH That 's all the work of the Communists . JONATHAN Not these nowadays . Of course , they always try to infiltrate themselves into any movement of protest , but at present they do n't count for much . They 're not strong enough to capture any movement . I do n't think we 've got anything to fear like Eastern Europe or Russia . MCGRATH Were you born in Russia ? JONATHAN No : I was born in Bethlehem . ( McGrath looks up , startled ; then down at the desk , embarrassed . ) Bethlehem , Pennsylvania . But we left there when I was very young . MCGRATH Where did you grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small furniture factory . MCGRATH ( still looking down ) . Did you have the usual Jewish education ? JONATHAN Yes : I went to the yeshiva , if that 's what you mean . I was a prize yeshiva bokher . ( He smiles . ) I used to dispute with the rabbi . I even wanted to be a rabbi myself . MCGRATH ( looking up ) . What stopped you ? p. 24 JONATHAN I had the curiosity to read up on the literature of Jesus , and I came to the conclusion that Jesus was the greatest of the Jewish prophets  --  the fullest expression of the will of our God . The later prophets had been leading up to him , and Hillel , the great rabbi , had prepared the way . They were finding that our God was a God of love . MCGRATH And that makes me a bad Christian if my God says , " Vengeance is mine " ? JONATHAN ( with a Jewish gesture of outflung hands ) . I am your judge ? McGrath drops his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were . JONATHAN Excuse me . There 's the telephone . He goes out . McGrath takes up a spoonful of soup , then puts it down again . MCGRATH ( muttering to himself ) . He said it might taste rather queer . I have to be careful nowadays . Jonathan reappears . JONATHAN It 's Deacon Fairchild . He says it 's urgent . McGrath picks up the phone ; Jonathan goes . MCGRATH Yes , Deacon . p. 25 VOICE OF FAIRCHILD There 's been vandalism in the church . MCGRATH What ? What did they do ? VOICE OF FAIRCHILD They broke into the church and did quite a lot of damage . They threw the chairs down from the choir-loft and daubed the pulpit with dirty words in green paint , and they 've torn your gown to pieces . MCGRATH The Devil is loose among us ! I 'll come over as soon as I can . You notify the police . He puts the receiver down , sit terrifiedly staring a moment , then gets up and goes to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCGRATH Did you take those new hymnals to the church ? JONATHAN Yes , Doctor . Last night . MCGRATH Did you notice anything wrong ? JONATHAN No , Doctor . I put them in the racks and piled the old ones up in the vestry . MCGRATH The church has been vandalized . JONATHAN It must be that River Street gang . They 've evidently got it in for you , Doctor . MCGRATH Did you get that green paint for the door ? p. 26 JONATHAN Yes : I painted part of it this afternoon , and I 'll finish it in the morning . MCGRATH Is the pail in the house ? JONATHAN Yes . MCGRATH It 's the work of the Devil , like everything else ! JONATHAN A possible explanation , Doctor , is that Katy Nolan , who worked for you before , has a young brother who lives down there , and he seems to have a grudge against you . MCGRATH A possible explanation is that you 've come to make trouble for me ! What are you , I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now , Doctor . MCGRATH You 've told me that you were born in Bethlehem and that your father was a carpenter and that , as a boy , you disputed with the rabbis . You want me to think that you 're Jesus Christ , and that you 've come to reproach me , to judge me . Actually , you 're a Communist agent ! JONATHAN I 've told you I 'm not a Communist . MCGRATH And you told me the Apostles were Communists . JONATHAN I 'm simply here as your servant . MCGRATH The suffering Servant , eh ? p. 27 JONATHAN ( with a Jewish gesture ) . I will be if you talk like that , Doctor . MCGRATH You 're trying to frighten me with your false divinity , your mouthing of texts , your pretended humility ! But I 'm able to defend myself !

A devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spying on me and you 're trying to blackmail me  --  getting scandal from Katy 's brother . You want to give me a bad conscience . Well , the moment has come to end this ! Any jury in the world would acquit me ! Jonathan moves backwards to the blank left wall and stretches out his arms in the pose of the Crucified , closing his eyes and dropping his head . McGrath stands staring and speechless . A long moment of silence ; then he drops the hand with the gun . MCGRATH ( in a frightened voice ) . Is it really Thou  --  Savior ? Jonathan lifts his head and looks upon McGrath with great compassion and sadness . MCGRATH Hast thou really come again ! How base and unworthy I am to have stood in Thy divine presence and not to have recognized Thee ! ( He puts down the revolver on the desk and comes forward and falls to his knees . ) Thou accusest me . I know I have sinned .

God gave me authority , eloquence , a magnetic personality  --  strength and courage to fight against Evil . I had everything , I thought , in my pride , to make me a great preacher and a consecrated servant of God . But God , who had seen my sin , has known well , in His infinite wisdom , that I should never be able to expiate it and has condemned me to remain forever in this unawakened second-rate town . I have been punished by being made to preach to these petty and darkened souls who do not merely not heed me , they hate me . I am punished , Master , for that which Thou knowest , since I doubt not Thou knowest all things  --  for the sins of the flesh , for impurity  --  for the impurity of incestuous relations , which is a double abomination in Thy sight .

I thought about her sometimes with anguish  --  driving miles to a beauty parlor to try to make herself attractive for the miserable wretch she had married ; but I labored and prayed and wrestled to turn myself into a force for good . Was all my labor wasted ? Can I hope for no pity and forgiveness ? I confess I have sometimes doubted the strict doctrine of Calvin 's Institutes : that God has condemned us from birth . Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have tried to earn my redemption . I have struggled all my life with the flesh , and I have been on the whole successful  --  though , I own it with remorse , some lapses . This poor girl Katy who worked for me  --  the Tempter led me astray . Duquesne has appeared at the door and stands listening . p. 28 MCGRATH I could not marry such a girl  --  and she , of course , a Catholic  --  it would have hurt my prestige as a preacher  --  I could hardly have taken her to Allensburg  --  and I had to send her away to protect myself and her from my passion . Though I gave her a high recommendation in the hope that she would find work elsewhere , I fear her reputation has suffered , and I have earned the bitter indignities to which I am now subjected . Oh , Savior , take pity upon my contrition . She sinned and yet she was innocent . I sinned in seducing her , and now I have sinned in refusing to go to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks around blankly . Duquesne puts his hand on his shoulder . DUQUESNE Look , Charley : I 'm sorry to intrude on your devotions , but I think that I ought to tell you that you 're laboring under a misapprehension . This boy is not Jesus Christ : he 's a sociology major from the college . I 've just had lunch with our sociology man , and he told me all about him . He took this job with you here as an assignment in sociological field work . McGrath looks up at him dazed . Jonathan has dropped his arms . MCGRATH The sociologists are part of the conspiracy ! DUQUESNE You 'd better get up , old man . I 've brought the doctor from the college , and I think that you ought to see him . p. 29 MCGRATH ( rising to his feet ) . What can a doctor do for me ? DUQUESNE He can give you a tranquillizer and perhaps relieve your mind . MCGRATH How do I know that he is n't one of them ? DUQUESNE We screen our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conspiracy . He takes McGrath 's arm and leads him out . Jonathan flexes his arms , then picks up the revolver and puts it in his pocket . Duquesne comes back into the room . JONATHAN That was a tough one . DUQUESNE I could see . JONATHAN I 'm sorry I had to hear his confession , but he was on the point of shooting me.  --  Here , you better take this gun . ( He hands Duquesne the revolver . ) He imagined I was a Communist pretending to be Jesus , so I thought I could only save my life by pretending that I was Jesus . The whole thing was very embarrassing , and it 's hard to keep in that position  --  as if you were nailed up . DUQUESNE As a student of sociology , what conclusions did you come to about the Doctor ? JONATHAN I do n't think he 's difficult to analyze . From the psychological point of view , he 's got a long-standing neurosis  --  a tie-up with this sister who just died . Now he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what happened with this maid he just dismissed . From the economic standpoint , he 's terrified that the Communists will take over the country and that he wo n't have any more job . I tried to reassure him about that , but he 's too paranoiac now to be reassured . In the sociological connection , he ca n't get more than six or seven thousand a year , and that creates a servant problem . He wants somebody to do everything for him here  --  cooking and housework and secretarial work for fifty dollars a week . And he made this girl Katy go to bed with him. But I really feel sorry for him . He 's had to spend his whole life pretending . A Jew may have to do a certain amount of pretending , but usually not on that scale . It 's been hard enough for me this week to pretend to be a butler  --  and to have to pretend to be Jesus ! McGrath comes back from the other room . p. 30 DUQUESNE Did he give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some private phoning . DUQUESNE All right : we 'll leave you alone .  --  Are you sure that you 're quite all right ? MCGRATH Yes : I 'm going to do what you think Jesus wants me to . JONATHAN Let me know if you want anything , Doctor . They go out . McGrath dials and gives his number . A Carpenter appears at the door . He has a strange swarthy face , beardless but with heavy eye-brows . THE CARPENTER Is it all right to work on the window ? McGrath looks up startled and stares at him . MCGRATH Go ahead . You wo n't disturb me . ( To the telephone , with difficulty controlling his voice . ) Hello , Fred , I 've decided to come out , after all , but I ca n't perform the service . This whole thing has very much  --  broken me up . Yes : I 'm getting a reservation for tomorrow morning . You do n't need to meet me . He hangs up . MCGRATH ( to the carpenter , who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I was afraid you were n't coming today . It 's important to get it repaired . p. 31 THE CARPENTER Have you got the wooden frame ? McGrath gets it out of the wastebasket . The Carpenter holds it up , and it is seen to be cruciform , but broken . MCGRATH Ca n't you finish it up tonight ? THE CARPENTER I 'll have to make a new frame , and that 'll take a little time . MCGRATH Well , please get it done as soon as you can . THE CARPENTER I 'll try to do it sometime tomorrow . McGRATH . All right . Please see that you do . The Carpenter picks up his kit and goes out . McGrath picks up the Bible and opens it , as if he were looking for a text ; then puts it down and sinks on the desk , his hands clasping his head . MCGRATH Oh , Edie , I thought you 'd be so proud of me ! THE VOICE OF THE CARPENTER ( speaking clearly from nowhere ) . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McGrath takes down his hands and looks up .
