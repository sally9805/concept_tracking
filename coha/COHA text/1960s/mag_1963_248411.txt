THE DAY THEY SHOOK THE PLUM TREE ( 314 pp. ) - Arfhur H. Lewis-Harcourt , Brace &; World ( $5.75 ) . <P> <P> Sooner or later , the U.S. forgives most of its millionaires . It elects them Governors and Presidents and honors foundations established in their names . <P> But to be accepted , a millionaire must have a certain sense of social conscience or a gift for humility or an unmistakable faith in God . Hetty Green , lamentably , lacked all of these . <P> The Green fortune was one of the largest ever accumulated in America . It yielded an almost tax-free income of $7,000,000 a year at a time ( 1900 ) when the average individual income was $490 , and at Hetty 's death in 1916 it was estimated at anywhere from $100 million to $200 million . Hetty helped protect it by carrying her lunch-dry oatmeal-to the desk provided for her by the Seaboard National Bank . And she saw to it that not a cent or a spoonful of oatmeal went to charity . <P> Perfectly Good Nails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortune she fostered raises some interesting psychological questions . What meaning , for instance , did money have for a woman who carried her cash-often only a few crumpled dollar bills-in a handbag tied around her waist ? Who avoided taking a bath , probably in order to save soap , and who laboriously extracted " perfectly good nails " from a broken sled and saved them for some vague future use ? Who spent half the night looking for a 2 postage stamp she had mislaid ? At a time when Hetty maintained a $30 million cash bank balance , she was living in two furnished rooms in Hoboken . <P> It was not that money was new to <P> Hetty ; it had been in the family for years . She was a Robinson from New Bedford , and her grandfather had amassed a great whaling fortune . Growing up as an only child , Hetty learned the uses of money the way other youngsters learned their nursery rhymes . Her father used to prop her on his knee and read her the stock quotations . When Hetty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Green , she was already by inheritance one of the richest women in the U.S. ; her bridegroom was said to have signed a statement renouncing all future rights to her fortune . <P> <P> Old Clothes . Hetty and Henry remained together 14 years-or as long as it took them to consume most of his inheritance . After the separation , Hetty moved into a cheap Brooklyn flat with her two children . Sylvia , when she grew old enough , did the cooking ; Ned served his mother as a messenger boy , delivering bonds and other securities to Hetty 's out-of-town brokers . The richest woman in America bought her children 's clothes from an old-clothes dealer . When Ned developed an infection in one leg , Hetty tried to have it treated without charge at a succession of public clinics . The leg finally had to be amputated , and Hetty had it buried in the family plot ( where it was joined by the rest of the body 47 years later ) .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
