After a few days of relative calm on Wall Street , investors last week decided again that the stock market was no place for their money . Rushing in with sell orders that pushed volume on the New York Stock Exchange up to a frantic 6,240,000 shares , they knocked the Dow-Jones industrial average down to 560.28 on Thursday . June 14 . It was the lowest close since December 1958 . Next day there was a predictable rebound , as short sellers moved in to replace at bargain prices stock that they had borrowed when it was higher . Even so , the Dow-Jones index rose only to 578.18-which left it off 23 points for the week . <P> Once again the stocks that took " the worst pummeling were the formerly high-riding " growth " issues . Though it ended the week at 333 IBM ( 1962 high : 578 ) plummeted to 300 on Thursday-at which point , the Wall Street Journal caustically noted , its yield to investors rose to 1% . Polaroid ( 1962 high : 221 ) dropped from 109 at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday at 98 . Even blue-chip A.T . &; T. had a hard week , sliding from 109 to 105 ? . Said Sidney B. Lurie , a partner in Manhattan 's Joseph-thai &; Co. : " There 's a mass exodus on the part of investors . The professionals raised their cash earlier in the year ; now the amateurs are getting out . " <P> Slipping Pros . Lurie 's thesis was borne out by a newly completed New York Stock Exchange analysis of just who did the damage on Blue Monday . Contrary to Wall Street rumors of heavy dumping by European interests , it was primarily selling by small investors that greased the skids on May 28 and the morning of May 29 . Last week 's dip was also apparently the doing of relatively small investors who , desperate to get out , were belatedly trying to follow the market adage that advises selling on the rallies . Whenever the market opened with a little rally , it was quickly smothered in sell orders . <P> What is the small investor going to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Since stock prices began to skid six months ago , many people have retreated to the safety of savings accounts and insurance policies . The Federal Home Loan Bank last week reported that in the first quarter of this year , savings of all kinds climbed a record $8.9 billion to nearly $346 billion . Other investors , reluctant to leave the excitement of the market altogether , have been turning to mutual funds in the hope that professional investment management will see them through . But the fund managers have not done so well , either : since December , the asset values of 15 of the 20 biggest U.S. mutual funds have dropped even more sharply than the Dow-Jones average . ( But of the top five funds . Investors Mutual . Wellington Fund and Affiliated Fund did better than the average . ) <P> No Blossom . Though many stocks are now down to attractive price-earnings ratios , the general public 's buying spirit got little encouragement from many of last week 's economic indicators ( see THE NATION ) . More and more , investors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer hopeful that it will blossom into a boom or superboom . " Best guess at this point , " wrote Walston &; Co . Market Analyst Anthony Tabell. " is that it will be fairly close to two years before we have the start of another major bull market . "
