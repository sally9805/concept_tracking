" Attila is at the gates , " thundered Ernesto Cardinal Ruffini , Archbishop of Palermo . Well , not exactly . Sicily was holding regional elections , and the Communists threatened to repeat the massive gains they had scored in Italy 's national elections seven weeks ago . Red Boss Palmiro Togliatti himself was on hand to campaign . Back and forth across the island scurried hundreds of Communist squadristi ( shock troops ) , trying to swing undecided voters . <P> Premier-designate Aldo Moro 's Christian Democrats , having learned painfully from the April results that it does not pay to peddle anti-Communism softly , waged a tough campaign against " Khrushchev 's false smiles . " They could also point to Sicily 's significant economic progress under their administration . <P> The Christian Democrats ' campaign succeeded . The Reds , while keeping their place as the second largest party in Sicily ( and the nation ) , picked up only one new seat in the 90-member regional assembly , for a total of 22 . Their share of the ballots inched up to 24.8% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The free-enterprising Liberals matched their earlier success , more than doubled their representation ( from two seats to five ) . The Christian Democrats gained three assembly seats for a new total of 37 , won almost 980,000 of the 2,300,000 ballots cast , emerged with 42% of the vote , a rise of more than 3% since April and more than they had ever polled in Sicily . Wrote one Christian Democratic paper jubilantly : " We have broken the 40% barrier . " <P> His position somewhat strengthened by the Sicily results , Aldo Moro will begin trying to put together a new coalition Cabinet based on the alliance between the Christian Democrats and the Nenni Socialists . But even if he can thus continue the " opening to left , " Moro's-and Italy's-troubles will only be beginning .
