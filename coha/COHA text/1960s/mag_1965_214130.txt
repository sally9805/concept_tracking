Lent is n't what it used to be . Throughout Christendom , churches are relaxing the rigors of the traditional time of penance before Easter . <P> From its roots , the word Lent-akin to the way the days " lengthen " early in the year-essentially means spring . For Christians , it recalls Jesus ' 40-day fast in the wilderness , and began to be observed no later than the 4th century . For medieval man , Lent was a grim , belt-tightening time : only one meal a day was permitted ; meat , milk , eggs and cheese were forbidden foods . <P> A Drinking Man 's Diet ? For modern man , Lent is hardly more austere than the Drinking Man 's Diet-and it may soon be easier still . Technically , Orthodox Christians must abstain from meat , dairy and oil products ; even among the devout , the rule is strictly followed only for the first and last weeks of Lent . Protestant churches leave Lenten sacrifice up to the individual conscience , although some follow a regime similar to the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekdays , plus two smaller meatless meals , voluntary sacrifice of some additional pleasure , such as smoking or moviegoing . But even these rules have been largely abrogated in many dioceses-including all of Italy 's and at least nine in the U.S.-and for men in the armed forces . Last week Pope Paul indicated that the rules on abstaining from meat remain " for the present " - giving force to the widespread understanding that further changes will be decreed by the Vatican Council 's fourth session . <P> Some churchmen are figuring out other new ways to take the lentitude out of Lent . Operating on the sound theory that suburban commuters have no time to attend Lenten church services , the Rev. Craig Biddle III of St. Peter 's Episcopal Church in Morristown , N.J. , took his services to the commuter . With full permission from the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad , he turned the last car on the 7:17 to Manhattan into a chapel , held an Ash Wednesday service for more than 100 commuters . It was such a success that Biddle hopes to conduct similar worship-on-wheels every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another proposal for updating Lent came from the Rt . Rev. Horace Donegan , Episcopal Bishop of New York . " It is less than honest to maintain that a Lent of 40 days is the final word for our age , " he said in an Ash Wednesday sermon . " The Lenten diet is now possible only in exclusively religious establishments . The lengthy services with their glorious lessons have become unrealistic for men and women catching commuters ' trains . The quiet pace of a 17th century Lent is impossible for people living in 20th century New York . I would gladly see Lent shortened to two weeks , Passion Week and Holy Week-so that people could take on something they really had a chance of seeing through . "
