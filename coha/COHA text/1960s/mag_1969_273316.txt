COMPARED with the mighty Saturn 5 , which generated 7,500,000 Ibs. of thrust in its first stage alone , the little engine seemed puny indeed . But the importance of the Apollo spacecraft 's 20,500-lb. - thrust Service Propulsion System ( SPS ) engine was far out of proportion to its 31-ft. length . The engine 's faultless operation made the difference not only between a relatively simple moon shot and last week 's sophisticated mission , but also between life and death for the astronauts . <P> Had the SPS engine failed to ignite , or burned too briefly during the attempt to place Apollo into lunar orbit , the spacecraft would have looped around the back of the moon and headed directly back toward earth . If the engine had cut off during one crucial 30-second interval of the scheduled burn , Apollo would have been left in an unstable orbit and crashed into the surface of the moon . And , if the astronauts had not succeeded in restarting the engine after orbiting the moon , they would have been left stranded in space without hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borman . Shortly before launch , he said of the SPS engine : " It simply has to work at that point . " <P> Despite its vital importance , the SPS engine was the only major system aboard the spacecraft designed without another complete system to back it . Like other systems , the engine had duplicate parts made to take over if its tanks , valves or propellant lines failed . But space and weight limitations had forced the manufacturer , Aerojet-General Corp. , to include only a single combustion chamber , fuel injector and nozzle extension skirt ( see illustration ) . The failure of any of these parts could have meant disaster . <P> To ensure reliability , engineers tried to make the engine as simple as possible . Devoid of any frills , the SPS engine consists basically of a combustion chamber and propellant ( fuel and oxidizer ) tanks . When valves to these tanks are opened , fuel flows from one tank and oxidizer to the other to meet in the combustion chamber , pushed by pressurized helium that takes the place of potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignite on contact-no ignition system is needed . And to avoid including a complicated throttle , the engine burns only at its fully rated thrust of 20,500 Ibs. or not at all . <P> In reliability tests that extended over a period of five years , Aerojet and NASA technicians fired SPS engines some 3,200 times without a malfunction before qualifying them for manned flight . Although the total firing time on the Apollo 8 mission was scheduled to take no more than seven or eight minutes , the combustion chamber was designed to operate for 121 minutes . During tests , it actually held up for more than 30 minutes without burning out . <P> During the flight of Apollo 6 , the SPS engine took over from an S-4B stage that failed to restart , and by itself propelled the unmanned spacecraft to an altitude of more than 13,000 miles . On Apollo 7 , its first manned flight , it was started eight times . Thus , when Borman , Lovell and Anders embarked on their mission , they had a pretty good idea that their little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
