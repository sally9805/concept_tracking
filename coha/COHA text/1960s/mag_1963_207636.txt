Attorney General Bobby Kennedy last week ran the civil rights gauntlet , got flogged from both sides , and emerged scarred-but still in better shape than anyone might have expected when he started . The occasion was Bobby 's appearance before the House Judiciary Committee , where his unhappy mission was to urge members to water down a civil rights bill so that it might have a practical chance of passing the whole House . <P> The bill was an expanded version of the Administration 's own civil rights package . The Administration measure had been taken in hand by Judiciary Committee Chairman Emanuel Celler , a vociferously civil righteous Brooklyn Democrat . Also sitting as chairman of a civil rights subcommittee , Celler made one personal addition after another to the Administration bill . His version expanded the public accommodations section to forbid discrimination by any business operating under state or local " authorization , permission or license .

It extended new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as federal elections , established an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with enforcement teeth . <P> Language &; Legalism . As sent to the full Judiciary Committee , the bill simply went too far . It antagonized not only Southerners but many Republicans and moderate Democrats who questioned its sweeping grants of federal authority . Celler also angered Ohio Republican William McCulloch , ranking minority member of the civil rights subcommittee , by ramming through the changes without any effort toward bipartisan consultation . <P> As the Administration 's top civil rights troubleshooter , it fell to Bobby Kennedy to put the bill back on the track . Painfully aware that he would bring down the wrath of civil rights professionals , Bobby went to the Judiciary Committee to plead that the bill be diluted to passable proportions . He carefully avoided challenging Celler 's bill on principle , skillfully confined himself to matters of language and legalisms . The new public accommodations section , he said , was " unclear , " might extend federal regulation to " all businesses which a state does not affirmatively ban . " He questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that Article I of the Constitution gives Congress power only over federal elections . As for fair employment practices legislation , Bobby said such a section had the Administration 's wholehearted support-then warned , however , that its inclusion might " jeopardize ultimate passage of the omnibus bill .
