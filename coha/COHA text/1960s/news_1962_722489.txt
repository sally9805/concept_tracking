txt Justice Hugo L. Black of the Supreme Court believes that the Constitution prohibits all damage - suits for libel and slander . He expresses this view in an interview to be published later this month in The New York University Law Review . He was interviewed by Prof. Edmond Cahn of the law school at a meeting of the American Jewish Congress in April . Justice Black 's position is that libel and . slander suits conflict with the First Amendment 's guarantees of freedom of speech and press . He thinks that the amendment protects all speech arid writing , including // even defamatory words , from legal restraint . Because actions for defamation are so familiar a part of the legal scene in this country , Justice Black 's views are bound to strike many observers as novel and startling : They are , however , the culmination of his general attitude toward the First Amendment . " I do not believe myself that there is any halfway ground if you enforce the protections of the First Amendment , " he says in the interview , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for government to step in to regulate peopie when they do something , not when they say something . " The First Amendment provides that " Congress shall make no law .1 .. abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press . " The Supreme Court has held that its restraints apply to the states as well as the Federal Government . In his nearly twenty-five years on the Supreme Court , Justice Black has been a foremost exponent of the view that no speech or writing may be punished as such . He has dissented forcefully from the court 's recent doctrine , in cases involving communism , that the individual 's freedom must be weighed against the Government 's need to protect itself . In the interview Justice Black notes the words of the First Amendment and then says : " I understand that it is rather old-fashioned and shows a slight naivete to say that ' no law ' means no law , but what it says is , " Congress shall make no law . ' " I have to be honest about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it , says but also that I may bet slightly influenced by the fact that I do not . think Congress should make any law with respect to these subjects . " That has become rather a bad confession to make in these days , the confession that one is actually for something because he believes in it . " But when I get down to the really basic reason why I believe that ' no ' law ' means no law , I presume it could come to this : that I took an obligation to support and-defend the Constitution as I understand it . " And being a rather backward country fellow , I understand it to words say . " I believe when our Founding Fathers , with their wisdom and patriotism , wrote this amendment , they wanted to ordain that Congress , elected by the people , should not tell the people what religion they should have , or what they should believe ' or say or publish , and that is about it . It says ' no law , ' and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question by Professor Cahn about libel and slander actions , Justice Black says that he has " no doubt " that the framers of the First Amendment intended that there should be no Federal libel or defamation law , " just absolutely none so far as I am concerned . " He notes the applicability of the free speech and press guarantees to state governments now , and says : " Just as it was not intended to authorize damage suits for mere words as distinguished from conduct as far as the Federal Government is concerned , the same rule should apply to the states . " In the interview Justice Black expresses his fear of unrestrained power in the hands of government . " I agree with those who wrote our Constitution , " he says , " that too much power in the hands of officials is a dangerous thing . " What was government created for except to serve the people ? Why was a constitution written for the first time in this country except to limit the power of government and those who were selected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few individuals in the history of the world who could be trusted with complete , unadulterated , omnipotent power over their fellow men . " Professor Cahn asks Justice Black 's view of the argument that government must be able to limit free speech if necessary to preserve the country 's security . " I want this Government to protect itself , " Justice Black replies , continuing : " If there is any man in the United States who owes a great deal to this . Government , I am that man . Seventy years ago , when I was a boy , perhaps no one who knew me thought I would ever get beyond the confines of the small country county in which I was born . There was no reason for them to suspect that I would . " But we had a free country and the way was open for me . The Government and the people of the United States have been good to me , Of course I want this country to do what will preserve it . " The method I would adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I think it can be preserved only by leaving people with the utmost freedom to think and to hope and to talk and to dream if they want to dream . I do not think this Government must look to force , stifling the minds and aspirations of the people . " Yes , I believe in self-preservation , but I Would , preserve it as the Founders said , by leaving people free .
