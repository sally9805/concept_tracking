STONEWALL JACKSON 'S WATERLOO a story by Albert Murray Sometimes a thin gray , ghost-whispering midwinter drizzle would begin while you were still at school and not only would it settle in for the rest of the afternoon but it would still be falling after dark as if it would continue throughout the night . That , as Miss Lexine Metcalf for one never failed to remind you , was always the coziest time to get your homework done , even when it was arithmetic . But as nobody ever needed to tell me or anybody else I knew , it was also one of the very best of all good times to be where grown folks were talking , especially when there were people visiting because somebody was there from out of town and you could stay up beyond your usual time to be in bed . Not even the barbershop was better than that . Their chairs always formed the same family-style semicircle before the huge open hearth , and from my place in the chimney corner you could see the play of the firelight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpaper walls to the ceiling . They would be talking and , aware of the roof-sanding night weather outside , I would be listening , and above them on the mantelpiece was the old-fashioned pendulum clock , which was Papa 's heirloom from that old Manor of antebellum columns and calico kitchens in which his mulatto grandmother had herself been an inherited slave until Sherman 's March to the Sea . Sometimes it was obvious enough that they were only telling the most outrageous lies they could either fabricate or remember , and sometimes you could be every bit as certain that their only purpose was to spell out as precisely as possible the incontestable facts . Uncle Jerome would always be there , clearing his throat even when he was not going to say anything , squinting his eyes and making a face and clearing and swallowing because be was a preacher . Because although he had been a longshoreman for the last twenty-five years and a farmer for thirty years before that , he was also supposed to have The Call , although he had never been called by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for dockhand ) Donahue would be there too , but they would n't be drinking wine if he were there ; because stevedore that he was , he said that wine was for women , children , and Christmas morning ; and he would 60 STONEWALL JACKSON 'S WATERLOO get up and get the longshoreman 's knapsack he always carried and bring out a jug of corn whiskey , and Papa Whit would look at Mama and get just about tickled to death . They would be passing it around , pouring against the light of the fire , and there would be that smell then , which also went with cigar ashes and freshly opened Prince Albert tobacco cans . I always said Papoo to Papa Whit ( who was not really my flesh-and-blood father , whom I hare never seen , just as Mama was not my flesh-andblood mother ) , who used to call me his little gingerbrown Papoose-boy , which may have been why I called him Papoo , who himself was as white as any out-and-out white man I have ever seen in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half white but was also said quite accurately to be acknowledged by most of his white relatives much more readily than he himself was ever willing to acknowledge any of them . I myself once overheard Mama telling Aunt . Cat Callahan that the main reason they moved down into Mobile County when the war boom came was to get away from Papa 's white kinfolks in the country ; and another time I heard her telling Miss Sadie Womack about how red Papa 's ears used to get when the white people back in the country used to see him driving her into town in the buckboard and pretend that they thought she was one of his black field hands . Papa himself never talked about white people as such . But sometimes when they were talking about hard times , somebody would get him to tell about how he used to go off somewhere and pass for white to get a job ; and that was something to hear about too ; and one time when I was telling Little Buddy about it , he said , " Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his keen nose and his flat ass Mister Whit might have got from the white folks , he got his mother wit from the getting place . That 's why you do n't never hear nobody calling him no shit-colored halfpeckerwood , even behind his back . " There was also that time downtown by the marine store , on Government , Street , and that was a white man . He and Papa knew each other and they were laughing and talking and I was having a good time looking in store windows , and I went looking all the way up to the sporting-goods store Albert Murray has contributed articles and fiction to various magazines and anthologies , including " Anger and Beyond , " " New World Writing , " and " Dark Symphony . " The story published here is part of a cycle . A book of his nonfiction , " The Hero and the Blues , " will come out this year . and when I came back they were talking about a job ; and the man said something about something both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else and I heard the an say that Papa was a fool for being a ( turned ole niggle when he could be a sepal man , and Papa just shook his head and said , you do n't understand , Pete . Soldier Boy Crawford was the one who would always take over when they started talking about the war , because he was an old foot trooper and sometimes he still wore his Army coat , and sometimes in the winter he would wear his wraparound leggings too , and he also had a steel helmet that looked like a washbasin , and he had a German Luger and some hand grenades and a bayonet and a knapsack and a gas mask too ( because he said that he for one was never going to let them catch him with his pants down if he could help it ) . He had been to France to help them stop old Kaiser Bill . He would tell about the ocean and the torpedoes and the submarines and then about the French places he had been to , and sometimes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying . He would tell all about the kind of farming country they had over there , especially the wine-making country . He would also tell about the mountain country and the churches and then he would tell all about Paris , which he said was the best town in the world . and he used to always say a man is a man over there , and somebody else would say a man ai n't nothing but a man nowheres . Old Soldier Boy Crawford was also the one who used to tell me and old Little Buddy about some of the things old Lumina . ChoIty used to do during the war , because old Luzana himself never did talk about that , not even when you asked him about it . Sometimes he would say he was going to save it and tell us about it when we were old enough to understand it , and sometimes he would answer one or two questions about something like how far Big Bertha could shoot , and how the Chau-Chau automatic rifle worked and things like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual fighting like old Soldier Boy Crawford did . They used to always say that once old Soldier Boy Crawford got worked up you could n't stop him from fighting the whole war all over again . The rain that was falling then would be crackling down on the shingles of the gabled roof of that house , and the fire in the hearth would sparkle as Papa poked it , and I would be in my same chair in my same place in the corner , and sometimes they would be telling about some of the same old notorious rounders and roustabouts that the guitar players and the piano players made up songs about . Especially if Mr. Dock Donahue was there , because he was the one who could always remember something else about old John Henry , who went with blue steel sparks , and old John Hardy , who went with greased lightning . He held the floor all night one night just describing how old Stagolee shot and killed Billy Lyons , and they gave it to him again the next night and he told about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who used to tell about how old Robert Charles declared war on the city of New Orleans and fought the whole police force all by himself with his own special homemade bullets . But the best of all the old so-called outlaws he used to tell about was always the one from Alabama named Railroad Bill , who was so mean when somebody crossed him , and so tricky , that most people believed that there was something supernatural about him . He was the one that no jail could hold overnight and no bloodhounds could track beyond a certain point . Because he worked a mojo on them that nobody ever heard of before or since . And the last time he broke jail , they had the best bloodhounds in the whole state there to track him . But the next morning they found them all tied together in a fence corner near the edge of the swamp , not even barking anymore , just whining ; and when they gut them untangled they were ruined forever , could n't scent a polecat and would n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near hide nor hair of old Railroad Bill from that time on . But naturally the white folks claimed they caught him and lynched him . But Negroes knew better than that . The white folks were always claiming something like that . They claimed that they had caught old Pancho Villa and hung him for what he had done out in New Mexico ; and they claimed that they had hemmed up old Robert Charles in a steeple and burned him alive ; and they also claimed that Jess Willard had salivated old Jack Johnson down in Havana that time ! Well , they could go around bragging about how the great white hope had put the big black menace back in his place and proved white supremacy all they wanted to , but everybody knew that Jack Johnson , who was married to a white woman , had to trade his world championship in for his American citizenship , and thirty thousand dollars , to get back in the U. S. A. and there was a picture in every barbershop which showed him a story by Albert Murray 61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Cuban sun , lying with his legs propped like somebody lying on the front porch ; and as for Jess Willard , everybody knew he could n't even stand up to Jack Dempsey , who was the same Jack Dempsey who brought back old John L. Sullivan 's color line because he did n't ever intend to get caught in the same ring with the likes of Jack Johnson , Sam Langford , or even the likes of old cream-colored Harry Wills , not even with a submachine gun . Everybody knew that . The white folks claimed that they had finally caught up with old Railroad Bill at some crossroads store somewhere and had slipped up on him while he was sitting in the middle of the floor sopping molasses with his gun lying off to one side , and they swore that they had blown the back of his head off with a double-barrel charge of Triple-0 buckshot . But in the first place Railroad Bill did n't eat molasses , and in the second place he did n't have to break into any store to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rations everywhere he went by putting out buckets of it in certain special places for him mostly along the Railroad , which was what his name was all about ; and in the third place he must have broken into more than fifty stores by that time and he just plain did n't rob a store in the broad daylight , not and then sit down in the middle of the floor and eat right there  --  and in the fourth place there were at least a dozen other mobs in at least a dozen other places all claiming that they had been the ones who laid him low , each one of them telling a completely different tale about how and when and where it all happened . Some claimed that they had hung him upside down on the drawbridge and then riddled him and left what was left of him there for the buzzards . But they never settled on one bridge . Idid n't know very much then , but I knew enough to realize that when something happened it was always a part of something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at all that time looking at Uncle Walt sitting by the fire in Papa 's clothes telling about finding a way through Tombigbee Swamp , not afraid but careful , talking about how he was going to make it on across the Mason-Dixie , and I did n't really know anything at all about whatever it was he had done or had n't done , and I still do n't know what it was : but I knew that whatever it was it was trouble , and I said , It 's like omce upon a time back then . Because Mama had said it , who knew it from her 62 STONEWALL JACKSON 'S WATERLOO grandfather , who was Uncle Walt 's grandfather too , who knew it from his father when there was no hope of foot rest this side of Canada , which was also called Canaan , which was the Promised Land , and I also knew that all of that was about something called the Underground Railroad , which ran from the house of bondage to the land of Jubilo . They were always talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Uncle Jerome used to start preaching about . He had all kinds of sermons ready for times like that . Sometimes he would be talking about the Children of Israel , and sometimes it would be the walls of Jericho , and sometimes it would be the Big Handwriting on the wall which was also the BIG HAND writing on the wall which was also the Rig Hand writing on the WAR . That was when he used to say that the color of freedom was blue . The Union Army came dressed in blue . The big hand that signed the freedom papers signed them in blue ink which was also blood . The very sky itself was blue , limitless ( and gentle-Melt sir , before I 'd be a slave , I 'll be buried in my grave . And I said my name is Jack the Rabbit and my home is in the briarpatch ) . Sometimes he would also say that the freedom road was a road through the wilderness and sometimes it was n't any road at all because there never was any royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let nobody turn . you around , and do n't you let nobody know too much about your business either , and I said call me Jack the Bear on ray way somewhere ) . Then it would be Education again . They did n't ever get tired of talking about that , the old folks telling about how they learned to spell and write back in the old days when they used to use slate tablets and the old Blue Back Webster . The old days when they used to have to hold school whenever and wherever they could . Whenever they could spare the time from working the crops and wherever the teacher could find a place to shelter them . Whenever there was a teacher . Then later on I was the one they meant when they said the young generation was the hope and glory . Because I had come that far in school then . And sometimes it was Geography and sometimes it was History , and sometimes I had to tell about it , and sometimes I had to get the book and read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . Sometimes I had to read about Columbus too , and sometimes it would also be the explorers and the early settlers . But most of the time what they wanted to hearabout was how the original thirteen colonies became the first thirteen states and who said what and who did what during that time and how the Constitution was made and who the first Presidents were and what they did . That was also when I used to love to recite the Declaration of Independence , and the Gettysburg Address for them ; and I could also recite the Preamble to the Constitution and part of the Emancipation Proclamation ; and I could also quote from the famous speeches of Patrick Henry and James Otis and Citizen Tom Paine ; and I knew all kinds of sayings from Poor Richard 's Almanac . " That boy can just about preach that thing right now , " Mister Jeff Jefferson said one night after I had recited the William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass parts from the National Negro History Week pageant . " That boy can talk straight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Martin said looking at me but talking to everybody . " It just do you good to hear that kind of talk . " " White folks need to hear some talk like that . " " The white folks the very one said all that , Jeff . " " What kind of white folks talking like that ? " " Histry book white folks . " " What kind of histry book white folks ? " " White folks in that same book that child reading . " " I ai n't never heard no white folks believing nothing like that , in all of my born days . " " White folks printed that book , did n't they ? " " I do n't care who printed that book , that 's freedom talk . " " Well , the histry book white folks got up the Constitution , did n't they ? " " Yeah , and there was some histry book black folks in there somewhere too , you can just about bet on that . There was a jet black roustabout right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to try to climb that Bunker Hill was a mean black son of a gun from Boston . Ai n't nothing never happened and was n't some kind of a black hand mixed up in it somewhere . You just look at it close enough . The very first ones to come up with iron was them royal black Ethiopians . " " You right about that , " Mister Big Martin said . " Ai n't nobody going to dispute you about that . " " I know I 'm right . " Mister Jeff said , " and I still say these white folks need to hear some of that kind of gospel . These ai n't no histry book white folks around here and this ai n't no histry . This ai n't nothing but just a plain old everyday mess ! " " Trying to keep the black man down . " " All white folks ai n't like that , Phil . " " Yeah , but them that is . " " And some of us too Jesus , " Minnie Stovall said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us just ai n't ready yet . " " Amen , " Mister Big Martin said . " Amen ? " Mister Phil Motley said . " What you mean Amen ? " " That 's what I want to know , " Mister Jeff Jefferson said . " I mean the truth is the light just like Minnie say . " " Well , ai n't none of these peckerwoods around here ready for nothing neither , but just look at them . That 's some truth for the light too . " " Yeah but I still say some of us still ai n't learned how to stick together yet . " " Now Big'un , you know good and well that can get to be a horse of another color , " Mister Dock Donahue said . " I for one do n't never intend to be sticking with any and every body coming along because he say he one of us . You know better than that . " " That why I say some of us Jesus , " Miss Minnie Stovall said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Martin said . " I 'm talking about when you talking about going up against that stone wall . I want us to be ready . I 'm talking about Stonewall Jackson . I 'm talking about Jericho . " " Well , we talking about the same thing then , " Mister Phil Motley said . " That 's all right about your Stonewall Jackson too , " Mister Jeff Jefferson said , " and your Vardaman and your Pitchfork Ben and all the rest of them . This child right here is getting old Stonewall Jackson 's water ready . " They were all laughing then . Because everybody in Gasoline Point knew how Shorty Hollingsworth had met his Waterloo and got the name Hot Water Shorty . His wife had come up behind him and dashed a pot of scalding lye water down the seat of his pants while he was sitting on the front steps cleaning his shotgun and bragging about what he was going to do if she did n't have his supper on the table in the next five minutes . He had yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbwire fence and had n't stopped until he was chin-deep in Three Mile Creek . He had a new name from then on , and he also had a new reputation : he could outrun a strip  --  cl-assed ape . a story by Albert Murray 63 Uncle Jerome said I was learning about verbs and adverbs and proverbs ; and he preached his sermon on the dictionary that time , and he had his own special introduction to the principles of grammar : " A noun is someone or something ; a pronoun is anything or anybody ; a verb is tells and does and is ; an adverb is anyhow , anywhere , anytime ; an adjective is number and nature ; a preposition is relationship ; and conjunction is membership ; and interjection is the spirit of energy . " Another time when Aunt Sue was visiting us from Atmore , old Mayfield Turner was there , Old Sawmill Turner . the log-carriage expert . Mama said he had been trying to marry Aunt Sue for more than seventeen years , which meant that he had started before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had just separated from her fourth husband ) . Old Sawmill was wearing his blue pinstripe , tailor-made suit and his Edwin Clapp shoes and smelling like the barbershop and sitting cross-legged like Henry Ford ; and every time he took a puff on his White Owl , he flashed his diamond ring like E. Berry Wall . Sometimes when they were talking about him behind his back they used to give him names like John D. Rockefeller Turner and J. P. Morgan Turner and Jay Gould Turner because he also sported pearl-gray kidskin gloves , and he was always talking about stocks and bonds and worrying about the National Debt . I was reading about Valley Forge that night , and I knew he was there just as I knew that Mister Lige and Miss Emma Tolliver and Bra Mark Simpkins and his wife . Miss Willeen , were all there , because they were always the first ones to come by to see Aunt Sue when she was in town . But at first the only ones that I was really conscious of were Miss Lula Crayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Lula Crayton kept saying , Tribulation tribulation trials and tribulation , and Miss Ida Jefferson would respond one time as if she were hearing some new gossip , and the next time as if I were reading the Bible itself . Saying , " Honey do n't tell me . " Saying , " Lord have mercy Jesus . " Then I happened to glance up and see old Sawmill again , and he had stopped puffing on his cigar . He was leaning forward with his hand under his chin , his eyes closed , his lips moving , repeating everything I was reading , word for word . He had forgotten all about Aunt Sue , for the time being at least . I was reading about how the Redcoats were wining and dining and dancing warm in Philadelphia while the ragtag bobtail Continental Army was starving and freezing 64 STONEWALL JACKSON 'S WATERLOO in makeshift huts and hovels , and about how General George Washington himself had to get out and personally whip slackers and stragglers and would-be deserters back into the ranks with the flat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty or give me death really meant , which was why whenever you talked about following in the footsteps of our great American forefathers you were also talking about the bloody tracks the half-barefooted troops left in the snow that fateful winter . Every time I glanced up I could see old Sawmill Turner still leaning forward toward me , his lips still moving , the tip of his cigar gone to ash . Then when I came to the end of the chapter and closed the hook , he stood up and stepped out into the center of the semicircle as Uncle Jerome always did . " I 'm a histry scholar myself , " he said . " I been a histry scholar ever since I first saw the Post Office when I was a little boy back in Low &; ness County . " Then he ran his hand down into his pocket and pulled out a fat roll of brand-new greenbacks , which he held against his chest like a deck of gambling cards . He peeled off a crisp one-dollar bill and held it up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was first in war and first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen . He got it started . " " And old Tom Jefferson . " ( Off came a two-dollar bill . ) " He was a educated man and he knowed exactly what to do with his book learning . And old Abe Lincoln ? . . " ( he held up a five-dollar bill ) " came along later on and had to save the Union . Old Alexander Hamilton did n't get to be the President , but he was in there amongst them when they started talking about how they were going to handle the money , and here he is . " ( He pulled off a ten-dollar bill . ) " And here 's old razor-back Andy Jackson . " ( Off came a twenty-dollar bill . ) " He was against the red man but when he was up there making things better for all them old poor butt hillbillies he was laying the landmark for the black man without even knowing it . And then you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held up a fifty-dollar bill without even pausing . ) " He was the one old Abe Lincoln himself had to send for when the going got tight , and later on they made him the eighteenth President . " He held up the fifty-dollar bill long enough for everybody to see that it really was a fifty-dollar bill and then he held up a hundred-dollar bill and said , " Old Ben Franklin did n't ever even want to be the President . But old Ben Franklin left just as big a mark in histry as any of them . They did n't put him up there on no one-hundreddollar bill for nothing . Old Ben Franklin was one of the smartest men they had back in them days , and everybody gave him his due respect . Old Ben Franklin gave them a lot of good points about how to put them clauses in the Constitution . He was just about the first one they thought about when they had to send somebody across the water to do some official business for the government with them fast-talking Frenchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one that took a kite and Cocola bottle and stole naked lightning . " He came and stood in front of my chair then . " This boy is worth more than one hundred shares of gilt-edged preferred , and the good part about it is we all going to be drawing down interest on him , " Then he handed me a five-dollar bill as crisp as the one he had held up before , and told me to buy myself a fountain pen ; and he told Mama he was going to be the one to stake me to all the ink and paper I needed as long as stayed in school . All I had to do was just show him my report card every term . All I could do was say thank you , and I promised I would always do my best . And Miss Dula Cray-ton said Amen . And Miss Ida Jefferson said , " God bless the Lamb and God bless you Mayfield Turner . " Then before anybody else could say anything he excused himself , and Aunt Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpaca topcoat , his black Homburg hat and his Wall Street gloves and was gone . All Mama could do was wipe her eyes , and all Papa could do was look at the floor and shake his head and smile . But Uncle Jerome was on his feet again , saying he was talking about the word made manifest for manifest destiny ; and I knew he was going to take over where Sawmill Turner had left off and preach a whole sermon with me in it that night . And so did everybody else , and they were looking at me as if I really had become the Lamb or something , So I looked at the mantelpiece , and I heard the Mother Goose clock and outside there was the Valley Forge bitter wind in the turret-tall chinaberry tree . I was still sitting by the reading lamp , and he came and put his hand on my shoulder . Then I had to stand up and go to the hearth and when he said , " Say not I am a child , gentlemen sir , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , they were also saying amen to me , and amen to the Declaration of Independence , and amen to the Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation and amen to the Constitution of the United States of America .
