United Steelworkers of America is trying to block the pending merger of Kennecott Copper and Peabody Coal , now up for Federal Trade Commission approval .

It may begin at one end by an effort , to get something approaching free trade in the most advanced technological goods . At the other end the effort may be to get totally free : trade . for the major exports of developing countries .

The time has come for computers to leap to the aid of lawyers who slog through dusty tomes for legal precedents . Starting in June , attorneys for gas pipelines and electric utilities will have available a computer to do such legal legwork for them . For an annual fee to Computer Retrieval Systems , Inc. , ranging up to $3,750 , lawyers will gain access to computer tapes of all case precedents set by the Federal Power Commission in its regulation of utilities .

How and why ... The metals industry is leery of the President 's program to speed up sales of surplus strategic materials . United States strategic stockpile holdings now stand at a whopping $6.4 billion . According to the President 's 1968 Economic Report , $3.3 billion of this is in excess of present requirements .
