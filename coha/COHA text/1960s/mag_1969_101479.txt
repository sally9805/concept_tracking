As every teak-bottomed tellywatcher knows , the picture gets better every year but the sound remains the same . Each major sport seems to have settled forever into its ritual-announcing tone . Golf , for instance , sounds like the coronation of Queen Elizabeth , with Henry Longhurst slippering tactfully around the 16th green murmuring , " He 's approaching now , yes , he 's definitely getting closer . " Football bifurcates  --  one voice to make with the pseudo science , rivaling Walter Cronkite on the moon landing , and the other for the bluff autumn-day effects ( " These two teams certainly came to play ; we should see some real football today , should n't we , Rex ? " " We certainly should , Bruce ... and watch especially for the split linebackers working in and out of the pocket " ) . // Baseball is all folksy humanity and good sense . The announcers try their goshdarndest to catch the atmosphere of a Norman Rockwell post office . " It 's a game of inches , Ralph . " " It surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-ballplayer divulges nothing more arcane than " He 's still trying to keep those pitches down . " ( " Yes , Sandy , that will do . " ) And where else do you still hear the word " golly " bandied so wantonly ? // Each of these is in line with the mythology of its game . Golf announcers have to whisper , of course ( vide the P. G. Wodehouse golfer who complained of the din the butterflies were making in the next meadow ) , but they go on whispering long after the occasion for it has ceased . There is also a note of the royal function about the post-game credits . The president of the Saucy Cashbox Country Club has to be thanked and the vice-president " for the fine job they have done this year "  --  presumably for not strewing the course with land mines . Even the flunkies who shill for the local ball clubs do not pause to thank the owners for each day 's game . But golf is always a special occasion . And why , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when " college try " stood for something . Professionalism has cooled things a bit : nobody rants the way Bill Stern and Harry Wismer used to rant . Yet vestigial cheerleading lingers in the larynxes of the nonexperts , or charm partners , the Chris Schenkels and Jack Whitakers. // As to the gloomy mystagogues , the Christ-mans and DeRogatises , it seems likely that football fans prefer their game to sound preposterously scientific and would be more than happy to have it retailed in some Buck Rogers secret code . I would venture the heresy , which can later be withdrawn if the mail turns ugly , that while the game is certainly complicated , it is not that complicated . Down and outs , down and ins are the obvious ways of leaving the line of scrimmage and always were . The new names for positions simply denote that the old functionary is standing a few yards back or to the side . If the shortstop on the McCovey shift were called the strongside middle-base backer , baseball could run up a rival " now " lexicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuddy-duddy , with its lugubrious oldtimers ' days and its hoary statistical wizards ( they are the ones who get thanked after the broadcasts , you 'll notice ) . Of all broadcasters , baseball ones remain the most unassuming and relentlessly mediocre . There seems to be a terror of getting uppity , or smart ass , and their jollity is about on the level of ministers of separate faiths forced to travel on the same train . // The picture of the fan implied by all this is not pretty , whether it be the baseball idiot , small-brained and suspicious of change and thought , or the golf bore at prayer , or the football man-child roaring over his charts . In real life the fans , I know , are just as likely to be old ladies with minds like whips or dried-up literary men with cruel senses of humor , and I submit they deserve an occasional change from Frank Gifford . Besides , the games might begin to look different and to exhibit new possibilities if they were not always evoked in that same artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sports that are not aired often enough to sprout their own clich ? s , or which , like hockey and basketball , move too fast for the announcer 's small talk to wedge in . Tennis , on a brief listen , has improved somewhat . They used to tell you what love meant and what the net was for , a real Dick and Jane plot ; tennis was considered a rare , exotic import that had to be explained to Americans every time they watched it . Jack Kramer at the recent Nationals got off some medium-inside stuff that was not bad . But , like Russian industry , tennis starts from a humble base and has far to go . // The competence of certain announcers to talk about sports at all is a question for another time . For now , let 's just compare them as you would barflies : which ones can you listen to for a couple of hours and which ones clear the room . If you still watch a child 's helping of sports , as I do , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones we 've been having .
