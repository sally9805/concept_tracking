ONE of the Guide 's main attractions is the dining recommendations . Fielding fails to mention many good European restaurants - usually for a reason . Perhaps the waiters do not speak English , or the maitre is invariably rude to Americans . Sometimes Fielding leaves one out simply because it is too good and already has all the business it can handle . Why spoil it for himself with a flood of U.S. tourists ? Occasionally , Fielding just trips up . To fill gaps in the 1969 Guide , TIME asked its correspondents in London , Paris , Rome and Madrid to describe some notable Fielding omissions . Their recommendations : <P> London . Mitre Hotel , 28 miles outside London proper , at Hampton Court .

Alkalde , Jorge Juan 10 . <P> Basque cuisine . Famed New York Gourmet Michael Field pronounces its cream of king crab soup as fine a soup as any he has ever tasted .
