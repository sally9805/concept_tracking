Larry Rink , of Centreville , Mich. , who quit high school to work in a paper mill , was only 20 when his right leg had to be amputated because of bone cancer . In less than a year , the disease recurred with its usual malignancy . To Dr. Ray Houghton , an osteopathic physician of White Pigeon , it seemed that Rink 's only chance lay in cross-transplants of cancer tissues with other patients-a bold technique under investigation at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo ( TIME , March 11 ) . <P> The young amputee went to Buffalo , where surgeons exchanged some of his cancerous tissue for tissue from patients with a similar form of osteogenic sarcoma . The hope was that , although the body does not treat its own cancerous cells as " foreign " and therefore does not destroy them by a rejection mechanism , each patient 's system would regard the other 's cells as foreign , and make immune cells to attack the cancer . If that happened , blood from one patient , containing the immune cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the second patient to attack his malignant cells . It might , the Buffalo doctors hoped , stimulate his immune mechanism to turn against his own cancer cells . <P> Beginning last March , Rink had cross transplants and transfusions with two patients , both of whom have since died . Then he had exchanges with two more patients . Last week Roswell Park pathologists sent Dr. Houghton an encouraging report : their microscopic examinations of Larry Rink 's cells , like their most recent X rays and physical examinations , showed no sign of cancer . <P> Rink , who got married two years ago and whose wife expects a baby in September , looked forward jubilantly to getting an artificial leg and a steady job . Osteopath Houghton was more guarded : " We can not say he is cured-we have to wait five or ten years before we can speak of a cure . But if the disease had progressed normally , this patient would have been dead by now .
