( See Cover ) <P> It was only three months ago that the lethal little men in black pajamas roamed the length and breadth of South Viet Nam marauding , maiming and killing with impunity . No highway was safe by night , and few by day ; the trains had long since stopped running . From their tunneled redoubts , the Communist Viet Cong held 65% of South Viet Nam 's land and 55% of its people in thrall . Saigon 's armies were bone weary and bleeding from defections . As the momentum of their monsoon offensive gathered , the Communists seemed about to cut the nation in half with a vicious chop across the Central Highlands . The enemy was ready to move in for the kill , and South Viet Nam was near collapse . <P> Today South Viet Nam throbs with a pride and power , above all an esprit , scarcely credible against the summer 's somber vista . Government desertion rates have plummeted and recruitment is up , and it is now the Communists who are troubled with rising defections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and the much-vaunted Viet Cong plan to move into their mass-attack " third phase " is now no more than a bedraggled dream . <P> The remarkable turnabout in the war is the result of one of the swiftest , biggest military buildups in the history of warfare . Everywhere today South Viet Nam bustles with the U.S. presence . Bulldozers by the hundreds carve sandy shore into vast plateaus for tent cities and airstrips . Howitzers and trucks grind through the once-empty green highlands . Wave upon wave of combat-booted Americans-lean , laconic and looking for a fight-pour ashore from armadas of troopships . Day and night , screaming jets and prowling helicopters seek out the enemy from their swampy strongholds in southernmost Camau all the way north to the mountain gates of China . The Viet Cong 's once-cocky hunters have become the cowering hunted as the cutting edge of U.S. fire power slashes into the thickets of Communist strength . If the U.S. has not yet guaranteed certain victory in South Viet Nam , it has nonetheless undeniably averted certain defeat . As one top-ranking U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> " We Will Stand . " It was late July when the President of the U.S. summoned his aides to a three-day secret session to deliberate Viet Nam . Just back from Saigon was Defense Secretary Robert McNamara with the grim prognosis of peril . When Johnson announced his decision , it was the most significant for American foreign policy since the Korean War : " We will stand in Viet Nam . " To stand meant in fact that the U.S. would go to Viet Nam in overwhelming force and stay until the job was done . Why ? " If we are driven from the field in Viet Nam , " the President told the nation and the world , " then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in American promise or in American protection . " <P> By then , 75,000 American servicemen already were present in South Viet Nam or pledged to go . The President promised 50,000 more by the end of this year , and the promise was soon outstripped by the deed . The 50,000 were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total is 145,000 , and it will pass 200,000 by New Year 's Day . Target by next summer : 280,000.
