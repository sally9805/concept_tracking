txt The overthrow of the Diem regime in Viet Nam was no spur-of-the moment operation . It was achieved thru months of super-secret but highly precise planning , and it went off like clockwork . Here is the detailed story by a correspondent on the scene . BY ROY ESSOYAN SAIGON , Viet Nam , Nov. 9 ( AP ) - " Every time an American ambassador goes away , somebody starts a coup . " The words were President Ngo Dinh Diem 's and they were Henry Cabot Lodge probably the most prophetic he ever uttered . Diem was saying good-by in his downtown Saigon palace to United States Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , who was due to leave two days later for consultations in Washington on the mushrooming crisis in South Viet Nam . Signals Coup 's Start The time was noon Friday , Nov. 1 . Barely an hour later the first crackle of rifle fire signaled the start of the coup that was to end Diem 's dictatorial 8-year rule . Less than 24 hours later Diem 's bullet-riddled body and the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armored personnel carrier in the compound of the joint general staff headquarters of the South Vietnamese army . Virtually his entire army joined the meticulously planned and efficiently executed 17-hour revolt . Many months before , Diem and his family had lost the loyalty of virtually every segment of the population . The handwriting appared clearly on the wall . The generals could read it . But Diem always had been remote from the realities of life . Diem Quits Priesthood He quit the priesthood in his youth because the church was " too worldly " for him . He ruled , he said , by a " mandate from heaven . " Diem 's total aloofness from his people and the increasingly harsh rule of his brother and his brother 's acid-tongued wife set the stage for their downfall . The Buddhist crisis that erupted last May merely hastened it . It drove the Diem family to brutality and provided a rallying cry from national disaffection and resentment . The plotters started meeting months ago . Maj. Gen. Tran Van Don , a key figure in the coup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of strategy at La Cigale , a popular Saigon nightclub , and in the Caravelle hotel , innocent appearing gathering spots . Sealed on Fairways But the fate of Diem 's regime could well have been sealed on the golf course . Some time in the last two months , on the fairways , one of the leaders of the coup sounded out a high-ranking American on what the United States attitude would be toward a coup . It was one of the many soundings and previous to this one the American rejoinder had always been a " no comment . " But by this time the Kennedy administration had lost its final illusions about Diem 's regime and the American told the Vietnamese general the United States would not object  --  according to the best available information . United States and Vietnamese officials deny that Americans were directly involved in planning and executing the coup . But there seems little question the United States encouraged the coup with official statements expressing disapproval of the Diem regime 's repressive measures against the Buddhists . More important , a progressive series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States sentiments far more than words could . Praised by Expert The clockwork precision with which the coup was executed by Vietnamese generals led one American military expert to comment , " It shows the Vietnamese can run a pretty good war if political considerations are removed . " He was referring to one of the Vietnamese army 's main grudges against Diem 's suspicion-encrusted regime  --  that he held all the reins of military power , shifted military commands for political purposes and to protect himself from attack , and went over the heads of his top commanders in directing military operations . Coup leaders also have said they were disturbed when Nhu started dropping hints he would rather make a deal with communist North Viet Nam than submit to United States pressure for reforms and a streamlined nonpolitical war effort against the Communists . " The coup was a masterpiece of planning and execution , " one western military expert says . " I 've been told a detailed staff planning was involved in troop movements outside Saigon weeks before the coup , and within Saigon during the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Secrecy w a s maintained thruout by departmentalizing jobs , one man to a job . " Take Over Switchboards Another expert comments : " They thought of all the little things that are so frequently overlooked in coups that backfire . They not only seized radio stations a n d telecommunications centers right off the bat , they even took over telephone switchboards that could have been used . as they were used the last time , to rally support . " Gasoline allocations to commands outside Saigon  --  of dubious loyalty to the rebels  --  were reduced four days before the coup to prevent Diem forces from moving too many troops if they rallied to a palace call for help . " The pinpoint accuracy of artillery fire that reduced the biggest center of resistance in Saigon , the barracks and ammunition storehouse of the palace guard one mile from the palace , suggested the artillery must have been in position for some time before the coup . Begin Military Moves Weeks earlier several military operations were launched north and south of Saigon . They bagged practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of rebellionminded generals together . The day of the coup the boundaries of the 3d army corps around Saigon were moved south to the banks of the Mekong river , removing the 7th division from the command of a Diem political appointee to that of Brig . Gen. Ton That Dinh , a key figure . This secured the southern flank below Saigon for the rebel cause . The 5th division under Dinh 's trusted Col. Mguyen Van Thieu protected the northern flank . Thieu , remembered for his loyalty , now has taken the rank of Brigadier general and command of the 3d corps . Bade Diem Farewell By midday Friday , Nov. 1 , everything was set . Lodge and Adm . Harry Felt , visiting United States Pacific commander , bade Diem farewell after a formal call . At his headquarters near the airport Gen. Don fretted . H e had been informed that Felt 's departure , originally scheduled for 11:30 a. m. , less than two hours before the hour set for the coup , was being delayed by the Diem visit . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12:30 p. m. or possibly 1:30 p. m. , just past the zero hour . The Plot was suddenly in danger . Shutter Shop Fronts As it turned out Felt reached the airport not too much after the appointed time . By 1 p. m. in downtown Saigon and around Diem 's Gia Long palace the streets were deserted and shop fronts shuttered for the siesta . Fifteen minutes later the rebels struck . 107F Three marine b a tt alions seized the national and municipal police headquarters in the western suburbs , the telegraph office , the radio stations , and the ministry of defense telecommunications center . A government special forces unit near the airport was subdued . All key suburban installations fell to the rebels in the first two hours . Then the rebel forces closed in on the center of town . Warned Off Streets The roof garden of the Rex , United States military officers ' mess overlooking the palace , was crowded with Americans warned off the streets . At 4:30 p. m . Diem telephoned Lodge and asked him what he knew about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more . Lodge said he was concerned for Diem 's safety and offered to do what he could . Diem brushed him aside and I said : " I shall do what duty and good sense requires . " That was the last Lodge heard from Diem . At 6 p. m. the rebels started shelling the barracks of t h e palace guard to cut off possible reinforcements for the palace . At 8 p. m. , according to best available information n o w , Diem and Nhu stepped quietly thru one of the palace gates , walked thru the darkened streets to a waiting car t w o blocks away and were whisked off to a small Roman Catholic church in Cholon , Saigon 's Chinese twin city . Seize Guard Barracks The guard barracks was overwhelmed at midnight . Four hours later rebel tanks moved on the palace . Buildings around the palace caught fire . The palace held out for more than 2 1/2 hours . At 6:37 a. m. a white flag was hoisted from the palace , a cheer broke out outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-foot wall surrounding the palace grounds . Inside Nhu 's office the bank of telephones on his desk lay shattered . Ten copies of a war book " shoot to kill " were scattered on a table . On a table in Diem 's office upstairs was a pile of men 's magazines . Diem and Nhu , who had refused several rebel promises of safe conduct , were arrested in the church . Don said later that Diem and Nhu were killed during a struggle over possession of a gun belonging to the rebel captain assigned to bring them to army headquarters . He said the fight broke out when Nhu lunged for the captain 's pistol in the darkness of the personnel carrier . The top man of the coup , before and after , is generally accepted as Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh , chief of state in the new government . F r e n c trained " Big Minh " is liked and respected by Americans .                    @
