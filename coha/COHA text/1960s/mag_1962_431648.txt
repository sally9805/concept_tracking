 | What Are Churches For ? TO MANY people the Church today is a pleasant community activity where one 's children attend Sunday school , where adults go to worship occasionally , and where one goes during he week to meet other nice people slid raise money so that the Church art stay open . On Sundays the parish is a religious institution , but the Gospel proclaimed on Sunday finds no translation into the relationships of the weekday . During the week the church is a series of promotional , organizational and semi-commercial activities . We have all become so caught up in the successful running of the Church that it is common for many to think that numerous activities are identical with religion . To pay mortgages , to build new parish houses , to put on a drive for new members , to hold bazaars , lunches , dinners , and bake sales ? all this is admirable , but it is not religion . Indeed , it may well be that most of those things upon which we usually congratulate ourselves are , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repugnant to Almighty God . If this be true , we need to pause abruptly amid the mad day-to-day business of the average parish and remember the wisdom of the 127th @#  | Psalm : " Except the Lord build the house , their labor is but lost who build it . " The Church 's proper and constant claim is that the Christian religion alone can save the world , but the average American is not impressed with this claim . The reason is that he simply can not imagine the church in his community in any such heroic and revolutionary role . The only picture he has in his mind of organized Christianity in action is that of a church on Main Street . If what goes on there is a sample of how the world is going to be saved , we can hardly blame him if he fails to be impressed . The ordinary day-by-day life of the average successful local parish makes a mockery out of the world-influencing revolutionary claims of the Christian church . It is customary to lay the blame for public indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our age . But in my opinion neither of these does us as much harm as does the constant parade of trivialities that the typical church program offers to the public . Only rarely is this program related to the real issues which are clawing the soul of modern man to shreds . This program speaks with no commanding voice to the multitudes perishing for lack of certainty . Indeed , it gives the distinct impression that it is concerned exclusively with its own self-preservation . But if the absorption in promotional activities is not the true function of the parish , we have the right to ask , " W should its true function be ? " Let us look at the first parish , t Spirit-filled fellowship which ca into existence immediately of Pentecost . What were the mar which distinguished it , since a p ish is nothing other than a fella ship of people ? It was a fellowship which had h a soul-shaking personal experic with Jesus Christ . Living , walking , working , talking , eating , arguing daily Christ had stamped Himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn from the midst by crucifixion and mirac lously restored to life by the Resu rection , they could give Him n other name than God . He had polarized their lives . Now compare this with today ' . average parish fellowship ! Hardly anyone , not even the clergy , has remotely similar personal awareness of the reality of Jesus Christ . Th true function of a parish begins with the difference Jesus as the Living Christ makes . Until the experience of the disciples actually becomes our own experience , as indeed it can , nothing much of any religious significance will happen to any modern parish . The first parish was a believing fellowship , and it did not worry much about its own self-preservation . It worried about getting God 's will done . Because it believed , it had no fear . Without fear it was enabled to confront the world with a challenge . Because it challenged , it was  | cited to . All this was possible ause it had simple , unswerving faith in God . Another characteristic of the itecostal fellowship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rust in God through faith in Christ night with it a remarkable new use of being free from anxiety , read and guilt . It was somehow Bier to overcome temptation and good . One felt not only clean but stored to fellowship with God . ! low conspicuously lacking this awareness is in our modern parIles ! Not only is there no sense of he forgiveness of sin , but there is hardly any awareness of sin . In any places it is not thought good aste to mention the idea . Yet the ' hristian of the early Church knew at his freedom from sin had been on . His faith and God 's forgiveess made of him a new man in hrist . Most of us today are the me men we always were ; and here is hardly anything in our parch life that would suggest we could something better . The task of the Parish was to prolaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ to he whole world . It did not waste ' me building buildings , gathering unds or providing good companonship . Its job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cad . Being a member of the first fellowship did not mean committee work . It meant a changed relationship to God . It meant a new quality to life among believing Christians . It meant a joyous expectancy that the future could not be bad . These are the basic qualities which have so largely disappeared from our parishes . To provide these is the true function of a parish . Until they are provided , the most successful church by our statistical standards stands before God as a colossal failure . It is no easy thing to change a modern parish over so that its true function becomes predominant . But I now lay before you , with much soul-searching and hesitation , a number of positive suggestions . I believe every parish needs a thoughtful group of laymen and women who have the responsibility of asking three questions and finding the answers to them : a . What is the true religious work of this parish ? b . How can all that is done in this whole parish set that true religious task forward ? c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of the people involved ? In the average parish nobody ever asks these basic questions . It is generally assumed by the lay people that this is something the clergyman is taking care of . It is not possible for him to do it by himself . If he is the only one caring and thinking about it , it will never happen . This is the job of the vestry . It is the job of the leading women . It should be the most widely discussed subject at all gatherings of the parish leadership . The entire program should be judged by the answers given to these three ques- tions . In a number of parishes , where such a group of lay people are doing this , startling things are happening in a religious way . My final suggestion may also startle you a bit . It is a growing conviction of mine that no parish can fulfill its true function unless there is at the very center of its leadership life a small community of quietly fanatic , changed and truly converted Christians . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergyman , is really greatly changed ; but even where there is a devoted self-sacrificing priest at the heart of the fellowship , not much will happen until there is a community of changed men and women . We think this is so centrally important to the evangelizing work of the Church that in Trinity Parish now we are sending not one priest into any curacy all by himself , but a team of three or more . We do not want ordinary men . Ordinary men can not win the brutally pagan life of a modern city for Christ . We want quiet fanatics , men who will outlive and outsuffer the worst sufferings of the slums and within their little community reveal to others a kind of Christian relationship that is so different and so accepting that it can not be resisted . That little , changed community must be ever anxious to admit those who wish to share its life , whatever their race or condition may be . Modern life places many obstacles in the way of Jesus Christ , but no one should be discouraged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could fly . Heavy and ungainly things were growing on their shoulders which made them clumsy when they tried to run . Many complained of the awkwardness and futility of this new growth upon them . Then suddenly one day , an adventuresome sparrow ran harder than ever before and suddenly found himself gracefully sailing above the earth . What he thought were burdens were really wings ! God is surely preparing His Church for some decisive role in history . If we can work with divine discontent and candid self-criticism , He will help us to make His Gospel heard yet by a generation that suspects at present that we do not mean what we are saying . @#
