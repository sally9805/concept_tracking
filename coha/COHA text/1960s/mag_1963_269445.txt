From remote Yemen last September came word of a revolution that had toppled the centuries-old dynasty of Imam Mohammed el Badr . Leader of the coup was Colonel Abdullah Sallal , 45 , newly appointed commander of the palace guard , who announced in the Yemen capital of San'a that his troops had killed the Imam and were in control of the primitive , Nebraska-sized country . Weeks later it was learned that Badr had in fact escaped the shelled ruins of his palace and taken refuge in Yemen 's rugged hill country , whose warlike tribes have traditionally been loyal to the Imam . <P> Clouded Claims . Ever since , helped by money and supplies from the uneasy monarchs of Saudi Arabia and Jordan , the Imam and his tribal warriors have been inching doggedly back toward San'a . President Sallal appealed for help to Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser , an old friend of the Imam but an even more implacable foe of the oil-rich desert dynasties who were helping Badr . Nasser rushed in Egyptian troops , whose Soviet-made guns , tanks and jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Though the republicans had not in fact won the whole country , the U.S. decided reluctantly last December to recognize Sallal 's regime , having first won Nasser 's promise to withdraw his troops . Egypt 's President has not only failed to honor his pledge but has actually raised the expeditionary force to 23,000 troops on the pretext that Britain , Saudi Arabia and Jordan have all sent in forces to help the Imam . Britain , which has not recognized Sallal , fears that Egyptian penetration of the Arabian Peninsula will isolate its oil fields and deal a crippling blow to its economy . <P> Fearful lest the hot little war engulf the entire Middle East , the U.N . last week sent Ralph Bunche , a veteran Middle East troubleshooter who is trusted by both sides , to discuss a solution with representatives of Sallal and the Imam ; from Yemen he will go to Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Jordan . <P> The actual course of the fighting has been clouded by the grandiose claims of both sides and the formidable obstacles that face Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone reach the battle lines . One who succeeded was TIME Correspondent George de Carvalho . From Beirut last week he cabled his report on a 23-day trek in which he crossed the peaks , plateaus and wadis from Aden to the Saudi Arabian border , traveling a total of 1,000 miles by camel , donkey , car and shoe leather without once leaving royalist-held territory ( see map ) . Along the way , Correspondent De Carvalho was repeatedly shot at by Egyptian fighter planes , tanks , mortars , and artillery , saw two of his six Yemeni guards killed and one wounded in battle . <P> Rifles &; Faith . The fighting is most intense in a 70-mile arc curving around the eastern approaches to San'a . In most areas , the royalists limit themselves to hit-and-run guerrilla raids , but here they are taking and holding ground , attacking steadily and advancing on a wide front . Reports De Carvalho : " The incredible fact is that the Egyptians are losing in Yemen . Ragged , barefoot Yemeni tribesmen , armed only with ancient rifles and faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite troops despite their overpowering Soviet equipment , overwhelmingly superior firepower , and unchallenged airpower.
