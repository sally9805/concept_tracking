On the eve of the 16th anniversary of Indian independence , 2,000 demonstrators marched outside Parliament in Delhi , waving banners and chanting : " Leave the throne , Jawaharlal . " Inside the horseshoe-shaped chamber , Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru faced the first no-confidence motion in his 16 years in power . <P> The censure motion was sponsored by Nehru 's most outspoken political foe , stooped , acerbic J. B. Kripalani , a political independent who was returned to Parliament only two months ago in a surprising by-election victory , after having been swamped by now discredited ex-Defense Minister Krishna Menon in last year 's general election . Kripalani proposed to censure the government among other things , over official cor ruption , spiraling food prices and prohibitively high taxation . Though Kripalani is pro-Western , the censure proposal became an umbrella for all kinds of other Nehru critics , including leftists angered by Nehru 's few tentative steps away from nonalignment . <P> One major leftist target was India 's agreement to permit Voice of America broadcasts for three hours daily over a transmitter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now trying to back out of it . Another target : the joint air defense exercises that the Indian air force will soon hold with the U.S. and British air commands . In an effort to silence his leftist critics . Nehru has won extensive promises from Russia and its satellites for missiles , fighters , and small arms . Top government officials expect little in substance from Soviet aid promises , but insist that the symbolism of such aid is necessary to maintain India 's image of nonalignment . <P> With Nehru 's Congress Party holding a massive 229-seat plurality in Parliament , there is no chance that the censure motion will be carried . But Nehru is plainly worried over the rising opposition on both the right and the left and over the by-election trend away from the party in what were once considered impregnable Congress constituencies . He has promised to shake up his government and to demand the resignation of some Cabinet ministers so that they can work full time on organizational duties to revitalize the party . Nehru 's plan is scorned by C. Rajagopalachari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free-enterprising Swantantra Party . " Theatricals do not cure diseases , " says C. R. " The Congress Party is sick , and I do not want sick persons in charge of the government . "
