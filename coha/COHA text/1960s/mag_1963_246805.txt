For a year and a half respectable professors from the Dsseldorf Academy of Medicine sneaked around public washrooms on an odd mission : checking the hand towels in 136 inns and restaurants . They worked with stealth , lest owners get mad at the implied aspersion on their premises . Not until he was unobserved did a researcher pull out of his briefcase a letter-sized sheet of sterile , moistened collecting paper and press it against a towel . Then he folded the paper and slipped it back into his briefcase . Back at the laboratory , the sheets were checked for bacteria . Though the public hand towel has long been recognized as insanitary , it is still widely used in Germany , and Dr. Walter Kikuth and Dr. Ludwig Grn wanted to study just how dangerous roller towels were . They wound up appalled . <P> Of 70 old-fashioned cloth towels , seven were so saturated with germs that no count could be made . Another 63 averaged 16,527 germs per square centimeter , but even worse than the germs ' quantity was their quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boils and wound infections . A third of the towels bore colon bacteria , which spread dysentery , typhus and typhoid . <P> Surprisingly , the doctors found that many hospitals and clinics also use common towels . And some of the hospital bugs were the deadliest of all staphylococci-the strains that are resistant to most forms of penicillin and many other antibiotics . Among the worst places was a maternity ward , where women picked up infections and took them home with their babies . <P> The Dsseldorf doctors are confident that infectious diseases can be reduced by getting rid of the common towel . But the hot-air dryer , they say , is far from an effective replacement ; it spreads germs faster by blowing them into the air . The Dusseldorf doctors prefer either the long roll , in which each part of the towel is used only once , or individual paper towels . Either way , they urge : " One person , one towel .
