When Pete Gogolak left the Buffalo Bills in the neatest jump since Jack and the candlestick , Personnel Chief Harvey Johnson found himself sifting through close to 100 applications for Pete 's place-kicking job . These included an ambidextrous Italian who could boot the ball a fabulous five feet off the ground , a mechanical engineer who made two feet , and an Austrian count who lives in a castle in the Alps . In camp the Bills pared the list down to Bob Hight , who has one arm and one eye ; Wolfgang Felgemacher , a West German bricklayer ; and a third gentleman  --  a frustrated actor who once played football for something called the New Bedford Sweepers . The Sweeper finally won the job . His name , as fans know by now , is Booth Lusteg . He can kick consistently and for distance ; as a result Buffalo  --  with a new coach in Joe Collier but with the same depth , experience and cohesiveness that have made it the class of the American League for two seasons  --  may present pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship , although the odds are always against such repetition . // The Bills do have their problems . Good running backs are scarce , and they could use more depth in the offensive line , especially now that Center Dave Behrman has retired . The Bills do have depth on defense , which is where they have won their championships . Mike Stratton , on the right side , is the best of the starting linebackers  --  Harry Jacobs and John Tracey are the others  --  who are beginning their fifth season as a unit . Second-year man Marty Schottenheimer is good enough to start , and rookie Paul Guidry from McNeese State is not far behind . // The Bills drafted Charlie King from Purdue for the defensive backfield , but he has little chance of breaking into what is probably the deepest secondary in the league . Butch Byrd , a gifted punt-return man and one of the meanest tacklers around , is All-League at corner back , as is George Saimes at free safety . When Booker Edgerson was injured last season Charley Warner did an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the job from him . Hagood Clarke and Tommy Janik , who were picked up from Denver in a steal , play strong-side safety . // Despite all this the Bills ' primary defensive strength is a powerful line equally adept against the passing or running game . Ron McDole and Tom Day are quick and mobile ends whose special talent is pursuit to either side of the field . At one point last season Buffalo had not allowed a touchdown by rushing for 18 consecutive games . Tom Sestak , a perennial All-Star tackle , and Jim Dunaway , destined to become one , are both unusually skilled in the art of interior pass-rushing . Don Thiesen , cut by Cleveland , is a good-looking reserve tackle with a chance to make the team . // Except for one man , the offensive line has been together for five years . Led by Guard Billy Shaw and Tackle Stew Barber , it is superior to most in the NFL. // Last year the Bills began the season figuring to abandon their ball-control style and become a " home run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth game , injuries had finished top receivers Elbert Dubenion and Glenn Bass for the season , and the plan was dropped . Buffalo was again Buffalo grinding it out , wasting the clock , winning as unspectacularly as possible . // Now , however , with a good blocking and running back ( Billy Joe )  --  who had replaced a great , but troublesome , blocking and running back ( Cookie Gilchrist )  --  gone to Miami , the Bills are left with only one dependable regular , Wray Carlton . He is an excellent blocker but will not break away much . Rookie Bobby Burnett of Arkansas has beaten out Bobby Smith at the other running back position and , though he learns quickly and had a fine exhibition season , the Bills are skeptical . They are talking about going to the home run again , and this time there is nothing to fall back on . The runners are just not there . They will have to throw the ball more . // Flanker Dubenion and Split End Bass are completely recovered and can do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any game with their speed . Tight End Paul Costa  --  at 6 feet 5 , 256 pounds the biggest receiver in football  --  played well after being called up from the taxi squad in midseason , and a promising rookie , All-America Bobby Crockett of Arkansas , may be less than a year away . // At quarterback , Jack Kemp has always had the arm . Now he has become sound at play-selection  --  and is one of the best at calling audibles . He also has learned to stay in the pocket . Kemp has guided the team to two titles , is the league MVP and has the utmost confidence of his teammates . Daryle Lamonica , who used to come in and pitch the team out of trouble when Kemp had his erratic stretches , has just concluded his finest training camp and is ready again in the bullpen. // The Bills do a lot of thinking about the NFL-AFL merger and the " supergame " in January that should bring the leagues together for the first time . " We have always won on desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same this year . Besides the money factor , which is substantial , that game is going to make history . Everybody will remember it for a long time . It would be the supreme thrill to play in it . " // Houston , among others , will have something to say about that , but the Bills could make it on their defense , kicking game and the fine passing that would come with good years from Kemp and Lamonica . Mr. Lusteg has kicked his way onto quite a team .
