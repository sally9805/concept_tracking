FROM the outset of the presidential campaign , Hubert Humphrey and Richard Nixon have tiptoed with excruciating care around the issue of the Viet Nam war . Both wished to avoid saying anything that might jeopardize the peace talks in Paris . Conveniently , the negotiations also gave both an excuse to avoid making themselves targets for either hawks or doves in the U.S. <P> <P> But that unnatural silence could not endure . Last week the issue emerged , noisily if not very clearly , as a crucial point of debate in the race . <P> Slapped Down . It was Humphrey who , seeking to convince skeptics of his dedication to peace , forced the controversy to the surface . He has experimented with optimistic predictions over the past few weeks . In private Administration meetings , he argued for a bombing halt , somewhat to Lyndon Johnson 's irritation . Twice Humphrey publicly suggested a softening of U.S. war policies-through a bombing pause and troop withdrawals-but each time the President publicly slapped him down . <P> <P> Last week in Toledo , the Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Viet Nam situation in light of the assistance that is required from the U.S. " As the South Vietnamese army improved , he added , he would " move toward a systematic reduction in American troops . " The pledge was hardly startling , since that has been the Pentagon 's goal for some time . <P> Still , talk of a troop cutback worried Republican strategists . Did Humphrey know something ? Was Johnson about to announce a move toward de-escalation that would enhance his Vice President 's chances ? To minimize the impact of any such move , Nixon immediately countered that Humphrey is so anxious for a settlement of the war that he would endanger the U.S. negotiating position by promising cutbacks of U.S. combat forces . The next day , Wisconsin 's Melvin Laird , a knowledgeable member of the House subcommittee on defense , accused Humphrey of " loose talk-dangerous , harmful talk - confusing and , in my view , irresponsible talk . " Whereupon he proceeded to indulge in much the same sort of talk . By June , Laird went on to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in Viet Nam . <P> Laird 's motive was to give the impression that any troop reduction would be " in the normal course of events " and would therefore reflect no credit on the Democrats . The Administration quickly denied that any such reduction was envisioned . The U.S. , said Defense Secretary Clark Clifford , is still building up to its authorized level of 549,500 , and " we intend to continue . " <P> The politically inspired exchange left in doubt the question of the U.S. troop level and of the course of the war it self . Clifford issued his denial of Laird 's statement only at the President 's orders . Pentagon officers naturally supported the Defense Secretary 's statements . Yet other Administration sources suspect that both Laird and Humphrey may well be correct in their predictions that U.S. combat forces will be reduced . <P>
