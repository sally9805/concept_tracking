The merest fault darkens his day . Rehearsing with Joan Sutherland , he could notice nothing but the graceless clumber of La Stupendas feet . The curtain bothered him when the orchestra was at its best ; the lights annoyed him when the set was perfect ; poor acting upset him when the singing was glorious . With a board of directors that applauds him with rubber-stamp approval , an audience that regularly fills every seat , and a local gentry that promises in advance to make up the final deficit in his budget , San Francisco Opera Director Kurt Herbert Adler remains on the critical list . <P> Inflaming Ease . In ten years in San Francisco , Adler 's furious pursuit of perfection has brought remarkable results . The company has given the first U.S. performances of such works as Britten 's Midsummer Night 's Dream and Cherubini 's Medea , revivals of Nabucco and Ariadne auf Naxos , American opera debuts to such singers as Birgit Nilsson , Leontyne Price , Boris Christoff , Sandor Konya and Sutherland . Elisabeth Schwarzkopf , who has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing in San Francisco since 1955 . On good nights , the opera 's chorus and ballet are matchless in the U.S. , and some of San Francisco 's stage sets make the Met 's look as if they were built by tenors . Still , the Met dwarfs Adler 's company with the kind of ease that inflames . The Met has more money , its own orchestra , and a season four times longer than San Francisco 's seven weeks . <P> Matching the Met in size as well as quality is Adler 's prime ambition . He approaches the job with enough cheek to propose himself as a cover boy to magazine editors , enough musicality to remain an undisputed favorite among singers , enough energy to stay at the opera house 18 hours a day during the season and turn his vacations into 48-hour jokes . <P> Adler spends nine months a year in San Francisco and devotes the winter months to scouting trips to New York and Europe . He often spends Christ mas Day in a hotel room talking to singers and agents ; two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 44 days . Now 58 , Vienna-born Adler traipsed across Europe until 1938 , learning opera while lending his hand to such diversions as an Austrian production of Abie 's Irish Rose . Then he came to the U.S. and , in 1942 , signed on as San Francisco 's chorus director . When Founder and Director Gaetano Merola died in 1953 , Adler took over . <P> The Adatorium . Some vestiges of Merola 's Neapolitan hand still persist in the company 's top-heavy Italian repertoire . Last week , Adler opened the new season with a week of pure paesani , starting with Ada - as the company has done so often that a local critic named the War Memorial Opera House the Adatorium . But the new season also includes Poulenc 's Dialogues of the Carmelites , Strauss 's Capriccio , Tchaikovsky 's The Queen of Spades - all operas the Met audience will not see .
