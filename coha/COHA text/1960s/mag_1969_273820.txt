Pity the poor Baltimore fan , for this is not his year . He saw the supposedly invincible football Colts humiliated by the New York Jets 16-7 in January 's Super Bowl ; three months later he watched in utter disbelief as the Bullets , boasting the best record in the National Basketball Association , managed to blow four straight games in the playoffs to the New York Knicks . But hope is on the wing again . Last week , at the season 's midpoint , baseball 's highflying Orioles enjoyed a lavish 10-game lead over the second-place Boston Red Sox in the American League 's Eastern Division . With a won-lost percentage over .700-by far the best in either league - the Orioles have clearly established themselves as the team to beat in 1969 . <P> A sizable share of the credit goes to Pitcher Dave McNally , 26 , a smooth , powerful lefthander . Last season , he won 14 games and lost only two after the All-Star break , winding up with a 22-10 record as the Orioles finished in second place behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight games . His overpowering performance has given the club a quality it had sorely lacked-leadership for a fitfully effective mound staff . <P> As far as the record books show , Mc-Nally is one of the few major-league players in history from Montana . Though Billings Central Catholic High School did not even have a baseball team , McNally made an impressive mark in American Legion ball . In 1960 he carried Post 4 to the Legion World Series with a brilliant 18-1 record that included five no-hitters and 259 strikeouts in 105 innings . In the Series , he struck out 47 batters in three games , and scouts from ten teams scrambled for him . Baltimore finally picked up the 17-year-old fire-bailer with an $80,000 bonus and packed him off to the Victoria , Tex. , Rosebuds . <P> Two years and 23 minor-league victories later , McNally made his debut with the Orioles by pitching a two-hit shutout against the Kansas City Athletics and winning a permanent place in the starting rotation . But then he became one of those supposedly sure bets that never quite pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good season ( 13-6 ) ; that was 1966 , the year the Orioles won the pennant and took the World Series in four straight . In 1967 , he tore a tendon and developed something of a paunch , finished the year with a disappointing 7-7 record . Before the start of the 1968 season , however , he underwent some strenuous arm therapy to stretch the tendon , lost 15 Ibs. and showed up for spring training in mint condition for the first time in years . His slider , an essential pitch for a lefthander throwing to a right-handed batter , returned better than ever . McNally was on his way . <P> Broken Laces . Now he is one of the most respected pitchers in baseball . Perhaps his chief asset is strength . Although his motion is deceptively smooth , McNally comes off the mound so hard that he regularly snaps his shoelaces . As evidenced by last year 's performance , his 5-ft. 11-in. , 190-lb. frame is not easily sapped by the heat . Says Manager Earl Weaver : " Dave has it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a no-hitter any time he pitches . When his control is right , he 's just about unbeatable. "
