Producers have no trouble seeing her as Joan of Arc , Ophelia , Queen Victoria , and a neat pre-beatnik in I Am a Camera . But who in the world would ever cast her as a cowpoke ? Herself , Julie Harris , 39 , that 's who . She thought she 'd like to try a bit more TV work , and asked her agent if there might be just a little part on her favorite show , Rawhide ? Wai , sure , podnuh , and Julie not only gets to fall in love with Rowdy Yates ; she gallops around a cattle drive besides . Nice cast , too . " Handling the calves was a delight , " drawls Julie . <P> <P> They said they were minding their own business , just a bunch of guys named Roger Maris , 30 , Clete Boyer , 28 , Joe DiMaggio and Hal Reniff having a quiet snort in a dark bar after a hard day at the Yankees ' Fort Lauderdale training camp . But Male Model Jerome Modzelewski , at the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Maris says Jerome kept damning the four Yankees . Anyhow , Modzelewski wound up with a badly cut lip , eleven stitches and the distinct impression that Maris was going for 61 . He charged Roger and Clete with assault and battery . Impossible , says Roger , who has only clouted one over the fence so far this year , " I thought everybody knew I 'm not much of a spring hitter . " <P> <P> Shanghai was the word for this operation . Some colleagues on Capitol Hill were dedicating a hearing room in honor of Carl Vinson , 81 , retired chairman of the House Armed Services Committee . The crusty old statesman characteristically replied that he was " too busy " for such foofaraws . So out to Milledgeville , Ga. , went an innocent phone call from the White House asking him to come spend the weekend . Of course Vinson accepted . And of course L.B.J. hustled him right over for the dedication ceremonies , where the President recalled his own days as a very junior member of Vinson 's committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled Johnson , until one day he started asking questions about a proposed base near Corpus Christi , only to be told by Vinson to " get rid of these local issues . " " That got my dander up , " continued Lyndon , " so I said , ' Surely I am entitled to four questions-one for each year . ' " Squelched Vinson : " All right . You asked three . You have one more to go . " <P> <P> He might be married , with two kids , stand only 5 ft. 1 in. in his socks and wear his hair like a scrub brush . But he was obviously going places , and so Andrea Kline , a Queens teen , picked Astronaut Gus Grissom , 39 , for her private hero four years ago , sent him letters and gifts and kept hoping that one day . . . Now Gus and John Young were safely down from their Gemini voyage into space , and in Manhattan for the parades and banquets . Into the Waldorf-Astoria marched Andrea , and ran right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of square Florentine cuff links and a tie clasp , then burst into tears . No emergency procedures for Gus . He just introduced her as " my Number One fan , " gave her his chair and sat on the floor while the mayor spoke . " We made it , Gus and I , " sighed Andrea , 16 . " We both made it . " <P>
