Walking quietly into Washington 's Union Station one afternoon last week to entrain for a Princeton trustees ' meeting , former CIA Chief Allen Dulles found himself in unexpected company . On the lookout for his own train , he ambled into a crowd gathered on a platform , quickly realized his mistake . Asked Dulles , peering around in puzzlement : " What is this ? " Newsmen quickly told him what it was : a reception committee for Anatoly Fedorovich Dobrynin , 42 , who arrived in the U.S. last week as the Soviet Union 's new Ambassador to the U.S. <P> Wearing a fashionable black Chesterfield overcoat , the tall , polished Dobrynin stepped off the midday express from New York with his attractive brunette wife Irina Nikolaevna at his side . Russian embassy staffers showered him with roses , thrust out carnations . Dobrynin lost no time in dispensing his own roses . Smiling graciously and speaking in slightly accented English , he quoted Thomas Jefferson on the " remarkable similarity " between Americans and Russians , extended " the friendly greetings of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine and sped off to the Soviet embassy . <P> Ever since former Ambassador Mikhail ( " Smiling Mike " ) Menshikov left Washington in early January , the taciturn Soviet diplomatic delegation has been even quieter than usual under the interim command of Minister Counselor Mikhail Smirnovsky . While it waited for Dobrynin 's arrival , official Washington had had time to ponder his credentials . A skilled diplomat and a top Soviet expert on the U.S. , Dobrynin served at the Soviet embassy in Washington from 1952 to 1955 . Later , at the U.N. , he was Dag Hammarskjold 's Under Secretary for Political and Security Council Affairs . He attended the Geneva summit conference in 1955 and the Kennedy-Khrushchev meeting at Vienna in 1961 . <P> This week or next Dobrynin was to present his credentials to President Kennedy at the White House . Until he got to work , Washington could not be sure whether he was an improvement or not-but there were some encouraging signs . Dobrynin is young , intelligent , and far more relaxed with Americans than Menshikov , whose major trademark was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple , the Dobrynins have unusual social poise , even dress like Americans . On the art-and athletics-conscious New Frontier , they are likely to contribute more than Menshikov to Washington 's social whirl . Both are accomplished skiers ( he also plays tennis ) , and Mrs. Dobrynin plays the piano well , has a broad knowledge of U.S. art and literature . But Washington would be surprised indeed if Dobrynin displayed the one quality that Soviet diplomats , however polished , rarely bring along with them : flexibility .
