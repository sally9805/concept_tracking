Moderate Cantabile is a French movie made by an Englishman , Director Peter Brook ( Lord of the Flies ) . Surprisingly , it seems an authentic French movie ; unhappily , it is not a very good one . Based on a novel by Marguerite Duras , Moderate retells the sad tale of Flaubert 's Emma Bovary as a contemporary case . Poor Emma . She always was a dull little dame , but in 1857 she at least made a social point . <P> In Brook 's film as in Flaubert 's book , the heroine ( Jeanne Moreau ) lives in a French provincial town and is married to a prosperous and proper bourgeois who is even duller than she is . She is bored , she falls in love with a younger man ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) , she loses him . At this point , Flaubert 's heroine kills herself . Brook 's heroine , alas , owes rather less to Flaubert than she does to Freud . Her drama is not a tragedy of society but a crisis of identity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even her own , " her lover observes . Her undoing does not lead to death but to a death wish- " I wish you were dead , " he rages , and she replies , " I am . " <P> Moderate Cantabile might better have been titled Adagio Funereo ; it is much too long , much too lugubriously languid . On the other hand , Director Brook 's musical score-he developed it himself from a sonatina by Diabelli - is sensuous and tender . And Armand Thirard 's photography is almost too dreamily lovely to believe . The film was actually shot at Blaye on the River Gironde , and in Thirard 's frames , the big river , the wide land , the vast sky and the quiet clouds all seem to be shimmering mysteriously in the depths of a tremendous pearl .
