txt Mail : Tips for the Tippers ALBERT J. FRANCK.MRS . EDGAR H. RUE.MALCOLM J. CAMPBELL.ALEXANDER STERNE.THOMA ... Mail : Tips for . the Tippers To THE EDITOR : THIS is to amplify Mark Dpnald 's article on tipping ( Travel Section of April 23 ) . There is no tipping in Iceland , and it is not customary in Finland because a service charge makes it unnecessary . tins do . not tip cab drivers or bartenders . It is generally unnecessary in Japan , as Mr. Donald pointed out , and in the Scandinavian countries , where there is ' a service charge in the bill , odd bits of small change can be left on the ' table and will not be considered insulting . Nevertheless , Americans tend generally to augment these leavings in view of their modesty in terms of American values . ? Reprints of that article should  --  be in the hands of all tourists bound for places abroad , especially firsttimers . A reminder that airline employes should never be tipped might be appended to the reprints . ALBERT J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR : I wish to take issue with John Rentauk 's rebuttal to the letter of Jahn Anderson of Victoria , Australia . It seems to me that we Americans should try to improve our national image in ? the eyes of foreigners by acknowledging some of our discourtesies and doing am-dething about them , instead of being so defensive . Mr. Rentauk has apparently never been in that part of the world from which Mr. Anderson hails , for , hi referring to tipping , he says that " many ' of these practices originated in your part of the world and were imported to our shares . " I have just returned from nearly three mouths in Australia and New Zealand , where tipping is not customary and where . the service is always courteous and cheerfully given . In New Zealand , tipping is actually frowned upon . Never in my nearly 40 years of travel on five continents have I met with such hospitality , friendliness , courtesy and helpfulness , all without tips . I can greatly appreciate Mr. Anderson 's reaction ? to our grudgingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. RuE . Brooklyn . TIPPED BY A CABBIE To THE EDITOR : I hasten to correct a wrong impression that the letter of John Rentauk might have left . He made the very valid point that tipping was demanded as assiduously on the far side of the Atlantic as it is on this side . But he ventured onto much less firm ground in suggesting that the practice originated in Australia . I recently paid a visit to my home city in Australia , and I hive fresh in my mind the looks of surprise that greeted the tips I absentmindedly left in modest restaurants . The most vivid memory , however , concerns taking a cab ride in downtown Sydney , and being tipped by the cab driver . It was only a few cents , to be sure , but I can not recollect anything similar ever occurring in . New York . MALCOLM J. CAMPBELL . Ithaca , N.Y . RATES ARE RELATIVE To THE EDITOR : I was amazed and astounded by the letter of Mrs. Noel B. Fox , in which she defends Practice Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housing agency for Expo 67 in Montreal . Mrs. Fox writes . that " the rates are only $22 a day , plus tax . " In expensive Paris , I have been paying $5 a day for a room and shower . In Florence , I can get a room , plus two meals , for $6 a day . In Lisbon , I have paid $3.85 a day for a room with three meals , including wine and coffee . Last year , I spent a ? month on the island of Mykonos , in Greece . My rent for the Month was $50 . In November , I stayed in a very elegant hotel in Tangiers , where I paid $18 a day for a room , bath , breakfast and dinner ( with wine served by six waiters ) . Even in Russia , which is dreadfully expensive , " de luxe " class costs $35 a day for a suite , three ? meals and the use of a car , with a private guide , for three hours a day . I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter and begin charging us " only " $22 a day . ALEXANDER STERNE . New . York . AMERICA 'S APATHY To THE DITOR : A photograph accompanying . an article of April 23 , " Dawn River Front California 's Capital , " reveals a virtually endless ' vista of pilings in Port Costa. , a " busy port in the 1880 's . " Could anything other than automobile graveyards and the abandoned ' nine shafts encountered in Pennsylvania more graphically attest to America 's apathy and indifference to beauty ? If for no other reason than that of ? potential profit , to abandon an area that might prove suitable for boating and swimming appears shortsighted . Removing the remains of what once , were warehouse storage piers obviously entails same expense ; part of such expenditures certainly would be compensated by the tourist trade , which , even now , shows a tentative sort of interest . The tendency of homo sapiens to foul his own nest may not be news to most of us , but  --  it warrants continuing emphasis . In ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas is a task to which we shall be obliged to devote ourselves unremittingly . THOMAS G. MORGANSU Jackson Heights , N.Y . ABOUT TRAINS To THE EDITOR : The Travel Section mail column has turned up some letters about standees on Italian trains . Two years ago , we traveled **25;555;TOOLONG , and had no difficulty reserving seats . Why stand when a reservation can be obtained easily , and for only a few pennies extra ? And , to refer to Dorothy Larson 's letter of April 23 , we shared a snack with a delightful Italian woman on the trip to Naples , even though our only Italian was favors and grade , both mixed with a smile , and , as the train progressed , with a few hearty laughs . The corridor was jammed with standees , mostly a contingent of Alpine troops drinking beer and having a whale of a good time in a really friendly way . The sign language carried us all , including the Italians , on a pleasant journey . By all means , ride the trains in Italy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York : TELEPHONE LISTINGS TO THE EDITOR : Your reprint of the article , " I 'm in the Copenhagen Phone Book , " on April 23 was much appreciated , and it was certainly correct in what was reported there . There is , however , another Scandinavian peculiarity on this subject that was not mentioned ? the listing of , names in Icelandic telephone books , In Iceland , relatively few families carry family names ; the majority of people are known simply by their given name followed by their father 's first name with the suffix " - son " or " - dottir " ( daughter ) . This use of first names is carried into any alphabetic listing of names , including Iceland 's telephone directory . Thus , the entry of a friend of mine is " Jon R. SigurJonsson , vidskfr . " His name would be found under " J , " not " S. " As is customary in Denmark , his title ( abbreviation for business manager ) accompanies his name . A wife does not take on her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the wife of Hennes Sveinsson . It has always been a mystery to me how the mailmen delivering mail to an apartment house know where to deposit letters addressed to married women , since there is no way of telling who a woman is married to when just seeing her name .

DELAYS AT KENNEDY To THE EDITOR : If our efforts to attract tourists b the United States are to be anything but the emptiest of gestures , something must be done to correct the intolerable situation now existing at Kennedy International Airport . On April 30 , my wife and I arrived after an excellent flight from Europe . We stayed in line approximately 40 minutes before reaching the desk of the Immigration inspector , for whom I had nothing but the fullest sympathy . He was working his heart out against impossible odds . Much of the delay appeared to stem from the comparatively lengthy processing required on foreign- passports . In no European country that we had visited were the Immigration formalities for foreign visitors anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks could be set up for the foreign visitors we want and expect . They should be manned by multilingual inspectors , and the processing should be confined to the absolute irreducible minimum . I heard several thoroughly uncomplimentary comments , in several languages , during the long wait . By contrast , Customs inspection was , although careful , pleasant and expeditious . The Customs Service should be complimented on the unusually friendly and courteous attitude exhibited by inspectors , even under pressure . R. M. F. New York .
