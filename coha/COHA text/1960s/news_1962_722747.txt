txt Letters to The Times pg . 38 Letters to The Times Moving Toward Peace Replacing International Hatred With Tolerance Urged The writer of the following letter is a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia , Circuit . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Many people think events have justified President Kennedy 's toughness in the Cuban crisis . This is a little like thinking that if a man plays " Russian roulette " and escapes death the event proves that his act was reasonable . The great differences between the two cases are ' obvious . On the one hand , the President sought to promote the public good . On the other hand , he risked many millions of lives besides his own . Removal of the Cuban bases does not make us safe . We were unsafe before they were there and shall still be unsafe when they are gone . The Russians could wipe us out , as we could wipe them out , from domestic bases and submarines . As the President has said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to another with a warhead and with a great degree of accuracy . " But removal of the Cuban bases evidently reduces our insecurity in some degree . And the crisis and its solution may have increased mutual readiness to negotiate other issues . These are important gains . But it does not follow that it is wise to go to the brink of nuclear war in the hope that , with luck , such gains may follow . Making Voices Heard We have gained also a sort of prestige . The President is not obsessed by prestige , but many politicians and publicists are . Many would have gone farther and faster toward nuclear war than the President did . These men make their voices heard . We who want peace must make our voices heard . By word and deed the President has repeatedly emphasized negotiation , and we have negotiated , but too often from an inflexible position and againstra background of bombs , Unless the President has reconsidered , he would start a. nuclear war rather than agree to unwelcome changes in the status of West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , which h sometimes misunderstood , is to us ( whatever weapons are necessary to preserve our vital interests . Quit ( clearly , we consider access to Berlin a vital interest . " Why is this a " vital interest " ? To suggest that because of our commitments to the people of West Berlin we are bound in honor to start a nuclear war if we can not protect them otherwise is to think in terms of a national morality that was inherited from the pre-nuclear age and makes no sense today . The suggestion means that we are under a moral obligation to make the world " a flaming pyre " in order to protect the people of West Berlin . Protecting People Before nuclear weapons were invented it might be thought that a successful war could meet some national obligation or preserve some national interest . But both President Kennedy and President Eisenhower have stressed the evident fact that ' no one can win a nuclear war . It follows that a nuclear war can not meet any obligation or preserve any interest . To suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would be among its first victims , is fantastic . The President said at the United Nations on Sept. 24 , 1961 : " We shall be remembered either as the generation that turned this planet into a flaming pyre or the generation that met its vow ' to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ' . " Though " vow " is figurative , " flaming pyre " is a literal description of what nuclear war would make of the United States , its neighbors , Russia and most of Europe . Since nuclear knowledge can not be unlearned ' or prevented from spreading , we can not long survive without universal disarmament and world government . We can take some limited unilateral steps toward peace , such as dismantling our Turkish bases , withdrawing from southeast Asia and ceasing to make nuclear tests . But the most important step toward peace that we can take is a change of attitude . The need is urgent to move away from international hatred and toward international tolerance . HENRY W. EDGERTON . Washington , Nov. 9 , 1962 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW YORK TIMES : I would like to reply to Merlin W. Packard 's letter published Nov. 6 . I can understand how Christians might object to the reminder that , long before Christianity , . the winter solstice was celebrated as the return of the sun to the northern hemisphere , though this does not necessarily prevent them ( the Christians ) from holding to their own reasons for keeping that season holy . But as the hard-working secretary of the Church-State Committee of The New York Chapter of the American Humanist Association , I ca n't see how a secularized winter-Solstice stamp is a threat to separation of church and state , nor in what manner it is the exploitation of a " religious observance . " Even when I was a good and earnest little Presbyterian child , Christmas , to me , meant Santa Claus , Christmas trees , stockings hung  --  nothing religious . I venture to guess this is , and has been , true of most children . Christmas , I fear , has long been mainly a folk festival . DOROTHEA THAYER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parks City Planner Notes Superiority of London 's Squares TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Recent comparisons prompt me to list some factors essential to an understanding of the reasons for the superiority of London 's parks over those of New York : The pleasure afforded by a park and its durability are both functions of intensity of use . If the population to be served is excessive , the hardiest grass in the most favorable climate will not survive . The highest density permitted in a handful of strategic sections of London 's center is 200 persons ( about 60 dwellings ) an acre . The rest of the city 's center is zoned for between 100 and 136 persons ( or 28 to 40 dwellings ) an acre . In contrast , Manhattan 's residential areas are zoned for 200 to 400 dwellings an acre  --  from three and a half to seven times London 's highest density . The inadequacy of Manhattan 's parks can not be offset by such distant facilities as Van Cortlandt , Pelham Bay , La Tourette , Jamaica Bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an occasional weekend trek but should be available for daily use . Refuges From Stresses London 's neighborhoods are full of squares , public and private , which are sacrosanct refuges from the stresses of the modern metropolis . Here , on the other hand , an aroused citizenry had to fight to save Washington Square , the only substantial park ( though quite small , by London standards ) serving Greenwich Village and ' the fastgrowing lower Fifth Avenue neighborhood . London is creating sizable ( 27-acre to 135-acre ) new parks in heavily populated areas . Here , the pressure for increased densities in redevelopment areas seems to be almost irresistible . London 's firmness in withstanding speculative pressures is a major component of its successful park policy . London is not afraid of committing itself to a specific , clearly stated physical plan that permits acquisition of two-acre , to three-acre parcels ( which may be all the city can afford at a given time ) which eventually become parks of 135 acres . Only by relatively inflexible allegiance to such a specific plan can the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an area is completed . Density Policy The essential ingredient of London 's success is , however , the first factor mentioned above , its sound population density policy . With great courage , London accepted the conclusion that if fewer people are to live in a given area in the future than live there today , the excess must be accommodated elsewhere . To make this possible , Britain launched its unique New and Expanded Towns programs , under which in the last 10 years or so some 400,000 persons , amply supplied with employment opportunities and community facilities , have been housed well beyond London 's suburban belt . To ask for better parks is not enough . Better parks can only be part of a better city . It is time New York abandoned the myth that the ' accumulated greeds of eight million people will add up to something worth while . To become a better city , New York must emulate more of London 's achievements than the pretty lawns and flowers of its parks . GEORGE M.
