txt Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said yesterday that the Supreme Court 's ruling on Monday that a suspect must be informed of his right to remain silent and to have counsel " will certainly restrict us in our effectiveness . " " There should be some diminishing of law and order " as a result , he observed . Speaking at a news conference in Police Headquarters , the Commissioner said that in the aftermath of the 5-4 court ruling " it 's quite possible that a great number of persons who are in fact guilty will not be successfully prosecuted . " " We just wo n't be able to offer the district attorneys and the courts as much evidence , " Mr. Leary declared . Other Cases in Doubt The impact of the high court 's ruling put numerous cases in doubt , among them the highly publicized indictments of George Whitmore Jr . and Richard Robles . Whitmore was charged , and later cleared , in the murders of Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert . He is now serving a prison term for attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life term for the double slaying of the East Side career girls . Confessions played a major role in the convictions of both // Whitmore and Robles . Neither had been advised of his right to remain silent or his right to counsel . The high courrs decision , one of several in recent years that have curbed the power of the police in interrogating suspects , threw the department into what one West Side precinct corn'mander called " a state of flux . " Reactions ranged from " at the moment it just looks black " to " let 's wait and see what happens . " Commissioner Leary , speaking softly , said : " Our experience is that there is being developed sophisticated law for an immature society . " " All decisions from the Supreme Court recently , " he said , " always favor the accused and the defendants , and are greatly concerned with their rights . How far and how long are the rights of the accused to be considered , with little regard for the rights of the victim ? " Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the detective squad room in one of the city 's 80 precincts and questioned . " The suspect had to request an attorney , " a police captain in the heart of Brooklyn declared . " Now , apparently , we ca n't even ask a single question . " " It looks very grim , " he added , " but in the long run it May have good effects because now you 'll have to come up with more scientific techniques to solve crime . " ' Guidelines ' Prepared Commissioner Leary , at his news conference , noted that Franklin A. Thomas , the Deputy Commissioner in charge of legal affairs , was drawing up " the proper orders for guidelines " to policemen as a result of the court decision . " That 's our first consideration now , " Mr. Leary said . " You have the law of the land and you have to obey it . " Mr. Leary said that the court decision was " not totally and completely new to me . " In Philadelphia , where he had been Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform defendents of their right to counsel following an order by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit . " It restricted effectiveness , " Mr. Leary remarked . Shortly before Mr. Leary was named New York 's Police Commissioner last February , he announced in Philadelphia that 1.7 per cent fewer arrests were made in 1965 than in 1964 . At the time he blamed recent court decisions . Recent court rulings also came under fire yestrday from James Kelly , president of the Detective Endowment Association . In a message in the June issue of the D. E. A. Bulletin , a publication of the association , Detective Kelly asserted : " More and more the central topic of inquiry in judicial proceedings involves the conduct of the police officers . rather than the issue of guilt or innocence . " One policeman , though , who did not appear too worried by the high court 's ruling was the New York State Police Superintendent , Arthur Cornelius Jr . He said the ruling " will not affect the procedures " of the state police since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right to counsel and his right to remain silent .
