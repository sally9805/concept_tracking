At nine . Barry Babcock was the littlest boy in the Temple City , Calif .. Little League . But he had already put in one year patiently serving as his team 's bat boy , and last week Barry got his chance to play . His father , Jack Babcock. watched proudly from the stands as Barry stepped into the batter 's box . <P> <P> On the mound . Pitcher Mike Hanes. 10 , wound up and threw a soft , slow curve . As Barry turned to swing , the ball hit him on the chest . The youngster dropped his bat , staggered backward , collapsed in the arms of Umpire Al Millham. and died . Improbably , the mild impact had stopped Barry 's heart . Pitcher Hanes collapsed in hysterics . But like so many Little League parents , grief-stricken Jack Babcock showed a stubborn concern for the game . " I hope this does n't curtail Little League ball , " said Babcock . " Barry would n't want that . He loved baseball more than anything in life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
