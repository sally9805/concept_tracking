txt If a transistor radio is advertised for " less than $10 , " does the customer assume $10 is the usual price and anything less is a bargain ? Is it deceptive for a book club to advertise a " free book " when the ad says the customer must buy six other volumes to obtain the so-called free one ? These and other prickly questions , impor ? tent to both the nation 's advertisers and consumers , are being tackled here this morning in an unusual public meeting between business and Government . The Federal Trade Commission , which polices dishonest advertising , believes some retailers and manufacturers recently have been attempting to sell " bargains " with new techniques which , though not yet ruled Illegal by any court , are nevertheless deceiving customers . But instead of promptly ordering a halt , as they could do , the five commissioners are hearing what business sf the practices . The business spokesmen will sail Into some of the commission 's proposed remedies for the suspect advertising techniques ' , and their opinions are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek in the next month to lay down firm do 's and don't 's for business to live by . Major Business Groups Starting at 10 this morning a parade of executives , trade association officials and lawyers will present their views to the commission . Among more than a dozen major business groups represented will be the National Better Business Bureau , National Retail Furniture Association , National Retail Merchants Association , Automobile Service Industries , American Retail Federation and American Apparel Manufacturers Association . So many are anxious to testify that each witness is being limited to 15 minutes , but nevertheless the meeting already is being extended to a second day . This Is n't the FTC 's first attempt to define what constitutes a bargain . Not only does the commission wrestle with the question constantly in Scrutinizing thousands of individual ads , but in 1958 It issued guidelines , which are still in force , to tell businessmen what it considered deceptive pricing under the Federal Trade Commission Act . In effect . the guidelines declare : " It 's illegal to say you 're offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus if a retailer marks a toaster " list price $10 , our price $7.98 , " the " list price " must honestly reflect the toaster 's actual cus. tomary selling price in that community . And a retailer ca n't advertise a " reduced price " if he actually made very few sales at the original , higher price . Now the commission has drawn up a proposed revision of these guidelines , extending them to new comparative-price advertising techniques and reopening some old questions . For the most part , the revisions propose greater restrictions on advertisers , but the commissioners are n't yet convinced they should in fact move in this direction . " Businessmen In Dilemma " " Many of our guidelines raise very basic Issues , " says one commissioner . " We need to reconsider how harmful some of our past prohibitions have been , relative to economic growth and relative to the actual extent of consumer deception . " Another commissioner says : " A lot of businessmen feel they 're in a dilemma . If they sell at the manufacturer 's list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , they may be accused of deceptive pricing . " Among new techniques to be discussed today is the advertising of a price as " less than " a given dollar figure , which has gained popularity among photographic equipment makers . The commission , in its proposed guidelines , says consumers assume the dollar figure mentioned is " the product 's approximate maximum retail value " and it may he used if " a substantial and significant number or sales are actually made at or near the ' less than ' price . " Manufacturers are expected to protest that it would be difficult for them to be sure they were properly satisfying this requirement . However , some commissioners may argue that the proposed guideline is too liberal because consumers tend to view the dollar figure as a " list price " and mentally calculate their " saving " accordingly . Another term , not covered in the 1958 guidelines but up for debate today , is " discount price . " The FTC , suggests this should be interpreted to mean that the usual price in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount price . " But the National Association of Food Chains will object that this definition could be unfair to supermarkets because their sales margins are " extremely narrow " and competitive price-cutting is limited to " relatively small price reductions . " Today 's session will subject some old problems to new examination . On the question of " free " offers , the commission wonders whether it should abandon its present guideline , which permits advertising using the word " free " provided it 's clearly stated what a customer must do to obtain the giveaway and provided the price of a for-sale item is n't inflated to cover the cost of the " free " one . The possible alternative : A return to the FTC 's pre , 1953 ban on " free " if the offer required a consumer to make any purchase benefiting the advertiser . Under this old rule , an FTC lawyer concedes , " they practically had to be on the street corner handing it out . " And similar objections will be heard from business today . One trade association will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer are clearly stated , " this does not confuse or mislead the customer . Moreover , we believe that the practice has a salutary effect on the movement of merchandise . " Such arguments about economic impact are likely to carry some weight with the commissioners . In some proposals , the FTC is suggesting legally acceptable means of living with existing regulations in certain awkward situations . One problem : If a manufacturer 's product sells at a variety of prices in a certain area , under present FTC guidelines the company may not advertise a specific " suggested list price " in that area . Now the commission proposes that the manufacturer may advertise a " generally , prevailing range of prices . " But this could create a new problem for the manufacturer ; all consumers might well expect to obtain the lowest price in the range . Another guideline is proposed to help the retailer who ca n't sell a certain product at the original price and is forced to reduce it . In this situation , present guidelines say , the merchant ca n't mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . Under the new proposal , he could advertise an item at $8 and add : " Previously offered but not sold at $10 . " Comments one trade association official : " This is an awfully difficult phrase . A lot of retailers would be reluctant to use it . " Some witnesses will suggest today that the commission permit " previously offered at $10 " and spare the merchant the embarrassment of ladmitting he could n't sell the item at that price .
