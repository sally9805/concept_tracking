Seneca said that art imitates nature . <P> But last week in Madrid , nature followed art in one man 's brave and ec centric act of self-fulfilling prophecy . Precisely at noon on Sunday , 42-year-old Gonzalo Arias hung a brace of white posters over his shoulders and began to stroll down thronged Calle de la Princesa . The message , in black letters fore and aft , was simple : " In the Name of the Spanish People , I respectfully ask that free elections be held for the head of state . " It was not the sort of thing that happens every Sunday afternoon in Spain , and heads spun as Arias paraded past crowded cafe tables . The consensus was that the man with the sign was out of his head . <P> Nine minutes after the start of his walk , a black sedan zoomed toward Arias . Three plainclothesmen got out , collected Arias and drove him off to police headquarters . And that , it seemed , was that-unless one had read a novel published in Paris last spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly like Madrid , a man wearing posters calling for free elections would stroll down a crowded street . The author of the novel was , of course , Arias . <P> Nonviolent Ideals . Was his gesture merely a publicity stunt for the novel ? Or was Arias , for twelve years a translator for UNESCO , simply a trifle loco ? Jean-Marie Domenach , a French Catholic intellectual , calls Arias a " deeply convinced , well-balanced man . " Arias himself , who is devoted to the nonviolent ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King , feels that " if I ask other people to be active in a nonviolent campaign in Spain , no one will do anything . That 's why I must set an example . " His wife says : " He simply has the courage of his convictions . " <P> Those convictions , as his novel , Los Encartelados ( The Poster People ) , makes clear , center on the theme of democratic government for his country . And his hopes , as outlined in the book , are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will follow in his footsteps . Eventually , so his vision goes , the streets of Spain will be jammed each Sunday by the encartelados bearing silent but effective witness to the dream of change . Initially , just as his book predicts , the public reaction in Madrid was sympathetic but skeptical . " It might work elsewhere , " a student said , " but it 's like a fly running into a stone wall here . " Indeed , Arias was quickly indicted for two violations of the penal code . His brief walk for freedom could cost him from one month to six years in prison . <P> As the week ended , Arias was still in police custody , as was Felix Villamedial , a 32-year-old teacher who donned a poster shortly after Arias set off . There were reports that more encartelados might be appearing soon in other Spanish cities .
