AERONAUTICS &; SPACE <P> For its part in the Paris Air Show , the U.S. went all out , displaying sophisticated aircraft and spacecraft and flying two Sikorsky jet helicopters last week from Brooklyn all the way to Le Bourget Airport-the first nonstop crossing of the North Atlantic by whirlybird ( they were refueled en route ) . Britain and France also put their best fleet forward with striking new military and civilian aircraft and a full-scale model of their jointly developed supersonic transport , the Concorde . But it was the Russians who stole the show , simply by taking the wraps off space hardware-some of it a decade old-that they had never before displayed in the West . <P> The greatest Soviet surprise was the launch vehicle that in 1961 sent Pioneer Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit in Vostok I. Although envious Western space experts have long assumed that a single giant booster had been used to launch Vostok and later Soviet spacecraft , the vehicle displayed at Paris consisted of a relatively small two-stage rocket surrounded by a cluster of four conical , strap-on rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology believed by the West to have made the Gagarin flight possible , the Russians had simply strapped together enough smaller rocket engines to provide the necessary thrust . <P> Sky Spy . Visitors at the show flocked to a huge mock-up of the 13.6-ton Proton satellite , which the Russians call a scientific-research vehicle . Space experts who examined the mock-up last week were reasonably certain , however , that the Proton is a prototype of one of the sections of a manned orbital-reconnaissance vehicle or even of a lunar landing craft that will be assembled in orbit before heading to the moon . The Proton on display in Paris consists of an 8-ft - diameter core section surrounded by a 14.8-ft. - diameter outer shell that could contain instrumentation and life-support systems . U.S. space experts suggest that the outer shell could serve as a shield to protect the craft against micrometeorite hits during prolonged or biting of the earth or a lunar trip . <P> The Soviets also showed a model of their advanced Molniya communications satellite , which in synchronous orbit over Siberia can relay color TV between Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls and taken weather pictures of the earth 's cloud cover . Molniya was cluttered with so many unlabeled antennas and sensor systems that scientists figured that the satellite was also capable of serving a " spy in the sky " function over the U.S.
