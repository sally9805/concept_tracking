I have not always been wrong about the future of events and , if you will permit me . I shall inscribe some of these words as my testament because I should like to be held accountable for them in years which I shall not see . <P> With that request of Winston Spencer Churchill , taken from a wartime speech . ABC this week began a television series worthy of its subject and his words . Called Winston Churchill-The Valiant Years , its 26 half-hour segments will draw material from all six volumes of Church ill 's World War II memoirs , using film clips made on both sides of battle to provide-if all episodes prove as excellent as the first-a graphic and unforgettable text in modern history . <P> Skillfully selected and edited , the series ' opener traced both Churchill and his country through the years that bridged the wars , from bursting shells among the trenches of 1918 to the first aerial bombardments of 1940 . One fine vignette followed another : Churchill sitting in a wheelchair in Manhattan , bandages on his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Fifth Avenue in 1931 ; Hitler barking Sieg , Sieg , in antiphony with the full-throated Heils of massed Germans ; the odd and sinister British-Nazi faction of Sir Oswald Mosley goose-stepping in Hyde Park ; the garden walls hand-built by Churchill during his enforced retirement at Chartwell ; later shots of Winston Churchill walking the deck of a British battleship , wearing bow tie and bowler and carrying a cane . First Lord of the Admiralty once more , after the message had gone out to His Majesty 's fleet , " Winston is back . " What really put the ABC series in flight were the words behind the pictures , the prose of Churchill spoken in the Elizabethan voice of Actor Richard Burton , an apt combination that gives The Valiant Years the ring of a historical drama , whether describing prewar England as a " fat , valuable cow tied up to attract the beast of prey " or Hitler as a " bloodthirsty guttersnipe " who would be " sponged and purged and blasted from the surface of the earth . " <P> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is because the producers have hired an impressive list of expert writers , from Quentin Reynolds ( The Battle of Britain ) , William L. Shirer ( Berlin Diary ) and Richard Tregaskis ( Guadalcanal Diary ) , to Hollywood Scenarists Beirne Lay Jr . ( 12 O'Clock High ) and Robert Pirosh ( Battleground ) . And firmly but unobtrusively in the background is a suitably martial , original musical score written by Richard Rodgers .
