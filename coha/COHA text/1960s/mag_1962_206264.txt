When Presidential Candidate John F. Kennedy promised that he would pick each federal judge not by " his political party but his qualifications for the office , " many welcomed his words as a pledge to scrap the ancient prerogative of the President to salt the federal bench heavily with members of his own party . But Kennedy , once in office , found the temptation politically irresistible . He renominated three Eisenhower candidates for the bench , but of the first 95 appointees picked by his own Administration , there was nary a Republican . Last week , Kennedy finally got around to appointing his first G.O.P. judge : Jesse Ernest Eschbach , 41 , who was nominated to the U.S. District Court for Indiana . <P> Small-town Lawyer Eschbach has harbored an ambition to be a federal judge ever since he was in Indiana University 's School of Law-but it long looked as if he might not make it . He served a hitch in the wartime Navy between college and law school , later settled down to a general law practice in Warsaw , Ind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law for a couple of years to try his hand as an officer of a furniture-manufacturing company . Though he has dabbled in politics , he has never held elective office , was not widely known in his state . Kennedy cast his lightning at Warsaw on the recommendation of an old law-school associate of Eschbach 's , Indiana 's Democratic Senator Vance Hartke-even though Eschbach 's county gave Richard Nixon 13,539 votes to Kennedy 's 5,839 in 1960 . <P> The Administration intends to appoint about ten more Republicans among the 38 judgeships that remain to be filled . Like Eschbach , most of them will probably get appointments in areas that are already solidly Republican ( and are thus not likely to be swayed by federal favors ) or in populous states ( New York , Illinois and California ) where several Democrats have already been chosen and the party is satisfied . Once this is done , Kennedy 's score on partisanship will be little different from that of his predecessors : Roosevelt named 208 Democrats and 8 Republicans , Truman 129 Democrats and 13 Republicans , Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has given Kennedy generally good marks for the quality of his selections to date , feels that he missed an unusual chance to continue the partisan balance left by Eisenhower ( 161 Republicans , 160 Democrats ) . But the demands of party loyalty are strong-and no one really expected that Jack Kennedy would ignore them .
