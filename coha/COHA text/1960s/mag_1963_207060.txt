To his Australian acquaintances , Soviet Embassy First Secretary Ivan Feodorovich Skripov seemed a likable sort , as Soviet diplomats go . He was a good talker , an enthusiastic partygoer and a back-slapping practical joker who often laced his guests ' beer with vodka , guffawing when they caught on . But amiable Ivan was more than a spoofer . He was also a spy . <P> His escapades began early in 1961 , when he met a trim young woman identified only as " Miss X " at the zoo in Sydney 's Taronga Park and recruited her as a Soviet agent . She seemed willing , but to test her trustworthiness , he conducted a couple of tests , feeding her money-$952 in all-and handing her minor assignments . Once she had to pick up a small cylinder concealed in a water meter ; another time she found one hidden in the iron railing of a stairway . <P> The Black Cross . Skripov then sent her a letter written in invisible ink and signed " Theresa . " With chemical capsules furnished by Skripov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was to pick up a parcel concealed under a tombstone in a cemetery , " the third from the one with a black cross with the letters IHS . " <P> Convinced by now that Miss X was trustworthy , he handed her a big job . She was to deliver a paper-wrapped parcel to a man in Adelaide who would identify himself with a password . What Skripov did not know was that Miss X had been working for Australian intelligence all along , and she simply turned the parcel over to government agents . Inside they found coded transmission timetables for a Soviet radio station , along with a small , high-speed radio message sender . After waiting two anxious months for Miss X to carry out her task , Skripov last week learned what had gone wrong . The Australian government sent a note to the embassy ordering him out of the country in seven days for having made " elaborate preparations for espionage . " Australian officials would not say what secrets Skripov had been seeking , but last week thousands of workers at the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Lovable Diplomat . Australia 's swift expulsion of Skripov is understandable . In 1954 , MVD Colonel Vladimir Petrov , who also had been posing as a lovable diplomat , defected to the West with an armful of secret documents that described widespread Soviet snooping operations Down Under . Caught Redhanded , the Russians broke off diplomatic relations , did not reopen their Canberra embassy for five years . <P> This time , Australia had equally convincing proof-25 photos taken of Skripov 's meetings with Miss X. For the moment , there was no talk of a new breakoff in relations . Moscow prudently announced that Skripov 's boss , Ambassador Ivan F. Kurdiujov , home on sick leave , would not be returning to Australia .
