India rejoiced last week in two victories : the Chinese were thrown back in a local action on the embattled mountain border ; former Defense Minister Krishna Menon , long a virulently anti-Western appeaser of Communism , was thrown out of Nehru 's Cabinet . <P> The new Chinese thrust came after a ten-day lull in the fighting and was apparently aimed at driving down the Luhit River valley toward India 's important oil fields at Digboi , 90 miles from Walong , in the North East Frontier Agency . The Chinese seized a mountain slope above Walong , but Indian troops " went into an attack and cleared this position , throwing back the Chinese aggressors . " <P> Freeze &; Famine . The military good news was long overdue , though minor in scope , and indicated that General Brij Mohan Kaul , 50 , the border commander , was beginning to use to good advantage the U.S. and British automatic weapons and heavy mortars being flown in around the clock . At Kaul 's headquarters in Tezpur , India 's venerable President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of whom had wandered famished and freezing through the mountains for 17 days after the big Chinese breakthrough last month . " Morale is high , " Radhakrishnan told newsmen . " All the troops say , ' Give us the tools and we will regain our lost territory . ' " He blamed last month 's defeat on the fact that India had " trusted the Chinese because we were carrying on negotiations with them . Our credulity and our negligence cost us the initial reverse . " Survivors of the attack were still angrily asking why they had been so outgunned by the Chinese , whose light , automatic weapons fired at a rate 20 times faster than the single-shot Lee Enfield rifle , standard in the Indian army . Said a senior Indian officer : " The troops feel they have been let down . " <P> So did all India . Chief blame for the nation 's unreadiness continued to be placed on Menon , who as Defense Minister since 1957 was reluctant to buy arms abroad and , in his socialist suspicion of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts . Military orders were funneled into state-run arsenals that were supposed to turn out everything from jet fighters to harness straps for army mules . Most of Menon 's arsenals are still in the blueprint stage . <P> Hunched &; Silent . Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , who sees qualities in Menon invisible to others , was reluctant to fire his friend of 30 years . At first he tried to pacify critics by taking over the Defense Ministry himself and downgrading Menon to Minister of Defense Production . Nehru 's task was not made any easier when Menon arrogantly told newsmen , " I am still a member of the Cabinet and still sitting in the Defense Ministry . " Army officers , the press , politicians and delegations from Nehru 's ruling Congress Party all joined in demanding that Menon go . <P> Nehru pleaded , accurately enough , that he too was responsible for India 's defense policy failures . But at last he gave in . As Menon sat near by , hunched and silent , Nehru told a meeting of Congress Party M.P.s that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislators cheered . Menon 's defiant last words : " I still have a bright political future . " No one believed it .
