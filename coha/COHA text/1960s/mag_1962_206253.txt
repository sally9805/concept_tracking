CASSANDRA AT THE WEDDING ( 226 pp. ) - Dorothy Baker-Houqhton Mifflin ( $4 ) . <P> <P> When Dorothy Baker published Young Man with a Horn ( 1938 ) , the thinly disguised story of the great jazz trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke , expectations for her future ran high . The book evoked the bravura of the jazz cult with dash and devotion , if also a dash of sentimentalism . Her two subsequent novels remained merely promising . Cassandra is her long-awaited fourth novel , written 24 years after her first , and presumably a mature work . It is a crushing disappointment . <P> The story concerns Cassandra Edwards ' neurotic , domineering attachment for her twin sister Judith . Judy leaves the family ranch in Southern California to study music in the East , returns a year later with a fiance in tow . Cass , studying for a Ph.D . at Berkeley , is panic-stricken . She rushes home to break up the engagement , intends to regain possession of her less brilliant but saner sister 's soul , and go off with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other methods fail , Cass attempts suicide . But Judith and her young man , already secretly married , save her life and their own happiness . Cassandra returns to her highly refined academic loneliness . The book ends with a heavy-footed symbolism-Cass tosses one of her socks off the Golden Gate Bridge , realizing , presumably , that individuality must in the end triumph over twinism . <P> The book flirts fashionably with incest and inversion ( Cass has a curiously susceptible lady psychiatrist ) ; the style is full of mannerisms and cultural snobberies , e.g. , people are not openmouthed but bouche-be . And how is the reader to care about a heroine who says , " Just give me the coup de grace and then have the grce to leave graciously " ?
