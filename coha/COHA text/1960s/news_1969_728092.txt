txt French scientists , using what is generally regarded as the world 's most powerful laser , have generated a succession of tiny thermonuclear explosions . The development is regarded as an important step toward taming the energy of the hydrogen bomb . It also underlines the concern of some physicists that lasers may eventually simplify the design of devastating nuclear weapons . Several Americans laboratories are working with superpowerful lasers and some have detected the release of neutrons indicative of fusion reactions . The French report , however , is the first public claim that a substantial flow of such neutrons has been produced . It is the fusion of deuterium nuclei that releases the energy characteristic of hydrogen bomb explosions . Deuterium is a variety , or isotope , of hydrogen whose nucleus contains a neutron as well as a proton . The fusion reaction , in which two small atomic nuclei , such as those of deuterium , fuse to form a larger one , such as that of helium , is the energy source of the stars , including the sun . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the sun . Hydrogen bombs have to be triggered by an atomic explosion that generates extremes of temperature and pressure . What the French , and some others , have begun to do is to aim an extremely small , intense pulse of light , generated by a laser , at a target of usable material such as deuterium , that has been frozen by chilling to a few degrees above absolute zero ( the absence of all heat ) . This , in the French process , suddenly heats a bit of deuterium to about 15 milllion degrees Fahrenheit and some of the nuclei fuse , releasing a small , but explosive burst of energy . The French laser , which is at the Limeil Weapons Research Center of the French Atomic Energy Commission near Paris . pulses about three times a minute . The resulting explosions arc so small that they can be detected only by sophisticated means . However , it is the hope of experimenters in this field that laser systems can be developed that release more energy than goes into the system . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those in the cylinders of an internal combustion engine , could he harnessed for power generation . Such as system would not require the magnetic " bottles " that have figured in most efforts to control the fusion reaction . Fusion Requirements The role of such bottles is magnetically to confine and squeeze a plasma until it becomes hot enough for the reaction to take place . Plasma Is matter in a gas state with a substantial number of charged particles . Years of research on both sides of the Atlantic have failed to achieve confinements stable , dense and hot enough for this to occur , although progress is still being made . The control of fusion and the development of reactors to exploit it have been the dream of those who see this as a source of unlimited , safe power . The seas contain vast amounts of deuterium and the fusion reaction does not produce the broad range of radioactive residues that constitute ' the chief hazard in the fission reactors now in use . The French achievement was communicated this week by the Compagnie Generale d'Electricite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hadron , Inc. , of Westbury , Long Island . The laser in question uses glass impregnated with a rare earth element ( neodymium ) . It can deliver a pulse of 50 billion watts within five-billionths of a second which , according to American specialists , makes its pulses the most powerful known , at least in the public domain . In the current fusion experiments it has been pulsed at only 4 billion watts . Because of possible military applications , much of the current work on such lasers is being conducted in secret . However , all specialists consulted on the subject yesterday were agreed that the use of lasers to trigger hydrogen bombs was a long way off . Dr. Melvin B. Gottlieb , director of the Plasma Physics Laboratory at the Forrestal Research Center of Princeton University , said present laser systems , including the French one , were far too weak for ' the job . If lasers of the required energy are developed , he added , they will probably he too big for transport in aircraft and would have to be delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that a country with insufficient technology to build an atomic bomb might construct such a cumbersome device . Dr. Gottlieb and others said French leadership in high-power pulsed lasers derives in large measure from generous support by the weapons branch of the Atomic Energy Commission . The United States , they added , has not given such support . Extensive work in the field is thought to be under way in the Soviet Union . The first report of success in releasing fusion neutrons with a laser was made last year by Dr. Nikolai G. Basov of the Lebedev Institute in Moscow . In 1964 he shared a Nobel Prize with his colleague , Aleksandr M. Prokhorov , and Dr. Charles H. Townes of the United States , for their contributions to original development of the laser . The neutron output of last year 's Moscow experiment was meager and , to some , inconclusive . The Soviet approach has been repeated by the Sandia Corporation in Albuquerque , N. M. Extensive experimentation has been conducted by the Princeton group , where the struggle toward the conquest of fusion has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Conn. , has been exploring the technique as a device for generating very hot plasmas in magnetic bottles . However the only group in this country whose stated goal is the generation of energy without such a bottle appears to he that led by Dr. Moshe Lubin at the University of Rochester . Dr. Lubin said yesterday that while his laser does not generate as much energy as the French one , he , too , is obtaining a $thstantial flow of fusion neu/rons . He declined to be specific until he is sure of his figures . The French likewise withheld precise figures but said the intensity of neutrons was sufficient for measurement of their time of flight . That time was found to be characteristic of neutrons released by the fusion of two deuterium nuclei . The fact that time-of-flight measurements were possible indicated to American specialists that the French were producing neutrons in considerable numI bers . Some of those experts consulted yesterday pointed out that regardless of whether or not lasers prove to be practical as a means of releasing fusion energy , they are becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior of plasmas at extremely high temperature .
