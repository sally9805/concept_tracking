Despite all the heady talk about sending men into space in the not too distant future , many a practical problem remains far from solution . One of the most formidable : protecting space travelers from the deadly radiation that will swarm about them . <P> This week General Electric Engineer Norris F. Dow , reporting his findings in Aero/Space Engineering , considered the difficulties of providing radiation shielding for spacemen-and found them immense . <P> When an inhabited satellite orbits 2,200 miles above the earth , its crew will be riddled by the fast-moving protons of the inner Van Allen radiation belt . If unshielded , the spacemen will be inflicted with about 3,000 rem ( the unit of radiation effect on human tissue ) per week many times more than a lethal dose . Even if the satellite stays below the Van Allen radiation , its crew may still be in peril . <P> Flares ( intense disturbances ) on the sun often shoot high-energy protons all the way to earth . During the period July 10-18 , 1959. for example , protons from a sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during each day of orbiting . <P> Shielding can be used to protect the spacemen , but Dow estimated that 100 lbs . of lead per sq . ft. will be required to keep Van Allen or flare radiation at a safe level . That figures at no less than 11,000 Ibs. - more than the total weight of the heaviest satellite yet put into orbit , the U.S.S.R. 's Sputnik III-for shielding in a cramped , man-carrying capsule only six feet in diameter . Dow conceded that better shielding materials than lead may be found . But he saw little chance that the light and roomy satellite stations so dear to space enthusiasts can be made radiation-safe-at least not for a long while .
