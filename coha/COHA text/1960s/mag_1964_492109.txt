The trial of ' Delay ' Beckwith . By Harold H. Martin t op the massive granite-and-limestone Hinds County courthouse in tense Jackson , Miss. , a gigantic statue of Moses holds aloft the ancient Tablets of the Law . Clearly visible in the streets below , as the morning sun falls on the weathered stone , is the admonition of the Sixth Commandment  --  THOU SHALT NOT KILL . On the cold and blowing morning of last January 27 , as Byron De La Beckwith went on trial in this courthouse for the murder of Medgar Evers , an old fat man in faded overalls set out his baskets of hot peanuts , parched and boiled , in front of the building 's great bronzed doors . He stood there all morning , but his sales were few . " They ai n't coming to this trial like I expected , " he said . " l guess they figure there 's no use comin ' to see a show when you know already how it 's going to turn out . " The old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byron De La Beckwith is a while man . Medgar Evers was a Negro  --  and an outspoken leader of the hated N.A.A.C.P. No Mississippi jury in the memory of living men has ever sent a white man to his death for the murder of a Negro . " They 'll acquit him in fifteen minutes , " a florid man in a white jacket said . " The jury 'll go back and play a few hands of Rook , just to make it look like they are studying the evidence . Then they 'll walk back out and turn him aloose . That 'll be all there is to it . " In the somber , dark-paneled courtroom the yellowish light from four huge chandeliers shone on the bearded , moustached and goateed portraits of famed Mississippi jurists of the past , and behind the judge 's bench the tall carved scales of justice hung only slightly askew . All seemed normal . Yet from the moment the case was called , there were signs that this trial might not be just another sardonic charade . On the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , craggily handsome , with a mane of snow-white hair , ran his court with a gentle voice but a firm , unbending dignity . Son of a Jackson policeman , he was a Mississippian , and the customs and traditions of his birthplace were bred deeply in him . Admittedly he was a segregationist , but in his public acts and statements he had never demonstrated the slightest degree of racial bias or prejudice . Nondrinker , nonsmoker , noncusser , a quiet scholar of the law , no outside pressure could sway him except the dictates of a stern Calvinistic conscience . In his courtroom he recognized only one authority , and that was the law . The atmosphere in the courthouse was n't free and easy like it usually was , but solemn and somehow strained . They had set up a table outside the courtroom door , and every man who came to watch had to sign his name , and then a deputy sheriff felt him all over to see if he was totinga pistol . That was all right for the Negroes  --  no telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to try to shoot " Delay " Beckwith ? In the courtroom itself things were even more unusual . The Negro spectators were being allowed to sit anywhere they wanted , instead of clustering all together in the back . If a man wanted to see and hear what was going on , he might have to sit down by a Negro . Or a Negro might come in and sit down by him . Worst of all was out in the halls during recess . A man might walk into a toilet with a big sign on it saying WHITE MEN ONLY , and a Negro could walk right in behind him , and the deputies standing around would n't do a thing about it . It was the judge 's orders , they said , for the courthouse was a public place . The young prosecutor was acting strangely too . William Waller , 37 years old , beginning his second term as district attorney , was a slow , soft-talking , brown-haired , full-faced man . Son of a Delta planter , graduate in law at Ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of this case . Ahead of him lay the prospect of one day sitting there on the bench as circuit judge  --  and the judge 's bench could be a springboard to the State House , or a scat in the United States Senate . Trying this case , he must halve : known , could not help him in Mississippi politics , nor in the private law he practiced on the side . But murder was murder , and he had taken his oath . When Waller was questioning the veniremen , trying to get a jury , he 'd come right out and ask . " Do you believe it 's a crime to kill a nigger in personality  --  jaunty , confident , sometimes even arrogant  --  dominated the room . Trim and erect at 43 , his black hair slicked back over the faint suggestion of a bald spot , he had the air of a man come to receive the homage , not the judgment , of his peers . He would carefully adjust his red necktie , carefully lift his trouser leg to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shirt sleeve so that his French cuffs would be revealed . Then one slim hand on the table , the other resting on the arm of his chair like a man posing for his portrait , he would sweep his eyes over the scattered spectators beyond the rail , nodding and smiling a thin , quick smile as he spotted a familiar face . His was a history that Faulkner might have written  --  the story of a Sartoris whose views on race had made him a hero of the Snopeses . The names of his ancestors were honored in the Delta . His grandmother , Susan Southworth Yerger , came from an old plantation family that once had owned 10,000 acres of rich Delta land . She had been a friend of Mrs. Jefferson Davis , and he had inherited from her a china teacup and saucer and a gravy boat that Mrs. Davis once had owned . His grandfather , Lemuel P. Verger , had gone of at 16 to ride with Nathan Bedford Forrest 's cavalry , and had come home with a bullet in his leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly wearing the honorary title of Colonel . Beckwith himself remembered no great plantations , no summer homes on the gulf . He had been born in Colusa , Calif. , where his mother , a gentle , pretty , brown-eyed woman , had gone to visit an aunt , feeling that a change of scenery would soothe her nerves . There she had married one Byron De La Beckwith , a convivial man who grew grapes and collected guns . The senior Beckwith died when their son was five , and his mother came back to the Delta town of Greenwood to live with her brother , " Mr. Will " Yerger , in a decaying old house their father . The Colonel , had built in 1900 . When Beckwith was 12 his mother died , and he lived on with his Uncle Will , a dreamy-eyed old gentleman who liked to pass out toys and candy to small children in the street . He grew up there in the old dark house with the gentle , addled old man , a lonely small boy with few companions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . Then when he was 20 the war came along . He joined the Marines , fought at Guadalcanal , was wounded at Tarawa . He came home completely changed . Proud , cocky , affecting a black string tie , he would walk down the street jauntily wishing all he met a jovial " top of the morning . " He married and got a job selling snuff , cigarettes and chewing tobacco to little crossroad stores . His acquaintances remember now , with some surprise , that he was pleasant and polite , almost deferential , to the Negro storekeepers who bought his wares . His virulent hatred for the Negro as a race , in fact , did not manifest itself until the Supreme Court 's school decision in 1954 . A Mississippi circuit court judge named Torn P. Brady delivered a vitriolic speech before the Sons of the American Revolution , in which he denounced the court and likened the Negro to a chimpanzee . Beckwith , a member of the Sons , was apparently much impressed by this speech . " That speech , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He became rabid on the race question . I do not say that lightly . " He warred with the rector of his Episcopal Church for his tolerance in racial matters , harassed his fellow members of the Sons of the American Revolution by demanding they pass resolut ions denouncing the Supreme Court . His home life was affected . His wife , tall , dark-haired Mary Louise Beckwith , a former WAVE , was herself a strong segregationist . But Beckwith 's moods made a travesty of their marriage . They were divorced , remarried , divorced and married again . At the time of his arrest they were separated , but as the trial began , she again took her place at his side . As racial tension heightened in Mississippi , Beckwith began distributing his own diatribes in written form , bombarding newspapers with letters to the editor . In one of them , published by the conservative Jackson News H 1957 , he said , " I believe in segregation like 1 believe in God . . . . I shall combat the evils of integration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrationist whoever and wherever he may he . . . " The integrationist leader in Jackson was Medgar Evers . Born and educated in Mississippi , Evers had fought in World War H and in many of his interests and activities he was the counterpart of thousands of white Mississippians . He was a Baptist , a Mason , an Elk , a member of the American Legion and of the Y.M.C.A. He was also field secretary of the N.A.A.C.P. in Mississippi . Evers had tried to persuade his people to register and vote . He had led them on street demonstrations and sit-ins in public places . Worst of all , he had brought suit to integrate the Jackson schools . All through the balmy , flower-scented spring of 1963 tension had been building up between Jackson 's 100,000 whites and 50,000 Negroes . Then on May 28 violence flared . At a ten-cent store four Negro students and a white professor from Tougaloo College had staged a sit-in at a lunch counter . A mob of whites attacked the five . Two were beaten , one severely . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call upon the whole Negro community to take to the streets in protest . When he shouted , " Who 's ready to march ? " the entire audience rose . The city struck back hard . Within the next few days over 500 demonstrators , many of them children , were throe n into paddy wagons and garbage trucks and hauled away to a temporary stockade . " Hell , " said a courthouse official , " our police have to be hard . If they showed any signs of weakness , thousands of white men would take to the streets , shooting every Negro they saw . The fact of the matter is , there are a lot of young , hotheaded Negroes here who are ready to die for what they believe in . And we 've got a lot of white men who are ready to kill them . " White hatred focused on Evers . A fire bomb made of a beer bottle filled with gasoline exploded in the carport of his home . And though his telephone was unlisted , somehow the calls got through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered , " Man , 1 do n't want to kill you . Why should you want to kill me ' ? " But on June 12 someone did . The state claimed it was Beckwith . Slowly , methodically , Bill Waller began to build up his case . Detective Sgt. 0 . X11 . Luke , heavyset , bald to the ears , with a black streak of hair in the middle of his skull , told of finding the ambush spot 200 feet away in a tangle of honeysuckle vines beneath a clump of sweet-gum trees on Missouri Street across from Medgar Evers 's house . He described how on the following morning he had found a .30/06 Enfield rifle , with a telescopic sight on it , hidden carefully in a tangle of vines , 50 feet away from the trampled spot where the killer had hidden . I. Thorne McIntyre Ill , 26 years old , a Delta farmer , took the stand . Young , handsome , Ma el -d ressed , he wore dark glasses of a greenish tint , and the tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told of trading an Enfield .30/06 rifle in 1960 to a man he knew well . He examined the murder gun . " Ilom does this compare with the gun you ov. ned ? " Bill Waller asked . " The type of weapon is identical , " McIntyre replied . " Who did you trade guns with ? " " A man from Greenwood named Delay Beckwith , " McIntyre said slowly ,
