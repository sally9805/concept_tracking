In a grim Moscow prison , two Americans while away the hours of their lonely confinement . They read Dickens , Thackeray and the Bible ; they write letters to their wives . It has been nearly five months since Air Force Lieutenants F. B. Olmstead and John McKone and four companions were shot down in their RB-47 reconnaissance plane over the Barents Sea . The two young officers were captured , brought to Moscow on loudly trumpeted but plainly trumped-up charges of espionage . The body of one fellow airman was returned to the U.S. ; the others are listed as missing . <P> In an eloquent argument before the U.N . at the time , Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge protested that the RB-47 was on a legal reconnaissance flight , well beyond the limits of Russian territorial waters , that the crewmen were in uniform , and that they had made no pretense at concealment . Lodge offered to argue the case , backed up by evidence , before any international tribunal ; the Soviets coldly turned the offer down . And there the matter lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no publicity such as attended the case and trial of Francis Gary Powers -a well-paid civilian who admittedly flew his U-2 over Russia on a photomapping expedition for the Central Intelligence Agency . The men of the RB-47 were uniformed members of the Air Force , on regular duty and a legal mission . <P> Yet , since Lodge 's strong statement in the U.N. , the State Department has done nothing more than register regular fortnightly requests-which the Soviets as regularly ignore-for permission to interview the imprisoned men . The department has skipped from one excuse to another to explain its inaction : first it was the embarrassment of the Powers case , then it was the election . Recently , the lame explanation has been offered that nothing must be done until the new Administration takes office . When the Russians offered to return the airmen as a " gift " to the Kennedy Administration , the State Department had no comment-not even insisting again that the men are illegally held and the victims of Soviet piracy . <P> The wives and widows of the men of the RB-47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait . But waiting is difficult for young wives , and they can find small comfort in the driblets of letters that manage to seep through the Communist censorship . Among the personal messages the prisoners were permitted to write to their families , a few notes gave an inkling , especially as the Christmas season approached , of their solitary anguish . " I ca n't believe that nothing is happening , " wrote Bruce Olmstead , " and I do my best to make it from one day to the next , hoping that some decision will present itself . " Said John McKone : " This is an ordeal . I do n't think that either one of us will ever be the same ... I have no idea what the future holds for us at this time . "
