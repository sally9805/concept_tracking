Back in the days when Grandpa went to grade school , geography teachers had no trouble explaining how the earth 's mountains are formed . The earth is cooling and shrinking , they told the kids ; its crust has wrinkled into mountain ranges like the skin of a drying apple . Modern geophysicists , who believe that the earth was cold when it started its career , have abandoned this charmingly simple theory . Trouble is , they have had little luck developing a satisfactory substitute . <P> Now , Physicist Raymond A. Lyttleton of Cambridge University proposes a return to the wrinkle theory of mountain building-but with a difference . The earth was cool and solid when it was formed , says Lyttleton ; then radioactivity gradually heated its rocky material . A few billion years ago , the earth 's central core got hot enough to change from a plastic solid to a true liquid . Under the enormous pressure that exists near the center of the earth , liquid rock is more compressible than solid rock . So when the core liquefied , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the layers about it to settle down too . <P> <P> Most of the earth 's material is plastic enough to contract evenly , but the thin surface crust is rigid . Instead of contracting smoothly when the core shrank , it cracked and wrinkled , just as in the old theory . Sometimes parts of the earth 's crust slid over other parts like sheets of ice in a fast-flowing river . These surface irregularities , much changed by erosion , are the earth 's mountains . <P> <P> Lyttleton figures that the earth 's compressible liquid core , which can be studied by means of earthquake waves , has caused the earth to shrink about 400 miles in diameter . Some 20 million square miles of crust have been tucked away in mountainous folds and wrinkles . How long this process will continue , Lyttleton does not know . But mountains are still rising , and Lyttleton estimates that if the entire earth were to liquefy , it would lose another 50 miles of diameter . <P> <P> The moon and Mars , Lyttleton calculates , are too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of them has mountain ranges . But Venus is about the same size as the earth , is probably made of much the same material , and it may have a shrinking liquid core . As man 's space probes continue to study the distant planet , they may discover that it has a pattern of wrinkled , earth-type mountains hidden under its cloud deck .
