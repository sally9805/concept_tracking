At a stag luncheon in a Brooklyn restaurant last week , Abraham M. Lindenbaum , a member of the New York City Planning Commission , rose up over the coffee cups and asked the 43 guests how much they were prepared to contribute to Mayor Robert Wagner 's campaign for reelection . Each guest stood up in turn and announced his pledge . In the end , the mayor 's campaign purse was some $25,000 heavier . Not one of the guests-all builders and real estate men , many of whom do business with the city-failed to pledge at least $100 , and some offered as much as $5,000 . Bob Wagner smiled benignly . <P> Wagner 's two opponents in the mayorality race reacted furiously . In telegrams to the city 's Board of Ethics , Republican Louis J. Lefkowitz suggested that the pledges might have violated the city charter , which forbids city employees from accepting gifts " from any person , firm or corporation which , to his knowledge , is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent , was less delicate . " The mayor has set one of the worst examples in municipal history , " he said . " He should resign . "
