THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BERTRAND RUSSELL . 356 pages . Atlantic-Little , Brown . $7.95 . <P> <P> As a young scholar just out of Cambridge at the turn of the century , Bertrand Russell confronted a baffling conundrum . On one side of a piece of paper was written : " The statement on the other side of this paper is false . " On the other side it read : " The statement on the other side of this paper is false . " <P> The 3rd Earl Russell , now 94 , presents a psychological conundrum of a similar order . Renowned mathematician , logician , philosopher and Nobel prizewinner , he writes English with all the precision and lucidity of which the language is capable . Yet for all its clarity and wit , the first volume , instantly acclaimed in England as a classic , leaves unresolved problems of character . To some , he is a crypto-mystic , to others , a heartless brain . Most recently he has become an excessively emotional organizer of peace marches who mouths anti-American propaganda drivel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autobiography disputes what is on the other side . He combined a rigorous skeptical rationalism with a naturally religious temperament . He was a rich aristocrat in the days when a peer was a peer , but became an " international socialist " and pacifist-exhibiting the gift of naivete that he possesses in such abundance today . Earlier , having become a teetotaler to please his wife , he had taken up drinking again because " the King took the pledge during the First War . His motive was to facilitate the killing of Germans , and it therefore seemed as if there must be some connection between pacifism and alcohol . " <P> Trying to resolve the contradiction of his heart and mind , Russell has found words of some nobility : " Three passions have governed my life : the longing for love , the search for knowledge , and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind . These passions , like great winds , have blown me in a wayward course , over a deep ocean of anguish , reaching to the very verge of despair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , but what things ? Grandfather Lord John Russell had been Prime Minister , and his mother was a Stanley-one of a rich and titled tribe that took a hand more than once in governing England . His father , Lord Amberley , was a freethinker ; his mother an even freer one . They died in Bertie 's infancy , leaving him to be brought up by two atheist tutors . Mother had been sleeping with one of them , but on the highest principles : poor fellow was a tubercular , and it was then thought that he should have no children ; still , Lady Amberley felt that he should not have to do without sex merely because of this . <P> The Russells and Stanleys snatched <P> Bertie from the godless guardians and placed him in care of his grandmother , Lady Russell , who had been a lady in waiting to Queen Victoria and was a Scotch Presbyterian of dour principles . Bertie was judged too sickly for school ( actually he was strong as a horse ) and was sketchily educated at home by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of knowing until much later that he was one of the cleverest little boys who ever lived .
