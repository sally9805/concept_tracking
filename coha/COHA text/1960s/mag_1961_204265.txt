By recent standards , the new Broadway season is an unusually good one . What is not unusual is that , with rare exceptions like How to Succeed 's Bobby Morse ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) , the actors who are drawing the best notices are British . The top three : Paul Scofield , Donald Pleasence and Douglas Campbell . <P> &gt;Weary Magnificence . Scofield , 39 , is Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt 's A Man for All Seasons , a superb testimonial to the seldom-realized potential of the individual conscience . With a kind of weary magnificence , Scofield sinks himself in the part , studiously underplays it , and somehow displays the inner mind of a man destined for sainthood . Not content just to applaud , much of the audience stands and noisily shouts its appreciation for his movingly perfect performance . Appearing in the U.S. for the first time , Scofield was preceded by a reputation hard to live up to . From Kenneth Tynan to Richard Burton , British critics and actors place him among the contemporary greats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen A Man for All Seasons will quibble for a moment . The son of a schoolmaster , Scofield learned his actor 's trade as a member of the Birmingham Repertory , played Shakespeare at Stratford on Avon and a brilliant roster of contemporary roles on the London stage . In one of his rare appearances outside the United Kingdom , he was mobbed six years ago by Moscow fans who admired his Hamlet . He has a wild shock of dark , grey-flecked hair and a face that seems to rearrange itself for every role he plays . Tall , diffident and no egoist , he is as disciplined as he is dedicated . Most extraordinary aspect of his genius is , in the words of Critic Tynan , " his power to enlarge a role until it fits him , as a hatter will stretch a bowler . " <P> &gt;Marvelous &; Grimy . As the verminous tramp in Harold Pinter 's The Caretaker ( TIME , Oct. 13 ) , Donald Pleasence , 41 , succeeds in creating probably the grubbiest creature who has ever been seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like the twin of Mr. Clean . For all the brilliance of the playwright , The Caretaker would collapse onstage without an actor who could make the old man both repulsive and sympathetic . Like Scofield , Pleasence got his early experience in Birmingham . Enormously popular on British television , he has wide and proven capabilities as a character actor and in leading roles in the West End . His working range runs from comedy through the sinister to the malevolent . Son of a railroad stationmaster , Pleasence is a retiring and almost anonymous man away from work , with a subdued passion for birds , flowers and motorcars ( he drives a Jaguar ) . One curious result of his marvelously grimy performance in Caretaker is that he feels compelled to reassure people that " I do bathe-often . I had a bath a few minutes ago . "
