Vice-presidential candidates generally get excellent training to serve as No. 2 men . They spend much of their campaigns in the boondocks , are subject to unnerving changes of schedule , and go largely unnoticed . This year , however , the veep candidates are attracting more attention than usual , one because he is proving a more promising prospect than most people suspected , the other because of his monumental boo-boos . <P> <P> Jogginq Institutions . The sleeper is Maine 's Senator Edmund Muskie. * In the western Pennsylvania city of Washington last week , Muskie gave an impressive display of coolness . For three minutes , he stood silently at the microphone in front of the county courthouse as some 40 students from Washington and Jefferson College yelled : " Stop the war ! Stop the war ! " When one screamed " Say something ! " Muskie allowed : " Well , that 's not a bad idea . If you will give me the chance , I will try . " A student replied : " You have a chance ! We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then inspiration struck . " I 'll tell you what , " he said . " I 'll make you a bargain . " He invited Rick Brody , 21 , a sandaled , longhaired senior wearing a peace medallion , to speak for ten minutes . <P> Brody was rambling and emotional . <P> <P> " Everybody calls us dirty and unwashed , " he said . " We are the true Americans . We want America to stand for what the Constitution stands for , which is everyone equal under the law . " He advised the crowd : " Sit out this election . " As if anticipating what Muskie would say , he declared : " You are going to hear a lot of stuff , a lot of platitudes , about apple pie and motherhood . That 's fine . But does it bring any sort of qualitative change ? No ! " Yet later , as Muskie praised American youth for " jogging our institutions , " Brody nodded up at him and said to a bystander : " If they would do this more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests . " <P> In Detroit later in the week , Muskie followed up by urging tolerance of the disaffected pro-McCarthy young before a United Auto Workers conference . <P> " They 've met what they considered defeat , " said Muskie , " and they 're on the threshold of disillusionment . The worst thing we can do is throw cold water on their expectations . " <P> Apologize Now . The stumbler in the campaign is the G.O.P. vice-presidential candidate , Maryland 's Governor Spiro Agnew . He has committed so many errors , in fact , that a picket greeted him in Washington last week with a placard reading : APOLOGIZE NOW , SPIRO . IT WILL SAVE TIME LATER . <P> <P> Agnew began the campaign by calling Hubert Humphrey " squishy soft " on Communism , a charge he hastily retracted . Two weeks ago , he denounced a charge of " collusion " with George Wallace , only to discover that the charge had been made against the Democrats by Dick Nixon . In Casper , Wyo. , Agnew put a Stetson on backward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On KULR-TV in Billings , Mont. , he hinted that the Republicans had a solution to the war , forcing Nixon into a weary " what-Mr. -Agnew-meant-to-say " denial .
