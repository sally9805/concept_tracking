Wyoming 's conservative Democratic Governor Jack Robert Gage , 63 , is a gnarled , homespun sort who has prospered by doing what most politicians do n't . In 1959 , as secretary of state , he asked the Wyoming legislature to cut his department 's budget ; it did , but even so , Gage did not spend all the money . Succeeding to the governorship last year to fill out an unexpired term , Gage confounded Wyoming boosters who were fond of claiming dramatic population growth for the state . Said he : " This is just not true , since among the continental states we happen to rank next to the bottom . In my thoughts alone , this is somewhat of a blessing . " <P> Last week , in the published announcement that he would run this year to retain his office . Gage made no claim that he was bowing to popular demand . Said he of the practice so often used by other politicians : " One way or another they say in substance , I really do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends have begged and pleaded that I have finally given way to their pressure . ' " Concluded Gage : " I do not feel that I am anyone 's glowing gift to Wyoming-in fact , Wyoming has done much more for me than I can hope to do in return . I do not think I have all the answers ; nor have I heard all the questions . At the same time , I know that I have my teeth into this job . I know what it takes . I like it , and announce the fact that I will run because I want to very much . "
