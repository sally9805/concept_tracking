For Italian Composer Luigi Dallapiccola , 57 , life has by his own testimony been " one long suffer . " The suffer is apparent in the spare , abrasively powerful twelve-tone music that has flowed steadily from his pen through years of poverty , persecution and neglect . But Dallapiccola is neglected no longer : even his severest critics in Italy acknowledge his influence as the patriarch of the Italian twelve-tone school . Manhattan audiences last week had a first chance to hear one of the patriarch 's finest works - the 13-minute Variations for Orchestra as performed by the visiting Boston Symphony under Guest Conductor Erich Leinsdorf . <P> Although Dodecaphonist Dallapiccola believes that his spiritual brother is James Joyce ( he has read Ulysses eight times ) , Variations sounds more like a page out of Kafka . It opens with a funereal , ghostlike theme in the strings , erupts in a chilling shower of brasses , sinks to a series of restless , enervated whispers . Percussive and rhythmically complex throughout , it is scored sparely , skillfully using small instrumental combinations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from much of the desiccated twelve-tone music of the Viennese school is its sense of passion : Dallapiccola , however his music may suffer , always seems to care . <P> Night Flights . The composer was introduced to the twelve-tone idiom in 1924 at the Florence premiere of Schoenberg 's Pierrot Lunaire . " Only two people in the hall were impressed by the music , " he recalls . " One was a very unimportant young man . Me . The other was Giacomo Puccini . " Dallapiccola , who for a time composed in a largely traditional , tonal style ( he has always been an ardent Wagner fan ) , gradually started learning twelve-tone technique , teaching himself by studying Schoenberg 's scores . " But in those days nobody appreciated my music , " and he and his wife were sometimes reduced to a diet of water and one roll a day . <P> Teaching helped keep Dallapiccola going , but his name began to be heard after the 1940 premiere of his first opera , Night Flight , based on the book by Antoine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding in the mountains to protect his Jewish wife from the German forces in Italy . Since the war , his reputation has steadily grown as he has added to his small body of work a number of impressive vocal compositions : Five Fragments from Sappho for Voice and Chamber Orchestra , Five Songs for Baritone , Two Anacreon Songs and Requiescat ( set to words by St. Matthew , Oscar Wilde and James Joyce )
