txt " Egypt can easily survive the coming year without economic collapse even if it keeps the Suez Canal closed . " In making this assessment , Middle East economic analysts add that any big new Mideast war would place it in serious doubt . Egypt 's present foreign debt burden is staggering  --  perhaps $4 billion to $5 billion if Soviet replacements of equipment lost in the June war are not gifts . Bulthere are some lesser known , brighter aspects . First of all Egypt 's modest but fast-growing oil production has climbed back to the level it had reached before Israel seized Ras Sudr and other Sinai Peninsula oil fields in June . Egypt 's production may exceed 5 million tons by the end of 1967 , industrial sources say . The loss of Sinai fields now operated by Israel is offset by expanding production in the Morgan offshore concession in the Gulf of Suez and in the Western Desert near El Alamein . Panamerican Oil Company , an affiliate of Standard Oil of Indiana , is working with Egypt 's governmental General Petroleum Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Egypt in June , have mostly returned to work . Domestically refined petroleum products will probably be sufficient this year without spending scarce foreign currency for imports . Cotton production improves Last year boll weevils gnawed their way through a considerable percentage of the cotton crop . Bad weather further reduced the yield . New aerial spraying techniques , a new weevil resistant strain of cotton , and better weather ? have somewhat improved the 1967 yields . It has all been . sold , mainly to East bloc countries as usual . Loss of nearly $300 million in annual Suez Canal revenues through the canal 's closing is nearly or totally offset by a subsidy of about $280 million from the rich Arab oil states , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and Libya . The first quarterly payment of the subsidy , decided on by the fourth Arab summit conference in Khartoum Sept. 1 , is being made this month . " The Arab subsidy has one big advantage over the canal tolls , " said one Egyptian economic planner . " It comes in regular installments , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily . " The Communist bloc , France , and some other countries already have supplied all of Egypt 's breadgrain requirements for the winter . Before 1966 , these had been met largely from massive easy-term American food sales , stopped a year ago . Basic foods and even some luxury goods are in better supply , say Egyptian householders , than before the war . Though real wages have been cut by taxes and compulsory savings and war loans , prices of some essentials such as bread and rice have been reduced by subsidies . Work abroad encouraged This week the - government nationalized some wholesale food trade to cut black marketeering and hoarding . Good news for Egyptians who want to emigrate to work abroad was a government order this week creating offices to facilitate this . This is the first such encouragement since the revolution of 1952 . Travel abroad has been severely curbed . Egypt 's present population of 31 Million is expected to pass to 35 million by 1970 . Large-scale family planning experiments are under way , but consumption continues to gain over production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various Arab countries such as Libya , Iraq , and Morocco . Lesser skilled workers have so far gone only to Kuwait , which has an agreement with Egypt on labor . Soviet aid to Egyptian development projects continues . The Aswan High Dam 's construction is being finished on time . A new power turbine and high tension lines will soon connect the Upper Nile Valley 's power grid with earlier power projects in the Cairo and Delta areas built with American aid . One of the toughest immediate problems is.resettling an anticipated 200,000 refugees and evacuees from towns along the Suez Canal , exposed to fighting with the Israelis on the opposite bank . Most " nonessential " civilians from Is-* // * Egyptian economy buffeted // mailia , Suez , and Port Tawfik are to be settled in the southern province of Beni Suef and other underpopulated provinces . This may cost the government as much as $8 million though not in hard currency . Tourism suffers Tourism is another bleak sector . The June war stopped it and forced the government to reconsider its planned allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 . Even before the June war , tourism had fallen below the 1965 figures . Though package tours from Europe have not revived , individual tourists are coming back in growing numbers especially from France , West Germany , and Scandinavia and East bloc countries . The State Department at this writing still prohibits American tourists from visiting Egypt and Syria . Egyptian travel agents and hotel owners say they are longing for their return . Cairo 's luxury hotels are operating again . But hundreds of smaller hotels throughout Egypt remain closed or in some cases requisitioned by the government . Servicing Egypt 's gigantic debt is an immense problem . Repayment at 2.5 percent interest on a $100 million Soviet loan for the first stage of the Aswan High Dam began in 1964 and is supposed to be spread over 12 annual installments . Repayment is supposed to begin in 1970 of another $225 million Soviet loan for Aswan . Economists estimate that about 60 percent of the Soviet aid allocated by former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev has been spent with repayments scheduled through the 1980 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Soviet arms lost and partially replaced since the June war are not known . These deliveries are thought partially to account for a recent drastic rise in the new Soviet defense budget . Back United States loans , other East bloc loans , and international loans probably total another $2 billion . Repayments on most American loans are supposed to be spaced over 10 to 40 years . Italy , West Germany , and France have granted Egypt some debt relief since the beginning of 1966.
