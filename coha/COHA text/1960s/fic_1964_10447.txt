better than the next person . What she understood was how her loins had condemned two men , and she came home to get Deirdre 's virginal approval for that . Not that they would in any circumstances have spoken of it this way . The female principle in them was as mute as it was deaf to ordinary speech . Yet Deirdre in her strength would have found ways to applaud the achievement of widowhood , since she , too , had believed with the ponderous inertia of the heart in the marriage between her niece and Royce . Carole came home for that , and found instead that the first bedsoreswere beginning to harass Deirdre like a flock of jackals attackinga lion 's victim while it still lives . For Carole there was something more ominous about the earliest peppering of sores on the skin than in the cancer performing its secret ministry unseen . Worse , Deirdre 's vote against Royce repudiated a tacit understandingbetween young and old woman which had underwritten the nine years of anomalous relation with him  --  as if a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them had it out right after the election , " You blame me for second thoughts , and perhaps it would have been easier to go on just a little longer spoiling him . You blame me , though he treated you like a plaything . " The bitter accents from her aunt were the worst betrayal Carole had known in her life , and her aunt 's word stuck in her ear like a bean . How much easier if Deirdre had said " whore "  --  since that would have been a scarecrow word , borrowed uneasily to serve the occasion of anger . But plaything  --  thecontempt and despair therein came from the roots of Deirdre 's life ; she saw everything staked on seriousness and work . How much better to have been caught years ago playing under Royce and whipped for it or shamed and locked up than to be told so late how much tolerance she had wasted . " If I was a fool that 's not altogether Royce 's fault , " she said , but she knew that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life  --  because the rules were changed on her while she remained faithful . In those things that counted most for her she had been most a fool . The bedsores , when they began to spread like flowers in a benignp101season during the last months of Deirdre 's illness , seemed purposely to remind her she had counted on the old woman 's living forever . They were Carole 's obsession  --  hers . For the doctors the masculine work of doing what they could to slow the cancer and block the big complexes of nerves ; for her the incessant , breath-holding opposition to the sores . Even when Deirdre was in the hospital , which , after October , was most of the time until she died , and when there were nurses to change the pads and unguents and to roll the finally powerlessbody , the clusters and banks of sores were Carole 's garden . They were hers to dream about and wake from each morning in a terror of anxiety . They were for her to tend like some little girl in a nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abominations grew in your garden while you slept ? In a kind of enchantment she peered over the nurses ' shoulders when , in the hospital period , they lifted the dressings to disclose whether the garden thrived or withered . And tending the sores seemed to repeat some obligation her aunt had laid on her long ago , warning her in a warm strong voice that if she were negligent the crimson-headed , violet , and gold of the garden would suffer instead of her for her fault . There were some victories against the sores , at least in the summer months when Deirdre could get about , first on her feet and then in a wheel chair . Meticulous cooperation between the women , some unspoken harmony of will , restored patches of baby pink and delicateskin where a sore had been conquered . Carole would believe that because one area had healed , her aunt was getting better . The cancer did n't seem to matter . But then elsewhere , though usually at least tangential to the healed area , a dark spot would appear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shadow that might be either below or above the skin . Then it looked like a bruise under the skin . Then it was brighter and blossomed , like something bursting through into Carole 's consciousness , turning toward the terrible sun of her guilt . It helped , of course , that the old woman matched every inroad of her disease with some lie about the life that had brought her to it and had finally pinned her flat in the packing-house stench of her own meat . She forgot that she had voted against Royce for the samep102reason she denied her bad nights when Carole came to her at dawn . So she forgot that she had ever had any reasons for voting against him . The past was idealized because the present absolutely had to be . On the night of Mooney 's reception , when they met the Morgans on the walk , Deirdre had been as high on her lies and morphine as any Bronkley drunkard on cheap gin . She had not so much been reconciled to Royce . She had just failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of her with his legal wife beside him . Later , in her pitifully brief intervals of lucidity , she stopped admittingthat Royce Morgan had ever grown past the age of twelve . She liked Carole to bring old snapshots to the hospital , and one of her few regrets as they talked about twenty years ago was that there were n't more photographs including " Dr. Morgan 's boy . " " He was like a king , " she said tearfully one day . " Who ? " Carole asked , thinking it possible Deirdre meant old Dr. Morgan . " Why , Royce , " Deirdre said , as if surprised that anyone could wonder . " He was only a child . " " A child , yes . You know the old times were not good , either for men or women . And confusion . If we wanted something , we were too old to enjoy it when we got it . But there had to be a time . " She stopped as if she had perfectly and lucidly completed her thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where . " " Where ? " " All right . " " I 'm sorry , " Carole said . " I understand , darling . I understand . You gave me such a good childhood . " " Where , " her aunt nodded affirmatively . " He was a king . " Tears rolled down the bony gullies of her skull . " The old times were not good , " she said  --  meaning surely the times before the old times where her hope was absurdly anchored still . And Carole , leaving the hospital that day , clung to the ornamental limestone risers beside the door , supporting herself a little while asp103she tried to focus on the pigeons flying over the brightness of snow . Through clenched teeth she said , " This is n't good for me . You ought to know it is n't good for me . " Cancer may or may not be a communicable disease , but the confusion of dying is . Charitable onlookers said that in nursing Deirdre as she did , Carole was displaying the well-rooted toughness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mercy had to ignore , how she began to drink desperately and more heavily than ever to pass the nights of waiting . And that  --  as it never is  --  was not the worst . The old woman 's death forced her to think again of many things she had let drift almost out of her memory . From their panicked reassessments ruined women catch the inspiration to commit their worst follies all over again . In the years since Royce told her he was on his way  --  onward and upward  --  she had formed a tissue of acceptances and healthy commonplacesto cover the wound . She had lived a life at least superficiallynormal . Early in the war she had gone cheerily into the WAFs because she liked airplanes and felt better to be helping out . She had liked people . She had been " in love " each time she married . That had seemed only right to her  --  just as it went on seeming only right to her that Royce had broken away if he " had made a mistake . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea that she was , after all , a " born farmer , " born , alas , a little out of place , was stubbornly set in her , set to grow and flourish for the rest of her life . ) She believed conventionally enough in love as an exchange betweenparties , an evenly shared possession that grows with mutual respect as two loving people get to know each other better  --  from which it would follow logically that Royce and she had not truly loved each other , that she had not known love as nature intended her to know it . Therein logic erred badly  --  though it gave her a formula to repeat to herself as often as she needed it . It erred , for love in her , in her big juicy body and in her emotional needs that were out of all pro/portion to her reasoning control of them , was simply a tyranny , with herself as its single subject . She loved . There was no doubt of that any more than there is that a steam boiler puffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to be part of a reciprocating mechanism turned out to be a nearly deadly assumption . In fact it had been deadly for a couple of husbands who were rash enough to guess that huffing and puffing of love was for them  --  that when the dragon came out of the cave it would want to be petted . They were shown better . Of course she had enough common sense to know she was not literally their murderer . Their deaths were accident and the chances of war . Still she felt that trying to focus this awful love of hers on them was a process that might have killed them before her eyes . They might have died in the conjugal bedroom if the process had gone on long enough . She knew that after each of them died , love and the need to love had gone on unabated in her ( just as it had after she sensibly slaughtered her expectations of Royce Morgan ) . So it must have been a very bad error to suppose these things were created by anyone outside herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge that loved ones have no more responsibility for the growth of love than a sucking baby has for the production of milk in the breast . Her breasts were pained with love after Deirdre 's death , and there was no one suitable to be in love with . The very impulse to fall in love with another man frightened her  --  seeing what that had come to before . Besides , if she were going to fall in love with a man again it would probably be Royce , and though her life was ruined in all its larger promises , the ruins still had a pattern that steered her away from him . She was loyal  --  therefore must not love as far as he was concerned . The right man might yet come . There was a good deal still to attract enough men to give her a sporting choice . She was just a little past thirty . She was not exactly pretty , but she might seem somethingmuch better than that to men with a taste for big women . From Deirdre she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash . It would take a very cunning man to guess the state her demoralization had reached , for she had learned it was a duty to keep grinning , and the shell of dutiful observations was intact , still quite intact . She was thought to be taking her trials gamely . Besides , just as some men might especially like a big , plump girl , some might like her kind of demoralization . So there was time . So there was hope . If life had never been built on its own ruins before , it would long since have disappeared . In the meantime , since she could n't help loving , she fell in love with the Morgan family as a unit . It was stacked cruelly in the cards that she should love Priss . Fundamentally the choice was to love or to hate , as it always is between one lover and her successor if they are in contact at all . Especially after three deaths , Carole lacked the conscience to hate anyone . Ergo .. . Royce had chosen Priss over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference to his judgment encouraged her to love . Priss had asked her " home " from Deirdre 's grave . Therefore she must have penetrated deep into the secret of Carole 's homelessness . Further , Priss loved her  --  which says nothing of the quality , constancy , or commitment of that love , but only that it was there to be sensed . Carole 's capacity for wholesome wonder and respect flattered Priss as hardly anything else in Buchanan could , and Carole was valued according to that measure . The two women were a good deal together in that spring after Carole was freed of Deirdre . Carole was given a large history of Priscilla London Morgan . Carole said , " Ohl " to most of what she heard . " Ohl " Anyone who could be moved , as she was , to wonder and respect by the decorative " themes " of the Country Club dances was ordained to gape like a fat elder sister at Priss 's recollected triumphs in art . From Deirdre , out of Harvey Pelham Morgan , Carole had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out of yourself , " she said . Anyone who knew how to enthuse as she could over the renditions ofp106Brahms and Saint-Saens by the Wellford Pro Arte Orchestra was meant to burn pure white when she was told about Priss 's days with Martha Graham , or the times Priss had studied painting with Beckmanand Ernst , or played with a jazz group admired in Greenwich Village circa 1936 . " Oh ! " Carole said to all these glamorous accomplishments . Only why had Priss ever given them up ? " You ought to at least play your fiddle for Lot , " she would urge , blushing . " I 'd love to hear you play . I never could play anything except the triangle . " " Triangle ? " Priss , for such questions , had a tone of condescension so sugared that it passed for a flattering reply to flatteries . " A triangle is a piece of steel that goes booiing when you hit it . They let me carry one in the North High Marching Band , " Carole remembered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been humiliating . But Deirdre always told me it was something . She used to say , At least it 's something ! ' " " Someday you get your triangle and I 'll get my fiddle and we 'll go through the streets , " Priss said . They would never do anything so showy in Buchanan , of course . But since Carole needed occupation ( Priss 's rationalization ) and Carole had to be kept handy on a tether ( Priss 's obsession ) , they must immediately start on something . So they went into ceramics " seriously . " Mooney had repeated his appeals to use the studio and Priss 's services . She thought : Would n't he sniff a little harder  --  and catch a more important scent  --  if she and Carole could soon tease him with a hit of commercial and artistic success ? When her father came to Buchanan for a spring visit , she enlisted him to get the project rolling . Father London did n't give a damn for " jugs , " as he called them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a new start on anything . He used to hope she would find herself each time she started something new . Now he only hoped she would hold onto herself , at least long enough to give Lot a straight start in his life , for he was crazy about the little boy . This may have been one of the reasons he so quickly asked Carolep107to marry him . His acquisitive eye saw not only a rich widow ( he was not likely to undervalue the happiness of marrying for money ; that wise stroke had made his life ) but saw the flickering promise of something splendid developing between her and the child . He liked to watch Carole , in taut slacks and loose violet sweater , trundling Lot around the Morgans ' yard on Royce 's old bicycle , leaf-shattered sunlight falling on them like a shower of mythic gold . He sat there enjoying the wobble of Carole 's ass , savoring the supramotherlyway she indulged and checked the brash , bright kid . It would have been disloyal of him to think that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his daughter that she ought to have been Royce 's wife instead of Priss . But the judgment was too definite to throw away altogether , so he compromised it foggily by daydreaming that he could provide the boy a sweet grandmother and himself a dandy , comfortable lay by the same maneuver . Shyly , with a take-it-or-leave-it gruffness , he offered his daydream to Carole  --  and was jolted rather stiffly to find that her response was neither a happy affirmative , nor amusement , nor astonishment , but fright . He had never frightened anyone in his whole life before , and it shook him up . To make things worse , Priss heard of the proposal  --  from Carole , who timidly wondered if the old man had been joking or what  --  and vilified him for it . " Daddy , if that woman falls into bed with any more of the men in my life I 'm going to have myself sewed up and go to a nunnery . " " You mean Royce . . . ? " " Well , not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I do n't mean Lot , either , though there 's something kind of sloppy in the way those two carry on . " " Something very nice . " " Very nice then , " Priss said with a skewering smile . " I mean Royce lost his virginity , or whatever boys have , to that one and I 'm learningbelatedly to my surprise that it makes some kind of metaphysical difference . " " But I thought , " her father said slowly , " that you liked Carole . " His painter 's eye had liked the look of this Midwestern householdp108and preferred to take it simply , at the value of its handsome surface , a value somewhat enhanced by the presence of Carole as friend , with no ambiguities dangling from that word . He should have known that where his daughter was involved there would be a labyrinth under the paintable surface and that Priss lived her true life down in the labyrinth with intrigues always in progress . " I like Carole fine , " Priss raged . " Just where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're trying to manipulate her , " he said in bewildered despair of guessing either how or why , only sure that he wished she would not . " How can I ? " Priss said , holding up her hands in a fury of innocence . " I ca n't make her do anything she does n't want to , can I ? Tell me how I 'm manipulating her . You ca n't . Furthermore it was boorish of you to joke about marrying her when she 's really , really , really sick in the gut from everyone dying on her . She 's not quite so sunny as she acts around strangers . " " I may be a stranger , but I was n't joking , " Father London said . Nevertheless  --  helpless as a muscle man against a tiny judo expert  --  he let go his loverly daydreams and lapsed into being Grandpa , who helped the girls with their ceramic project . He did n't like jugs . He only liked cubist paintings and high living . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an efficient organizer and executor . So , happily , was Carole . Sneering at amateurism , Priss wanted to bring out a line of tableware  --  " not just vases , for heaven 's sake "  --  that could be put into quantity production if her experiments went well . She brooded over her conceptions and designs , sending Grandpa and Carole off again and again to Chicago . They were to find someone who would build a kiln " more professional than these little plug-in jobbies . " The old man knew people at the Art Institute and the Institute of Design . Carole knew  --  or rather her banker and lawyer knew  --  engineers and contractors who ordinarily would not spare the time to advise a couple of women starting their own shop . Priss refined her templates and molds , a handsome young witchp109incanting over her retorts . The other two ordered equipment , directedcarpenters , electricians , and the mason who built their kilns , and for a while the Morgan stable hummed like a war emergency . This went on with the lively accompaniment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn toward the designing end of the project . " That 's the reason for the whole thing , " Priss explained earnestly to Royce . " Heavens , not just to turn her into a businesswomanor give her some way to spend her money . " Carole was financing the kilns and remodeling , and insisting on it with an unhealthy fervor , as if paying off a psychic debt . " I 'm trying to find something creative for her . Why must you always try to choke the creative ? " " Is that what I 've done with you ? " he asked with grief . " Who 's talking about me ? I 'm happier than I 've been for years . Ca n't you tell that something 's going for me ? Ca n't you tell , sweetie ? I 'll show you , " she said with fevered affection . " I meant for Carole . Do n't you think you came near enough to spoiling her life so we owe her a way out now ? " " If we had it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have I done wrong ? " " Nothing . " " Then why do you wag your head as if I had ? What do you want me to do ? Call the whole thing off ? " " I want you to go ahead . " " Try to sound like it then . " " Yes . " Her brows lifted maliciously . " Is it that you want to screw her again and I 'm getting in your way by being her friend ? " Here was an invitation to fight back , at least to counter with an equally massive denial . But he said , " I 'm not very good at handling these extreme terms . Ca n't it be the truth that I have some lingering ambivalences about Carole  --  guilts , if you like that word ; frustrations , if you like that  --  without finding them so overpowering I have to believe them the full truth of my life ? " " Oh , I always know what you 're going to say by now , " she criedp110impatiently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who cares ? Daddy 's trying . Help yourself . Did you know Daddy asked her to marry him ? " Royce knew that Priss had not often called her male parent " Daddy " since puberty , and when she did there was emotional broken glass scattered somewhere nearby that the barefoot would do well to watch out for . " It does n't surprise me greatly , " he said . He felt a swift onset of fatigue , like a chill , as if more than he already knew -- more than the secret fates had yet unwound  --  was anticipated by this roundabout pattern of quarreling . Without knowing exactly why , he felt great pity for his father-in-law , as for a man looking at green meadows from a prison window . " Oh , nothing would surprise you , " Priss said . Then , her blackmailcollected , she softened . " Really , my love , recovery is setting in . We 're making our readjustment to civilian life and all that sort of crap . Carole does have talent . You must see some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She has a talented teacher , " Royce said , staring at the years to come . " Promise me , honey , one thing . Be careful of her . " " I intend to , honey , " Priss answered offhandedly . Royce saw a few pieces of pottery that Carole ran up in the studio under Priss 's talented guidance . They showed exactly why Carole had played the triangle  --  only the triangle  --  in the marching band . A determined child with ten thumbs could have done as well . As a matter of fact , Lot was learning to throw a pot far more quickly than partner Carole . Some evenings Grandpa London , Lot , Carole , and Priss all deserted Royce to work in the unfinished studio . The old man did fine things and was bored with them . Priss restricted herself to finicking with designs that might be popular . Lot was the natural star of these evenings , and Carole was delighted that it should be so . One evening she came in with the boy to Royce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pride.  | " What you got ? " Royce asked , shoving books and papers aside on his desk and taking in his big hands the clay thing the boy had brought to show him . Carole could not contain herself . " It 's an urn ! He did n't have any template or even pictures to go by , but he 'd seen it in a book . It 's an urn ! " Lot cocked a scornful eyebrow at this gushing flood of maternal emotion roaring over his head . " A Grecian urn , " he said . Turning it in the lamplight , Royce saw it was , well . . . well , hardly that . The sticky thing had lumps and bulges , and anyone but a mother should have seen that if Lot had n't used a template , perhaps he should have . The design was scratched crudely . After all , a five-year-old had done it . And yet , yet the spirit was not invisible . It spoke through the clay . Whether or not the palpable design contributed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there woke some ideal possibility and just for a moment tugged away the veils of event and circumstance , Royce felt a queer catching of his throat , a second of ecstasy as if he were in the presence of something realer than his life . He held the damp thing like a globe on his fingertips , breathed hard , and said , " With brede of marble men and maidens overwrought . ' It 's wonderful , Lot . Wonderful , wonderful , wonderful . " " Gim me , gim me , gim me , " Lot said , dancing with the praise he could not quite accommodate . " Mommy 's gon na fire it tonight and I can take it to kindergarten if it does n't crack . " " Maybe . . . maybe , maybe you should n't try to fire it , " Carole said . She knew what could happen to clay from which not all the air bubbles or impurities have been cut . She knew that Lot was very often too impatient to prepare his clay well before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was too thrilled with the beauty he had made , the headiness of triumphing like this in his father 's eyes ( to say nothing of the eyes of his kindergarten buddies , known in anticipation ) to want to risk all that in the hot kiln . And yet .. . " It 's got to be fired , " Royce said gently  --  as if for the second timep112in Carole 's presence he were saying the most dreadful of sentences . It shook him that once again , and after all he could be said to have learned , that the decision had to be exactly the same . " It 's got ta be fired , " Lot said reproachfully to Carole . Who once again bowed her head to authority . For some reason that would never be fully understood , the overwroughtmaiden Carole remained sitting in Royce 's study when Lot went back through the house and across the young grass of the lawn to the studio . Both she and Royce bent their heads and listened ( a little breathlessly , afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urn to pieces ) until they heard the tone of voices  --  not the words  --  from the studio signifying a safe arrival . Then they still sat on with bowed heads as if listening  --  well , listening to the mysteriously renewed maples in the dark outside that whispered in some everlasting wind , hearing far off the horns of a processional , a lowing of garlanded heifers , treble song , joy itself leading them to betrayals and their present age . To loveliness betrayingthem , and yet . . . They remembered what had been good and knew no more what to do about it than they had known before . " He 's a good boy , " Royce said huskily . Then her head came back , mouth open and opening wider , and her eyes burning like damnation . He was afraid . He was afraid simply that she was going to say what she might have said one other time : No , goddamn you , no , you 're wrong . Put your cock in me and stay . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried like a medium , " He 's a king . " Her own cry seemed to wake and shame her . She knew it was Deirdre 's sick passion that she echoed here . But since her aunt had lived all her life in the disciplines of virginity and had been dying when she finally permitted herself the expression , Carole could not claim the right to speak this way . " I mean . . . he 's so nice and proud in a nice way , he makes me think of a storybook king . " Having to tone down and falsify what she really meant shamed her . " Well , we must n't let him hear that , " Royce laughed . He saw spring lightning glimmer above the dark horizon across the riverp113and waited for the sound of thunder . Before it came , he said , " Gee , I have n't kept up with what you toilers are doing out there with your mud pies . Let 's go see . " He knew Priss was timing Carole 's absence  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion  --  with a measure more sensitive than a clock . He had never had a keener sense that Priss was watching them , that now she was close to seizing what had to be kept theirs alone , kept from Priss even at the cost of denying to themselves its existence . That night when she came with Lot to his study was the highwatermark of Carole 's intimacy with the Morgan family . For a moment she and Royce had stared at a muddy urn in the boy 's hands and had intimations of the figures that belonged , by right , on its globy surface . An intimation  --  and then denial . Something happened a few days later that served  --  still cryptically , of course  --  to give them the means to dramatize the necessary cleavingof what they were forbidden to share . To initiate the dramatic sequence , Lot peed in his pants in front of his kindergarten classmates . His parents never quite got the story clear of how this " was allowed "  --  as Priss said in her outrage  --  to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It is n't a question of its being allowed to happen . It will happen to little boys . " " That satisfiesyou ? That explanation ? " " No , " Royce said , who all his life was committed to wondering what nature meant . Here again he would have to fall short of finding out . Anyway , it appeared that Lot had been reciting . He knew a Mother Goose rhyme , and since poetry is powerful stuff , it may be that the rhythms and the rhymes sounding in the ducts of his head said more to him than the silly verse could possibly say to his squattingpeers . Some men there are who can not hold their water when the bagpipe blows i ' the nose . . . . His father could guess how those queer , characteristic indentions would have appeared on his forehead like the print of invisible huge fingernails . How Lot would have still been listening to something else , some unearthly euphony , when the hot gush wet his seer/sucker shorts and the yellow , frothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed on the hardwood floor by sheer unwillingness to believe what she saw . Miss Kenneth called Priss that morning  --  to ask if Lot had come home , since , gee , he had n't returned to the classroom after she had sent him to the lavatory . Priss called her a " stupid , twenty-two-yearoldbitch unfit to be a teacher " and roared over at top speed to pick up Royce from his office . Together they cruised the green streets between their home and the school , back and forth , peering behind hedges and lilac bushes , up and down alleys . " Where 's your father this morning ? Does Lot know where . ? " " You mean he 'd look for him instead of me . . . us ? Father 's home , maybe out in the studio . And Lot 's not home . " " Let 's look there again . Maybe he 's got there by now . " But he had n't . Mr. London was just waking up , fixing his breakfastin the kitchen . When he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What . . . ? " " Nothing has happened , " Priss said with deadly anger . " We 're looking for Lot , is all , and if he is n't here . . . Come on , Royce . " " Nothing serious , " Royce said to his father-in-law . He smiled and Mr. London shook his head . " We 'll look down by the river , " Priss said , and since she was still driving the car , they went down there , careening onto a driveway fifty yards from the water 's edge , frightening a man watering his lawn . They ran along the bank of the river , through muddy swales and over stretches of damp stones . Bushes lashed their faces . Priss lost a shoe and kicked the other one off . Her gaze was turned constantly toward the brown blue drift of water past them . But overhead the branches moved in a weaving motion . The smell of mold and greenery was healing , and at last even Priss was reassured . She stopped and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come down here just for . . . some little thing . " " If he had it would only be to be alone awhile . We 'll go back to the house . He 'll show up . " But now that Priss was sure , Royce wasp115not . He felt like a man compelled to hold back all the waters of the world , the great South Pacific itself , with the flat of his hand . He felt compelled to a gesture like that a soldier would make as he died on the beach at Saipan . He said evenly , " I 'm sure he 's there by now . " Mr. London came hustling to meet them when they turned again into the driveway . " It 's all right ! It 's all right ! " he called . " Lot 's over at Carole 's . He ran away from school and went over there . You 're supposed to call . " " I will , " Royce said . The hand that had blocked the flood relaxed . " Not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she clattered her heels dramatically across the boards of the porch . The sound they made was happy and martial , anxious and glad . " But why did n't he come home ? " was the first thing she said into the phone . Carole sensitively took the question as a reprimand  --  which in all probability it was . She had gone too far , merely in being Lot 's chosen sanctuary . She had hung up his shorts to dry in the back yard . She had given him ice cream to eat in one of the cushioned wicker chairs on the sun porch . And somehow she had grossly usurped another woman 's rights , her friend 's rights . She had better stand farther away or she might do more unintentional harm . No one said that Lot 's accident was a turning point . It was unlikelythat Carole herself ever called it that . But afterward she came to their house less freely . She lost interest in the ceramics . What had not been clear became clearer  --  that she had nothing more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priss to maintain the fiction that she was still needed . Like the sores she had sometimes driven from Deirdre 's skin , the more ghastly emotional consequences of the past winter were vanishing . She began to see more of her old acquaintances . She scheduled a few dinners and cocktail parties at home , the first of them on eveningswhen at least her friend Priss would represent the Morgan family there . Sometimes Mr. London came , too , and jousted in the role of a bohemian with Buchanan business people ( who had out/pointed him two to one in fornication and other vice , who were philosophically nihilist in comparison to his old-baby optimism , whether anyone realized this or not ) . She appeared at a few college functions , and under Priss 's occult stare chatted a time or two with President Mooney . All Buchanan thought she was " coming out of it " and admired her as much for forgetting the horror of her attendance on Deirdre as for having endured it . When it was known she meant to spend the summer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her Buchanan interests and stay . A lot of people would in her place . But still , as that spring ended , she did n't seem quite " to know what to do with herself . " As a piece of obvious self-therapy she bought a surplus Piper Cub . She had flown a good deal during the war . At least it would pass the time to go on with her flying . Twice in the splendor of late May she took Lot with her on flights down the river valley and home again with a great circle up close to Chicago . Maybe she was showing the young king his kingdom  --  not an acreage so much as a season , a great green season most readily visible from a certain altitude . He came back each time like someone who has been dreaming . Strange things went on between the two of them alone up there in the yellow-winged Cub . At the end of the second flight Father London and Priss waited for them at the airport in Priss 's new convertible . The afternoon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jacket after a while and presently his red bow tie . It was as if he were stripping to prepare for frankness . All at once he said , " You accused me of joking when I asked Carole to marry me . " " Were n't you ? " she asked languidly . She was peering into the domed sky as if it were a crystal ball she held between her palms . " I do n't know , " he said with a little grunt of exasperation at himself . " Maybe I 'd just like to paint that . . . that stuff . " Priss laughed at him fondly . " God never meant you to be a cubist . Why have you tortured yourself so long ? " He did n't bother to reply that his life had been the opposite ofp117torture . That was too obvious , even to Priss , who was seldom distracted by the obvious . " Was she joking with me when she said she was going to marry this Mooney fellow ? " " What ? " Priss 's teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit you either ? " Mr. London said acidly . Priss was recovering herself . " I 'm merely bowled over . I mean , congratulations on being the first to hear ! When will the good tidings be announced to the rest of the commoners ? " Her father shook his head impatiently . He had something to tell as straightforwardly as it could be stated , and he saw no excuse for adding unnecessary misunderstandings to what was already complex enough . " The other day when we were coming home from Chicago she told me the whole story about how her aunt was involved in this fiasco of Royce 's . She told me more than that . About the way she was involved . " " Did she tell you that Royce was , as they say , intimate with her  --  sort of whenever the brute wanted to  --  for nine years ? " There . She had the family skeleton dangling on a string like the souvenir of a Mexican fiesta , and did n't the little fellow jiggle comically ? " You gave that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 're welcome , I 'm sure . " " Carole may have been alluding to it . I got what she meant . But , honey , she knows that 's all long ago and forgotten . " " The Gulf of War yawns between . " Priss yawned . " And there 's no use holding grudges . " " It is n't exactly a grudge that Carole holds ... " What then ? " " I do n't know . " With her hands she drew an urn shape in the air . Something ineffable . She would not tell him about the Giorgione landscape . " You ca n't name what she holds , so it 's nothing . It 's not right to resent what you ca n't even name . Carole is spotless ... " " Dad , you ought to marry her . Do n't take no for an answer . I mean , tuck her under your arm and drag her back to Wellfleet " " ... and you merely attribute designs to her . Your designs , mostp118likely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady and blame her for them . " " So you insist . Have you ever heard me utter a malicious word to or about her ? " Still the old man was not to be deterred . He had never trusted Priss for anything except to be herself , and if that was usually at least sufficient , there had been times when it was not . She had scared him sometimes ; the habit of fear returned to prompt him now . " Do n't let her marry that rascal , Priscilla . " He had given up calling her Priscilla in the same year she quit calling him Daddy . Priss chewed on great concerns while they silently searched the sky for a sign of Carole 's plane . They watched a DC-3 come in from Chicago and drag its clumsy tail up the runway toward the hangar . " And when does Carole expect this wedding to take place ? " she asked . " I told you it was , as far as I could tell , a spoof . Though she is n't very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , and it has a leetle moral point to it even for one as smart as you . " Priss laughed . " Oh , Jesus , you used to go all to pieces when I was a smart aleck . So I worked it up . It 's your fault . Why did n't you beat it the hell out of me with a club like a decent father , or drown me ? " While she spoke she meant it . In a minute she would not . " Yes , " he said regretfully , taking her hand in his soft and hairy paws . " The point is that Carole feels you  --  the Morgan family  --  got an unfortunate deal . That Royce was humiliated . And all that . " " She could n't stand it if he were . What about . . . ? " " Whatever she 's going to do , she feels it 's almost her duty to help straighten things out as they should be . " " Marrying Mooney would help ? " Priss shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he needs one thing to really establish him as lord mayor it 's to marry the Buchanan Packing Plant and have all that pretty money to play around with . " " She does n't think so . " " Carole 's not a great student of human character . As witness her weakness for me . " " I suppose not . But she was n't analyzing Mooney 's weaknesses.  |p119She  has the terrible notion  --  this is what she really tried to joke about  --  and it was funny  --  queer  --  that she 's a husband-killer . Carole as vampire ! " He snorted at the absurdity , which seemed to snort back rather terrifyingly , right into his face . " Her marriages must have been pretty bad . " " I guess they were . " Her tone broke the old man up . " Goddamn , but women are hard on women ! I would like to cry . " " Sorry , Pop . You 've got ta remember to whom you are addressing your human sentiments . Me , I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that . " " Who 's got him up in an airplane this afternoon ? Who remembers all his Reader 's Digest type sayings ? Who told Royce the kid was a king . . . of all things ? An unnatural wife . . . " More red herrings for the dear old seal who wanted so much for her to be good and herself at the same time . They were herrings , were n't they ? The red chunks of meat she was tossing ? " I did n't mean to criticize you , baby . " He searched her face hopefullyfor a sign of tears . If there were tears he could wipe them away . There were n't any . Contritely , impatiently , she said , " I know Carole had terrible marriagesand I can guess why , damn it . And anyone but a smart aleck would cry along with you , Pop . But . So ? So she thinks she might ruin old Mooney or lure him off to live the big life in Hawaii with the pineapples . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far away in the northeast she saw the sun catch a flaw in the sky . She lost it . Saw it again , larger and growing larger . It was Carole 's plane , carrying her son . The very minuteness of the little wings up there against all space brought home to her suddenly how much she trusted Carole , after all . Trusted at least some large competenceand some power , even if it was only the power of money . Then it occurred to her with the same fantastic abruptness that , yes , it was possible . Carole might be swept into a marriage with Mooney , even without her intervention . Some other forces  --  all thatp120erotic money , for example , to tempt the man  --  might move to the same end as her sick dream of marrying the woman to someone Royce would , beyond all other men , despise . She clutched her father 's shirt sleeve . A thrill of terror went through her as she understood that Something up there , watching from however far back in space It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the malice and unspeakable envy that had eaten her heart clean away . Something . . . She wanted to flee right home to Royce and ask him to kill it . Instead , of course , she waited for Lot and Carole , to greet them with hugs and laughter.  | " IT 'S SORDID , " Priss said . " It 's morbid and turbid . " " Who are they ? " Lot demanded from the back seat . " They are two blackbirds . Like Heckle and Jeckle , " Royce told him , shivering away the headed grass leaf with which the boy was tickling his ear . " You have great faith in my driving , buddy , or you would n't try these distractions . " Priss snatched the grass away . " White horse ! " she exclaimed . There on their right a dirty and yellowed white mare watched them skim the singing highway past her umber and ocher pasture . Priss licked her right thumb and stamped it in the gloved palm of her left hand . " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't stamp it , " Priss told him . " Watch for graveyards . They count twenty . Well , it is sordid , although the words amuses you , sweetie . The president of Wellford ca n't marry that tramp ! " " You older ladies of Buchanan will forbid it , " Royce said gravely . " You and Mrs. Dawson and Mrs. Firehurst and Mrs. Olmsby are , if I understand you rightly , concerned about the tarnish on the College if Mooney marries a lady of the theater . " " This time he 's going too far , " Priss warned . She did not , for the moment , mind being bracketed with the older ladies . This role gave her exactly the tone of indignation appropriate to Mooney 's latest outrage . After a summer of mysterious flittings and reappearances , a week after school began he had brought to the campus  --  not only to the campus but to the mansion itself , where she occupied thep122redecorated guest suite  --  a blowsy " opera star from Chicago " called Magda Farona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be well into her forties . To those like Priss who maintained , " But there are no opera stars in Chicago , " her development recalled Mae West sooner than the deep-chested divas of the Metropolitan . But Madam Farona had indeed entertained the Wellford students and faculty one Friday night in the chapel with " Highlightsfrom Wagner , " a couple of songs of Mahler 's , and encores of " The Last Rose of Summer " and " The Wellford Fight Song "  --  a program that had made Max Jarrell of the Music Department pound his head with astonishment , though he said the lady had a " first-rank " voice . Royce supposed that really the woman must have skipped sometime , somewhere , along the edge of fame , only to miss it because of some impertinence like drug addiction , mischance in love , or some psychic pathology whose symptoms would be revealed only in the misfiring of her whole life . She 's one of us , he thought to himself , rather liking the lady , rather constipated with melancholythese days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mooney , too , becalmed in their backwaters . Madam Farona had entertained the public one night  --  but by this time she had been resident in the mansion for almost two weeks . Coeds and faculty wives were all twittering rumors of romance  --  becausemost of them lacked character to rumor anything more sinister , and Mooney 's bulldog housekeeper dampened anyone 's tendency to fancy the worst . Built like old Mae West the singer might be , fresh from triumphs before the crowned heads of the underworld she could be ( at the farthest stretch of speculation ) , but if she were the Whore of Babylon herself the Protestant Mrs. Clifton would see that nothing untoward was done in her mansion . Mooney had gone out of his way to let the audience know Magda Farona was an old friend of his . He had gone over the heads of the Music Department in arranging her public appearance . So when she lingered eleven days , then twelve , after her concert , light female minds imagined Mooney in love . Priss and others saw sordidness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Royce said that late October afternoon as he drove home toward Buchanan . " He 's justp123teasing you all again , experimenting to see how far he can make people go in their speculations . " " Why ? " Priss asked . Royce shrugged , " Well , he likes to play with the world . It 's his toy . He does n't care about it the way the owners would . I 'm sure he was ready to let Wellford 's creditors foreclose last spring  --  as they would n't have really , perhaps  --  and go somewhere else without even bothering to remember he 'd been president here . He likes to see what will happen if he lights a fuse . Any fuse . " Lot , watching for a twenty-point cemetery to put him ahead of his mother , said , " How would they know if someone was dead , Daddy ? " " Listen for his breathing . Feel for his pulse . " " No . I mean , if somebody died in that house . " In the rear-view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmhouse set all by itself on a hilltop amid a morbid glory of red , black , and yellow leaves . The late-afternoon sun fired its windows . A slow flight of crows in the chill acetylene colors of the sky above it moved like the pallbearers dismissed from a grave . It was easy to see ( hard not to see ) how the house on an Illinois hill would seem to a child 's eye a house of death . So lonely . So silent at the end of a perspective . They had driven over to Galena that afternoon because Priss and Lot had never seen the Grant house there , and Priss  --  who did n't care much about Grant but was enthralled by the idea of Dick Diver " biding his time like Grant in Galena " in Fitzgerald 's novel  --  had wanted to sniff the source of the simile . What she found had not stuck to her ribs . So on the way home she got to " talking Mooney "  --  as half the College referred to one of its pastimes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royce said , " If someone died in that house , after a while the neighbors would wonder why they did n't see him . They 'd come and when they went in they 'd know he was dead . " Lot chewed his lip . " Well . . . " He did not want to be compassedby an answer , for his mind was called out toward infinity by the loneliness of late afternoon . He had not found Grant in Galena either , though he had stared at the musty rocking chairp124where Grant rocked while cancer grew in his throat , and had glanced impatiently at the old battle flags and medals . " No , " he said competitively , " I mean if everybody was dead , how would anybodyknow ? " " That 's a good question , sport , " Royce said . " The Greeks used to go around and ask each other that in Greek . I do n't recall that they ever got an answer to it . " He was thinking that when they drove into Buchanan , after Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , he and Priss would go for dinner at the Ringleby Dawsons ' . Over martinis , in front of a nice football-weather fire , he and Dawson would talk about Grant and the cabinet scandal and the Mississippi Valley campaign and the History Department budget and promotionsfor the new men Crawford and Blues , while Priss condescended so nimbly to Mrs. Dawson that the lady would hum like a happy teakettle . She would think that Priss had established exactly the right tone for conversation between a dean 's wife and the wife of a department head . And none of them would know that they had died . " Maybe the Martians would come and find out , " Lot said . Now that he had stumped the old man , he was willing to give ground and be reasonable . His father laughed immoderately  --  so much that his mother frowned her bewilderment . Let it be known that she deserved an explanation . " The Mooneys would come , " Royce said happily . " Do n't you see ? They 'd come with their Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if we were alive . " " You get too much pleasure from your mental life , " Priss said severely . " It 's time we straightened up and did something . " What she meant to do was turn up the volume of community disapproval so loud Mooney would have to ditch that yellow-haired singer and look for a more suitable wife . That was her intent . She did n't have to bother . Madam Farona took her trunk back to Chicago and after some interval Mooneyp125confided to Royce  --  perhaps only to Royce , one confidant never knew whether he was the sole secret-sharer or part of a mob individually pledged to keep Mooney 's secrets from each other  --  that his old friend Magda was a terrible lush . The trunk she had brought was mostly full of booze . After the concert she had opened her trunk , and had lain for three weeks in the mansion unfit to move , a risk to be moved by day or night . " I took a hideous chance in asking her to come , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here when I was sweating blood that the word would get out  --  or she 'd get out . Henceforward I owe a great deal to Mrs. Clifton for her loyalty . Loyalty 's the priceless virtue , is n't it ? And I wanted to give Magda some kind of a helpinghand . Poor girl is on the skids . " From this confidence , profound but still carefully circumscribed , no hint as to that life before in which Mooney had become poor Magda 's friend . . . or got his Rolls-Royce . . . or even found friends who would stake him to it . He gave not so much the shadow of magnitudes still undisclosed as simply a peep down a very deep well shaft . Royce was obliged to agree about loyalty  --  insofar , he thought , as there can be agreement between the hypothetically dead and the hypotheticallyMartian . Had playful Mooney found how a loyal action can serve a second function ? Had he not used the protracted and speculation-inviting visit of Magda Farona ( nee Mary Fox of Boston ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his position , marriageable ? In the market ? On the market ? Ready ( or nearly ready ) , eager ( though still unhastened as to choice ) , and prepared ( though his kingdom was not yet finished ) to take unto himself a consort ? As Mooney 's second year went on , Royce found that these questionsasked themselves . It appeared to him that Mooney was too exalted  --  and too busy  --  to court , but that he had signaled to all Buchanan that now he might be receptive to a suitable offer . Magda left behind her a biding question . Freshman coeds who had unquestioningly assumed that President Mooney was as old asp126God unfroze to the realization that , while he was neither young enough , callow enough , nor impulsive enough to stoop to their callow youth in making his choice , he had at least enough spunk in him to be called an eligible bachelor . Buchanan mothers who had only read about " eligible bachelors " in slick fiction or Chicago society pages decided , between relief and anxiety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be either threat or promise to their daughters of a nubile age . More or less as a chorus these mothers chanted the prophecy that if Mooney married in Buchanan  --  as he probably would n't , they thought  --  then it was likely he would choose either Carole Prentice or Celeste Armitage , both of splendid family and both thought to be in want of a prominent husband . Celeste was three years younger than Carole and had not been married . Yet Carole was thought to be the more likely prospect  --  perhaps because in the river-bottom silt of common speculation on the matter there still lay the memory of the years when many mothers had taken it for granted that Carole would someday be the wife of President Morgan . Pure old-woman stupidity honed off the edges of distinction between one man and another , one time and another , and the silty public mind was comforted to expect what it had always expected for Deirdre Prentice 's niece . In her role of visitor to faculty wives , Priss brought home some inklings of how Buchanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royce found her in their front hallway before the Victorianmirror in its mahogany stand , unpinning her hat . The smell of cold had come in on her fur coat . The mirror picked up Decemberreflections through the front-door pane . It was a pool of incandescence in the comfortable gloom . Priss rocked before it like the silhouetted priestess emerging from an oracle with tidings . And said , " Celeste Armitage is going to announce her engagementnext week . To a brewer . From Louisville . They understand that this is a concession . " " They ? Concession ? " Royce helped his wife out of her coat , saw her smile in the mirror like a rip of light , as if all the luminosityp127reflected from the snow outside were showing through her as it showed around her silhouette . " Why , she 's giving up the race to Carole . " " Race ? Good God , there 's no race . I have n't noticed Carole runninganywhere . " " They have , " Priss said , playfully tapping his midriff and edging past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire . " Or , if not running , then drifting . You 've noticed it too , Royce . Heaven knows I tried to give Carole something to paddle with . I mean the ceramics thing and . . . well , going out of my way to be such friends with her . But she drifts . She does n't go away from Buchanan and there 's nothing for her to do here . Except marry Mooney , of course . It 's so logical . " " Logical ? " Even a grave and sober man might squawk the word in such connections . There was not the faintest logic in anything Priss was saying , nor in the process she was probably reporting correctly . There was , however , something more formidable than logic , a subrational movement  --  an almost inorganic process like that by which a river shifts its bed . Grains of silt were moving toward a configuration as inevitable as it was , by reason , unpredictable . He was old enough to understand that what Priss had to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . As a historian he believed that historic events were often only convenient labels for great determinations made invisibly . " So it 's all over but the shouting ? " he asked . " Carole will marry him ? " If he were to ask Carole herself such a question now  --  but it was part of the configuration that he must not ask  --  she might not know what on earth he was talking about . Yet somehow she would know , too . Somehow , profoundly , she would be bound in the female confederacy without regard to her own objective interests . " It 's not by any means all over , " Priss mocked , easing her lithe body into the sofa cushions . Her thin cheeks glowed from her walk through the cold . " Heavens . I 'm sure it will never happen . I do n't think Mooney will ever marry anyone . " " Then you were n't serious in your indignation about Madam Farona. "  | " I was too ! " A pause while Priss decided which level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? Perhaps I was n't . But I felt indignant whether there was reason to be so or not , so it 's just the same . " " No . " " Yes , " the relativist said , enjoying her freedom of movement among contradictory truths if nothing else . " The point is it 's just unbearablyfascinating to see how in a small town like this such a ground swell gets started and moves . I 'm the only bitch of them all who 's unkind enough to put it into words . " She laughed and stretched lazily before the fire , as if it were her element , from which for a little while she had ascended to be a shopping tourist amid the quaint moralities of the world . " You 're taking all my fancies calmly . Is it because you think they 're all so frothy ? " Royce shook his head . " How would you feel if she really did marry him ? " He shrugged . " Would you let it happen ? Would you let her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no power of decisionin the matter  --  then saw the trap . If he answered so , Priss would take him in the lie . Yes , it was constantly in his power to go to Carole and take advantage of her aimlessness to send her away  --  to send her away , at least , from such present dangers as Buchanan contemplated to others unknown . That is , he might muster the voice of authority , might loom in front of her like a very palpable ghost , shout " Boo , " and scare her away . But the dead sometimes have intimations that they have died . He knew how and where the Royce who had the right to decide for Carole had died . So he said , " Thank God for the reality principle . You ladies readingtea leaves may predict marriage . I 'm not sure that Mooney will notice he 's engaged just because you discern the propriety of mating him and Carole . Why should he want Carole when he 's got Tommy Barker ? " Last year Freshman Barker had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Halstead down . This year .. . Since early December when the basketball season opened , it appeared that Mooney had uncannily picked himself a winner from Bronkley . Of course Tommy had starred at Lincoln High , but that was an inadequate prediction of what he was beginning to do now . A genius was emerging from the wraps ( or rather , from the scarlet and white Wellford sweatclothes ) . On the hardwood courts he was explicating Mooney 's promises in language that anyone could understand . To state senators , to bankers and industrialists , to small businessmen still smarting over defaulted debts , to packinghouseworkers and spastic newsboys , he was carrying the word that Wellford could be big time . The females of Buchanan might tizzy about the eligibility of the bachelor president . The gents figured that , while he might have sailed pretty close to the edge of tolerance when he was boffing that singer and keeping her right in his house , he sure knew before they did what stuff there was in the Barker kid . Clear now in retrospect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion about the attack on Miss Halstead . Not so clear was how Mooney had seen the full potential of Tommy 's talents . " It 's not a prophetic gift , " Royce said . " It 's just a bird-dog sense for the main chance . It must have started with an if  --  if Tommy becamesensational . . . . Tommy 's becoming sensational , so now , withoutneeding clairvoyance , Mooney can see chances for the publicity he trusts more than our traditional methods . In publicity he sees wealth for the school , and in a wealthy school he sees the chance to build his monument . In his monument  --  still far ahead  --  he sees himself . Will a man in pursuit of himself be diverted by mere matrimony ? " " Not all wives are obstacles . " " I 'm not suggesting Carole might be . " " Still . . . I can see his hesitation about her . She 's getting to be a terrible lush . " " Nonsense ! "  | " I can understand you 'd defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I blame her for this . I have some notion of what it meant to her to watch Deirdre go . I 'm only stating the simple truth . " " You let Lot go flying with her . " " She is n't canned all the time . She 's not an alcoholic . I 've never seen her when she was n't quite sober enough to do whatever she 'd promised . Granted . Granted . Why do you get so hot when I say the obvious about her ? Only ... " " I misdoubt the balance of what you call obvious . " " ... would n't it be ironic if he found her unsuitable as wife of a man in his position ? " " Ironic beyond bearing . But why do n't you write a novel if you want to give such concreteness to possibilities and anxieties ? " " Oh , I 'm going to . Do n't worry . You 'll all be in my story some-time . " " The point is we 're talking about nothing more substantial than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that Carole is unmarried and for the moment directionless . That does not add up to the necessity for either of them to consider the other seriously . I can promise you that Mooney will get more mileage toward what he really wants by bringing in a gaudy subject for rumor like Magda Farona from time to time than he 'd ever get out of a common marriage . I 'm afraid your tea-table speculation has left the man 's real genius for managing sensationalism out of account . " " You 'd rather talk about Barker , who is a bore , " Priss said . " O.K. I 've touched your defenses about Carole and I 'm sorry . But anyway it 's interesting to hear them all guess she might marry him . Do you suppose there could be something prescriptive  --  sort of compulsory  --  about their expectations ? That Carole would feel it was her duty to do what Buchanan expected ? " Whatever he supposed , he was afraid there might be compulsion for a woman who had so little to anchor on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't mean to change the subject . " Priss acknowledged this with a drowsy nod . " It 's always Mooney , really . Why should people talk about him so much ? "  |p131Because  they saw in him a show of life they could no longer claim to show themselves ? A few days later  --  it was still January then  --  Priss came home to announce , " She 's dated him . " " Dated ! " Royce grunted his disdain for the word , though of course Priss had only chosen it to tease him . The facts were merely that Mooney and Carole had made a couple for drinks and dinner at the Bojacs ' and had gone with them later to the showing of an art film in Litchfield Auditorium . Though their appearance together would surely be commented on  --  and the comment become part of the force of their drift  --  the only thing that surprised Royce was Priss 's hearing of it at second hand . Carole was still coming to their house five times a week  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy from kindergarten or to see them all if she had an excuse  --  and when she did not come for morning gossip over coffee with Priss she often called . If she had any secrets from Priss , these were probably secrets from herself as well . But now she had " dated " Mooney , and she had not known how to tell the Morgans about it . It was the sign of a new phase . " Things are coming along , " Priss said . She offered another surprise to her husband . " I 'm going to give him the studio . " There was something in her tone of the well-practiced courtesan yielding one more favor as a reward for her suitor 's constancy or good behavior . " After all , I suppose there 's not much point going on with the jugs now that Carole 's stopped pretending any interest . " " I 'm sorry she has . But you ca n't force enthusiasms on people . You helped her through a rough time . " " Is n't that a nice thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither do I. It 's just another sign of her will to debase herself . " " You 're giving up too . Why should it mean something different for Carole than for you ? " " It does n't ! " she flared . She stared at him in mock wonder . " You big fool , it 'd probably ruin you to find out how negative women really mean to be . But the difference remains that Carole 's a farmer and I 'm not that . She 's luckier than I. "  | " She did n't marry a man ignorant of woman 's real nature . " She was almost through minding irony from him . Once it might have wounded and set her to elaborate introspection . Now it mainly amused her . " My other elements I give to baser life , ' " she said hammily . " I take the veil . In pure charity I ca n't compete with my husband and my guide  --  who proves it by sucking Mooney 's ass so long . Oh , I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her meaning lay beyond human speech . She had merely said the words the way a child discharges a firearm , because he can . " As long as you withhold such sentiments in front of . . . those who might be hurt by them , " he said with terrible , cold , ponderous gravity . His eyes were on her , but utterly blank . In panic she tried to bluff swiftly away from the moment . " Sure . You 're used to my colorful and picturesque manner of speech . Not everyone is . Anyway , pro bono publico . With this year 's enrollment in the Art Department they need the space if nothing else . Bojac has promised to send Tom LeCoeur out to do the actual work . " " LeCoeur 's a painter , is n't he ? " Royce knew very well what the young man was . He had recruited LeCoeur from the Art Institute in the previous spring , knew and liked him as well as any of the recent additions to the faculty . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you see I have n't really given up anything . I 'll be around for most of the classes . He 's done a little ceramics . You object to this ? " " I was only a little surprised by the way it was presented to me . " " Well , I 've already told Mooney I would . Do n't worry . I may be an unnatural mother and Carole would be a better one , but nobody'sgoing to suffer from neglect . Lot  --  " " I was n't thinking of him . " He was wondering , suddenly , what else she might recently have planned with Mooney , for he heard in her disquiet the accent of treachery . Yet he knew that she would have said nothing more of great import to Mooney . She would not have discussed Carole Prentice in any way with the man . She would not need to . If he was beginning to see her game , he saw that its cardinal communications would not be made in direct speech . Shep133was giving a little something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direction she approved . He had been seen with Carole . He would know now that Mrs. Morgan not only approved but might have more than the use of her studio in store if he held this direction . " You 're angry , are n't you ? " Priss said in a contrite voice . And Royce thought , my God , she does n't even know what she 's doing . Not wholly . Am I to be the only one who has to see it all ? He was not so much angry as afraid . On Saipan he had bargained to be the domino that did not go down into blindness and worse with the rest . He had not foreseen all that obliged him to . At that moment , he would recall years afterward , he had known that Carole would be married to Winfred Mooney . Tied to the rock of that knowledge , he heard his wife ask if he was angry . " I wo n't do it if you say no , " she told him , coming to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin and turned his head so that the blank eyes were on her again . " I can still call it off . Hell , I 've got so much to do with my life ! " " I 'm sorry for you , too . " " Hell , I do n't have to teach . I can write my novel . " Of course their quarrel  --  if it had been that  --  was composed with an effective denial that it had ever erupted . Little by little it was accepted that the studio in the Morgans ' back yard was committed to the Wellford Art Department for the second semester , and that of course Priss would supervise the classes in ceramics taught there . Mooney went out of his way to thank Royce  --  no , to thank the Morgan family  --  for this service to the College . Not his College . Their College . If he saw any of the strings Priss had attached to the offer and was still manipulating , then Royce was very much mistaken in his analysis of the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the strings were there . Still playing blind , he was guided simply by a confidence that there was always more than met the eye in any circumstance  --  and that , perhaps , this faith alone would bring him profit . Of course he had never wanted the use of the studio for its ownp134sake . Then for the sake of what ? Because the strings attached led on through the black maze toward where the hero waited with a sword to lop off his grotesque head and horns ? Myth might tell where Minotaur Mooney was headed , but there was no way of transposingmyth into the language used to settle everyday affairs . " I 'm glad it 's been arranged , " Royce told Mooney . " As much for Priss 's sake as the College 's . She needs . . . " " I know , I know , " Mooney said . That was his advantage . To know that Priss needed something so badly that she might sell off her husband for its sake . What it was she needed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Thomas Q. Barker of Wellfordwas nominated All-American forward by sports writers in Buchanan , Dubuque , Nashville , and Lincoln , Nebraska . He was mentioned as a " hope " for next year 's All-American by writers in San Francisco , St. Louis , and Brooklyn . Item : Mrs. Priscilla London Morgan and Miss Barbara Overbeck , returning to the Morgan home on March 18 , 1948 , at 3.45 P.M. , after shopping at the A &P; and the RoseJohn Delicatessen , entered the front door to find Mrs. Carole Prentice Slater ( widow ) on the couch with Master Lot Harvey Morgan . Mrs. Slater was bouncing the six-year-old boy on her knee while she sang : This is the way the gentleman rides . Gallopy-gallopy , gop . This is the way the lady rides . Trittity-trottity , trot . And this is the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Morgan and Miss Overbeck , Mrs. Slater , in the midst of her song , was seen to color beet red , but not to desist from bouncing the boy . At the completion of the song , Mrs. Morgan remarked to her sonp136that he was much " too heavy " to be bounced any longer on Mrs. Slater 's knee . Master Morgan replied that they had only done this  --  while awaitingmother and maid  --  because they " used to do it when he was little " and he had begged the entertainment once more " for old times ' sake . " While watching the floor-shaking , mirth-provoking , blush-bringing , rapid up-and-down of the young rider on his steed , Mrs. Morgan had said to herself ( silently ) : Dear God , she 's big . Dear God , she 's strong as a mare .

Item : Dean of Studies , alias Dean of Students Royce Blackburn Morgan declined with thanks two tentative offers of appointment from , respectively , Tulane University and Antelope Valley Junior College , the former an offer of a deanship , the latter an offer of presidency . The tone of his refusal , regretful . The reasons given , spurious . Letters of gratitude were also dispatched over the dean 's signature to Brigadier General Archibald Greave , 27th Division U.S.A. ( Infantry ) , Professors Hieveland , Buckley , and Kolbinger of Columbia University , and Sergeant Lawrence Wolff , 27th Division U.S.A. ( Infantry ) Inactive Reserve , resident in Antelope Valley , California . Gratitude was deanishly expressed for instigating these offers of appointment . Item : On the anniversary of her alleged assault in the Wellford College Library ( Grant Hall ) , Miss Vivian Elizabeth Halstead did issue or prepare to issue to the faculty of Wellford College and to the trustees and to the Buchanan Courier Sentinel a mimeographed pamphlet of nine pages entitled " The Case against Winfred Mooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officesp137by Dean Royce Morgan , acting on intelligence supplied by Hopkins Halstead ( brother ) and Mrs. Hopkins Halstead , in the sense that " Vivian has got something terrible she is trying to pass around . " Intercepted , Miss Halstead tearfully affirmed to Dean Morgan that all copies of the pamphlet were still in her possession ( in the trunk of her Pontiac ) and that only she , her brother , and her sister-in-law had yet read the charges therein . Dean Morgan 's inspection of the one hundred copies entrusted to him by distraught Miss Halstead revealed that the charges fell in categories : ( r ) Fiscal Slackness  --  The refusal to honor debts contractedby Wellford College ; the acceptance of kickbacks from glaziers , electricians , interior decorators employed by the College . ( 2 ) Demoralization of Academic Disciplines  --  The discharge of " respectedmembers of the teaching staff and associated services " and the hiring of " green youth , many of whom have not a Ph.D .

( q ) Sexual Deviation and Promiscuity  --  Keeping his " known mistress " in the presidential mansion ; setting " one of his creatures " to the mission of criminally assaulting or " carnally humiliating " the undersigned ; entering homosexual relationshipswith Billy Cox , Lon C. Breckenridge , and F. Milton Santiana ( the latter two interior decorators who had refurbished the president 's mansion , the former of unknown employment ) ; humiliatingsecretaries and freshman girls by " obscene utterances .

" ( There were notes about his amours even in the girls ' toilets of the library . ) She had seen and overheard Clackfart in highly suspicious conversation with the two decorators from Chicago during their work on the mansion . " Billy Cox " was probably a pseudonym of the sort that deviants are known to take . But , if required by his skepticism , she could take Dean Morgan to the very barber who kept the still-dark roots of President Mooney 's hair from creeping up into the white . The barber would confirm this proof positive of " inversion . " The president bleached his hair " like Jean Harlow " !

For Miss Halstead , the charity one accords the shell-shocked veteran transformed into an arsonist . For President Mooney , the charity of disbelieving all the specific charges of the pamphlet , and of doubting that the general ones were phrased with sufficient objectivity to be admissible in the determination of public opinion . For himself , the charity of thinking that no respect for the free dissemination of opinion could have brought either more happiness or enlightenment than his swift suppression of Miss Halstead'sunlicensed printing . Item : Master Lot Morgan threw and decorated " a Grecian urn " to replace his original creation , which had burst in the firing a year ago . The accident demoralized him so long he had done no more work in clay until he saw his mother busy with the Wellford students , who now came four times a week to work in the stable studio .

Item : At the instigation ( or perhaps in emulation ) of President Winfred C. Mooney , valued ideas , notions , or projects were , by the majority of the administration and by an increasing minority of faculty and students , labeled " seminal .

Mildred ( Millie ) Donovan was ostentatiously enceinte at the time of her husband 's appointment . In view of the desirability of maintaining a demonstrable balance of sexual characteristics in the Donovan family ( and henceforward among all personnel or premises pertaining to the Wellford Library ) , Dean Royce Morgan said of Mrs. Donovan 's pregnancy , with a thin laugh , " She had better produce a girl . " Mrs. Donovan did . Item : In conference with Colmar Jensen ( basketball coach ) and William Casey ( director of athletics and football coach ) , President Mooney declared , " You are not thinking big enough . " Mr. Jensen , supported by Mr. Casey , expressed doubts about the basketball scheduleproposed by President Mooney for the coming season . Each separately and both conjunctively objected that however stellar thep140performance of Thomas Q. Barker might continue to be , he could not singlehandedly sustain the Wellford Five against the competidonof Oklahoma , Nevada , and N.Y.U. , top teams proposed as Wellfordadversaries by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the proposed schedule was , " It is a seminal idea . " President Mooney riposted , " Do I have to do it myself ? " Mr. Jensenand Mr. Casey were required on this and following occasions to be in attendance at the president 's office while , by telephone , PresidentMooney assembled what was described later by informed members of the Economics Department as an athletic cartel . Sports writers and editors of known disposition were induced and presently obliged to use their influence with top teams that might have had reason for avoiding Wellford . Managers of sports arenas in New York , Chicago , St. Louis , and Los Angeles were offered package deals of Wellford vs . Nevada , Wellford vs . Oklahoma , Wellford vs . N.Y.U. Only in the event of their acceptance did they find themselvesunder the necessity of adding pleas and inducements to N.Y.U. , Oklahoma , and Nevada to accept engagements unilaterally announced by President Mooney . Mr. Casey grasped the semantics of " seminality " more rapidly than his associate Mr. Jensen . When to him Mr. Jensen white-liveredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But where will we get a team to go with Barker ? " Mr. Casey then proposed to President Mooney that he once more lift the Bell telephone and address himself to Mr. Charles Dowling of Philadelphia , called ( on sports pages and perhaps in the locker room ) " Dolly . " It was Mr. Casey 's implication that Mr. Dowling would know where and how rapidly to recruit a team fit to support Mr. Barker through the coming years . With Mr. Dowling hired as basketball coach , it was then proposed by Mr. Casey that Mr. Jensen be retained to teach boxing , squash , gymnastics , fencing , and cross-country walking . In short , that he be superseded like Dean Morgan , Coach Melanevski , Librarian Halstead , and the Mesdemoiselles Tabor ( not to speak of others gone or overrun ) by an effective of the new regime .

Item : Upon leaving a student production of Twelfth Night , presented in Litchfield Auditorium , Dean and Mrs. Morgan discovered that an April snowstorm had made their expected path from the auditorium to the parking lot behind Arden Hall impassable . Mrs. Morgan rejoiced in the snow as it blew astronomical configurations ( exploding nova and compressed centuries of unhindered drift ) around the lamps bordering the sidewalk . Dean Morgan reflected on the health of the new grass and crocuses beneath this untimely storm . Detouring , the couple encountered President Mooney and Mrs. Slater walking together toward the presidential mansion . The followinginterlocution established that President Mooney had enjoyed his evening at the play . Mrs. Slater said it was " Fine . Oh , just fine .

The copulation was , on Professor LeCoeur 's part , essentially unpremeditated . On Mrs. Morgan 's part , long premeditated , often rejected as unthinkable , as often meditated again with the stipulation that since she could not only think of it but find in it some symbolic focus for obsessive and painful emotions , the moral act ( adultery ) was for her equilibrium necessary and the physical actp142(coitus) was for the moral act an indispensable basis . In selecting a partner Mrs. Morgan had been guided by considerations of facility and the emotional neutrality of both participants , since direct emotionalinvolvement would not only lead to boring sequelae but would distract from the central objective sought  --  the exorcising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first mistress . Intercourse was achieved in the bedroom occupied for thirty-two years by Miss Grace Blackburn ( now resident at Pacific Palisades , California ) . At the specific insistence of Mrs. Morgan it was performedon the floor where eighteen years previously her present husbanddeflowered Miss Carole Prentice . Instead of **51;5203;TOOLONG fantasiesthat during the act past time would be reconstructed in her favor ( so that the hymen here surrendered would be hers and not Miss Prentice 's ) , her only escape from the distasteful realities of lying half clothed under a relative stranger was the momentary hallucinationthat she was being penetrated by a horned and bull-faced chimera , and that this creature was Winfred Mooney , president of Wellford College . Mrs. Morgan predictably failed to achieve orgasm . From postcoital fright but undiminished gallantry worthy of his Gallic forebears or his recent comrades in the ri5th Regiment ( Airborne ) , Professor LeCoeur asked if this April delight could be , the occasion favoring , repeated . Mrs. Morgan replied , " Do n't be a goddamnfool . " In postcoital disappointment and the consequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son returned at the expected hour , Mrs. Morgan regained composure by the cheerlessrecollection that , since marriage , this was her fourth adulterous deviation , the others having occurred during her husband 's service in the Pacific theater . None of them either , in her accounting , had reached its ineffable objective or brought her peace . Mrs. Morgan laughed ruefully to recall that her first adultery had the fantasied objective of magically producing mail from her husband when , duringthe Saipan campaign , she had been twelve days without word of him . Mrs. Morgan , completing her make-up before her mirror ,  |p143|paused  as if turned to stone by some vision therein while she stared and said , " Darling , you ought to kill me . Come home , you sonofabitch , I want to eat you up . " Item : Miss Vivian Elizabeth Halstead ( emeritus ) of Wellford Collegeleft Buchanan to make her home in La Jolla , California . Item : To Dean Morgan , Mrs. Morgan expressed the wish that " in the near future " the Morgans might have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his view to entertain President Mooney and Mrs. Slater would indeed be a welcome part of the spring social calendar . In view of the fact that his former military superior would in early May stop for two nights in Buchanan , that occasion might serve for a most enjoyable dinner party , of which " they " would make part . He suggested as another guest Mrs. Jennifer Sparling ( divorced ) , a friend of his grade-school days , reputed lively . Not slow to discern her husband 's administrative touch , Mrs. Morgan demandedwhether General Greave was married . She was told he was a widower , whereupon she gave it as her opinion that Jennifer Sparlingwas altogether too apt to " latch on " to President Mooney in the course of such an evening , since Mr. Sparling had also served his time in the advertising world from which President Mooney came and " poor Carole " would be stuck with a " stuffy old brass hat . " Mrs. Morgan 's evident passion ended the argument and prevented Dean Morgan from retorting that Arch Greave had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely shock poor Carole than bore her . Item : To Chancellor George Hand came the not entirely agreeablesurprise of reading in a national news magazine that " seambustingWellford College " out in Illinois had instituted a Veteran 's Degree . " The no-skimping B.A. can be earned in two and a half years by young men in a hurry . " While such a degree had been a subject of conversation among President Mooney , Chancellor Hand , and Dean Morgan , agreement had been that Wellford would be guilty of fraud in promulgating such a program . President Mooneyp144himself had finally taken the firmest stand against it , but , confronted with the magazine , admitted ( after a preliminary sneer at " **28;5256;TOOLONG " ) that he had given the story to a stringer in St. Louis while on a fund-raising trip to that city . To Chancellor Hand 's question , " Does this oblige us . . . ? " President Mooney answered with alacrity that it obliged Wellford to nothing  --  not even , he supposed , to answering the inquiries that would pour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perceiving how he had nonplussed his right hand , he changed his tone and expressed ( in the subjunctive ) a regret for the necessity to use publicity conceivably embarrassing to the College , though , as Dean Morgan and Chancellor Hand had heretofore agreed , the generalidea was a seminal one . Wellford must be , whenever possible , in his view , seminal in the world of education , and if such a program were beyond its means , the torch had now , figuratively speaking , been flung to stronger hands . ( Though in his view no hand was stronger than Chancellor Hand . No , sir . ) Item : Estimates of next year 's enrollment at Wellford : 2,200 students . Item : Thomas Q. Barker appeared at the Rotary luncheon on April 28 in company with President Mooney and the newly arrived Dolly Dowling . President Mooney spoke . Dolly Dowling shook both hands over his head in the manner of a prizefighter . Barker blushed when presented with cuff links in the form of gold basketballs . One earnest Rotarian said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . " He did not offer the one off his back , perhaps feeling such a gesture to be inappropriate to the solemnity of the occasion . Item : Brigadier General Archibald Greave of New Orleans visited in the home of Dean and Mrs. Royce Morgan of Buchanan . He was entertained at dinner on May 7 by the company of President Mooney , Mrs. Carole Prentice Slater , Professor and Mrs. Ringleby Dawson , Professor and Mrs. Milton Bojac , Professor and Mrs. Max Jarrell ,  |p145and  Professor and Mrs. Wilton Emory . Mrs. Jennifer Sparling sat at home and played tiddlywinks ; at any rate she sat at home , thus demonstrating to the satisfaction of Dean and Mrs. Morgan who wore the pants in the Morgan family . In anticipation of embarrassing questions from the bemedaled veteranof high rank as to what he did during the war , President Mooney launched early into a modest and humorous recital of how the firm of Messer and Breton ( 570 Madison Ave. , New York City ) had " sold " the war effort . In his view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an account executive during the period of crisis . To the American public at large Messer and Breton had introduced " some splendid writers  --  novelists and poets and radio writers , not to mention great writers like Milton , Tom Mann , and Tom Paine . " Much historical material that might have remainedunknown to the citizenry was , by the occasion and by the stable at Messer and Breton , brought alive into the public heart by the passion of advertising . General Greave replied that he was indeed gratified by the distinctionsbetween American propaganda and that unleashed by our late enemies and particularly by the infamous Dr. Goebbels . Upon the departure of the guests , two by two , General Greave , over a nightcap , remarked to Dean Morgan , in Mrs. Morgan 's presence , " You and your lady have a good situation here . I sense boom in the air and at last I begin to understand why you turned down Tulane . " The remark occasioned firstly certain discursive analogies with the choice by General of the Armies Douglas MacArthur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East in the shaping of the postwar world . " Only . . . " As General Greave essayed a return from his analogy , flattering to the youth and vision of his host , and giving it its present application to the situation at Wellford College , he hesitated tactfully after saying , " Only . . . " " Only . . . Mooney ! " said vivacious Lady Morgan , never reluctant to take the creature by its horns , nor to utter what reticence passed over in silence . " I tried to warn you he was a nonpareil . " And though indeed she had , prior to the dinner hour , commentedp146shrewdly on the character of Wellford 's president , her delight in the astonishment of the insufficiently warned observer passed common bounds . " It 's hard to visualize Royce taking orders from him , " graciously suggested General Greave , blushing as an elderly Southern gentlemanmay upon observing horns in a lady 's hands . " I suppose my work is rather to put some content into his whims , " Dean Morgan explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw the future , and it works , General . This is the age of Mooney , which your victorious arms have won . " General Greave hoped that the thought might perish . As Dean and Mrs. Morgan prepared to retire into that bed where Miss Grace Blackburn had slept so many peaceful years , Mrs. Morganexpressed the hope that " they " could be invited alone sometime in the near future . " Just the four of us . It is ripening . " She was asked how she could determine love 's  --  or perhaps only matrimony 's  --  progress . She declared , " Because Carole has more and more things she wo n't talk about , and I want to see . " Pantsless Dean Morgan agreed to her wish . Item : Urging the disgraceful lack of imagination among the hairdressersin Buchanan ( and secretly recording Mrs. Slater 's lack of imagination in her failure to seek the superior skills available in Chicago ) , Mrs. Morgan prevailed upon her friend , Mrs. Carole Slater , to permit her the privilege of restyling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Slater gratefully and almost cringingly assented ) Mrs. Morgan exploited those arcane powers devolving upon the manipulator of another 's tresses to induce a state comparable to the effect of sodium pentothal ( truth serum ) with the end of hearing " from the horse 's mouth " what was toward between Mrs. Slater and President Winfred Mooney . She was satisfied merely that , in the responses to her delicate inquisition , Mrs. Slater lied . Item : On the morning of his nativity in late May , Dean Royce Morgan encountered , on a campus sidewalk somewhat closer top147Arden Hall ( Administration ) than to Stack Hall ( Art , Domestic Science , and Biology ) , Professor M. Thomas LeCoeur . In response to the dean 's observation that this was a day of great beauty , ProfessorLeCoeur , beauty-lover , replied that Yes , it was indeed , since he had this day received appointment to the staff of Nebraska State Teachers ' College at Peru , Nebraska . Dean Morgan expressed heartfelt regret , the more so that this news should come to him upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of the new men on whom the good hopes of Wellford rested , and most because the explosive expression of thanksgiving for the opportunity to be away from Wellford signaledsome unspeakable and perhaps unguessable resentment . At the expression of administrative regret , Professor LeCoeur ( a man six years younger than the dean and more impulsive , not to say accustomed to wearing a bohemian heart on his undersleeve ) said , " How long are you going to stand it , Morgan ? " Considering the rudeness of this question merely significative , Dean Morgan silently questionedfurther . And heard , " I mean being screwed by people who are n't in the same league with you and you know it . " Considering the verb ( inf. to screw ) not so much offensive in the context as strange , Dean Morgan mildly asked who was , in the artist 's view , screwing him , and was answered with a dark nod to Professor LeCoeur 's left , perhaps indicating the presidential mansion or perhaps the planet Mars . Then Professor LeCoeur said , sighing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and without further clarification took his way toward Peru , Nebraska . Item : As the approach of the June convocation announced the end of this , now his third , year of biding his time on the Wellford scene , Dean Morgan , private and perpetual taker of stock , father , husband , dean , friend , adviser , butt , witness , analyst and Heaven 's analysand , idler , strong domino , amateur of history , disengaged lover , and unstungcuckold , took stock and concluded ( tentatively ) : That his talents , if not his manhood , were fully employed by Wellford College , Anno 1948.  |p148His  manhood ? That which must have been the outcome of genetic , intellectual , and environmental preparations antedating his birth in Buchanan 's Mercy Hospital and of his own early cognitions , determinations , essays , intimations , and adaptation to the then prevailingand from the foundations of the earth expanding limitations of reason , as well as to the less discernible but more prescriptive contentsof the subconscious ( racial or personal ) , to myths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . That which once with purpose was projected temporally forward to the then unpredictable  --  and indeed undetermined  --  present ; projected if not with hope , since without prediction hope is unthinkable , then with the confidencea thinking rock might entertain that when it has fallen it will still be a rock ( in his case the confidence that in whatever compositionof improvised or accidental circumstance he would still be a man ) . That which , alas , was forbidden on pain of extinction to identifyor justify itself by its adequacy to the employment of any transientpresent whatever , either the present of administrative wisdom , or of domestic harmony , or of libidinous involvement . That which must be owned but never possessed , defended but never saved , honoredbut never credited . His talents ? For soothing and resettling ancient librarians , female . For patient and tolerant amusement where approval or affection was impossible . For being a good daddy where fatherhood was , in the sense required by the self for emergence from its hermitic isolation , denied . For observing the formalities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained only erotic and ethical fixationsupon a future once glimpsed and already antedated , for whose sake he had perhaps immortally frustrated the ideal capacity for love in not one but two women , wife and long-time mistress . For directingextensions in the Master of Arts program . For treading water in the gulf between the minds of his colleagues . For interposing mind , heart , and pants ( their still vital contents if need be ) between the alien souls in his charge and the more immediate of the disasters for which they clamored.  |p151THE  MORGANS ' HousE  --  that mere physical shell which so mildly , constantly , and capriciously subverted Royce Morgan 's attempts to take stock reasonably  --  never quite revealed its enchantments so clearly as in June weather . It was a house " that if it had been any bigger could n't have been wooden , " Lot Morgan said , young Lot who was beginning to believe that he had always lived there . Except for the trim , the entire house was clapboarded . Even the stumpy and faintly romanesque arches supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house were faced with a ruche of clapboard texture . The long , long slopes of the shingled roof , broken front and rear with so many ample dormers and a transverse second and third story like a collided smaller house going its own way , had the dimensions of an eighteenth-century ship of the line . And in fact there were features throughout the structure ( from the compact , paneled , and low-ceilinged study to the proliferation of windows on the side which once had unobstructedly overlookedthe river ) that retained some recessive traits of naval architecture . It was as if the prospering landlubber who conceived the house had not been quite able to forget the voyage that brought him or his ancestors to the new country . White on its gently sloping knoll , in the snowy months it loomed like an ice palace among the grand maples and elms of the lawn . When the porch screens were down and snow mounded on the wide porch rails or crusted sootily on the battleship-gray porch floor the house seemed to draw in upon itself like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through any winter . A boy Lot Morgan 's age might crouch some winter afternoon behind the clapboardedrailings with his cheek just touching a spot of snow and , staring from the hermitage of his imagination , stare the mild , surroundingsuburb out of existence . Then he could see a country rich with savages and benign wild animals . In spring and autumn when the sparse foliage around the house would dissolve  --  from certain sidewalk vantage points a block or a block and a half away  --  the geometry of roof line and corners , the house could look like a giant , ermine balloon grounded until some wind might get under it and sweep it back where it came from . But in June , when the trees were fully leaved and the sail-sized black screens walled the porch and the light of any hour in the twenty-four broke all but its sculptured mass into patterns of dark ( dark green , blue , deep violet , or black ) and white , the airy house sat on its knoll like a comfortable ark which life-loving Methodists had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sense about it of well-curried creatures just departed , two by two , for a romp on the grass or a sniff at the orchard and barn of their new environment . The movement of a June breeze along one of the varnishedupstairs halls , or heat rising delicately in the back stairwell toward the lofty attic , the scarcely audible throb of the big fans pumping basement air through the heating pipes were intimations , for a boy Lot Morgan 's age , of worlds beyond worlds of which these stairways , banisters , closets , kitchen , and flowered walls were a part . It was a house of odors and murmurs , best in June . And for a boy of Lot Morgan 's whimsically judicious temperament , just the sort of house where a big gray stud of a car ( to which on a football afternoon he had pledged allegiance ) should come in a June twilight bringing the sweet lady with whom he once played horse and a snaky impostor with hair the color of God 's . Since they were not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose not even to greet them , he watched Carole 's arrival with Mooney from behind the curtain of his open bedroom window . Fingering his just-bathed testicles , he watched them come up the walk smiling and disappear under the rain gutterp153rimming the porch roof . He heard his mother 's voice ring like the nice little bell his teacher used to get order in the classroom . They would n't pull anything on his mother tonight , whatever they had come for . He heard his father 's deeper , edgeless voice laughing a welcome , and heard Carole say , " Oh ! " as if the roses his mother had arranged in a great bouquet on the cocktail table were , this time , no fooling , more than she could bear . He listened for Mooney , expecting a hiss , but heard only the other three in June-cadenced talk , no duller but certainly no more interesting to him than if he had been able to make out all the words . He withdrew into his room , put on a light , spun the old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new stamps had come from , then threw himself face down on the coverletof his bed , where he had stacked the books he meant to look at before sleeping . There was one about a white stallion the cowboys could never catch . Another was about everything that had wheels . There was another about birds and he tried to figure out which bird his mother was most like . His figuring came out the same as every other time he looked at the book . Unsatisfactory as it was , she looked like the sleek little sparrow hawk leaning down commandingly from a telephone pole , daring anything to show its head in the sickening greenery of the watercolor field . White-haired Mooney was a raven , of course , because the raven 's eyes , the way they were set like a hunter 's aiming down a rifle barrel , had always scared him . Carole was the big fat white duck . It made him giggle the way the curved underfolds of the duck 's body hung down around yellow legs like something hanging down around something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , as it said in his text , there were no more trumpeter swans . All gone now , but oh , Jesus , oh , wow , what a bird it was , like a ton of snow up there in that farthest corner of the sky he 'd seen one day when Carole took him flying . It weighed about a ton but it flew , and not like a noisy airplaneeither , but absolutely silent in the sky , hunting for its mate or a younger trumpeter swan just like it . Thinking of all that bone and feathers being airborne was likep154thinking of his father driving Mooney 's car . He just wished it were so . When he put the books aside and turned out his lights , he could n't hear anything downstairs , so they must all be out in back , maybe in the studio , though he could hear Barbara messing around in the kitchen . He did n't mean to sleep just yet . He had an idea too good for that , one that would n't work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the studio and sacrifice her . The two men would tie Carole to one of the pottery wheels while his mother watched like a sparrow hawk perched on the window ledge . They 'd start her spinning and put their hands in her to shape her and make her rise like a big white jug under their molding hands . Or a little white jug  --  since , as he watched through the third-story window of his fantasy , the spinning whiteness , now fat , now slender , seemed to diminish away like something watched over his father 's shoulder in a riverview mirror . Wherever this fantasy had come from , its silly components were less significant than the unquestioned and unquestionable choice of Carole as victim . He loved her . She bothered him . He hated her . As with nearly everyone she had ever met , probably , her vulnerability was intolerable , whether it was construed to be sexual or of the heart . Therefore , let them , for him , spin her sacrificially away until she became no larger than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a boy sleeping healthily through a June night . Down in the stable studio  --  after round one of the cocktails had been consumed in the screened twilight of the porch  --  the four adults maneuvered within the social equivalents of young Lot 's dream . UnstrungMooney had expressed the wish to have " a good look " at the place he had visited only on more formal occasions before . That meant first of all a drink-in-hand ramble to the end of the orchard while Royce expounded on what this view from the bluff had been once , before it was broken and civilized by ten or a dozen houses smaller and more modern than theirs . Through the evening-darkened greenery of the apple trees theyp155saw the stable as what it was meant to be  --  a capricious and ornamentedafterthought to the sober magic of the house . Its little white towers and cupolas showed in the broken twilight like some mushroomgrowth , not so much ageless as instantaneous ( though it was seventy years old ) , the projection of every instant 's inclination not to conform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the functional double doors of aluminum and glass that Priss had wanted for the passage of outsize equipment and there turn on lights in a room where shelves of fired and unfired rotundities looked on them like layers of audience in the galleries . Priss leading  --  this floor was hers , from the plasterboard wall that set off garage space for the Morgan cars to what had once been the harness room and was more recently the office where she and Tom LeCoeur had taken refuge from students . Under an ice-blue light the kilns and wheels looked more like stage property than objects of use . " And , " President Mooney of Wellford boomed , " is some of what I see student work ? " Down from a dusty shelf he took an ugly , bisque-fired vase , the size of a football . He set his cocktail glass down to use both hands in his examination . His eyebrows lifted to say , Well , someone tried . He laughed tolerantly , and as he looked to Priss for an explanation , the well-manicured middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of the red neck of the thing . " Anyway it shows a certain aboriginal craft , " said New Yorker Win Mooney . " I 'm afraid it 's mine , " Carole said . " Is n't it mine , Priss ? But you promised you 'd bust ... " The hands that held the vase became reverential , protective , as if he were afraid Carole meant then and there to seize it and throw it into the trash . " It has the charm of looseness . It feels good to the touch , " he insisted . " Let me look , " Priss asked , but when she tried to take it from Mooney 's hand and look for initials or other identifying marks left in the clay , he would not quite let go . " I do n't think it 's yours , Carole . It would n't be on that shelf .... " " It 's mine , " Carole said , quite insistent on honesty , as if hoping ,  |p156|perha|ps  , that the tone of the evening would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shortcomings . Yet , there was a kind of touching wonder in the fact that out of the scores of undistinguished student leftovers she should have been able to pick this unidentified shape as her creation . " Not all its merits are cheaply visible , " Royce said . " Nice , " Mooney insisted . " Clumsy , " Carole repeated . " Not yours , " Priss swore . And amid these contradictions the matterwas dropped . There was plenty in the studio to distract them  --  most of all perhaps an aura of professionalism , Priss 's contribution , that ignited Mooney and set him muttering about " artists in residence " and other institutional ornaments dear to a forward-looking educationalist . With an avaricious gleam in his eye , he was responding to more than martinis . He was avidly learning how designs may be etched in slip when Barbara put her head in the door to say the meat thermometer registeredone hundred and forty and both ladies rushed to save the roast from an overcooked Midwestern fate . Royce poised to follow them . Mooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a huge , empty loft now where Lot played sometimeson rainy days , but Royce put on the lights and led the way . The spiral of wooden stairs they climbed was so narrow and turned on so short a radius that Royce had to corkscrew his spine . And it was as if the displaced spinal cord should remember a serpent'stwisting when he recalled how he had gone up these very stairs with Carole ( one Christmas vacation when he was home from Exeter ) to find their pleasure before he took her to a country club dance . Fortunately fleeting was the thought that he was bringing Mooney up here to show him not only where but how that vanished scene had been enacted . " You see , there 's nothing , " he said with a smile . Nothing much . There was a tongueless coaster wagon on the broad planks of the floor , unutterably lonely in all that space , a low table with pieces of a puzzle spilling over it , a wide , fancy windowp157that was high enough to give a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , and .. . " What on earth ? " Mooney asked , pointing upward , shaking his head at the improbable surmise . " That , " Royce said . " Oh , that . That 's a wing . " High up among the rafters hung the brown ribs and spars of a wing quite like one that hoisted the Wright brothers off the sand at Kitty Hawk . " A skeleton in the Morgan closet . Yes , you 've found it . Tom Jaffe and I started to build a glider once from some plans in Popular Mechanics . " At one time , he meant to say , boys build model airplanes and gliders just as , he meant not to say , they seduce their female playmates . And time carries those phases cleanly away , he wished to affirm . " Damn thing had bicycle wheels and the theory of launching was to discover a road steep enough to get up speed for a takeoff . I believe Tom and I meant to run it right down the bluff toward the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing , though we spent most of a winter building it . " " Carole 's told me you were great on . . . on Boy Scout things , " Mooney said , without the faintest trace of irony . He craned his neck at the never-tried airfoils , either in envy or recognition of some dream that made them closer than brothers . Whatever he may have seen , he had found the occasion , long jockeyed for , to plead openly for alliance , to strip himself figuratively like a wooer . " Ah , " he said with a whispering chuckle . " You lads were going to rush down the bluff and across the river and , God , where would you have stopped ? " There was a sudden , not quite coherent turn toward wistfulness in his voice . " It must have been wonderful to grow up here . It 's a great country . " He shook his head as if , like the land of dreams , the Midwest had suddenly swum into his ken . He said , " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York is ridiculous . You know such people too . People who ca n't understand why I 'm out here except to advance myself . " He shook his head like a sinner looking back . " I had the privilege of a childhood in filthy old Boston . The old daddy said I 'd go to Harvardp158someday  --  that 's the one justification I can remember for our living there , though there must have been other necessities  --  but it turned out to be Boston University . I despised it . " In the shadow-fringed loft his thought spurted and hissed like a fuse lit by accident . He had not made it clear what he despised  --  Boston U. , or all his past , or his old daddy . But the admission that he had ever had a parent came strangely from him  --  seeming , as he always had , to have issued full-grown from the times , like a dapper Zeitgeist . He laughed and said with disturbingly naked  --  even aggressive  --  humility , " I would have despised Harvard just as much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head apologetically as if he understood as well as Royce how much his thought was outrunning his explanation of it . " For mine . For Wellford . You have n't seen  --  you would n't believe how strongly I feel about what education has got to be . It 's been so wrong , so wrong . For generations , perhaps , warping youth , frustrating youth , eroding their capacity for ... " For ? The answer , the object , seemed to be suspended in the silence just beyond the end of a breath . For ? For ? He did not trust himself to say what for , as if to name the glory would be to profane it . Nor could Royce in any circumstances have brought himself to ask the word , not even ask by a glance , since he was simply afraid to look at the face from which the inspired voice issued , for fear of seeing a fraudulent grimace . In what was passing for pure confession it would have been too unkind to search for the note of falsity . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be better to believe that the well-guarded heart was pure . Mooney took a drink and a breath and said , " It could change life ! I 'm a disciple of Whitman and the Greeks . I believe in the swarmingmultitudes within the mind of each person . . . Ah , it 's so hard to find anyone one even dares say that to . You might well laugh , too . " " No . " " No . You would n't . I believe you can understand it 's not a pretensewith me . You know  --  you with your sharp eye  --  how I 'll trick and scheme and dye my hair to get it . Oh , I do that , too . " The wordsp159came like a scalding stream from pained lips . How doubt their utter honesty ? If there was still a doubt let it be removed thus : " Even tolerate you here . If one thing was clear to me from the minute I came , Royce , it was that I 'd never be secure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Hand is n't the only one who advised me to move you along . You 've made me very nervous . " Royce shook his head in the not-yet-committed gesture of one who ca n't believe what he is hearing . Mooney took his sleeve and shook his arm . " Listen , you 're the only man in Buchanan who frightens me . Not by your name . Not by your connections . Not even by your intelligence . It 's your character . I believe you 're a giant , Royce . Your character and your patience . You sit and listen and watch . And you take us all in , and then  --  pfft !  --  you have us all . Right where you want us . " " I wo n't claim to understand the mechanism you 're attributing to me , " Royce said , not so much reluctant to hear this crescendoing appeal out to its end as wishing he could hear it in the open air . The loft had become oppressive , as if Mooney 's passion had exhausted the oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it superficiallyamounted to  --  it needed space around it if it was not to be altogether morbid . Lightly he said , " I understand that patience may seem aggressive . Priss has schooled me in that notion . " " I 'm not blaming you , " Mooney said hoarsely . " No , no , no . Let me get back to the point . I 'm playing for everything here at Wellford . I want a great university . " He let the word ring , suddenly dampened it , rushed on . " I want to build something that will last a thousand years . " In that year so soon after the war , references to millennial durationstill automatically produced associations with the Third Reich . But Mooney sailed right over that hurdle . He knew his giant well enough to know him incapable of easy analogies . " You see what I mean , " he said in a kind of ecstasy . " I can boom it . But you can make it . . . " He paused on an indrawn breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his mind too cunning to use it now.  |p160But  in the strange , oppressive isolation Royce heard the word , felt the discharge of passion soiling him like the pollution of a dream he was incapable of halting . He took a deep , tired , smiling breath . " I 'm moved by what you 've said . I do n't quite understand what you want of me . " " Your soul , " Mooney said in his bland hysteria . " Your soul for the university . Do n't sell me out . Use me as I intend to use you . Get off your horse , Morgan . Come on the road with me . I 'll raise the moola . " He made a coarse , self-deriding gesture of shilling for money . " You bring the men . The spirit . The young . The faculty . Do n't say no , Morgan . The chance will never bring two people like us together again . " " I have n't meant to sell you out . . . " Royce said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutely for the twisted stair that would get them out of here . The rest of that evening was Mooney 's triumph , and it was not so much the triumph of his sincerity in the stable loft ( that he had been sincere was beyond Royce 's ability to doubt ) as the triumphant exploitation of advantages that his brief sincerity had won . There had been no hypocrisy in his flattery . No matter . He used it as if it had been pure hypocrisy . He had found the note and the moment to stalemate Royce at the same time he incited the ladies . Through dinner he went ecstatically on developing his vision of the University-to-be as he could not have told it elsewhere . It took , perhaps , the sum of Carole 's charity and Royce 's formalizing sympathyand Priss 's sibyl cunning to make a pyramid out of the chunks he had to deliver . Something had happened . He had a prospect , and he thought it a firm one , of adding a school of metallurgy onto the existing liberal arts structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Oscar Nadige said he was willing ) to give them a building and pay staff salaries for a minimum of ten years , the return to be the training of engineers for the parent company . " Let 's see the color of their money , ' our friend Worth demands , " he said with a thrill of defiance in his voice.  | " Henry 's skeptical ? " Royce guessed . " Henry 's worse than skeptical . He 's becoming destructive and negative . There 's no worse millstone around our neck than Henry Worth . Perhaps it 's fundamentally pure jealousy  --  I understand his type  --  in that he 's done nothing at all since his war profiteering but sit on his money and expect it to hatch . " This assessment did not depend for its force on its accuracy . Mooney was in full swing away from reliance on Henry , and the next step would be some scheme to pack the trustees and get Henry out of the way altogether . Which could be the motive for this evening 's courtship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his good will required for more than a balance of power in a showdown with Henry . If they took on a metallurgical school  --  and if it thrived as one would hope  --  could it in any real sense be fitted into a unified educationalprogram here ? Would it be a bump on the log , an essentiallydistinct enterprise ? Royce found that a serious answer was being solicited from him . And yet , when he tried to give it , he found Mooney beaming on him , approving not so much the sense of the analysis he made as finding it " high-priced , " sounding well tailored , a magnificent label to put on the goods . He saw himself photographed as a man of distinctionendorsing a blend of Virginia tobacco and Kentucky horse shit . No matter . No matter tonight . The color of the Nadige money had not yet been seen . This was a matter that would be settled within the next two or three years . What did matter was the height of ambition looming like a mountain peak when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ( or these four , assuming that Mooney 's own astounded ears had never heard such visions come out of his mouth ) were the first to know the full scope of his wishes . And , in the grip of the creative moment , it mattered very little whether he had been plotting something like this all his life or was making it up on the spur of the Nadige oiler . Mooney was forty-one . ( None of the others knew that for sure ;  |p162by  a process of military intelligence Priss knew that his age was betweenthirty-nine and forty-two , that his birthday was the Fourth of July . ) But that evening he showed himself ageless . He spoke as boy and as sage  --  pubescent , senile , ripe , naive , clairvoyant , and heroically blind . How his jeweled eyes glittered over the red roast and the Junegreenpeas as he compared " a base of twenty-five hundred students , " soon to be attained at Wellford , with a kind of bridgehead from which his educational forces could march , countermarch , hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " older places " ( Harvard ? Yale ? Princeton ? Chicago ? Stanford ? The Big Ten ? ) carried around their hoary necks . He spread his little hands like a victorious fighter pilot in a newsreelwhen he told how he and George Hand had just mortgaged last year 's real estate acquisition for twenty-five thousand more than the purchase price . " I got away with that , " he said with owlish , droll self-astonishment , permitting himself now a tremor of awe , if not fear , like the acrobat 's apprentice who has not even dared notice the space beneathuntil he is off the wire . " Royce hoisted you over , " Priss said  --  not so much claiming credit for her husband in his practical services as directing the point at Mooney 's vanity , and speaking with the privilege of a very close friend . He had not known . It was news to him that Consolo , for the merchants , had ever come asking Royce , What shall we do ? But he took it now with absolutely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had known exactly  --  what he could count on Royce to do for him . And it shocked Royce to see himself so predictable to this man . " Well , hand in hand , " Mooney joked . " The way I 'd like to play it I 'll always need people better than I to fill in the gaps for me , catch me when I wobble , tell me off when I 'm wrong . The truth is . . . " and it seemed to stun him touchingly to perceive it so clearly , " ... the truth is I have n't much to contribute except ... " He dared not  --  not quite  --  say vision , so he shrugged the word away unspoken , to let them call his function whatever they wanted . " At any rate ,  |p163now  that we 're here , you can see what 's next , " he said in his imperativehalf-whisper . " Well , not to pay debts , " Priss said drolly and Mooney whooped with laughter and wiped his eyes . " Debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . We 're going to build a fieldhouse . " His lifted eyes and rising hands described the dimensions he had in mind  --  as if he were watching a vision of two zeppelins and a whale joggling around loosely under a two-acre fieldhouse ceiling . " Tommy Barker 's going to build our fieldhouse , " he said . And that was a foregone conclusion . He dismissed that step , too , as an already certain element of the base  --  like the infantry of twenty-five hundred students who would shortly be on hand . " Barker 's very good , I suppose . . . . " Priss , skeptical , was not so much trying to puncture the skin of the vision as tease out an amplification . Mooney sighed like a lover already soundly affianced . " Tommy 's very good , " he said . " And will beget our fieldhouse , and the fieldhousewill beget a library and a library will beget gifts and endowmentsof the aged , the gifts will beget and beget and beget . " Royce laughed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Royce Morgan will beget the university that people like me are too busy with externals to beget ourselves , " he said . He was not looking at Carole when he said this , but Priss was and she saw the unsuppressible blush rise and fall and rise again on Carole 's neck as she caught the sense of Mooney 's proposal . Oh , they all gathered that in essence Mooney was proposing a brotherly sharing of the throne , with himself in the lesser role of gobetween , mouthpiece , fall guy , and figurehead . And Royce , prepared by that reckless wooing in the stable loft , knew all at once that he believed Mooney would stick by what he proposed . He would stick by it for good reasons and bad ; he would not even be constant from one month to another in respecting his own bargain . But like a profligate husband who returns to his lawful wife as automatically as he chases every passing skirt , he would inp164the long run be loyal out of compulsion . It was simply this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the exercise of power . He could not himself conceive what this might be , so he had to ally , as if with a blood oath , to the man who was supposed to know the end . In this case , with Royce . If there was treachery in the offer , it was not Mooney 's . He was  --  faithful merchant of souls  --  trying to buy " the best , " whatever his cunning told him was the best available . If the pig he sold from his unexamined poke turned out not to be the best , if it turned out to be nothing at all , the responsibility for that fraud would not be Mooney 's . So it appeared to the mind behind the face behind the cigar smoke . Only , Royce thought , puffing his good cigar in the candlelight and trying to detach himself enough to see all four of them as they were composed in a group so he could remember the picture of this trade in years to come  --  only , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the women , one or both . In his big pitch he offers what they want in exchange for my hypothetical soul . So when he did recall that evening in the years afterward , seeing four people making a monstrous bargain , he saw the one who might have been himself  --  the skin that might have been the poke for a soul worth their dickering  --  emptied by the very fact that it was bargainedfor and yielded . He would never suppose that he was sold to Mooney by the women . He was sold by the failure to imagine before Mooney had what the women might want most from him  --  sold , in a word , by the impotence he had brought from Saipan . " We can hope , " Mooney said exultantly ( when to hope was to set the perfect snare for hope ) . On the spur of the moment , or spurred on by the moment of opportunity , he named the things they could hope to make of their Wellford , Buchanan lives . And it sounded wonderful . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discerning how the other man might be bound to him ( for the mute configuration of circumstances had made that possibility ) but in giving it the human sound of hope , giving an affirmative voice to amoral possibility , sop165it could become their purpose and therefore their responsibility , like a choice . From a base of twenty-five hundred students ( spear-carrying lambs from Nowhere , ready to march on Cloudland and colonize it ) the crusade could distance all pursuers . Mooney would drive the chariot . Royce would sit up high . The ladies ... would n't they adore the speed and the conquest , knowing it was all for the good ? Yes they could , so they would . And as the future was being mined with explosives , it sounded better than ever . There was Mooney 's genius . Later the four of them lounged on the screened porch again in the chintz-covered gliders . There were no lights except those that came from the street , gathering starry green reflections from intervening maple leaves or dewy hedge tops , and the slant mellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house . What would seem so strange later  --  as it would have seemed unlikelyat any time before this evening  --  was their intimacy . For all the propriety of their language , they seemed to loll in a kind of lewd linkage , like perverts in a daisy chain or ( the more ancient image ) like a knot of vipers tangled for hibernation in hell 's own climate . Of course the hospitality of the Morgan house and Morgan booze had made their contributions , but the catalyzing force was surely Mooney 's presidential gift for putting folks at ease . He had tripped them with his humility in respect to Royce 's future . He did more . Among intimates he volunteered a winning confession of the bumbling behind the Miss Halstead affair . He confessed his extreme embarrassment at " botching things up " for her back on the day when he took his place with the cake-eaters in the library stacks . " You made a legend , " Priss said . " Oh , no . Oh , no ! " he disclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chortling breath  --  " I 'd never been a college president before . I acted like a smart-aleck boy . It was an absurd thing to do , and afterward I was frankly too paralyzed with embarrassment to stop the wheelsp166that had been set in motion . That was left to Royce . " ( Who recalled that he had been able to stop nothing , that the juggernaut had rolled on and on . ) " Poor old lady . Ca n't we call her back , Royce ? " He was seen to wipe his eyes , but since he had been laughing all the while he spoke , the reason for his tears was beyond determining . Nevertheless he had not lamented Miss Halstead in vain . Carole heard the note of self-abasement . Carole saw . Carole would make the most charitable interpretation possible , and not merely because she was high on martinis , hospitality , and the flattery of Royce . Each of them , in the spell of the evening , was made to feel that as of now old attitudes were impertinent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks and showing himself , after all , as human as anyone , it began not to matter what Priss had intended for Carole or Carole had intended to do on her own or what forebodingsRoyce had entertained about her and Mooney . It was as if all their past intentions and even their schemes had only been guesses at a process that took its own surprising turns in spite of them . So here and now Carole would respond to a candor and fundamentalgenerosity Mooney had never been able to expose before . She was being won there , under Royce 's very eyes as it were , and not because anyone had intended it that way  --  but because it had to happen . While Mooney 's voice played its facile tunes , there fell away one by one the obstacles to her yielding faithfully . Her splendid , creamy shoulders between the blue straps of her dress trembled with laughterat his jokes and slumped in submission at his ecstatic hopes . And from humility he bounced like a wrestler coming off the ropes to a dazzling ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started again on what he had tried to tell Royce in the stable loft . This time he brought it to its point . What were they really talking about ? What were they giving their lives to a college for ? What was education for ? " For love , " he said in an unstrained , perfectly simple voice . Then ducking , even yet fearing to be misunderstood ( he had not been ) , he immediately tried the pedant 's trick of explaining away his clearestcommunication . " That is , the liberation of the individual in thep167Greek sense , unbinding the natural self so the libidinal flow will be ... natural . Hell , education is n't to make people complex . It 's to allow them , in a complex world , to be simple . " " Yes , " Royce assented , as though he had been asked . The voice he heard , if not the man before him , had spoken what he had tried hardest in his life to believe . He would not be reticent when he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assent , and of course applied it to her own interpretation of what was being said . " The erotic college , " Priss joked , to keep the moment nimble . Mooney landed acrobatically on his feet before this mockery . " I 'm not proposing to incorporate the Coolidge Motels into the curriculum , " he cracked . " No , but . . . " Carole said . " No , but ... " She wanted to agree with what had sounded so good , so noble . In spirit she would agree , though she could not match the others in their nimbleness of expression . She would assent once again to what promised to be better than life . Her hand rested on Mooney 's sleeve to tell him , Yes , she agreed . When they left the house toward midnight , Priss and Royce stood at the screen door watching them fade down the glooms and shadows of the walk , then saw them pause awhile before they got into the swanboat of a car that waited to carry them off . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the walk , but as if she knew he must be , Priss said all at once with a terrified shiver , " Royce , what have I done to you ? " She had done nothing . Her loose-built schemes and all the refined envy of a woman with time on her hands ended where they had begun , in her imagination . They were surely without direct influence on what was still to happen that night between white-haired Mooney and Carole . But she must act as if it were all her doing and hurry her man , her male , her stallion upstairs to their own bed to make up to him what he was denied in the loss of Carole , to drive deeper into him the barb planted by her conspiracy in that loss . She must open her body to him like an undefended fruit , split forp168his pleasure and oblivion . Close like a jaw . Accept like a sinner pummeled and trodden into the mud . Demand like a devil . Writhe in her gratifying torment . Cut like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour on their bed  --  too warm for even the covering of a sheet  --  she fought him for some meaningful part in what was happening in spite of her . She led him by the ears to the sewer of her self-disgust . She crouched her whole body like a nude slave at the base of his towering manhood and tongued her adoration , her submission . She broke in the fervor of orgasm , recomposed like an image recomposing on the surface of disturbed water , and took his seed like a vampire . He tried , as always , to let her find what she wanted  --  speech where there was only brutal silence , answers where there could be nothing but sensation and fantasy . Ah , he was a lover , and if bodies could , his ought to have quieted hers . But for the hour of their passion he was buttoned , like the men buttoned within the armor of a tank , inside the hermitage of his thoughts . And there Priss 's question  --  What have I done to you ?  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to accept the evening at face value . If not all of Mooney 's promises seemed solid gold , the armistice they represented was some cause for rejoicing . The promise of a new beginning had been there . He had heard it , had said his own yes to it . But after Priss 's question all the complacencies stacked up as the evening went on seemed to have been stacked on purpose to be collapsed in one ominous clatter . In the uproar of second thoughts ( dinning while the bed bounced , like the shrilling of springs in some second-rate brothel ) the girl who had walked off his lawn with Mooney was progressively transformed from the family friend , the widow of thirty-three , and the selfappointedaunt of his son , once again into the preadolescent beauty , orphan , and playmate he had almost eclipsed from his thoughts . She was a child who needed his protection from her own faithfulness , who had asked for the cue to say no and die instead of the cue to say yes and be torn apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . .  |p169He  should have prevented it . That was the given task of his manhood , not this sensual , physical pronging . In knowing that he knew that the very act of mounting his wife ( yes , even of here getting her with child , as it would turn out he had ) was the sign of his impotence . Which Priss knew too . And she was cheated by this insidious knowledge . So that nothing came of her attempt at magic but that she got pregnant . It was one of the ironies of planned parenthood that Sherman Blackburn Morgan should have been conceived out of his mother 's decision to assert her magical control of the world . At a quarter of two they were finished . Royce Morgan had not satisfied his wife . His wet body lay harboring an image of Carole as a female Benjamin , the last born . The child now delivered by his virtuous silence and his impotence into Babylon .. . From these appalling contradictions he retired promptly to sleep . And woke , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saturating the curtains , to find Priss fully clothed in a gray dress standing beside the bed sober and alert as if she were ready to go out . She had already been out . " Well , " she said . " Well , now we know . At least I do and you 're about to , whether you want to or not . He stayed all night at Carole 's . Imagine , he 's parked that dumb car in her garage and closed the door . I had to go in the side to make sure it was there . " " That was brave of him , " Royce said groggily . The color of the morning sun sticking over the horizon reminded him of the unfired vase in the studio where Mooney 's finger had played . He sat up and blinked in fright . " It 's a very recognizable car , " Priss said , as if fornication were an exact science and the comprehension of it a detached mental discipline . Royce 's face showed nothing . " I guess this indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education , " he said lazily . " It indicates what lengths I 'll go to , " Priss said . " I wo n't let us just be used . I intend to do some using myself . "  | " For instance ? " She shook her head in angry bafflement . " For instance calling a photographer from the Courier-Sentinel to picture Mooney backing his car out of the garage of a well-known Buchanan lady ? " " Oh , not that . " Her notions of revenge remained metaphysical . " I do not see any practical exploitation of your discovery , Dr. Morgan , " Royce said . " Tennis anyone ? It 's a lovely day . Let us seize it . " " Not that , but there must be something to do . It means some-thing . " He nodded and headed for the shower , where he heard Lot tinkeringwith the taps . " Be my wife and help me understand , " he said . She shook her head . Her spying trip had been a last clutch for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had teeth and claws to use in making a life . She was not in control , but she did have teeth and claws . She would use them here , on him , in default of the good chance to use them on her avowed enemies . " Fun 's fun and let them have it , " she said with blithe bitterness . " I guess this does mean they 'll marry , does n't it ? It appears to be in addition to good reasons already noted . " He nodded a slow agreement . " I 've been wrong about that , too . I did n't think they would . Yes . I suppose they 'll marry soon . It is n't in Mooney to waste his effort for anything less . I guess it will be soon , " he said , " since last night indicated that Mooney needs more than Tommy Barker after all . Since even he knows there has to be an end in view for all he 's able to pull off . "  |p171THOMAS  BARKER , All-American forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same Tommy Barker who before the war had mowed the big lawn for Royce 's aunts . The physical capacity and Hoosier single-mindedness of the basketball star had no doubt always been there in potential . Surely the environment of Wellford in its booming years ( not to mention the contagion of big thinking caught from proximity to President Mooney , the front seat of an imperial car being perhaps the best place to observe the secrets of the rear seat ) added something definable as the habit of success to the young man 's native endowments . After the war he traveled with a different entourage than that which used to come out of Bronkley with him . His mowing labors for the Blackburn ladies were chiefly memorableto Royce because his whole family came with him to the job . An ancient blue Essex would swing up the gravel drive on a hot afternoon of those years . From the rear seat , where he had ridden beside his lawn mower , Tommy would get out first , a wiry elevenyear-oldwith close-set eyes . After him , his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coveralls descended . The father would kneel with Tommy beside the mower , upended on one wheel , while they oiled it and tested the blades with the amateur cunning of country mechanics preparing a Model A for a vacation jaunt across the plains to the mythic Rockies or Yellowstone National Park . The two little girls in faded blue held hands and covetously stared at the house , while already the fat brother had found shade to lie in . A perfectly constant smile ofp172servility and contempt covered his face like something applied for comfort  --  like a damp handkerchief , perhaps , laid on to keep the gnats away . By the time young Tommy had made his first mowing circuit of the big lawn , a second car would have appeared . This was a Buick touring car , one of those rolling clipper ships that saw their best days and greatest popularity while Buchanan sportsmen were learning to gamble on the national stock market . It was the kind of car that might once have carried the gangster Datento 's girls or his little packagesof painkiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to St. Louis , Sardis , or Cairo on moonlight nights . It was the right chariot for a criminal folk hero , but its depraved rakishness was long gone over into plain decrepitude before the Barker clan got it . Its already aging home paint job covered pits in the original finish visible from the porch when it was parked by the stable . Bolted-on patches of galvanized tin held the outline of the high fenders intact and covered , on the body , what might have been bullet holes put in by some state policeman long since raised to an office job in the capital . The Buick brought the rest of Tommy 's family . These were mostly female , but included two brothers-in-law whose bare arms and round faces showed the caponized sleekness of professional reliefers . The Barker ladies always brought refreshments , and they dispensed them under the big top of the Buick while they watched Tommy earn his dollar ten . The going rate for lawns in Buchanan was two bits in those times . The Blackburn lawn had been computed to be four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Royce 's aunts added a dime to the fee to show who they were . On and on through those primeval afternoons , the lawn mower whirred its chiselly sound as Tommy worked from a vast periphery down to a little green island , square as a sheaf of banknotes , to be obliterated with one last burst of steam and a ceremonial showing of his clenched teeth . As each section of the lawn was finished there would be a moment  --  and no more  --  of suburban silence . Once he got going Tommy never stopped except between the sec/tions divided by flower beds and brick walks . A section finished , he knelt again with his father to test the blade edges with a dirty thumb and shoot drops of oil , darker than opals , into the muck around gears and bearings . The pauses were so uniform and brief that it must seem to a watcher that Tommy never really changed his pace after the first grass began to shower up over his knees and fall around his sneakers . And perhaps it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boyhood , so contrary to Tom Sawyer 's style  --  that the Barkers came to marvel at , finding it ( as Royce had , too ) not merely heroic , not merely a laudable show of strength , but a kind of satyr play , prophetic of some tragedy and tragic immolationto come , a dance of boy and machine whose meaning would be fully spelled out only by time . When Tommy reversed his mower and pushed it ( singing its steely song ) from the south sections of the lawn to the north ones , the spectators from the Buick trooped shyly after him , carrying sandwiches and lemonade and stationing themselves at the fringe of the orchard to see the last acts performed . Probably from time to time one of the attendant female Barkers offered Tommy drink from a fruit jar full of lukewarm lemonade , and probably from time to time on the hottest days he interrupted his task to bathe arms and neck from the garden hose as the nontoiling brothers-in-law so frequently did . But memory preserved the pure relationship of ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not remember Tommy 's ever having accepted relief . He was the artist and prophet of the clan , and he mowed a lawn they could not even imagine without his dedication . At least his family never helped with the primary function of cutting the grass . They did , however , serve him somewhat like the cuadrilla and the entourage of a matador . They ran ahead of his mower to gather whatever obstacles had been left in his path by the slothful owners of the property  --  hoses and sprinklers , lawn chairs , magazines , lemonade glasses , and little wrought-iron tables , and all the detritus of bourgeois self-indulgence . All these were tossed helter-skelter on the porch so that , after Tommy 's mowing , the porchp174seemed to have been covered by flood water that had drowned the civilization for which it was made . It was the duty  --  at least the invariable accomplishment  --  of Tommy 's attendants to so terrorize Royce 's aunts and their guests that they would keep out of Tommy 's road . The poor ladies always kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not literally lock their doors against the threat of a noyade , they peered out from around their curtains with the air of maidens in a village taken by bandits . The two little girls in coveralls used to sneak onto the porches sometimes and peer in at one or another of the screen doors until some bawling voice would hail them back to the lemonade jar . One day they crept up a slanting drainspout to peer in a bathroom windowwhere Royce 's Aunt Linda had gone to pee . She squawked . They fell ten feet into a flower bed  --  and in a few minutes could be heard whispering like delicate rodents at the front screen door . But probably the main motive that brought the Barker family was that of simple awe , and they came as so many sports fans would come later to the old and new Wellford fieldhouses and the arenas of the Midwest and the nation , to pay tribute to a folk hero whose charisma was as undeniable as it was crude . " There is something about that boy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay him more than a dollar ten . " At a dollar ten per blade of grass they could hardly have paid enough for the revelation , and at any price they could not have afforded to understand what Tommy the Mower prefigured . And Royce , visitingin a summer holiday , had warned idly , " If you did , you 'd have all of Bronkley up here to watch him . There 's a real likelihood that no other male Barker ever earned a dollar ten on any one given day of his life . They 're probably up here trying to figure how he does it so they can . " " He seems to be in training for something , " Mildred Blackburn guessed shrewdly . Mooney was the first to recognize what the boy had been training for , the first to suppose that in partnership with him this bony youthp175might become the greatest normal-sized white basketball player to emerge on the North American continent . Tommy had had offers of athletic scholarships from several schools bigger and richer than Wellford . No one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeuring apprenticeship , probablyno other school could have offered him enough . When Dolly Dowling and the supporting team that Dolly hired came on the scene in Tommy 's junior year , when the star became part of a machinery designed not only around him but for him  --  as it were within him ( or within whatever humanoid , name-bearing , photogenic , high-leaping , from-sports-page-smiling , at-pep-rally-predicting , in-private-vanishing thing was reified by the star-making system of Mooney 's devising , anyway )  --  he ( it ) could probably not have been transferred to another setting without finding that not only his coach had turned into a pumpkin and his horses to mice but he himself had been transformed back into a prepubescent laborer destined for no employment nobler than pushing a lawn mower on the college green to earn his tuition by unsporting sweat . The star was made , not born , or ripened or refined , either  --  though everyone must admit that not just anyone would have served as raw material . ( That was where the heart would stick , the stomach twitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been a boy . Not a good boy , not a blameless boy . ) To his own charge must be laid the fact that somewhere , sometime , irrespective of what was done with him , he must have understood how , out of all the multitudes of the earth , he had found in Mooney his proper partner . Those blank , badger eyes of the Bronkley boy must have glimpsed shrewdly that Wellford  --  never heard of before in the Big Story of American sports  --  was the Valley of Elah where little David could wind up his sling most picturesquely to let fly at any and all Goliaths . With two little Davids  --  one to throw sand in the giant 's eyes while the other aimed his rock . . . Yes , Tommy had decided on his own responsibility that he could not do better elsewhere . And yet it was Tommy , too , who would at last put out his boyish hand to derail and confute the career made of , for , and by him ,  |p176gro|ping  as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say " I " from inside a system that had identified him only as Number One . Before that criminal restoration  --  not so much inevitable as merely understandable after the event  --  Tommy Barker had served more truly than Royce Morgan as Mooney 's partner in making Wellford College into a university . Before his Icarian tumble , Tommy 's brilliant flight and all the opportunities for parlay that it presented to partner Mooney succeeded in delaying the marriage of Mooney to the widowed girlchildCarole . Those were great , revolutionary years at Wellford . Mooney was too busy to marry . As everyone could see  --  each from a different perspective ( and the lady from hers , not often flat aback with knees spread for the presidential pleasure and convenience , but often enough to keep the right alive , yes , and the normal expectation , too )  --  too busy . What Priss 's spying had satisfied her of was still taken , as firmly as it could be , for granted in Buchanan for the next two years . The certainty blew warm . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the Rolls-Royce ensconced on a May morning in the ample Prentice garage detected in the air some signs of an imminent marriage . It came to be expected that where Mooney appeared informally ( excepting athletic events and student functions , where his appearance was in line of duty ) his little lamb Carole would be sure to appear as well . And that they should be thought of as a couple was enough to put a sort of picture frame around them that in time became a sort of pen . What drift had brought together , no one thought of putting asunder . Nor did anyone , probably , say that Mooney was too busy  --  too much married to Tommy Barker 's career  --  to get around to marryingCarole . They simply saw that this was so . The seminal fact in Wellford 's transformation into a university was Tommy Barker 's play . Nadige of Racine had indeed shown thep177color of its money . The possibility of a metallurgical school had about the same status as Mooney 's marriage  --  it looked as if it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked green , prohibitive conditions put off the decision to go ahead . Henry Worth had long since forgotten his reasons for opposing the addition . He went on resenting it like a personal affront . But in the meantime , the offer from Nadige had been dangled under the noses of a dozen other Midwest companies ( somewhat as Mme. Magda Farona had been dangled before the eyes of Buchanan womanhood ) and they were twitching to show their money of the same fragrant shade . As Royce could see better than most , prospects of Wellford 's big future hung in the air like a thunderstorm , only waiting to be precipitated . He did what he could to foresee its shape and prepare for it  --  Noah laying on the planking and whistling the animals up as he glances over his shoulder at the sky . Like Noah , he humbly disclaimedany powers to bring or prevent the deluge . Tommy Barker made it happen . But Mooney 's was the veterinarian'sand the midwife 's hand , dribbler of the seminal juices , receptorof the newborn squalling thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 195os  --  Wellford University . As personal manager of the Barker cult , apologist for the means that would be justified by an end nobody asked to be shown , guarantor that a soul would be grafted onto the newborn " as soon " as its life and survival were assured , Mooney was too evidently in the middle of his maneuver to be interrupted by marriage or any other claim for an accounting . In terms of practice Royce accepted that as calmly as anyone else . Sold to his bargain , he kept his end of it well . And he kept it practicallyisolated from the flux of symptoms he could not help noting while the cycle of gestation ran its course . One remote checkpoint on the cycle was his contact with the students . Among them was a little couple named Burke , who lived in an apartment between his house and the college . From time to time , especially in the cold months , he picked them up and gave them a lift to school.  |p178Burke  was a veteran of the ETO . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any spark of furor over sports . Week by week in the first year of Barker 's glory Royce watched the husbandsurrender his skepticism about " all this . " The susceptible little woman was winning . Young Burke began to opine solemnly that " Wellford owed an unpayable debt " to Barker for having put it on the map . " We 've got national visibility now , " he said once , confident that he meant something with those words ( which might have come down to him indirectly from the horse 's mouth ; they had a Mooney ring ) . " Basketball in itself is n't so important , " said the spiritually wizened young man , " but there 's a lot of alumnae and townspeople who are going to rally and support the college who would have been indifferent before . " " Each one of them will say that basketball is n't important to him but that it 's a good thing for interesting others in the college , " Royce said . " What ? " Not even little Burke , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him seriously when he was most serious , most himself . Burke went on , " Basketball will bring in money . It does n't matter where the money comes from , and if Barker makes a better school of Wellford , I say more power to him . " As if a student ought to concern himself with such things ! Surely expediency , finance , was the administration 's worry . It was Mooney 's , Royce 's , and George Hand 's . Surely the point of having a president is to divide labor so that not everyone will have to put on the heavy burdens of authority and compromise . But  --  just as surely  --  it was Mooney 's accomplishment and perhaps the key of his success to make the whole institution think like a president . Presently , having corrupted her husband into athletic enthusiasm , Mrs. Burke showed herself sounder than he was . Finally , when Wellfordlost the national tournament in Barker 's senior year , Royce found with dismay that both of them were suddenly stone cold toward the team , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is n't as if the team represented us , " Mrs. Burke said with a startling gravity . Ah  --  if she had only said this a week before , whenp179most sports writers favored Wellford over victorious N.Y.U. ! She was n't really turning her coat , Royce thought , nor being a fairweatherenthusiast ; she was just , alas , unlucky in declaring herself only when circumstances made it ugly and easy to do so . She said , " Everyone knows they 're a bunch of mercenaries and they 're not taking real courses . " Royce said gently , " That 's not quite correct . I 've had to review their eligibility personally . " He knew what they were paid . He had not yet heard  --  nor had anyone else in Buchanan  --  the full story of where three of Tommy 's new teammates had used up their eligibility in former college play . He still thought then that Wellford had observed the letter of the law . Young Burke nudged his wife , a signal not to disagree with Authority , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be quieted . " Well , Dean Morgan , " she went on , " whether or not there 's any outright crookedness , everybody knows the team is n't , are n't legitimatestudents . " " You do n't have any evidence of that , " her husband said with the judiciousness of resignation . She looked at both the men , almost in fright , as if they had entrappedher . " Evidence ! " she said . " How would I have evidence ? " Her knowledge was of another kind , meaningless in public affairs , painful to clutch in her privacy . " Then you do n't know what you 're saying , " her husband scoffed  --  not unkindly , really , but as if to let her off easily . She did not want to be left off . She pushed her little flaming face around the bulk of Royce 's arm and said , " Me ! I 'm not the greatest intellectual , and I suppose you might chuckle about my opinions . All I know is I never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on George 's GI entitlement , and I 'm going to have a baby , and that 's all too damned hard unless you can believe an education is truly , truly worth it . " " Are n't you confusing . . . ? " Royce began patiently . And after the chitchat of comforting her was through and he had let them out at their destination on the campus he had to answer to himself that ,  |p180Yes  , somehow there had been a confusion of the means by which Mooney was securing his base with what should have been the purely private intercourse between each student and his books . Impossibleto understand quite how the athletic destiny got so messily involved with humanities and sciences , but there it was  --  in everyone'smind an unsortable tangle . He had never supposed it to be essential to the bargain that the disciplines of the classroom or of the library could be kept absolutely distinct from the artificial fervor over sport and its commercial accompaniments . Neither the single mind nor the minds of Wellford 's thousands were so hermetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from another . But until the thing had happened , had gone its full cycle and revealed its own concrete and specific terms , he had no better language than anyone else for comprehendingwhat it meant . A faculty protege of his , a sociologist named Wallace Emree , started a major project of investigating the Tommy Barker phase of Wellford . Cannily he set the machinery of his discipline to work in an attempt to measure from within , as it were , the shifting tides . He interviewed hundreds over a period of two and a half years  --  students , faculty , and townspeople . He tabulated athletic receiptsand , as well as he was able , correlated them with the expandingCollege budget . He charted and graphed and had not begun to finish the mammoth work by the time Tommy blew it all apart . Maybe he was making a language that would define the reality . All in good humor he and Royce used to go over his latest findings and attempt to articulate their meaning . But for all of that it seemed they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale and saying that  --  after pep meetings on some snowy afternoon , with the band blowing heartily among the snow-bent campus pines , the " porn-porn girls " cartwheeling madly between the students and the team on the steps of Arden Hall , Tommy up there frowning like a boy potentate amid his entourage of six-foot-six recruits  --  when Mooney and Dowling with Tommyp181between them drove away in the gray Rolls-Royce , the impatient heart of the College sent the adventurers to bring back  --  literallytheGolden Fleece . Given such expectations , there had to be a day of reckoning . Hearts that had expected the impossible could not be satisfied that all this basket-shooting and showmanship would produce at length would be a towering fieldhouse . Which , as a matter of fact , was built on Mooney 's schedule , ready for use during Tommy 's senior year . With the same eyes that saw Mooney 's promises to him and to the College coming true , Royce Morgan watched the Barker cycle . Later he would remember that for all his foreknowledge of how it must turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with constant surprise . For instance there was the night that Mooney collected trustees and College wheel horses in the mansion to announce that ground was to be broken for the fieldhouse . Since everyone knew in advancewhy he came , the surprise lay elsewhere . Smiling , Mooney said , " There is one bit of additional information which I 'm privilegedto give you tonight that I 'm sure will be more than cordially welcomed by all of you . The Board of Trustees this very last Saturdayvoted unanimously to call the new building the Harvey P. Morgan Memorial Fieldhouse in reverent memory of that President Morgan who contributed so much to forming the spirit of Wellford . " There was polite clapping . There was Henry Worth 's sardonic , good-humored stare leveled on Royce and Priss , measuring them with a practical man 's curiosity about how they were taking this loaded tribute . " I think , " Mooney went on , " that not even Dean Morgan was aware that the Board had this under contemplation . Were you , Royce ? " Royce shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor of the mansion , at the great , ham-colored face of his father 's portrait , finding for the first time ever some expression in the painted blue eyes , round as tulip bulbs beneath the white handlebars of the oldp182man 's brows . The painted eyes said , My God , boy , now I 'm really done for ; now I 'm really gone . His serene death now seemed like a bit of treachery that left him defenseless against something he might have enjoyed as a joke , but which was no joke at all . To have named a chapel , a library , a classroombuilding , or even a dormitory after him would have been no violation . A fieldhouse full of hired athletes was rather another matter . " We 've had considerable colloquy with the architects who designed our building for us , " Mooney said . " It has been worked out that the entrance lobby shall contain a large wall facing the doors . And on that wall I have proposed that we hang in perpetuity this grand old portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square yards of canvas behind his shoulder . And Royce thought that the painted lips tried to speak then , and he took the sense of their complaint to be the exact words of old Hamlet telling his son about that poison in his ear . In the full tide of his eloquence , Mooney went on , " I 'll miss that old man 's wise countenance questioning me as I pass through this room . Like Socrates ' demon , President Morgan has never told me what to do but only what I must not do when I 've looked to him for guidance . And if I 've been able to avoid some of the stumbling blocks in my first few years at Wellford . . . " Royce guessed what he meant was that he owed his nimbleness to the slow-gaited old man . To Mooney the old mouth must have whispered , Do n't get caught . That was the wisdom that endured . That alone . But while it was heeded , all provisional qualifications faded . Uncaught , Mooney could be accused of nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , for instance , George Hand , who had once lamented the frustration of his hopes  --  and had stayed to see them well on their way to fulfillment . Once he had meant to conspire with Royce for them . They were handed over to him more easily than he could have dreamed . For the College was in good shape . Things had worked out . God was with them . . . while Mooney was uncaught . Let no one scornp183the good at hand because he would have wrestled hard for it otherwise . And there was Carole , too , beaming her confidence that Time was bringing all they needed to their hands . Still unwed , she did not look as if that circumstance worried her . Why should she worry while Mooney was still uncaught ? The uncaught orator said , " But after all , whatever is great , whateveris good , whatever enriches Wellford belongs first of all to the students . They 'll see his face and feel his vision constantly among them when the painting hangs in the fieldhouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you know whose picture will hang beside him . " Of course . Though not to be announced that night , it was yet a foregone conclusion that the image of Tommy Barker would complete the installation on the fieldhouse wall . The winter before there had appeared in the window of a Buchanandepartment store a colored photograph of Tommy , exactly eight feet high and four feet wide . In shrill scarlet trunks and immaculatewhite jersey , Tommy crouched on an infinite plane of hardwood . A basketball clung to the palm of his hand like the opaque , dark globe of a blind fortuneteller . The next fall , when the great zeppelin hangar of a building was dedicated , there it was , this portrait of the ideal Tommy , he who had ( already ) made Wellford University a practical reality , given national visibility to a little college out in the sticks , consolidated the beachhead of Mooney 's dream , he who , almost before the attendingswarms of basketball fans had got used to seeing his image there beside Harvey P. Morgan 's , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mooney 's damned boat along so swiftly . In February of his senior year Tommy was arrested for accepting a thousand-dollar bribe . The money had been paid him for throwing the final game in the national tournament to N.Y.U.Arrested , he never for a minute denied his guilt . He had taken the money . That was what money was for . Suddenly a new light illumined the vast , ugly , tinted photographp184of him . One saw the expression , under his short curls , of a boy who would forever  --  until , in Mooney 's jargon , the last whistle blew  --  go on cutting grass for old ladies , astounding one and all with his single-minded concentration on doing the thing that was there to be done.  |p185AND  STILL the arithmetic was wrong . Tommy had taken the most that was quickest and easiest when he put out his hand for the gambler 's envelope containing one thousand dollars . But what was a thousand dollars against what he stood to gain by refusing the bribe , by maintaining for a few days longer the minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hubbub of dismay that roared through Buchanan on the news of Tommy 's arrest ( roared , for that matter , through the whole nation , making Wellford University more " visible " than even its glories had made it , as a shorn French whore was more visible in the open daylight than ever she was in the nudity of her revels with the occupying Nazis ) that question rose like a ghost to trouble the fullthroatedindignation which might have purged Tommy 's erstwhile adorers . It was known that Tommy had offers to play professional ball after he graduated . Alternatively , he had been offered the managershipof a sporting-goods store in Buchanan . In exchange for his name and presence as inspiration to the sporting fry of all ages he would get stock in the store , would have banker 's hours , would , in a word , live in a financial , social hammock for the rest of his life . How explain the reckless decision to risk so much for so little ? " He thought he would n't be caught , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an explanation . It must be presumed in all cases of wrongdoing , however ineptly hidden . " He was just too dumb to weigh one kind of chicanery against a more probably successful kind , " said Priss , who was not dumb andp186was therefore tempted to blame everyone else 's troubles on their lack of wisdom . She was by no means alone in thus disposing of the riddle . Royce 's secretary , Mrs. Agnew , a Buchananite who had known about Barkers all her life , came full circle to about the same view . Mrs. Agnew 's sister had been Tommy 's fifth-grade teacher and a more distant femalerelative had suffered some molestation ( less than rape ) at the hands of Tommy 's fat older brother . At the time of Miss Halstead 's misfortune , Mrs. Agnew had pursed her lips and out of mere deference to the boss 's taste for decorum withheld her conviction that Tommy was , indeed , the assaulter . That and all she knew of Tommy 's young life had undergone a glamorizing change in the cycle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became for her the school of hard knocks in which Tommy was being prepared to bring Wellfordfrom behind and beat Indiana in the last three minutes of play . His lack of interest in either girls or friends was altered from psychopathologyto " reserve . " His scrape with the law for stealing metal castings from the Worth shipyard was transformed liberally into the natural impulse of a restless boy too young in wartime for military service . ( And after all , the junk-dealers in Bronkley who bought the castings from him meant to sell them right back to Henry Worth . The big top of cost plus sheltered Henry from loss and no harm was done the war effort . ) Mrs. Agnew had never quite joined the Tommy Barker cult that centered in the president 's office upstairs , where the receptionist , Miss Jolas , kept a photograph of Tommy forever gazing out from a silver frame on her desk and public-relations man Bill Munster ran something like a campaign headquarters , complete with bar , where all sorts of friends of the College were welcome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intellectual ( had a record collection , wanted to live in New York so she could attend " all the plays , " and venerated Priss Morgan for her " accomplishments " ) . But she had run into the hallways with the rest on those mornings when a jaunty Mooney returned from a game away from home with a firsthand account of the latest triumphant passage at arms.  |p187Mooney  had a special style for these after-the-game returns to his office . He would appear in the administration building with a newspaperdangling from his dapper coat pocket like a hand-rolled cigarette dangling from an adolescent 's lip . One understood that the sports page had been folded to the outside , and that before he got to the relative seclusion of his chambers he would draw an audience of janitors , secretaries , students , visitors , or faculty  --  sport seeming conducive to democratic mixing  --  and wave under their noses a photograph of Tommy appearing to straddle the necks of giant guards from Minnesota , Nevada , or whatever other hotshot team had tried luck with him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellford lost the championshipgame to N.Y.U. 67-68 . Was n't it heartbreakingly close ? she asked , sighing and laughing and reminding herself that basketball was n't so important after all . Ah , and then to learn so quickly that it was less important than one thousand dollars cash to its chief exemplar . She could explain it in no other way than that Tommy had n't understood . First that he had n't understood the pure , high hopes that she and others had sent with him ; then , when the enormity of the whole crass athletic exploitation rose from the deeps of her mind like a mythical seamonster , that he had n't understood the cold , hard rewards his positionoffered him . He was too dumb . That young Barker was stupid as well as criminal was a proposition that Royce was willing enough to accept as presented . But there , precisely , was the moral rub , the booby trap at the heart of the riddle . For in all that would follow as a consequence of the bubble 's bursting , in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him to make , he would henceforward be tormented by the notion that in spite of stupidity ( or by its very wholesome exercise ) young Mr. Barker had resigned from a vicious enterprise that everyone else remained indentured to . So he had taken the money and got caught . That was his separatepeace . His escape . Fear no more the heat o ' the sun , young Tommy . Home art gone to Bronkley . And thy wages are that the grand manipulators will bother thee no more.  |p188What  he had resigned with a simple ( albeit criminal ) Bartlebyan " I do not choose to " flew to Royce Morgan 's hands like the fabled lead basketball . Someone had to be constant among the shocks that came one after another that spring . And who had to was the man who could . Ergo , Royce Morgan was patsy of a situation that might have made him heroic if nobler consequences were in any direction visible . He was the buffer between indignations that suddenly all appeared to be self-righteous when they were not grossly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy , or did n't mind saying so . They were n't going to , of course . But the College had to decide what disciplinary measures it would and could take to satisfy the thirst for blood . Royce sat in these deliberations with Mooney , George Hand , and Dolly Dowling . " I like to believe there is not the temperament to hold grudges in our community , " George said with his old man 's stiff , tongue-incheekpomposity . " It seems to me the College might well set an example of moderation . " Royce seconded . " After all , we 've been in a sort of business compactwith the young man . It 's hardly fair to deny all our debts to him . I 'm afraid that if we expelled him this might penalize his future prospects disproportionately . There 's the matter of the sporting-goodsstore , for example .... " Dolly Dowling dismissed such merciful visions . He lowered his chin into his open collar , adjusted the famous dimple in his right cheek that looked like a hole for a rivet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not going to have a store in this town . " " Perhaps that was only another rumor .... " " The boys with the capital asked me . I told them what you know as well as I. I said to them , The kid 's a bum . ' They were naturally wavering anyhow , and I can see it 's not an easy thing to decide , you do n't know Tommy , whether in a couple years there 's more advantagehaving up there a name the kids will recognize they want a new catcher 's mitt or a fishing pole or disadvantage , always count/ing their change twice because they remember he was sentenced to a year in prison . " " Suspended , " George said . " You know the sentence has been suspended . " He was trying to recover his breath . He blinked as if he were trying to hold Dowling in focus  --  or perhaps retrieve from beyond this present some vision of justice and right . He had thought , probably , that he yielded to no one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being one-upped by the very man who had made a giant leap into prominence from Tommy 's dishonest shoulders . He had lived a long time . He was not yet prepared to believe a colleague could be so merciless . " Given the facts , " Dolly said . " I might not have known how to decide myself . It 'd be a tossup . " He went on happily , " But I was in a position to know his character . Enterprise  --  the kid has n't got it . He does n't even like to play basketball . He does n't get any fun out of it . He plays because he can and maybe there is and maybe there is n't a place for him in pro ball . So I said to these fellows , He 's a bum . Why do n't you gentlemen buy some oil-well stock or something really safe , like a nice uranium mine out in the country if you 've got too much money you do n't know what to do with it ? ' They 'll thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimple popped like a suction cup , one of those by which a sea creature attaches itself to a slimy stone . " You 've . . . already told them this ? " George asked . He began to turn alternately red and white . He closed his eyes awhile . When he opened them , unfortunately he still saw Dowling . He tried a time or two to speak . Finally he said , " Yes . Young Barker is a burn . It was Wellford that made him one . " He spoke rather loudly , so his words boomed around the presidential office , where they were secluded on this spring night . He added , as if it were a mournful afterthought , " Wellford . . . " As if , while it might often have occurredto him that the College fell short of its possibilities , he had never really grasped before that it might be a huge machinery for evil . Through this exchange , Mooney had been restlessly driftingp190around the room , fiddling with Venetian blinds and fingering the paneled walls as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was said that his hat and gloves had been on the desk top , ready for departure . That had not been many years ago . But a great deal was different now . The grand design , insofar as it was an administrative one , depending on prosperity , was near to accomplishmentnow . A shoo-in . That other time it had been only a gamble . Mooney was not going to quit now . But he had been having high feelings in the weeks since the news broke . He had known pressure and , one supposed , stirring selfexaminations . And now he cried out in hysterical anger , " I consider it despicable to use that term about any human being . " He crouched and shouted into their astounded faces like a spitting cat , " From the time I 've come to this college I 've been aware of undemocratic sentimentslodged in high places . I 've fought them openly and I 've fought them indirectly . It 's so easy to look down , if you 've got a reputable name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pattern that lets you point the finger and say This boy is a bum because he comes from a poor family and used to mow lawns . ' Or , That girl should n't have a college education because she ca n't afford to dress as well as some . ' I 'll say this to anyone 's face : I honor Tommy Barker for coming out of Bronkley . He showed it can be done . He was opening the way for thousands . Where did we fail him ? Where did we go wrong ? That 's the question . There are plenty who say , Shame on you ' to Tommy . " Look ! " he shouted , his cheeks flaming . " Our great friend Henry Worth called me as late as yesterday and peremptorily ordered me to get rid ' of Tommy . You might as well know I just as peremptorilytold him to stick it up his ass . " He followed this obscenity with a shrill , demonic hee-haw that made George Hand 's jaw drop and his eyes narrow with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , a deranged president to cope with . Mooney himself was a little shaken , as if he had only heard the full scope of his passion when the walls echoed it back to him . A little quieter , he went on , " I wo n't join the pack of jackals that wants to drag himp191down for one slip . I wo n't , because I 've maneuvered and I 've begged  --  I 'm supposed to be the president , but I 've crawled on my belly  --  to make this place more democratic . I have the Whitman ideal . I believe an education is the prerogative of every boy and girl we can open the doors to , and Tommy Barker furthered that goal . " This Wagnerian extremity , a great upheaval of temperament where some coolness was obviously required , was all that Mooney seemed willing just now to contribute . Yet , uproarious as he had been , Royce could not help thinking that Mooney was putting on a show for them , that in the very explosion of pent-up feelings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very weird . About to get stranger yet . " Me , I 'd as soon clear out , " Tommy said when Royce talked to him . " I do n't think I give a damn . " Without blinking his friendly eyes , Royce told him that Northern Idaho College of Education was not only a fine institution in a pleasant western setting but that it would be glad to accept him as a candidate for a B.A. with a major in physical education , all his credits from Wellford to be honored in full . At the end of the fall semester he would have the degree that Wellford would rather prefer not to give . " What for ? " Tommy asked , without resentment . " I 'm not going to use a degree for anything . I 'd just as soon stay home . " " All right . But what are you going to do in the long run ? " Tommy nodded his agreement that there was a problem . Only it did not seem to be his . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no opinions on youth in general . " I might go to Korea , " he said abstractly . " You understand that it 's President Mooney 's wish not to be vindictive in any way . He still wants you to have a good career . " " I understand that , " Tommy said soberly . It seemed to him natural that people should not wish to be vengeful toward a boy who had made One False Step . Whatever was presented to him seemed natural enough . O.K. " My own feeling is that even if you waited for a while  --  a couple of years  --  before resuming your studies here at Wellford , you might encounter embarrassments . " Now Tommy grinned a little as if to say , oh , boy , he understood that . " I been laying low . I do n't go downtown much . Kids ask me questions . " " But my own strong advice is for you to finish somewhere as quickly as you can . When this blows over you may find a degree is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd as soon forget about it , " Tommy said . " I do n't give a damn . " He did not go to Korea . He went back to Bronkley and holed up with his family . A year or two later he became a partner in a saloon in Peoria . In the saloon , on a dim wall above a bowling game , hung the vast tinted photograph of Tommy that had so briefly graced the new fieldhouse . If it was not more at home there , maybe Tommy was more at ease to have it there . His name was not exploited in the new venture . He was a quiet , hard-working partner and as he toiled and reminiscedbehind the bar the outsize photograph could remind him and all who got to know him of that heroic other world that it was all right to think about and listen to on TV , but which was just too damn much trouble for a guy to keep up with . In the same way that picture was n't really him , he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who thought their thoughts in administrativejargon , a season of Retrenchment . In spite of a whopping scandal , all was not lost . How could it be ? There were nearly three thousand tuition-paying students darting hither and thither through the early spring sunshine . They were not about to pawn their books and go home to farm and factory because someone named Barker had betrayed their good name ( pretty factitiousanyhow : who steals our good name steals trash ) . There were three hundred-odd faculty members . They were not going to becomebricklayers , nor surrender their disciplines , nor give up the good fight for higher salaries next year because they had been in some abstract way shamed before the huge eye of the Republic.  |p193No  , sir , in the time-honored way of faculties they were going to lick their chops and deplore overemphasis on athletics . Too late for honor , they were going to express to each other their long-withheld suspicions about the way basketball was managed at Wellfordandhonorably give their semester tests and hand out grades when June came round . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College payroll . They were not going to emigrate . They were going to go on keeping accounts , cooking in the cafeterias , dispensing linen in the dormitories , passing news releases to the papers , directing traffic on the parking lots , and planningnew buildings for new students . More coming every year . But Retrenchment . . . everyone knew it was time for that . Truly shaken to his soul by the scandal , George Hand pleaded most earnestly with Mooney to cut back the athletic program . That phase was finished , he argued . The pioneer days were over . What was now to be worked for was triumph in the subtler game of going for big endowments , bleeding the foundations ( why not a **26;5286;TOOLONG in New York , a splendid modern room where a Wellford representative could offer to foundation men the amenities to which they were accustomed while he pleaded Wellford 's need ? ) ; a more smoothly coordinated administration , with the lines of commandfinally drafted to assure Mooney 's relief from tedious details ; and committees for engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve for faculty frustrations . What he really wanted , down under all his glittering proposals , was Dolly Dowling 's head . And he got what he took to be a firm commitment that Dowling would be fired . At any rate , he told Royce that Mooney had so promised , telling it with a conspiratorial breathlessness suggesting that firing Dowling was going to be as ticklish a business as firing the chief of secret police in a precarious dictatorship . Someone had better be standing behind Dowling when he got the word . . . . That scene never materialized . Apparently Dowling also went privately and urgently to the top . Mooney never revealed what the coach 's whole argument was . Part of it seemed to be that if he went , sports editors everywhere would be informed that Milton Bosky ,  |p194Fergie  Hump , and Keith Buckley  --  that grand trio of cage stars he had brought with him to back up Tommy Barker 's play  --  had long since used up their college eligibility under different names at San Jose , Atlanta , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He also thinks , " Mooney said cajolingly to Royce , " that big basketball 's come to our house to stay , like Little Orphant Annie . " A cute and pensive smile pursed his lips . The jewels of his eyes nearly disappeared under his lids . " I wonder if , in a year or two  --  supposing Dolly left  --  George would n't perhaps expect some use to be made of the fieldhouse . Would n't , in a word , want to go on as before . " " I think he might , " Royce said  --  because he did indeed think this was so , and if he had further thoughts on the matter they had not been asked for . It was his habit with Mooney to give no more than was demanded . " In a word , we 're sort of stuck with what we 've started , " Mooney said . He brooded picturesquely on the melancholy of that circumstance . Sighed . " We ca n't get out . " Only , Royce remembered , Tommy Barker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ? " Mooney asked . Sitting on the edge of Royce 's desk , swinging a plump , well-tailored leg , he was playing the poor rich boy  --  there had been more and more of that lately in the mode of his relations with Royce ; it was an act that took the place of any real ripening in their friendship or association  --  requesting one more indulgence from a sober uncle . " You can make him see we 're too near what we 've worked for to let it come apart at the seams . " " Close to the erotic university ? " Royce laughed . Mooney looked around as if afraid they were being overheard . He remembered the night on the Morgans ' porch when such terms had been used , but that was hardly what he had been thinking of . " To a university program , " he said prissily . " Oh , we 're going to make it in spite of my blunder in offending Henry Worth  --  and a lot of other blunders you know about and have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " You really told Henry ... ? " " His face is turned away from us . " The Old Testament heaviness pronounced so pertly was touching enough . What it fully meant was Mooney 's secret . " Have George or Dowling been to Henry ? " Mooney shook his head . " I think neither one has dared . But they might go  --  either one  --  unless we can patch things up among ourselves . Again , I ca n't believe this is a matter of life or death . I 'm merely going back to something I think you believe  --  that if a course is decided , it 's better to implement it in harmony . " " Have I said that ? " Royce asked with a start . Then it seemed to him that of course he had . His whole life here with the College , his marriage , too , amounted to a statement of that principle . Only it was something of a jolt to find that Mooney  --  who was known to be so cunning at seizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crucial to it  --  should also have been able to sum up the meaning of his years . To sum them up before Royce had them squared for himself . Again the advantage went to swiftness . " I suppose that 's exactly what I have believed , " Royce said . Smiling , he said , " So I 'm caught with it . It appears I do agree with you . Ergo , I 'll tell George so . Make him see reason : " " Of course I mean put the squeeze on him , ' " Mooney said  --  to take away the curse of meaning exactly that by stating it as a joke . " As for this awful business of eligibility , Royce , I swear I knew nothing about it . I was as shocked to hear about it as you are . " He shrugged  --  perhaps at the risk of scandal on scandal that it had brought to them . " But I 'll tell you . I believe that Dolly 's years of beating the law are behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he 's a good , aggressive coach . " Royce Morgan saw the means by which Wellford was being transformed . So to himself he might , he must , whisper , " It 's all a fraud . It 's all a fraud . " As clearly as little Mrs. Burke  --  and no more clearly  --  he saw how the worth of education was called in question by thep196methods that advanced it . And there were times when he indulged a private frenzy to drive the money-changers out of the temple  --  or , to pull the " temple " apart . And he refused to rock the boat for precisely the same reason he failed to command it  --  because in that core of a man where decision is made , he did not care enough . He no longer cared , as once  --  perhapsbefore the war and before his cold peace had been made  --  he would have cared . He had a job . In a fine manner of speaking Mooney had given him a job  --  of compromise and balance and securing harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more satisfying than any he could have designed for himself . And he did not know  --  as far weaker and more vicious men than he would have known and long since blurted out  --  that what he was doing was wrong . He might whisper that all this was a fraud ( that his marriage , too , was a fraud perpetuated and enabled to continue by his resourceful tolerance when its built-in disharmonies might long ago have wrecked it ) . He had only to look out of his office window and see that Wellford University was a success . The " Whitman ideal , " however adulterated , twisted , parodied , hammered , whored , and misused , simply worked . There they came every day , the students in their freshman beanies and bobby sox and porkpie hats and plaid wool skirts and shirts open at the collar . They came to learn the world 's illusion , and very few before his age would guess what shabby , simple lies that illusionwas founded on . But they learned so much before that wisdom could set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recognitions , the additions , the qualifications , the individual shadings and modulations , the quickenings of heart and mind , the extensions and play of the mind 's light that here  --  right here !  --  on the neutral surface of the planet were the unremarked circumstance of every day . To his multiplication ( illusory though it might be at last ) a decent man could make only one response . He must say , " More . " Always that . More light in more lives more of the time , though the light sprang from darkness to which it would return.  |p197At  home , though his marriage was a fraud ( by all intellectual summation its possibilities were seen as long since exhausted , now mere endurance , repetition , the hollow observation of pieties and manners without content ) , he had two sons now . He supposed Priss wanted to be gone . She said so as often as she pleased . In her second pregnancy she had comforted herself for weeks on end with thoughts and talk of suicide . But he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he could , sparred with her and let her buffet him when that worked . And it was just as easy to say their life was a miracle as a fraud . For each day there were the gestures of love , the recognitions , the additions , the qualifications , shadings , and modulations of animal life disciplined by mind and manners . To all that , as to the wonderful College , a decent man ( who had no Faith to say otherwise ; who had read Kierkegaard and knew the temptations but not the permission to become a Knight of Faith ) must say , " More . " More in challenge than contrition  --  feeling bad one day in the seventh month of her second pregnancy  --  Priss had told him about her hideous little affair with LeCoeur . The whole thing had come out , the wonderfully complex , pointless coyote-in-a-cage rationalizationsof an artist monkeying with life . He had listened with smiling disgust . As she had intended , he had learned to know more in these years about the kinds of pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by degree . Some kinds of pain are straightforward , straight to the heart . There are others at their worst in being loathsome and crooked , though slight , like those which pass the novocaine block from a dentist 's drill . He was not immune to those . She found what must be his last vulnerabilities , and shook him with the horror of finding himself able , finding himself disgustinglystrong enough , to take them without being knocked down . Even strong enough to live with the knowledge that she always hurt him most out of frustrated love . She tried to mislead him from his chosen course because she loved him  --  a doubly frustrated Delilah who tried to betray him into being Samson so she could get on with her proper business of delivering him to the Philistines . She still hoped lovingly for the great and sundering gesture from him . Butp198love and survival posed different requirements . He denied her love its wish so it could go on being , however frustrated , at least love . He kept the cage locked so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequel to liberty . And he wondered how long he would postpone her desire . All his life was a patching and postponement . He did not see what else he might do . He was not the first good man who preferred injustice to disorder . That was the most he could say for himself in these years . The criminal ( Tommy Barker ) and those without responsibility ( Mrs. Burke , whose number was legion ) could count themselves out . He was neither of these things . He stayed . Nevertheless he was tripped from his balance . The abyss had a false bottom after all , and without expecting to , he looked under it finally . He began to see how much farther down the depths extended one night in that spring of the basketball scandal . He ran into Henry Worth at the Country Club . Their encounter took place toward midnight in the small Men 's Bar off the corner of the dance floor . He was good-humoredly sparring off jokes about Tommy Barker with old acquaintances when Henry came in . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get something off his chest . Noting the approach , Royce thought ( and would think again afterward , trying to establish some frame of reason , motive , sanity itself around what Henry actually said there ) he was enraged by the way the basketball scandal might collapseall Wellford 's pending ambitions . Henry had opposed the deal with Nadige . He was dragging his feet , at least , and putting off a similar arrangement with Collins Radio and Erco Battery . In his present state of mind ( after having been told to shove something , especially ) he was contrarily capable of wanting somebody 's head if those pending negotiations were definitely spoiled . That much explanation of his wrath was ready-made , a pat interpretationthat could be fitted to him the second he swam into the corner of one 's vision . Royce greeted him mildly and went on with his chatter . Henryp199ordered a drink with just a bit of the air of a man who has felt himselfsnubbed . He took no part in the conversation until there was a little stir and shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left . Then he spoke grumpily  --  and loudly enough to be overheard by anyone there . " Royce , I owe you an apology . " Royce bowed slightly and waited , smiling as foolishly as a man would have to in this awkward confrontation . He had no forewarningof any offense against him . What had Henry done now ? " You 'd have made the better president , " Henry said . The crudenesswas almost necessarily calculated , Royce thought , and he wondered if the man were simply drunk . He had never seen him so in public ; there had been stories now and then about his being publicly vicious to his wife . " I might have immodestly agreed with you , " Royce said , " once upon a time . " He waited a little for a response , then said , " I hope you 're not letting a trivial irritation carry you too far . " " What 's trivial ? " Royce said , " I suppose all of us are sore this spring about what happened to ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all of us at the College who are responsible . But I think all the criticisms I 've heard of President Mooney have been trivial  --  not to say rather ungraciously belated . " Henry nodded . " You 've heard criticisms , have you ? " " A good many ridiculous things . " " Criticism , " Henry snorted . His inflection implied that critics were now saying Mooney had not died in a suicide pact with Eva Braun nor been cremated in Berlin as the world had been told . Royce began to heat up . " You know well enough I 'm in a position to hear a lot about him from all sorts of disgruntled people . Students , staff , townspeople ... " " Carole Prentice ? " Royce stiffened . In spite of the effort to keep control he stretched to his full height and seemed to tower menacingly above the shorterp200man . And he knew at the same time this was what Henry wanted , was playing for . Now he knew Henry was challenging him to go for broke . " Carole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money man 's smile tugged the corner of his mouth , hard as death . " This is getting quite unpleasant , Henry . " " Things have been made unpleasant for us who have some interestin the College . I have some interest , though only a trustee . " " Perhaps in a meeting is the place . . . " " Where that little fruit can lie to us again about what he 's up to ? " The full brutality of the question was on its face . Again the calculationfrom which it must have sprung and the careful placing of the key word hung after it in the silence , the hushed breathing of all who had to overhear . Royce tried once more to hold the peace . " Well ... " " Way-ull . . . you may be right , ' " Henry said . He turned on fury like a man turning on a blowtorch . " Do n't tell me I may be right when I am right . If 1 may presume to enlighten you . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what really rankles people . It 's not whether some two-bit hoodlum from Bronkley sells out a basketball game . It 's that fruit thinking that he alone is going to pass judgment . It does n't matter what we want . " " I heard your description of him before , " Royce growled . He trembled like a big dog held on the leash at a hanging . " In common decency , I think you 'd better not repeat it again . " But that was just what Henry meant to repeat . Too late Royce saw the real edge of the weapon . Henry grinned and his voice was much calmer . " Why , Royce , it 's common knowledge among the men of this town , " he said , " that Mooney is a bee-it quee-ah . He bleaches his hair , you know that ? Christ almighty , he 's fucked everyone he dared , from this kid Billy Cox to the interior decorators who did the mansion over . " There was n't , there could n't have been , any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worth was prepared to spread his accusations into common belief.  |p201And  that cruel intent , the face-to-face confrontation with a cruelty his intuitions had simply never registered before , broke Royce into the world of passion . Now he was almost forty , and he had never known before that he was big and strong so he could kill . He meant  --  for one irretractable second that changed him  --  to kill this man . Then he said , " Henry , not the slightest rumor to support your accusation has come to me . " He blinked , and in the fraction of a second his eyes were closed he saw the blue mimeographed sheets of mad Miss Halstead 's bill of particulars . Those rumors then had been weak as Miss Halstead . Now they were strong as Henry Worth and perhaps that made more difference than their truth or falsity . He was at the door of a strange world . " I 'm confident there has n't ever been such a rumor , " he said with a growl . " If I hear it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will whip you ! Do you understand me ? Or have you drunk too much ? " The three men drinking at the opposite side of the bar were silent as mummies . Their averted eyes were indication that they were dangling on this violence like steeplejacks dangling from safety ropes . Desperate , waiting for some heavenly fire department to come and get them down . Then , with vast surprise  --  as if he were watching some newborn ungainly thing emerge from the shell of an egg , horrified equally by the emergent enormity and the fracturing , splintering shell of himself  --  Royce saw his own hand reach up and close on Henry Worth 's tie . He tugged it a couple of times . Henry 's close-cropped head bobbed like a church bell . And Royce was going to pull it down until it rang against the edge of the bar . He was going to -- -and for the rest of his life he would believe he should have . But he stopped . With a gesture like ridding his hand of garbage he let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and walked out . At four that morning he was sitting alone in the study of his quiet house . There was a storm in him and it made him shake . More than that was hard to be sure of . Where did the wind come from thatp202shook him ? And was it laughter or disgust that gusted through his mind , self-contempt or outrage ? He was in a passion and for once he would have to look outside himself for the means to control it . The authority he had lived by , the confidence that he was beyond surprise , had failed him now . He had been surprised , and not by what Henry had said , either , but by a conclusion that formed in his mind almost as he let go of Henry 's tie . Henry had always known about Mooney 's perversion . Henry had deliberately accepted for president a man with the kind of debility which , in theory , would make him easy to control . Had wanted a puppet in the very simplest sense of the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry bargained for , had been rather unpredictably successful in maintaining his independence while Henry fumed . They had gone on all this time maintaining a balance of power like two pirates on a captured ship , each threatening to blow the hull and all the sleeping passengers out of the water rather than relinquish his claim to control . What infuriated Royce was the extent to which he had helped them both . And what he was tempted to , in his rage , was to goad them on , tell them to set the powder train and have done with the entire farce that passed for an educational institution . Worst , he had let himself be fooled . He had justified his continuanceat Wellford on the assumption that there was more smoke than fire in the hints and rumors about Mooney . And year by year he had woven his own life into the web of their lies , had committed his family and others precious to him so there was no acceptable way out for them either . He had been a Judas goat for those he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Henry Worth , " always known " that Mooney was intolerable as president , known that Mooney was homosexual and known the risks that went with such a case ? He might be excused on the plea that he had no solid evidence . He could not excuse himself that way . He remembered a trivial episode now : Mooney had called in the editors of the student paperp203and in Royce 's presence was rebuking them for not having their facts straight in a story that bore on the good repute of the College . And one of the half-sophisticated farm boys , all-repentant , eager to oblige and make up for injuries , had said , " Gee , President Mooney , you really caught us with our pants down . " Royce had seen  --  he saw it again now , totally meaningful in its simplicity  --  how Mooney closed his eyes with a wince of panic and then , after a minute 's hidden reflection reassured him of the naive innocence of the boy 's remark , opened them like dawning jewels of indecent mirth , revelingin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a lapidary miniature of the abysmal truth that engulfed them . It stung now because his own innocence had been almost identically maneuvered . It stung more because his innocence had been , on principle , chosen by himself . It was not pure , but had about it some of the shameful smell of mere convenience . He had conspired at his own betrayal . The question now was how much of his world had been betrayed with him , through his tolerance ? Ordinarily when he drank he measured his drinking with unconsciousregularity . Tonight , alone now , he was drinking like a thirsty man who has forgotten what the stuff is for . It may have been the insult of alcohol to his nerves , but , straining to seize his situation for once in its full moral truth , he had a sudden apperception of his soul . He knew it . There it was , hanging inside his skin like testicles in a withered scrotum . It was his soul that was imperiled by the maze around him , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are threatened with a kick . The vision was very brief . He let it go on purpose , because he could not afford to hold on to it . At this peak of his intoxication he saw simply that hatred and truth had become inseparable in his life  --  and saw how impossible it was for Royce Morgan to live as if they had anything to do with each other . So he sobered himself by sheer determination . He fought himself back into his old cage , until the truth with the hatred was beatenp204down to a level he could live with . He saw that the truth was not to be his . Very well , he still had the strength of his patience to live on . That had to be a sufficient substitute . He did not sleep until he had ordered his feelings . And when he got up in the morning  --  lo , the domestic world seemed to mirror truly the order he had struggled for by himself at night . At breakfast that morning Lot would tell him a dream . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like rich folks , laugh it away as too great a mystery to bother with . " I was following a horse that was n't ours up a hill , " Lot would say , " and we did n't find him . But there were big trees and one of the trees turned into an owl . " " Into an owl ? " Mother would say . " Oh , yes . " " A wise old owl ? " " And the owl wanted me to turn into a spider . " " What did you do about that ? " Royce asked , while little Sherman flirted for his attention from the high chair , and Barbara brought a Man of Distinction 's breakfast to set before them on the handsomebreakfast table . " It was only a dream , so I did , " Lot said . " I mean , because it was only a dream . " " I 'm glad you would n't really think of doing it , " Royce said . Not in the real world of sunny May morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late hours of the night . Rather , repeat the previous day , hold fast to the one saving formula of repetition , lest all evils should swarm in through the single breach . He had been warned of Henry Worth 's intent to strike . Let him get in his car , drive calmly to his office , and reflect further on what could be done to forestall it  --  to preserve order in the face of new impossible demands for justice . But then , while Priss and Barbara were getting his sons away from the table and heading Lot toward school , he picked up the paper.  |p205On  the front page he read that a local man named Billy Cox had committed suicide by jumping from a viaduct in front of a train from Chicago . From that instant he knew something that in this world could never be reduced to order.  |p206HE  PEELED BACK one more layer of veneer and saw how Mooney had started his career as educator in Buchanan . In that first summer on the campus , a frog in a brand-new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stripped of the props that had made his life intelligible and his vices safe in New York , Mooney must have swung from extremity to extremity among the possibilities of his new life . Grandiose dreams of the good . . . Royce could not sincerely doubt that these had fumed behind those jewely eyes . Later , in the Morgans ' stable loft , Mooney had once and for all convinced his witness of his passionate idealism . Yes , of course . Mooney had seen his move to the Midwest as the opening of a frontier where the " Greek ideal " could be realized . There was not even any need to doubt that  --  while one realized at the same time that the newcomer must have recognized his frontier to be open for plunder and license as well . Indeed the heart-warming that came with opportunities of a constructive sort must have suffused the whole torso , activating the lower centers , setting off gonadal aspiration as a natural accompaniment to great plans for expanding the College . Further , Mooney must have been lonely in his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Morgans had got their first picture of him through George Hand 's reports . Royce remembered his notion that it had been like seeing the man through the wrong end of a telescope and now  --  oh , very belatedly  --  the significance of that miniaturizing sprang to his mind . It showed him a Mooney lonely in Illinois as some of those first ex/plorers  --  LaSalle or Joliet or some forgotten fur-hunter  --  under the blind vastness of the prairie sky , tempted to abominations by their loneliness as often as they were scared into piety by the mighty virginity of the land . And Mooney  --  knowing Mooney well after years of close observationgave one the capacity for dependable retrospect , obliged one to complete those intuitions of a far-off summer  --  would have twisted the pain of his loneliness into the practical recognition that he was unobserved . People saw him , of course . George Hand and the rest of the summer administrative staff saw him daily . As much of Buchanan as was interested saw the new president assuming his official tasks . But Mooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchers could no more penetrate to what he really was than the Indians or the prairie rodents could have guessed that the lone voyageur was there to ravish and rebuild their familiar continent . He had appeared humble and businesslike to George Hand . Did he not take his meals at Joe Chapin 's lunch wagon , " where the students eat " ? He had eaten there during a summer when all the plans that cunning and opportunity would eventually let him unfold must have seemed to him maddeningly just beyond his grasp . ( Did Joliet , crouched in his stinking buckskins , gnawing at the half-cooked leg of a coon , realize with tranquillity that someday there would rise from this prairie a big , ugly city named after him , and that his fame would live forever on Conservation Commission plaques , free road maps , and in fourth-grade history books ? Not on your life . Every sundown pause for revittling after the day 's trek must have found him torn between the high illusion that he was fathering an unprecedented expansion of the human tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of nowhere . ) Mooney saw what could be done with the college they were handing him . But the limitless possibilities were far away . They were a knot in his throat demanding , at least , one sympathetic ear to which they could be confided without risk of scorn . His dream of an education whose end was love . . . . Eventuallyp208he would even risk confiding it to his great enemy Royce Morgan on a certain summer evening . By then , of course , it was already fading , turning into something a clever Mooney could speak of facetiously , into a reality so shored up with banal college procedures as to seem merely pretty . It had been nothing of the sort in July of 1946 , and it took a special ear then to hear it prophesied . He had met Billy Cox in the lunch wagon . The " Greek ideal , " the Whitmanesque vision voiced through such rosy male lips . . . . Most of the diners in Joe Chapin 's lunch wagon would have gone aghast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pomp that burned in his imagination . A fair number of them would have grinned knowingly . Simple souls would have discerned what Buchanan 's chivalry was too smart to be sure of  --  that he was a fag on the make . Not quite everyone who encountered him in the lunch wagon was either simple or smart . The Midwest breeds its strange visionaries , too , not all of whom mature into Frank Lloyd Wrights , or Sherwood Andersons , or Vachel Lindsays , either . Village cranks , prairie-land and slum-jungle dreamers , forever independent as saints , unassimilableas mental defectives , careerists in the loopholes of a society that never quite bothers to notice how little they fit . Billy Cox was a poet . In Chapin 's lunchroom and elsewhere he lent the right ear to Mooney in Mooney 's unsettled period . Royce learned the truth of this in the days following Billy 's dive from the viaduct . In his position he had to investigate the bearing of this death on Henry Worth 's charges against Mooney . Self-interest required him to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincided with self-interest , though obviously in this case no higher authority was going to appoint him to the task of finding the truth . When he began , he could still tell himself that his inquiries were an administrative obligation . And perhaps that meant his duty was to assemble a pattern of facts which would put a lid on the reeking truth . Administration is so-called because of its techniques for in/vestigating away from the truths that private men have to , somehow , " square up . " It may even have been his hope to establish that Billy 's death had no significant relation to what went on in classroom , chapel , dormitory , or presidential mansion at Wellford . ( And , hell , he would tell himself in later years , maybe that 's what he did , effectively , establish . There was never to be a clean-cut issue of his investigation . ) But the course of his enlightenment went oddly . Truth  --  not to be his  --  nevertheless had him by the scruff and went on separating the man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worlds of the schizophrenic . Afterward , like the pitiable schiz , he still had to house administrator and man in the same hide . The worst thing was that he looked hard enough to behold Billy as a human being . That image developed slowly , like an image shading into itself out of its chemical ingredients under the surface of fluid in a photographer 's tank . When it was fully there ( in negative , of course ) the lost boy whose name had been Billy was a mad parody of a lost boy named Lot Morgan ( son of Priss and Royce Morgan , lost somewhere between these stars at the opposite ends of a vast constellation ) . The relation between Billy Cox and President Mooney was an intolerable parody of the relation between father and son , just as ( he saw this too as part of the indigestible lump jammed in his craw ) Mooney 's dishonored dream of education with no upper limit was a parody of the hopes Royce Morgan had been bred to defend . At one point , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of Billy 's poems . Almost all of them were mementoes of the places Billy had wandered , his solitary walks along the waterfrontsof Davenport , Rock Island , Dubuque , St. Louis , and Keokuk . Or of his not-so-solitary carouses in grubby bars , the brief military service in a Southern army camp ( before , as Royce learned elsewhere , he was separated from service with a discharge neither honorable nor dishonorable , presumably not having been taken in sodomy but having confessed to the post psychiatrist that " some/times " he had a yen for the boys in the shower ) . They memorializedthe intellectual love of comrades , and the comradely salutes of his farewells to sodomite companions and occasional girls . There was vision in them , and pathos . Royce did not read them untouched , nor without a strange reminiscent sense of the places where Billy had found his carnal loves . Royce had seen the same rivers at dawn when he was a boy , when he was sheltered by family and position as Billy never would have been nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , poor things . They had been clutched feverishly by a hand now dead . Royce also found ( and this came to him as knowledge , not evidentialmaterial ) the unmistakable and peculiar anguish of sexual deviation  --  that longing merely intensified by sensual gratification , that sense of compounding one 's alienation in coupling it with another 's . Herein the poems were the most poignant defense of Mooney that would ever be put on paper . Not that Mooney was named . Awe and calculation both had forbiddenthis . But he was there , now and then recognizable , usually just half discernible , as the dark lady of these songs . Mooney was present in the verse in other ways besides as adored object . There was a point in Royce 's reading when he said to himself , Why , these are all lies . They expressed a real condition . They told the truth about nothing . The main part of talent given to Billy was the capacity to deny the reality principle . In a second breath Royce said to himself , Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language itself seemed to echo the man who had inspired more than half of them ( a fraction Royce could calculate when the chronology of the relationship revealed itself ) . Here had been the versifying equivalent of the New Man that Mooney represented in the administrative field  --  as if in Billy one saw the primitive of a new culture , something loosely derivativefrom the arts of the past , but owing no responsibility to them . The poems were a curious howl of petulance mixed with a defiance that needed only cunning like Mooney 's to give it an advantage over all slow responsibility . To read the poems was to read what Mooneyp211himself might have said if he permitted himself unguarded expression . The poet Billy Cox had wandered in to Chapin 's lunch wagon one summer evening while Mooney was eating . The meeting between them might  --  without the testimony of the poems to show the fated sympathy between the two men-have seemed accidental . One could suppose that the men themselves must later have told themselves that it was the purest accident . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mooney discovered all too readily that he had found his proper confidant . Nothing said to the younger man would seem outlandish ; no extravagance of ambition , or longing , or loneliness would seem remarkable to the incompetent visionary who had cherished the same in himself . How their earliest conversation had gone , how , for that matter , each had recognized that the other was  --  in this summer and perhapsnever again  --  ready , was something Royce could only guess at badly . However it might have begun , they had taken " a little trip " to Chicago together . At dawn in some hotel south of the Loop the ideal that would someday , somehow guide the transformation of sleepy Wellford College into Wellford University was articulated from one pillow to the next . And hearing it , from lips his lips had kissed , inconstant and wayward Billy Cox had fallen constantly in love . He would go on wandering , would have his other merely sexual affairs , even get married in Buchanan and father a son ( eight months old when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound for St. Louis ) . But from that summer onward Billy 's love was fixed forever by some conjunction of bodily thrill with the glamour of the man he had taken once . As far as Royce could ever learn , there had been no repetition of that little trip to Chicago . Like Carole after him , Billy Cox had been content to admit that Mooney was too busy ( and too highly , publicly placed ) to continue the relation on the terms that had begun it . Billy had worshiped from afar . Along with the poems and halfp212as many pencil drawings also memorializing his travels and some ideal heads of companions , he had kept a scrapbook of his courtly love . Every speech of Mooney 's reported by the press , every photograph of him on formal occasions attired in handsome formal clothes or on basketball trips with Tommy Barker ( there was one pathetic shot of Mooney as he had rushed onto the floor when Tommy was hurt , trying to hoist the dazed youth up in his pudgy arms while his face pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on the golf course with his Buchanan associates  --  the whole loving collectionof the resigned adorer was gathered in a thick , expensive folder that may have been Billy 's greatest work , delivered posthumously not to the world but only to Royce Morgan 's troubled scrutiny . These relics of love were loaned him a few days after the catastropheby Billy 's wife . As quietly as he could , Royce was moving through a half world of gossip , never  --  as far as he could tell  --  moving much closer to open assertion than was permitted by the formula , " Henry Worth said . . . " There seemed to be quite a few in town and around the College who had some wind of what had been charged so recklessly at the Country Club . Behind that , of course , was the residual , malignant , and by ordinaries harmless will of the people at large to believe any manner of evil about a man in a position of prominence . One knew about that . Knew it waited there like a flammable mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of caution . His detective work was precautionary . He knew there was unfinished business between himself and Henry Worth . Hatred or not , he was obligated like any diplomat to prepare himself for the strictest kind of bargaining . If Henry knew something of substance that he did not , that margin of advantage had to be as nearly closed as possible . So Royce called Miss Halstead in California . Atop the embarrassmentof asking her how to confirm an allegation he had once taken ( however gently , however tactfully ) as evidence of her senile incompetenceand hysterical need for revenge , he encountered now in her a fear that accusations were still pursuing her . She wept through/out his call . She supposed she " had heard " the story somewhere . No , she could not think who might have poured such venom in her ear . She was sorry , sorry , sorry that she had ever stooped to make the charge . Wellford had been so dear to her . She hoped she had n't hurt the College ... . He called on Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the married state with Billy those times he was at home . It had about it the air of rooms occupied for a night or a week . Nothing , not even the crib from which the baby listened to their talk , seemed to be owned by anyone . When he had convinced the girl that he was not a sneaky representative of the insurance company , she told him that Billy had been lately more depressed than usual . They had quarreled , though she superstitiously dreaded to remember it now . She thought their problems were mostly money . She was afraid that Billy had " tried to pull a deal " with someone she would not or could not name . This blackmail ( as she ingenuously implied it to be ) had not worked except to screw Billy closer to the necessity of taking a steady job and deeper into his melancholy . He had gone out on the day of his suicide intending to see " Dr. Mooney . " " Dr. Mooney was a friend of his ? " " He 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've heard him talk . " " But did your husband know Dr. Mooney ? " " Oh , sure . He did n't like to embarrass him by going to his house or anything . But he knew him from when he first came to town . He straightened Billy out once before . Helped him . Billy just sort of thought he was it . You know , an older man . . . " Her mind drifted and she had to be brought back cruelly to answer whether she thought Billy might have intended to ask Dr. Mooney for financial help . " Oh , no , " she said to such preposterousness . " You know for sure that this was not his motive ? " " Billy was scared , " his wife said . " He never liked trouble . " " And was afraid he was in it ? "  |p214Mrs  . Cox nodded . " And wanted advice how to get out of it ? " " Well , advice . . . I do n't know if he wanted advice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , I guess . " Had wanted ( as Royce would at length know , but too late for this information to supplement the manageable theory he was trying to use before he had even finished weaving it ) to be told , by the very man he had tried to betray , that since he had gained nothing by treachery it should n't be counted against him . Like the young men in the fable who go out to find and forestall Death , Billy found his " Dr. Mooney " that day he went looking for him . ( Carole would confirm this , too late for her confirmation to throw a useful light . She had been at the mansion when young Cox arrived . She knew they had left together in Mooney 's car on the afternoon of the tragedy . ) He had , of course , confessed to Mooney how he had tried to betray him by going with their secret to Henry Worth . Or wait  --  not how he had tried to deliver the secret for money , but rather how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swinginglike a child on the Giant Stride of a misty playground , swung at the end of a whirling chain over the lip of death itself , the boy must have been holding on desperately to what his twisted fancy still imagined to be honor . And if Mooney had agreed with him  --  as once he had agreed with Mooney , reserving no doubts against the full argument of love  --  then what was worth saving in his outcast life would yet be safe . After his ride and talk with Mooney , he had gone alone to the viaduct and jumped . Talked off that bridge the way Dan'l Boone talked a squirrel out of a tree . Part of this Royce knew when he went for his obligatory confrontation with Henry Worth . He was convinced that no one ( exceptMooney himself ) knew more of what might concern the College than they . Therefore a settlement was possible between them  --  if not a final settlement , at least one that could limit the damage of revelations conceivably still to come.  |p215And  Henry , in an expansive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to whip my ass ? " he asked as they settled down in the privacy and austere pomp of his office . " So you were convinced I was flying off half-cocked ? " " It 's not pleasant to be surprised by . . . charges quite as grisly as those you made . " " You know I was mad . " " That was clear . " " I 'm not mad now . Are you mad at me ? " The question meant , Do you know enough now to understand the foundation of the charges ? " I believe you had a visit from a young man named Cox . " " It was n't clear to me at the time what a nut he was "  --  as now the testimony of the body riven and divided by the drivers of a diesel locomotive made all clear . Failure and death were the great analysts , authorities whose verdict Henry Worth could not be moved to quesdon . " He sounded pretty convincing . " An advantage the living have over the dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the habit of shooting off my mouth until I 'm satisfied I know what I 'm saying and mean to see it through . Cox was n't the first person who gave me the story . " " Madam Farona ? " Henry 's wirebrush eyebrows went up in astonishment . After a moment he grinned grudgingly . " Unfair , unfair . You seem to know a hell of a lot for a fellow who keeps his nose out of the mud . All right . Let us suppose it was Mary Farona , Fox , whatever you want to call her . Someone who knew he 'd been gay . Queer . There 's a funny story about the man who gave him the Rolls-Royce , and I will tell you some time , if you would like to hear . Those boys have an international operation . You know we 're lucky that the Hungarianpeerage has n't showed up wanting to rub down the athletes . At least we ca n't say he 's staffed the College with his former playmates . Howsomever , the point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along what he was . . . . " " Well , " Henry said , " why did n't you know ? " And the answer , plainly , was that if Royce had been ignorant ,  |p216this  area of ignorance was his choice . If , long ago , he had taken his wife 's prompting , he might have gone as far as he was going now after the truth that would bring Mooney down . Let no one accuse another of condoning here . Whoever had known most had borne most , the good and the bad . Why stick at this ? Or that ? Or over there ? If life is indivisible except by squeamishness , the squeamish man can claim only a private value in his refusal to look at the mud . Henry said , " Maybe the point in question is whether we have now seen the end of Mooney 's usefulness . " " Are you asking or trying to persuade me ? I thought you 'd made up your mind to go to the end in uncovering this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only what we have . And you know it is n't very much . Cox is dead . Mooney 's had a hell of a good scare . " " The interior decorators ? " " Interior decoration . Hell , I do n't know anything about them except what I got from a sheet your Miss . . . " " Halstead ? " " ... your Miss Halstead sent me once . I suppose she might have made that up . Do n't you suppose ? " Royce supposed that Miss Halstead had been in the same Stygian boat where he now found himself : She had known the simple truth , and had been tortured toward an absurd action by her inability to reshape it legalistically or scientifically . She had choked on her knowledge . So might he . " You accuse me of tolerating him , " Henry said . He shrugged . " He was doing his job . It looked like he was keeping his nose clean in Buchanan . In case anyone  --  me , for example  --  believed Miss Halstead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Why has n't he married Carole Prentice yet ? " " I do n't know . " " Maybe now he will . I guess it would quiet things down if he did . " Cool the truth off . Heat up the lie . It was the language of theworld of power , and all other language was gibberish or lament . One gibbered or lamented on his own time . They were here to talkp217about power and where to aim it . Henry did not understand that any better than he . He could not dodge the terms . " You wo n't guess about Carole Prentice ? " Henry asked . " You 've been doing some very tough guessing about the rest of us . But there you wo n't guess . Or you wo n't tell me . All right . As far as I 'm concerned I think it would be a smart move on his part to marry her damn quick . " " You hardly expect me to advise him that way ? " " I want to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you do something on your own . Here you are , Morgan . It 's your turn to do your bit . Quit backing away . Of course you 're going to get dirty . You 've got to remember a man ca n't walk but about three feet higher than his own head . " The terms of the invitation were becoming clear enough . Go take your cudgel and hit Mooney behind the ear with it while you still can . Strike  --  not because there is a wrong to be redressed or avenged by striking . Strike because it is profitable to strike . It was still perfectly clear to Henry that the hour Royce must have been waiting for had come . In spite of Billy 's death , which eased Mooney 's position considerably , the faces of power had turned away from him . Or were ready to turn . And yet , as Royce put it , " We have no concrete indication of any offense . " " Ah , " Henry said impatiently , " if you and I both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip he took to Chicago with Mooney in ' 46 , Mooney wo n't stand up to it . I 'm convinced it hap-pened . " " And this is the first I 've heard of it . " ( True . The story , the basis for charges and assumptions was coming awkwardly , backwardly , fragmentarily , and would never be complete . As stars billions of miles apart will compose into a constellation that the human eye must recognize as the representation of a trinket , a man , or a demigod , the points of light in Mooney 's hidden past were composing into the pattern whose truth he would be unable to doubt , whose factualityhe could never prove. )  | " And , " Royce said , " I suppose you have n't asked Mooney . " " He 'd lie . " The assumption was sound , perhaps , but remained an assumption still . And as the real terms of Worth 's offer began to settle , Royce saw himself in a position not to establish the truth ( to set it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it and verify it for his own good satisfaction ) but to choose what the truth was hereafter going to be . Through the days of his investigation , Royce had avoided Mooney  --  a circumstance neither unusual enough to be remarked nor yet quite the usual routine , since their offices were separated by hardly more than a flight of hardwood stairs . Then he called . " Winfred , there 's something I have to talk over with you . " No pause . " Sure . Come on up . I do n't have anyone .... " " Very privately . " Joking , " We 'll seal the doors and turn off the microphone . " " I 'd rather see you at home . " " Then come this evening to the mansion . I have an engagement with Carole , but I can arrange to postpone it . How 're the children ? I have n't seen Priss . . . . " Loyal Mrs. Clifton opened the front door of the mansion for Royce at eight-thirty that evening . Her chops were drooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hellish air of impropriety . In the midst of an easy greeting to her Royce was struck with the idea that she , this ignorant old woman , knew everything , that her narrow-minded loyalty was that of a portress at hell 's gate . " Mr. Mooney 's dressing , " she said . " He was expecting me . " Royce checked his watch . " He 's goin ' out in half an hour . Boy 's bringing the car . " " I 'll wait in the living room . " " Said for you to come up . " " Are you sure ? "  |p219Mrs  . Clifton was always sure of the few things entrusted to her . " To his room , " she said . Since she knew Mr. Morgan was familiar with the mansion , she did not offer to guide him . He was unaccountably breathless as he climbed the carpeted stairs toward the room where his father had died . How many times as a boy had he been summoned up the same steps for a kindly , windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those times , in the most childish of his remorses and misgivings , he had never dreaded authority as he dreaded it tonight . Authority then had been orderly and mild , however mysterious it might have been to his inexperience . Now the authority that waited him was . . . well , not Mooney 's authority , of course , but the authority of leering chaos that used Mooney for its representative . It annoyed him wickedly that he should be the one who trembled in his approach to the confrontation , for he was coming as interrogatorif not accuser , or , indeed , as executioner . He was the one supported by the decorum of the community , hypothetically outraged by a mode of conduct and the strong indication of specific offenses . Henry Worth would support him if he said to Mooney the one word  --  " Git ! " Nevertheless , his breath was short and his mouth dry with apprehensionas , for the first time in many years , he let himself into the master bedroom . It was dim and rosy with indirect lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotion and perhapsof incense . On the wall where his father had kept a Western painting by Frederic Remington there was now a big black and white rubbing from a Chinese tomb , dragons rearing in heraldic combat . Mooney was not in the room . Royce heard the sound of running water and Mooney 's voice called to him through the bathroom door . " Royce ? Is it you , Royce ? I 'll be with you in a minute , sir . Fix yourself a drink . You 'll find liquor in the cabinet between the windows . " The water hissed and rumbled on and on . More than enough , one would think , to fill a bathtub . Turning from the liquor cabinet , Royce saw the keyhole of the bathroom door suddenly turn bright as something dark on the other side was removed from it.  | " Bring your drink and come in , " Mooney invited . His tone was hysterically merry . Considering the nature of his mission , Royce declined . How discussaccusations of homosexuality with a man reclining naked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He sat wearily in an easy chair well distant from the bed where Mooney 's clothes were laid out . " Sorry my schedule is so tight , " Mooney called from beyond the door . " Change of plans . Carole and I are off to Winnetka tonight . We 're going to visit some of her relatives . If you have something urgent on your mind , should n't we discuss it right now ? " " As soon as possible , " Royce said . " As a matter of fact , when you 've heard me , you may feel you should not go away this week-end . " After a while Mooney said , " Mmmmm . " He was thinking hard as he wallowed in the scented water . Presently he called in a thin , anxious voice , " Can you give me an inkling ? " Then , at once , he began to splash loudly as if , after all , he were trying to drown out the answer . " Billy Cox . " From behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Royce could no more suppress the fantasy that Mooney had put his head under water to drown himself than he could rationally believe any such thing was happening . " The youth who committed suicide in such a grisly way . Terrible . I read about it . " " I mean your friend Billy Cox . " The sound of droplets cascading , as if a miniature hippo were rearing out of a swamp . " I perceive that you 've been talking to Henry Worth . " " And to Mrs. Cox . And to the police , the coroner , and several others . " " Police ? " " They gathered up the body . " " Of course . Of course . Mrs. Cox ? "  | " He was married , " Royce said . " The poor devil had a child . " " Royce , I can imagine what Worth might have said . You know as well as I that he 's out to get me . I 've heard what he 's been hinting . He has n't a nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so sure of that , then Billy Cox must have convinced him . " I expect he has n't , " Royce said . " Then why . . . ? " The incompleted question was plaintive as a child 's . Now clearly Mooney was delaying his appearance , as if convinced the closed door gave him some substantial protection . He sighed through it . " Are you , my friend ? Out to get me ? " " Things have to be squared up . " " Then we 're all right . " " We 're in great trouble . " " Henry 's not such a fool as to go to the other trustees with his allegations . His motives for slandering me , Royce , make a sordid story . It seems that Mrs. Worth has learned about Henry and my old friend Mary . . . Magda Farona . I swear I had nothing to do with bringing those two together nor with informing Mrs. Worth about what happened . But Henry is convinced I told his wife , you see . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a face of disgust and said nothing . He was swept with the absurdity of making faces at a closed door . " Henry 's not a man to fool with , " Mooney said in a shrill voice , as if warning his friend . " He 's going to punish me now by characterassassination . " " I do n't think Henry has decided yet what he 'll do . " " Then , " Mooney said , " then ... you hold the balance , I suppose . Is that it ? " That might be it . And as he held a balance , he was held in a balance , and the invisible hand that held them in a balance was held in balance , and nowhere was there any stable ground where a just man could practice his specialty without feeling that right tipped the balance for wrong , wrong for right , and both for an all-inclusive chaos . " I 'm glad to have you for my judge , " Mooney said.  | " At the moment , I ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some grim questions . There 's no time left for half-truth . " " Oh . " Again a ring of thought seemed to girdle the syllable like the rings of Saturn . Then there was another suspension of silence between them as Mooney toweled himself dry . Then he opened the door and stepped naked into the bedroom , stark naked , as if he were inviting Royce to look and be damned . His pudgy body shone rosily , concentrating the rosiness of the light . Against the incandescence of the bathroom door he stood with the supreme arrogance of one so practiced in weakness that he was defendedby all its tricks . He was naked  --  and took even that for an advantage when others seemed to have failed him . His miniature penis dangled in its web of hair like a dial 's arrow resting on zero . " My answer to all the lies being circulated  --  and to you , sir  --  is that Carole and I are going to be married very soon . We 're going to Winnetka to tell her relatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Apparently he meant the shock of his announcement to be devastating , to sweep resistance out of his way . The immediate effect was to appall Royce , and he said so . " You 're appalled that Carole would marry a . . . a . . . a . . . ? " " I 'm appalled that you consider that an answer to specific allegationsagainst you . " No , that was n't the truth . What made Royce tremble with rage was that Mooney would consider the answer good enough for him . It might indeed be good enough to serve Mooney 's purposes with others suspending judgment . " Charges ? " Mooney did not quite dare sneer . What might have begun as a sneer turned into a squeak of wounded indignation . " That I once befriended a degenerate boy named Billy Cox ? That I may have listened without laughing when he said he wished to be a poet ? Oh , my , oh , my . . . if things have come to that . . . . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath of a small-town tyrant who does n't mind making the vilest charges against me at a moment when the future of the University  --  all you and I have dared hope for  --  trembles in the balance . I swear that is the onlyp223answer I 'll make  --  to you or anyone else . Make of it what you can . " " Well , it is n't enough . I 'll try to listen fairly to whatever you have to say , but I know part of the truth about you and Billy Cox . That one time or another you and he ... " Mooney reached for his pants . A wondering smile spread on his face . " Royce , Royce , I 've always counted on you to tell me off when I 'm wrong . . . . " Silence . The disproportion of measure was too glaring , the old glib formula inadequate as a cord string to hold back a rockslide . " You have great influence with Carole , " Mooney said . " Are you going to tell her I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for a homosexual . None , apparently . None to use now . Mooney seemed more troubled now , driven by the other 's solemnityto search for a solemn basis for treaty . He said , " So you 've been investigating me . Well , I 've been investigating you . I 've learned about you from Carole . And what I 've learned  --  I say it with all respect , believe me  --  is just how much responsibility you feel for what . . . for what she 's become . " " I do n't see that Carole 's involved in this just now , " Royce said . Mooney laughed at him . " She 's let me see everything . You know as well as I that she 's not a strong woman . She 's teetering on the verge of alcoholism , if not something worse . Mental collapse ! There , I 've said it . So she 's turned to me . Has come to me because I offer her something . " Go ahead . Destroy that . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'll believe you because you 're Royce Morgan and can not tell a lie . Sorry , I too respect your integrity , but . . . She 'll believe you . And then what ? Do you want her back ? You want to wreck her ? Do you want her on your hands ? Is that what you want ? Tell me what you want . " " I want you to tell me the truth . " Mooney reeled with astonishment , for once perfectly genuine . " You expect me to confess ? " He had thought  --  it was the humblearrogantkeystone of his whole position in Wellford  --  that Roycep224Morgan saw through him too well to expect that . " Tell Carole whatever you want about what I am . Go on . Make it all up yourself . " But he still did n't really expect the other man to make up lies . He was beginning to glimpse an escape route , wondering how much loot he could take with him as he fled . It was a game with him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still saw no alternative to playing life like a game . Therein , still , under the ax or not , was his advantage . Which Royce understood . In no sense were they talking man to man . Even here , even now , nimbleness remained for Mooney the supreme substitute for virtue . Slowly Royce said , " I do n't suppose I would tell Carole you were  --  or had been , in the past  --  a homosexual . I doubt if it would in itself be so shattering to her as you 've suggested . It might be shatteringto her if there were a big local scandal . She knows enough about you to rest in her private evaluation . But if you force me to go to Carole I 'd tell her ... " " There wo n't be a local scandal unless you decide on it , " Mooney said resentfully . Whether he was through denying he had been to bed with Billy Cox or not depended on how things worked out . One could certainly rely on him to stop denying it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd tell her you killed Billy , " Royce said , hatred roaring into speech for once in his long association with Mooney . Mooney blinked . Then , quite visibly , he started to relax . He had been putting on one after another garment as they battled . Now he was ready to go to the mirror and tie his tie . He was in the clear now . Royce might have pinned him with an accusation of homosexuality . The graver charge simply flew over his head like a blast of wind from a cannon shooting blanks . " You 'd been  --  is the word lovers ' ?  --  and you brushed him out of the world when he threatened to embarrass you . That 's what horrifies me . " " A manner of speaking , " Mooney said . " You 're talking wildly and I have no responsibility for his death . Well , a general responsibility , yes . No man is an island , is he ? And I 'll admit to being horrifiedp225too . I 'd known the boy slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's gruesome . " He finished tying his tie . Royce stood up , rising to his full height with difficulty , turning to march slowly toward the door like a ponderous blind man . " Oh , do n't tell me what you plan to do , " Mooney cried bitterly after him . " I suppose you and that Henry Worth have something cooked up . " " Nothing . " " If you 're going to ruin me , maybe I ca n't stop you . Only , I beg you not to hurt Carole any more than necessary . You see , whatever you believe , I love Carole . I love her . " Royce kept walking . At the head of the stairs Mooney came runningup to him . His face was twisted in an appeal , and it struck Royce that the oddly superhuman authority that had showed in his nakedness was all vanished from him . " You forced me into a fight I did n't want , " Mooney said . He was panting a little , in a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm he had shown when another man might have raged or cowered . " You force me , " Royce said . " I came here to find some way to go on . You force me to tear things down . " " Well , for God 's sake do n't come in here and go out like a bad impersonation of the avenging angel . Look , I have n't been myself . I do n't know what I 'm saying half the time these days . I did n't mean to be offensive . I 'm scared . You knew I was scared . For Carole , too . Maybe this is n't the time for us to get married . Royce , you and I will both go to her together ... " " That 's absurd . " " No . No it is n't . You can tell her whatever you want about me and give me a chance to explain and you a chance to cool off a little and . . . you said I killed him . Now you know he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you killed him . " They were moving down the stairs together , and Mrs. Clifton 's shadow was flickering momentarily across the carpet below . Mooney lowered his voice . " This goes beyond all bounds , Royce . It is n't like you to say things so wild , so extreme . This business comes up.  |p226Accusations  are made against me . You might well wonder . It 's your character to want to know what 's what , but . . . I 've always valued your good opinion and I 'd like a chance to straighten this up . " " You never had it , " Royce said . As he got out of the house he gasped like a man suffocating . He hoped there was still time , under the implacable wheeling of the night stars , to determine at last , once and for all , what action , of those still possible , might really be his own . In the last hour he had shucked off any lingering notion that he could solve his riddles by any sort of administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mooney went or stayed . All that mattered was how he could resolve his own life within the net of unacceptable alternatives Mooney had draped on him.  |p229ROYCE  MORGAN had come home from the war with no Purple Hearts to show what had happened on Saipan . ( As a matter of fact he was given a Silver Star for his service as liaison officer there . ) In moments of great challenge he always afterward remembered this : He was aboard a carrier seven or eight miles off the green shore , representing General Greave , whose brigade had already landed . Before long he too would go ashore , and as he waited to be carried over there he was more terrified than he could have found language to admit . He could not have said exactly what it was he expected to happen on the island . The battle was already joined , and the possibility of wounds or death was there . But something else seemed to tease his mind with its prospect  --  some violence of the soul for which he was not prepared , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared to accept even his own death . He was standing late one afternoon on the flight deck , watching the green hills half down on the horizon . The headwind was warm . The sea had a curious purple cast in a color generally leaden , as if its depths were a luminous red obscured by surface layers of partial opacity . Other elements of the great fleet were strung out behind the carrier toward Guam . At this distance from the island there was no sign at all of a human enemy . There could be , in the minds of staff officers like him , no doubt of victory in the assault . But still he knew that the forces with which he had come were about to engage in something " unbearable . " That word , in its full force , was very distinct to him as he stood on the wallowing slab of the deck.  |p230For  a minute or two  --  the duration was brief , the force of certainty literally uncanny  --  he believed the deck was his old raft anchored in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and that Carole Prentice was alone with him there . The scale of the carrier was transformed , or perhaps Carole was , for the instant of the hallucination , immensely inflated . She lay the whole width of the deck . She was relaxedin the ease of her trust in him . She propped the weight of her immense head on a naked forearm . She seemed to be there on purposeto offer him the choice of staying safe with her on that bobbing ark  --  hiding in some regressive cowardice , as he interpreted the vision in his rejection of it  --  or of going free toward the green shore on the horizon where the unbearable thing was to be accomplished . He was neither then nor later a believer in the occult . He had no concern about his mental stability . He always thought his mind as resistant to disease as his body , and he was one of those who have never been sick a day in their lives . So he dismissed this warning image of Carole , went over to Saipan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mental cogs that he had experienced . Of what came later on the island , he remembered sitting on a green hillside , chowing with some correspondents and some other headquarters officers who had just come back with him from the line . His unfired carbine lay beside him . As he ate , his mess kit rested on boots spotted with blood and flakes of tissue that were probably intestinal . When he had run through a cane field an hour before , with machine-gun fire clipping the stalks in a capricious harvest , he had stepped in what was left of a Japanese soldier . Whether that man had been close to a shell burst or had committed suicide by explodinga grenade in his trousers , there was little left intact of him between shoulders and knees . Royce was not bothered by the stuff on his boots . Only , he recalled a wry sentiment of embarrassment founded on the distinction betweenstepping on a body and stepping in one . It seemed that some/how ( had the nature of things provided a way ) he ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little soldier surely would not have wanted strangers to see . While one level of his mind fumbled like bruised fingers trying to seize this obligation of manners , the high , refined part of his consciousnesswas trying to puzzle out why one of Greave 's regiments had caved in during the night , requiring a morning of extraordinary effort to establish flank contact with the Marines on their right . It was no real concern of his that the regiment had " disgraced the Division colors " by its night panic . But why had they ? The question was ineluctable . You answered it or gave up the hope of seeing life whole . Under such an air cover as the Pacific had not seen before , after hours of preparation by the Long Toms and 105s on the beach , preceded by tanks that blasted out strong points and eliminated whateverremained of Japanese light artillery , flanked by a bushy-tailed division of Marines raring to advance , this regiment not only balked the orders of the division commander  --  in their collective disorder they had frustrated prediction itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were so many arms and legs equipped with a certain quantity of firepower . Not much was expected of them . But they had capriciously made havoc of the whole invisible bridge of statistics reaching from the Pentagon to this shore . When they broke contact with the Marines ( and with the enemy as well ) the fleet had moved in to fire over them , an all-night barrageto prevent the Japanese from exploiting this inexplicable dissolution . The barrage , as Royce had found in the course of that morning , had made things worse , compounding panic instead of bolstering morale . Royce understood of this what he had to  --  last night he and the terrified men had heard clearly what mankind had been trying to ignore through the darkening years of the century . They heard the death of the personal will in the gratuitously excessive salvoes . What the guns of the fleet meant to say was that neither courage nor cowardice nor even blood counted any more . Forces were and manp232was not , because in the new ontology of warfare ( cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a component of forces spilling toward ends that man no longer dared conceive . Even to forget that afterward  --  to forget it for all practical purposes , so one could smile at his sons and be decent or loving to his womenfolk  --  was not the prerogative of the human will . The forces themselves obscured themselves in the illusion of a subsequent peace . And perhaps not the least terrifying of his perceptions at high noon on Saipan was that real despair need have no emotional accompanimentat all . The nerves do not tingle and the knees can stay quite stiff while the soul accepts its nullification . The capacity to grieve or tremble is lost by compliances that obscure its ever having existed . So , later in the war , when the news came of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Royce was unluckily complacent about it . It was as if these events were not news to him at all , only confirmations , like a death for which he had sorrowed in advance . In an odd , fatal rote he repeatedhis absence from his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing and was again deeply uneasy . He was spared the acute anguish suffered by a good many intellectuals and military men of his acquaintance  --  the shock wave of panic spread by the Bomb  --  because he already knew , from Saipan , what it meant . Exempt when no man dared to be . He had been questioned by the abyss . He had failed to answer , and it seemed for a while he was going to be let off . Now he had to make his reply to Mooney . He did not try to dodge by the expedient of pretending that what was to be done now was a College problem . Whether Mooney stayed or was brought down had become immaterial . How Royce Morgan walked in the slippery places was all that counted . It was his trial and not Mooney 's . He found nothing to trust for himself except a plan so quixotically foolish as to be unprecedented in his life . That is , he decided to desert his wife and children and take Carole away . It rather stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he was totally committed to it before he even hinted it to Carole . His determination settled during the weekend that she and Mooney were in Winnetka telling her relatives about their plans to marry . The decision was made almost simultaneously with the admissionof the possibility to his consciousness , all in one lucid hour of solitude while he was walking home from the campus , while he stopped in the neighborhood store to buy a roll of caps for Lot and a green balloon for Sherman  --  conceived his plan , checked it out with the highest authorities of his conscience , and accepted it , quite as if Sycamore Street were the road to his chosen Damascus . Melon-colored slices of sundown flared through the trees , meaningnothing , but he took them for a sign . He fingered the little yellow sack of evening gifts in his pocket ; thought once , Of course I ca n't really do such a thing . Then thought , No , but I can . Like a temporizing prime minister who has failed to prevent a war , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self he had always repudiated . No commandment was given him . I heard one . I would surely sacrifice my sons because God would surely tell me to if there was a God . He could still smile at the audacity of his thought as if it were frivolous . Frivolous or not , his determination for it was steely . While he was helping Lot fit the roll of caps into a nickel-plated gun ( Sherman was climbing delightedly up his broad back while he knelt to Lot 's height ) he thought , Yes , but I 'm going away . " You 've had a good day , " Priss said to him suspiciously . " Why are you smiling ? " " Because I 've had a good day , " he said . On Sycamore Street he had made the great leap for his life . He smiled  --  not without pity for all of them  --  to think that Priss would adore , in the abstract , what he was going to do for Carole . It was the great leap she had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made it , too , if the occasion had ever called for it . He had not been unwilling . But occasions are no respecters of persons . So Priss would have to adore and be cheated in the same consequence . " Ah , do n't tell me if it 's a secret , " Priss said . " My life is so full ofp234intellectual stimulation , heaven knows I do n't need a husband who tells me what 's really going on in his mind . " " We know each other so well , " he said . " I never feel I have to explain my thoughts . That 's all . " " True , " she said . " True . I suppose I know without asking . I merely like the sound of adult voices . Lot , do n't shoot that thing in here . " The boy had crept up behind her and was holding the barrel of his revolver close to her neck . He grinned knowingly and went outside . They heard the sound of his sly executions exploding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you 've got some new formula for thinking about Mooney and Carole and it soothes you , " Priss said with resignation  --  as if she knew exactly what it was and might be just waiting like himself to see the formula tested . As soon as he heard that Mooney and Carole were back from Winnetka , Royce went to her house to tell her what they had to do . He found her out in the back garden , setting geraniums in soil still crumbly damp from the weekend rain . She looked lumpy and gross to him as she crouched among the plants in her pale smock  --  as if he had not really seen her for many years and was now , for the first time , surprised not to find her still the girl he might have married . When she heard his call and stood up with red face and dark brown smudges on her arms , her eyes apologized for not being what he expected . He smelled the whiskey on her breath along with the kindly , wizened scent of geraniums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I called Priss and asked if I might . " " I know . Priss told me you were back . " " I have something to tell you . " " That you 're going to marry Winfred ? " " Oh . Well . Do n't you think . . . he might have let me know he 'd already told you ? " She began to pull off her dirty red gloves . She tried to smile as if congratulations were in order , then admitted thisp235was Royce and explanations might be due him . If not , why was he frowning so severely ? She led him into the big house , almost as familiar as his own , though it had been many years since he had allowed himself to take the freedom of it as he had once . Tonight he was aware of the changes in the house . They came to his eyes vividly , as in the garden he had been vividly aware of the changes in Carole , almost as though he had not seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old rosewood piano ? " he asked . He remembered a girl with taffy-colored hair hunched on the piano stool watching the metronome with a kind of stiff terror while her loose fingers went blindly across the keys . She laughed that he had never asked before , that he remembered it at all . " You did n't think I 'd keep the signs of my disgrace ? " Her piano lessons had meant four years of duty to that insuperable metronome whose message she never understood . A total failure to advance . " Ten years ago  --  I guess it 's ten  --  I gave it to the Helgesongirl . Vivian Helgeson ? She had real promise . She got married . Ooof , it 's hot in here . Shall we sit outside after all ? I 'll bring drinks . " He waited for her on the screened side porch where one or two or three -- he could n't remember how many , only the persistence of the situation  --  of Deirdre 's maids used to bring them cookies and milk and then later Cokes and sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bikes from afternoons at the swimming pool . She had washed and quickly changed to a white dress before she appeared with their drinks . Her face was set confidently as if she had now framed her explanation of why she was going to marry again . He did n't give her time to use it . " You ca n't , " he said . " You can not marry Winfred Mooney . Come on away with me , Carole . Marry me . That 's the only right way to end our lives and I think you know it . " " Oh . " She opened her eyes as if searching for a huge mirror in which she could see them both at once and reassure herself that , after all , they were a graying man in a well-tailored summer suit leaning to/ward a plump , middle-aged woman still sweated from gardening . There was no mirror . She saw an ageless pair , no wiser than they had ever been . " End our lives . ' Well , I should think . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool the boy off . She had always meant to , had never managed with Royce . " I do n't understand , " she said . In the swift crumpling of her attempt to pass this off as a joke he felt her settling , yielding to his male superiority exactly as she had settled beneath him on the floor of his aunt 's bedroom , and he knew a minute of terrible thanksgiving , as if time had truly been remitted and now into his wiser hands a chance to be loyal was given back to him . All the king 's horses and all the king 's men had , after all , after time had played its destructive joke , pulled off a miracle . The humpty-dumpty urn was in his hands again because he had the courage to seize it . Now there was no turning back . Cowardice and uncertainty had burned their own bridges . There was nothing left but the way of recklessness . She frowned as if she had learned Lot 's frown . Her mouth shaped to a pale , round flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean about . . . well , Priss and the children . " He could have laughed loud at her omission of Mooney 's name . She was his . " I 'm prepared to leave them , " he said . " Lot and Sherman ? " She shook her head in a kind of excited horror , as though some smell of blood were stimulating her erotically and she could n't help it . He was looking squarely at them . He had never seen his sons plainer than now  --  in a summer scene where Lot was teasing his younger brother , both of them naked beside a blue plastic pool Priss had filled for them in the shade by the stable , Lot wiry and reedlike , though strong in the shoulders , feinting and evading the little boy 's square-bodied , butting charge , both laughing as if they knew some antique joke never to be put in words , their weaving bodies like honey marble against a verdure that only memory could color so deep a green . " I 'm their father , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ip237can be their father in leaving them . " As once upon a time I was your husband in leaving you , there on that bed in Chicago . I can reclaim them as I 'm learning  --  help me learn !  --  to reclaim you now . He saw how the miracle was done . How it would have to be done . Just how exorbitant the requirement of faith and strength would have to be to bring it off . But caution forbade him to cite his desertionof her as the model for his desertion of his sons . " I can be their father in leaving them . At any rate , it is n't clear what Priss would want to do about them . I mean , under such circumstances as I contemplate . Always  --  since the war , rather  --  Priss has been straining at the leash to go and find what she thinks she 's missing . You know it 's true that she might leave me if I did n't leave her . And she might prefer to leave the children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expediently he tried to bolster his argument . It might have stood  --  enough to take Carole , at least  --  if he had given no indication that it needed bolstering , that it required the support of practical solutions . She had been his . Now he was losing her again . As he felt her draw back he felt himself recover the mundane sanity which had ruined them . Again his decision became silly . But it was his decision still and he refused to countenance its silliness . He had seen how their flight might work . Even when the vision fled , they might follow it . He would not be put off now by seeing how silly he still was . A schoolman trying to convert himself into Noah , naturally he would be reminded often enough that a deluge does not by itself teach a man how to build an ark . " I think we 're drunk , " Carole said . She lifted her glass to her mouth now and drank heavily . She was providing an excuse for what had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stealing horses . " Besides , " she said with a good-natured chuckle , " it might spoil some of Winfred 's plans . " " That 's exactly what he has . " " Plans ? I know . I know . I know , Royce . Who would marry me for my talents and sweet disposition ? " " I 'm going to . "  | " You 'd marry me because you thought it was right . " " Well ? " Something in her grimace of remorse made him ask her to complete the thought . " Well , I 'd 've let you do that once . Oh , if you 'd ever thought it was right . " " Doing right is important to a man . What 's more important ? " " But people who try to do the right thing always mess things up worse than anyone . " It was true . No one had a better right to say that to him than Carole . Yet it angered and frightened him that he heard Mooney 's voice in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she had earned cynicism , by the same token she deserved to be rescued from it . " I 'm not sure you know all about Winfred 's plans , " he said sternly . " I 'm sure he has a strong affection for you , yes , but beyond that  --  someone has to help you see beyond  --  there are ugly imperative reasons for his choice of this time to marry . " Then he would not let her get them another drink until he had told her  --  as concretely as he could ; not altogether concretely because his own knowledge was not of that sort  --  about Mooney and Billy Cox , about Henry Worth 's maneuver to shoot Mooney down . He did not stress any repugnance he might have felt about Mooney 's homosexuality . He did n't go so far as to repeat his intuitionthat Mooney had " killed " the young man . Yet it was not by these reticences that he failed to persuade her . It was rather that she was still too deeply moved by his offer to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or herself either . She was watching Royce 's mouth , not listening , really , to his words . Still some part of her mind took the gist of his disclosures . She heard him name Mooney as though naming some part of himself he wished to disclaim . " The damnable part of it is . . . in getting rid of Cox he has covered his trail pretty well . " They both heard his voice break in that sentence as neither of them remembered its breaking . She nodded . " You 're the only authoritative ... " " Authoritarian ! " " ... witness against him . "  | " No . I 'm not a witness . I 'm just certain . There 's not much more than a thick sticky cloud of rumor . For him to be married might blow the cloud away . " " Will that be enough ? " she asked  --  as if swaying to the temptation of being of service , whatever the cause . " No one knows at this point . Worth is ready to chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been lucky before . A good deal depends on where I throw my weight , that 's plain . You can imagine the temptation is very strong to tie the can on him . " " I can imagine that ! He 's never liked you , darling . " " By going away with you I 'll resist that temptation . I want him to have what he 's earned . What they 've made of Wellford . " " I thought you approved . Of some of it . " " I never saw an alternative . I hate it . If I have a soul my soul hates it . I have n't stayed around to glut on his leavings . " " Oh , " she said . The evening was gathering around the house like the wrapper put on a bird cage at the end of a day , coming out of the elms like something dense and impenetrable , not to be clawed away by the frenzy of tiny and blunted talons . " Oh . I 'm part of his leavings too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . True or untrue , they did n't matter . Her enunciation of them was a successful step of evasion . " I was n't maneuvering for any confession from you , " he said . But confession was her dodge . Now she insisted on filling their glasses again . Sitting a little closer to him than she had before , enjoying it  --  at least feeling morbidly familiar with it  --  she took the privilege of confessing . " You never did me . . . wrong . Maybe you wanted to think so . I suppose I made you think so . I ca n't let you believe that any more . Even the first time , you know , virginity thing ... " " Was n't the first , but . . . " " Was the first . Well , really was . Was n't the only . I mean , while you were away at school . Sometimes . Other boys . Ones who did n't like you . " " If that 's true . . . "  | " It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " My God . " " It 's true I really was n't ever very strong . Even before you made up your mind to it , decided to face it  --  which I was too weak to do  --  I knew I was n't . Priss is . She 's strong enough . I . . . well , afterward , whatever man I married  --  not so very many "  --  she laughed  --  " I 'd kind of let myself go and be whatever they wanted me to be . It 's not all nice to remember . I should have tried to do more with my own life , I know . " " What you 're trying to say . . . " " What I 'm trying to say is there never was any little old Carole Prentice that Royce Morgan was responsible for . That was all in your head . So ... " " So you 're going ahead to marry Mooney to protect me from him . " " No . No , no , no . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do what 's right . Priss wants me to marry him . Maybe that 's more important than the . . . rumors . " " There is n't any little old Priss Morgan you 're responsible for . " " That 's all in my head , " she conceded , nodding , conceding one minor point only . Her good teeth shone white in the dusk . Not in a smile . He could make out a familiar settlement , half determination and half giving up , in the lines around her mouth . " I ca n't do what you want , Royce . " " You ca n't marry Winfred . " She crouched toward him , begging . " When you told me your story , you said there were things I might not know about . There are things you do n't know . " She fought her obligation to explain like a dumb animal fighting the halter , then said with quick flippancy , " I 've been putting out for Win for a couple of years , so . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that . Priss knew . Do n't you see , she 'd make sure I did ? " Her face showed a small surprise but not the relief of surprise . She did n't need his words . There was an image of Royce Morgan in her mind . It was before that image she must humble herself . And bring it down , too , in the wreck of her humility.  | " He ca n't be , what you say , gay , because . . . Well , a woman knows . " " Gentle Carole , you ca n't know by that . " " He knows how to please a woman , " she said stubbornly . " It 's not my argument that he may have had homosexual relations with Billy Cox and therefore is permanently out of the running . I wo n't countenance his using people  --  the way he used Cox . The sex part might even deserve understanding . But not the ruthlessness . He put the boy away when it was convenient . " " Are you sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Cox the other day when the boy came to bother him . " " Oh . " " What ? " " He told me a different story . That he had n't seen Cox . So what makes you sure of one thing falls in place and confirms something else for me . Carole . Slow up a minute . Are we really talking to each other ? Then . . . then ignore everyone and answer the question I came with . Will you go away with me ? Try to make a life . Try . . . " He felt her obedience again , the slackening of body and will that he could always have when he wanted to pay the price for it . He felt his old terror of being responsible for the totality of another 's will . She asked : " You . . . need . . . me ? " He could not make himself say that he did . He was willing to lie but could not assure himself that was , for this particular instant , the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan is to love withoutneeding . No . " " Misery ? " She kindled with the word . If he was miserable he was in need . . . But she said , " You need your boys . " " I love you . " " Oh , yes , " she said . As if that did n't count any more . As though the knowledge of his love had lain forever like some ornamental cast-iron dog of mastiff size on the lawn outside . She was so used to passing it each day she never expected it to stand up and bark . The issue must be settled without whistling to it . He tried to guess the direction in which her thoughts were wanderingand to head them off . " You must n't believe that Winfredp242will necessarily be saved if you marry him . The lightning might still strike . What use would he have for you then ? " She took this as a reflection on her shortcomings . His arguments could only add to her confusion . They could immobilize her  --  if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't think I have n't had my doubts . But , Royce , do n't you see ? For a long time I 've had to get what I could out of my life . He offers something . All right , I do n't know if we 'll go through with it . It has n't been announced in the papers yet . " " You 'd go through with it if it had been ? " The scathe of his voice stung her like the end of a rope on her shoulders . It was the kind of sting he had given her too often in the far-off years of their intimacy , the kind that could be given without trying , a vile portent for their future together . " I 'm not quite that weak , " she said . " But . . . not everybody thinks like you . " " Thank God ? " " No . Not thank God , ' but others might think I 'd done the right thing . He 's respected , even if the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life . These last few years . . . I do n't know what I am any more except an old , fat drunk . Whore too , I guess . Why ? People always gave me whatever I asked for . Deirdre showed me how I could have been somebody if I 'd wanted to . Why did n't I ? " Now it was dark enough for her to cry , the darkness like a permission . The tears on her face flowed on a scale to match the scale of her mistake . It was her life that was the mistake , a gigantic flower of error . Only , she had never meant harm to anyone . If that was the source of her mistake , she could weep for it but not renounce it . And when she had wept for it , she would accept it and go on carrying it like an ungainly , ludicrous cross , right on out to the end of her days . With that lingering , irresolute farewell in his ears , he started down the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man he was supposed to be could not afford another exemption . He felt his long legs swing like crutches . The humid elm leaves rustled the sound of a Pacific swell . All common sense and all experi/ence confirmed that his attempt had been made too late . Something clear as his father 's voice said to him : Let her go . Let her continue the huge , consistent mistake , or you will go mad . At some point in its wrestling with inevitability , the mind had to uncouple or be permanentlyspoiled , like a spring stretched too far . He was close to his car when he realized it was too late for choice . He bared his teeth , turned , and ran back to where the choice had been . Now  --  mad or not , or just not yet  --  he tried to storm the unyieldingpast . He ranted and bullied Carole . He plied her with liquor and sentimentalities . Deirdre had been unable to wait for this reunion , but had foreseen it , had n't she ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He shouted down or stifled her diminishing protests that Priss was waiting for her , for him . " You 're not going there to see her gloat ! I 've stood by too long , excusing her because she 's gifted and misused her gifts . You 've got to understand she does n't wish you well , " he said . He cursed Mooney . He disdained to enumerate Mooney 's faults . The man was evil . Evil . Pliantly she conceded this . But what else was wrong with him ? Nothing . Does there have to be more ? Nothing . So nothing much had been said against him , and here at the last ditch of their struggle it could still be said of him that " he knew how to please . " On requirement so could Royce Morgan . Had he not , for years , pleased the most exigent of women , with tricks and firmness of the flesh that made even the metaphysical frigidity in the woman 's soul stand in abeyance ? Before that , had he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spoke of Mooney ? Upright and often he had . Had always known he could again at the last resort . " Royce , you 're out of your mind ! " So be it . He was , nevertheless , in her pants . " We 're out of our minds ! " she muttered . A sort of low , wildp244whistle of horror played over the words , like heat lightning at the edge of heavy clouds . " We 're out of our minds ! " They were not yet out of their clothes . But would be , willy-nilly , and very soon , too , unless she found the magic incantation to free herself , for he intended no less than rape , a rape of the past , an Orphean plunge into the tomb between her thighs . He smelled the odor of tombs from where his hand was delving as he ground her into the couch  --  the smell of tropic lagoons where their youth had died . It was part of her charity  --  therefore a trick of her evasion  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him from that crime , too , and charitably cheat him of the crime 's winnings . " If you need me . . . " she muttered . And yielded limply . She accepted his knee wedging hers apart , as if this were part of the celebration of her recent engagement . She let his hand play those tricks of arousal that Priss had taught him . " Upstairs , " he ordered , wild as a Hun , savage in his fear that compassionmight make him incapable . " Might as well for a sheep , " she murmured , now suddenly swept away in a froth of giggles , as if drunker than she really was . She denied him the chance to commit a rape that might have altered his life , but since she permitted him the first and only adulteryduring his marriage to Priss , he need not have feared himself incapable of carrying it through . As they undressed  --  turned away from each other as if intentionally ignoring the purpose of their being here  --  he wanted her as simply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needed her . . . Yes , for a few minutes he needed her . But already , when she lay naked on her dark bed , waiting for him to come to her , the intrusions of experience began to distinguish the one occasion from the other . He could make out the fat hump of her belly distorted to one side by its own weight like the misshapen urn she had left in the studio for Mooney to find . The spill of her vast breasts , her physical dissoluteness , looked intentional  --  like a vengeancetaken on him for daring to remember her otherwise . And he hadp245the curious idea that this was Priss 's vengeance , paid to her in full measure . " Take pity on an old woman , " someone crooned from the bed . He did . He tried to give her something . His erotic competence , so serviceableto Priss , so trained in the stable of her creative lusts , should have been his to dispose where love and pity wanted to dispose them . If they rose from this passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw off , still he wanted them to have that moment of mindlessness , of materiality which one conceives as a substitute for eternity . He thumped her like a champion . He teased and filled her . He lay with his mouth on the large beads she had not removed when she undressed and imagined them reclining so on the side of an urn , oblivious to the snickers of historians watching through the glass of a museum case . Like a rider at the hurdle who imagines in the long upward poise of the jump that he is lifting his eight-times-heavier horse by the sheer strength of his exaltation , he fantasied that he was lifting her with him . Then , in his orgasm , he knew exactly how Orpheus must have felt upon discovering himself all alone outside the mouth of hell . She had not followed . Whatever his intent , she had intended only to give him the old-time , tried-and-true consolation for what could never be . That was all . He had to say something , and he could n't . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be unable to get enough moisture into his mouth to say that now they must go through with his plan for getting away . " You . . . pleased me , " she said with infinite tenderness . " Beautiful , Royce . Beautiful . " He thought she meant he was beautiful , and of course he could not comment on that . " What time is it ? " she asked . " Is there still time . . . ? " He hushed her with a kiss , since , of course , she had meant to ask if there was still time to whisk into their clothes and get to Priss , pretendingthat nothing had happened.
