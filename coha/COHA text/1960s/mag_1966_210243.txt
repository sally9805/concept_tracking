Return of the Vanished <P> Peter Kapitsa was once a big name in British science . The son of a czarist general , he arrived in Britain in 1921 , broke but brilliant , and won a fellowship at Cambridge University . Soon he was astonishing his fellows with experiments in low temperatures and magnetic fields . Honors were showered on him , and Cambridge built him a special $75,000 laboratory for his work . Then in 1934 Kapitsa returned to Russia for a scientific convention , and Stalin refused to let him leave . Over the years , a few rumors about Kapitsa leaked out , putting him variously as head of Russia 's atomic-bomb program , then as out of favor for refusing to work on the H-bomb , and finally , after Stalin 's death , as director of the Soviet space program . Last week , to almost everyone 's surprise , Kapitsa , now 71 , stepped off a Soviet jetliner in London for a three-week visit to Britain . <P> Kapitsa behaved with the caution of a man who knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mysteries of his past years , brushing off as " romantic " a reporter 's question about his reaction to Stalin 's stay order . He spoke guardedly about the Soviet space program , argued that the Soviets were still " a little ahead " of the U.S. At only one point did he unbend , offering his own formula for peace . It was , he said , " an international exchange of scientists from military institutions . " " Then , " added Kapitsa puckishly , " there would be no more secrets . " <P> <P> Kapitsa seemed only to want to kindle old memories . He returned to Cambridge , visited his old workshop in the Cavendish Laboratory , and dined with the dons at his old college , Trinity . Realizing that he had no academic gown , the required dress for evening meals in college , he asked a college servant to fetch one for him . The man brought back the very robe that Kapitsa had left behind 32 years ago .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
