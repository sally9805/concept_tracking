txt A great many businessmen who normally vote Republican are ready to support President Johnson next fall on one condition : That they approve of his running mate . The Democratic ticket that would draw their vote  --  and money , too  --  against any presently foreseeable Republican combination would have Secretary of Defense Robert S. in the second spot . The nomination of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy as Vice President would , on the other hand , end any chance Mr , Johnson has of drawing widespread business support , according to many of the corporate executives who met here this weekend as members of the Business Council . Regarded as Hostile Mr. Kennedy is regarded as hostile to business , primarily because of the recent antitrust activities of the Department of Justice . The business leaders indicated they had not yet made up their minds about other Vice-Presidential possibilities , including Sargent Shriven ' , the director of the Peace Corps and of the President 's antipoverty program . They dislike Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota , another Vice-Presidential prospect , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Johnson-Humphrey ticket . Whether an actual majority of the 100-man Business Council intended to support a Johnson-qzmcq#Namara ticket was not clear . Many members traditionally refuse to discuss politics at council meetings . Among the corporate presidents and hoard chairmen who would express their views , however , a clear majority favored a Johnson-qzmcq#Namara slate , Mr. formerly headed the Ford Motor Company . Johnson Vigor Favored The business executives say they would favor Mr. Johnson 's election because they think he understands business prohtems , particularly the need for business to earn good profits , and because they like the forcefulness with which lie is carrying on as President . Although only a few would say so in so many words , many corporate chiefs rate Mr. Johnson more highly than any President of modern times , including Dwight D. Eisenhower , It is Mr , Johnson 's vigor that gives him the edge over General Eisen-1 hower in the eyes of many business executives . The choice of Mr. Johnson'sll running mate is important tol , the business executives because they are aware that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal experience the strain that heavy executive responsibilities can put on a ' man 's health . Support for Mr. Johnson , at least on the basis of his actions and policies to date , is so widespread among Business Council members that they seem to have more Interest in the Democratic Vice-Presidential choice than in the contest for the Republican Presidential nomination . Some members of the council said , however , that their relative disinterest in the identity of the Republican nominee arose mostly from their belief that Mr. Johnson was certain to win election , no matter who his opponent is . Mr. has their support because he is a businessman himself and because they approve of the way he has handled his duties as Secretary of Defense . The fact that he has been a Republican in the past does not figure importantly in their thinking . In particular , the business leaders approve of Mr. 's drive to run the $50 billion defense establishment more economically . Mr. Johnson 's efforts to bring about economy in Government also constitute a major reason why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now convinced that he means to curb Government spending as long as he is President and not merely until next November . Mixed Views on Poverty Plan The business leaders have decidedly mixed views about the one major new spending program Mr. Johnson has proposed ? his " unconditional war " against poverty . Reaction to the proposal Mr. Shriver made here on Friday night that business raise a $30 million fund to help the Government eradicate poverty ranged from cautious approval to complete rejection . Those who approved the plan wanted to make sure that the funds would not be administered by politicians either in Washington or at the local level . They said they would respond to the appeal for funds if community-action programs against poverty were administered by local groups controlled essentially by businessmen and such organizations as community chests . Mr. Shriver personally drew a mixed response from the busi ? ness leaders . Some found him " too slick " or condemned him with the faint praise that he , was " a good salesman .
