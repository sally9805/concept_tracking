txt This is the season Giving- when neighbors suddenAway ly become generous with Season things they do n't want . Spring cleaning has something to do with it . Every household annually acquires a collection of semi-useful articles , considered to be too good to throw out , not quite good enough to sell , but good enough to give away . At this season housecleaners come across these items , say to themselves that they must get rid of them , and that is when this seasonal generosity begins . But to be fair it should be said that the spring air has something to do with it too ; its softness encourages a cheerful benevolence after winter 's frostiness which keeps even close neighbors out of each other 's sight for weeks at a time . Persons in a givingAlways away mood try as hard Something as someone who wants Missing to dispose of a litter of kittens to disguise their approach , but they always fail . Anyone with a normal amount of discernment can detect a spring giver as soon as his ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spring giver 's eyes flit this way and that , seeking to learn whether or not one already has an old rocking chair with a sprung seat , or a spinning wheel with all the key small parts missing , or a small trellis that needs just a little paint ( and some nails and strong wire ) to make it as good as new . The things a spring giver seeks to unload on his neighbors always need just a little something added to them to make them usable . For example , a The Radio , small radio that the Tired " just needs a new Plant tube , or something , and it 'll work fine . " A bicycle minus a tire on the back wheel . A child 's chest of drawers with a drawer missing which , says the would-be spring giver , one can " fix up like new in just a few minutes . " A weary plant in a cracked flower pot , which arrives with a little speech to the effect that one does n't seem to have any plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ' nice if * * * ? " No , it would not . One would have plants in one 's window if one were able to keep them , alive , but long ago it was established that house plants wilt and perish under certain hands ; this house is not for plants . And because one already has a small , nonoperating radio that needs a new tube , or something one does not wish for another . Nor a bicycle minus a rear tire , nor a bit of child 's furniture lacking a drawer . It is time , now , for Hiding the bush and shrub Behind spring giver to peer the Hedge over the hedge of a Saturday morning into the garden where one is working . " Hello , " he says cheerfully , and one knows that behind the hedge he is hiding a rose bush he has just dug up , a bush subject to black spot , mildew and every other ailment known to rose culture . Or he has some monstrous-looking bulbs which , he says , if planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is just one little thing  --  these bulbs must be taken from the ground before frost each year and hung in the cellar every winter . The spring giver lacks the courage to throw these things away , but he has the intrepidity to bestow them upon his fellows . A little later another The Hit- spring giver will be and-Run around , peering at one 's Giver garden and the struggling , scrawny zinnias in it , the zinnias with which one is wholly satisfied . Next day , outside one 's back door , will be a large bundle of zinnias wrapped in wet newspaper . The spring giver who grew more zinnias than he knows what to do with has thoughtfully and generously disposed of three or Four dozen of them and that , in a small garden , is a lot of zinnias . Nothing in the etiquette books deals with how to dispose courteously of unwanted gifts of zinnias , tomato , petunia or hollyhock plants . Pernaps there is no courteous way .

One need only deliver firm , " No , thank you , " to the spring giver . But why is that so lard to do ? Why ?
