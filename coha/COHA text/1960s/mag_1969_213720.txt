One of Asia 's enduring insurgency problems is the feud between the guerrillas of the Hukbong Mapagpalayang Bayan* and the Philippine government . For more than two decades , the Huks have been active in what is commonly called " Huklandia , " an area in Central Luzon where social and economic ills create a fertile breeding ground for discontent . At the height of the insurgency in 1950-51 , the Huks had an estimated 20,000 well-organized men under arms . A concerted government drive led by the late Ramon Magsaysay , then Defense Secretary , whittled that number down drastically , but did not succeed in stamping out the insurgents . To thousands of peasants , the Huks , an odd farrago of idealistic reformers , nationalists , Communists and mere bandits , are still Robin Hoods who mete out swift and bloody justice to cattle thieves and heavy-handed officials . To the government , they are dangerously politicized criminals who must be eradicated . <P> Thus Manila had reason for satisfaction last month when government forces killed 21 Huks in two bloody shoot-outs in Luzon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the third-ranking man in the Huk hierarchy , Efren Lopez , who went by the nom de guerre of Commander Freddie . The action apparently resulted in part from factional division and rivalry among the insurgents . Government forces had trapped Freddie and his men on a tip-off - and that tip-off had evidently come from Commander Sumulong , who ranks directly below Huk Supremo Pedro Taruc . Sumulong had apparently felt challenged by Freddie . Last week , far from shattered , and united again at least in revenge , the Huks struck back . <P> Their cadres had earlier spread word that 21 government troopers would die - one for each of the guerrillas slain in the January encounters . Brigadier General Vicente Raval , who commands the Constabulary , put his forces on alert . But within hours , a band of about 20 Huks ambushed a twelve-man government detail , killing two and wounding nine . Three days later , another group shot up an army Jeep . A lieutenant and two other soldiers died in the fusillade ; the lieutenant 's four-year-old son was wounded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambushes as Huk attempts to " salvage what is left of their prestige . " But a junior officer was less optimistic . " Nobody in uniform is safe in Central Luzon until the Huks get their pound of flesh , " he said . " And they 'll get it , sooner or later . " They probably will-considering that the government has promised much and done little . Huk strength is still estimated at around 300 armed men , which does not sound impressive-but they are supported by thousands of sympathetic or frightened peasants . <P> <P> * Tagalog for People 's Liberation Army .
