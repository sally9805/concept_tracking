Just as hard as he was waging peace around the world , President Johnson seemed to be fighting for frugality in Government . Last week he heard some good news about the performance of the U.S. economy last year , put out word that next year 's budget would total $100 billion , and that he , personally , was reviewing every cent of expenditure . Such tidings were aimed to please-and they have certainly had that effect on the U.S. business community , which has warmed to Johnson in rare fashion . <P> To the banks of the Pedernales River from Washington went Dr. Walter Heller , chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , to tell Johnson that during 1963 the U.S. economy had set impressive records . Among them : the gross national product ( the combined total of all U.S. goods and services ) rose $30 billion , to over $600 billion ; per capita personal income reached $2,500 , up $300 in three years ; U.S. corporate profits totaled more than $50 billion ( $25 billion after taxes ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heller also was the bearer of not-so-glad tidings : unemployment last year remained in excess of 4,000,000 persons-a persistent 5% to 6% of the labor force . This , Heller told the President , was his Administration 's " principal challenge . " <P> Without Missing the Moon . Later Johnson met with Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Afterward , McNamara said the Defense Department 's budget would be trimmed by about $1 billion next year-to around $51 billion . The savings would come mainly from a cost-reduction program instituted by President Kennedy and from a letup in heavy expenditures for the now well-stocked nuclear arsenal ( see box ) . McNamara declared that U.S. forces would be " superior to those in any other time in our peacetime history . " <P> More economies were in the offing as the week went by . Postmaster General John Gronouski emerged from a ranch-house session to announce that his department 's budget request had been cut back by $200 million , and that measures were afoot to whack $100 million off the Post Office 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million saving in the federal budget . Johnson himself disclosed that several hundred million dollars each had been pared off next year 's budgets for the Agriculture Department , Atomic Energy Commission and National Aeronautics and Space Administration . The cut in expenditures on space programs would be made , he said , " without abandoning our goal of a man on the moon by 1970 . " <P> Even if Johnson 's widely hailed drive to economize in Government spending does result in a budget near $100 billion , instead of the $103 billion he predicted shortly after he took office , it will still be the largest budget in the nation 's history . Still left would be a deficit in the neighborhood of $10 billion . Johnson is expected to tell Congress in his budget message later this month that the forecast of $90 billion in revenues for fiscal ' 65 is partly dependent on early enactment of the $11 billion tax-cut bill . One trouble John Kennedy had in drumming up support for the bill was critics ' complaints that he had not reduced federal spending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with some success .
