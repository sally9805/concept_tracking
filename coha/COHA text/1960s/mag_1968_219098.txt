U.S. journalism schools are improving these days because they are teaching less journalism . At both graduate and undergraduate levels , the schools are stressing the liberal arts and down playing the techniques of the trade . In most undergraduate schools , only 25% of the course requirements are in actual journalism , and that percentage is decreasing even further at some schools . " The four years of college , " says Robert Beyers of Stanford University , " is such a short time to acquire an education that it should not be devoted to learning skills which can easily be acquired outside the classroom . " <P> Under Deans I. W. Cole and Peter P. Jacobi , Northwestern 's Medill School of Journalism now requires its graduate students to take two seminars in the reporting of public affairs . Courses are offered in urban problems , education , science and technology . One student who took a course in the U.S. legal system grumbled that it was " just like an advanced political-science course . " The school 's reply is that that 's just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order to avoid too ivory tower an approach , Northwestern gives its students practical experience covering a newsbeat for Chicago 's American . Similarly , some 15 students each quarter go to Washington , where they work out of the National Press Building under the supervision of a professor in residence . The Missouri School of Journalism plans next fall to start sending students to Brussels for a semester , where they will report on EEC , Euratom and other European affairs . <P> As journalism schools have expanded , they have grown uneasy with even the name journalism . Many now call themselves schools of " communications " and try to deal with the broad spectrum of human dialogue . Stanford 's Department of Communication , for example , has added courses called " Government and the Mass Media " and " Ethics in the Mass Media " to stimulate students ' thinking about their work in the wider context of society . At the same time , Stanford encourages nonjournalism students to take these courses , thus breaking down even more the distinction between journalism students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better , broader education , many journalism students now set their sights on careers in other fields . Enrollment at 118 major U.S. journalism schools has more than doubled over the past nine years to 24,445 ; yet a declining percentage of graduates go into journalism-less than 45% last year . Careers in business , government , public relations or advertising offer better salaries as a rule and more promising future prospects . As Bob McVea , a Northwestern journalism student who plans to join a newspaper , puts it : " You have to be dedicated to pauperism . "
