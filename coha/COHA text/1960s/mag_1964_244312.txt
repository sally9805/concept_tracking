THE SUBURBS Castles used to be few , and for the really rich . Today there are apt to be chateaux-modern style , of course-everywhere . Newest patch of stately subdivision is a rock-strewn desert 20 miles north of Phoenix , Ariz . Its name is Carefree , which is reasonably close to what anyone should be who builds a ranch-style house there for $100,000 . <P> Six years ago , this barren acreage looked to the unknowing eye like plenty of sun-baked nothing . But ebullient Real Estate Promoter Thomas Darlington and Partner Kenyon T. Palmer , who bought the sand for as little as $100 an acre , saw nuggets in every boulder . Their original 800 acres , broken up into two-acre lots , have all been sold for as much as $10,000 a lot , and 1,600 more acres have been added . Fifty houses have already been built , and three or four more are started each week . The splendor of Carefree 's citizenry encourages Promoter Darlington to think of his project as a Palm Beach with cactus . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice presidents out here , it looks like a roster of the N.A.M . " <P> The Carefree citizens enjoy a top-hole golf course , shops , airport and an " International Restaurant " whose seven dining rooms are each decorated in a different geographical style but serve the same food . Last December saw the ceremonial opening of the $2.5 million Carefree Inn : rooms , $24 to $85 a night . Like Jamaica 's Round Hill and Antigua 's Mill Reef Club , the hotel rents private houses to visitors when their owners are not in residence . <P> All sites are carefully zoned and restricted to prevent what Darlington refers to as " creeping urbanization . " Creeping cuteness has already engulfed the development , which boasts such street names as Languid Lane and Nonchalant Road . Ho Hum Drive separates into Ho Street and Hum Street . The bank is on Wampum Way . The main drag , naturally , is Easy Street .
