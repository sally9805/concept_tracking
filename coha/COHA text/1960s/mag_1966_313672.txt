BRET HARTE by Richard O'Connor . 331 pages . Little , Brown . $6.95 . <P> <P> Bret Harte had many admirers and almost no friends . Mark Twain , who respected Harte 's work , called the author a coward , a liar , a swindler , a thief , a snob , a sot , a born loafer and a son of a bitch . When autograph hounds enclosed return postage in their letters , it is said that Harte used the stamps to pay his overdue butcher 's bill . He was an instant success at 32 , and at his prime was the most popular author the U.S. had ever known . Yet , though he sold everything he wrote and his collected writing fills 20 volumes , his reputation was built on two short stories and 60 lines of doggerel , which Harte himself despised as " possibly the worst poem that anyone ever wrote . " <P> Not quite enough to warrant a strictly literary biography . Biographer O'Connor , whose previous books have shown a taste for the minor figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack London-sensibly confines himself to the life and the figure of the man . Both make handsome contributions to the kind of story that O'Connor enjoys telling and consequently tells very well . <P> Drifting Dude . At one time or another , Harte partially earned many of the opprobrious epithets that Mark Twain hurled his way . He was quite capable of snubbing friends on the street - and equally capable of showing up just at dinnertime to borrow two quarts of whisky and a room to finish them in while knocking out a short story . " If he ever repaid a loan , " grumbled Twain , who was himself touched for several thousand dollars , " the incident failed to pass into history . " <P> A young dude in a silken mustache and patent-leather shoes adrift through the California gold mine country , Harte discovered the literary lode he was to tap for the rest of his life . The Luck of Roaring Camp and The Outcasts of Poker Flat , two short stories published in the Overland Monthly magazine , gave readers so honest and vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity . It is fair to say , as O'Connor does , that the literature of the West began with Bret Harte . <P> Overland Hole . The two stories and his poem Plain Language from Truthful James , in which Ah Sin the Chinaman beats a table of U.S. poker players at their own game , have found permanent lodging in all the anthologies . Harte himself was astonished at the success of the poem , which was republished in papers and magazines all over the country . He had stuffed it into one issue of Overland merely to fill a hole , and ever after wished that he had n't . <P> After these early triumphs , Harte went on writing for another 30 years , mostly abroad , where he had gone after wangling a post in the U.S. consular service . He formed a menage a trois with a Belgian couple in London , dictating his diary to his host 's wife and patting the heads of her nine children . Finally discharged from the consular service for " inattention to duty , " he lived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer of the throat . In 1902 , he died at 65 in the best Western tradition , with his boots on and almost broke : leaving an estate of $1,800 and a story in progress on his table . <P> &lt;footnote&gt;* In his sleeves , which were long , He had twenty-four packs , - Which was coming it strong ,
