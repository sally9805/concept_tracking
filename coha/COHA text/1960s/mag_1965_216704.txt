St. Johnsbury , Vt. , population 6,809 , could be the archetypal New England mill town . Except for city cousins and stray tourists , the prim stillness beneath the elms is rarely disturbed by outsiders . The world-and even St. Johnsbury itself-seems unaware that the brooding , red brick building across from the courthouse is the U.S. 's oldest unaltered art gallery still standing. * Founded in 1871 , the St. Johnsbury Athenaeum grew out of the 19th century fashion for industrial tycoons to dabble in the arts . Horace Fairbanks , whose uncle invented the platform scale , and whose family built the invention into the Fairbanks scale works , made the standard trip to Europe , returning with the usual milky-white copies of classics . Back home , he acquired works by the then-in-vogue Hudson River School painters , built the gallery to house the overflow . Fairbanks ' most handsome purchase was Albert Bierstadt 's Domes of the Yosemite . The San Francisco Call la mented at the time that the painting " is now doomed to the seclusion of a Ver mont town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have easily astonished sophisticated San Franciscans . Ten feet high and 15 feet wide , the landscape overwhelms the viewer with a vast panorama of nature . The two famed domes in what is now California 's Yosemite National Park soar in the background as the 2,400-foot Yosemite Falls plunges in perfect perspective from under the top of the picture frame into the valley below . Painter Bierstadt traveled to the Athenaeum summers until his death in 1902 to gaze at his masterwork , often dabbing here and there where the paint had flaked . As Fairbanks and his kin passed on , the collection grew through bequests , now numbers 87 paintings and ten sculptures , including works by Jasper Cropsey , William and James Hart and Thomas Moran . Today the Athenaeum remains unchanged . The gaslight chandeliers have been electrified , the timeless hush is occasionally broken by construction next door . But the deep-set windows admit the weak northern light just as they did nearly a century ago ; the oak and walnut floors gleam from years of polishing . And the statuary from Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors the comfortable Victorian world of a prosperous Vermont manufacturer . <P> <P> *Two other galleries were built earlier : Yale 's Trumbull Gallery and the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford , Conn . The former is no more ; the latter has incorporated the original into a larger building .
