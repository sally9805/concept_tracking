 | Good-By to Bobby " One-Eye " Wilcoxson BY BLAKE CLARK SATURDAY morning , November Io , 1962 , was pleasant in Walterswood Road , in a quiet residential section of Baltimore , Md . People were working on their lawns or washing windows while children played at make-believe war . Across the street from number 562o Walterswood two men were busy waxing a car . Others were raking leaves and doing other autumn chores . About noon , a couple emerged from number 162o . The gray-haired man , who seemed to be in his 50 'S , was carrying a baby . The woman with him was a good-looking redhead about 20 years old . Together they strolled to their parked car . The woman went to the driver 's side , the man opened the door on @#  | the other side and placed the baby on the front seat . Then it happened . The two men polishing the car raced across the street , grabbed the man and pinned him against the side of the car . They pulled a revolver from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she tried to run from the car . This was the capture by FBI agents of Bobby " One-Eye " Wilcoxson , " the most wanted criminal since Dillinger , " and his girl friend , Jacqueline Rose . For almost a year , a contingent of the 6000 special FBI agents had worked virtually around the clock to track him down . Behind his capture lies a dramatic tale of perseverance , coincidence , and a mother 's determination to do what she believed was right for her daughter and granddaughter . This great manhunt was set off on December 15 , 1961 . About 9:30 that morning a man with a trenchcoat draped over his right shoulder entered the Lafayette National Bank 's branch at King 's Highway in Brooklyn , N.Y. , and mercilessly blasted the unsuspecting security officer , Henry Kraus , with four slugs from a machine gun concealed under the coat . Kraus slumped to the floor and died . The murderer covered terrified bank employes with his weapon while a Negro accomplice ran from cage to cage , scooping packets of bills into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and fled , with $34,000 . FBI investigation led to the identification of the robber as Bobby Randell Wilcoxson , already linked with two other bank robberies . His accomplices were believed to be two former prison mates , Peter Curry , the Negro , and Albert Nussbaum , described as perhaps the most cunning fugitive in the United States . Also with them , reportedly , was Wilcoxson 's blond girl friend , who had a six-month-old baby boy . She allegedly had driven the getaway car in one of the robberies . Curry was caught the following February 13 near his mother 's home in Brooklyn , and the hunt for the Wilcoxson mob intensified . Joining the FBI in the search were other law-enforcement agencies in the United States and abroad . Newspapers , radio and TV stations alerted the public through photographs , spot announcements and slides . Special alerts went out to hotels and motels , railways , air and bus lines , gas stations , garages , automobile dealers and car-rental companies . Thousands of physicians , pediatricians in particular , were notified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stomach ailment . In April 1962 the FBI asked The Reader 's Digest if it would be willing to alert its readers as it had in another " most wanted " case. * In  | July the magazine published the story ? " Most Wanted Criminal Since Dillinger " ? with pictures of Wilcoxson , Nussbaum and Jackie Rose ? and offered a $1o,000 reward " to the person or persons who supplied information leading to the capture of Bobby Wilcoxson . " Leads began to come in . At almost the same time Wilcoxson was " definitely " seen on the East Coast , the West Coast , in Mexico and Canada . At almost the same time he was reported to be residing in six foreign countries . The FBI painstakingly explored each report . A woman at a roadside restaurant in northern California saw a man answering Wilcoxson 's description . Her husband and a friend , both optometrists , agreed that the person she indicated had an artificial right eye , Wilcoxson 's most distinguishing feature . Had this woman made a collect phone call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net which would almost certainly have enabled them to question this suspect . But the woman wrote the FBI a letter , and the trail was several days cold before investigators heard about it . The trio simply dropped out of sight . Months passed without a definite clue as to the whereabouts of any of them . Then , around 9:15 p.m. on November 3 , 1962 , the phone rang in the Buffalo , N.Y. , home where Nussbaum 's attractive 25-year-old wife , Alicia , mother of a 19-month-old child , lived with her parents , Mr. and Mrs. Sylvester Majchrowicz . Mrs. Majchrowicz answered the call and recognized her son-in-law 's voice . He spoke briefly with Alicia and asked her to meet him somewhere in town . She departed immediately . This was the opportunity Mrs. Majchrowicz was waiting for . In a letter written to The Reader 's Digest last November , Mrs. Majchrowicz explained her motivation for what she did next . " In June of this year I purchased a copy of your magazine , " she wrote . " I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to furnish any and all information which came into my possession to the FBI . It was necessary for me to consider the future of my daughter and my grandchild . " What Mrs. Majchrowicz did was to pick up the phone and tell Buffalo Special Agent Harry Wynn that she suspected Nussbaum was in the city and that her daughter had just left to meet him . When Alicia returned home , FBI men were waiting . At first she denied seeing her husband but , persuaded by the agents and her mother that it was best for everyone concerned that he give himself up before he or some innocent persons were killed , she admitted that he had phoned . " He wanted to see me , " she said . " I took my father 's car , and I went to a certain pay phone . Al called me there and told me where to meet him . " They drove to Niagara Falls . Nussbaum had lost weight , had pl 66 THE READER 'S DIGEST February  | grown a mustache and had dyed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he no longer looked like the crew-cut young man on the FBI posters . But all the publicity had made him feel that , despite his disguise , he would be known anywhere . He said he was " tired of running . " They stopped at a restaurant but , since he was afraid of being recognized , she went in and brought out two cups of coffee . " They wo n't take me alive , " he told her ; he referred to some pills he said he had and which he said were poison . Alicia confided to the FBI that she was to meet Nussbaum again that night at 1:15 at the Statler Hilton Hotel in Buffalo . To save her husband 's life and " to stop the running , " she agreed to cooperate . Agents rushed to the meeting place . As his wife waited at the hotel entrance , Nussbaum approached in a blue Chevrolet . Seeing him , the distraught wife , as if she could stand the strain no longer , pressed her hands against her head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a danger signal and sped away . Three FBI cars gave chase . For 20 minutes Nussbaum raced through rain-slicked streets at speeds up to Too m.p.h. , ignoring red lights and dashing the wrong way down one-way streets . Turning a corner at one point , he lost sight of his pursuers long enough to park , turn off his lights and crouch down out of sight as they sped past . But before he could resume flight his parked car was spotted by agents . Guns drawn , they cautiously approached the blue Chevrolet . To their surprise , Nussbaum surrendered without a struggle , though  | lie had a .22-caliber rifle in the car and two live hand grenades in the pockets of his fatigue jacket . On the way to FBI headquarters , he suddenly became drowsy . Agents rushed him to Columbus Hospital , where a stomach pump foiled his attempt at suicide . He had swallowed Seconal , a sleeping tablet lethal in large doses . As he posed for his rogue 's gallery photos , this seemingly successful criminal , said to have participated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had to show for it only $2 in cash and three pawn tickets , one representing $3 obtained on his gold wedding ring . Nussbaum was tight-lipped under questioning , admitting to none of the charges against him . Unwittingly , however , he helped put investigators on the trail that led straight to Wilcoxson . Checking the Pennsylvania license plates and registration of Nussbaum 's car , they located an address in Philadelphia where Nussbaum had lived , posing as a science-fiction writer under the name Carl J. Fischer . Neighbors there recalled that a young woman with a baby carriage sometimes picked up Nussbaum 's mail when he was away . This was the closest the agents had been to Wilcoxson in ten months . They now blanketed the area , interviewing householders , and found a place where a couple and small child had lived until recently . They had given their names as Charles and Barbara Dix . FBI investigation determined that an automobile was registered by the fugitives under an alias , and intensive legwork traced their car to Baltimore , Md . Agents spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI agent working on this case lived on the same street , almost directly across from the couple . Their house , part of a duplex , was put under 24-hour surveillance . Neighbors had seen little of the new residents since they moved in on Halloween . The young woman 's hair was red , and the grayhaired man had a heavy black mustache , and wore horn-rimmed glasses . They assumed he was the girl 's father . Reasonably sure that the couple was Wilcoxson and Jacqueline , the FBI laid plans to capture them without endangering the baby or neighbors . Wilcoxson almost certainly had hand grenades , bombs , tear gas and machine guns in the house . The minute he learned of a trap he would use them . So they waited patiently until he came out . The FBI 's caution was amply justified . In the house and in the trunk of the car agents found revolvers , a submachine gun , a sawed-off shotgun , live hand grenades and ammunition . Especially useful for a man needing a quick getaway was a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car on the market . Wilcoxson bore little resemblance to the photographs circulated for his identification . The horn rims of his spectacles hid his eye defect . Besides  | graying his hair , he had shaved the front part of his scalp to look bald , then let his hair grow long in the back . He did , indeed , look old enough to be his paramour 's father . Lacking other leads , his pursuers might easily have failed to recognize him . Wilcoxson was also much better provided with cash than his partner , Nussbaum . A large suitcase was stuffed tight with packets of bills of every denomination ? over $21,000 in all . Wilcoxson 's interest in his " status " was shown by the fact that in the trunk of his car was a copy of the July Reader 's Digest , open at the article about himself , titled , " Most Wanted Criminal Since Dillinger . " Shortly after his arrest he said to his captors , " I have the greatest respect for the FBI . I knew you 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
