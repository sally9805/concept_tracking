The U.S. house party has taken to the skies . Time : between peak periods of the tourist rush to Europe . Place : charter flights across the North Atlantic . Guests of honor : thousands of Americans who might never visit the Continent without the organized buildup , the cheap fares ( average round trip : $265 ) , and the group security of the newest way to go abroad . In three years charter flights have grown 200% , now account for more than one in every ten passengers who fly the North Atlantic . This year charter flights will attract such diverse groups as Manhattan 's Cliff Dwellers Deviltry and Diversion Society , the New Glarus ( Wis . ) Yodlers , the Flatbush Bridge Club , members of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Neighborhood Cleaners Association ( New York City ) . For most charter travelers , the flight overseas will be an aisle-roaming , convivial carnival in the sky . Says Lois Raebeck , a member of Manhattan 's Lexington Democratic Club : " They sort of drink and feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really royal treatment . " <P> Although tourist travel accounts for the biggest share of charters , corporations are joining the fun . Next week Hupp 's Gibson Refrigerator Division of Greenville , Mich , will spend nearly $2,000,000 to charter 31 Pan American 707 jets to fly 5,080 dealers from 23 U.S. cities to Honolulu for a sales convention ; General Electric has chartered 17 jets for a similar junket this fall . All of the nation 's 16 major-league ball clubs now travel on chartered planes , and there are even charter runs to ferry monkeys and elephants from India , blooded Irish race horses to and from the U.S. for stud service . <P> Less Bother &; Bookkeeping . But the bulk of the charter flight boom reflects the growing U.S. passion for seeing new places . The airlines like charter flights because they keep equipment in use during the off season . The flights entail less bother and bookkeeping than regular flights , since an entire plane is chartered for a flat rate ( e.g. , $22,000 for a DC-7C seating 79 ) to a group that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seating . For the economy-minded traveler , charter flights offer the equivalent of first-class service ( meals include hors d'oeuvres , filet mignon , hard liquor , wine and champagne ) at less than half the price , and a chance to travel with - or meet-friends . With more and more regular passengers taking jets , airlines are able to use their prop planes on the charter runs . <P> Charter flights , of course , have their disadvantages . Flight dates are fixed and tickets are not changeable . In peak travel periods charter flights are hard to get , thus must usually be arranged twelve months in advance . Civil Aeronautics Board regulations for charter flights are strict . To qualify for an international air charter flight , an individual must have belonged to a club for more than six months , and the club must exist for a reason other than the charter flight . The CAB is usually tough about approving charter applications from club organizers and travel agents , sometimes cancels flights at the last minute if it suspects deceptions . Although wives and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not advertise the charter flight except in their own publications , can not make a profit from it .
