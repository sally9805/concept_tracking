MAYBE I 'LL PITCH FOREVER A DOUBLE-LENGTH ARTICLE Most of the players were already in the Cleveland Indians ' locker room when I got there for our baseball game with the Chicago White Sox on Friday night , August IA 1948 . The Indians 'd won seven in a row and had three straight shutouts . With that kind of luck , any player should be goose loose . But 01 ' Satchel Paige was n't . And for a guy who 'd already thrown in better than .. 2000 professional games , that funny feeling in my stomach was a mighty unusual thing . But this was a mighty unusual game for rne . First of all , even this early we already knew there 'd be more people out there than ever before at a major-league night game . And if I pitched a shutout , it would tic the American League team record of four shutouts in a row . I 'd been working up to this kind of a setup for a month , since Bill Veeck signed me about six weeks before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some liked to say I was forty-two going on forty-nine . Two days later I became the first Negro ever to pitch inthe American League and the fourth ever to play in the league . Since then I 'd won four and lost only one . In my last game I 'd shut out these same Chicago White Sox . But this was my real chance to show all those people who said I was too aid to be in the majors , who said I never really had the ability anyway . When they finished counting the crowd , there were 78,3142 there . It was all noise , like a dream . Nine innings later the fans were yelling the roof off the place . I 'd pitched the shutout . I 'd given up three hits , struck out five and walked one . In the locker room the baseball writers all headed for me . " Looks like you 're rookie of the year , Satch , " one of them said . Well , if I was , I was a little rusted up , You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the slums of Mobile , Alabama ; from hiding from truant officers and cops ; from reform school . And while I was coming all that way I guess I 'd been a lot of things people said I was  --  a no-good kid , a guy who left his team when the money looked bet-ter someplace else , a chaser . I 'd been those things , but I also 'd been a fine pitcher  --  one of the best ever . I was born July 7 , 1906 . After I hit the top those writers played guessing games with my age . I never put a stop to it , and my family and my buddies did n't help , because they kept giving different dates . But there 's a birth certificate in Mobile saying I was born July 7. l90 ' 4 . Now . I know it 's made out for a LeRoy Page , but my folks started out by spelling their name " Page " and later stuck in the " i " to make themselves sound more high-tone . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , 1906 , is it . Our place on South Franklin Street was called a " shotgun " house because the four rooms were one behind the other  --  just a straight shot from the front door to the back . I was the seventh of eleven children in that little shack . My dad , John , was a gardener , but he liked to be called a landscaper . My mom , Lula , who still was telling folks how to behave when she celebrated her ninety-sixth birthday in 1960 , was a washerwoman . Mom was a strict churchgoing woman . She was the boss of the house , not dad . He was n't hardly a part of my life . We did n't talk much , but after I started playing baseball as a kid he used to ask every so often , You want to be a baseball player ' stead of a landscaper ? " " Yes , " I 'd answer , and he 'd just nod , like he was satisfied . Those first few years I was no different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nigger kid . " l went around with the back of my shirt torn , a pair of raggedy pieces of trousers covering me . We played in the dirt because we did n't have toys . We threw rocks . There was n't anything else to throw . And we ran and chased around , whooping and hollering like crazy . Then we raced for the bay and washed the dirt off . Only we did n't go just anywhere on the bay  --  just to certain parts . The white man got all the rest . I did n't play all the time . Everybody got to work when there are thirteen mouths to stuff . By the time 1 was about six , all my older brothers and sisters had steady jobs  --  even Wilson . who was only about nine or ten . We all gave our money to mom so she could get food . 1 ca n't remember us ever missing a meal . We did n't always have a belly-busting dishful . but we had something . Mom made sure everybody got their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was about six or seven years old , but I did n't go too often . The first few times I missed , mom came looking for me . Finally she got kind of used to it . Fact was , she did n't put much store in book learning . It ended up so she did n't get nearly as mad when I missed school as when I did n't come home with any money for food from selling empty bottles . When I was still seven , mom decided that my bottle selling was n't enough , and that I had to get me a job somewhere to help out more . She remembered that some of the kids around the neighborhood worked down at the depot , toting bags and satchels . The next day I was down there dragging a bag , letting it bounce off the floor and off the sides of my legs . I got a dime for it We were n't going to be eating much better if I made only one dime at a time , so I got me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , three or four satchels together and carry them at one time . My invention was n't a smart-looking thing , but it upped my income . The other kids all laughed . " You look like a walking satchel tree , " one of them yelled . That 's ' when LeRoy Paige became no more and Satchel Paige took over . When spring came I got me some more work sweeping up at Eureka Gardens , a semipro baseball park . The Mobile Tigers , a Negro team , played there a lot . So I took up rock throwing . That 's when I first found out I had control . 1 t was a natural gift . I used to kill me flying birds with rocks . It did n't take me long to find out that rocks were good for something besides knocking over birds . They made a real impression on a kid 's head or backside . I had plenty of chances to use rocks that way too . Chester Arnold and Julius Andrews and my other buddies all were guys who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked trouble even better than me . Our biggest fights came on the way home from school . We went right by a white school , and a big gang from there always was out waiting for us . When we got close , the rocks started flying . I crippled up a lot of them , and I mean it . It got so had they had to put a policeman there . Maybe I got into all those lights because I was n't real smart and did n't take too good to books . But maybe it was because I found out what it was like to be a Negro in Mobile . Even if you 're only seven , eight or nine , it eats at you when you know you got nothing and ca n't get a dollar . The blood gets angry . Mom did n't take to my fighting . She 'd hit me harder than I ever got hit in a fight . I used to think she did n't know how I felt when they told me I could n't swim where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess she just learned to live with it . Since 1 threw those rocks so straight , I guess it was just natural that 1 started firing a baseball . By the time I was ten years old , I was throwing it harder than anybody in the neighborhood . When Wilbur Hines , the coach of the team for W. H. Council school , announced baseball tryouts that year 1 figured I was ready . Hines put me in the outfield , and sometimes let me play first base , until a game about halfway through the season . They 'd knocked two of our pitchers out of the box in the first inning , so he decided to try mc. 1 was all arms and legs then . When I let go of the ball I almost fell off the mound . But that ball whipped past three straight hatters for strike-outs . I kept pumping for eight more innings . When I was done I had struck out sixteen and had n't give up a hit . I soon became pretty well known all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw around there . Every day was a busy one for me . I worked at the ball park . I toted bags , I played baseball . But l always had time for trouble  --  that is , until one day in 1918 , a little after 1 turned twelve . I was walking by this toy store . stopped and went in . Unless you 've gone around with nothing , you do n't know how powerful a lure some new , shiny stuff is . When I thought no one was watching , I grabbed a handful of toy rings and stuffed them in my pocket . " Hey , what 're you doing ? " someone yelled . This big white man was coming down on me . He caught me by the front door . They dragged me down to police headquarters . Then they got mom , and even talked to the truant officer . They knew all about my playing hooky and being in trouble with those gang tights and rock throwing . They let me go home with my mom for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 191K , I was committed to the industrial school for Negro children at Mount Meigs , Alabama . A kid is too scared to think at first when they tear him away from his family and send him to a reformatory . After I was there it did n't seem too bad . Everybody was real kind to me . If I 'd been left on the streets of Mobile to wander with those kids I 'd been running around with , I 'd of ended up as a big bum , a crook . But Mount Meigs got me away from the bums . It gave me a chance to polish up my baseball game . It gave me some schooling I 'd of never taken if I was n't made to go to classes . It learned me how to pass time without getting into trouble . 1 know it may sound funny to talk about a reform school that way , but when you grow up as poor as me , a place like Mount Meigs can be mighty warm and good . They were real careful on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing , baseball playing , drawing , anything . I went out for baseball about a week after I got to the Mount . I started throwing . Nobody was hitting me . The coach told me afterward , " That arm may do you some good someday . Take care of it . You concentrate on baseball , and you might make something out of yourself . " I guess from that day on I was aiming at baseball , but it was n't the only thing I did , I went out for the choir , and soon I was the choir leader . And I made the drum and bugle corps , banging those drums . By the time I was fifteen or sixteen I 'd already grown to six feet three and a half inches . But 1 weighed only about 140 pounds , instead of 180 like later on . That tall , skinny look helped me out in pitching . My coach showed me how to kick up my foot so it looked like I 'd blacked out the sky . And he showed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I let go of the ball when my hand was right in my face . My coach also taught me how to watch a batter like a bullfighter watches a bull . I never look at a batter anywhere except at the knees , just like a bullfighter . The bullfighter can tell what a bull is going to do by watching his knees . I learned the same . When a batter swings and I see his knees move , I can tell just what his weaknesses are . Then I put the ball where I know he ca n't hit it . That teaching came in mighty handy later . You might say I traded live years or so of freedom to learn lheoawtnopitn the e mAt least started my real learning o I was seventeen and a half when they opened the door for me in December of 1923 . After I got home to Mobile , mom let me roam around for about a month or so getting used to things again . Then that came to an end . " It 's time you started helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better find you a piece of work . " The next day I went looking for work , but those who knew where I 'd been turned me down . Those who did n't know did n't seem to have any steady work . Or maybe I was n't really looking . One afternoon I ended up over at Eureka Gardens , where the semipro Mobile Tigers were getting ready for the 1924 season . My brother , Wilson , pitched and caught for them , but he was n't out that day . 1 sat down in the stands and leaned back to watch . After the regular practice the Tigers ' manager gave a kid pitcher a tryout . The manager cracked that kid 's pitches all over the park . When the kid walked off , 1 went up to the manager . " You still looking for a pitcher ? " I asked . Ten times I threw to him . Ten times he swung . Ten times he missed . " Do you throw that fast consistently ? " he asked me . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . That 's the day I learned a new word . The manager gave me a dollar and told me to conic back with Wilson for the next game . That dollar was the point where I gave up kids ' baseball  --  baseball just for fun  --  and started baseball as a career . Wilson and I were real tough for the Tigers . Actually Wilson could throw about as hard as 1 could , and we would have made one of the best two-man staffs you ever saw if he 'd stuck with baseball , but he did n't . First of all , he did n't want to leave Mobile . And Wilson did n't love baseball like me. 1 won just about all the games I pitched for the Tigers back there in 1924 . I 'd get about a buck a game when enough fans came out so we made sonic money . When there was n't enough money , they gave me a keg of lemonade . Sometimes 1 pitched for other teams . I jumped whenever there was some green waved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job , so I had to get some work too . I landed a job over at the Mobile Bears ' stadium . That was the white team , a Southern Association club . Pretty soon those guys over there started hearing about Or Satch . One day about four of them came up to me . " We made a bet you could n't throw as good as all of them say , " one of them told me . He offered me a dollar to show them . That 's the easiest dollar I ever made . The first guy up there swung at three fast ones  --  missed all . Another tried it . He just caused a breeze . " We sure could use you , " one of them finally told me . " If you were only white . . . . " That was the first time I heard it . I just pitched harder . The victories kept piling up for rne , and in 1926 they paid off . An old buddy . Alex Herman , who was managing the Chattanooga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at fifty dollars a month . My first game with the Black Lookouts was against New Orleans , who had a guy called Diamond throwing for them . It do n't make much difference who throws when 01 ' Satch 's in there . We won , l-0. 1 gave up two hits . Two days later Alex threw me again . I gave up only three hits , won again , struck out fourme , and I teen . Alex Hermanwatnusiaed o guess he taught me more'n anybody else . " The way you throw , " he said , " you ought to be able to get the ball over the plate every time , and I 'm gon na make sure you do . " The first thing he had me do was knock over pop bottles he 'd lined up by home plate . I got pretty good at that . Alex also had me throwing the ball through a hole in the fence no bigger than the inside of a man 's hat . It got so I could nip frosting off a cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that paid good money . By the time the season was a month old , I was making about $100 a month . Alex Herman kept as close tab of me off the field as he did on . We got to be pretty close buddies . Dancing was the big thing with us . We 'd hunt up a couple of dolls and off we 'd go  --  doing the shuffle , trots , waltzes , anything . It kept my legs in shape , but it did n't do much for my sleeping . Those moonshiners liked us too . I guess I was living it up pretty high . I 'd never had any money to do it before . By the time I finished my second year with Chattanooga , 1 was busting around in a flashy roadster that could really scoot . That car and my pitching record were all I had when the Birmingham Black Barons bought me from the Black Lookouts in 1928 and gave me a contract for 5275 a month . Birmingham showed me a new world of baseball . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching Alex Herman had given me , and I got a catcher , George Perkins , who was one of the best ballplayers of all time  --  Negro or white . I guess I was pretty confident . In my first ball game with Birmingham I even thought of calling in my outfield like Alex and I 'd done at Chattanooga , to build up the crowds . But I did n't think Bill Gatewood would put up with it . Then I hit on another gimmick . I yelled over to the other team , " I 'm gon na strike out the first six guys up against me . " You should have seen those guys burn . They shook their bats at me . Well , after I 'd struck out the first five , one of the guys on their bench pulled out a white towel and waved it back and forth . The sixth batter came up , and I grinned at him and threw quick . He popped out . George Perkins cornered me at the bench . " You did n't get those six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " They 'd already surrendered , " I told him . " When Of Satch needs a strike-out , he gets it . " After the 1929 season at Birmingham a guy named Sefior Linares from Santa Clara in Cuba called me and said they were getting up some teams down that way and he wanted me to pitch for them . He waved plenty of green in my face , and I was packed before he got his hat back on . When I got there they put me in the best hotel I 'd ever stayed in . " Man , this is the life , " I told everybody . No winter , no cold weather , just nice , warm breezes . After that first season of winter ball in 1929 , I played year-round baseball every year until 1958 . Those people in Latin America like you real good if you can throw hard . But I also found out they take their baseball pretty hard . One year down in Venezuela a bunch of soldiers had to march me out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to carve me up because I lost a ball game  --  even though an error cost me the game . And down in Puerto Rico I once won twenty-three games in a row and then lost one , about 1-0 , and everybody said I must have been drunk . When I came back from that first swing in ( he islands , I joined Tom Wilson and his Nashville Elite Giants . Before long Tom moved the club up to Cleveland . All season we played in the shadow of the Cleveland Indians ' park . That was where the big money was . That was where major-leaguers made 580,000 a year , like Babe Ruth . " Babe Ruth 's getting up a barnstorming team of major-leaguers , " Tom told me near the end of the season . " What 's that mean to me ? " I asked . " He 's gon na play against the Baltimore Black Sox . They want you to pitch for ( hem . " The first time the two clubs met I beat the Babe Ruth Ali-Stars easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hack came up to me after the game , " That was some pitching , " he said . " It looked like you were throwing a pea . " Babe Ruth was n't in the line-up that day . During the whole tour I never pitched against him . When I was pitching , he was bench-managing , and when I was getting a day off , he was playing . The 1931 season did n't last long for the Elite Giants . We hardly got started when the club busted up . That turned out to be a break for me . I ended up on another club , and it was about the best team ever put together in any country  --  the best team , Negro or white . That was Gus Greenlee 's Pittsburgh Crawfords . Gus had a real good thing in Pittsburgh in 1931 . He had a restaurant , a boxing stable , the ball club and Josh Gibson , the world 's greatest catcher and hitter  --  Josh could have hit more home runs than Babe Ruth if they 'd let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , Gus came busting over . " We 're gon na open against the Homestead Grays , " he said . " They 're the best there is , Satch . " I beat the Grays without any trouble , and struck out sixteen . We celebrated after that game . Gus just locked the door on his Crawford Grill and we went to town . People mobbed me like money 'd rub off if they touched me . But one of the waitresses stood off a little . She acted kind of like she was bashful . I pushed away from the other gals and headed over to her . " ' Lo . I 'm Satch . " " I knew you , all right , Mr. Paige . Everybody knows you now . I 'm Janet Howard . " She was all big eyes for me . I could tell that . What I did n't know was that , then and there , she was starting to write the end of my bachelor days . Right after that game Gus Greenlee raised me from $250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of 1931 . There always was a mob around when 1 tossed . Those fans were seeing top baseball  --  baseball like only guys like Josh Gibson could play . He was n't just a slugger . He was a high-average man too . If I had to rate top hitters , I 'd put him ahead of Ted Williams of Boston . Joe DiMaggio of New York and Stan Musial of St. Louis . Right behind them I 'd put Chainey White , who played with the Homestead Grays . Josh Gibson and I were such big guns on that 1931 club that Gus Greenlee started advertising us instead of the Crawfords . Gus began giving me top billing , with Josh second , The others were n't getting hardly any billing . That caused some guys to get jealous . But there was one thing for sure . Before 1 started cutting loose around Pittsburgh in 1931 , there was no big money for anybody in the Negro leagues . Then they started getting nice , fat checks . I got the fans out . Gus Greenlee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pitch for the Crawfords . He knew just how to book so I 'd make plenty . When Gus did n't have me playing somewhere , I did some fishing and shooting . I guess I had me ten , fifteen shotguns . It was mighty nice having those big pay checks so I could buy those beauties . I also took a shine to boxing , and I got friendly with the guys at Gus 's gym , my favorite hangout . No matter where I went , I always ended up back in Pittsburgh . That was where Janet Howard was . She was always glad to see me , but she did n't like my being out of town all those times and my going down to the islands in the winters . Finally , in the summer of 1934 , Janet and me sat down to talk about getting married . " Satchel , we ca n't keep running around like you were just my guy and nothing else , " she told me . " Now you just make up your mind about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gone ? You get mad now when I am . What 're you gon na be doin ' when we 're married up ? " " We 'll manage . " Our wedding day was October 26 , 1934 . I 've been trying to forget that date for a long time now . We made a mistake , and we did n't find out until it was too late . After the honeymoon I started noticing a powerful lightness in my hip pocket . Those pay checks of mine just were n't going as far as they used to . " I 'll see Gus , " I said . " He 'll give us more money . " But he turned me down flat . I was so mad I went home and started throwing clothes into a suitcase . " Where 're we going ? " Janet asked me . " I do n't know . We 're just goin ' . " I was n't stuck for an answer too tong . A guy named Neil Churchill , who ran a car agency in Bismarck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sponsored a club in Bismarck , and he wanted a top pitcher to finish out the 1934 season . For the first time since I 'd started throwing I was going to have some white boys on my side . For a while I got a pretty cold shoulder . Mr. Churchill wanted me , but those white ballplayers were n't too sure they did . But when they saw me pitch , they wanted me more than anybody . After the Bismarck season ended , Janet and me headed toward the West Coast . I was going to play gainst Dizzy Dean and his all-stars . They were saying Diz and me were about as alike as two tadpoles . We were both fast and slick . But Diz was in the majors , and I was bouncing around the peanut circuit . By the time we finished up playing each other , old Diz and I 'd pitched in six games and I 'd won four of them . When we was saying good-by , Diz came up to me and said , " You 're a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess Diz meant it , because later on he had a whole bunch more nice things to say in a column he was writing in a Chicago paper . Because I 'd jumped out on my contract and gone to Bismarck in 1934 , Gus Greenlee got the Negro leagues to ban me for the 1935 season . I just got hold of Mr. Churchill and went back to work for him . That summer I got to know a bunch of Indians around Bismarck real well . I think they were Sioux or something . They took a real liking to me . They even gave me some snake oil , and it 's kept my arm nice and young . The formula is a secret . I promised those Indians I would n't tell it , but I guess I 'll put it in my will so folks will have it when I got no more need for it . That Bismarck team of mine won the first national semipro tournament . I took four games , struck out sixty and was voted the most valuable player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be nice to me again . They wanted those fans I could pull . " We 've lifted the ban on you , " Gus Greenlee told me . " When can you rejoin the team ? " When I acted happy about settling down in Pittsburgh again , Janet and me started hitting it off better than we had for months . But then I got a fat offer to pitch down in Puerto Rico before the Craw-fords started their season . " They ai n't letting us take wives , " I told Janet . She did n't like it . But 1 went anyway . When I got back she really lit into me . It was all over , that feeling we once had . 1 was glad to get away . At the tag end of 19361 hooked up with an all-star team that was booked against some tough major-leaguers . One was Bob Feller . Bobby and me became good friends later on when we were teammates at Cleveland , but then he was just a seventeen-year-old kid who 'd finished up his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boys , 4-2 . Bob and me came out about nose to nose in the three innings we pitched . Bob struck out eight , and we got only a scratch hit off him . 1 gave up only one hit , too , and struck out . seven . In those days I guess I only thought of Number One . I jumped the Crawfords early in 1937 to play a series of games in the Dominican Republic , and I jumped again to Mexico before the season was over . That burned Gus Greenlee up . He traded off my contract to the Newark Eagles . In the meantime , everywhere I went in Mexico I ran into Negro-league players . But I was n't enjoying it there like I should have . I had trouble getting the kinds of food I needed , and my stomach miseries , which first hit me when I was in Venezuela in 1934 , started up on me . Pretty soon every part of me was hurting , even my arm . But because I was getting paid by the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about ended my career . One morning when I woke and sat up . my stomach got worse with the pain that shot up my right arm . Sweat popped out all over me. 1 tried lifting my arm . I could n't . They got about every doctor they had in Mexico City to look at me . They could n't do anything for me . Neither could the doctors back in the States . Finally one specialist told me , " Satchel , I do n't think you 'll ever pitch again . " When you been at the top and hit the bottom , it 's a mighty long fall . By the time the winter meeting of the Negro leagues came around , I saw nothing ahead of me . Then about halfway through the meetings I got a call from J. L. Wilkinson , the owner of the Kansas City Monarchs . He said he and his partner , Sam Baird , had bought my contract from the Newark Eagles . They offered me a job playing first base with a B team the Monarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how it will be , " I said . " But if 1 ai n't good enough for the Monarchs themselves , why 're you givin ' me this job ? " Mr. Wilkinson was quiet for a minute . " We think you 're still big enough to pull the fans , " he said . " Anyway , I thought you need a hand . " With the Monarch traveling team I was still pulling sonic fans , but to the boys on the club 1 was just the old man without an arm any more . I could throw the ball again , sure , but about all I could do was gel it up to the plate or play first . And you do n't win hall games with just a weak first baseman 's arm . The manager , Knot Joseph , a real old-timer , kept trying to perk me up . " Go throw that ball sonic , " he 'd ... say . 1 kept pitching , one and two innings at a time . Then I 'd take my aching arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot . One day I went out to toss a couple of warmups before a game . I motioned to my catcher and threw . There was n't any pain . I 'd been expecting it , so that when it did n't come , it was like a bomb going off . I threw again . There still was n't any pain . Then I tried a fast ball . It was a miracle , but my arm was alive . We called Mr. Wilkinson that night and told him . He said I should work myself back into shape real easy , and then join the Monarchs for the 1939 season . I really hit the peak of the mountain with the Monarchs in 1939.1 was making S20,000 , maybe even 322,000 a year . After the Crawfords kind of busted up , the old Washington Homestead Grays 'd become the big team in the Negro leagues again , and they 'd won the Negro National League title in 1937 , 1938 and 1939 . In fact , they went ahead and won it in 1940 , 1941 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad dream , I started making the Monarchs the big name . I pitched them to the Negro American League title in 1939 , and after that we racked up the championship in 1940 , 1941 and 1942 ? just like the Grays . The folks in Kansas City treated me like a king , and you never saw a king of the walk if you did n't see 01 ' Satch around Eighteenth and Vine in those days . One night early in the 1942 season I stopped by a drugstore to get me some camera film . This nice-looking gal came up to wait on me . I could tell right off that she did n't know who I was . That kind of bothered me . " You got some one-twenty film ? " I asked her real polite . " We do n't have any one-twenty left in stock , " she said . " Could you use something else ? " That boiled me over . First , she did n't know me , and now she was asking me if I could use any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carrying around my neck would n't take anything but one-twenty . " No . Just one-twenty , " I snapped . " Well , do n't act so smart . It 's just a twenty-three-dollar camera you got there , ' cause I got one just like it . " I guess when you 're playing the peacock and somebody pulls a feather , you gel a lot madder than when you ai n't playing . I yelled for the manager , and he was really upset . " Mr. Paige , if Miss Brown insulted you , we 'll fire her right now , " he said . " You just say the word . " Even as big a man as I thought I was those days , I did n't want anything like that happening , not to a gal who was as fine a looker as that Miss Brown . " No , sir . You do n't have to fire anyone . But maybe she 'll have some manners after this . " Well , the next day I could n't wait until I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ? " I asked a clerk by the door . I said it loud enough so Miss Brown could hear it . She did , and came up and waited on me . Every couple of days I 'd go back to the drugstore and ask for that half-smart girl . Finally I went up to her one night when there were n't any customers around . " What 's your first name ? " 1 asked . " Lahoma , " she said . " Well , Lahoma , because you 're so smart , I 'd just like to have dinner with you . " " I 'd like to have dinner with you too , " she said . That was the first date I had with Lahoma . We had plenty more . In 1943 my first wife , Janet , divorced me on the grounds of desertion . All I could think about was that now there was n't anything blocking me from seeing Lahoma all 1 wanted . The next time 1 was in Kansas City after that I raced that buggy of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best girl , I 'll be your best boy , " I finally blurted out . That was n't what I 'd wanted to say , but I 'd said at least that much . " You know I will , Satchel , " she told me . Lahoma was from Stillwater , Oklahoma . She 'd been married before , too , and she had her a little girl named Shirley Long . Shirley was about three in 1943 . The war was on then . I 'd registered for the draft like everybody else , and moved my birth date up to September , 1908 , instead of July , 1906 ; but they never called me . So 1 helped sell war bonds and visited camps and hospitals . Toward the end of the war rumors were flying around about getting some colored boys in the major leagues . Well , I 'd been hearing about the white boys scouting colored ballplayers for twenty years , but 1 did n't see any of them playing in the major leagues . 1 thought there never would be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out on the West Coast in October of 1945 . Branch Rickey told the world he 'd signed Jackie Robinson of the Monarchs and assigned him to the Montreal Royals of the International League . Almost twenty years after I fired my first " trouble ball ' as a full-time professional , Jim Crow got busted on the nose . The colored ballplayer 'd made his first dent in organized baseball . But it had n't happened to me . Maybe everybody figured I was too old . Anyway , those major-league owners knew 1 would n't start out with any minor-league team like Jackie was . They 'd have had to put me right in the majors , I kept saying to myself . But signing Jackie like they did still hurt me deep down . I 'd been the one the white boys wanted to barnstorm against . I 'd been the one everybody said should be in the majors . When you hurt like I was hurting , you go hunting for someone to ease that hurt . There was only one person who could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole winter everybody kept writing about Jackie and how great it was . It almost seemed like they 'd forgotten teams 01 ha'd n't Satch. forgotten But the me barnstorm. there and ing were as many jobs as I 'd ever had . Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Baird , the owners of the Monarchs , were happy to sec a colored ballplayer gel ahead . But they were burned up at the way it 'd happened . The Dodgers just took Jackie away from them without giving them anything for him . And Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Baird were afraid if other major-league teams did that , too , it 'd kill off Negro baseball . They were right . Mr. Wilkinson , Mr. Baird and me and a lot of others could see the handwriting in 1945 . But it took a few more years before it really got bad . By the time the 1946 season opened , everybody in baseball was sitting tense to see how Jackie worked out . He did n't let anybody down . I would n't put him on my all-time great team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I gave those reporters plenty to write about in 1946 too . I was still throwing lightning , and it struck down a lot of teams , enough to make it pretty easy for the Monarchs to win the first- and second-half championships in our league , Throughout the rest of 1946 and into 1947 I kept thinking I 'd get a bite from the major leagues . But I did n't even have anybody snap . I promised myself I 'd keep throwing until somebody figured they needed me bad . Lahoma made sure I kept thinking that way too . A man just ca n't let a gal who takes care of him like that get away . And the only way to make sure a gal does n't get away is to marry her . I did , on October 12 , 1947 , in Hays , Kansas . You talk about the best things you 've ever done . Man , when you get somebody like Lahoma in your corner , you can win them all . She gave me that settled-down life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I ai n't always thinking about them , no matter how I act . When we had our first baby , it really staggered 01 ' Satch . By the time we had our second child , I was a pretty old hand at babies . Now we have six children . Five of them are girls . In 1952 1 had me a son , Robert LeRoy . He 's built just like me . I do n't know for sure if he will be a pitcher . A daddy likes to think his boy is going to be what he is , but he never knows , By 1948 1 was n't making as much as before because attendance at Negro-league games was going down . Then it happened  --  one day I got a letter from Abe Saperstein , the guy who runs the Harlem Globetrotters . Bill Veeck , who headed up the Cleveland Indians , had asked Abe to scout around for some pitching help . Abe recommended me to the Indians , and Mr. Veeck wanted me to come up for a tryout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? my forty-second birthday . When I got out on the field , Lou Boudreau was there in his uniform . Mr. Veeck and Abe Saperstein were there too . " Can you still throw like you used to ? " Mr. Lou asked me . " I got as fast a ball as anybody pitchin ' now , but I got to admit it 's not half as fast as it used to be . But I can still pitch it where I want to . " Mr. Lou got him a catcher 's mitt and went behind the plate . I just tossed a couple real easy , and then I started firing Finally Mr. Lou told me I 'd thrown enough . " That 's some control , Satch , " he told me . " You did n't miss the strike zone more'n four times out of fifty . Let 's see if you can do that good when I try hitting against you now . " " You want me to shag the balls , Lou ? " Mr. Lou answered . M.r .. IrVyeecook idwsaant. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After seeing Satch 's stuff , I do n't think I 'm going to pull many balls to left . " He did n't , either . After we were done , he told me to go on in the clubhouse . A few minutes later Mr. Veeek same in . " Lou thinks you can help the club , " he told me . " Let 's go down to the office and sign a contract . " I could n't help thinking that Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Baird of the Monarchs ought to get something . They 'd sponsored me ever since my arni 'd gone dead . I told Mr. Veeck how 1 fell , and he agreed . He gave Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Baird 55000 to split . That was 55000 more than Branch Rickey gave them for Jackie Robinson when he took him from the Monarchs . At first I was used in relief . I pitched eighteen innings , spread over eight games , and alloyed only four earned runs . Then began getting some starts . I told you at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring my record up to five and one . You could feel that pennant tension every time you went into our locker room the last few days in August . I got a chance to help out on August thirtieth . We 'd dropped two games behind the Boston Red Sox and we were in third place when Mr. Lou sent me in there . 1 stopped the Washington Senators on seven hits . Boston was idle that night , and we were only one and a half games out of first place . That pennant race kept going like that right up to the wire . Then it ended with us and Boston tied for first place . They set a play-off game , and Gene Bearden went out and won it for us . Now 1 stood a chance of satisfying another ambition  --  playing in a World Series . That was up to Mr. Lou , but the way I 'd thrown for him , winning six games and losing only one down the stretch , 1 was sure he 'd use me against the National League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We won the Series in six games , but he did n't put me in until the seventh inning of the fifth game , after we got behind , 11-5 . There was a man on first and only one out . I guess everybody figured the game was over  --  and that turned out to be true  --  but I was mighty serious . Warren Spahn was up . 1 got him out of there . Then Tommy Holmes came up . I started my delivery to Tommy and reached way up high , then brought my hands down against my chest and rested a moment . That was all legal , but Curly Grieve , one of the umpires , ran out . " Balk , balk , " he yelled . " You wiggled the fingers of your glove . It 's a balk . " They moved Eddie Stanky , the runner on first , down to second . I did n't have anything to say . But it made me so mad I gave Tommy Holmes my real trouble ball and got him out quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that . I 'd pitched only two thirds of an inning . But it was the first a colored boy 'd ever pitched in a World Series . I did n't even feel mad at Mr. Lou any more . After the World Series I barnstormed for a while . Finally I got home to Kansas City for a few days ' rest . Lahoma kept me busy fixing things around the house , but I still had plenty of time for fishing and hunting and dancing . Doing that kept me in shape between seasons , especially that dancing . ' Course , there were a lot of other things I did to keep going . Some sports guy on the East Coast heard me talking about them once , and then he went and turned them into a bunch of rules from me on how to stay young : Avoid fried meats which angry up the blood . If your stomach disputes you , lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts . Keep the juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move . Go very light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the social ramble ai n't restful . Avoid running at all times . And do n't look hack . Something might be gaining on you . That last one was my real rule . When you look hack , you know how long you 've been going , and that just might stop you from going any farther . And with mc , there was an awful lot to look hack on . So 1 did n't . In 1949 1 had troubles . My stomach kept coming up and hitting me like it had n't since my arm went dead . The Indians used me a lot through June and July , and by August seventh I had me four wins and five losses . But then it got so I could n't go more than two or three innings at a time . 1 could n't win another game , and I had two more losses . After the season I went to see the doctor . He told me my teeth were in pretty had shape . He sent me to a dentist . " They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dentist said . 1 did n't like that idea at all , but the dentist was sure it 'd help my stomach . And it did , once my mouth healed and I got used to my store teeth . I was ready for 1950 . But Mr. Veeck had left the Indians . First they offered me a contract calling for 25 per cent less than the 525,000 I 'd been getting , and then Hank Greenberg . who 'd become general manager , told me Lou Boudreau said he could n't use me at all . Mr. Wilkinson , who 'd sold out his share of the Monarchs , said he 'd see what he could do about hooking me independent . He got guys like Eddie Gottlieb , of Philadelphia . and Abe Saperstein , who were a couple of good promoters , to help him . Offers started coming in fast . In the meantime Mr. Veeck told me not to worry . " I 'll he back in baseball soon , Satch , " he said . " And when I am , there 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July , 1951 , after I 'd turned down offers from the Giants and Braves . Mr. Veeck bought the St. Louis Browns . He told me to come up to St. Louis and join the team . In those two months I pitched for the Browns in 1951 I won three and lost only four with that last-place ball club . And I struck out forty-eight in sixty-two innings . I got along with the Browns real good too . They were a fine hunch , even if they were last-placers . The best one to go to for advice was Ned Garver . When I got to the Browns , Ned was on his way to winning twenty games . Next to me , he knew more baseball than just about any pitcher in the American League . Those first few weeks he told me about all the new guys in the league , and what they hit and what they did n't . He was right . I did n't joke with Ned too much ; he was a real serious boy . But one day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ned asked me what was the best relief job I 'd ever done . " That was before I got into pro ball , " I told him . " We were in the ninth and was leading , one to nothin ' . The first man up topped the ball and beat the throw . The second man hunted , and it looked like it was going foul , but it did n't , Then the third man up walked . Our pitcher had the fourth guy three halls and two strikes , and my manager called on me . " " What happened ? " Ned asked . " Well , I had a ball with me in the dugout , and 1 just dropped it in my pocket . Then I got the game ball from the pitcher 1 was relieving . When I went hack to the rosin bag , I got that other ball out of my pocket and had me two of them . " " Yeah ? What 'd you do then ? " " I just threw those two balls at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . I picked off both runners , and my motion was so good the batter fanned . That was three outs . " Ned would n't talk to me for a whole day after that . In 1952 I came on in the eighth inning one time in Washington and pitched ten innings of scoreless ball in relief . After that game Rocky Harris , the Washington manager , came over to see me . " Satch , " he said , " I swear to God we would be in first place if we had you . " He was n't the only one talking like that . Casey Stengel , who did some right fair managing for the New York Yankees , was another . " If the Yanks do n't get ahead in the first six innings , " he said , " the Browns bring in that damned old man , and then we 're sunk . " When the season ended I had a 12-10 record , and I 'd saved ten other games with those seventh-place Browns . I 'd struck out ninety-one batters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 3.07 . But 1953 was different . I had no arm soreness , but no matter how much I looked around that season , I just could n't find those wins . I finished up with a three-and-nine record , the worst I 'd ever had . Before the 1954 season even started , there were n't any Browns any more . They were sold , and the American League let the new owners move the club to Balti more . The The a new youth bosses movement told me and they diweredner , t e starting have room for an old man like me . So I joined Abe Saperstein 's barnstorming club . I was making money , but I was just a wandering man again , going from one town to another , one game to another . I did the same thing in 1955 , this time with my old team , the Kansas City Monarchs . Playing for the Monarchs in 1955 would n't make any man rich . There just were n't enough fans watching Negro-league baseball any more so the players could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board in 1956 . Bill Veeck had got himself the vice president 's job on the Miami Marlins in the International League , and he gave me that old call . Ihad me a steady job again , a good salary and a place to light my family when school in Kansas City was over . I finished up the season with eleven wins and only four losses , and an earned-run average of 1.86 . That ai n't bad when a man 's pushed past fifty . Mr. Veeck 'd pulled out of Miami after the 1956 season , and I was sorry . But in 1957 I won ten and lost eight there with a club that won only about half of its games . I had me a 2.42 earned-run average too . In 1958 , although my pitching was still strong , I did n't get along with the new Miami bosses , with Mr. Veeck gone . " I wo n't go back there next year , that 's for sure , " I told Lahoma after the season . " But , Satch , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " We 'll do something . There 're still plenty that want to see 01 ' Satch . " Things started breaking my way right after that . I was offered a movie job . On September thirtieth I signed for a role in The Wonderful Country , with Robert Mitchum and Julie London in it . They made that movie in Durango , Mexico . The whole family went along with me . Julie London and Robert Mitchum were real helpful in telling me how I should play the part of a cavalry sergeant in that Western . Right after we started shooting , my director , Bob Parrish , came up and told mc , " Satch , you 're batting seven-fifty in those rushes we 've got so far . When the word gets around Hollywood I think you 're going to be very much in demand . It would n't surprise me if you never played baseball again . " It turned out he was wrong . After I finished up that movie I went back to Kansas City . Nobody from Hollywood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do now ? " Lahoma wanted to know . " Play baseball , just like always . There ai n't anything else . " So , at fifty-three , I hooked up with a barnstorming club again . They say if you go long enough in one direction you 'll make a circle and end up where you started . I guess you do . Only there was a difference . I was n't a nigger kid in Mobile any more , playing for a jug of lemonade or almost starving . Now I was a big man , and I was getting big money . Someday it 'll end , maybe even before ! figure it will . 1 wo n't be able to just retire when that happens . Me and money has parted so fast all along that I 'll have to keep looking for more of it  --  enough to take care of my family . But 01 ' Satch ai n't worried . There 's bound to be people who 'll want a man who 's done what I 've done , who 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D I 'll just keep pitching  --  maybe forever . Some folks say I already have .
