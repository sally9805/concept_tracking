French schoolchildren , who have long quaked at their formidable baccalaurat exam , last week were faced with an even worse fate-no exams . Demanding an $80 million raise , France 's 325,000 teachers threatened to suspend next summer 's bachots . For 180,000 lycee students , no bachot meant no entrance to universities , no draft deferment-and , for men , a possible call to Algeria . <P> What incited the teachers was the government 's earmarking of $40 million-$60 million to pay 30,000 teachers in Catholic parochial schools-while it offered public school teachers only a $32 million raise . By such tactics as refusing to mark report cards , the fiercely anticlerical teachers have focused attention on decrepit buildings , overcrowded classrooms and minuscule salaries ( even in costly Paris , a $200 monthly top for grade-school teachers ) . <P> France is so short of teachers who will accept such conditions that Education Minister Lucien Paye last week upped his ante to $60 million , got a " postponement " of the exam strike . But the teachers may yet sabotage exams . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said one . " But there is n't $80 million in the treasury to pay teachers decently . Ah , the glory of France !
