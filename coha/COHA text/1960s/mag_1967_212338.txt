Brazil 's Catholic Church has never , as a whole , been known for opposition to the government . Some members of the church 's liberal wing have split off from the rest of the clergy and , in defiance of stiff laws , helped organize labor syndicates , defended student rights and sharp ened public feeling against the country 's army . But last week the Brazilian clergy , liberal and conservative alike , angrily rose up in unison . It issued a warning that it would take no nonsense from the army and , moreover , that it intended to exert its influence on the course of government policy . <P> The incident that sent the church into opposition occurred in the steelmaking town of Volta Redonda , after four university students had borrowed Bishop Waldir Calheiros ' station wagon to distribute antigovernment pamphlets . A few hours later , eight tommy-gun-toting soldiers broke into Dom Waldir 's home , searched his belongings and threatened to arrest him as a subversive . When a local radio station canceled a Catholic program and read an army-composed editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had printed a new list of Brazil 's " seven capital sins , " which included low salaries , unemployment , hunger , social castes and disease . The army confiscated all copies and arrested two priests who were distributing them . <P> A Call for Courage . This affair , coming after a long series of army arrests and harassment of the clergy , moved the central committee of the Brazilian Conference of Bishops to action . After a three-day meeting of its 22 bishops in Rio de Janeiro , it issued a statement warning the government that it had no right to " define and limit " church functions . " The present situation must be faced courageously , " said the bishops . <P> " The injustices brought up must be fought and defeated . Development demands profound innovation and audacious change . Urgent reforms must be carried out without delay . " <P> Then the bishops solidly aligned themselves with Brazil 's youth . " If this is the hour of the young , " they said , " then let us not be late to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward a future that is promising for Brazil . " Even " at the cost of personal hardships and sorrow , " the bishops concluded , they were willing to " sacrifice our lives " for their people . <P> President Arthur Costa e Silva , 65 , the army general who has been in office for nine months , did not quite know what to say . A staunch and faithful Catholic , he has visited Pope Paul twice in the past three years . To help arrange a truce , Costa asked to meet with the church 's leading bishops some time next month . He realizes all too well that it was the wrath of the Catholic Church that helped topple Argen tine Dictator Juan Peron in 1955.
