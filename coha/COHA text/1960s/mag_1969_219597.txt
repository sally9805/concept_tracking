Considering the sad record of the past , the idea of a good German ballet troupe might seem as implausible as a Nepalese surfing club . Times have definitely changed . Not long after the curtain lifted at the American debut of the Stuttgart Ballet last week , the audience at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House was cheering in disbelief at the light-as-air elegance of a pack of young gazelles from the edge of the Black Forest . <P> Although the Stuttgart Ballet ( formal name : the Wlirttemberg State Theater Ballet ) is German mainly through accident of residence , its accomplishments have become as strong a source of pride to its city as the Mercedes and Porsche automobile works located there . Like most major German cities , Stuttgart ( pop . 650,000 ) had long maintained an opera house , with a resident but minimal ballet company to help out where needed . In 1960 John Cranko , then a 33-year-old South Africa-born staff choreographer of the Royal Ballet , staged Benjamin Britten 's The Prince of the Pagodas in Stuttgart . He was immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company of international quality . <P> Limitless Variety . Cranko has gone the mandate one better . He has given Stuttgart not only a superbly knit , brilliant young company but has also played on his dancers ' strengths to form a style that is like none other . At any given moment in a typical Cranko ballet , the stage bristles with a seemingly limitless variety of movement . Instead of bloodless , assembly-line precision , the Stuttgart 's 38-member corps is more apt to suggest a 38-ring circus , with a panoply of gesture and stance that dazzles the viewer 's eye . <P> Cranko 's work is at its best in extended ballets with strong dramatic substance . Opening the company 's three-week New York visit was one of his best , an evening-long interpretation of Pushkin 's intensely romantic verse-drama Eugene Onegin . Two nights later , the company presented an even more stunning tour deforce , a balletic version of Shakespeare 's Taming of the Shrew . Both were lavishly mounted , eye-filling pieces . Onegin uses a score by Music Director Kurt-Heinz Stolze based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assuredly through Pushkin 's tale of romance and betrayal , never assuming the luxury of a dance-for-dance's-sake diversion , bending every movement toward dramatic ends . Shrew , with music by Domenico Scarlatti arranged by Stolze and liberally peppered by his modern harmonies , adds a welcome touch of wit and tenderness to Shakespeare 's buffoonery . <P> Both works featured the company 's prima ballerina , Brazilian-born Marcia Haydee , 29 , a dancer of stunning technique with the rare ability to turn the simplest body movement into a full statement . Touchingly simple as the lovelorn Russian girl who draws strength from rejection , deliciously rambunctious as Shakespeare 's ultimately tamed volcano , Haydee is to the dance what Maria Callas has been to opera . She is an artist incapable of a dull or empty gesture , able to communicate a state of mind through an impressive range of movement or even by standing still . Her frequent partner is California-born Richard Cragun , 24 , a bravura but seemingly effortless soloist who within a very few years may be the world 's finest male dancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
