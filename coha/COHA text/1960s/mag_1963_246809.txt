What role should the church play in the bitter fight for Negro equality in schools ? In Atlanta last week , the question was very much in the public eye as pickets bearing anti-segregation placards marched outside the fashionable , privately run Lovett School . It was a kind of civil rights protest that the South has grown used to - except that this time the pickets included Episcopal priests , and their protests were aimed at a school with Episcopal ties . <P> The pickets were objecting to Lovett 's whites-only admission policy , which pits the practice of some wealthy supporters of the church squarely against the desegregationist preaching of their bishops . Atlanta 's crusading Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , a Baptist , raised the issue last February , when he asked the school to admit his son . The school said no to him , and later to two Negro children from Episcopal families . The ground for rejection was purely racial , and the arguments have been echoing across Atlanta ever since . <P> Communion Every Wednesday . Lovett 's trustees obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school is , technically , an autonomous corporation without church affiliation . But in fact , 14 of Lovett 's 21 trustees are required to be Episcopal communicants ; their chairman is the dean of St. Philip 's Cathedral ; and , in keeping with the school 's chartered purpose of furthering religion in accordance with " the Episcopal faith as contained in the Book of Common Prayer , " Holy Communion is celebrated by the dean each Wednesday morning for the student body . <P> <P> This was connection enough for Lovett 's headmaster , the Rev. James McDowell . He promptly resigned , saying , " The church has spoken on the matter of segregation , and it is my duty , so long as I am a priest , to adhere to its teachings . " At the same time , the Rt . Rev. Randolph Claiborne , Jr. , Bishop of Atlanta , declared that the trustees ' actions " have forfeited the right of implied or official support for the Lovett School by the Episcopal Church . " But to many , the bishop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bringing pressure on the school . He presumably could ask St. Philip 's dean to resign as head of the trustees , or even forbid the holding of Episcopal services at Lovett . <P> He did none of these things , causing the Atlanta Constitution 's Publisher Ralph McGill , himself an Episcopalian , to resign from the cathedral , snorting " Utter hypocrisy " to an interviewer from the Atlanta church 's monthly newspaper The Diocese . McGill 's words never got into print , for a right-hand man of the bishop rushed to The Diocese 's print shop after the press run was over , gave orders that the entire issue be destroyed and a new one distributed without the interview .
