The sweetest Christmas music Berliners have heard in more than two years had nothing to do with Bach or Handel . It was the ugly stutter of jackhammers tearing gates in the Berlin Wall , the whine of cranes removing zigzag barriers from heavily guarded crossing points . Then , late last week , the candy-stripe customs poles went up , and thousands of grinning , gift-laden West Berliners swarmed through the Wall for their first reunions with eastern sector relatives since August 1961 . A long row of glowing charcoal braziers warmed the approach to the Oberbaum Bridge , and two brightly lit Christmas trees guarded its western end . On the other side of the River Spree , even the trigger-happy East German Vopos wore grins above their cradled submachine guns . <P> Only till Midnight . Ironically , Communism 's grudging Christmas present to West Berlin seems to have originated in the toy factory of Nikita Khrushchev , who resembles Santa Claus only in shape . Chilled by the reception East Germans gave him last summer at the Wall , and aware that the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in East-West relations , Khrushchev talked East German Boss Walter Ulbricht into opening negotiations for the Christmas visits . <P> Ulbricht was apparently in no mood to be generous . The hole in the Wall is a tiny one by any measurement . Only those West Berliners who have immediate relatives in the Communist part of the city may pass through the five special entry points designated by the East Germans . Passes , issued by East German postal officials , are good through Jan. 5 , but only from 7 a.m. to midnight , except on New Year 's Day when the pass holders may stagger back as late as 5 a.m . Though some 800,000 West Berliners qualify for the passes , many of them are Flchtlinge-refugees from East Germany who would be nabbed by the Vopos the moment they crossed the Wall and therefore will not dare to try it . <P> Tears &; Brandy . But despite restrictions and Red tape , some half a million West Berliners will probably make the sentimental journey before the holiday season ends-many of them more than once . Tears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandparents sized up snowsuited two-year-olds they had never seen except in photographs . " Does the baby meet the family standards ? " asked one proud West German mother . " Ja , schon , " wept the grandmother . Although the West Berliners arrived laden with everything from Lebkuchen to long underwear , not all the gifts came from their side of the Wall . One East German lad blew a year 's savings on two geese , a sweater and a bottle of brandy to welcome his long-immured relatives . <P> Some Western diplomats felt the Communist Christmas present was wrapped in blackmail , nervously awaited Ulbricht 's next move . But though the hole in the Wall will be sealed up after the holiday season , it will never seem so impenetrable again . After this brief , tantalizing breach , the Wall 's ugly masonry will look all the more intolerable-to East and West Berliner alike .
