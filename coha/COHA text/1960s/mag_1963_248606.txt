When Pierre-Paul Schweitzer was first mentioned as a successor to the late Per Jacobsson as the $40,000-a-year ( taxfree ) head of the International Monetary Fund , everyone seemed in favor of the idea-except Schweitzer himself . An unassuming and dedicated French senior civil servant , Schweitzer was reluctant to leave his post as No. 3 man ( with a chance for the top job eventually ) in the Bank of France , did not like the idea of moving his wife and son from Paris to Washington . Word went out that he had been Jacobsson 's own personal choice , and as the pressures mounted , Schweitzer finally gave in . Last week he was officially named the new watchdog of the world 's currencies . <P> <P> Elegant and lanky , Schweitzer , 51 , is not expected to make sudden or radical changes at the IMF . He is a pragmatist , and is wary of grandiose global formulas for solving the world 's fiscal troubles . " I 'm not an economist in my own right , " says Schweitzer . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMF should concentrate its attention on the underdeveloped nations , feels that there should be a gradual increase in the world 's money supply to finance increasing world trade . But he insists that any increase in funds should be initiated by national treasuries and not through any sort of IMF-sponsored arrangement . <P> A nephew of Philosopher Albert Schweitzer , Schweitzer was born in Alsace-Lorraine , is a member of the small French Protestant elite that has played a role in French banking out of proportion to its numbers . He joined the French treasury in 1936 after graduation from Paris ' Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques , went underground as a Resistance fighter after France 's fall in 1940 , and spent the war 's final months in Buchenwald . His education in international monetary affairs began in 1947 , when he became an alternate member of the IMF board . In a succession of important French administrative posts , he helped conceive and carry out the devaluation and stabilization of the franc , laying the basis for France 's remarkable economic renaissance .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
