txt A slide in the stock market and Presidential maneuvers to head off price increases may be disturbing some investors and businessmen , but not , from all indications . the urge of many Americans to buy new cars . Auto company officials here expect this to he their beet year since 1955 , when sales ballooned to a record 7 4 million . They estimate that Americans will take delivery on about 6 9 million new cars before the year is out , of which 6.550,000 will be built in the U.S. and 350.000 overseas That would be 177 , more than in 1961 and more than in 1960 , which had been the second best sales year up to now . To be sure , the decline in the stock market , if it continues , could weaken the confidence of consumers and cause them to draw back from major purchases . such as cars . But so far , auto sales specialists see no such sign . In the last 10 clays of May , dealers around the nation sold 254,000 new U.S.-built automobiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same period in which the stock market had its biggest single-day drop since 1929 . Early June Sales High Sales weakened a bit in thb first 10 days of June but still continued at the rate of 20,247 cars a day . which was up 21% from a year earlier and only 253 cars a day below the strong 1960 sales rate Auto men say there is every indication that they will have sold over 3 4 million cars by mid-year , which would be of their 1962 goal . Auto production next week could drop to its lowest levet of the year because of a strike that may halt Ford Motor Co. assembly operations For this story and a breakdown of auto sales by makes , see story on page 2.1 Auto economists ' predictions of continued strong sales are based on three factors . Their surveys show that consumer confidence is , for the most part , high . Credit funds are in plentiful supply and are being used more widely . The used car market is strong . An insight into auto buyer attitudes is provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing survey , conducted by an outside research organization . of " plans to buy . " He has found that the poll , which samples the buying attitudes of some 10,000 consumers each month , has provided a sound basis for forecasting actual sales . After President Kennedy 's bout with the steel companies in April . the pollsters did , in fact , notice an effect on buying confidence , but it was limited largely to consumers with managerial jobs , according to the economist . Significantly , however , the survey found that the confidence of blue collar workers had " risen rather sharply . " apparently because of a general feeling that living costs will be held in check by the rescinding of the steel price boost . Thus , the net prospect is for continued strong auto sales , even though there may have been a shift in the makeup of the prOspective buying group , according to the survey . Used Car Encouragement The auto men also have found strong used car sales and prices to be a source of encouragement . Used car prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry that there is a close correlation between them and new car sales . The reason is that when used car prices are high , the effect is to give most buyers a higher down payment on a new car , since most put up their old car as all or part of the down payment . Thus , more buyers can meet minimum down payment requirements of finance companies or find that they have to put up less cash to buy a new car than they expected . The latest average wholesale price on a two-year-old car , as computed by an auto company , is $1,202 , compared with $1,115 a year ago . The figure is the highest for this time of year since 1959 . Used car prices have climbed substantially , since last December when the wholesale price of a two-year-old car was $1,135 , a dip from $1,242 in October . The fact that this decline was reversed leads one auto economist to comment : " I was about ready to revise my estimate for 1962 downward on the basis of used car prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , in the auto industry 's view , is another reason for optimism . In 1961 , car buyers were repaying auto installment debt faster than they were taking new loans . Partly as a result of this and partly because of a general loosening in supplies of lending funds , finance companies have plenty of money to lend car buyers . Currently , the amount of funds loaned out is rising by about $100 million a month , after deducting loan repayments . This means , according to an auto company economist , " that while this may cause some problems in the future , right now it shows that consumers have a willingness to use credit , and ' Via a reason for optimism . " Outstanding auto installment credit , at $17.3 billion , is at a record . Ford.Sees Good ' 63 First Half Henry Ford II , chairman of Ford Motor Co. , said this week that " we feel we 'll have very good business thrcrugh the first half of 1963 . " But most auto company economists figure that the full year 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe that after the record year of 1955 , auto sales dropped 20% and after the good year of 1960 , they fell 10% . However , the auto men quickly add that a lot will depend on public reaction to the new models coming out this fall . Advance indications are that there will be no major engineering advances , such as new types of engines , in the 1963 models . But most of the auto makers are planning substantial changes in the styling of their cars . Auto officials generally think that styling has a potent effect on sales One theorizes that in 19.55 a year when all the auto COMpan.e , niaoe major styling chances the lure of new styling alone a , , ounted for about 5 ' , of the record volume Thus if new stcling of the 1963 MO. - lids should win ronStarrier , ' favor coluine next y ear , ouid be given a substantial lift . In making omparisons with record 1955 auto men keep in mind that their industry has changed significantly in the . even sears ; hat have intervened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lisely to be as large as in 1955 is more solidly based For one thing . some economists argue that the phenomenal sales of 1955 were partly a result of a sudden relaxation of credit by firms making auto loans . New car buyers were suddenly permitted to stretch their payments over 36 months instead of the 24 that had been standard before . This meant that some customers could buy new tars with lower monthly payments than were required if they bought a late model used car , even though they had to stretch payments over a longer period The 36-month loan is now common . and there has been no sharp easing of credit terms this year . Also , there is evidence that more new car buyers today look upon their purchase simply as a means of obtaining comfortable transportation . Many 1955 buyers may have been attracted by a status consideration . auto men theorize A heavy percentage of sales in 1955 were chrome-laden autos in what was then called the medium-priced class such as Buicks . Mercurys and DeSotos . This year , while some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , such as the Fal- con Chevy II and Valiant . are accounting for 34% of all domestic sales . If auto buyers are more conservative , there are indications that auto dealers are too There are many fewer of them today than in 1955 , but from all indications the ones that remain are less given to the wheeling and dealing practices of 1955 In that year there were 40 4 , i0 franchised new car dealers in the US. and they sold an average of 183 cars each This Year there are only 31.500 dealers but if domestic volume hits the expected 6.550.000 , they 11 sell an average of 207 cars each . Dealer profits in the first quarter this year . a , cording to the National Automobile Dealers Association were the best since the first quarter of 1955 Dealers now carry higher inventories of cars partly because of the greater number of models , and body styles On June 1 . dealer inventories of unsold new cars totaled 948,700 , or slightly less than a 38-day supply at the sales rate then In June 1955 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sales rate then Auto officials say there are about 400 different car models today compared with 325 seven years ago , despite the fact that some famous old nameplates , such as Packard , Willys and DeSoto , have departed from the passenger car scene . While the conti.bution of automobile production to national employment still is signitic ant , automation has reduced its impact . In 1955 an average of 730.000 production workers were employed to build the record-breaking numier of cars . This year . employment is about 550.000 As with dealers , those that remain seem to have greater security . High unemployment benefit costs have forced auto makers to keep their workers more steadily employed . , Straight-time hourly wages for production workers have climbed to $2.91 an hour from $2.29 in 1955.
