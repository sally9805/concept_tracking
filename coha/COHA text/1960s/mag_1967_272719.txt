Balancing the Budget <P> Sir : Your Essay " How To Cut the U.S. Budget " Dec. 8 , in the paragraph on Agriculture , raises some questions that cast doubt on the amount of research done by your writer . You claim the farm to be the home " of the nation 's most coddled minority " - coddled by whom ? Certainly not by the U.S. Department of Agriculture whose planning and continual changing of the Feed Grain Program has brought the price of corn down again this year . You blame rising food prices on Government subsidies-how about the fact that the U.S. housewife today wants her food completely prepared for her before she buys it , does not this add considerably to the cost of food in the supermarket ? Furthermore , as a nation , we still enjoy the lowest food costs ( in terms of annual income of consumers ) of any industrial nation . True , hunger stalks half the world , but the U.S. farmer will not gain much by giving food away-the good feeling one gets from acts of charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps what concerns me the most is that a city slum dweller with an income of less than $3,000 a year becomes a prime target for the War on Poverty ; but a farmer with a net income of less than $3,000 a year is part of a " coddled minority . " <P> JOHN D. UPFIELD Editor <P> The Villager Lake Village , Ind . <P> Sir : By supporting appropriations for the SST , TIME has demonstrated a research incompetence exceeded only by that of the Federal Aviation Administration . <P> You would be hard-pressed to find a competent acoustician , heart specialist or surgeon who would find the startle of the sonic boom acceptable to society . Air routes that avoid populated areas and economists who agree with the FAA are equally rare . <P> DR . ALAN RHODES <P> Willoughby , Ohio <P> Sir : Thank you for a bold and enlightening perspective on economics . Also , thanks for such a wisely proposed allocation of our American funds . <P> JOHN MAHANNA <P> Chicago <P> Three Cheers for Mac <P> Sir : Robert McNamara 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forgotten . One may not agree with all of his policies or actions , but in this complex world he had the courage to try . In this hour , which must be painful to him , the American people should give him a rousing cheer for a job well done . <P> JOHN J. GIBA <P> Rosemont , Pa . <P> Sir : In lamenting the departure of Mr. McNamara , my boss for the past two years , I should like to make a few observations on our era : glamour and personality , petty and inconsequential qualities seem to play much too great a role in the selection of our national leaders . Mr. McNamara , with his drab , oldfashioned , almost spartan public image , has proved a welcome and competent exception to the rule . His unquestioned integrity , coupled with his demonstrated ability , loyalty and courage , mark him as one of the truly unsung heroes of our time . It is regrettable that such enormous talents are to be relegated to the second-class showcase of the World Bank presidency . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division Viet Nam
