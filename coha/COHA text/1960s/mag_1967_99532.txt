Out of office at the time was Winston Churchill , powerless but still the beloved hero of the people . Well , Jack Nicklaus , who is the finest golf player in the world today when he is on his stick , has his Churchill : Arnold Palmer , still the people 's choice though he has not won a major championship for more than three years . // Never was this strange state of affairs more evident than at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield , N.J. , where Nicklaus was winning his second Open championship with a five-under-par 275 , the lowest score ever recorded in this 67-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he beat Palmer by four very convincing strokes and the rest of the field by the distance of one of his mile-long tee shots . But throughout the final two rounds of the championship , when the chance of the draw paired Nicklaus and Palmer , Jack 's finest shots were greeted by the gallery with what was almost a silent hostility . At times his worst mistakes were applauded , while Arnold 's lesser shots were cheered like the slashing strokes of victory . // The drama of Nicklaus 's memorable triumph was heavily accentuated by the accidental theatrics of the head-to-head pairing with Palmer during those two climactic rounds . It was a me-against-you confrontation that had been a long time coming  --  and the spectacle was worth the wait . // At first glance , Baltusrol docs not seem to be a course that would provide the stuff of history . It sits amid some lovely parkland in the rolling hills of central New Jersey , no more than half an hour by car from the bridges and tunnels that cross the Hudson River into Manhattan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairways are not necessarily ominous from a modern pro golfer 's point of view and only rarely come into play . The fairways for the Open were relatively wide and gorgeously groomed . The greens were generously expansive  --  not the parking-lot size of so many newer courses , but large . Nor did they appear viciously contoured , although like many older greens they have developed subtle borrows that are nearly invisible to the untrained eye but are just enough to turn a well-hit putt off line . Baltusrol 's 47-year-old Lower Course was in magnificent condition , perfectly fair and inviting as the 150 golfers arrived and got down to work without  --  for the first time in living memory  --  a cacophony of complaints about a U.S. Open layout . // From the beginning at Baltusrol , Nicklaus was in a winning frame of mind . For the first time since his pro career began five years ago , people were raising questions about his golfing ability . Certainly , he was having his worst season . He had won only one tournament , and his seemingly ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palmer scale . Since Palmer was at $91,213 Jack would rank himself at minus $59,892 . He had missed the cut at the Masters , and the right-to-left style of play that he had for some reason been turning to in the last few years had become completely uncontrollable . In April , faced with his Masters disaster , he decided it was time to revamp his game , and he did . // When he checked in at Baltusrol for his practice rounds he was hitting the ball left to right again , and as well as he ever had in his life . On Wednesday , in his last practice round , he shot a 62 , two strokes below the competitive course record . ( " That wo n't shake anybody up but Jack , " said Palmer. ) // Palmer , meanwhile , had brought his own game to one of its frequent peaks , and he , too , was as ready to win as he ever had been . True , he had his aches . It is startling to realize that a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 40 , a time when , as some sage put it , " life is just a matter of patch , patch , patch . " At 37 , Palmer has begun to feel a few of the twinges of departing youth  --  a muscle strain here , a touch of bursitis there . Last year it was a pain in his shoulder . At the recent Masters it was a dizzy spell and shortness of breath that bothered him at the 17th green of his third round and impelled him to give up cigarettes again . He came to Baltusrol with a muscle spasm in his hip that had been annoying him for a week . After a practice round on Monday he climbed into his Jet Commander and flew home to Latrobe , where the family doctor prescribed heat and Ben-Gay and rest . Back at the golf course , he further shortened his swing  --  already shortened a bit during the past year or so in the interests of accuracy . By Wednesday he was wondering if he could play at all and saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing or even warming up before tournament rounds in order to spare strain on the risky hip . His golf game was nonetheless in fine fettle  --  provided he could keep swinging . // As he started his opening round on Thursday , Palmer looked anything but his best . He drove into the rough on the first hole and hit into a greenside bunker on the second . By the time he reached the 13th green he had visited the rough and sand repeatedly , and he stood two over par . But a 45-foot sidehill putt that rolled into the hole at the 13th changed all that , and further birdies at 14 and 18 brought him into a seven-way tie for second , two strokes behind the only other figure to really impose himself upon this Nicklaus-Palmer Open , a 23-year-old ex- University of Houston star named Martin Alan Fleckman , who came in with a 67. // An unknown always seems to lead the Open after the first round , so Fleckman 's emergence created no wild surge of excitement . It was assumed he would shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 73 , and then came back with a very nervy 69 on Saturday  --  after going three over par on the first two holes  --  which gave him the tournament lead again . This time , instead of talking about shooting an 80 , the wise ones were talking about Johnny Goodman , the last amateur to win the U.S. Open some 34 years ago . So , on the last day , Fleckman did shoot his 80 , to finish tied for 18th , but a most stimulating 18th. // Friday dawned as oppressively hot and tormenting as New Jersey can get in June , and in the breathless hours around noon temperatures must have topped 100 ? on the baking putting surfaces . " Hot ? " said Ben Hogan . " Hell ca n't be any hotter . I 'll check that out one of these days . " Nicklaus , too , was hot . His opening-round 71 had occasioned speculation that he had left his best golf out on the course the day before during that fantastic 62 , but Nicklaus denied it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . // The Nicklaus theory was supported by Friday 's events . He started with a bogey , and at the 4th hole , a par-3 , he found himself with a 10-foot putt that he needed for his par . " If I miss it I 'm two over for the day and three over for the tournament , and it would be looking very bad for me , " he said afterward . But the strange-looking Bull 's Eye putter with the white-painted head that he had borrowed from a friend of Deane Beman 's a few days before got the ball into the hole . // Two birdies brought Nicklaus through the first nine at 33 and , with three birdies and a bogey on the way home , he was in with 67 , the lowest score he had ever shot in a U.S. Open . What seemed to please him even more than his new white putter was his driving . " All the Open has ever been is a driving contest , " he said , in what rated as the oversimplification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairway and play it from there . " // The day was almost over when Palmer brought in a 68 to take the tournament lead at 137 , thanks to a round in direct contrast to his rather shaky opening 69 . He hit the ball quite well all the way , except for a brief lapse on the 6th hole , where he had to sink a 10-foot putt to salvage a bogey 5 . That was the only green he failed to reach in the regulation number of strokes . His ball was in the rough only twice , and he was never in a bunker . Of both Nicklaus and Palmer the same could now be said : their shot-making was superb , and only the treacherous rolls in Baltusrol 's greens had kept them from rounds in the low 60s . It was time for the confrontation . // As they started down the first fairway Saturday afternoon , the tournament now at its midpoint , Nicklaus was a stroke back of Palmer . Bill Casper , the defending champion , was just one behind Nicklaus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 19,598 anticipated with such relish quickly deteriorated into something resembling the consolation round at a taxi drivers ' golf outing . Not since 1962 , in the Open at Oakmont , had Palmer and Nicklaus been paired in a major championship while having a chance to win . The opportunity to get at each other was more than their golf swings could bear . By the time they reached the 8th tee they had thrashed their way through so much trouble that they had surrendered the lead by two strokes to Casper , who was playing just ahead of them . At that point Jack turned to Arnold and said , " Let 's stop playing each other and play the golf course . " // On they went without conspicuous improvement , Casper 's lead increasing to four strokes . Finally , on the 16th green , each made a ridiculously poor short putt that would have given either of them his first birdie had it dropped . When Jack 's rolled two feet past the hole , Arnold turned his back and began to laugh . " Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was applying to his own putt as well . The gallery joined in the mirth , and from that moment on  --  the tempo of the bad play broken  --  the 1967 U.S. Open was a different story . // In the remaining 20 holes Palmer was to post only one bogey , a performance that could well have presented his Army with the victory it screamed for , but Nicklaus was to make a phenomenal 10 birdies . His streak began at the 17th , where he hit an eight-iron to within 12 feet of the hole . The gallery watched numbly , but when Palmer 's wedge landed only six feet away the crowd exploded with joy . Palmer walked onto the green to an enormous ovation ; silence greeted Nicklaus . Then a wonderful lone voice burst out : " That 's all right , Jack , I 'm for ya . " The vast gallery roared its amusement . Nicklaus tipped the peak of his visor in the direction of his fan , and sank his birdie putt . // The 18th hole was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par-5 . Palmer hit a four-wood from the fairway that carried just over the green , and the gallery applauded enthusiastically . Nicklaus followed with a four-iron up the hill , and the silence of the thousands of people surrounding the green implied that the ball must have bounded away , maybe into the pro shop or down the driveway . Instead , it was 15 feet from the hole . From there Nicklaus two-putted for his second straight birdie . Minutes later he was a lone figure out on the practice tee . He worked on his game until darkness fell . // Thanks to their Saturday dedication to bludgeoning each other , Nicklaus and Palmer started the final round in a three-way tie for second place with Casper , who had run into a bogey streak himself . A stroke ahead of these three was Fleckman , the amateur . Once again Nicklaus and Palmer were paired , a freakish circumstance that tournament officials would have liked to avoid , especially in view of the rabid nature of Arnie 's Army , New Jersey Division . But the USGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring . When players are tied , the man who turned in his score first is considered the leader in that category . Thus Fleckman , at 209 , was paired on Sunday with Casper , who was the first man to post a 210 on Saturday . That left Nicklaus and Palmer , the other 210s , with nobody to play with but each other . // This time , however , Palmer and Nicklaus were determined not to let their personal rivalry overcome their concentration on the championship at hand . Within minutes Fleckman and Casper were no longer in the Open . // At the end of two holes Palmer , playing steady par golf , had taken the lead as Nicklaus bunkered his approach on the 2nd hole and took a bogey 5 . Casper had already bogeyed the first hole , and Fleckman , obviously unnerved , could no longer hit the ball in a straight line . For a moment it looked as if the Army would have its way . // Nicklaus had other thoughts . He now began to hit some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended stretch of maximum-pressure golf . He birdied the 3rd hole from 12 feet , the 4th from four feet and the 5th from 13 feet . There was a slight interruption for a bogey at the 6th , and then he birdied the 7th from 22 feet and the 8th from 12 feet  --  five birdies in six holes that put him three under par and four strokes ahead of Palmer , who was unable to sink a decent putt and was being made to look like a duffer because he was merely getting par after par . // At the 10th , with his four-stroke lead looking larger and larger , Nicklaus unaccountably three-putted for his final bogey of the day . This misfortune actually produced a smattering of applause in the gallery , but Jack pressed on , striding Palmer fashion down the fairway , as his caddie and attending officials struggled to keep up . At the 13th he birdied again  --  from four feet  --  and at the 14th from five feet . Each time his hand went tentatively to the peak of his white visor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness of what it was seeing began to grip the crowd . Palmer obviously was not going to catch up , and the word was spreading : one more birdie and Nicklaus would break the Open record of 276 that Hogan had set at Riviera way back in 1948. // The record was on Nicklaus ' mind , but so was a parallel situation at last year 's Open in San Francisco . That was when Palmer had the same mark within his grasp and became so absorbed by it that he forgot to beat Casper . " Records just come , " Nicklaus later recalled reminding himself as he hammered out safe pars on the 15th , 16th and 17th holes . " Nobody should try to break a record . What you 're here for is to win a golf tournament . " // At the 17th Palmer sank his first birdie putt of the day , reducing the Nicklaus lead to four strokes . And that was how they stood on the tee of the 72nd and final hole of the tournament . Describing his thoughts afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make 6 or better . I felt like an idiot doing it , but I pulled out the one-iron and hit the ball down the right side away from all the trouble on the left . It landed in the rough next to some kind of obstruction . I do n't know exactly what it was a TV cable drum , and I got a free drop . To be safely short of the water , I used an eight-iron out and hit it fat . That left me about 230 uphill yards from the green . When I got out on the fairway I said to Arnold , That was a stupid thing to do , was n't it ? ' and Arnold kind of smiled and said , ' You said it . I didn't. ' // " So then I took out the one-iron again and hit it farther than I know how to hit it . Although I could n't see where it landed , I knew it was on the green , and I had the tournament won . " // With three putts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 22-footer , with all of his Germanic deliberation . At last he bent over , stroked it firmly and it rolled unhesitatingly into the middle of the cup for the birdie that broke Hogan 's record . // As the ball dropped , Nicklaus swung his right foot high in the air ( see cover ) , and the gallery gave forth its first true roar of appreciation for a magnificent golfing performance . Arnold , their leader , their favorite , had finished second , but on this day his defeat came at the hands of a man who was unbeatable . When Jack Nicklaus is at the top of his game , performing as he did on Sunday , he can not be beaten .
