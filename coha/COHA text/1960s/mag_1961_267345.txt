Taking a leaf from the book of his democratic rivals , Nikita Khrushchev went before Moscow 's TV cameras for a fireside chat of his own . In the bare , floodlighted studio , he seemed a little lost without an audience , speaking more slowly , peering at his manuscript , pausing often to gulp at the glass of mineral water at his side . On disarmament , on Laos , on Communism 's future , what Khrushchev said added little to the world 's knowledge of the Kremlin 's inner thinking . But on the subject of Berlin , his voice had a new take-it-or-leave-it brusqueness . " We can not delay a peace treaty with Germany any longer , " rumbled Khrushchev . " A peaceful settlement in Europe must be achieved this year ! " <P> Thus , as in November 1958 , the West by implication again faced a six-month " deadline " on the security of its travel and supply routes to its isolated West Berlin outpost ; for , as Nikita put it , " after the treaty , any countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach agreement with the government of the German Democratic Republic . " Ominously but somewhat ambiguously , he added : " If any country should violate the peace and cross the borders of others - by land , air or water-it will assume full responsibility for the consequences of aggression and will be dealt the necessary repulse . " <P> Down with RIAS . It had all been said before , but in East Berlin the little spade beard of East German Communist Boss Walter Ulbricht fairly bobbed with joy at Khrushchev 's words . Glittering , prosperous , capitalist-run West Berlin stands in humiliating contrast to Ulbricht 's own drab , run-down capital just across the sector border ; moreover , West Berlin 's refugee centers provide the escape route for most of the 200,000 skilled workers , engineers , farmers and white-collar professionals who flee Ulbricht 's miserable country for the West each year , sapping East Germany 's very lifeblood . <P> " All refugee camps must be closed , " snapped Ulbricht before a huge East Berlin press conference . RIAS , the U.S.-run radio station heard by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidated . " And Tempelhof , the big airport in the heart of West Berlin , would have to go out of business . " The present danger , noise and nuisance of low-flying planes over the central districts of Berlin must cease , " Ulbricht insisted indignantly . <P> Except for such minor restrictions , said Ulbricht , the Western allies could come and go as they pleased along the air corridors , railway lines , highways and canals that cut through 100 miles or more of East German territory on the way to West Berlin . But of course , he added , the West must in the future negotiate with East Germany for permission to use the routes . " We shall make our proposal , " said Ulbricht . " They will make theirs . " <P> Border Bonfires . Everyone understood Nikita 's problems . He had to keep Walter Ulbricht happy and hopeful , for beleaguered East Germany is still the machine shop of the Communist bloc , supplying tools , autos and heavy equipment to virtually all the satellite nations in the COMECON trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of some kind for October 's 22nd Party Congress in Moscow , when all his policies will come under scrutiny .
