Squeamish diners have long made spoon polishing a nervous ritual , and almost everywhere a dirty caf is called a " greasy spoon . " But an investigation of restaurant hygiene in Connecticut has shown that , of all dinnerware , the spoon is most to be trusted ; it is the bar glass that is furthest from grace . In swab tests conducted in nearly 1,000 restaurants , investigators found high bacteria counts on bar glasses " almost commonplace . " A count of 100 bacteria per utensil is thought to be a safe level ; bar glasses regularly approached counts of 3,000 . And spoons were almost uniformly clean . <P> " An average of 60% of the restaurants inspected were using unsatisfactory or no bactericidal treatment , " said a report on the tests last week . " Roughly 50% of their operators admitted they did not know they were supposed to be using any . " Restaurants in cities were worse than those in small towns , where a slower pace helps keep utensils clean : more time is spent washing dishes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardiest species of bacteria simply die on the shelf . <P> Other states are no better . Most state health codes closely follow the U.S. Public Health Service code , but health authorities , always short of inspectors , can not watch restaurant and caf proprietors closely enough . " All restaurant owners know what they 're supposed to do , " says the chief of Atlanta 's inspectors . " They just do n't do it . " <P> Ironically , keeping utensils clean is easy with modern germicidal treatments-chlorine , iodine or quaternary compounds . Even a 30-second bath in water heated to more than 170 is believed by many health departments to be sufficient sterilization for previously washed utensils . But in busy bars , where the bartender has little light to see by and little time to spend with the dishes , the casual , conversational " dip and swipe " method is the common way of washing glasses . <P> The best method of improving restaurant cleanliness , says the Public Health Service , is the complaint-loud , and preferably in front of other customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can presumably benefit from Connecticut 's experience by sipping whisky from a spoon .
