txt Paris Though the French in parlance tend to lump the Americans and British together as " Anglo-Saxons , " in practice they make a sharp distinction between them . The British , according to the French , can and no doubt will become part of Europe . as soon as they make a clear choice for Europe over the United States and the Commonwealth . This choice is for Britain to make : and it can not make it . the French believe , as long as it maintains special ties with the Americans . The United States , separated from Europe by 3,000 miles of ocean and an imbalance of power , can not become part of Europe . There will always be , in the French view , two elements to the Atlantic community  --  Europe and North America , politically independent of each other , yet strongly allied . The French find it natural that the United States , as the great power of the Western alliance , would like to maintain its hegemony of free world nuclear power , just as the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring atomic arms . A A A But the French hold it equally natural that the ancient nations of Europe should wish to play again a meaningful and independent role in the world . And this , according to President de Gaulle , can not be done until Europe possesses its own nuclear force , the indispensable key to policy independence in today 's world . The French arc suspicious of United States policy , but claim not to resent it . They simply blocked Britain 's entry into the Common Market to dry up a potential new channel of United States influence in Europe . The particular shape that European unity takes , the French say , should make little difTerence to the United States Government , so long as a strong and healthy Europe results . Thus the French would like the United States to play the " quiet American " and leave Europe alone to decide its own future . A A A The French regard some form of European unity as inevitable and they are working to impose the French version ? a system of confederated sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tensions icy . based on the model of the French - West German treaty signed in Paris last . month . Whether or not . French leaders will succeed in their design , they do not know . But they regard the results , however they may turn out , as threatening no vital American interests . Europe has progreskd to the point that it can ? and must  --  shuck off its unavoidable postwar dependence upon the United States . The French acknowledge that Europe has achieved this progress partly through American aid . But the independent Europe they envisage will always be allied with the United States , they insist . French officials claim President de Gaulle was the only chief of state within NATO who , during the Cuban crisis , flatly told President Kennedy his government would back the United States all the way to war . The French agree with the United States that it would be unfortunate for the West Germans to acquire nuclear arms , both for reasons of the past and because of Soviet react ion . But General de Gaulle also considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of manufacturing them , sooner or later will have its own nuclear arms , unless atomic disarmament intervenes . Thus France regards it as chimerical , for the United States to hope that West German participation in a multilateral NATO nuclear force will end the matter . The French prefer to " face the facts " : the Germans , they declare , regard the multilateral force as one step toward acquiring nuclear weapons of their own . * A This being so , the contruction of a French national nuclear force will not in itself , the French hold , hasten the march toward West Germany 's acquisition of these arms . French officials see the Soviet Union as continuing to strive , within the foreseeable future , for a bilateral settlement with the United States of Berlin , German unification , and other cold war issues . This could include a tacit agreement not to use nuclear arms against each other . This analysis of Soviet policy makes it all the more imperative , from the French point of view , for Europe to be able to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
