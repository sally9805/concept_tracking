Moslems and Hindus have lived side by side in bitter , sometimes bloody enmity ever since Turkish invaders brought Islam to the Indian subcontinent 900 years ago . Last week , in a dramatic repudiation of the ancient animosity , a Moslem was elected for the first time to the presidency of predominantly Hindu India . He is Zakir Husain , 70 , a former university chancellor who had been Vice President for five years under President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , who did not seek reelection . <P> The election of a Moslem to India 's highest , though largely ceremonial , post would have pleased Jawaharlal Nehru . As India 's first Prime Minister , he insisted that religion and politics should be separated in the newly independent country , hoped that India would develop into a secular , Western-style nation rather than a religion-centered Hindu homeland . Fittingly , it was his daughter who engineered the election . Selecting Husain as her candidate , Prime Minister Indira Gandhi argued that other countries would not believe India 's claim to ethnic and religious impartiality unless a Moslem could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his election . <P> It was quite a risk , especially in the wake of February 's nationwide elections , in which the Congress Party lost control of eight of India 's 17 state governments and dropped 82 seats in the lower house of Parliament . Hoping to deal Indira yet another blow , seven opposition parties , ranging from far-rightists to Peking-lining leftists , rallied behind a single candidate , former Supreme Court Chief Justice Subba Rao , a staunch Hindu . But the vote , conducted in the state assemblies and na tional Parliament , went to Husain by a solid margin . <P> Outnumbered 7 to 1 by Hindus , India 's 60 million Moslems live largely outside the country 's mainstream . They tend to mix little with Hindus , cluster in separate urban ghettos , have a different written language ( Urdu ) , and enjoy immunities from federal laws so that they , for example , may practice polygamy while other Indians must limit themselves to one wife at a time . Worst of all in Hindu eyes , Moslems are beef eaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Hindus consider sacred . President Husain , whose own wife still wears a veil and lives in seclusion as the Prophet recommended , hopes to relax the vexing tensions between the two religious groups . " We must talk less , quarrel less , work hard and ever harder , and hold together , " he said after his election . It was a sensible formula not only for India 's Hindu-Moslem troubles but for the country 's other problems as well .
