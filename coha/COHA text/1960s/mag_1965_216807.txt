Thus the nationwide coin shortage is actually a boon for the Administration , which has embarked on a crash program to double the Treasury output at the Department 's two mints ( Philadelphia and Denver ) . A far richer windfall for the Government , however , is the Coinage Act of 1965 , passed by Congress in July to cut the multimillion-ounce yearly drain from the U.S. 's dwindling silver supply. * The law stipulates that all new dimes and quarters must be silverless and the silver content of half dollars trimmed from 90% to 40% . <P> As a result , the Government , which sells coins to banks at their face value , will soon be minting unheard-of profits .

That said , the committee promised to report back on Dec. 1 with concrete recommendations on how to spend the windfall . <P> <P> *Stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository at West Point , N.Y. , it now totals 938.6 million ounces .
