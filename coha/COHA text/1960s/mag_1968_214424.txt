THE SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE : <P> WARREN G. HARDING IN HIS TIMES by Francis Russell . 691 pages . McGraw-Hill. $12.50 . <P> <P> Writing an exciting biography about Warren Gamaliel Harding is like filming a chase sequence with a wooden Indian . Harding 's instincts were all for posture . Like a suntanned Roman , he struck his Midwest Ciceronian pose and held it , occasionally delivering himself of the sort of speech that instantly self-destructs upon reaching the brain . <P> Francis Russell , historian of Sacco and Vanzetti ( Tragedy in Dedham ) , keeps his camera circling the 29th President of the United States and sometimes almost creates the illusion the body is twitching with life . Manfully he rates Harding as " an astute and able Ohio politician " and " above all , a kindly man . " But he is up against one of the great political still lifes of modern times . The personal portrait that emerges reveals a man notable mainly for his mediocrity of mind and spirit-a rather lazy fellow for whom somebody else always had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baseman . Even as a boy out of Blooming Grove , Ohio , " Winnie " Harding went in for nothing much more strenuous than tootling his B-flat cornet in the band . After five minutes of shucking corn , he gave it up for good , " saying it was too hard .

He also began to master perhaps his most highly developed skill : draw poker . <P> Backing into the newspaper business as a $100 investor in the nearly defunct Marion Star , Harding built it into a modest moneymaker , Russell claims , though apparently it was Harding 's wife Florence ( the " Duchess " ) who strong-armed both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman five years older than her " Wurr'n , " she was the one driving masculine principle in her husband 's life-the force that thrust him upward out of the comfortable country editor 's chair in which Harding liked to slump in a " digestive trance " after lunch . <P> Harding floated into the Ohio senate , then the U.S. Senate , borne on waves of alliteration : " Progress is not proclamation nor palaver , " he orated when delivering the nominating speech for Taft in 1912 . " It is not pretence nor play on prejudice . " He based his own progress on one cardinal rule : Do n't " offend anybody . " Half awesomely , he was described as " the greatest exponent of standpatism the state ever had . " <P> After the 1920 Republican Convention , which chose him over two abler candidates , Major General Leonard Wood and Illinois Governor Frank O.
