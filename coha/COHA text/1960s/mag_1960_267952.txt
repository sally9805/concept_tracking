" When I discovered folk music , I suddenly saw how dreadful the world could be , " says a singer from Los Angeles known to her friends as Odetta Felious Gordon but to her fans simply as Odetta . <P> Despite the blues , the anger and the protest that are part of her folk repertory , the world is not being dreadful to Odetta . ' This week she moves from Boston 's Storyville into Manhattan 's Blue Angel , applauded as the most exciting female folk singer in the U.S. <P> A large , dignified woman of 29 , she faces her audience with guitar lightly cradled in her arms , her moon face impassive , her eyes coolly remote . The number for which she is most famous is Water Boy , an old Negro work song , but she has in her repertory some 200 tunes , including This Land Is Your Land , Dark as a Dungeon , Great Historical Bum , Pay Day at Coal Creek . She is a keening Irishwoman in Foggy Dew , a chain-gang convict in Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low Country . Her dark , handsomely pliant voice has none of the whisky rawness long idolized in such untutored folk singers as Lead Belly or Bessie Smith . But what she may lack in sheer , gutsy exuberance , Odetta more than makes up with immense power , a fine range , and an amazing command of nuances and inflections . <P> Breaking Rocks . Her voice was originally trained for opera . Born in Alabama , Odetta grew up in Los Angeles , picked up money for her voice lessons working in a button factory and as a maid . By the time she entered junior college she was a chorister in productions of Verdi 's Requiem , Bach 's B-Minor Mass . In those days , she recalls , " if it was n't classical , I did n't want it . " But one night at a party she heard a group of performers from a San Francisco nightspot sing folk songs until dawn , and promptly " fell in love with the music . " She put together a sketchy repertory , sang at a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Thus began a career that took her to TV , the concert circuit , and last May to Carnegie Hall . She has half a dozen briskly selling albums on the market , will appear as the murderess Nancy in the forthcoming film version of Faulkner 's Sanctuary . What distinguished her from the start was the meticulous care with which she tried to re-create the feeling of her folk songs ; to understand the emotions of a convict in a convict ditty , she once tried breaking up rocks with a sledge hammer . <P> On Campus . Booked for concerts for a season in advance and for a midwinter European tour , Odetta now lives in Chicago , tries to keep nightclub dates to a minimum and sing as often as possible on college campuses , where she feels most at home . She learns most of her songs from records , and alters and polishes them to suit her needs . Although she once scorned the trappings of the folk singer , including the inevitable guitar , she has added a bass accompaniment to her performances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odetta .
