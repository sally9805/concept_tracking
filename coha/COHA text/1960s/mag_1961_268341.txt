In two hour-long talks with Hammarskjold , Bourguiba explained that he had to make good his promise or go under . <P> Washington , wanting nothing more than that the Bizerte issue be solved swiftly and equably , tried to mediate . France bluntly replied that the affair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Gaulle ominously broke his long and lofty silence : he sent a congratulatory message to the French troops in Bizerte.
