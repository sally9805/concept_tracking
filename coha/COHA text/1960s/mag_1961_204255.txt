By all the logic of integration , the South 's struggling Negro colleges should soon fade away , and Negroes ( still only 3% of U.S. college enrollment ) should flock to integrated campuses . Yet no such thing is happening ; the shift is socially and academically too formidable for most young Negroes . Southern Negro colleges still educate two-thirds of all Negro collegians , and Negro colleges will survive for years to come . And they have only one possible direction to go-up . <P> Last week in Miami the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools gave them a hard shove in that direction . The South 's accrediting agency had previously rated white colleges as " A " or out , and Negro colleges as " A , " " B " or " C " - allowing Negro colleges to be both approved and mediocre . Now , all Southern campuses will be on the same standard , giving 65 Negro colleges full and equal responsibility for excellence . Last week 33 won accreditation , 24 will get a second chance , and eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campuses in Alabama , a state that refuses to give such colleges more than pittance appropriations . <P> Prevailing Poverty . How good are even good Negro colleges ? Few can fault the quality of what are probably the top three schools . Washington , D.C. 's Howard is justifiably called " the world 's greatest Negro university " ( TIME , July 18 , 1960 ) . Nashville 's Fisk , the South 's first A-rated Negro campus ( in 1929 ) , has a Phi Beta Kappa chapter , a good library , an endowment of $7,000,000 . Atlanta 's Morehouse is a highly selective producer of Negro leaders ; its President Benjamin Mays is perhaps the best-known Negro educator in the U.S. Not far behind these three are Alabama 's Tuskegee , where Botanist George Washington Carver did his work , and Virginia 's Hampton Institute , the nation 's most richly endowed ( $19 million ) private Negro college . <P> Beyond these , quality gets spotty . Of the South 's 16 Negro land-grant colleges , not one has an accredited engineering school . No state-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one offers a Ph.D. , and that in education . It is a measure of the prevailing poverty that all 32 members of the United Negro College Fund , the top private campuses , have as their collective goal this year some $2,250,000-less than any single Ivy League campus rakes in every year . <P> Waiting for God . " The philanthropic dollar can go farther and get more in Negro education than anywhere else , " says one harried college president . The gauge of what money can do-and how much more is needed-lies in the record of Negro colleges striving for full accreditation . A study of one group of 48 showed that in a decade they boosted faculty Ph.D.s by 140% ( though only to a total 819 ) . Five years ago another group of 28 private colleges had a total endowment income of $2,620,000 , including one school with only $52 . Last year they hit $3,540,249 , and no school reported income less than $12,000 . The totals may be small , but the average percentage rise ( 35% ) is promising .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
