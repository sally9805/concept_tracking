High-risk insurance was pioneered in the U.S. by Philadelphia 's Insurance Co. of North America , which paid off every cent on a $300,000 " catastrophe " policy when the Boy Scouts ' 1935 Jamboree was called off because of a polio epidemic . The business of writing policies on highly unlikely contingencies , how ever , for years remained almost totally dominated by Lloyd 's of London . No longer . High-risk insurance is becoming an increasingly important part of the U.S. insurance business , and the dozen or so American firms that now specialize in it already account for fully a third of the $300 million in high-risk premiums written around the world each year . <P> The risks of being in high risk are sizable .

Under McKerrow , Continental has insured a railroad against any harm that might be caused by two Siberian tigers being shipped to a St. Paul zoo , also insured members of a private New Orleans club against excessive bodily harm caused by the Mardi Gras festivities . Luck and nerve as well as experience are important , but Continental generally shuns such risks as traveling carnivals , stunt pilots and amateur parachutists .
