The two men are of strong-and bitterly opposing-views . Missouri 's Senator Stuart Symington is a millionaire businessman ( Emerson Electric ) turned liberal Democratic politician . Ohio 's George Magoffin Humphrey is a millionaire businessman who served from 1953 to 1957 as Dwight Eisenhower 's rock-solid conservative Treasury Secretary . Last week Symington and Humphrey faced each other at a Senate Armed Services Subcommittee hearing-and the result was an explosion of wrath and recrimination . <P> Under Symington 's chairmanship , the subcommittee for months had been investigating the Government 's stockpiling program under the Eisenhower Administration . Symington has enthusiastically built up charges that Cleveland 's giant M. A. Hanna Co. made unconscionable profits out of a stockpiling deal . George Humphrey was Hanna 's board chairman before entering the Eisenhower Cabinet ; he held onto his thick portfolio of Hanna stock while in public office , and he returned to the company as honorary chairman upon leaving Washington . <P> Good Deal . The complex details of the disputed Hanna contracts seemed hardly the stuff for sensation . In 1952 , with the Korean war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel for war production , especially for jet aircraft . <P> At that time , the U.S. produced no nickel at all ; the entire supply was imported , largely from Canada . But Hanna owned an idle nickel mine in Oregon , and the Truman Administration began negotiating with the company to open the mine for production . On Jan. 16 , 1953 , just four days before the Eisenhower Administration took over , the Government and the Hanna Co. signed their contracts . <P> Those contracts undeniably added up to a good thing for Hanna . The Government agreed to buy Hanna 's nickel ore at $6 per ton ; it also agreed to advance the entire cost , some $22 million , of building a smelter to refine the ore . Although profit figures are in dispute , by George Humphrey 's own reckoning they came to at least $7,500,000-roughly double Hanna 's investment in the nickel operation . Moreover , under the terms of the contracts , Hanna last year took over ownership of the smelter for a mere $1,700,000 . But the deal worked out pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , when the contracts expire in 1965 , the U.S. will have accumulated an inventory of 94.7 million Ibs. of Hanna nickel at a total net cost of $67.2 million . <P> That works out to 71 per lb. , against a current market price of about 75
