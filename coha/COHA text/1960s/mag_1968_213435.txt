Although few of them are yet aware of it , Californians who own or rent property have something in common to grumble about . Until recently , state law provided that liability for injuries suffered by persons on their property varied according to the victim 's status . Most protected by the law were people like milkmen , repairmen and insurance agents , who were called to do business . Last in line to collect for injury were social guests and trespassers , both of whom had to take the premises as they found them , regardless of dangers . All the owner or tenant owed them , it went on , was to refrain " from wanton or willful injury . " Not any more , said the influential California Supreme Court last month . Reversing a lower court damage-suit decision , it found such categorization of victims obsolete . Henceforth , even a gate crasher who trips over a royal palm stump and fractures his drinking arm will be able to sue with equal protection .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
