All over Southeast Asia , an emblem with the gold initials SB on a dark-blue shield is as familiar as the U.S. dollar sign . It stands for the Shaw Brothers , sole owners of the largest show-business empire in Asia . Their chain of 120 moviehouses and ten amusement parks in a half-dozen countries draws tattooed headhunter warriors in Borneo , svelte Chinese beauties in Hong Kong , betel-chewing peasants in Cambodia , wisp-bearded mandarins in Viet Nam , combative Sikhs in Singapore . No one knows better than the SBs how to turn a profit from this varied audience . At a recent Singapore cocktail party , a rival movie magnate was asked who the two gentlemen in sharkskin were . Replied the rival : " Those are n't gentlemen in sharkskin they are sharks in Shawskin . " <P> Business &; Pleasure . The China-born Shaw Brothers have only one thing in common : a desire to make movies and money . Run Me Shaw , short and stubby , handles finances , avoids the limelight . Run Run Shaw , tall and thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He willfully holds conferences at 2 a.m. , buys and sells talent like cattle . He is the master of the Asian hard sell . When The Brothers Karamazov , starring bald Yul Brynner , played the Shaw circuit , Run Run organized a head-shaving contest with a prize for the shiniest pate , started a teen-age craze for bald heads . <P> Run Me collects race horses , names them after movie paraphernalia ( CinemaScope , Projector I , Vista Vision II ) . At his Singapore mansion , he keeps rare orchids and tropical fish , plus four man-killing Alsatian hounds to discourage thieves . Lacking some of his brother 's more exotic tastes , Run Run likes to mix business with pleasure , recently put up a twelve-story building in downtown Kowloon , with a nightclub on the first floor , offices on the third , living quarters for starlets on the eighth , and a luxury apartment for himself on the ninth . <P> Foreign Devils ' Lens . The sun rose on the Shaw Brothers in Shanghai in 1923 , when Run Run and Run Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parley with their two other brothers , Run Ji and Run Di . At issue : whether or not to sell their last remaining family possession , a dilapidated theater . They decided to sell their house instead and live in the theater , managed to put together a cumbersome stage melodrama called Man from Shensi , which inexplicably became a hit . One reason : the first night , the hero leaped into the air , fell through rotten floor boards . The audience laughed so hard that the brothers made the crash part of the play . <P> When American silent movies arrived in Shanghai , the brothers bought a movie camera-the " foreign devils ' magic lens " - and helped build up China 's huge movie market . Before long , civil war and revolution wrecked the box office . Whenever they opened a moviehouse in some warlord 's domain , recalls Run Run , " the warlord 's private army would invade the theater without paying , watch the film and rape the women customers . " <P> Stymied in China , the brothers moved into Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese . Run Me went by steerage to Singapore , carrying three of SB 's latest productions in a fiber suitcase . When he found that no theaters existed to buy his films , he scraped up enough capital to build his own .
