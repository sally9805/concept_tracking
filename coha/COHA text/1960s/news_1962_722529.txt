txt Pipeline promoters bent on grabbing a larger share of the nation 's bulk transport business are bringing howls of protest from railroads , water carriers and the unions that represent transport employes . The ' controversy , which is likely to grow warmer in the months ahead , centers around two giant pipeline projects which proponents claim will bring big transportation savings to the industries and areas they serve . One , called the Colonial pipeline , is being Wilt by nine major oil companies . It will originate in Houston , pick up gasoline , fuel oil and other oil products from Gulf Coast refineries and carry them northeast to Birmingham , Atlanta , Charlotte , Richmond , Philadelphia and some 25 other points all the way to New York ( see map on page 14 ) . With its branches It will spread over 2,600 miles , cost some $360 million and have the capacity of roughly 50 ocean-going tankers , or about 311% of the Gulf-Coast-to-New-York fleet . Rights-ofway have been purchased and the project is scheduled for completion by late 1963 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Transmission Corp. , would move coal , pulverized and mixed With water , from West Virginia mines to utilities in Philadelphia and New York . Stretching some 400 miles , it could handle 213% of present utility coal needs in those areas , now served by railroads . Two Railroads Foresee Doom Railroads , which already are In a. fierce struggle with inland barge lines for bulk business , are primarily concerned about the coal pipeline . The Central Railroad of New Jersey and Woatern Maryland Railway say It could put them out of business . The Transport Workers Union , which represents some 20,000 rail workers , contends it would cost 15,000 railway workers their jobs . - These forces are attacking proponents of the coal project where they are most vulnerable ? their need for the right of eminent domain so " as to be able to condemn land for a right of way . Opponents of the line blocked attempts by Consolidation and Texas Eastern to get such rights in Pennsylvania , Maryland and Delaware . So coal pipeline supporters have asked for an overriding Federal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent domain . The bill is backed by the Kennedy Administration , which railroads claim is still paying a political debt to West Virginia for Mr. Kennedy 's victory in the 1960 Presidential primary there . But Congressional observers figure that even if the bill passes the Senate , it will be held up in the House at least until next year because of the heat being applied to some Congressmen up for re-election this year . At the same time , the Colonial pipeline is coming under fire from the American Maritime Association , which represents 114 independent shipping companies . The association has asked the Department of Justice to take action against construction of the Colonial line on antitrust grounds . It charges that the owners could put tankers out of business and then jack up rates . Colonial spokesmen counter by saying that antitrust charges have no validity because the line will be a common carrier , open to any shipper . Pipelines More Competitive But aside from these controversies , many transportation authorities think the pipeline projects , which come during a period of bulk transport surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals demonstrate that pipelines are overcoming limitations on their ability to compete with other means of transporting liquids and solids . Pipelines ' share of Intercity freight traffic has stood at just over 17% In recent years . The Colonial pipeline , according to its backers , will be able to move a barrel of fuel to New York from Houston for about 35 cents . Not only Is that within the range charged by tankers , which traditionally have had lower rates than pipelines , but it Is the same as the 20-year-old Plantation pipeline charges between Baton Rouge , La. , and Greensboro , N.C. , which is only half the distance . In competing with tankers , the Colonial line will have an even greater advantage In serving the non-seaport towns along its route . It also will reach into areas now served by barge , rail and truck . One such town is Nashville , Tenn. , which now gets 1.5 million tons of oil products a year by barge . " This line is going to cause a lot of barge equipment to be tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that barge lines will have to cut rates 20% to compete . At Roanoke , Va .. now served by rail and truck , an oil company executive estimates the pipeline would cut his firm 's costs by 40 cents a barrel . Part of any such savings from the costs of a few years ago would result from pipeline automation , which further cuts the relatively few employes needed to run a pipeline . Colonial will have only about 200 employes , compared with 540 for the Plantation system . In addition , chemical inhibitors have been developed to curb corrosion , lengthening pipe . lines ' useful lives . Perhaps more Importantly , there is now a sufficient market in some areas to support the very large diameter pipelines that give the greatest capacity per dollar of initial cost . This is a highly important factor , because amortization of the initial cost is one of the big . costs to pipeline operators . The Colonial line will be 36 inches in diameter from Houston to Greensboro , N.C. : that 's a full foot larger than the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs from Philadelphia to Cleveland , has been the ranking oil products line . The Greensboro-New York segment of the Colonial is to be at least 30 inches in diameter . The owners of Colonial Pipeline Co. are American Oil Co. , a subsidiary of Standard Oil Co . ( Ind . ) ; Cities Service Co. ; Continental Oil Co. ; Gulf Oil Corp. ; Phillips Petroleum Co. ; Pure Oil Co. ; Sinclair Pipe Line Co. ; Socony Mobil Oil Co. and Texaco , Inc . Some oil industry sautlysts contend that an incentive for the Colonial has been increasing labor costs and union disputes on U.S.-flag tankers . The disputes have centered primarily around de-mends by maritime unions that more imported oil be shipped in tankers over which they have organizing jurisdiction . Much of this oil is now shipped on foreign-flag tankers . Last summer the dispute flared into an 18-day strike that idled 114 ships of the Gulf-East Coast run . The strike was ended by a Federal injunction but the Issues remain unsettled . Maritime unions see little chance of blocking the Colonial line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their efforts to persuade the Government to require that more imported oil be hauled by American-flag tankers . A spokesman for the National Mari , time Union says there are 30,000 seaman applicants for only 22,000 jobs and that the new ; . pipeline would eliminate 1,300 more jobs . In the case of the proposed coal pipeline , its backers claim that It would reduce by as much as $1.50 , or one-third , the present ** charge for hauling a ton of coal from West Virginia to New York . This estimate is backed up by results of a similar line built by Consolidation in 1957 to move coal the 108 miles from southern Ohio fields to a plant of Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co . The 12-inch line clogged up the day it was inaugurated , embarrassing its backers , but it has since operated 97% of the time , a company spokesman says . It has reduced shipping costs by 31 a ton , he adds . These savings are . significant when it Is considered that the price of the coal itself at the mine averages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line can be even more efficient than the Ohio line because It of improvements in utility powerplant equipment , the spokesman contends . The pipeline coal mixture is 40% water . In the Ohio opera ! tion , the mixture , or slurry , is taken out of the system and dried before being fed into utility burners . But powerplant builders now can avoid costly removal by feeding the slurry into centrifuges , which spin the water out , drying the coal further with hot air and then feeding it directly into the burner . The water that remains in slurry operations cuts fuel efficiency about 4% but this is more than offset by savings over other transport methods , a Consolidation official maintains . He also contends that utilities can save perhaps 3 million on the cost of each large new power plant If they use slurry because railroad ' and lump coal handling facilities wo n't be needed : " We visualize coal pipelining atroffering the development of a complete new industry , " says W. T. Thagard , vice president of Texas Eastern . " We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . " A Con-solidation official says his company is considering an Illinois line to feed Chicago utilities . It also is checking the feasibility of building a 600-mile line from Utah to California . Railroads already have blocked one coal pipeline by cutting rates . This happened in 1960 when Consolidation and some other firms proposed a coal line to serve Detroit Edison Co . The project was dropped when railroads reduced their coal rates to the utility , a Consolidation spokesman says . In a recent newsletter for commuters , the Jersey Central has noted that " more than 18% of our total freight revenue ( 37,500.000 a year ) is produced by bituminous coal traffic . Loss of this business would not merely create difficulties for us ; it would finish us . And , in the process , the railroad upon which you depend to get to New York and back would disappear . " But the Jersey Central claims that It could cut rates too If it were not hampered by Federal regulations from signing . long-term contracts on a regular delivery basis as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competing with pipelines and other bulk transporters by running special trains carrying a single commodity from a source to a large user . The Pennsylvania Railroad recently began offering such a service on coal at a 25% lower rate than under the normal system where coal cars are handled in regular trains carrying other freight . The single train system cuts switching and other costs . The Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad announced Monday that it plans a " major reduction " in trainload coal freight rates , partly because of the threatened competition from the proposed West Virginia-to-New York coal pipeline . The Eastern railroads are not the only ones having trouble with pipelines. , Texas &; Pacific Railway Co. claims it lost $1.5 million in bustnetts last year to Mid-America Pipeline Co. , which began pumping butane and propane gases , in liquid form , to points northward as far as Wisconsin from Texas and New Mexico in December 1980 . J. T. Suggs , Texas &; Pacific president , says the loss accounted for " almost 525b of our overall freight decrease for the year . " Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shipping liquid petroleum gas from Eunice . N.M. , to Kearney , Mo. , is 57.5 cents n hundred pounds . Mid-America Pipeline can carry 100 pounds for 37 cents . If the delivery point is " within 125 miles of a pipeline terminal , we 're out of the picture , " says a railroad official .
