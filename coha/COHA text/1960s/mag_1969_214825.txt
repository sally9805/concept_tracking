Manhattan 's renowned " 21 " restaurant swung open its iron-grille gate on West 52nd St. as a classy speakeasy during prohibition . It has since evolved into a unique American showplace : a restaurant run in some ways more like a club than a public accommodation . There is no longer a trapdoor on the bar to trip drinks into a sewer at the press of a button , but logs still crackle in the fireplaces and a $750,000 collection of paintings , drawings and bronzes adorns the paneled walls . Habitues include the rich , the powerful and the famous , plus thousands of others who flock there to see or be seen , attracted as much by the mystique as the cuisine . A hamburger lunch may cost $14 with a drink or two , yet industrialists , movie stars and social celebrities covet " territorial rights " to " 21 " ' s hard-to-get tables . Their patronage helps the club to earn a substantial profit on revenues of some $4,500,000 a year . <P> Last week , in a deal that combined friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the wide-ranging empire of Ralph E. Ablon , chairman of New York-based Ogden Corp . For about $10 million in stock , Ablon acquired the tangible assets of " 21 " ( among them $250,000 worth of old English silver that graces its walls ) as well as its valuable land and the three brownstones in which it operates . With the club came two offshoots : Iron Gate Products Co. , importers of caviar , grouse and other delicacies , and " 21 " Club Selected Items Ltd. , which imports cigars and smokers ' accessories . <P> Absolute Czars . The investment , as Ablon put it , was " ecologically perfect for Ogden " because the company already derives nearly half of its annual $1 billion sales from food growing and processing ( the other half comes from such varied interests as scrap metals , land development and shipbuilding ) . The merger also solved a problem for " 21 " ' s owners : the Kriendler brothers Bob and Pete , their cousin Jerry Berns and their nephew Sheldon Tannen . The family has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bob Kriendler had been wondering if the family should sell it lest the death of one owner create estate problems that might impair the business . The Kriendlers had had a number of offers for the club , but they wanted to stay in control no matter who owned it . " We have our own way of doing things , and it is an expensive way , " says Kriendler . " Who would let us continue to run ' 21 ' like absolute czars ? " <P> " I would , " replied Los Angeles Architect Charles Luckman , a friend of 30 years , when Kriendler mentioned his dilemma last August . Because of precisely the same situation , Luckman had recently brought his own firm , Charles Luckman Associates , into Ablon 's realm as a part of Ogden Development Corp . By coincidence , that deal had been struck over a two-hour lunch at " 21 " . Ablon , who is also a regular patron , quickly agreed that safeguarding such a symbol of opulence would be good business for Ogden.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
