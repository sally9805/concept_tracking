txt The role of a great power acting as international policeman is not an enviable one . " Go it alone " and the big country is accused at home and abroad of being arbitrary . Seek international support and it 's hard to get anything done . This is the dilemma that President Johnson faces between Vietnam and the Middle East . The President made an extraordinary effort to avoid acting on his own , when Egypt cast its sovereignty over the Strait of Tiran . The result has been delays , disputes , long negotiations , and a watering down of the final result . In a situation where " time is not on our side , " in the thrice-repeated phrase of British Prime Minister Harold Wilson during his Washington visit , these delays enable Egypt to gain much of its objective . The larger the list of maritime powers that will declare themselves for an " international waterway " and the " right of innocent passage " through the Gulf of Aqaba , the less is the chance of moderating the forward thrust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing or a bad thing for the international community is a matter for the wisdom of history . For the present , the United States stands embarrassed in its inherited role as the leading Western power , the only one now able to " keep order " in an era of revolutionary upheavals when there is not a true international police force . A month ago it was in trouble in Vietnam . Today , it is in more trouble , having sought to avoid the " mistakes " of Vietnam in dealing with the Middle East . It now is evident that there is no agreement among the maritime powers for a " hard policy " or a " firm policy " in dealing with President Nasser . The normal role of an international policeman , that of acting first and rallying support later , was passed up when Mr. Johnson turned first to the UN Security Council and then to intensive private diplomacy , anticipating the Council 's low level of success . The compromise wording of the maritime declaration that is indicated , as this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the psychological or military needs of Israel . It confirms what is generally conceded to be an Egyptian success and an Israeli defeat , in spite of language about an " international waterway " and the " right of innocent passage . " Most of the usual allies of the United States , beginning with Great Britain , pulled *World ' policing ' dilemma presents test for Johnson // back when the use of force was proposed to " test " the strait and if necessary compel Egypt to accept a return to the status quo . The result is language which is likely not to need a test , except for window-dressing and the saving of face . Whatever the rights and wrongs of this unusual situation , the United States finds itself negotiating a considerable success for its adversary , the Soviet Union and the Communist cause , in the Middle East . This is a far cry from the action of President Eisenhower , immediately landing troops in Lebanon when pro-Soviet forces seized control of neighboring Iraq . Compromise considered Prime Minister Wilson said the Communist countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forthcoming declaration . They are not now considered likely to do so . But the document is known to be not far from their wishes . There is a widely shared feeling in official circles here , though there is considerable strong opposition outside , that a compromise will not be bad for the interests of the United States in the Middle East in the long run . But there is uneasiness about following the slow " ineffective " multilateral approach , strongly favored by Mr. Wilson in his press conference here , in other cases . In Vietnam this would have long since meant Communist take-over , it is argued here , under conditions that would have threatened to overthrow the postwar stability between the Communist and non-Communist worlds . There is another faction here which says that the old-fashioned type of intervention or " show of force " is obsolete now . The United States will increasingly have to rely on political , economic , and social forces , it is said , until some form of effective international peace-keeping force is brought into being . This turbulence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American actions in Vietnam and the Middle East , and their respective results . It leaves a trail of unanswered questions after it .
