THE only safe haven during Europe 's dangerous Dark JL Ages and beyond was the castle , with its great moat , drawbridge and armed men glaring from the turrets . The era seethed with raids and counterraids , kidnapings and ransoms . No traveler was secure . Even Richard Coeur-de-Lion , King of England , so feared capture as he headed home from the Crusades in 1192 that he scuttled across central Europe in assorted disguises . No luck . Seized by Austria 's Duke Leopold , poor Richard spent a year in captivity before his weary subjects began to cough up 150,000 silver marks-twice the annual revenue of England . <P> <P> Power and Perfidy <P> Without stretching historical parallel too far , one can perceive in world events today certain startling resemblances to those times devoid of international order . A distinct strain of nasty , small-scale , almost personal violence among nations is emerging . The taking of hostages , for example , is becoming more and more popular : witness North Korea 's use and abuse of the captured Pueblo crewmen or China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also Ghana 's jailing of the crewmen of two Soviet trawlers on suspicion of espionage . More recently , armed <P> Communist Chinese junks pounced on six yachts off Macao and seized 15 persons , among them six Americans . <P> Terror is another weapon : Iraq 's brutal hanging of nine Jews as Israeli spies was clearly intended to intimidate the Israeli government , and the Arab commando attacks on El Al 's jets have precisely the same aim . Israel , a master of the extralegal reprisal ( the Beirut airport raid ) , has also excelled in long-range kidnaping , as in the classic case of Nazi War Criminal Adolf Eichmann , whom Israeli agents spirited out of Argentina in 1960 . Former Congolese Premier Moise Tshombe still sits in an Algerian jail , caught in a mid-air kidnaping in 1967 . Such is the climate of the times that fifteen planes have been hijacked to Cuba so far this year . On a larger scale , the latest Soviet-East German squeeze on West Berlin is a modern-day refinement of the ancient tactics of siege . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark Ages but of what Sir Harold Nicolson called the " wolflike habits " of the Italian Renaissance , when Niccolo Machiavelli lectured Medici princes on the judicious use of power and perfidy . In those days , diplomats were regarded as no better than spies . An envoy 's status abroad , in fact , was hardly assured until the Congress of Vienna established a European balance of power in 1815 . The relative stability that followed , as Henry Kissinger pointed out in his 1957 book , A World Restored , " resulted not from a quest for peace but from a generally accepted legitimacy ... an international agreement about the nature of workable arrangements and about the permissible aims and methods of foreign policy .
