The best way to teach the swelling ranks of beginning piano students in the U.S. is through class instruction . Yet music schools and colleges have for years avoided class piano lessons as much as possible . If each student in the room has a piano , the result is cacophony ; if there is only one piano , the pupils waste time waiting for their turn . Worse , they grow bored . <P> A solution to the dilemma has finally appeared . Several piano companies , notably Wurlitzer , Baldwin and the CBS subsidiary Fender Rhodes , have developed electronic piano laboratories in which as many as 24 students , each with a piano , can be taught at the same time by a single teacher . All the students use earphones . From a master control panel at his own electronic piano , the teacher can speak or play to all or one of the students , or can listen to one or all over his own earphones . What a youngster plays is usually heard only by himself except at those moments when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice . If the instructor wants to give the class practice in playing the same piece together , he simply throws a switch and away they go . <P> The obvious advantage of this method is that it makes easier the instruction of fundamentals-scale fingering , rhythm , sight reading . It also enables the students to spend most of their class time actually playing . The benefit for the teacher lies primarily in the fact that he is spared having to repeat lesson plans and general principles over and over to each student . <P> Those are the advantages that led Baltimore 's Peabody Conservatory of Music to run a six-month pilot study of the program earlier this year with the Baldwin version of the electronic piano . Says Dr. Dean Boal , dean of the school : " We had a kind of 1984 apprehension about the system when it first arrived . But not any more . Though it gives a good approximation of real piano sound , though its touch is reasonably realistic , obviously it will never replace the conventional piano . You can succeed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things it can not . When the student and teacher come to style , interpretation , nuance , touch , then clearly they will have to work at a real piano . " As far as Boal and most music teachers are concerned , however , the concept is sound for the teaching of certain basic skills . By that measure , the electronic piano is an unquestioned success .
