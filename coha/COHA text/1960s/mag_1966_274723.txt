Like many another woman before her , Jacqueline Kennedy last week got her way by stubbornly insisting on her rights . In her reluctant but aggressive battle to prevent publication of numerous personally embarrassing passages in Manchester 's The Death of a President , she scored a victory over Look magazine , which plans to begin serializing the book in its issue out Jan. 10 , and appeared likely to win a similar capitulation from the book 's publisher , Harper &; Row . <P> By threatening a costly lawsuit over the " painful " passages , Jackie forced Look either to delete or drastically tone down every last one of them . The magazine went out of its way to emphasize that the changes involved only 1,600 words out of 60,000 , and Editor in Chief William Attwood of Cowles Communications , the magazine 's publisher , told New York Post Columnist Murray Kempton : " We gave up some slush ; a little gingerbread 's off the top , but the structure 's intact . " The fact remained , however , that Look 's editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , Jackie took it away from them . After the Look negotiations , a spokesman for Harper said that the company " will be very glad " to settle Mrs. Kennedy 's suit along the lines of her agreement with Look . <P> Such lofty phrases as " historical accuracy " and " the right to know " were tossed about freely during the dispute , but they were not really at issue . Neither was " the book 's right to live , " as Harper Executive Committee Chairman Cass Canfield put it . The central point of the dispute was whether the author had violated an agreement guaranteeing the Kennedys ' control over Manchester 's final account of the assassination of John F. Kennedy . Whether or not the Kennedys should have demanded such an agreement was also beside the point . " Manchester made a promise , " said Jackie 's attorney , former Federal Judge Simon Rifkind , " and now has not lived up to his part of the bargain . " <P> Deadly Dozen . The settlement followed a week of politely barbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , Senator Edward Kennedy chided Manchester for refusing to cut out the offending passages " despite the pain he knows it will give Mrs. Kennedy . " In Manhattan , Canfield said that the row " has been the most trying and distressing one in a 40-year publishing career , " added that if either Jackie or Senator Robert F. Kennedy had read the book , " the present situation might have been avoided . " In Sun Valley , Idaho , a vacationing Bobby Kennedy paused on the ski slopes long enough to blast the publishers . " We did n't want to go through with a suit , " he said , " and we spent a lot of time trying to avoid that . But they drove us to that point . " <P> While the words flew cross-country , representatives of the Kennedys and Look were at work in Manhattan searching for a way out . At a weekend meeting in Manhattan , Jackie read key sections of the serialization . With former Presidential Speechwriter Richard Goodwin at her side , she pointed out twelve passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded their deletion . The passages included :
