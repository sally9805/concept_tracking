Joseph F. X. Muldoon is a retired plumbing contractor , an unforgiving man , a connoisseur of Irish whiskey , and ( he says ) a freethinker . When he called me a few nights ago to help him appraise a new bottle , just imported from some unheard-of distillery in Limerick , I suspected that he was having another Free Thought . Old Joe 's notions flow best in the presence of both a shot glass and an audience ; and when he ca n't find a more sympathetic listener , he sometimes drafts me . Before the bottle was a third empty , I had to tell Joe , with the candor of an old friend , that this time his ideas were not only ridiculous but dangerous . Did he want to get his teeth kicked in 7 They are false teeth anyway , " he said , " and at my age I am willing to risk martyrdom for the good of mankind , and to get even with my old enemies in the plumbers ' union . If somebody does n't stop those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painters ' , bricklayers ' , and electrical workers ' trades ? I 'm telling you that New York is doomed . " Why are the slums spreading like mildew in a damp basement ? Because nobody , not even City Hall , can afford to fix up the old tenements , much less build the fifty thousand new houses we need every year . " Why are building costs so outraHarper 's Magazine , January 1967 geous ? Because the construction trades are holding a cutlass at the public 's throat , that 's why . Not that I 'm against honest unions ? I used to be a union man myself ? but these crafts , in this city , have turned their unions into something very like a conspiracy against society . " For example , as of this night all of the plumbers in Manhattan have been on strike for nearly four months . Not over any real grievance , mind you , but because a power struggle is going on inside Local No. 2 between a couple of union bosses , Jack Cohen and Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lead pipe that they will stay out until after the next union election . " And why Should n't they ? The union members are n't suffering . They are all working , every man jack of them , in New Jersey and Westchester and Long Island . Plumbers are so scarce , you see , that they can take their pick of jobs outside of New York , even while they are keeping the city 's construction industry closed down tighter than a soldered joint . " Who does suffer ? Thousands of sick people , because the city ca n't open up five new hospitals which are practically finished except for the plumbing . Kids in four school districts where new buildings could n't be completed in time for the September term . All those families who could n't get into their new apartments last October first ? New York 's traditional moving day ? on account of no running water . A lot of them already had given up their old leases , and where are they now ? Going bankrupt in some hotel , or doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be many a broken home before this strike is over , " While Joe was refilling his glass , I hinted delicately that maybe he could be a little biased , as a hangover from his old wars with the plumbers ' union . After all , did n't a poor pipe bender have a right to try for more money and better working conditions , just like anybody else ? For an elderly gentleman with high blood pressure and a short-fused temper , that kind of question was definitely unhealthy . He choked and shook his wattles for a good three minutes before he got his voice back . " What do you mean , more money ! They already get an arm and a leg every time they fit a faucet . For a six-hour day their pay comes to $7.29 an hour , including fringe benefits , Mr. Fischer has been Editor in Chief of " Harper 's " since 1953 . Many of his Easy Chair essays and other articles have been published in book form in " The Stupidity Problem and Other Harassments. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumber who does n't make at least $300 a week . And his working conditions , if you can call it work , would make a nurse or schoolteacher shriek with envy . There he sits , with a helper to wipe his brow and light his pipe and pick up his tools , while he moves like the tide in Bantry Bay , barely fast enough to be discerned by the human eye . " * If the construction industry offers so good a deal . I asked , how come it is so short of labor ? Why do n't a couple of million unemployed people swarm into those sweet $300-a-week jobs ? " Because the unions wo n't let them , you idiot , " Joe said . " If you are n't a union member you ca n't work ? and most locals accept only a few new apprentices each year . And those few , as it happens , are nearly always the sons or nephews of old members . An unemployed Negro has as much chance of joining one of their locals *Other building tradesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get roughly comparable pay . Carpenters , for instance , have a contract calling for $6.93 per hour , including fringe benefits . Electrical workers get $7.70 per hour- ? and in their case the fringes include a provision that the employer pays the employee 's share of social-security taxes , to boot . For bricklayers , the base wage plus fringe benefits comes to $7.74 an hour ? about three times the general industrial wage . As the New York Times has pointed out , the building-trades unions never " pay any attention to the guidelines or to any other anti-inflation program . Their motto always has been to grab everything they could get . . . " THE EDITOR 'S EASY CHAIR as the New York Yacht Club . Did n't you know that the building-trades unions are about the most exclusive and segregated institutions you can find , short of the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society ? " They do n't see it that way , of course . They feel they have a God-given right to monopolize these particular jobs , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to his desk and began to fumble through a drawer full of old letters , family photographs , and newspaper clippings . Finally he found the clipping he wanted . " Here , " he said , " is a letter printed in the New York Times of August 3 , 1963 . I regard it as a very fair statement of the building mechanic 's creed . " It read : Some men leave their sons money , some large investments , some business connections , and some a profession . I have none of these to bequeath to my sons . I have only one worthwhile thing to give : my trade . I hope to follow a centuries-old tradition and sponsor my sons for an apprenticeship . For this simple father 's wish it is said that T discriminate against Negroes . Do n't all of us discriminate ? Which of us when it comes to a choice will not choose a son over all others ? I believe that an apprenticeship in my union is no more a public trust , to be shared by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should the government , be it local , state , or federal , have any more right to decide how I dispose of my heritage than it does how the corner grocer disposes of his ? ( Signed ) Charles Kelly Wantagh , Long Island " It is true , " Joe said , " that in the last few years the old monopoly has loosened up a little . In the old days , if a contractor tried to hire a Negro or Puerto Rican , his whole crew would walk oil the job in a flash . Now a few of the locals ? under pressure from the government and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ? are grudgingly accepting an occasional Negro apprentice . But there is still no sign that they will ever be willing to throw the job market wide open . " My plan would do exactly that . " We 'll start with the prisons , " he said . " Probably a majority of the poor devils inside them are there simply because they could n't earn an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a disproportionate share of the prison population , and no wonder . When a youngster grows up in a slum , with a third-rate education , a broken home , or maybe a father out of work , and with no chance to get an apprentice 's training , how can he learn to hold down a skilled job ? I do n't blame him ? much ? if he takes to mugging or dope peddling , out of desperation or sheer boredom . " In theory , at least , most penitentiaries try to teach their inmates some useful skills . Traditionally , convicts have been put to work making something that the state needs ? license plates , for example , or prison uniforms . But since these crafts are n't much use to a man once he has been turned loose , naturally he is likely to drift back into crime . " Recently , however , some prison industries have begun to branch out into more practical lines of training . In Texas , convicts can learn to be dental technicians by making false teeth for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's automobiles , roast and blend coffee , and make soap for the state institutions . As a result , Texas is saving about $2 million a year , and at the same time giving at least some of its criminals a chance to earn an honest living in the future . California goes even further . Its convicts make furniture and stationery for state offices , and toys for children in orphanages . Iowa gets most of its official typewriters repaired by prison labor . And a couple of federal penitentiaries are training their inmates to become computer key-punch operators . All of which is a good thing ? but it does n't go far enough . " What I propose is that we teach convicts all the construction trades , and put them to work on public building projects . The plan might work something like this : " As soon as a prisoner arrives at , say , Sing Sing , he would get a thorough screening by the resident psychiatrists . If he seems to be a really hard ease ? an irredeemable criminal type ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if he looks like a reasonably hopeful candidate for rehabilitation , he would be offered basic training in the building trade of his choice . The course would last just as long as he needs to acquire the fundamental skills . A fast learner might pick up the essentials of carpentry in four months . A slower man who enrolls in an electrical-installation course might need a couple of years . " His training would be quite different from that which an apprentice ordinarily gets on the outside . As part of their featherbedding policy , the unions have of course stubbornly opposed the introduction of modern methods ? whether paint-spray guns , power saws , or prefabricated components . The resulting inefficiency has forced up construction costs even more than the outrageous wage scales . In contrast , our Prisoners ' Rehabilitation Program would use only the latest tools , the most efficient methods . Consequently , our graduates would have a considerable advantage when they start looking for a job on the outside ? enough , maybe , to offset the prejudice of some employers against hiring convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass a qualifying test , he could become a special kind of trusty . He would be assigned to a team of construction workers which would leave Sing Sing , under minimal guard , to work an eight-hour shift on a slum-clearance or urban-renewal project . If he behaves himself , working conscientiously and not trying to escape , he can look forward to an early parole . Otherwise , back he goes to the lockup . Moreover , while working he would get the statutory minimum wage of $1.50 an hour , to he paid into a savings account so that he would have a modest nest egg when he is finally released . Under those terms , I do n't think many would try to run away . " " Your scheme will never work , " I said . " For one thing , the Teamsters Union would refuse to deliver building materials to any project employing prison labor .. . " " In that case , " he interrupted , " we would deliver it by state truck , protected by an armed guard . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , as it may any day now , he might take a more kindly attitude toward his fellow inmates . " " Even so , " I said , " the notion is politically impossible . Because no governor or state legislator is going to risk a fight with the building-trades unions . " " Are you sure ? " Joe said . " Take a careful look at all the good things the Muldoon Plan would accomplish ? every one of them packed with political vitamins . First of all , we could build a lot of public housing at a fraction of the present cost . The slum dwellers and the taxpayers wo n't forget that at election time . Then we would be training tens of thousands of Negroes to fill decent and much-needed jobs . That ought to fetch the support of the civil-rights organizations . " Best of all , the Plan would break the monopoly of the building-trades unions , and most of their political power along with it . As soon as a few thousand skilled , but nonunion , building mechanics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will no longer have to knuckle under to every piratical demand the unions make . What if the unions do strike ? The contractor can go right ahead with the job , using our Sing Sing graduates ? and he can get rid of all those ridiculous featherbedding work rules at the same time . " But if the unions are half-smart , outright strikebreaking will seldom be necessary . They would n't want to see the labor market flooded with a lot of qualified but nonunion workers . Therefore the Muldoon Plan will , I hope , force them to abandon their closed-shop policy , and replace it with the union shop , already common in a good many other industries . That is , an employer could hire anybody he likes ? with the understanding that the new man will join the union as soon as he goes on the payroll . That would put a stop to the unions ' segregationist and monopolistic practices , and end the artificial shortage of labor in the building trades . But it would still preserve all the legitimate functions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " the old political maxim that it is suicide to tangle with a union simply does n't hold true any longer . Not when the union is unpopular with the public .
