RULES &; ITS RULERS <P> IN the gaudy legends of the House Rules Committee , Kansas Republican Philip Campbell occupies a niche as the crustiest of that committee 's traditionally crusty chairmen . In the early 1920s Campbell sported a Napoleonic curl in the middle of his forehead and had a personality to match , using the obstructive powers of the Rules Committee to block any legislation that he took a dislike to . When he saw fit , Campbell defied a majority of his own committee . If other committee members passed a resolution okaying a bill for floor action against his wishes , he would exercise a personal " pocket veto " by putting the bill in his pocket and refusing to call up the resolution on the House floor . <P> Formidable obstructive powers still repose in the House Rules Committee-and in its chairman , if he has enough committee votes behind him . Over the years the committee 's frequent roadblocks have exasperated and angered Presidents and Congressmen bent on getting programs enacted , but its powers have survived undipped because Rules performs an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules Committee serves as the House 's traffic-control device , as necessary as traffic lights at big-city intersections . The House has 437 members , who among them introduce several thousand bills every year . Under an old House rule , every member has a theoretical right to speak for one hour on every bill that comes to the floor . Without firm traffic control , the legislative process would swiftly collapse into chaos . To exercise that control , the Rules Committee is equipped with powers to 1 ) decide whether a bill gets to the floor at all , 2 ) fix a maximum number of hours for debate on any particular bill , 3 ) set " gag rules " to restrict amendments to pending legislation . <P> In keeping with its great powers , Rules has privileges not accorded to any other House committee : it can , at any time , bring any bill it chooses before the House , and it can meet " without special leave " while the House is in session .

The House of Representatives had a manageable number of members ( 65 in the first Congress , in 1789 ) and a limited range of business , so traffic control was not a compelling need . But as the membership of the House and the role of the Federal Government expanded , the Rules Committee grew in importance and power . From 1858 , the Speaker of the House was a member of the committee , and ambitious Speakers made it an instrument of their own power . Maine 's Thomas Reed , Speaker in 1889-91 and again in 1895-99 , used to decide the business of the five-member Rules Committee with his two fellow Republicans without even bothering to meet with the two Democratic members .
