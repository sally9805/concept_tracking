Federico Fellini 's La Dolce Vita opened with a statue of Christ soaring through the skies above Rome . That was three years ago , followed by a long quiet period during which the masses have patiently waited for the master 's next full-length film . Just released in Italy , Fellini 's new " 8 " begins with . . . what have we here ? Soaring in the skies above Rome is not Christ but Marcello Mastroianni , all 154 pounds of him up there flying on a string like a great dihedral kite . <P> A man on the lower end of the string reels Mastroianni back to earth , grabs him by the leg and shouts , " I got him ! I got him ! " Perhaps so . But nobody gets the point . For two hours , the picture 's first audience sat in polite , astounded silence while Marcello wandered about the screen in a subjective story that was , at best , out of reach . <P> Happy Ring . Mastroianni plays a middle-aged movie director planning a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To get away from it all , he holes up at an expensive but sleazy thermal resort , where he relives his life in memory and in dreams full of Freudian images . <P> He sees in a pretty nurse ( Claudia Cardinale ) the symbol of purity and later recalls his childhood in a Catholic school , where he was seduced by a middle-aged crone . Mastroianni in Oedipal embrace with his mother is followed by Mastroianni in a harem being lovingly bathed in a vat by all the women in his life . Finally , Mastroianni has a vision that the film he wants to do is about the people he knows , not his fantasies . He dances in a happy ring with his actors and actresses . <P> Real Chaos . At the premire , there was scattered applause but no shouting for the director . As the film spread out in new openings , reactions were marvelously at odds .

" I 've never seen Last Year at Marienbad , I do n't know anything about Proust , and I have only seen one film by Bergman . " His director-hero , he explains , is just a man who finally accepts his own confusion and doubts and sees " that this chaos is the real force out of which his creativity comes . " <P> To help himself create this chaos . Fellini assembled an impressive cast that included some of his most devoted disciples-Mastroianni , Cardinale , Anouk Aimee , Sandra Milo . Even when shooting began , none of the actors knew what the film was about . There was no script , and the seven existing copies of an " outline " were locked in a safe each night . Only the egomathematical title itself has a concise and plausible explication : it represents the number of films Fellini has made until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was The Temptation of Doctor Antonio from Boccaccio ' 70 . <P> Fellini was annoyed at suggestions that the film was autobiographical . He and his hero Guido were , admittedly , both 43 and both directors . " But Guido. " he said , " is a failure as a director . "
