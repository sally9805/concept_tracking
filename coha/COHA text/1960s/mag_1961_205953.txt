" Your article on Marilyn Monroe , " read the letter to Columnist Al Ricketts of the Pacific Stars and Stripes in Tokyo , " was just plain lousy , unfair , unjust , un-100% red-blooded American , and nuts to you . " The reader 's gorge had risen over an unchivalrous evaluation of the film actress in Ricketts ' column " On the Town " : " There are gals in Hollywood who have more sex appeal in their eyelashes than Marilyn can cram into a gownless evening strap . They can also deliver dialogue without sounding like their mouths are full of Purina . " <P> The gorge of Al Ricketts ' readers is forever rising . Of the Pacific Stars and Stripes columnists , who include Walter Lippmann , Joseph Alsop , Red Smith and Lovelornist Abigail Van Buren , the most widely read by far is Ricketts , a Buddha-shaped ( 5 ft. 4 in. , 175 Ibs. ) 32-year-old who chomps a long black cigar with a ferocity suggestive of filmdom 's bad guy , Edward G. Robinson ( see cut ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lynching . As entertainment editor of the Pacific Stars and Stripes , the U.S. armed forces newspaper in the Far East with a circulation of 65,000 and an estimated readership of 200,000 , Ricketts reviews some 250 movies a year . <P> Pin Sticker . The chore brings out the worst in him . He has called Alan Ladd " the mightiest midget of them all , " John Payne " a grimacing sweat bead , " and Comic Mort Sahl " the thinking man 's Roscoe Ates . " He summarized Ocean 's 11 , starring Frank Sinatra , as an " Our Gang comedy for grownups . " The Fugitive Kind , a movie based on a Tennessee Williams play , was ' ' Tennessee Williams tromping around barefooted again in that same old Dixie cup . " Dazed by an endless procession of indefatigable ants in Walt Disney 's Secrets of Life , Ricketts wrote : " They know nothing but work , work , work and sex , sex , sex . Where they find the time to spoil picnics , we 'll never know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ricketts hostility wanes : " We-we liked-liked Can-Can . " <P> Such observations , appearing daily , have established Ricketts as the leader of a Far East cult whose followers exist mainly to revile him . " Your tastes coincide with a slob , " raged one such . " I stick pins in your column only in the hope that you will not sleep at night . " An American film exhibitor in Tokyo , infuriated by Ricketts ' reviews , made him a standing offer of free air passage home ; when Ricketts allowed that he found Elvis Presley 's " hiccuping " intolerable , students at Yokohama High School wrathfully formed a Send Al Ricketts to Mars Club . Recently , the irate husband of a belly dancer whose abdomen Ricketts had impugned challenged the columnist to a duel ; Ricketts escaped the field of honor by inviting his prospective adversary to even the score by insulting Mrs. Ricketts . <P> Passing Mood . Albert Davis Ricketts Jr . ( " Whoever heard of a columnist named Albert Davis Ricketts Jr. ? " ) was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played straight man-to enlist in the Army in 1952 . Sent to the Orient , he drifted onto the Pacific Stars and Stripes as a second-string movie reviewer , a job he regarded as license to torpedo everything he saw .
