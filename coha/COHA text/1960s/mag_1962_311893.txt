BURN , KILLER , BURN ! ( 391 pp. ) - Paul Crump - Johnson ( $4.95 ) . <P> Convict Paul Crump has been much publicized . The crime he was convicted for- a 1953 holdup slaying-was apparently the act of an angry young Negro who went wrong in an environment where nobody ever found it easy to go right . Last summer , when he was only hours away from the electric chair , Illinois Governor Otto Kerner finally yielded to mounting national pressure and commuted Crump 's sentence to life imprisonment ( TIME , Aug. 10 ) . Why ? Because Crump , in the course of his imprisonment , had become an entirely different personality . And one of the many things that helped to transform him was working on a novel . <P> Now out , the book is in some respects a pleasant surprise . <P> Looking back on his own pre-prison life not so much in anger as in new-found wisdom , Crump tells the story of Guy Morgan . Like Crump , Morgan hates his father , a hellfire-and-brimstone revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family for the favors of a particular girl named Zola . Morgan , like Crump , is brutally and unjustifiably beaten by a Negro-hating Chicago cop . But with plenty of precedent and plenty of excuse for blaming all Morgan 's troubles on society , Crump instead makes his story illustrate a more mature individual judgment-a man can live only if he forgets his own resentment and takes responsibility for his own actions . As presented by Crump , Morgan is not so much a victimized black as a man so full of hate that he ca n't see straight . Morgan confuses his father with the angry Jehovah his father so often quotes . When he steals for the first time , he hears the voice of Jehovah calling " Thou shalt not steal . " " Shut up , you son-of-a-bitch , " Morgan snaps as if in reply . " You should n't have gone away with Zola . " But most of Crump 's dramatic confrontations , like revival-meeting confessions , have an overwritten melodramatic ring . <P> Crump is aware of his novel 's short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " how can you keep from sounding vulgar ? " Despite this , Crump is writing another book , about a Negro prizefighter . Not much in Burn , Killer , Burn ! suggests that it will be even a fair book . But any one who has come as far as Paul Crump is a hard man to bet against .
