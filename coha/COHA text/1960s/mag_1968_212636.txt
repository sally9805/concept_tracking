There is no doubt that chloramphenicol , better known by Parke , Davis &; Co. ' s trade name of Chloromycetin , is a potent and valuable antibiotic . That has been clear since 1947 , when it was found to kill a wider variety of bacteria than penicillin or other early antibiotics . Better yet , it was one of the first drugs to show activity against some odd ball microbes called rickettsiae . But Chloromycetin soon showed another side of its character : a few patients developed a severe anemia after taking it , and by 1952 it was clear that some of these patients had died as a result . The question arose : Under what conditions should doctors go on prescribing it ? <P> Last week the Chloromycetin controversy boiled up again in hearings before the Senate Monopoly Subcommittee . Expert medical witnesses agreed that serious and fatal reactions to Chloromycetin are relatively rare . The University of Illinois ' Dr. William R. Best suggested that only one patient out of 20,000 or even 100,000 might develop them . Dr. William Dameshek of Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one in 10,000 . Either way , it sounds few enough . But so many Americans took Chloromycetin that by 1964 the American Medical Association counted 298 U.S. cases of serious reaction , approximately half of them fatal . The California State Department of Public Health has adopted a compromise fatality rate of one in 60,000 . Since 40 million Americans are believed to have taken the drug , that would work out at 666 deaths . <P> Typhoid &; Typhus . Chloromycetin also saves lives , and in some cases when no other drug is likely to do so . How many ? Most medical opinion holds that Chloromycetin is just about the best drug against psittacosis ( " parrot fever " ) , of which there has been a recent median of 60 U.S. cases a year ; against typhoid and paratyphoid fevers , a total of 484 cases ; murine typhus , 33 cases ; Rocky Mountain spotted fever , 263 cases ; one form of meningitis caused by Hemophilus bacilli , exact number of cases not known , but probably less than 2,000 . <P> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more common in tropical and underdeveloped countries than in the U.S. , most of Parke , Davis ' huge sales of the antibiotic ( up to $86 million in 1960 , $72 million in 1966 ) have been in domestic prescriptions . For what ? Far too often , testified Dr. Best , for the common cold and similar viral infections ( for which no drug is of any use ) , and against many bacterial infections for which safer drugs are just as effective . Dr. Dameshek added acne to the list of conditions for which Chloromycetin should not be prescribed .
