At its most highfalutin , the goal of Soviet education is " men and women of noble spirit and lofty ideals who will serve their people selflessly . " But Russian schools do not inevitably produce bright-eyedc " builders of Communist society " - not in a land of war orphans and working mothers . Three years ago Nikita Khrushchev ordered a Pavlovian solution : boarding schools in which " engineers of the soul " could hatch a new elite under ideal laboratory conditions . By last week Russia had more than 500 such new schools , with an enrollment of 360,000 students . " The time is not far off , " Khrushchev has gloated , " when all our children will be raised in boarding schools-provided their parents agree . " <P> The hedge is advisable , for most Russian parents need persuasion . Despite the Communist edict that mothers stick to bearing and let the state do the rearing , Russians prefer more ancient practice-and so do their preachers . Khrushchev 's own grandchildren are not in boarding schools , nor are those of his Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , e.g. , overlarge families . Russians able to support their children do not easily surrender them , and the millions of Russians who still place God above Marx may never do so . By this year 's end , Russia will have more than 700,000 boarding students ; in five years it expects 2.500,000 such students from age 7 to 17 . But day schoolers ( now 31 million ) probably will long outnumber them and delay Khrushchev 's prophecy . <P> Psychology &; Chinese . Nonetheless , boarding schools are Russia 's most significant new educational wrinkle . Their graduates will soon be the nation 's anointed . This is clear from the life being led by 250 first-to-eighth graders at Moscow 's new Boarding School No. 2 in the quiet suburb of Pokrovsko-Streshnevo , one of 46 such schools in the Moscow area . Already No. 2 's students ( 65% boys ) are impressive specimens , honed by top-notch teachers , and one " upbringer " ( counselor ) for every 15 children . <P> No. 2 's students hit the deck every morning at 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until lights out at 9 or 9:30 p.m . There is no time for mental slouching . All boarding-school students , for example , major together in one foreign language ( first choice : English ) from second grade . But No. 2 's students have a rockier road to mastery than most : they grapple with Chinese . All studies fill 4 hours of formal classes and up to two hours of homework , six days a week .
