" Why are you going to Washington ? " She turns her head to look at him sideways . " I told you , my father has to work there , and . . " " No . I said why are you going ? " Her voice is hardening now . But he only stares . She wraps her fingers around the beam and leans away , and swings around it , passing through the wall into the next room and then through the wall again and back to where she began , very slowly , holding Anomaly softly against her thigh . When she is still again , she says in a much lower tone , " When you get to Washington you must immediately go to see your Senator . " He is surprised . " Why ? " " To complain , of course . " " What . about ? " He dares to be faintly an-noyed . " Anything you like . " She smiles . " About the world situation . " And then she laughs . Now he is confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Senators . They 're busy . " She is pleased because she has hoped he would say that . " Oh , yes you can , " very deliberately . You just go to their office and you say you want to see them and they have to come and talk with you , no matter where they are . " " Why ? " he asks unhappily , not believing her and yet painfully aware that he can not refute her . " Because , " she announces , " you are an American ! " She swings herself around the beam again as this information penetrates , and then qualifies her words , very slowly and softly . " Of course it is absolutely necessary that one be sophisticated and able to carry on an intelligent discussion . You , unfortunately , are not , and therefore I am afraid you will have to abandon the entire project . And besides you wo n't even have any Senators because you will be in the District of Columbia . " He is left with the confused impression that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , and that she has somehow demonstrated his foolishness , but that does not seem quite correct either , and so he says nothing , but begins to nudge his foot . carefully toward the edge of a board lying in front of him , to see how close he can come to it without touching . " What kind of a house are you going to have ? " she asks , bringing Anomaly up under her chin and peering at him over the animal 's head . " Du n no , " he murmurs , distractedly . His foot a story by Martha MacNeal 93 is very close to the edge of the board now and he is concentrating intensely . " If you are moving you ought at least to know what kind of a house you are going to have . Especially in Washington , " she intones ominously . He does not challenge her . There is a silence during which both become aware of the pervading texture of darkness , and of the weird pallor of moonlight . Her friend finds it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and moves it with shocking noise , and he starts back , aware that she is watching him in a kind of triumph . Fred drops from his hand with a very soft pathetic plop . He stoops absurdly and retrieves the animal and stands up to find her now very close to him , so that he can see her teeth gleaming white , and her eyes . " Do you know , " she observes , " that you will never see me again ? You will get old and die without ever seeing me again ? " He is frightened , and only shifts uncomfortably , trying to rearrange himself after the inconvenience of having had to stoop , and he moves his mouth vaguely and wants very much to go home . " You will never see me again , " she repeats , watching him . He looks down at the abominable board . She begins to move , walking around the room , weaving in and out of the beams between the rooms with a noiseless step , her arms white in the moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pauses for a moment to toss Anomaly up and catch him again , After a time she approaches her friend , waits for a hush to gather itself around them and then asks softly , " So ? Do you love me ? " He stares at her , astounded and terrified . She waits . Finally , " I . . s'pose so , " he whispers . She straightens up to her full height . " Well , then , what are you going to give me ? " He searches wildly about the room with his eyes . " I have n't anything left ... it 's all packed . . we 're moving away ! " " What about Fred ? " Very softly now . " Oh no . " He is horrified , and pleads . " Oh no . He 's mine , I came to get him , he 's going to go with me , he 's mine . . . " But she only watches him very coldly , as if in possession of an absolute logic , and at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , limp creature into her hand . She holds the two animals , Anomaly and Fred together , observing her friend analytically , and they stand so for a long time and the beams of the half-house gleam . Then , suddenly , in a last desperate assault , he demands . " So ? Do I get Anomaly ? " " Nn , " she says reasonably . He stares at her and then she smiles and says very gently and affectionately , " Goodbye . " He walks over to the edge of the floor , glances hack at her once , and then scrambles down furiously and is gone . It is not long before the last sound of his running steps fades into interminable dark distances . No breeze stirs . It is as if all children have vanished from the earth forever . She sits quietly in the center of the floor . Anomaly and Fred in her arms bulge softly and say nothing . If she breathes at all it is without sound or movement . After a long time , she lays the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark half-house , collecting scraps of cardboard , rags , shavings , empty paper cement-bags , scraps of burlap , small boards . From her pocket she extricates an indispensable knife and tests the blade thoughtfully against her thumb , and then strips from the edges of each beam long splinters of pale , dry wood . Nothing protests ; the half-house only waits as she cuts into it , and through the beams of the roof the night and the stars only wait and the road outside stops still and does not go anywhere . By the time her work is finished , she has gathered a fine large pile of materials , and carefully sets to arranging them , the light paper crumpled on the bottom , then the heavier paper , the cardboard , and the rags , then a mound of the fresh splinters covering that , and finally , on top , the heavier bits of board . Then from her pocket she draws out matches . strikes them one by one with sudden sharp rasps and flares , and sets them to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly in smoke , catch , and begin to crackle . As the smoke begins to rise uniformly and the subdued glow to distinguish itself into surer flames , she takes up Anomaly and Fredfrom where she has left them and carefully lays them on top of the pyre , their eyes staring open and expressionless up through the roof . Now smoke obscures them , the fire grows strong and yellow and they disappear within it , and the shadows of the beams of the half-house break out suddenly across the lit floor away from her , starting and shifting in different directions as the shapes of the fire change . The smoke curls upwards , around and through the beams of the second floor in long , twisting spirals , and up through the rooms above and out through the roof into the night , and the light of the fire as she watches glows and shudders over her face and shines , reflected twice , deep in the black centers of her eyes . She sits and tends the fire with care , waiting and watching as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the shadows and darkness move tentatively back , as into an area abandoned because of danger . gathering again softly and more surely . At last there is only a deep , red glow , but still she does not move , only sits with her arms over her knees , bending her face closer and closer as the heat decreases , waiting for the last light to extinguish itself in the exhaustion of ashes . When this has been accomplished , she takes a stick which she had saved from the fire makings , and pokes about in the soft black center of debris until she finds , one by one , thick clots of cotton stuffing not completely burned . These she draws out of the heap and examines closely , probing with her fingers in little sensitive thrusts , until at last she has found what she wants . With her knife she carefully separates from the clinging threads of cotton the two blackened , bubbly , hardened lumps of burnt plastic that are Anomaly 's eyes . She takes them in her hand and turns from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room of the half-house , and she walks very softly to the edge of the floor where the moonlight shines between the beams . She kneels , and precisely places on the palely lighted boards the hardened intelligence of Anomaly 's eyes , bends forward and down , and stares into them with her own . A Few Kind Words for Uncle Tom by Irving Kristol When the Negro has achieved equality , he will still have to establish a satisfactory sense of his own identity .. . Poor Uncle Torn : his posthumous destiny has been even more cruel and unjust than his fictional one . Over the years his very name has become a synonym for servility and cowardice , so that for any Negro now to be branded " an Uncle Tom " is to suffer a public humiliation of the most devastating kind . In fact , this process has gone so far  --  and the new orthodoxy is now so firmly established  --  that no one any longer seems aware of the enormous irony of it all . For ironic it most certainly is . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's Cabin and responded to it as to no other novel in our history , Uncle Tom was regarded ( one might even say worshiped ) as a symbol of human nobility . He was meant , of course , to be such a symbol by his creator , and was celebrated as such by the antislavery movement . Conceded , Uncle Torn was no abolitionist rebel . But he was , for his contemporaries , something a little more important than that : he was a Christian . He was , indeed  --  and still remains  --  the only true and most perfect Christian in all American literature . If none reproached him for not demanding his freedom , it was because he evidently already possessed it  --  that inner transcendent freedom which all noble souls possess , and which the human race will never cease to venerate so long as it venerates anything beyond its material self . Uncle Tom  --  like the Negro spiritual  --  testifies to the fact that , even while they were in slavery , the Negroes never really were slaves . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantasm of Harriet Beecher Stowe 's fevered imagination ; and that is why Mrs. Stowe was triumphant to be able to report , as she did , that more correspondents verified the authenticity of Uncle Tom than of any other character in the novel . But that was yesterday  --  and , as it were , in another country . Though sociologists inform us that Americans still go to church as regularly as ever they did , it is obvious that we are today far less a Christian nation than ever we were . Turning the other cheek is so far out of fashion as to be utterly out of mind . We are all activists now , and can not imagine any other appropriate response to oppression and injustice than militant protest . Witness the agonizing discussion among Jews of Hitler 's slaughter of the innocents  --  so many people seem to think it less than human , rather than more , for a man to go to his death calmly praying rather than kicking and cursing . 96 A FEW KIND WORDS FOR UNCLE TOM There is no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that most American history textbooks are now being frantically revised  --  and , if necessary , the truth a little stretched  --  in the perspective of the Negro 's current struggle for equality and equal rights . From having been a passive element in American history , the Negro is being transformed into an active agent in the struggle for democracy , liberty , and  --  most important  --  his own emancipation . The handful of Negro slave revolts is now receiving solicitous and emphatic attention ; the role of Negroes in the Reconstruction era is given every possible positive emphasis . That practically all previous historians did not see American Negro history in this light is blandly attributed to racist prejudice . At the same time , much of what was traditionally thought to be Negro history is now being ruthlessly slighted  --  witness the fate not only of the fictional Uncle Tom , but of the very real Booker T. Washington . Only a little while ago , Booker T. Washington was generally recognized as a great leader of his people . Now he is dismissed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is , when he is not derided as a kind of Quisling . Much of this animus derives  --  as Professor Howard Brotz has recently shown  --  from a highly imperfect appreciation of both the historical situation in which he worked ( not anticipating the Jim Crow legislation of the 1890s , he had no reason to doubt that the doors to equality were open , once the Negroes were ready and able to pass through them ) and his own intentions vis- ? - vis this situation ( his emphasis on vocational training was aimed at preparing the Southern rural Negroes , who constituted an overwhelming majority , to move up the socioeconomic ladder toward equality ) . But there can be no doubt that much of our current disrespect for Booker T. Washington flows from the simple and incontrovertible fact that he was not , by today 's standards , a " militant . " But is " militancy " everything ? Once upon a time , Booker T. Washington was being visited by a white lady philanthropist . When she left , he accompanied her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly stopped in horrified embarrassment . There , before them , were two Irving Kristoff , born and educated in New York City , was co-founder of " Encounter " magazine in London , and has been associated as an editor with " The Reporter " and " Commentary . " He is now senior editor and executive vice president of Basic Books , Inc. doors : " Whites Only " and " Colored Only . " Washington glanced at them , laughed contemptuously , picked up the lady 's luggage and accompanied her , as her porter , into the white section . There , he continued their conversation as if nothing had happened . A servile action or a noble one ? We hear it said that racial discrimination is a white , not a Negro problem  --  Booker T. Washington really believed it . He thought it prudent to accommodate himself , temporarily , to white idiocy . But in his very act of accommodation , he spiritually transcended all the barriers that hemmed him , and his people , in . One wonders : does he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retrospectively lynched in effigy ? Not Equal , but Superior Something tells me that I had better make it clear , at this point , that I believe the Negro 's struggle for civic equality to be absolutely just , and the use of militant methods in this struggle to be perfectly legitimate . What does worry me is the kind of self-defeating fanaticism that this kind of struggle almost inevitably generates . It is right that the Negro should wish to be equal , in all respects , to the white man . But something has gone wrong if Negroes  --  and their white liberal allies  --  seem unable to realize that the Uncle Toms and Booker T. Washingtons were not equal to their white contemporaries only because they were superior to them . No man can achieve an authentic equality  --  no man can even achieve an authentic identity  --  if , in the effort to do so , he denies his forefathers . That there were Negroes who , in some degree or another , approximated Uncle Tom , strikes me as something that could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy to whites . That . today 's " Negro liberation movement , " in its single-minded emphasis on militant action , fails to perceive this , represents a grave weakness of that movement . It is denying to itself a historical and psychological dimension that is essential for Negro self-understandingand for Negro self-respect . To be sure , this aberration is probably only temporary . One is reminded , in this respect , of the characteristics of Jewish nationalism as it arose in nineteenth-century Europe ( and as it endures , in a muted and diminishing way , in Israel today ) . Here , too , a new nationalism gave way to a new historiography . The traditional view of the Jews as the innocent and suffering
