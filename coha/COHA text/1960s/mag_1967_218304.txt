There is something sad about the death of a dynasty-even one as tyrannical as the Boston Celtics . For most of a decade the Celtics have utterly dominated pro basketball , winning nine National Basketball Association championships and providing the sport with many of its brightest stars : Bob Cousy , Bill Sharman , Tommy Heinsohn , Sam Jones , Bill Russell . It all ended last week when the Philadelphia 76ers rudely knocked the Celtics from the throne , crushing them four games to one in the N.B.A. 's Eastern Division playoffs . <P> Boston was never really in the battle , and the reason for that was Wilt Chamberlain .
