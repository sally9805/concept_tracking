In an age of instant Telstar TV images and photojournalism , the role of portraiture , once a mainstay of the painter 's profession , often seems to have fallen by the wayside . But when Parliament decided to honor Winston Church ill on his 80th birthday , it instinctively turned to one of England 's finest artists , Graham Sutherland . Churchill loathed the result , kept the oil hidden away . Still , when Churchill died , the public turned to Sutherland 's image , saw in its pugnacious , bulldog mien the true essence of their wartime leader . <P> One of man 's greatest challenges is facing himself ; in today 's portraiture the encounter has become stranger and stranger . Freed from the chore of sticking slavishly to the surface likeness , the artist today is free to probe more than skin-deep . The result often produces a psychological study in depth that eludes even the roving camera 's eye . Or , in the instance of Raphael Soyer 's Homage to Thomas Eakins ( opposite ) , it can bring to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unifying vision of one man who knew and admired them all . <P> Biographer as Surgeon . Soyer 's group portrait is essentially a salute to the past , an evocation of his fellow realists and their combined debt to Eakins as the greatest painter in the American realist tradition . Soyer unabashedly searched the past for precedent , modeled his composition on Fantin-Latour 's 1864 Homage to Delacroix . He prepared himself by making separate portraits of each figure from life , except for the late Reginald Marsh , whom Soyer had painted 24 years earlier ; he simply copied the old portrait into the final 6-ft. 8-in. by 7-ft. 4-in. canvas . <P> The only non-artist in the final painting is Lloyd Goodrich , director of Manhattan 's Whitney Museum of American Art , who was included for his definitive biography of Eakins . He stands behind a table , paralleling the posture of the surgeon in Eakins ' The Gross Clinic , over his shoulder . " To relieve the grimness , " Soyer posed his only daughter bringing in a tray of drinks . <P> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might fail . He jotted in his progress notes : " Will I be able to capture the tremor in the temples of Jack Levine 's portrait , the anxious face of Moses Soyer 's twin brother , or the aura of aloneness about Edward Hopper ? " In the end , he largely succeeded , but says Soyer : " The secret of doing big group paintings has been lost . Portraits painted today are fragmentary , personal , capricious , nervous , tentative , incomplete , accidental , at times full of inaccuracies . But they are fascinating-revealing of the artist more than of the subject he paints . " <P> Artist as Analyst . A spate of recent shows has established that contemporary portraits are two-way mirrors . Larry Rivers makes a collage portrait of Pop Artist Jim Dine on a metal storm window . Raise the bottom half , lower the top pane , and presto , a different Dine peers through . Pop Artist Andy Warhol tries to beat the penny-arcade snapshot by silk-screening the image many times over . Reginald Pollack found he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page ) shows his face surrounded by images of the girl he was then courting . She outnumbers him 6 to 1 , and she got the message ; when the portrait was done , she married Pollack.
