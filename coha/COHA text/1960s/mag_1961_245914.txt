THE ODYSSEY ( 474 pp. ) - Homer , translated by Robert Fitzgerald - Doubleday ( $4.95 ) . <P> On first looking into Fitzgerald 's Homer , the modern reader will be less astonished than was Keats when he looked into Chapman's. * Poet Robert Fitzgerald has again put into English the very old story of the most indestructible of Greeks . Odysseus was a very Greek hero , " formidable for guile in peace and war , " " the great tactician , ' ' " skilled in all ways of contending , " " all craft and gall , " admired as much for his divinely inspired chicanery as for his handiwork with spear , bow or tiller . Although favored by Pallas Athena , he was not a superhuman figure but a very mortal man , in his own words as rendered by Fitzgerald : <P> . . . a most unlikely god am I , being all of earth and mortal nature . <P> I should say , rather , I am like those men who suffer the worst trials that you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should reassure the suspicious modern that Homer 's epic is not a supernatural swindle but the narrative of a man in trouble-the " first novel , " as one translator put it-and that Fitzgerald 's English version is in the crisp demotic argot of today . The new translation , however , does not skip or try to improve on the few familiar Homeric cliches : the sea is still " wine-dark " or " fish-cold " ; the dawn is still " rosy-fingered . " <P> The Wolf Pack . For those who came in late-a great many people educated at colleges with elective curriculums-The Odyssey is the story of the long voyage home from the Trojan Wars of Odysseus , lord of Ithaca , to be reunited with his wife Penelope and son Telemachus . On the way , he and his men suffered such ordeals as imprisonment by brutish cannibal giants , shipwreck , seduction , famine and feast . Meanwhile , back at the palace , a half-hundred soft civilians squatted on the absent lord 's domain , eating and drinking their heads off , seducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor of consoling the presumed widow . The whole bloody and wonderful business ends when Odysseus , disguised as a beggar , first humiliates the suitors in a contest at archery , then slaughters the whole " wolf pack " of them , hangs the faithless female help , washes off the blood , makes love to Penelope , restores his son to honor and sets his little kingdom to rights .
