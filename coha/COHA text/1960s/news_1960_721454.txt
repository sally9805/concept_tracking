txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 22 ? The historic independence of Rhode Island may account for the fact that its primary to choose candidates for the United States Senate occurs on the late date of Sept. 28 . This deviation from the normal is typical of the state , the smallest in the Union , which ratified the Constitution only by two votes , and after Congress threatened to sever its ' communications with the United States ; and which neither adopted nor observed the Eighteenth Amendment . The laws of Louisiana , Georgia and Hawaii provide for Senatorial primaries in October ( runoffs , if necessary , in the first two ) . The primary in Rhode Island becomes the last of the species in 1960 . And the three-cornered contest is lively enough to justify the exclusive billing . Its briskness has reached a point of acrimony which impelled Senator Pastore , whose term does not end until 1965 ; to make the following plea to a noisily divided group of Democrats a few days ago : I say here very frankly I do n't like too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers * * * they do n't sound like they are coming from good , loyal Democrats . * * * There is no reason for Democrats to be tearing themselves apart . * * * Let 's not have the scars we had two years ago when a Republican was elected Governor . The fraternal fracas which Pastore deplores was incited because two of the Senatorial aspirants are re-fighting an old feud , and a young newcomer is attempting an end run around them while so engaged . The veterans are former Gov . Dennis J. Roberts , whose candidacy has been endorsed by the State Committee , and Howard , who is former almost everything distinguished in government and politics . Not only has he been Governor of Rhode Island , but Senator , Solicitor-General and Attorney General of the United States and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee . Sacrificed to political exigency by a reluctant and unhappy President Truman , wants to return to Washington as the Senator he used to be . The young newcomer to politics on the grand Senatorial level is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on major international commissions . Since it is impossible for any Democrat in Rhode Island to claim more devotion than another to Senator John F. Kennedy , and it means political death by fiendish torture to be suspected of less , Pell is seeking another way to link himself in the voters ' mind with the party Presidential candidate . This is to accent his membership in Kennedy 's Second World War generation ( Pell is 41 as contrasted with Roberts ' 58 and 's 57 ) , and to echo Kennedy 's call for new , young , vigorous men to march behind him to ' The New Frontier . " A Pell Idea All three candidates , however , appear to be united on the policies for the future of the country that were pledged by the national Democratic party in its Los Angeles platform and on its criticisms of the Eisenhower Administration . An expansion is Pell 's own sensible blueprint of the platform 's proposal for " a national peace agency . " He would shrink this into a State Department bureau , headed by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State in the conduct of foreign affairs for the President . But this plan is not likely to inflame the imagination of the people of Rhode Island to the point of marching under banners with the legend : " Pell and Peace by Bureau : Down with the Departmentalists ! " Pell must rely on the appeals of his youth , personality , and his downright cheek in asking Rhode Island voters to start his elective career as a Senator of the United States . However effective these may prove , the reports from the battle in the land of the quahog , the lobster and the textile mill are that he is a big worry to his two veteran rivals . The chief danger to both Pell and is that they may split the . anti-Roberts vote by a division : which would assure Roberts ' nomination . Each has expressed the kind- : ly wish that the other would get the hell out so that the survivor could be sure to clobber the perennial Dennis . To this suggestion ! from Pell to a Democrat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for Rob-1 erts , he likes things the way they are .
