There is something about success in art that leads artists to appreciate the kind of surroundings that success on Wall Street leads stockbrokers to appreciate . If in midsummer 1964 it became necessary to page 150 ranking painters and sculptors , the place to go would be the Hamptons on the eastern end of Long Island , an area best known as a golfing , sailing , tennis-playing , tanning and drinking preserve for the rich . A 40-mile stretch of sea , sand and shore towns , the Hamptons have attracted artists ever since the 1870s , when Winslow Homer went there to paint impressionistic oils of ladies dipping their toes in the surf . Last week the art colony was at its midseason busiest . The oldest colonial , visionary Architect Frederick Kiesler , 67 , was at work on a 46-ft. sculpture despite a recent heart attack . Sculptor Costantino Nivola , 53 , a swarthy Sardinian who likes to cast concrete abstracts in a huge sand pit on his 40-acre property , was busy making a small sculpture of Kiesler . <P> An Abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house in the area and says he likes the Hamptons for a special reason : the marine and farmers ' hardware in local stores . " I 've bought more than 20 axes to put in my new assemblages , " he reported . " If I 'd bought them in Manhattan , the store clerks would have turned me in as an ax murderer . " <P> The artists of the Hamptons form anything but a school . Alexander Brook still paints tender nudes from life , works in a former stable in the old whaling town of Sag Harbor , and putts around in his Model T and 1935 Rolls-Royce . Realists such as Fairfield Porter , Paul Georges and Moses Soyer live within a short drive of Abstractionists Ludwig Sander , Corrado Marca-Relli and James Brooks . Even New Yorker Cartoonists Charles Addams and Saul Steinberg find the region warmly inclusive . <P> A De Kooning House . Architect Gordon Bunshaft , chief designer and partner in Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill , has built a small concrete and marble pavilion overlooking an inshore bay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dune where Jacqueline Kennedy used to play when she was a subdeb Bouvier . The Hamptons ' most illustrious and most retiring painter , Willem de Kooning , turned architect and built his own house-over and over again . A huge , $150,000-plus modern mansion with all the daring angularity of De Kooning 's art , it has a 30-ft. - high studio and a sauna in the basement , but it is still unfinished after four years of continuous construction , destruction and rebuilding . <P> Sculptor Ibram Lassaw believes that the merit of the Hamptons for artists is just that they can find a studio here . " Painter Lucia Wilcox , who used to turn fish thrown away by local fishermen into bouillabaisse for Max Ernst , Jean Hlion and Fernand Lger when they were war refugees in the Hamptons , says , " I am crazy about the sky . It 's like Paris . " City Landscapist Jane Wilson likes the change . Moreover , Art lives comfortably with Wealth . Adolph Gottlieb is a neighbor to one of the U.S. 's richest in-surancemen . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brokers out here , ' I 'm a painter , ' they understand . They are interested in art . "
