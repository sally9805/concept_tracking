The words sounded for all the world like the stage directions for an old-fashioned vaudeville demonstration of hypnosis : " You are going to relax , and the feeling of relaxation will start in your scalp . When you feel this , one of your fingers will feel like lifting . That will be your ' Yes ' finger . Then your eyes will feel relaxed , your mouth and lips will feel soft , and your ' Yes ' finger will lift . " The speaker works downward in a sort of hyp tease , through jaw , neck and shoulders , arms , chest , and abdomen , thighs , legs and feet . " When you feel relaxation in your toes , your ' No ' finger will feel like lifting . Whichever finger it is , let it lift . " <P> Whatever it sounds like , this is not a stage show . The hypnotist uses no eye fixation in the manner of the traditional mesmerist , and the performance is in the office of a reputable San Francisco psychiatrist , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Lowering the Barriers . Once he has his patient hypnotized , Psychiatrist Richard A. Kunin , 31 , works with the system of " ideomotor responses " ( finger signals to indicate answers and reactions ) developed by Obstetrician David B. Cheek , a fellow San Franciscan . Dr. Cheek finds that a mere nod or shake of the head during hypnosis is a relatively conscious effort that can cloud what the subject is recalling ; finger signals , sometimes so slight that the psychiatrist can perceive them only as the tensing of a tendon on the back of the hand , work at a deep , subconscious level , and do not interfere with communication . <P> Dr. Kunin 's first session is devoted to getting the patient relaxed , and suggesting to him while he is still hypnotized that he will be able to relax in the same manner any time he chooses . At the next session , Dr. Kunin says : " Turn your thoughts to a pleasant scene-a mountain , a beach or a woodland-and picture it to yourself . See yourself there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ' finger lift . " <P> The important thing is for the patient to visualize the scene . Dr. Kunin feels that too many people do not " see with the mind 's eye , " but think about things in near-abstract terms , which are not good enough for psychotherapy . When the patient has pictured the pleasant scene of his choice , Dr. Kunin asks him to recall a previous occasion when he was in a similar situation , and to describe it , along with his feelings about it . If the therapist interrupts with questions , the finger lifts are sufficient answers , and they do not break the chain of the patient 's associations . <P> Later , the patient is asked to picture a future situation that he dreads , and to rehearse what he will do to draw its sting . " If we ask an alcoholic to project himself into a picture where he is in a drinking situation , " says Dr. Kunin , " he can link his ' No ' response with all his visual images of self-deterioration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the patient can call up such images himself in time of need . The maneuver , says Dr. Kunin , can give him aid and support , so that he can refuse the drinks that an oversolicitous host is pressing him to accept , while further talk-it-out therapy helps him to resolve his underlying emotional problems .
