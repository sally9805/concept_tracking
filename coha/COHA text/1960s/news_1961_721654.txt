txt The biggest current export from this primitive , rebellion-torn land is words . Press cables filed by newspaper , magazine and wire agency reporters covering this latest Russian-backed Communist uprising have become the Royal Lao government 's chief dollar earner . Cable receipts for 1960 have not been fully tallied , but they should easily ? top 1959 earnings of $233,000 . Li that year , also one of Red uprising , cable tolls were second to tin exports of $316,000 . However , some weeks ago French technicians operating the country 's only two tin mines in southerly Khammoune Province decided they had had enough of Communist terrorism and fled back to France , halting Laos ' tin production and exports . All of this points up the minuscule scale of the Laotian economy of 2 million people , thinly spread over an area of jungle and mountain slightly larger than kansas . Here barter is the chief form of rural commerce and even agriculture features crude ancient techniques that hold food supplies to mere subsistence levels . U.S. Aid Supports Army U.S. aid , $33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years , dwarfs this simple economy . Though there 's hardly a trace of this , money in the vast countryside , pearly American cash grants run higher than the value of all Laotian kip in circulation . American aid pays the entire $18.1 million annual cost of running the 29,000-man Royal Lao army , nearly all of the $2.7 million police budget and more than one third of the $14 million civil government budget . Some $5 million annually also has been going into development projects such as road construction , irrigation , education and disease prevention . " All we are really buying here is an army , impossibly large for Laos to support alone but still too weak to defeat the Communist rebels , " comments an American aid official . American aid to Laos includes military hardware such as howitzers , carbines , mortars , trucks and aircraft , most of it World War II surplus . U.S. Army people here wo n't divulge the value or quantity of such aid . ' By .. contrast , Laos ' . Own , commercial exports , total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to the . Laotian kip , freely convertible at 80 to the U.S. dollar , as one of the strongest currencies in the world . The reason : The 1.6 billion kip in circulation are backed 100% by U.S. dollars  --  that is , by $20 million in Laotian treasury reserves . Long-Range Projects Abandoned But now with most of the northern and central countryside in Communist rebel hands , American economic aid technicians generally find it impossible to continue their work . Ac , cording to John H. Tobler , director of the International Cooperation Administration mission to Laos , the U.S. is abandoning most of its slow-moving , long-range economic projects , which cost about $5 million yearly , in favor of stop-gap assistance . Despite the whittled down economic program , Uncle Sam is likely to spend more , not less , on Laos in the next year . The biggest reason : Active military operations have sharp . ' ly inflated U.S. outlays for running the Lao army . Furthermore , a good deal of the military equipment supplied the Lao army by the U.S. has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being turned against the ' pro-Western forces ; presumably this equipment must be replaced . Military requirements are not the only reason for the anticipated increase in U.S. spending , however . A steep decline in customs revenue , caused by last year 's four-month blockade of the overland supply route from Bangkok , means the U.S. must kick in $2 million or 53 million extra- to the civil budget . Moreover , the flight of many - frightened town folk into the jungle or even out of Laos has cut the demand for Imports , businessmen here say , and consequently has reduced current customs revenue . Such revenue is the government 's chief source of local funds . In trimming its program , the I.C.A . is cutting its 118-man staff here to , 40 , few enough to be evacuated in one plane if the rebels close in . The mission 's administrative staff of 30 will now be stationed lin Bangkok . The I.C.A . decided on this sharply slimmed down program , Mr. Tobler says , " rather than do nothing . " Right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something for the civilian populace . " Now 29 Americans will assist the royal government in assorted emergency rehabilitation projects in areas around principal towns that are free from rebels . They will patch up such breakdowns as dynamited bridges and disrupted electric power facilities . The U.S. will send in rice and Medical supplies as needed . About the only development work this mission will do is assist occasionally in the " village self-help " program : Showing villages how to dig better wells , plan a market place or build an access road . The U.S. will provide some cement , nails , tools and construction equipment to further this program . Teacher Training ? The biggest single U.S. aid project here to date is the $1 million National Education Center in Vientiane for teacher training and vocational instruction . It can handle 500 students at a time . Nine Americans will stay on here as educational advisers . Finally , another two Yankee technicians will run a construction equipment repair yard outside the capital . Some of what the U.S. has given Laos , not surprisingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medical dispensaries , irrigation ditches and wells built with American aid in the central and northern jungle villages are now under Red control . The country 's only concrete irrigation dam , a U.S.-made structure spanning a stream near Ban Ban village ( 95 miles east of the royal capital , Luang Prabang ) , was captured a couple of weeks ago ' in a rebel advance . Somewhat more embarrassing is the amount of American military equipment , including rifles , mortars and ammunition , regularly captured from Communist rebels . Some of it undoubtedly is left over from the Indo-China war which ended in 1954 . But much was looted from government arsenals by Capt . Kong Le 's crack royal paratroop battalion which defected to the Communist side last month . Today the U.S. and the Soviet bloc are battling over a country that the French , who colonized it in the 2890 's , regarded as little more than a hunting preserve for giers ( large birds ) and other game . It was of more value to France politically then as a buffer state between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber plantations and extensive mineral deposits , and British-dominated Thailand . Ideally Laos  --  whose full , independence was recognized in 1954 in the Indo-China ' war truce ? today could serve again as a neutralist buffer between Communist North Vietnam and China and anti-Communist Thailand , South Vietnam and neutralist Cambodia . But the latest outbreak of Communist rebel warfare has ruled this out for the moment . Economic Weakness Economically , Laos is not exactly a treasure chest . There are no known mineral deposits other than a little tin and perhaps a bit of gold in the north . Nomadic tribal farming is carried on by clearing a section of forest land , planting one crop of rice and then moving on to another area'where the land still is fertile . Almost no fertilizer or insecticides are used . Besides rice , Laos grows some short-staple cotton , vegetables and tropical fruits , a little coffee for export and poppies to make opium . The opium is widely smoked here and illegally exported . Most Laotian villages , such as Tha Thom , 95 miles northeast of Vientiane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent and rebel forces , are accessible only by foot paths hacked into hilly jungle . Here illiterate natives live in dusty bamboo huts containing no furniture and built on high stilts as protection against summertime floods and maraudipg animals and snakes . Their diet is mostly rice , supplemented by locally grown peppers , cucumbers , papayas and bananas plus some fish caught in nearby streams and per , haps an occasional duck egg . Barter Is the Rule Money is used only in larger , less selfsufficient villages and towns ; everywhere else barter is the rule . For example , the Meo tribes in the north  --  they are one of the many minority tribal groups that make up half of the Laos population ? do not spin or weave cotton but they have plenty of salt . So they 'll trade with village which makes sarongs . A grown pig is worth a man 's shirt and a village midwife may charge 10 pounds of rice to deliver a baby . Sometimes produce is traded for gold or jewelry , the only generalform of savings . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French did build some roads , schools , power stations and hospitals . But to this day Laos has made no attempt to build up industry . The . country boasts one soft drink bottling plant , one medium size rice mill and a few auto and bicycle repair shops . The sole cigaret factory burned down during recent fighting in Vientiane . All other things , such as clothes and simple farm tools , are either produced in peasants ' homes or are imported . And it 's U.S.-financed imports which indirectly support the outsize army and police . The U.S. Government deposits around $25 million yearly in New York banks for the account of the Laos government . The Laos government then deposits an equivalent amount of hips in a counterpart fund here to be drawn upon for military and civil government use . Eventually these funds , spent by soldiers , government employes and businesses serving the government , find their way into the hands of importers who cash them in for dollars and import foreign commodities . The system balances out well enough that the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed . Last year 's $25 million worth of imported commodities included processed foods , cheap textiles , medicines , machinery , radios and automobiles . The kip is freely convertible and all imports are encouraged  --  even luxuries such as French wines , stereo phonographs and Mercedes Benz automobiles . All of these items bring kip to the government in exchange for dollars but rarely leave the capital of Vientiane . Until late 1958 Laos controlled its kip at an artificial rate of 35 to the American dollar . far above its free market value , and regulated imports through a licensing system . This merely led to widespread corruption and misuse of aid dollars by encouraging currency specula. tioh . Merchants could purchase dollars at the official rate through their import licenies and then sell them on the open market for a big profit . With full convertibility and free trade such abuses have largely disappeared . Laos businessmen now complain of a " recession " ? meaning , says one trader , that illicit profiteer. ing has gone . No one here seriously doubts that some graft continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far more moderate scale than before . The great bulk of Laos imports , of course , stay in the major towns and cities ; small vit. lages are fairly self-sufficient and do not need Most foreign goods . American officials fret over what will happen here when U.S. aid declines or stops , eliminating the imported products that many relatively prosperous town folk are accustomed to . The inevitable lowered living standard could have serious political repercussions .
