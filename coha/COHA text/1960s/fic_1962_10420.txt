store business , he had to hide it sometimes . Miners were plungers , ready to buy far more than they could ever hope to pay for . Tradesmen had to call payday or the day after to collect what pittance they could , and in the summer with no pay at all coming in and overdrawn at the Company store , miners had to be kept in reasonable limits . But today he had no reservations , nothing to hold back from them . They could come and take from him the bread and water of life freely . " Harry Donner ! " Pete Conningham said when his turn came to shake hands . " They said you might be coming but I did n't believe them . " " He 's a Reverend now , Pete ! " Tom corrected . " I know it , " Pete said .

Hi , Father , ' said one . He 's no father , ' said the other . He 's got four kids . ' Now wait a minute . I have another while we 're on the subject . My cousin came over on the Immigration and wrote home from Shenandoah to my Uncle Pete , the one I 'm named after . Uncle Pete , it 's a wonderful country over here . I 'm tearing down a Protes/tant church and getting paid for it . ' Now do n't take offense , Reverend . Come in and see Katie before you go . You do n't need to mention you 're Catholic or Protestant . I wo n't and she wo n't either . " " I 'll do that , Pete , " Preacher Donner said . " How 's Mike ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend , " Jim Doran said . " The women are fanning him for breath now . Annie was up with him most of the night . " He could hear Mike breathing when he got to the door . It almost struck him in the face , a loud whistling and wheezingthat should n't come from a human being . And could that be Mike Barrett himself , propped up in bed in the little parlor behind the storeroom , a wreck of a man wasted away to his bones , frail and transparent as glass , his hair turned to a kind of tarnished silver ? It was a shock to remember him as he used to be , filled with life and the devil . When he came home from work evenings , they said , he would dance a jig by himself on the back porch , and him black as the ace of spades , his eyes white and sparkling with the Old Nick . He 'd whistle his own tune to dance to , a hornpipe or the " Irish Washerwoman . " And him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours then . He claimed he danced for his supper . Tom said he thought he danced that he was safe out of the blackness for the day and home to his shanty ,  |p102woman  and young ones . But Sally insisted Mike danced for pure pleasure . She said he 'd sooner dance than eat , that his overalls could be patched but his shoes had to shine . Harry Donner reckoned that Mike 's wife ought to know him best . Most of the men who drilled the rock tunnels tied bandanas over their mouths to keep out the rock and coal dust , but Mike said he was n't ashamed of his face . He could eat rock and live off it . He mocked those who claimed that the coal regions were damned , the mines accursed , that sooner or later a man would get hauled up in a bucket . The mines would never get him . Besides , where else could an Irish lad with blood in his veins from County Mayo earn a dollar and twenty-five cents a day ? Sally saw Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . The look of thanks in her eyes was reward enough for missing Sunday school and walking six miles up the mountain . She had been raised in the country near Unionville . Now she showed him her youngest girl and led him over to the bed . " Harry Donner , me lad ! " Mike Barrett greeted him faintly . " How 'd they ever get a black coat on you , man ? " Talking as little as that made him choke and cough till he brought up some thick black stuff which he spat in the can Sally held for him . Pete Conningham pushed in and took the can from her . " So you know this man , Mike , in his high-church collar ? Reverend , Mike claims he 's County Mayo but he never sawp103it . His father did but his mother was Church of England . So Mike 's neither mackerel nor red herring and you can give him all the holy water you want . Did you ever hear the story , Reverend , of the man from County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , I mean . The king heard about him over in London and sent for him and looked him over . Yes , ' he said , it 's like looking in a mirror . Was your mother ever in England ? ' The County Mayo man never batted an eye . Never , ' he said , but my father was . ' Now do n't take offense at a shady story , Reverend . " Harry Donner tried to draw out his old friend . But Pete did most of the talking , fanning him with Annie Doran 's fan . It took a little time to realize Pete was trying to save Mike from talking and coughing . " It 's a pity Mike never saw Black Sod Bay above Galway , Reverend , or Broadhaven Bay either one . They 're the beauty spots of the world . It 's where the Spanish Armada come ashore and the shipwrecked men stuck around because of the colleens . If you look at Mike you can see the long Spanish face . That 's what makes him such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Except Sally , " Tim Cochran put in , a foolish thing to say with Sally wanting him baptized . Pete Conningham talked on a while trying to let Mike forget it . At the end there was nothing to do but come around toit . Harry Donner laid his hand on the sick man 's shoulder . " I 'd like to baptize you while I 'm here , Mike , " he said.  | " You mean Sally 'd like it ! " Mike jeered . " Well , of course she would . But I 'm your friend and I 'd like it , too . Will you let me do it for you ? " Mike sat there fighting the idea and fighting himself for fighting it . " If Sally wants it , go ahead , " he brought out at last . Harry Donner took the Ministerial Acts from his pocket . The small black book in his hands lent him a sense of holy orders , made him feel suddenly more than himself , taller , of surer authority . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet except for the breathing . Harry Donner opened the book and his voice came out strong with life in this sickroom . " Dearly beloved : forasmuch as our Saviour , Jesus Christ , hath said , Except a man be born of water and the spirit he can not enter the kingdom of God . . It went well enough until the time came to interrogate the candidate . " Dost thou renounce the devil and all his works and all his ways ? " The only answer was an endless fit of coughing with Mike 's eyes mocking him as if to say , " How do you expect me to renounce the devil when he has me by the windpipe ? " Sally waited a long minute , then spoke in a low voice . " Can I answer for him , Reverend ? " Harry Donner considered . After all , Mike and Sally were one according to God 's own word . He supposed it notp105unreasonable . He continued the questions with Sally answeringtill the coughing stopped and Mike answered for himself . The preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it up . " In the name of the Lord Jesus whom thou hast confessed , I hereby declare thee a member of his church and authorize thee to receive the Lord 's supper and to participate in all the spiritual privileges of the church . " He turned so as to face Sally , Annie Doran and the men bunched at the door . " And now I admonish you to acknowledge and receive this man as your brother and heir with you in the Lord and ever to pray for him and that God may perfect the work which He hath begun by His Holy Spirit . The blessings of Almighty God , the Father , the Son and Holy Ghost be with thee always . Amen . " " Amen , " Sally said fervently . When they saw it was over the men at the door pushed back into the room , Pete Conningham in the lead talking . " Do you know , Mike , you 're a bloody Lutheran now ? How will an Irishman get along when he wakes up in purgatoryand finds himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If he could get along with the Dutch for thirty years , Pete Conningham , he wo n't find it any harder over there . " She turned to the preacher . " Can he take communion now , Reverend ? "  | " If he wants it , " Harry Donner said . " We wo n't push him . He does n't need to take it if he does n't want to . " The eyes of the bloodless miner were like pieces of coal . He seemed curiously calmed by the service and unaware of the terrible sucking and whistling sounds from his own chest . He motioned the others to leave . " I know you , Mike Barrett , " Pete Conningham told him . " You want all the wine for yourself . " But he left with the others while Annie Doran and Sally went to the kitchen . The preacher took his silver set from its cloth bag , then tapped on the kitchen door for the bread and wine . The words and heart of the Eucharist ceremony had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscrutable as when he repeated them today to this dying miner propped up in his unpainted Company house on Broad Mountain . " Our Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread ; and when he had given thanks , He brake it and gave it to His disciples saying , Take , eat ; this is my Body which is given for you ; do this in remembrance of Me . " He poured out some of Sally 's wine and put the cup momentarilyto his own lips . " After the same manner also , He took the cup when He had supped , and when He had given thanks , He gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it . This cup is the New Testamentin my Blood which is shed for you and for many , forp107the remission of sins ; this do as oft as ye drink it in remembranceof Me . " At the end Harry Donner closed the little black book . " That prayer was printed in here , Mike . Now I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to . " He knelt by the bed and knotted his hands on the covers . He did not need to think what to say . Words of entreaty and intercession , as seldom came to him in his Mahanoy church , flooded the room . It seemed that he could almost hear his father when as a boy he had listened to him one night long ago pleading in the darkness with the Unseen , his voice rising and falling in slow , imploring , unforgettable German . When he left , Sally tried to press a bill on him . He pushed it back . " You need it yourself , Sally . " " But I want you to come again , Reverend . " He thought he knew what she meant . " Any time , " he told her . " I 'll never forget what you 've done for us . It 's the first time a minister 's been in our house since your wife 's father used to come and see us . " " Well , it need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Call me when you need me . " The truth was , he told himself , that she had done more for him than he for her . It was her summons that had ledp108him here , had let him bring God 's word and sacrament to an old friend in his last bitter hours . More than that , she had opened his eyes to this field of destitution and need lying unseen almost under his nose . At Mahanoy he felt his people were well off in spiritual possessions . They took them all for granted , a church home , religious services four and five times a week , pastoral calls in their houses , religious instructionfor the young . Here in the patches they had nothing of that , neither sheep fold nor shepherd , no Sunday school or altar , no man of God moving among them to remindthem of their heavenly Father who knocked unseen on the doors of their rude houses or of the Holy Spirit ready to descend with the men in the dangerous breasts and headingsof the mines . When he stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some women and children . He sensed a respect he had never felt when out with the store team . Warmly he shook hands with them all . Several asked if he would stop in at their houses to see them . " He 's coming with me first to see Katie , " Pete Conninghambragged . " Then I 'm walking him over to the Lost Run station to catch his train . He 's got to preach in Mahanoy tonight . "  |p109s  a boy Johnny had seldom thought much about hismother . She was too incontrovertible a fact , too familiara substance and being , more real than his own flesh and blood . His likes and loyalties he might question but his mother 's never . There was always this tender rock in ginghamto resort to , always the fine steady gray eyes and sweet smell about her to depend on and reassure . Cordial to most , she was never intimate save to her three sons . With all , there remained a clement earthy quality about her like a spring in the field or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his life the only times he knew it to be broken were at the agonized cry she gave at the telephone when Polly 's boy , Tod , was dead of diphtheria at eight and her shaken prayer aloud the night the parsonage was struck by lightning . Not that she lived without mysteries . They were only part of the familiar reality . One was her alien personalityp110in silk at church , sitting in the pew repeating religious forms that meant little to Johnny but which always brought from her lips the soft sibilants of reverence and belief . Anotherwas the deep sadness that came over her at times . When aware that it had been observed , she quickly threw it off . She would never explain or discuss it . There were also the incredible colors she told them she saw when she closed her eyes , colors unlike anything on earth . If only she knew how to paint them , she would make their fortune . His father was different , up and down , strong and positive , a phenomenon the boy continually resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how he struggled against it , never to be kept to the seclusion of fields and forests but always intent on towns and people . The boy felt uncommonly aware of this the day Maggie Moore called . Evans , her name was now , she said , but her man had died of a siege of intermittent fever . Papa made a great fuss over her . You might have thought this strange woman his long lost younger sister . When he asked after her mother and her family , it was as if after his own . " This is Maggie , your old nurse girl , Johnny , " he beamed at the boy . " You were only a baby and Maggie was , let 's see , just fourteen or fifteen years old . " " Thirteen , " Maggie said . " We were talking about it last week when we heard you 'd been up to Mike Barrett 's in Primrose . Mom thought maybe I could live out ' with you again . She said I know a little more now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm . This was the Lord 's doing , succor sent to Mamma by Heaven . But Mamma explained kindly and firmly to the girl . They had no store now to fall back on . They were just a poor preach-. er 's family , and a maid or even another mouth to feed was beyond their slender affording . Papa looked frustrated and Maggie took out her disappointment on Johnny , stroking the embarrassed boy 's arm , reciting how as a babe he used to wet himself at all hours of the night and scream to get her up and attend him . The more she went on , the grosser the injustice seemed to this thwarted woman to deny her the small work she craved . But Mamma held her quiet ground . The boys were no longer babies and she could manage . " Could I take him up to Lost Run then for a few days , ma'am ? " Maggie begged . " I 'd like to show him to Mom and the rest . They 've heard tell of him and never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamma would come to his rescue , and she did , but this time Papa would not back down . There were lost Lutherans at Lost Run he had long been wanting to hunt up . Maggie must stay for dinner . Then he would go along up on the mountain with her and Johnny on the afternoon miners ' train , stay at her mother 's house overnight and bring Johnny home tomorrow evening . The miners ' train was dirty and bare to the boy 's eyes . Three hard narrow benches ran the length of the car . Papa seated himself on one as on a throne . While the trainp112climbed the mountain he expanded to Johnny on Lost Run and the woman at whose house they were going to be guests . He knew no more saintly person in the patch , he told the boy , a Lutheran whose Irish husband had been killed underground leaving her to raise a big family . She had help from nobody but had found time to help others , generously baking for a funeral or wedding . She still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick or hanging paperfor somebody . Papa nodded . Should a baby be due in the patch , he told Johnny , they got Mrs. Moore instead of the Mahanoy doctor and when the doctor came to the patch to cut out tonsils or amputate an arm or leg , she was the one who stood by him and lent a hand with the bloody work . Johnny did n't know as he liked the prospect of staying at the house of someone so ready to cut off legs and tonsils . The unmistakable reek of anthracite in the car faintly nauseated him . At Lost Run when the miners came swarmingon the train before it stopped , he seemed in some foreignworld peopled by black-faced natives who brought fresh and stronger reminders of the deep Cimmerian veins . His father plainly reveled in it , piercing the black disguisesto call most of the miners by name and then to stride with greetings from all sides to an unpainted Company house which he entered like a lion . " And who is this ? " the big stout woman he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my oldest , " Papa declared . " The one that Maggiep113had to change so much . " He laughed heartily while the boy flinched . " Well , Reverend , " the large woman said placidly , " he looks like he 's big enough to go to the outhouse himself now . I hope he 'll take after you and his grandpop and make anotherpreacher in the family . " With indefinable gloom the boy heard the last train leave for Mahanoy that evening . The night that followed was a fantastic one in this strange house on Broad Mountain . At home he slept at ease in the back bedroom with Timmy and Gene . Up here he lay among the whole unfamiliar Moore clan , both women and men , all sleeping in the unpartitioned half-story attic they called " upstairs . " Walls had been left unfinished as was the ceiling . Board shelves nailed between the rafters held food and toilet articles . Slab bacon , shirts , petticoats , underwear and a half-used ham hung from nails . The tin of a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most remarkable place to sleep the boy had ever known , but his father took it as if going to bed in public was his accustomed wont , undressing in the darkness with the others around him , kneeling clown by the larger of the beds with legs  --  some were only ticks on the floor  --  taking a long time with his prayer , a silent one except for the audible sighs and occasional impassioned whispers interjected , it seemed to the boy , to give it more of a semblance of holy petition and devotion in this unseemly place . Then he laid himself down beside Johnny and recalled in a voice forp114the benefit of all the last time he had slept in the patch and what a sight like Pentecost it had been early next morning with the street filled with miner 's lamps , the tongues of flame bobbing and flaring in the darkness , the men singing on their way to Primrose and North Summit collieries and to No. 2 at Lost Run . Some had come from far down the mountain , tramping to save miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cold and darkness of an early winter morning could be so preposterously cheerful on his way to work and danger in the mines . In the morning when he awoke all the beds were empty save his . He dressed and went downstairs to find them at breakfast . Mrs. Moore stood huge and commanding by the stove . Something smelled good . " Now , Johnny , " his father said , " I 'm glad you 're along to see some of the womanly Christianity I told you about . The people next door have n't been the best of neighbors to the Moores . They think sometimes they 've missed milk from their cow and cabbage from their garden  --  " " We do n't think so , Reverend , " Maggie interrupted . " We know them devils done it . " " Now that 's enough of that kind of talk , " her mother called . " Forgive and forget , Maggie , " Papa said . " What I was about to explain to Johnny was that death came to this questionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ready to help what she can and bake a custard to take over . " Johnny felt let down . He thought the good smell meant something for their own breakfast . " Mom can take it over , Reverend , " Maggie said significantly , " but she ca n't make them let her in . " " Oh , yes , I can , " her mother put in piously . " I tell you I did n't try to keep anybody out the time your father lay a corpse in this house . I was glad enough for anybody to come around and give me a hand , let alone a custard . " " I think , Mrs. Moore , " Papa said , " I ought to go along and offer a prayer . Johnny , you may come , too . " The boy would have given much to escape but there was no eluding his father . They were both a step behind Mrs. Moore as she marched up to the back-porch steps next door . An Irish woman with wild-looking hair narrowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Moore said in her most polite tones . " It 's a sad day for you , we hear , and I thought I 'd come over and tell you how we felt for you . " There was no answer from Mrs. Shott , whose eyes were fixed on the custard . Neither did she open the door any wider . Maggie 's mother went on . " It happens that a preacher of the Gospel has been stayingat our house . You 've heard of the Reverend here from Mahanoy . He 's the same Harry Donner who used to comep116up from his store in Unionville , and his wife 's the daughter of the Reverend Morgan who baptized so many on Broad Mountain . The Reverend thought he should stop in for a few minutes and pray for the dead if you wanted him to . " The door opened an inch or two wider . " I do n't know , " the woman mumbled . " She was Catholic . " " That 's all right , Mrs. Shott , " Johnny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a Lutheran out of any of you . I just thought I might offer a prayer and ask if there was anything I could do . After all , we and the Catholics are both Christians . We pray to the same God and hope to go to the same heaven . " " I do n't know about that , " Mrs. Shott said again , but she opened the door an inch or two still wider . " Also "  --  Mrs. Moore played her trump card  --  " I thought I 'd bake you a custard . I hope you like custards . " Mrs. Shott , who had n't taken her eyes off the custard , looked sharply at her neighbor now for malice . " Oh , I can eat anything , Sophy Moore , " she said , letting the door give away at last so Maggie 's mother , the custard , Harry Donner , Maggie and Johnny could pass into the kitchen , where a red-faced man sat by the table . " Good morning , Mr. Shott , " Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . He was just telling Mrs. Shotthe 'd be glad to go in and say a prayer for the poor soul . " " Hold on ! " Mr. Shott said . " He ca n't go in there , Mrs.p117Moore . Not where the old woman was lying and dying . The dirt and stink would knock you over like a feather . " Maggie 's mother stood there huge and mountainous , looking anything but like a feather . " Well , maybe me and Mrs. Shott better go in first and scrub up a little for the Reverend . " " Ali , did you hear that , Kitty ? It 's a nice neighborly thing to do , Mrs. Moore . But I could n't let you be imposed upon . Not without the protection of holy water . " He put a hand under the table and lifted up a gallon jug partly filled with wicked-looking amber liquid at the bottom of which lay the jagged crystals of rock candy together with a small rusty hinge and still rustier nails . Mrs. Moore turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead for twenty years , Ben Shott , them that died in bed and them that had to be brought up in pieces , and I 've never had to drink rusty nails yet . Now if you 'll give me a rag , a basin and tea kettle , Mrs. Shott , you and me can go in and do our duty . " Armed with the objects in question , she led the way firmly into the back room off the kitchen which some called " the summer kitchen . " The Shotts had used it as a bedroom . She was back in a few minutes to send Maggie for a scrub brush and bucket of hot water from home . Her face was kind of mottled red and green . " I told you , " Ben Shott said . " We 're all weak and sinfulp118and in need of purification . What do you say , Reverend ? " " There are occasions that a little alcohol may be prescribed , " Johnny 's father said . " Well , only a sip then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't touch it as a rule . " The hinge and rusty nails clicked and slid as he poured her three quarters of a tumbler , which she lifted and tasted , taking another taste or two till Maggie came with the bucket , when her mother disappeared into the room only to come out from time to time and fortify herself a little more , finally to take the glass in with her as Mrs. Shott had done before her . Johnny 's father had taken a chair and entered into conversation with the man of the house when voices began comingunder the door . One was plainly that of Mrs. Shott but the other sounded as from a strange woman . " My lights and livers ! " it called . " How in the name of God , Mrs. Shott , did you let it get so rotten filthy in here ? " " I had nothing to do with it , Sophy Moore , " Mrs. Shott said . " You tend to your business and I 'll tend to mine . " " Do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman lying bedfast in a bed she could n't get out of when all the while you were here healthy and able with sound legs and arms in the same house ? " " I was busy feeding and taking care of her , Sophy Moore , and feeding and taking care of my man and seeing he got to work every morning to bring a dollar or two inp119the house so we could keep on feeding and taking care of this dirty old woman . " " You have the cruelty to call her a dirty old woman , your poor aunty lying here with her mouth shut and at peace after all the mean things she said in her lifetime ? " " Maybe she did , but that has nothing to do with me . " " Nothing to you ? You 'd deny you take after her , Myra Shott ! " " I 'd deny it if you said it , Sophy Moore , and anything else you said . " " Come over here , Mrs. Shott , " Mrs. Moore coaxed . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not it 's your own flesh and blood that could never tell the fair , decentand unpolluted truth ! " " Are you insinuating now and accusing me of prevaricationand foul language , Sophy Moore ? " " I 'm not insinuating and accusing you of anything , Myra Shott . I just want you to cast your eyes like you might at a sow in the pigpen and tell me if that was n't the way your mouth turned down the time Mr. Shott was hauled off to jail for beating to death with a sprag one of the mules on the eighth level of North Summit . " " That 's a dirty and dastardly lie , Sophy Moore . They never could prove that Ben even touched the mule . " " I did n't say there was anybody there to prove it on him in court . I only say if you come over here and look at the corpse from where I 'm standing  --  "  | " I do n't need to come over there , Sophy Moore . I 've been looking at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't take after the Tobins but the Mac-Sweens . " " So you take after the MacSweens ? " the other voice said with dangerous sweetness . " Maybe you could tell me about Paddy MacSween who kept a woman at the other end of Broad Mountain ? " " I can not ! " Mrs. Shott shouted along with a sound like the spatter of water hitting the ceiling . " Then can you tell me of Leo MacSween who they wanted to hang as one of the Mollies the time they shot poor old Mr. Raddabaugh at Primrose and stuck their fingers in his blood and wrote threats and warnings on the walls against anybody and everybody who did n't fall in with what they wanted ? " " That 's enough , Sophy Moore ! " Mrs. Shott warned . " I did n't ask you over to blacken and besmirch my uncle , God rest his soul ! " " No ! " Mrs. Moore said loudly and unsympathetically . " And you did n't ask if you could milk the cow either . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mrs. Shott answered with great loftiness . " It 's our cow I 'm talking about , Mrs. Shott . Up in the mountain you milked her when you thought nobody could see you . We did n't see you either . But we seen the custards you made . You even had the gall to set them to cool on thep121window sill on our side so we could stew in our own milk custards . " " It was never your milk in them custards , Sophy Moore . " " Then whose was it , I 'd like to ask ? " " It was nobody 's milk , Sophy Moore . Them was water custards . " " Water now , was it ? " Mrs. Moore 's voice was so high and sarcastic it sounded like a child 's . " I 'd like the receipt for water custards you can make rich as butter and yellow as a orange . " " Well , do n't worry . I 'll give it to you sometime . But do n't expect a sloppy Dutch cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yai , yai ! " Mrs. Moore moaned . " Now I 'm a sloppy Dutch cook and the one that tells me keeps no garden in summer and smokes no ham and bacon in winter but has to eat bread and molasses when the mines shut down . " " Sure we eat bread and molasses and we like it , " Mrs. Shott shouted . " We talk the king 's English , too , and not the pig language . " " What kind of English is that ? " Mrs. Moore cried . " Why did n't you talk it in Ireland then instead of having to wear shamrocks on monkey-hunting days so the English did n't shoot you by mistake ? " So it went minute after minute while things banged against the floor and walls and water slopped so that it finally flowed in rivulets under the door . Now how could his father , Johnny wondered , sit there all this time so natu/ral and unaffected , talking to Mr. Shott about people of the patch , bringing out a dozen names or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could his father , once it was all over and the door opened and a bleary , disheveled Mrs. Moore looked out startled to see the preacher as if she had forgotten all about him  --  how could his father go to the door of the room in sight of the awful object on the bed , and how could he stand there and pray in such a strong , fearless voice as if untouched by all the taint and smell of death and dissolution ? How especially could he speak to God so kindly of these terrible people and ask tender loving blessings upon them , both the quick and the dead , so that when he had finished , the boy found to his astonishment water cropping from the eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Shott and Maggie 's mother ? The latter spoke little or nothing until they went back to the house . " The Lord strike me dead , Reverend , " she said , " if you ever catch me like this again . When you come to preach my funeral sermon , I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p123Halfway  up the path to the mine superintendent 's house , the preacher halted . He wanted to catch his breath . He would stand here a little while and look down on Lost Run . In Mahanoy he knew some murmured against him . They said he was neglecting his church . Mr. Rennsler had brought it up at council meeting . " I preach two sermons for you on Sunday , " Harry Donnerhad replied . " I hold catechetical classes and Wednesdayeveningprayer meeting . I try to call on every parishioner twice a year . The sick and afflicted more often . " " But lots of times you 're not here , " Mr. Rennsler said . " When we send for you , we find you 're up in one of the patches on Broad Mountain that pay nothing toward your salary . " " They have no money , " Harry Donner explained . " And no church . What do I say when they come to me for help ? Do I tell them I 'm too busy for God 's work  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm his shepherd and they 're his sheep , too . " Looking down now on one of these same Broad Mountain patches , he felt glad for what he had said . The late-afternoonsun shone on Company house roofs . The winds at this elevation had fallen . Leaves scarcely stirred on the trees and the birds in the surrounding forest were silent . For an hour or so now time would seem to stand still up here as if in the presence of the Almighty . The slow , steady light , the clear mountain air and calm , he felt , marked that nearness . The culm banks glittered with a thousand tiny facets and even the ugly black breaker looked almost beautiful . Distant cries rose from barefoot children at play . The lazy sound of cowbells drifted from mountain pastures . Down near the slope he could see a dark object moving . He recognized the black wagon and white horses . It was the ambulance , of all things on wheels what mining folks hated most to see . As the word ran through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be standing at doors and gates , still as death , waiting to find at whose house , perhapstheir own , the wagon would stop . More than one injuredminer , Harry Donner heard , had climbed out short of home and made the rest of the way on foot . Better for his family to see him crawling into the house than the shock of the black wagon at their door . But the white horses now had left the patch and were on the road to South Summit . Preacher Donner closed his eyes to say a prayer for thep125unknown man in the black wagon . When he opened them again , a cloud had come over the face of the sun , and shadows lay on patch and colliery as if God had summarily departed , taking with him the inexplicable source of peace and repose . The children 's cries , which had ceased for a time , grew harsher while a string of oaths rose from Isaac Gottschall 's back door . None could swear with such frighteningviolence as the Pennsylvania Dutch , the preacher reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of some of the fierce-sounding German words . It was a hard place , he thought , to live and work and try to raise a family , close by the black slope that led to so much sorrow and disaster . Most patch people here he had known before he took holy orders . He could see Lizzie Yoh 's house now , near the prop and lagging piles . Her first husband had been squeezed to death between a mine car and gangway timber , her second badly burned in a fire damp explosion so that he was afraid of fire ever after and would let no matches in the house . Close by were the Housers , two of whose boys had been lost in the mines , one up Gilbertonway . Behind them on the next street Pete Shaw still lived though his back had been broken by a fall of rock eight or ten years ago . Not that misery , sadness and gloom were the temper of the patch . Far from it . There was the Irish wife of Al Madenford , who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on whiskey , cock fights andp126shooting matches at a couple hundred dollars a side . She seldom had a dollar to spend herself but she could still tell her thanks to the unknown railroad conductor who , when she was a slip of a girl coming from Canada on the Immigration , had touched her on the shoulder and told her to look out the other side of the train , and if she had n't , she 'd have missed seeing Niagara Falls . Another cheerful one was Pete Malarky , who always could make you smile like the time he was drawn for jury duty and came home saying , " What do you think they 've thought up in Pottsville now , boys ? Screening the air . I seen it myself , in the hotel window . " Next door Henner Kline would tell you about his mine mule , Topsy , who liked tobacco and followed him around like a dog . Nobody else could get any work out of her . Farther down the street , Solly Moyer , the fire boss , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He claimed they were an intelligent and sociable race , that the same rat waited for him at the same place underground every morning to run along and help inspect the inky breasts and headings to make sure they were safe for the men to follow . And Yuny Kestler usually had something new and acrimoniousto say about Bat McGurl . Both were watchmen at the crossing , one by day , one by night . Two years before they had quarreled . That night Bat took home the watchbox stovepipe he had put up himself and Yuny had to go out and get his own . And now just for spite each went to the trouble of taking down his own stovepipe at the end of hisp127trick and carrying it home to bring back and set it up next day while the stove smoked and sulphured . Harry Donner liked to chat with one or the other at the crossing , and if he could help it , he never missed seeing the Conleys to visit with their boy , fair as a girl with a whole gamut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles of secret joy and amusement that would break a weaker man 's heart . He was fond , too , of the Eckerts and their eight girls , all musical , who took turns singing to lighten the work of those doing the dishes , especiallywashing the hated dinner cans and bottles with chains that dirtied young girls ' hands . Harry Donner liked patch people . The worst miner he knew seldom failed to let something in his dinner can to bring home " for the kids to fight over " if only a lard sandwichwith black finger marks . And the best miner seldom bought his coal . The women and children loaded it on a hand wagon or wheelbarrow and then hid it in the bushes so the men could fetch it to the house after dark . " Taking coal from the Company is n't stealing , " they argued with the preacher . " The Company has more coal than it can sell . That 's why the collieries have to shut down in the summertime . The coal we take keeps them running a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little like children , poor lost children , the preacher thought . It 's what kept them happy through dark days , hard times and bare tables . Theirp128greatest deprivation , he felt , was something else . Standing here on the path to the superintendent 's house , he reflected on its nature , a house that was no Company house but a dwelling for the Lord . It need n't be large and of stone like at Mahanoy . Small and frame would be holy enough . The idea had possessed him since his first visit with Mike Barrettat Primrose . Lost Run was the better site with North and South Summit and Primrose and other patches in walkingdistance . He had even collected money for his dream , a quarter here and a half dollar there , mostly from the patches themselves . Catholics helped . Wiley Drumm , the engineer , gave him a dollar several times but most came from those who had very little . The money , a hundred and thirtyfivedollars , lay in a special account in the Mahanoy Miners Bank . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it now down there where those young pines grew , a tabernaclepainted white among the coal banks and unpainted Company houses , a symbol of purity in all this black wildernessof sin against earth and man . But it was n't the Lord 's house , rather another that troubled him today , the house of Isaac Gottschall , the man he had just heard cursing . His first arm lost in the breaker when a boy , he had gone inside , become a miner , and few were the men with two arms , it was said , who could dig and load more coal in a day than Isaac Gottschall with one . Then in March his second arm was crushed under a fall of rock and last week final notice had come to get out of hisp129Company house so a productive miner and his family could move in . " There 's nothing I can do , Reverend , " Tom Hughes , insideboss , had told him . " The order 's from higher up . If he 'd lost a leg this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peg and keep on working . But what can an armless man do around a mine ? And he ca n't stay in a Company house without working . " Harry Donner looked up now at the superintendent 's house . It had been built on a flat bench of the mountain to the specifications , they said , of a mine operator 's house in Wales , three stories of solid stone , with long stone-sill windowson two floors and dormers on the third . A veranda ran across the front of the house with a bay window upstairs and down on the southeast corner . Lawn and a flower garden lay around it , a stone stable stood to the rear and a fenced-in vegetable garden was adjoining . The Company furnished everything together with a man to take care of it , but the superintendent 's wife had to pay her own hired girl . Since becoming an invalid , she had kept two . Few in the patch had seen the inside of the house but the story ran that a relative of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told Mrs. Grace afterward that it was true . " What 's true ? " Mrs. Grace had asked . " Why , the sleeping rooms , " the woman said . " I heard that they did n't smell , but I would n't believe it . " The preacher did n't know the hired girl who came top130the door . He greeted her heartily as any girl of the patch . She failed to ask him in , but left him to cool his heels while she went to give his name . He knew by her face when she returned that the name had meant little . She said he could come to " the library , " and he followed her into a great wide hall , then to a room lined with bookcases that reached to the high ceiling . A well-dressed man his own age leaned competently on a walnut desk as in an office . His black mustache was bruskly clipped . He looked solid and capable . At the sight of him sitting there upright and decent , the preacher had difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What can I do for you ? " he wanted to know . " I 'd like to talk to you a few minutes , " Harry Donner said , stammering a little . Why was it , he asked himself , that he felt inept and inadequate in a big house like this , strangely deprived of the power of the Spirit that was always with him in a miner 's house ? Could it be true , as Vallie 's father had once hinted , that the son of a section foreman on the railroad was out of place among men his father would have called " tony " and " high muckety mucks , " that he belonged among the common people , the humble and the poor ? The superintendent of the Lost Run mine , he grew aware , was watching him narrowly . " Are n't you the preacher who 's been collecting for a Dutch church in Lost Run ? "  | " I guess I am , " Harry Donner said . " Well , if you 've come to me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superintendent declared . " Your PennsylvaniaDutch have been giving us a great deal of trouble . They 're too independent , even insolent if I may say it . They 've been especially troublesome and uncooperative during strikes . I do n't think the Company would look with favor on a Dutch church on Company ground . " " I did n't mean to talk to you about a church today , " the preacher said , sobered . " I came to see you about the Gottschalls . " Almost at once something alive and powerful entered the superintendent 's face as though to say , So that 's it , well , we 'll see about it . " If it 's a Company matter , the place to take it up is the Company office . " He waited . " May I ask what you have to do with it ? " " The Gottschalls are Lutherans , " Harry Donner said , " and I 'm their pastor , or the only one they 've got . Mrs. Gottschall asked me to come up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had asked me a month or two before when he said he heard what they call the death tick . You know , the men think it 's Vince Madden 's watch . They never found the watch when Vince 's body was dug out . They believe it 's still in the mine and whoever hears it will be next . " " I 'm quite familiar with the story , " the superintendentp132said coolly . " It 's pure superstition . The sound , if it 's heard at all , is caused by borers in the timber . Or possibly by the roof settling down on the props . In that case it might precedea fall of rock but the sound has nothing to do with the man who hears it . " " He would have to be dangerously close , I think , " Harry Donner pointed out . " But whether it 's superstition or not , the miners believe it and Rachel Gottschall was frightened when she knew about it . She wanted me to persuade Isaac not to go back inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining , anything but work underground . I talked to him and he asked me what else he could do ? Where could a man with one arm and no schooling get a job ? All he knew was digging and loading coal . And how would his wife and children live if he gave up his job ? I could n't do anything with him . I told his wife I 'd pray for him . It seemed to make her feel better . " An ironical cast came over the superintendent 's face . " I understand the miners say your praying for him kept him from getting killed ? " The preacher resisted the temptation to belittle his own prayer or minimize the possible protection of the Almighty . " These things are in the hands of a greater and more mysterious power than you and I , Mr. Grace , " he said with dignity . " She sent for me again when Isaac would n't let the doctor take off his arm . I stayed with him all day . Whatp133A House for Isaac and Rachelwould I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' he said . It 's the only arm I got left . How would Rachel and theGod did and if they did n't take off his arm , the doctorssaid , he would die . I said , You know the gas bubbles you see coming up out of the water in the mines ? Well , those bubbles coming out of your arm are gas , too , from the gangrene . Do n't you want to live for Rachel and your children ? " No , ' he said , they 'd be better off if I 'm dead . ' It took me a long time to get the notion out of his head . Before he gave in , he asked if I 'd stand by them . I said I would . Now they 've managed to get along without wages so far . She and the young ones tramp all over Broad Mountainpicking huckleberries to sell . They sell the milk from their cow . I tried to keep my promise . When the cow was bitten by a rattlesnake , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better . I had a wedding in Mahanoy at the time but there I was in Lost Run holding the cow 's tail so it would n't swish in the veterinary 's face . Now I 'm trying to keep a roof over their heads . It 's the only roof they have . They 've got no other place to go . " The superintendent 's face had n't changed . " I can only follow Company rules and practice , " he said . " We 're not unphilanthropic with our men . We take care of them as long as feasible . We 've never yet laid a man off for age so long as he could work . We even create jobs like watchmen at crossings so faithful old men can keep workingp134at something . Gottschall was right when he said there 's nothing in the mines that a man without arms can do . Besides , he 's a Dutchman and a stubborn fellow . They tell me he 's mighty short-tempered since his accident . If you ever heard him cursing , Reverend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping him . " " I heard him today , " Harry Donner said . " I do n't like his taking God 's name in vain any more than you . But the Bible says there 's more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repents than over a hundred righteous men . A man who curses like that needs help more than one who does n't . " " That sounds like strange theology to me . " The superintendentshook his head . " But even if I agreed with you , I could do nothing about it . It 's a Company ruling . The Companyca n't afford to let its houses to men who do n't work for the Company . " The man 's face and words were final enough but the preacher did n't quit . He told the superintendent he could n't see himself returning to an armless man with such a verdict . He reminded him of his duty to man , of his own physical wholeness , good fortune and mercy at the hands of God . He persisted and badgered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! " he shouted . " I do n't want to be rude to a clergymanbut if you keep on I 'll have to ask you to leave the premises . " Harry Donner gave up then . He had prayed for thep135success of the meeting . Throughout the interview while his tongue spoke as it could , his mind had begged for guidance , for words to say and for the feeling of love for this man that might beget its kind . But , he judged , the Lord must have further hardship and destiny for the Gottschalls . Then he looked up and saw the superintendent 's wife in the doorway . She was an emaciated woman with the fever spots that bespoke her fate . " Will ! " she pleaded and Harry Donner did n't see how the man could refuse her with her children around her , the youngest a boy of three or four . " This man Gottschall is a troublemaker like all his kind , " he told her . " If I break the rules for him , others 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lazy and jobless . Besides , how would a cripple like Gottschall be able to pay rent and how , if he does n't work for the Company , can we deduct it ? A man who is n't a Company man simply ca n't stay in one of our houses . Unless , of course , he happens to buy it . " " How can a man without work , Will , possibly buy a house ? " she asked . " I agree with you . He ca n't , " her husband declared . The preacher stood there uncomfortably . " How much would a house cost ? " " I do n't know definitely . I think we sold one a year or two ago at North Summit . If I remember rightly , the buyer paid three hundred cash . "  |p136The  woman in the doorway must have seen the preacher 's face . " You ca n't ask a man without arms such a sum , Will . " He turned angrily . " We 're not trying to get cash out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about such a transaction . The Company is reluctant to sell any part of its property . I only answered his question . The house in North Summit was Class B , if I remember rightly . Class C houses like the Gottschalls ' are listed at two hundred dollars . " " It 's sold ! " a voice said suddenly and the preacher felt startled , for the voice had been undeniably his own , yet he was aware of no such decision . " Very well , " the superintendent said , sitting down and turning back to his desk as if this were a small matter unworthyof much attention . " If you think there 's a chance these people can raise the money , I 'll hold the ouster until the end of the week . " Now that the deed was done , Harry Donner felt shaken and uncertain . He thanked him and turned to the wife to thank her and greet the children . " May I say a prayer before I go ? " he asked , and stood silent a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was their presence , he thought , that made his voice sound suddenly clear and strong as in other households . " We come before thee today , " he began , " to ask a blessing on this house and its people . Be thou with the manp137of the house , in whose charge thou hast given the lives and welfare of many human lives , who like the centurion of old sayeth to this one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh . Remember also the wife at his side . Strengthen and comfort her and let her return to the bloom of health so she may be a pillar of joy and refreshment to her husband . Bless also these children . Feed them so they may walk in the nurture and admonition of thy Word . We ask thy blessing , too , on what has taken place here today . May it redound to thy glory . We ask that thou continue to be with the family that only a short time ago had no place to lay its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and the dying to die and in the end save us . In Jesus ' name , Amen . " When he raised his head he found the wife looking at him with an indescribably piteous expression . " May I ask your name ? " she begged , and when he had told her , " I hope you will come again . " He said he surely would , shook hands with each , asked the names of the children and left . Down in the patch he stopped at the Gottschalls ' briefly , telling them not to worry , that he thought they could stay in the house . He would know more fully when he came Saturday . He had two more calls to make in Lost Run and it was late when he reached home . The boys were in bed but Mamma had waited up for him . " Is anything wrong , Hal ? " she asked  | " I do n't know , " he said unhappily . " I may have committedtransgression against God . I 've been worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , Hal ! " she said incredulously . He told her what had happened , that the money collected for God 's house he had pledged for a house for humans like himself . His wife looked relieved . " Let 's think you just borrowed it from the Lord , " she said . " I believe if you went to Unionville and explained it to a few men like Mr. Boyer , they 'd help you put the money back in the account . They helped you out when you needed it at Port Oxford . " " The trouble is , " he confessed , " I need two hundred dollarsand the money in the Lost Run church account is only a hundred and thirty-five . " He lay awake a long time that night pondering his dilemma . Mamma 's Scarlett cupboard had been cut down to get into the house here , so it was n't worth much . But her Scarlett sideboard would bring fifteen or twenty dollars . An antique dealer had offered as much . After all , it was intended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , it was mighty heavy and had been a nuisance to crate and move . Of course , he guessed it meant something to Mamma , especially its claw feet and tremendousmirror . But she would still have left the Scarlett cutglassdecanter , the Scarlett andirons and the cannonball that Pap-pa had picked up on the battlefield at Gettysburg.  |p139T  he black-coated figure tramped the mountain road betweenPrimrose and Lost Run . It was cold . His shoes were muddy . He should have put on his rubbers . His legs felt played out . But it was n't the weariness in the flesh that troubled him so much as the spirit . This was the first time he remembered dreading a visit to Lost Run . He would rather today have avoided sight of the ugly black breaker , the unpainted houses and the people . It had been three years since he started making the patches on Broad Mountain his missionary field , and he was no nearer a church in Lost Run than before . The chippers still had their Sunday barrel of beer and their ribald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church should stand . The Company continued to deny him the land . He had a growing conviction that he had failed both God and man . Even the most faithful of his people , the Moores and the Eckerts , looked at him with pity , he thought . Theyp140knew his God had not backed him against the coal company as he had Daniel against Nebuchadnezzar . Once Harry Donnerexpected that the Lord 's hand , which the Psalms declaredwas not shortened , would work in its mysterious way through the mine superintendent 's Lutheran wife . But when she died last year he had not been asked to conduct or even assist at the funeral . They had the Episcopalian ministerfrom Pottsville . Harry Donner kept going to see the children . After all , they were half Lutheran , and the mother 's religion commonly determined that of her children . He had planned to call on them in the big stone house today , although he noticed they were always strange with him when their father was at home . Here on the road he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of his ministry . His congregationat Mahanoy continued to grumble at the time he spent in the patches . Last June his oldest son had shamed him by saying he could n't speak at high school commencement . The school board had refused to let him graduate and the father had lost his temper with them before they gave the boy a diploma . And last Sunday his youngest son had given his mother a bad time in her pew during the sermon . He had ordered Tim up on one of the pulpit chairs behind him and when his congregation tittered , he looked around and found the lad making faces at the people . Why was it that a minister had to have the worst children in town ? It hurt to be let down by those you tried to do thep141most for . There was Isaac Gottschall , who seemed to welcomehim of late only as somebody to light his pipe . He had a little store now in the front room of his house , like Sally Barrett used to have before she remarried after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , owning their own house , with Isaac making a few dollars a week selling tobacco , candy , knickknacks and groceries including bread that came six days a week on the miners ' train . He could open the door with his foot , make change with his stump , set down his pipe on the counter 's edge by bending and picking it up in his teeth the same way . But he swore more than ever and complained bitterly that he had to have his wife or one of his boys go along to the outhouse with him to button and unbutton him . What sobered the preacher most tonight was the " taking down " Wiley Drumm , head mining engineer for the Markles , had given him . They had been walking together from Primrose to catch the late train down the mountain from Lost Run . There were just the two of them . Wiley was a consistently heavy drinker but Dan Markle said that as long as he could read a blueprint and run a line , he could keep his job at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lights of Lost Run through the tops of the trees that he had got on the subject . " You 're too damn good for this godforsaken country , Reverend . You ought to go to the city where there 's money and something going on . "  | " I ca n't be very good , Wiley , " Harry Donner said . " I 've never had a call to the city . You know in my line you 've got to wait till somebody asks you to preach a trial sermon . " " You can wait till the cows come home , Reverend . The church is no different from any other business . If you want it , you got to go after it . That brings me to something . Now mind , you brought this up yourself . You 're the one , not I , who said you 'd never had a call to the big city and never went after anything . But now that you 've said it , I 've got to agree . You 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll excuse me for saying such a thing to you . " " I have many faults , Wiley , " the preacher said . " No , not many , Reverend . That 's the trouble . But it 's enough . It 's your mortal sin . It 's what holds you back with God and man . Do you know Francis Thompson 's poem : I fled him down the nights and down the days ; I fled him down the arches of the years ' ? Well , you do n't flee him . He does n't need to follow you . He does n't need to beg you to go his way . He does n't need to cross your palm with gold and silver . He can let you starve and do without . He knows you 'll stay with him just the same no matter what . Do you follow me , Reverend ? " " No , not yet , " Harry Donner said doubtfully . " Well , can you get it better if I put it another way ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for your own good . Now I do n't mean goody-good . You 're not that . I do n't mean pious and mealy-mouthed . I do n't know ex/actly what I do mean except that you do n't look after yourselflike the rest of us . When commonsense was handed around , you were left out . If a man asks you for a dollar , you 're liable to give him two . If he asks you to listen to his tale of woe , you pray and go to bat for him to boot . You were the same way when you kept store in Unionville . That 's how you lost out , giving credit to all these lousy miners who never paid you . I bet you have n't got a dollar on those back debts since you 're here though they see you walking around with your elbows sticking out and your sole leather worn through . " " They have a hard time getting along themselves , Wiley , " the preacher pointed out . The engineer laughed . " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you the first time I met you , and if I 'd missed it then , I 'd have known it the minute you opened your mouth . You never changed a hair when you got close enough to smell my breath and found I had a drop or two . You did n't lecture me . You did n't try to save me . You did n't try to chalk up my soul as a mark on your account in heaven . If I wanted to go to hell , that was my business , but you 'd say a prayer so I 'd slide down a little slower and hell fire would be a little cooler . When I bragged , you did n't try to show me you were as smart and important as me . That 's the trouble with this damn goodness . It does n't get any better or learn anything . It 's satisfied with itself and other people as theyp144are . It 's satisfied living in a black hole like this just so it can look after other people in this black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's you , Reverend , and that 's the main trouble with you . Do you know something else , Reverend ? " " I guess I know very little , Wiley , " Harry Donner said sadly . " Well , just let me tell you this . Goodness never gets you anywhere , not even with the Lord . Or with yourself . It does n't drive you . It does n't keep you awake at night scheminghow to get back at somebody who did you dirt or how to beat him out of an honest dollar . A good person gives too much time to people who ca n't help him . The smart one plays up to the right people . Take Andy Christenson down here in Lost Run . Most everybody likes him and he likes everybody . He 'll do most anything for you but what will it ever get him ? He 'll be station agent in this hole the rest of his life . On the other hand , take Mel Dicer . Nobody liked him much when he was at Mahanoy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless for a reason . But he knew the right things to do for the right people . Now he 's superintendent of the Reading division . They call him a leader . He never gives you his time unless Mel Dicer wants something . He sees you with that in mind . He watches you like a cat . Everything he says and does is to soften you up and get you around to his way of thinking . But what do you do ? You give every Tom , Dick and Harry your time just because you like him . You baptize him , confirm him , marryp145and bury him and all his kin . You visit with him and get down on your knees for him and , if you can get away with it , sing for him . You just like to sing . You do n't need to be coaxed . You went to bat for that armless Gottschall and got him a house and what did it get you ? Poor devils like him and the miners you kept eating during the strike ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , and you crossed him up by implying he was doing a dirty thing putting a man without arms out of his house . Sometimes I think what griped him most was making him sell you a house for one of his own men . Now I hear he has no use for you , wo n't give you a couple square feet of his stinking black ground to build a ten-by-four church and graveyard . He hates your guts . I 'd say it 's a kind of honor to be hated by him , Reverend . If I 'd had as good a wife as he had , I 'd sooner be lying dead drunk in the gutter than run around with all the women he did while she was alive . And he 's still doing it now that she 's dead . Lately I hear he 's been laying out with that hellcat of a Minersville woman . " " I 'm sorry to hear it , " Harry Donner said with feeling . " I 'm sorry , too , " Wiley Drumm said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not God , Reverend , I do n't want you different . I like you pretty much as you are . I hope I have n't made you feel bad . I always talk too much this time of day . " Harry Donner did n't say so but he wished the engineer had n't mentioned that last thing about Will Grace . Therep146were plenty of unpleasant things he could tell , too , if he wanted , accounts of sin , disease and death in the patches around him . Now why did the flesh itch to hear and repeat all the bad things of the flesh ? Only the spirit seemed to welcome things of the spirit . What was that which Jude had said ? " He is of purer eyes than to behold evil . " He felt bad enough for the mine superintendent and sorrier for his children . He had wanted to see them today but not with Wiley Drumm 's picture of their father soiling his mind . It was hard enough to visualize and believe in Will Grace as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brother . Well , he would visit ailing George Akers first . Then perhapshe could still call at the big stone house on the hill and be gone or at least his mission half done before the superintendent came home from the office . The call took longer at the Akerses than he had thought . It was always hard to get away from these nice people . On leaving , the poor Conley boy saw him four or five houses away and called in his high eager , wordless , almost birdlike voice . The afternoon was more than half spent , but Harry Donner could n't resist going in to see him for a while . The boy made such a fuss when he called . Sometimes he thought he almost understood his gibberish and sometimes that the boy understood him , but what each understood , he guessed , were the smiles , the tone of their voices and the fellowship between them . He had heard at the Akerses that Meg Madden was " inp147bad shape " and now as he passed , Mrs. Bogle next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She heard you were in the patch and wants to see you . " " Is n't Old France at home ? " " She was better at noon and he went to work . " Harry Donner passed in the gate with Mrs. Bogle behind him . He had known Meg Madden from his store days , a big Irish woman old enough to be the mother of most everyone in the patch , once a veritable mountain of life , gossip and sly humor but of late an incredible little old woman so ancient they called her lad Old France to tell him from his married son of the same name . There was almost nothing recognizable in the face on the bolster when he came into the front room downstairs . It was a sagging muscleless face , the white hair an anachronism , as if belonging to some other day and time . " The Virgin fetched you to the patch today , Father , " she greeted him , clutching his hand with a frightening grip . " It 's all right , Granny . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to calm her while she held to him like a drowning soul to a root . He offered a quiet prayer but her grip refused to loosen until toward the end when her fingers gradually weakened and her eyes lost some of the wild look . " Shall I ask Andy Christenson to phone for Dr. Fegley for you ? " he asked . She shook her head and he went on.  | " Is there anybody or anything you want ? " " My confession , " she begged . " You could hear it and give me absolution ? " He looked troubled . " I 'm not your father-confessor , Mrs. Madden , " he pointed out . " You know but have probably forgotten that I 'm Protestant . But I can stop and see Father Keleher for you when I get back to Mahanoy . " " He 'd never get here in time , " she said . " Besides , I know you a lot longer than him . You would n't deny the last requestof a dying old woman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would an old woman of nearly ninety have to confess ? " Her eyes stared blackly , enigmatically at him and he had the first faint premonition of what was to come . He paged through his Ministerial Acts with helpless fingers . There was , he remembered vaguely , a form for private confession . He had never been called on to use it before . He felt her watching him anxiously . He would have to go through this with fitness and decency . " In the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost , " he began in a strong , resolute voice . " Get her out first , Father , " the dying woman hissed . He turned and saw Mrs. Bogle standing piously behind him , intent on everything that went on . She left with reluctanceand he closed the door before returning to his small black book.  | " Make haste , O God , to deliver me ! " he continued . " Have mercy upon me according to thy loving kindness . Accordingunto the multitude of thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me . Thou desirest truth in the inwardparts . And in the hidden parts thou shalt make me to know wisdom . Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean . Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow . Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities  --  " He grew aware that she was making violent hissing noises . " Not yet , Father , " she protested hoarsely . " I must talk first . " Examining the fine print at the head of the order , he found that she was right and the confession came earlier . " You may say it in your own words , Granny , " he said kindly . " Or you can use the general order of confession that I can read to you . " " I want to say it myself , Father . That 's the way I was used to . But you better sit down like the other fathers do . " Afterward he thought he knew why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence came their fortitudeto take it and whence the sudden vitality that rose in the dying woman now that she was engaged in baring her soul ? Her admissions came in a growing stream , mostly carnality in thought , word and deed but principally in thought that filled him with shock and incredulity . He didn'tp150know that such conceptions existed in the world . At length she fell back spent and exhausted but not before his eyes and ears had defensively dulled against the spectacle of this toothless old woman before him pouring out thoughts and things some of which he had never heard of before and which he hoped he never would again . In his confusion it took time to find his place in his little book . He wondered if his own church authorities had had the experience and knowledge to deal with such extraordinarymatters . Then he found and declared in a loud ringing voice what he was not sure at the moment he wholly and completely believed . " Almighty God , our Heavenly Father , hath had mercy upon thee , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesus Christ , our Lord , forgiveth thee of all thy sins . Upon the confession which thou hast made and in obedience to our Lord 's command , I declare unto thee the entire forgiveness of all thy sins , in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost . " He added a short prayer the words of which he could not remember clearly afterward , gave her what comforting words he could muster , bade her good-by and called Mrs. Bogle . He had to make another call , he said , and must get back to Mahanoy before dark . The air outside had seldom felt so fresh and clean as when he emerged today but he made no immediate attempt to visit the house of the superintendent . He had small rel/ish to see the children with this additional foulness upon him . His respect grew for priests he knew who must listen year in and year out to such defilement . They could give cleansingabsolution to those confessing but who would give cleansing absolution to them , the hearers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian desert such as the Lord sought in trouble but there was wildernessenough and a mountain to go up in to pray . Perhaps they would do , he thought , and his feet found a path . In the woods boys called to him to watch out for air holes . He felt thankful they had been here . He had been going almost blindly along the mountain when this black break in the earth opened almost under his feet . The boys said there was still a bigger hole farther on . Neither one had bottom , they said . With the preacher as an audience , they proceeded to show off , carrying up rocks to throw in . He could hear them crashing down in the pit from pillar to post , giving up deep sinister rumblings as they went farther into the earth , the sounds growing fainter until at last they ceased altogether . Even then he imagined the doomed rocks still falling through impenetrable blackness too distant under his feet to be heard . The preacher stood there uncertain . There was something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriously troubled him , and yet as it continuedhe thought he felt relief as if each of the falling rocks carried with it some of his ugly burden into obscurity.  |p152When  the boys tired of their fun , he turned back to the patch and climbed the path to the big stone house . Their father was n't at home , the children told him . He had been away all last night . They seemed doubly glad for a caller this evening . As a rule when he called , the house seemed to have a faint reek of carbide from the lighting plant . Tonightthe odor was very strong , but he got used to it by the time the maid came in to light the parlor chandelier . Still the superintendent had n't returned . Wiley Drumm 's words came back to him , " He 's been layingout with that hellcat of a Minersville woman . " He threw himself into a livelier exchange with his young hosts , teasing and bantering , getting them to laugh , encouraging them to talk about themselves , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters . Men , he had noticed , were generally able to do more with girls than with boys . He did n't know why except that girls were quicker to respond , catch on and enliven , were more appreciative of a man and attention . He and Vallie had had all boys at home . He sometimes wished it had been otherwise . He suspected that the children turned back by the disciples from the Lord must have been girls . Not that he himself had trouble with boys except his own . Most boys seemed in his own words to " take a shine " to him . Before the evening was over he had the superintendent 's young son singing a song that his sisters said he knew , after which the preacher taught himp153another . The boy took to it quickly , perhaps because his own name was Jack . I 'm a jolly old quack , quack , quack , Who carries his pack on his back . I 've rhubarb and quills , Plasters and pills , And they call me Medicine Jack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the veranda and the front door opened . All was silent for a moment . Then with a strong oath the superintendentrushed in , threw the parlor windows wide , turned out the lights abruptly and left them in darkness . Presently they could hear him banging around in the cellar . Harry Donner felt discomfited . He waited a little before standing up , said he guessed he had to go . He made a brief parting prayer in the darkness , uncertain whether any of the children were left in the room to hear him . Afterward he said good-by and found his way to the door , grateful for the peace and starlight outside . All the long road down the mountain that night he pondered the happening , the strange behavior and the unhealable breach between him and the superintendent who went to such lengths to oppose and eject him . Monday he came back to Lost Run to find the incident thep156talk of the patch . They told him the superintendent had come home from Minersville to find the house filled with escaping gas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did n't you notice the carbide ? " they asked the preacher . " I could n't help but notice the smell , " Harry Donner admitted . " But I did n't know that I should do anything about it . " " He told the maid , " Mrs. Tom Hughes said , " that he could n't figure out how the house never blew up with the lights turned on full in the parlor and the gas thick enough to cut with a knife . He said there you all sat laughing and talking as though nothing was the matter . He said the only thing that saved his young ones was the presence of a good person in the house . " " Which person did he mean ? " Harry Donner asked , puzzled . " I 'm sure his maid is a good woman and I know all his children are . "  |p157I  t was a sunny afternoon in spring , and the preacher was driving home from one of the three churches of his new charge . He told himself again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley , that the Lord must have laid it out in person , this magnificent triangle of meadows and rolling farm land shut in by mountain walls on two sides and by the broad river on the other . For six years he had been in the raw Mahanoy region , among mountainsgashed and plundered for coal . Summer and winter he had tramped the black roads of Broad Mountain . Now he labored in what he liked to refer to in his sermons as " God 's green vineyard . " Sometimes he felt licentious and a little sinful to be carried over the roads here by his own horse and buggy . The Lord had surely been good to him , allowing him to build and dedicate his church at Lost Run before he left . It was not a big church but it had given him joy to see itsp158gold cross lifted over the patch , then to come upon it tidy and clean among the black dirt banks and unpainted Companyhouses , and finally to open the front door and glimpse the bright golden oak pews inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit hung the stainedglasswindow of the Good Shepherd holding the lost sheep in his arms . He hoped his part in it had not made him vain but there was something in him that always leaped at the sight of the white church standing where there had been none before , its doors open to all , a kind of symbol of the heart of God and also of one of his humble servants ready to be called on day or night , in sin or in trouble , in sickness or death . Vallie had wanted him to name it St. Mark's-of-theMines . He had thought that a little pretentious . After all , it was not a Catholic or Episcopal church but plain , very plain , Lutheran . Had this small church and its people been able to support his family , he might never have left . But the synod had kept it in the older , richer Mahanoy charge , and the council of the latter had objected . They pointed out that it was they who paid the minister 's salary yet most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . They had n't authorized him to build it in the first place , and the time spent on it and money collected might have been better used to enlarge and improve their own stone church building . After a year or two of reproach and widening rift in the Mahanoy congregation , the preacher had come to the con/clusion that a new pastor who had nothing to do with buildingthe Lost Run church might find less feeling against him and do more for the charge as a whole . When the call came to Wetherill Valley , he had regretfully accepted and left . Not without misgivings , he admitted to himself . How did you ever really know the call of the Lord from that of your own restless heart ? He told Mamma he hoped he had n't jumped from the frying pan into the fire , for he had found a rift in one of the Wetherill Valley congregations wider than that which he had just left . The Piatts wanted a new , imposing , brick church on their hill . The others felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone hard to persuade them to get together and compromise . With the help of the Lord the job had been done and all seemed milk and honey between them now . As he drove along the ridge road the preacher could see the prosperous places of the Piatt supporters on his left toward Nippenose Mountain ; first the white buildings of George Piatt , who with the help of his wife and daughter ran the valley telephone exchange in the back of his Sugar Hill store ; the large red barn of Ray Piatt , who had a prosperous milk route in town ; and the yellow barn of Quincy Piatt , who owned the first and only automobile in the valley . " Quincy 's machine , " they called it , and when the mud or snow permitted , he brought his family in it to church . The only Piatt place you could n't see from here was Oliver 's , who had a brick house and stone barn on the Longp160Run road . His was said to be the best farm in the valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this end of the valley and sent his only girl to study music in Boston . " The Piatts , " Jenny Rodey told the preacher , " have big ideas . They think themselves more than common people . They got to live up to their brother Morris , who has the iron works in Hancock . " On the other side of the ridge road as he drove , Harry Donner could see the farms and roofs of the Rodey supporters : the faded green house of tough old Cap Waltman , who smoked a pipe in his barn and hay mow ; the log house of Gus Sheffer , who prayed in a deep quivering , unintelligiblevoice that almost put the preacher 's boys in stitches ; the farm of his brother Cal Sheffer , whom Gene called **26;3506;TOOLONG because he always said " and now finally and eventually " in his prayers ; and the swamp farm of Dave Ney , who last winter had invited the preacher 's family to a squirrel and wild turkey dinner , and whom Harry Donner called " like Nimrod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there out of sight in the swamp lived Mrs. Kelso , famous as the cook who belittled her inimitable pies , bread or roast , complaining " It did n't get good today " or " It 's not fit for a hog to eat . " Still ahead was the blacksmith shop of Sammy Glass , who liked to call from his shop to his wife in the kitchen , " Kate ! Cook beans . Cook a whole potful . God , I like beans ! "  |p161And  now the preacher 's horse was climbing the easy grade to the Manada Hill church and the white house and unpainted barn of Phillip and Jenny Rodey , who lived close by . Vallie said she would n't want better neighbors . Harry Donner felt the same . Without Phillip to stand by him for fairness and reason in council meetings , he believed the rebellious ones would have bolted the Manada Hill church long ago . He told her more than once he would have to watch out that he did n't show favor to Phillip over the Piatts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road the new unfinished church itself , a series of low brick walls and high brick bell tower , all enveloped by skeleton work of two-by-fours and larger timbers to be faced later by brick . The old clapboard church adjoining had stood here for a hundred years , he had been told , and a log church before that . He unhitched Pompy and had come into the house when five short rings sounded from the yellow telephone box . " Hal-loa ! " he answered in rich greeting and testimony that God was in his heaven and all right with the world . " Reverend ! " It was Jenny 's stricken voice . " I just seen you come in . Could you come over ? " " Why , I guess so , Jenny , " he said with strong reassurancewhich after a moment or two , remembering her tone , he did not entirely feel . He looked thoughtfully at Mammap162as he hung up . " She seemed upset over something . " A few minutes later his black ministerial figure was crossing the road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he came back , Mamma met him at the door . Her face sobered at sight of his . " Phillip 's been arrested , " he said . " He 's had to give bail for a hearing . " " What in the world for ? " Mamma demanded . " For stealing a pig , " Harry Donner said , and when Mamma laughed , " It 's no laughing matter , I 'm afraid . " " But Phillip stealing a pig ! " she protested . " Everybody knows Phillip . He 's about the most honest and fair man in the valley . " The preacher looked grave . " Jenny and Phillip think it is n't the pig . It 's the church . " " What could the church have to do with it ? " " Well , they claim Estes Croy would never dare to have him arrested on his own . They say somebody must be behind him . They say when Estes needs money he borrows it from Oliver Piatt and then cuts timber for Oliver to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillip for voting down the Piatt plans for a big church . " " But that 's too outlandish . To go to court over a pig just because of the church . " " If the church had nothing to do with the pig before , I 'm afraid it 's going to now , " Papa said gravely . " Phillip is bitter . You know he and his group control council . Theyp163say they only agreed to go along on the new church for my sake . They still think the old church is good enough . They can stop the building any time they like , next Monday at council meeting if they want . Phillip said as much . Then we 'll have a stalled church and the fighting all over again . " " But Phillip always seemed so reasonable . " " You ca n't expect a person to be reasonable , Vallie , once he 's been arrested for stealing a pig . " " Oliver must know Estes never could win . " " I do n't know about that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , before we came , but it seems we 're mixed up in it . Jenny says Estes ' pigs used to push down the rail fence between their land and come over and eat up Phillip 's crops . Phillip would have to drive them back and fix the fence . This went on for a long time . At last Phillip told Estes he 'd keep one of the pigs for damages if Estes did n't put them some place else . Estes did n't do much about it and the next time they came through , Phillip kept one . Jenny said it was only a shote . You know how Phillip is , soft and quiet spoken till you tread on him too far , then nothing will change him . He says Estes would n't mend the fence , so he put the pig in his own pigpen . " " Where is it now ? " " Phillip says he kept and fed it till spring . Estes still would n't pay any damages so Phillip turned it loose in Estes ' winter wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheat what it had done to his own corn . Estes claims hep164never got his pig back , that Phillip and Jenny butchered it last winter . " " He ca n't prove such a thing , can he ? " " Maybe not . But a lot of people heard about it and came to see the pig in Phillip 's pigpen . Jenny says at the hearing Estes will have lots of witnesses . She says Oliver will throw the case into court . If that happens , she says it 's proof that Oliver is footing the bill because Estes would n't have the money or stomach to do it . The Piatts , she says , can then sit back and enjoy it and not have to mix in except what Oliver does legally as squire . Jenny says it 's not only to get back at Phillip but at me . " " You ? Why would he want to get back at you ? " " Well , we 're close neighbors here to Phillip and Jenny . In council , Phillip 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ideas across . Jenny asked if I 'd be a character witness for Phillip . I said of course I would . She warned me if it got to court and I testified for Phillip , Estes ' lawyer might try to make it look like we got some of the stolen meat . You know , they did give us a ham and slab of bacon last winter . " " This is ridiculous , " Mamma said indignantly . " Such a fuss over a pig could never get to court . " But as time went on in the triangle of Logan and Nippenosemountains , Mamma had to admit she had been wrong . For the good part of a year the matter of Phillip Rodey accused of stealing a pig was kept before the peoplep165of Hancock County and Wetherill Valley in particular , first in news and talk of the hearing , then the throwing of the case into court , the setting of a date for the trial , the announcement of several postponements , the summoning of witnesses , rumors of what one or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Wetherill Valley huckstersclosing their market stalls in Hancock as early as possible to spend the rest of the day in the crowded court . All through the clever testimony for the plaintiff , and the helplesscharacter witnesses for the defendant , and through the shocking verdict that Phillip Rodey was found guilty of willfully possessing and disposing in some unknown manner of a shote , the property of his neighbor ; and through the court sentence that Phillip pay a fine of forty dollars and close to a hundred in court costs while Estes was let go with instructions along with Phillip to keep the fences pigproof between them  --  all through this nightmare of defeat and refusal of Phillip Rodey to attend church services thereafter , the preacher had to swallow his feelings and follow the peaceful pursuit of his calling , visiting and praying for the sick and well , preaching the meek and humble doctrine of the Lamb to all who came to hear his sermons , including the Piatts , who never before , he thought , had sat so smug and righteous in their pews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuously empty , Jenny coming alone and white-faced with her two small boys . But if Phillip failed to attend church , he never failed top166attend council meeting . Despite the preacher 's pleas and protests , Phillip 's motions were made and carried to halt what he called the mounting burden of debt on the congregationand to spend no more on the new building until plans could be revised within the ability of the congregation to pay , which could mean only one thing . " I find it hard to pray for the Piatts , especially the one who brought this about in the first place , " Papa confessed to Mamma . " Although God knows that Phillip 's stubbornnessis a thorn in my side , too . " Everyone who passed now could see that construction on the half-finished church had stopped . Not a workman was left , and the Rodey men promised that 's the way it would stay . The stalemate went on , with Oliver , they said , cutting timber with his own hands to work out his frustration , and Phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing when he slipped from the windlass and fell to the bottom of the hole , breaking a leg , which swelled so badly by the time they got him out that the doctor had to cut off a shoe and sock . " Oh , Phillip 's feet ! " Jenny moaned . " He has n't washed them since Saturday . " In the excitement they forgot about Seranus Mast , who had gone down in the well to put the injured man in the bucket and had been left there . Phillip was just able to be around and start getting in his crops when he lost his footing again . This time he fellp167from the hay mow to the barn floor . When they picked him up and carried him to the house , he told them calmly he was hurt inside and would never be able to work again . " It 's this pig business , Reverend , " Jenny told the preacher bitterly . " Phillip never fell before in his life . It 's as if he wanted to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jenny , " he told her , but in the secret of his mind he kept wondering about it , for Phillip went from bad to worse . Dr. Gordiner called most every day from town and a pretty young nurse from Hancockcame to stay at Jenny 's house around the clock . It was pleasant enough to see her in white going about the yard followed by young single men from the valley who gave the excuse they had come to see Phillip or ask how he was . But it was not pleasant for the preacher to visit Phillip , to see him who had been so ruddy and strong when they first came to the valley now a pale shadow of himself in bed or to hear him say terrible things about himself in that calm confident way of his , that he 'd never get out of bed , that his bowels would never move again , and that he hoped the Reverend would look after Jenny and the boys when he was gone . They had brought his bed down to the parlor to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying with closed eyes beside the organ , with the stiff red plush parlor chairs around him , the sheaf of wheat on the wall and Jenny stand/ing grief-stricken at the kitchen door , the preacher felt it almost as if he had come to conduct funeral services over his friend and neighbor . " We 're not doing enough , " he told Jenny in the kitchen . " Phillip 's still fighting that pig case . Do n't say anything to him , but if I get the Piatts here to cut and shock his oats , I hope for his sake you 'll be nice to them and feed them . " " I 'll do what you say , Reverend , " Jenny said . " If I must let them skunks on our place , I must . " But when the preacher came over an evening or two later , he had to confess it had not gone as he had hoped . The Piatts , he said , had been nice enough . They had listenedgravely . They would like to have done what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notary work and a case coming up . Ray was delivering milk himself this week and had to go to bed early to get up at two in the morning . And Quincy had a felon on his hand . Then they all had oats of their own to cut . He added lamely that he had asked them to remember Phillip in their prayers . " I did n't say nothing , Reverend , but I could have told you how them Christians would act , " Jenny said bitterly . All that week the preacher felt out of favor with both God and man . What was it , he thought , that made quarrels between real brothers and between church brethren more implacable and irreconcilable than between unrelated rnen ? Whatever the cause , the phenomenon must have existed a long time , for far back before Christ , the Psalmist hadp169pleaded , " Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity . " Could it be that love between brothers was an illusion ? Or did love when turned to hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul had said , " Love suffereth long and is kind . " Could blood brothers and Christian brothers mistake pride in their relationship for love ? And pride was one of the seven deadly sins . It never forgave or forgot . " I ask , Lord , that I may never be proud , " Harry Donnerprayed in bed before getting up . That prayer seemed to stir something around him . For the first time in days he felt a response when he reached upward . It gave him new hope . He went to see Phillip twice that day . Seldom had he interceded for anyone as he did by Phillip 's bed that evening with Jenny and the nurse standing with bowed heads at the kitchen door and the little group of hangers-on , he knew , listening outside . He begged God to do something and not " stand afar off . " He told Mamma afterward he believed his supplication heard because the strong scent of honeysuckle , like balm from Gilead , came into the room from the porch as he prayed . But next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burn down the church . A hard electrical storm with heavy wind and little rain swept over Wetherill Valley beforemorning . The preacher thought the worst over and was going back to sleep when Mamma wakened him . He saw flickering light in the bedroom window and heard a longp170continuous ring of alarm on the telephone . He had no need to answer . He guessed what it meant . By the time he had pulled on his clothes and run out of the house , Jenny and the nurse and boys were helpless dancing puppets before the flames that licked the framework of the new sanctuary and Sunday-school room , from where they soon spread to the old adjoining church building , turning it into a huge box roaring with wind and fire in the black night . Pale and grim-faced men kept arriving , some on foot across the fields , some by road with horses . They tried to use buckets from Phillip 's and the parsonage wells but , as Jenny said , they might as well had spoons . The heat , the roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster drove everyone back . In the end all that remained was the blackenedruin of foundations and brick bell tower standing stark in the dawn among the scorched and blistered trees of the church grove . " We was like ants trying to stop a flood , " Dave Ney said . That day and the rest of the week the preacher found himself unfit for his duties . He could only stand around condoling with men and women who kept getting out of vehiclesto gaze at the smoking ashes and blackened bell tower like a wrecked idol to Baal where for more than a hundred years a Christian house of God had stood on Manada Hill blessing the landscape and all who passed . But through the repeated worn phrases of commiseration to others he kept asking one question in his heart . If because of man 's quar/reling over his new temple , God had chosen to destroy it , why did he consume the faithful old church as well ? Now his people were sheep scattered by the winds , with no fold in which to gather for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , he wondered if he himself had not unknowingly been the sinner . It came , of all people , from one of his own men , big , bluff , tactless Seranus Mast , who had once told the visiting Jess when he helped her out of the buggy that she was the lamest woman he ever saw . " Well , the Piatts are taking it hard , Reverend , " he said . " We 're all taking it hard , Seranus , " the preacher answered . " Yes , but not like them , Reverend . They 've fetched their own preacher in it . They claim it was him done it . " Harry Donner heard incredulously . " You mean me ? They think I could control a bolt of lightning ? " The tow-haired giant in overalls and jumper stood there with lowered head . " They claim it was n't lightning , Reverend . They 're sayingsomebody started it in the new church and it got to the old church by mistake . " Harry Donner did n't understand at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't believe it . After Seranushad gone , he went almost shaking across the road to Jenny in her summer kitchen to ask if she had heard anything . Her face grew cruel with feeling.  | " Oh , I could have told you long ago , Reverend , but I did n't want to make you feel bad . All summer them Piatts have been saying you were so sick and tired of fighting over the new church , you did n't know what to do about it no more . They said every time a storm came and it cracked close , you went to the window hoping the new church was struck so you and everybody else could forget it . " Papa was white , Mamma told him , when he came back to the parsonage . He did not reveal what Seranus and Jenny had said . This was something between him and God , and this time he felt that God had gone too far . He was fifty-odd years old . Eleven of those years had been given to the Lord in seminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cleric or layman had anyone to his knowledge imputed what he would have denounced as a wicked slander against any Christian , let alone a minister of the Gospel . " Now loose me , Lord , and let me go , " he prayed during the night while Mamma slept . But nothing happened . No relief came , no light within or without . Nothing was seeminglygoing to happen to lessen his burden . This was his cross and he would have to bear it . A non-follower of Christ , he told himself , would have had it easier . He could have gone after his detractors and had it out with them tooth and nail . But a Christian was obliged to turn the other cheek , to walk the second mile , to let the veins of the flesh boil and yet be meekly satisfied with such thin comfort as Matthew , five eleven , " Blessed are ye when men shall revile you andp173say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake . Rejoiceand be exceeding glad , for great is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a long way off , or so he hoped , whereas close at hand festered abominationand " all that maketh a lie , " while justice was left to languish and wither on the vine . His only comfort was that he would not have to preach to the Manada Hill congregation this Sunday while the angerworked in his blood . To be mild and submissive to the Piatts now would be an almost impossible task . Then Friday evening Jenny called that the council had asked for the barn floor for services since the farm stood nearest to the burned churches . Also , Phillip had a stack of oak and chestnut lumber that might be used for pews . Saturday morning Harry Donner helped a group of men fill sacks with grain from Phillip 's granary . Upon these were laid the planking . Phillip 's corn sheller was set up as lectern and pulpit . No Piatt came then but Sunday morning they showed up for services . How they looked , the preacher did n't know , for he dared not turn his glance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there save George 's girl , Esther , who had to stay home and keep the switchboard open . It must have been the fire , the preacher reflected , that had brought them out and most everyone else as well . The planks could n't hold the congregation . Men sat on piles of hay thrown to the side of the barn floor , while boys and young girls climbed to the mows , where they looked pleased to at/tend church in a barn . The small door behind the preacher had been thrown open to give him light for the Bible he had fetched under his arm from his study since both pulpit Bibles had been burned up . The big doors behind the congregationstood wide open and through them the preacher could see Wetherill Valley rolling on to Fourth Gap , where Nippenose and Logan mountains joined . It was a warm August morning but the air that drifted through the barn was cool and pleasant , bitten with the scent of dried grasses and wheat which Phillip 's neighbors had harvested for him . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear the sounds of horses , calves and chickens in the stables below , and of Caesar , the old Holstein bull , rattling his chain in his stall . These were sounds and scents , he reflected , and this was a scene not unfamiliar to the Lord as a newborn babe , but never had the holy child had so lofty and fine a stable . He kept thinking about it as the choir sang , their voices sounding curiously childlike and pure without benefit of an organ in this open place . He felt that at least for the moment he had his Old Adam under control . Still he did n't trust himself to look at Oliver Piatt , the chief slanderer , remembering that this was n't the only mischief the man had done him . Here behind his corn-sheller pulpit , Harry Donner told himself again that of all human qualities , those of humility , meekness and forgiveness must be the most godlike and difficult for man to attain , for he had been try/ing for years to practice them , with very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation in divine worship and the most humble and traditionally Christian of places , he himself , an ordained ambassador of Christ , sworn to walk in the footsteps of the Master , found it the hardest thing in the world to deny the hot blood of the flesh and affirm the spirit to forget and forgive . After the service he made an effort to steel himself so that , despite the slander that everyone there must know , he might stand at the big barn doors and shake hands as usual with everyone that came out , especially the Piatts , with whom he must smile , chat and act as if nothing had happened . He noticed that Oliver did not leave with his family but waited to talk to other men on the barn floor . He was almost the last to go . " Reverend , " he said , shaking hands , " I think we done pretty good for a makeshift here today , but you know and I know it ca n't last . Winter is coming and we do n't have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mondayand get started building as soon as we can . " " I think so , too , Oliver , " the preacher agreed slowly . " But I do n't know rightly where we can meet except at Phillip 's since he ca n't go anywhere . " To his surprise , Oliver 's face did not harden . " Well , Reverend , I guess that 's all we can do . In fact I said as much to the rest . I told them we got to get some kind of meetinghouse up in a hurry . We do n't have timep176for wrangling now . I talked to all the council except Clint Miller . I 'll call him up when I get home . I 'll tell him like I did the rest to come to Phillip 's tomorrow night at the usual time . " Harry Donner went home startled and a little mystified . He felt , as valley folks said , beat out . Here he had been trying in vain for weeks to get the Piatts , especially Oliver , to visit Phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had managed it in a little more than a day or two . Certainly Oliver would n't refuse Jenny 's tasty rolls when she set out refreshments tomorrow night . Just the same , before he rejoiced too far , he better wait and see how the Lord managed it from here on . So far as he was concerned , he would keep out of it and let the Lord do it . Come to think of it , there was one thing he could do . That was keep a tight hobble on his " dutch " and act toward the Piatts as he had today . It was just possible he had helped the Lord a little without knowing it , holding his fire , treating the Piatts as decent honest men , returning good for evil . Once before in his life he had observed that when a man goes too far blackguarding another , he feels shame for himself in his heart and is ready next time to go a little more than halfway to make up for it.  |p177Johnny  tried to make out his father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he had been no more than a child sent to the store for a spool of darning cotton . Now he was almost grown , past his sixteenthbirthday , and had been on a man 's job in the city . He was experienced enough , he guessed , to see and understand what had been veiled to him before . Just the same , all the way from the western part of the state he had dreaded the reunion . He was coming back jobless , defeated , a failure like the prodigal son . But if his father felt disappointment or disgrace , he gave no hint of it . " Johnny ! " his hearty voice called , and the black-garbed figure strode across the Wetherill station platform . The boy felt the well-known mustache-tasting kiss . " This is John , my oldest boy , " he introduced him with pride to an older man on the platform . " He 's been working for the Westinghouse Machine Company in East Pittsburgh . "  |p178As  the host , he insisted on carrying the battered Donnerfamilysuitcase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he had protested vigorously when Johnny tried to hold on to it . " I 'll have one of my members bring out your trunk . That 's the new Wetherill school up there on Henderson Hill . " On the way from the station he pointed out half a dozen landmarks . If he felt any less warmth for the son than in Mahanoy , the latter could n't detect it . " What do you think of our Pompy ? " he demanded , pleased , stopping before an ordinary prick-eared bay hitched to a muddy-wheeled wagon . He stowed the suitcase under the seat and they started out grandly . " You 're now going up Houston Hill , " he announced , calling it " Howston " in the local manner , and later , " This end of Wetherill is called town , town , " giving the boy a vigorous pinch on the leg before each word and laughing immoderatelyat his little joke on the name of Pinchtown . At home Johnny thought he felt confusion in his mother 's eye that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . But his father was in high spirits , especially at the table , relating jovial and even uproarious valley incidents . No one could carry things off like his father . After supper he took the boy across the road where the brick walls of the new church were rising from the ruins . For much of an hour he treated him as someone his own age , confiding all that had happened , pointing out future details of unfinishedp179sanctuary and Sunday-school rooms , describing doors , windowsand furnishings still to be . " I have my text for the first sermon all picked out , " he promised . The boy heard with strange recurrent sensations . He had forgotten all this . Now he was back again among the old ecclesiastical influences , his ear assailed by the peculiarlydry and sterile vulgate of the church , his young life faced by the stern presence of rituals and sacraments , of vows and austerities , of obligations and constraints , all underthe overhanging shadow of the cross . He remembered that his father used to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet in this church as in many another the boy could feel only bare and empty walls and a strange mystic silence like that of the Sphinx in the desert . It was in the parsonage that to him the river of life flowed , the rooms and walls strong with refuge and peace , with freedom and the warm presence of his mother . " I want you to see all the churches , Johnny , " his father said with pleasure . " And meet the people . Wonderful peoplehere . Maybe you 'd like to ride along to male-quartet practice at the Frame Church tomorrow night . " What his father called the Frame Church turned out to be a rather narrow building standing lone and desolate on the top of a hill . Fields surrounded it but hardly a human habitation was to be seen , only the white stones of the ad/joining cemetery . The other singers had not yet come . His father unlocked the door and took him in . The air tasted stale with the certain dry dusty smell of churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pews straight and stiff , their color an archaic hand-grained yellow . Yet the boy noticed that his father 's eyes had lighted as if he saw beauty here . " I preached last Sunday on David and the eye of Mars , " he said , giving a few points of the sermon , reciting in a dramaticvoice , " When the eye of Mars looked down on the earth , it was red with exceeding fury , and the quality of mercy appeased it not . ' " He added , pleased , in his natural voice , " Several people told me they liked my sermon . " The boy sat that evening on a back pew trying to fathom it out . The church lay in darkness save the square of choir lighted by an oil lamp or two flickering on the brown unpaintedbeams overhead and the faces of the four men . They went over their piece again and again . One verse haunted the watching and listening boy . Ashamed of Thee , oh , sooner farLet midnight blush to own its star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this benighted , soul of mine . Exactly what it was he did n't know , but something troubled him in the melancholy words and minors , in the shabby furnishings of the church , in the remoteness of thep181scene , in the dim oil lamps against the ancient mystery , and in these four benighted men in the lonely reaches of this dark valley singing of the light of a mystical and incarnate star . But while it faintly chilled the boy , it warmed his father and the three other men . He could tell it by the way they sang . There was power of a kind here . The boy could not be certain of its nature or its source . The power still lived in his father that night at the home of the tall farmer who sang second bass , and it had not burned out next morning when Papa , dressed and down long before his son , called vigorously up the narrow , twistingfarmhouse stairs . " Johnny ! The sun is up and it is day . " This is the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad in it . ' " How his father had preserved such energy and wellbeingimprisoned as they both were in the spare bedroom without a single decoration on the white walls , Johnny did n't know . He had never seen him in better fettle . Last night at family worship before going to bed he had prayed , " When the fever of life is over and our labor done , then in thy great mercy grant us safe lodgings and a holy rest , and peace at the last , but if our toil remains and our life abides , call us up at the rising of the sun with morning faces and morning hearts , " and here he was at the breakfast table giving joyful thanks " for the rest and care of the night , for having been permitted to look on the light of another day , for the air we breathe , the food we eat prepared byp182kind hands and for the raiment that we wear . " He ate heartily and praised without stint the black coffee , the fried eggs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is wonderful , Mother , wonderful ! " he said to the pleased old woman by the stove . They left by midmorning . " I want you to meet some more fine people , Johnny , " he said on the yellow road , keeping tab on his watch and turning in to another farm in time to be invited to dinner where he prayed , " Bless us in things temporal and spiritual , in basket and store , in field and home . Grant to farmers and keepers of cattle good seasons and to travelers and harvestersfair weather . " Later he gave a special prayer for the smaller children who did n't get to the first table and who kept coming to the door to show off in front of the preacher and then run before their parents could seize them . They were on the road again by late afternoon . Pompy , full of oats , jogged along willingly . Johnny hoped they were headed for home but his father had other notions . " I want to tell you a little something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people but they 've had some hard luck and they 've never got over it . " He turned into a long straight lane . Perhaps it had been his father 's words , but there seemed to be something unhealthyabout the low , heavy , flat land after the bright hill farms where the wind blew , and about the huge , gray , un/painted barn and darker weathered house standing silent and almost deserted-looking in the shadow of decaying maples . " What sort of bad luck ? " Johnny asked . " Their son was hung , " his father said . " Here 's Mr. McPhail coming now . I 'll tell you about it later . Just act like I did n't tell you anything . " A woodenlike figure was coming toward them across the field . At a little distance he looked red with the lowering sun but when he came close the boy told himself he had never beforeseen a face like dead meat . The hand given to Johnny was putty . " I 'll take care of him , Reverend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on in . She 'll be looking for you . " " What 's the matter with him ? Is he drunk ? " the boy whispered on the way to the house . His father gave him a nudge , and Johnny saw that a redeyedwoman had come out of the house and now stood waiting . " How are you , Mrs. McPhail ? " his father called , as if to visit such a place and people were the most agreeable thing in the world . " Is it you , Reverend ? " she asked . " I was hoping it was . I 'm glad you remembered us . I was saying to him only yesterday , I believed you 'd forgotten us . " " I was here only a month ago , " Johnny 's father reminded.  | " But you would n't stay for a meal . And who 's this with you ? Not your boy . He do n't look like you . " " This is our oldest , Johnny , " his father said , pleased . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! " she said , taking the boy 's hand and starting to cry . " I can remember when Marlin was just like him . " Papa did n't seem to mind her . He stood by , saying pleasant , matter-of-fact things till the woman remembered to take them into the house , where she opened the closed parlor and they sat around in the bleak room hung with the framed color enlargement of a youth . Papa tried to keep the talk on crops , weather and neighbors , but the woman kept bringing it around to the boy on the wall . " We knew Effie was no good for him , Reverend ! " she cried out once . " But we could n't do nothing . They was n't made for each other . She 'd go home and he 'd bring her back . This last time she said she was going for good , that she 'd take his child along and he was n't to come for it again . It was a day like today . Only it was Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel like going to church when he and Effie were fighting all the time , but we never dreamed anything like that . When we got home , it was too late . " She was weeping violently now . Getting up , she brought Johnny a tin object from the parlor table and put it in his lap . " This is the last plate he ate from . They gave him hisp185breakfast on it the day they done that to him . He wanted ham and fried potatoes . He said that 's what his mom alwaysused to make for him . He said nobody could fry potatoeslike his mom , and nobody could cure ham like his pop . This is the cup he drank his coffee from . He liked it strong . And this is the last knife and fork he ate with . The sheriff gave them to Hughie . He wanted to give the rope , too , but I said he could keep that . I did n't care what he done with it . I heard he took it home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house and says who was hung with it . " Johnny could tell from his father 's resigned face that he had heard this several times before . He sat quietly , letting the bitter woman go on . When she was spent , he got down on his knees and offered a long prayer . After that she seemed better and got supper . " Why was he hung ? " Johnny asked when Mrs. McPhail was in the kitchen . " For murder , " his father told him briefly . " But who did he murder ? " the boy persisted . " His young wife and child , " his father said . " In the kitchen out there . He buried them under the manure pile . He told his parents he had taken them home to her mother . " The sense of ugliness and oppression that had been growingon Johnny turned into horror . He could scarcely eat supper in this place . He kept seeing the bloody bodies of a young mother and her child in the dark corners of the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual ,  |p186sitting  heartily up to the table , repaying the hospitality as always with prayer and compliments , ignoring the tragedy as though it had taken place in some past age and now all had been washed clean by time or at least diluted to a faint residue . Throughout the meal the boy waited only to get away . Once it was over , he asked his father if it was n't time to go . " We ca n't run off the minute we eat , Johnny , " Papa said firmly . " Besides , I want to visit with the McPhails a little . " As if his small word of sympathy had touched off her misery afresh , the woman started crying again . She had been doing the dishes and the boy could see drops falling into the dishpan . " Now , now , Mrs. McPhail , " Papa said . " Everything 's going to be all right , " which only seemed to make her worse . " It 's Effie 's folks give her the most trouble , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can about Marlin . " " Is it true , Reverend , " Mrs. McPhail cried , " that a murderer can never enter the kingdom of heaven ? " " Well , " Papa said thoughtfully , " we 're told in the Bible that Moses killed an Egyptian . It 's hard to think that Moses never reached heaven . We 're also told that though our sins are scarlet , they shall be white as snow . You told me once that Marlin made full confession to his pastor and begged for forgiveness at the end . I think we can believe that his prayers were answered . "   " But they claim he committed the unforgivable sin , " Mrs. McPhail said brokenly . " They say that 's what it is if you hate and destroy your own child . " " I 'm not sure that Marlin hated his child , " Papa said . " I rather think he meant to hurt his wife by hurting the child . There 's a Greek myth along the same lines . I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to point out that God himself made us , understands us and is merciful to us , and we should n't impute to him our own human passions for vindictiveness and revenge . " Mrs. McPhail did n't seem to hear . She stood with hands helpless in the dishpan , her head bent over it . She seemed unable to see . " They say Marlin 's in the place of torment right now ! " she cried out . " They say he 's been there all this time since he done it . They say he begs day and night for a few drops of water but that nobody through all eternity can give it to him . They say when me and my man die we 'll have to stand there watching Marlin in the sea of fire . We 'll have to listen to him beg for water and never be able to give him none . " Johnny twisted unhappily over the tears and emotion , the baring of mind and soul , the sight of a grown man and woman standing in misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room he hated more , the bloody kitchen or the second room with its revolting tin plate , cup and spoon together with the ghastly picture on the wall . " I 've got to go out , ' " he blurted , and bolted.  |p188Once  in the darkness peopled with unknown shapes and shadows , he regretted it . He was still close to the kitchen door the murderer must have used . Under his feet lay the very path over which had likely been dragged or carried the butchered bodies . A few yards off his eyes could make out dimly the barnyard where they had been buried . Every mysterious stamp and bump in the barn gave him a start . So this , he told himself bitterly , was beautiful Wetherill Valley that his father , mother and brothers liked better than Port Oxford ! If he knew where the parsonage lay , he would get out of this horrible place . He believed his feet at first would little more than touch the ground . But he did n't know the way , and at night there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , and still his father did n't come out . He could hear the piteous voice of Mrs. McPhail running on and on in the house . At the end he climbed into the deserted buggy . His father 's hand on his shoulder wakened him . Sitting erect he saw Mr. McPhail with a lantern holding up the " shavvs " for the horse . The buggy dipped as Papa got in and picked up the lines . Pompy , anxious for home and stable , was already wheeling and breaking into a trot while his father called reassuring good nights to the McPhails . " They 're poor benighted souls , " he said with feeling as they drove out the lane . " I guess I stayed too long . I phoned Mamma we 'd be late . I had to wait till Mrs. McPhailsettled down so I could talk to her . I wanted to givep189her what comfort I could that her boy would be all right . " " I do n't see how you could tell her such a thing ! " Johnny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are three things I try to tell my people , " Papa said . " First that God forgives sins , all sins including the blackest , if the sinner is truly sorry and tries to live aright . Secondly , that salvation , eternal life is open to all , even to the worst of us , through the grace of God . And thirdly , that these things are really and wonderfully true . " " How does anybody know they 're really true ? " the boy demanded . " I know what I believe , " his father answered him stoutly , and went on , quoting , " I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I 've committedunto him against that day . ' " " But belief does n't make things so , " Johnny said passionately . " Look at what the Hindus and Orientals believe . Lots of our own people , some of the most intelligent , say there 's no God and no eternal life . They say when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries and nuns and the saints who think the Lord or angels go with them and help them are only deluding themselves . They say that all those who give up everything for a religious life cheat themselves out of their real place in the world , out of pleasure and happiness , out of doing what they want to and making the most out of the only life they 'll ever have . " His father was bitterly silent for a while.  | " Do you believe that , Johnny ? " " If somebody proved it 's true , I 'd believe it . But would you ? " " Go slow , Johnny , on what you believe . The Bible says , as a man thinketh in his heart , so is he . You ask if it was proved that all I believe in and stand for is n't true but is a swindle , the greatest swindle on earth , would I believe it ? I do n't know how you or anybody else would ever prove it . But if some thought they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm already doing what I want to do right now , getting a lot out of the only life you say I 'll ever have . I think I 'm already pretty well off , healthy , happy in my job , happier than most people I meet , especially those who do n't believe in anything . I think my belief that God personallysupports me , and that his presence and angels go with me , gives me grace to do what I 'm called on to do and peace of mind while I 'm doing it . Now let 's take it your way . Let 's say that what you and your wise men say is really true  --  that all I believe in is n't true , that the Bible and Lord Jesus , God forbid , are n't true ; that going around preaching the Gospel and salvation and trying to do good like him are n't true . Well , in that case , when I 'd die , I 'd never find out it was n't true and neither would you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now let 's take it while we live . Which way do you suppose I 'd be the happiest and healthiest and get the most out of life for myself and those I try to do things for , going around practicingp191my belief and believing it true , even though it 's false , or believing it false and going around believing it false , even though such a belief according to you would be true ? " The boy could n't answer that one . It troubled him . He had always believed that truth was truth and best for you even if it killed you . Now he wondered if there was more than one truth about the same thing , one truth that hurt you and one that blessed . From time to time as the wheels rolled along , he kept watching his father . How could he sit there shaking the lines over Pompy 's back so late at night after such an exhausting day , humming with feeling the air from the quartet last night ? He sends his beams of light divineOn this benighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still light in the house downstairs when they reached home . His mother stood in the kitchen doorway . A wood fire burned in the cookstove and the smell of hot coffee hung in the air . " Well , I 'm glad you two got home before daylight , " she chided them . " Is Mrs. McPhail feeling a little better now , Hal ? "  |p192fall  God 's creation , the preacher thought , his finestwork had been woman . She was , when you reflected on her , a most divine and marvelous invention , one that could feel tenderness for the weak , pity for the suffering , could delight man , make his bed and supper , not to mention her astounding gift to conceive and perpetuate her kind . Man could n't begin to match her , but then God had made man first , more or less on the spur of the moment , and by the time he came to woman had had experience to surpass himself . There were exceptions , of course , but all through life Harry Donner had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already in infant baptism their superior character had begun to come out . They were less likely to protest water splashed from the font on their soft young pates , often laughed and gurgled to have their heads wetted . At two or three years they started to take hold of your coat or trouser leg . At five they were chubby sausagesp193of delight to romp with . They wanted to be lifted up and hugged when you left . They always had a kiss for you . But it was n't until they reached twelve or thirteen that the Lord 's handiwork became clearly visible . They were gentler now , more reserved , susceptible and perceptive to the stirrings of young womanhood . Their eyes trusted you , gave you their unspoken confidences . Their faces were often a picture . When certain of them lowered their lashes to read aloud from their catechism , he thought their lovelinessindescribable . But it was at fifteen and sixteen that they reached the fateful hour of bloom , like the clover in early June , unfoldedto completeness . They became shyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your face and merry behind your back . He thought of them as the young virgins the Lord had noticed in his day and spoken of in parables . Here on the remote reaches of back-country farms , with no models to follow or mirror , it seemed that the Creator 's blueprint for them came to its purest fruition . There was something about tender young souls and bodies in rude calico and often bare legs that reminded him of the slightly coarse yet incredibly sweet call of the whitethroatedsparrow in the brambles , the one Mamma called the Canada bird because it seemed to say , " Swee-eet Canada , Canada , Canada . " On the other hand , he fancied town girls and young Piatt females less unspoiled flowers of the race , more possessed , self-centered and appraising.  |p194Wild  or tame , he was devoted to daughters of all ages , having none himself . The pleasant honeyed thought of their presence ahead at this farmhouse or that lightened the lonely miles of pastoral travel . He had his name for each . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my girl , " " Where 's my girl ? , " " Here 's my girl ! " Only slightly less fond was " my sweetheart , " " my Janie , " " my pet . " " Here is my nice little girl " was a diminished term although spoken with undiminished smile and heartiness . A host of lesser appellations poured out of him like nectar , " Topsy , " " Sally wriggler , " " my hanswascht " and " Nixnutz , " which meant respectively clown and good-for-nothing . He loved to tease them but none , if he could help it , was slighted in his affection , none called pretty if a less attractive sister was around to hear or find out . Of all the girl crop in his charge , the apple of the preacher 's eye was Emma Severn . Emmaline , he called her , as he had his own sister of the same name . She came from an old unpainted house on the back road . It had chinked logs inside and out . To enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a beautiful girl like Emma was a delight like finding the yellow ladyslipper in the dark woods . She was devoted to church , seldom missed and invariablytold back the text and sermon to her house-bound mother , who in turn would take pride in reciting his last sermon back to the preacher when he called while herp195daughter quietly listened , smiled and prompted when necessary . There was something about Emma 's calm young womanhood and the silent way she went about the houseworkthat made him think of young Mary in Galilee . But he had to confess to Mamma that he could n't understand what he heard was her choice of a man . Why , he wondered , was the tenderest flower so often picked by the heavy hand ? What was the secret , almost devilish attractionbetween wildness and gentility ? If he , Harry Donner , were young and unmarried , Emma Severn was one he 'd think about going for , and yet her suitor , people said , was a worthless fellow from down below Allenburg . Jenny said he seldom had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed gunpowder to his bony nag to make him go faster . Every Wednesday and Saturday he put his red-wheeled runabout in the river to wash it . " There 's nothing wrong with that , Jenny , " the preacher said . " I wish Johnny or Gene would wash our buggy and road wagon twice a week . " " It 's about the only work he ever does around the place , " Jenny told him . " You think he 's good enough for her ? " " I would n't know that , " the preacher said . " Emma 's never brought him to service that I know of . " " She could n't get him inside of a church , " Jenny declared . " And if she could , he would n't have nothing to put in the collection . "  | " Now , Jenny , " the preacher protested . " You and Phillip did n't have too much either when he started to go with you , did you ? " " No , but Phillip was no Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat work or played fast and loose with a young girl like Emma Severn . " Now what did Jenny mean by that , the preacher wondered . He had not long to find out . One Saturday evening he sat in his upstairs study working on his sermon when he heard a rig stop outside . A long time passed before a knock sounded on the door . After a moment Vallie called him . He clogged downstairs and found a lean , bold-looking fellowwith limestone blue eyes and a shock of yellow hair . " Good evening ! " the preacher said cordially , shaking hands , wondering if he should know him . " Can I do anything for you ? " " Reverend , " the caller said in a kind of reckless unease , " my girl wants to get married and she wants you to do it . " " Why , I think that can be arranged , " the preacher assured him heartily . " Bring her around sometime and we 'll talk it over . " " She 's out here now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , I guess I could . " The preacher thought with a sigh of his unfinished notes on the desk upstairs . And yet a wedding was a more joyous occasion than preparing a sermon . But the fellow did n't go.  | " She wanted me to ask what you 'd charge . " " There 's no fixed charge . Anything you want to give . " " Would you take a bag of spitz ? " " A bag of snitz ? " The preacher was taken aback but he recovered quickly . " Why , yes , surely . Bring her in , and we 'll see what we can do . " When the fellow had gone to the buggy , Harry Donner opened the door to the kitchen that Mamma had discreetly closed . " The bridegroom cometh ! " he told her in high spirits . " Can you use any snitz ? I wonder if you 'd call up Jenny and ask if she 'd come over as a witness ? " He returned to the parlor smiling but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw that it was Emmaline . She had some early pansies from her garden pinned on her coat and carried a stuffed flour sack . She gave him a little smile , a brave pitiful smile , he thought . So this was Jenny 's no-good Allenburg fellow ? Well , all he could think of at the moment was St. Paul 's assurance that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the Christian wife . Throughout the ceremony the preacher was conscious of the hard face of Jenny as she watched , and of the tender , almost holy face of Emma Severn soon to be Emma Wilkes . When it was over , he spoke to them jovially , bringing in his happy matrimonial phrases . Then he sobered andp198asked the bridegroom upstairs to his study while he wrote out the marriage certificate . He closed the study door behind them . " Sit down , Mr. Wilkes , " he said . " I hope you realize what a fortunate man you are . Emmaline is a wonderful girl and will make a worthy and excellent wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than your honorarium would indicate . I do n't think you should let it get around the valley that you paid the preacher a bag of snitz for your wife . " " They 're her snitz , not mine , Reverend , " he retorted . " I have no doubt , " the preacher said . " I 'm sure she picked the apples and cut and dried the snitz with her own hand . But that 's no credit to you . I do n't think you should offer the preacher less than five dollars in your case , especially in front of Mrs. Rodey . If you do n't have the money , I 'll lend it to you . " He opened his pocketbook and found only three worn dollar bills . Mamma kept little more than silver change in the kitchen , he knew , but she had a five-dollar bill in the upper bureau drawer , and this he took and passed to the skeptical-eyed bridegroom . " Now I want you to hand it to me so Mrs. Rodey can see you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we go , there 's a verse from First Samuel that comes to me . The name of his wife was Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of beautiful countenance . ' I strongly feelp199that this applies to your wife , Emma . Your responsibility , now that you 've taken the step , is to honor and comfort her , sustain and support her . " " Reverend ! " Jenny called up the stairs . " I wonder if you could let me sign the paper and get back to the house ? The boys are alone over there . " Harry Donner turned to his desk , filled out the marriage certificate with a little less of his usual dash and flourish . Then they went together downstairs , where Jenny wrote her name as witness and left , followed by the bride and groom . Not until they were gone and the sound of the abruptly driven horse had died out did Harry Donner remember the five-dollar bill . He said nothing to Mamma . She would discover the missing bill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much about the money as for Emmaline and what lay ahead of her with this husband . He pondered the secret purpose of the Almighty that deserving men and women more often than not had spouses with opposite natures and dispositions . He knew the Lord 's stern injunction not to judge . However , the Lord had not told him to shut his eyes , and it was one of the crosses a preacher bore that he had to join in holy wedlock from which let no man put asunder , couples who were unfitted for the trials ahead and some of whom might dearly regret the step they had taken . All the next week he carried the cross . Saturday morning he spoke to Mamma.  | " I feel I 've failed , " he told her . " I mean in making our young people understand the holy significance of marriage , that it 's a symbol of the mystical and sacred marriage of Christ to the church , and should be approached with prayer and understanding and not with the blind passion of men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women on the other . " Mamma gave him a sharp glance . " I do n't know what you could have done . " " I might have preached some honest and informative sermons on marriage , " he said . " I could have pointed out the terrible responsibility of any man who promises to be more to his young woman than her father and mother and all the friends she has combined . I could have warned him of his awful guilt in inducing a girl by fair words and promises to exchange her mother 's house for some Dismal Swamp existence . I could have told him that I would n't so much blame a man for cheating another man out of a farm as I would for cheating a woman out of the happiness of a lifetime . " " It sounds very forthright , " Mamma admitted . " Do you think that Cupid would hear it ? " " I do n't know what you mean , " Harry Donner said . " But I intend to preach such a sermon tomorrow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his bitterness over Emmaline 's probable fate out of his system . He had hoped it would do more than that . He gave it first at the Manadap201Hill church . Almost no one commented on it , either then or at the Frame Church that evening . But at the Spring Garden church next Sunday afternoon , at least one hearer did , the widow of the late Harrison Todd . " I liked your sermon , Reverend , " she said . " I 'd like to talk to you about what you said when you come to the house . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " Harry Donner said , pleased . " I 'll be happy to talk to you about it . " The Todd farm lay in a great sloping meadow between Spring Garden Creek and Logan Mountain , excellent land , a square white house , a solid barn with stone ends and a number of outbuildings all white as the house . Harrison Todd had been a butcher and huckster . He had driven across Nippenose Mountain twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall the year around . His wife invariably accompaniedhim and her solid figure and rather pretty plump face were still a fixture at the market . She had kept up the stall after his death , driving over with her brother who farmed her land and lived in his own house across a small ridge . The lane between the two farms was well used as a road . The preacher took it today after calling on her brother 's family first so as to follow St. Paul 's advice of impartiality to all . Mrs. Todd kept a hired girl but let the minister in herself . In the parlor with the inevitable organ and white walls they settled on stiff green chairs.  | " Your sermon was a thinking sermon , Reverend , " she said . " And it set me to thinking . " " I wish , " the preacher said , " I might preach a sermon like that every Sunday . " " Yes , I thought about it in church . I thought about it at home . And I thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I 'm in hearty favor of marriage , " she assured . " In fact , I 've been thinking of getting married myself again and I want you to tie the knot . " The preacher was taken aback . Why , it was no more than eight months since he had said the last rites over Harrison . " Do you think enough time has passed ? " he ventured soberly . " A long enough time for me , Reverend , to be setting here alone . " " You 're not exactly alone , Mrs. Todd . You have Nelly Sites to help you when you need her . George does your farming and goes with you to market . Do n't you think you ought to wait at least a year ? A longer time would be still more suitable . " " Not me , Reverend , " she said . " When I want something , I want it . " He felt distaste rising in him . " Marriage is a holy institution and should n't be rushed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house full of children . If you do n't mind my speaking frankly as yourp203pastor , Mrs. Todd , I believe you 're of an age when you can no longer expect to serve God in this way . " He thought that her heavy face looked a little thoughtful and he remindedher gravely that while she was acquainted with the drawbacks of her present state , she was n't with those of the step she contemplated , especially if made in too much of a hurry . The Widow Todd sat like a female Buddha . " A man I want , Reverend , and a man I will have , " she declared . The preacher sat sobered . " You have someone in mind ? " " Oh , I have him all picked out already . " " Well , I hope you 're being led aright and that he is a Christian and God-fearing man . " Mrs. Todd looked stolid . " He 's a good enough Christian for me , Reverend . " " Do I know him ? " " Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sits in front of me every Sunday . I had my eye on him for a good while . I told myself this long time that he 's the one for me . He owns his own place and got a good business besides . He has money in the bank and no wife in his house or bed now for ten years . You know who I mean ? " Harry Donner ran his mind over his Spring Garden congregation . " You mean Jacob Reis ? "  | " No , he 's my second choice . I want Arthur Scovel first . " So that was who it was ! The preacher could see Arthur clearly in his mind as if he had suddenly stepped into the room , a tall spare man with dark eyes and red , almost purple , cheeks , his hat and clothes and spade beard dusted with the white from his mill . " He knows about this ? " " Not yet but he 's going to . I 'd like if you 'd talk to him and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher grew stern . " I 'd prefer if you select someone else as your messenger , Mrs. Todd . I do n't think it falls in the province of a minister . " The Widow Todd never budged . " You 're my pastor , Reverend , " she said stubbornly . " You 're the one who has to tie the knot and you 're the one who has to help me get him . Unless you 'd sooner see me get him foul than fair . " Harry Donner flushed but refused to be blackmailed . " I had three years in the seminary , Mrs. Todd , but no instruction as a matchmaker or marriage broker . I was taught that marriage is a holy institution in which a man and woman are to be decently joined together in a civil contract for the prevention of uncleanness , for the propagationof mankind and so the contracting parties may be of mutual help and comfort to each other . " " That 's exactly what I need a man for , Reverend , " shep205said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep me warm . No matter how many quilts I put on , it do n't help . My back gets like a sheet of ice . You can lay your hand on it right now , Reverend , and tell me if I do n't tell the truth . " She began undoing her waist and the preacher 's stern distaste turned into displeasure . He remembered gratefully the stern words of Vallie 's father to the woman who wanted to show him the sore on her thigh . " Ich will 's net sehna , " he had declared . Thank God for the old preacher . " As your pastor I have nothing to do with that , Mrs. Todd , " Harry Donner said shortly . " You can ask Dr. Metzgar about it if you like . Now I must go . I 've one more call to make on the Spring Garden road and get back to prayer meeting at Manada Hill tonight . " The Widow Todd looked alarmed . " You 're not going already , Reverend . I expected you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me all year . " " I 'll come and eat with you on my next pastoral visit , " he promised . " I 'll bring Mrs. Donner along . " The solitude of the buggy , the celibacy of Pompy and the austerity of the road had never seemed more solid and satisfying than today . Woman might be God 's later and higher creation but some of them were a throwback to Eve . He gave Widow Todd a cool look when he greeted her in the Spring Garden church on Sunday , and no intimationp206to Arthur Scovel what had been revealed to him . He heard later that Mrs. Todd was taking her grain to Scovel 's Mill personally , having it ground for what flour , chop , shorts and bran she needed . He heard other things , some that made him think of the verse from Proverbs , " Stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant . But he knoweth not that the dead are there . " Mrs. Pumphrey , wife of the storekeeper at Spring Garden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't marry the miller . Within six months Mrs. Todd herself asked him to perform the ceremony and all through the service she bore a secret and triumphant look on her fleshy face . Now that her marriage to the miller was to become an established fact , the preacher put into the rite and the prayer that followed every effort for an auspicious and heaven-blessed union , while in private talks with his Maker on the lonely roads of the valley , he requested that his own doubts and reservationsin the matter be overlooked and forgotten . Just the same , folks told him within the year that the miller had moved back to his own house by the creek , spendingonly Saturday night and Sunday with his bride , during which time , Nelly Sites said , they fought like cat and dog . Nelly also reported that the new Mrs. Scovel charged her husband for the oats and hay he fed his horse on the weekend , while he in turn deducted an eighth for the grain she sent to the mill to be ground . They still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep207preacher noted that they came to service in different rigs , sang from separate hymnbooks , took their respective offeringsfrom their own pocketbooks and turned their backs on each other after the sociability at the door . It made him a little sad to have the thing turn out this way , but not nearly so sad as to see the once lovely and promising Emma Severn now gaunt and almost slatternly , nursing her second child and giving her minister a reproachfullook as if for not saving her but rather contributingto her misery . It troubled him . His prayer for couples joined together by him had always been joyful and expectant . He had prided himself that he " could tie a good knot , " that his marriages had turned out well , that the participants remained true to each other and lived in seeming happiness . Now lately two products of his hand had foundered . Was his grace with God beginning to fail , his pronouncements in the name of the Father coming under divine disfavor ? He had been thinking these gloomy thoughts today when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan Singer and his common-law wife , Dolly . They lived on a little place near the river . Dan was a machinist with the chair works at Watsontown , a huge man with deep shoulders , a partly bald head and a tremendous face . He was a voracious reader , a longtime subscriber to the Appeal to Reason , and , it was said , liked to hold forth on politics and economics to Dolly , who confessed happily she could neitherp208read nor write . She was a blond , blowsy woman always laughing so that her flesh shook like siterle . Toward the end of his call , the preacher brought up again the old objective . " I wonder , dear friends , if before I go you would do me a personal favor ? " " Sure . What is it ? " Dan said . " Let me say the common service over you and hear your responses ? " " He means civil and sacred marriage , " Dan explained to Dolly . Dolly laughed with embarrassment and looked at her man as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful lips . " I do n't think so , Reverend , " Dan said judicially . " Now I hope you know I have nothing against you personally . If I believed in the dead dictums of the past , you 'd be the one man of the cloth I 'd want to do the job . But as you know , I 'm a dissenter . No empty formalities for me . I take support from your own holy Bible . In one of his epistles your St. Paul tells you , Come out from among them and be ye separate . ' Does n't he now ? At another place he gets down to cases . He says , He that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better . ' Could anything be clearer ? Even your great prophet , Jesus Christ himself , says very plainly in three different books , Matthew , Mark and Luke , that in the resurrection mortals neitherp209marry nor are given in marriage but , he says , are like the angels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the excuseand argument for civil marriage ? As for me and Dolly , we 're satisfied to remain on God 's footstool like the angels in Heaven . " Harry Donner smiled ruefully . An ordinary person like himself could never hope to outreason Dan Singer . If he remindedhim of the Lord 's approval of marriage in attending the marriage at Cana , Dan would come back with a whole salvo of rebuttal . They had threshed this matter out before and the preacher had not come out a winner . Now if Dan and Dolly were n't childless , it would be a horse of another color . Then he would have irrefutable arguments . Indeed , if there were only one babe , already born or in store , he would throw himself into its cause and not give up until he had got the innocent a semblance of lawful parentage . The preacher sighed . It was a pity for more than one reason . The marriage of Dan and Dolly Singer would be something to cheer him up at this time . He could pronounce them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their happiness . It was a union to bank on , for already it enjoyed a true and tried basis to go on.  |p210V  aleria Donner sat very still . She looked asleep but was thinking . Winter nights on Manada Hill the parsonageseemed like a shell . The wind from Nippenose Mountain shook it , rattled the windows , poured through the unseen cracks with icy fingers of draft . Up in Gene and Johnny 's room , the snow often lay on their covers till morning . Those two read Physical Culture Magazine and insisted on openingtheir window on the coldest nights . Their bedroom lay over the second parlor , which had to be closed for the winter . The Reverend Cannons must have heated it , for there was a darkened pipe hole to the chimney but the Donners owned only one heater . Its isinglass panes glowed red in front of her in the parlor now . They were all out tonight , Hal at the Frame Church , Johnny in town , Gene at a box social and Timmy studying with Bill Mast , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she was their Stone School teacher . The onlyp211family member left with her was Dixie , the yellow shepherd dog , good enough company except when he deserted for some female dog receptive to male callers , often miles away . He lay very faithful and domestic now , a furry lump on the carpet by the heater , his nose between his paws , never opening his eyes unless she moved or sighed , paying not the slightest attention to the occasional sleigh bells that passed . When first they lived in the valley she had expected the sound of every rig to be that of Hal . By now she had learned not to look for him till Dixie gave the signal . Long before she could even hear a sleigh bell or buggy wheel , he would be on his feet by the door whining to be let out . Where would they be next year at this time ? she wondered . Much of this summer she had observed that Hal was getting restless . She could detect the telltale signs , his preoccupationat meals , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Paul 's missionary travels and on the text from Ruth , " Whither thou goest , I will go . " Oh , Hal had held out pretty well here , she thought , keeping away from the usual church and choir squabbles . He had endured the murmuring of certain members that he did n't take a meal often enough with them , that he was friendlier to others than themselves , that he had his parish pets . But these were minor complaints . He suffered more from occasional fault finding with his sermons , as when AmbroseMcAndrew told him his preaching on the loneliness of Christ belittled the sublime sacrifice of the Lord of Lordsp212and King of Kings . And for a week or two Hal had actually bled from a letter written by a valley sectarian and printed in the Wetherill paper , calling him a falsifier of truth and acolyte of the devil for declaring that God would forgive all who came to him with an humble and contrite heart . But on the whole , Hal had ridden over these smaller waves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . Oliver Piatt was the thorn in Hal 's side that would not be withdrawn . It was n't the pig business . That had been left behind . Neither was it Oliver 's practice of inviting Reverend Cannon back to the valley to officiate at certain Piatt clan marriages and funerals , and not ask his present pastor to assist or even attend . When that happened Hal would be a little " down in the mouth " for a while and she would regret the loss of a five- or ten-dollar Piatt perquisite which the Donners could desperately use . But the cross always passed . Making Hal come like a beggar month after month for his own salary was the pernicious cancer in his blood . Jim Dietrich , treasurer of the Frame Church , paid his congregation 's apportioned salary regularly in cash , and George Humphrey , being a businessman , sent his small check for the Spring Garden church by mail . Oliver might easily have done the same for Manada Hill , but he insisted on his pastor calling at the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oliver had said simply , " Come and see us next week , Reverend , and your money will be ready . " Hal thought he would make his pastoral call atp213the same time and kill two birds with one stone . But next month it had been the same . After a year of it , Hal had asked him to send the money , but Oliver always had a good excuse . He said he had " some things to talk over " or he had an old church record to show him or one of the family was ailing and would like to see him . It meant an extra two-mile drive in the buggy each way and , what was more , favoring Oliver Piatt with more pastoral calls than anybody save the very sick . After several years of it , Hal had rebelled . In the spring with the valley full of the bedfast and afflicted , he had stayed away and the second month after church service had asked Oliver for the money . But Oliver had been equal to the occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sabbath . Besides , he never carried his checkbook or that much cash to church . Hal talked it over with Seranus Mast and Phillip , who had been trying for years to get Oliverout of the treasurership . They urged him to stand fast , but in the end when there was n't a dime left , Hal had to eat crow and go to Oliver Piatt hat in hand . Even so , Mamma thought Hal would have made the best of it if Oliver had n't said what he had in front of the ManadaHill church council . " You would n't run out of money , Reverend , " he told him , " if you did n't let your three boys lay around the house all the time . " Criticism on himself Hal could take , but not on his boys . Why , Tim was still going to Wetherill High School andp214Gene had graduated only a few months ago . Council meetinghad been on Monday night and Mamma had heard about it from Jenny on Tuesday . Still she had no inkling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Papa in church next Sunday and heard him preach what they afterwards called " his terrible sermon on failure . " " Failure , failure , bitter failure ! " he had declared from the pulpit in a voice that shook them all . " What have we done with the time and talents that God gave us ? He will say , Take therefore the talent from him . . . for from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath . And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ' " At the end in a voice strong with feeling he announced that he was leaving Wetherill Valley early in the new year . It startled Mamma and the boys . They knew he had no place as yet to go . Men from the three churches pleaded with him to reconsider and stay but Oliver was not among them , and Hal said he could n't undo what he had spoken . Mamma thought she understood . He had held back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after a fresh start had wiped the slate clean . Mamma looked down at the dog . " You 're going to miss it here , Dixie , " she said . They would all miss it . There was peace in this old countryparsonage even on a wintry night . From time to time someone was generally passing , the telephone generallyWater from the Wellringing to bring familiar faces from half the valley into the house . There were fourteen on the line , three shorts for the Manbecks , a long and two shorts for the Quincy Piatts , a short and two longs for the Ray Piatts , four longs for the Haverstraws , and four quick shorts for Dr. Metzgar at Spring Garden . Many a night waiting to see if it was their own ring , she had heard those alarming four shorts in the small hours , and said a prayer for the one who needed him and another for the good doctor who had to crawl out of bed and hitch up his horse . Their own ring of five shorts was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to miss the telephone , " she told herself . But in her heart she knew it was the people she would miss most , the valley 's old-time American stock , individual , refreshingin what they did and said . How would Hal preach without old Bartholomew Maddox leaning forward on the pew ahead when he agreed with the sermon and sitting straight back as a post when he did n't . " You pulled old Bartholomew front three times today , Papa , " Johnny or Gene would tell him . Valley people liked to be themselves , to put their own stamp on a word or saying . Some of their babies got " amonia " and were " so unrestless . " Instead of " God is no respecterof persons , " Dan Felty used to say , " God do n't respectnobody . " Martha Shellhammer said she did n't have time to go in her closet and pray . She had to do her praying and hymn singing when she could , mostly milking . She saidp216the stock liked to listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tribulation . Jake Loy would get up from a dinner for the preacher and say , " Well , Reverend , none of us shirked his duty . " Jenny Rodey said " My land ! " or " My stars ! " at things you told her . Mamma had read those expressions in a book but she had never heard them spoken before . And Sammy Glass , the blacksmith , would yell when a horse or mule tried to kick him , " bang your old liver pin ! " Mamma had always meant to ask him what a liver pin was . Whatever else you might say , valley folks were good company . They had funds of endless stories , like the one Jenny told about her sister , Naomi . Naomi had taken too much medicine and was out of her head for a day . " Whose pants is them on the chair ? " she wanted to know from her bed . " Why , they 's Will 's , " Jenny had told her . " Who 's Will ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lay a while digesting that . " Can I get a look at him ? " " He 's down for Elizabeth . " " Who 's Elizabeth ? " " Why , your own daughter . " " Elizabeth , Elizabeth , well why do n't he bring her ? I want to see her if she 's my daughter . " " She 'll come . He 's fetching her and the baby . "  |p217Water  from the Well " What baby ? " " Why , Elizabeth 's baby . " Good God ! " sitting up . " Does Elizabeth have a baby ? " " Why , of course . You ought to know that . " " Who was the man that done it to her ? " " Why , George , her husband . " " Oh , she got a husband , " lying back again . Jenny said her hair kept " raring up " as she talked and listened to her own sister . Oh , Jenny alone had told her dozensof stories . And Hal brought literally hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told Hal when he offered to say grace at the table , " You can talk to the taters , Reverend , but it wo n't give you no more sausage , " and his wife said , " Some folks choke their victuals down dry , I wash mine down with coffee . " Then there was Hal 's tale about Mr. Ott , whose favorite expression was " You bet , " and favorite vice , tobacco . His wife died and she lay in the front room in her coffin . " She looks very nice and natural , " Hal had comforted him . Mr. Ott shifted his quid to the other side of his mouth . " You bet ! " he said . Oh , there were endless things to relate . She tried to pass on the best to Jess when she wrote . That reminded her . She owed Jess a letter now . She guessed she would have to drop Jess a hint or two about Hal leaving . One of the hints would be how Claude Mersey , the once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unionville , had written and asked Hal to come and preach in his big church in Brooklyn . But she would say nothing that Dr. Mersey wanted an assistant pastor and that Hal took the invitation as a trial sermon . You never knew . And she would say nothing about what Oliver Piatt had done to Hal . Jess still believed Hal head over heels in love with the valley and everybody in it , and so he was , Mamma thought . But a few here did n't love him so much as he did them . Just the same how could she and Hal trust themselves when it came time to say good-by to all their good friends in the valley , to Phillip and Jenny , to the Glasses , to the Billy Bosses and a hundred others ? She hoped they both would n't break down.  |p219What  Harry Donner liked best about his trip to Brooklyn were the train ride and the people . He enjoyed being among travelers in the day coach , sitting first with one and then another , getting to know them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped to see them again . On his return , Dr. Mersey  --  he did n't like to be called Claude any more  --  had offered to buy him a seat on the parlor car but the country preacher had declined . He told Dr. Mersey that when he went to Chicago to general synod , he had not taken a sleeper , preferring to sit up that night talking to fellow passengers in the smoker . He still exchanged letters with a man he had met on that train , a drummer from Ashtabula whose only son had been drowned . Now as his train rounded the last sweeping curve of the river , he sighed and realized that his holiday was over . One of the boys would be on the platform to meet him . Pompy would be in the buggy up the street and the burdens of his charge waiting for him beyond Houston Hill . The boyp220turned out to be Gene , and once they were on the frozen valleyroad it was plain how in his fumbling boyish way he wanted to know how things had worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions aside . He knew if he told Gene now , his thunder would be stolen . He would be talked out before he saw Mamma and the other boys . So he asked questions of his own about Mamma , about Fred Yorty , who had been kicked by a horse , about old George Washington Harmon and young Shelby Bashore , about Phillip 's sick cow , about Mrs. DeLong 's six-o'clock dinner and was it still on schedule for this evening , which was the main reason he had n't stayed another day in the city as he should have liked to do , not wanting to disappoint Mamma , for Mrs. DeLong 's dinners were a break in Mamma 's stay-at-home existence and something to be talked about in the valley . After Brooklyn and the warm friendly train , the parsonagelooked cold in the December landscape streaked with snow under the bare valley trees . They all greeted him as if he had been away for a month . Dixie jumped up with sharp whining barks , trying to lick his face . Later the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trips to hear a full account of his doings . " Is it a big church , Papa ? " Timmy wanted to know when he finished . " One of the biggest I think I was ever in , " Papa declared . " When I stood on the pulpit to preach it was like looking out over a city of faces . The stained-glass window behind thep221altar , they told me , cost I forget how many thousand and the organ five times as much . They do n't have to have a boy to pump it like at Mahanoy . It 's done electrically . The pews have green velvet cushions and carved crosses at the aisle like the Episcopalians . The Sunday school is n't just a big room with a smaller infants ' department like ours . Classes have their own rooms like at college . There are I do n't know how many bathrooms  --  and chairs , mind you , according to the size of the pupils . You never saw anything like it . The Bible class has hundreds of chairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forget the amount of the collection but I could hardly believe it . " " Did everybody come to hear you preach , Papa ? " Tim asked . " Not everybody , " Papa admitted . " They do n't want everybody to come . Not at the same time anyway . If all three or four thousand members came , there would n't be room for some of them to sit down . In fact , they do n't want any more members . They turn them away every week . You have to have mighty good references to get in there . Dr. Mersey told me they go over every applicant for membershipwith a fine-tooth comb . If they think he does n't fit into St. Martin 's , they do n't take him . If they think he wants to join so he wo n't have to help build a new church somewhere else , they send him away . " " It must be a very rich church , " Mamma murmured . " Did he tell you what the assistant pastor would get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa hedged . " He did say they would be very generous , probably two or three times what we get here . " Timmy licked his lips . " Tell us more , Papa ! " he begged . Papa obliged , warming to the memories of his visit . He told with enthusiasm of the trains , trolleys and ferries he rode in , of the street sights in New York and Brooklyn , of the size and importance of St. Martin 's , of its rich yearly income , of his stay in Dr. Mersey 's parsonage with two servantsand twelve rooms , and what Dr. Mersey had told him of the prominent men in his congregation , the staggering figuresof his budget and apportionment , his trips to Europe and the names of great people , churches and places of distinctionhe had visited . " Twelve rooms ! " Timmy said . " Did he say anything about Unionville and the old days ? " Mamma asked . " Not too much , " Papa said apologetically . " He does n't seem to remember Unionville like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He should remember his father and mother , " Mamma said , and when Papa did n't reply , " I remember them both very well . His mother wore a sunbonnet and his father was a nice old man . He gave me an apple once . They both thought the world and all of Pap-pa . Pap-pa married them , I think , and baptized all their children . " " Of course we must realize , " Papa said gravely , " thatp223such things may seem small to someone in Dr. Mersey 's position . He 's a very big man in the church now . It was nice of him to remember me and ask me over when I wrote him I was looking for another place . " Something in the way Papa said it made Mamma wonder . " I hope he offered you the assistant-pastorship ? " she said . You could see the three boys holding their breath . " Oh , yes , he said I could have it , " Papa answered . " If I wanted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Hal ? " Mamma persisted . Papa said nothing . His lower lip stood out . " Are n't we going to Brooklyn , Papa ? " Timmy quavered . His father looked unhappy . He faced Mamma doggedly . " I tried my best to accept it , Vallie , " he said . " I prayed hard over it but I just could n't feel the call . The salary would have been wonderful , but the people in the church did n't seem to need me . I felt they could get along very well without me . I did n't talk their language . I saw plenty of people whose language I did speak and they looked as though they needed me . I would have liked to work among them . But they were in the street and I do n't think St. Martin 's would have liked me to spend my time with nonmembersany more than St. Peter 's did . Besides , how could I go to these people with the Gospel when I knew my own church would n't take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked disappointed . " Did you have your lunch ? "  | " I did n't want too much , " Papa said , which probably meant that he had n't any . " I knew there 'd be plenty to eat at Mrs. DeLong 's tonight . But I 'd like to stop in at the Harmons ' and Bashores ' first . Do you mind if I call up Billy Ross and ask if he and his wife can take you ? You 'll have a fast ride behind his high steppers . Then I can get started right away and make a few calls on the way . " In a clean shirt he tied Pompy to the side of the old , closed , unpainted Harmon shop . He went to the back porch of the little house where young Mrs. Cal Harmon met him at the door . " He 's been saying your name ever since you went off , Reverend , " she said . The preacher took off his rubbers and went in . He felt suddenly refreshed , strong , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he greeted heartily . For a little it seemed that the old , very old man lying on the homemade chair in the kitchen was unable to speak . He might have been a long abandoned corpse of skin , bone and hair except for his eyes , very dark and very alive in the deep caverns under his brow . They had fastened on the caller'sface . When the voice spoke it was slow and abysmal as if coming out of the ground . " So you 're back , Reverend ? " he said . " Yes , and glad to be in the valley again . It 's good to go away and good to get back . " " They tell me you were off in Brooklyn and you 're going to move there . "  | " I do n't know who told you that , but I guess there 's nothing to it . " The strained look in the eyes relaxed . They warmed and moistened . " So you 're not going to leave us , Reverend ? " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair the woman had pulled up . " Let 's not talk about leaving you , Mr. Harmon , " he said . " Let 's just say that I 'm not leaving you for Brooklyn . " The old man lay silent a while . " I 've been thinking again , Reverend . All the time you were away I 've been thinking how the Lord 's forsook and forgot me . " " I do n't think the Lord ever forgets anyone , Mr. Harmon . Our names are written in the Book of Life and all the hairs of our head are numbered . " " Not mine , Reverend . I know what it says , but it 's had a slip-up somewheres . If a page ever had my name , it 's been lost . The Lord 's forgot I ever lived . For eleven years I been lying on this chair . For eleven years I been praying the Lord to take me . I 'm no good here , I tell him . He can see I 'm no good , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something better than have to take care of an old wornout soldier like me . But the Lord do n't hear me . I 'm forgot . It 's had a slip-up somewheres . " " It just seems that way to you , Mr. Harmon . No man knoweth the day or the hour when the Lord cometh . " " I know that , Reverend , and I always believed it . But hep226would n't treat me this way if he remembered . You know I always tried to do what was right . I took my younger brother'sdraft . He had a wife and babe and I had none them days . I was at Chancellorsville and Antietam . I never dodged my duty so far as I could help it . I took over Pap 's shop when I come home and took care of him and Mam while they was living . I never overcharged a man , even one I had no use for . Many 's the wagon I made or fixed up and took corn or potatoesfor it . The farmers them days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Frame Church since I turned eighteen . For nigh onto seventy-six years my name 's been on the church books , but it do n't do me no good . I believeit was on too long , Reverend , and that 's how I 'm for-got . " " The Lord has n't forgotten you , Mr. Harmon , " the preacher countered warmly . " He promised you long life in Exodus . You know the commandment , Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee . ' You took care of them . He 's taking care of you now . " " It sounds good when you 're young and strong , Reverend . But when you 're old and helpless hand and foot , them days can be too long especially when you ca n't get up to take care of yourself . Living to seventy might be all right or even eighty . But keeping you alive on a chair till ninetyfourjust because of a promise made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a favor , Reverend . The Lord wouldn'tp227do that if he come down and seen me as I am . A person can live too long , Reverend . Sooner die young when your name 's still on the muster rolls and the Lord remembers to call you home . " " I 'll always remember you , Mr. Harmon , " Harry Donnersaid . " And if a poor sinner like me remembers , you can depend on it that the Lord does . " He stayed as long as he could , visiting , telling of people he met in the train , singing two hymns for the old man before he left . Never had he a more reverent or appreciative audience than young Mrs. Cal Harmon standing by the stove and the old man lying on his homemade chair , his dark eyes lighting up at the words of his favorite hymn , " Beulah Land , Sweet Beulah Land . " After the prayer the gray cheeks had faint color in them and Harry Donner himself felt lifted that he could be of some service here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bashore farm . There was something pitiful about the house , and a set look on Walter Bashore 's face as he came out to put up the preacher 's horse . " Just give him a little hay , Walter . I ca n't stay long . I 'm promised at Mrs. DeLong 's for supper . She has something going on . " " Well , I 'm glad you could stop , anyway , " Walter Bashoresaid . He put off the inevitable subject . " Getting colder . " " Yes , it 's about the time for it , " the preacher told him.  |p228They  talked for a while in the barn , staying away from the small specter in their minds . " How is he ? " Harry Donner had to come to it at last . Walter Bashore shook his head . " Doc says it ca n't be long now . He says it 's in the blood and nobody ever gets well from what he 's got . " Both men braced themselves when they came out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front porch waiting for them . The north wind over NippenoseMountain blew her skirt and hair . Harry Donner 's heartiness , so real and strong at the Harmons ' , felt slightly forced here . From Mrs. Bashore 's face he knew the questionsbefore they were asked . Why ? Why must it be an only child like Shelby , a bright mind and a good boy ? What had the Lord against a child who was n't old enough to have done anything bad ? She wrung his hand and they went in . The preacher spoke as warm and hearty with life as he could in these melancholy rooms . She motioned him to the stairs and he went up humming with a show of cheerfulness . The boy in the iron bed in the back room tried to sit up when he saw him at the door . " Am I going to die , Reverend ? " he called out piteously and fell back . The words were to haunt Harry Donner as long as he lived . It was warm up here , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The preacher pulled a chair close to the bed and took the small blue-veined hand.  | " No , Shelby , " he said . " None of us ever die . On Calvary the Lord said to the man on the cross next to him , Today thou shalt be with me in paradise . ' " " But they 'll put me in the ground ! " the boy cried . " No . " The preacher felt a stubborn rush of something in him . " Life can never be kept in the ground . It always comes out . Every seed rises . It 's God 's law . All of us are praying for you . I 'll pray for you before I go today and I 'll pray for you tonight before I go to bed , and I 'll pray for you tomorrowmorning before I get up . All things are possible to God . The Bible says so . Now let 's talk about life and living . " He told again about his trip to Brooklyn , about the trains and trolleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church he preached in , the East River and the ferries and the lights at night . When the boy came piteously back to his fear of the ground , the preacher told how good the ground was , soft and rich to the plow , that it stayed warm in winter and cool in summer , how the whole world depended on it and its fruit . It was time to go and yet the boy 's eyes begged him not to leave him . " But what if you 're punished ? " he cried . The preacher sighed . Here again was the bitter fruit of some of those inexplicable things in the Bible . He sat thinkingwhat he could say . " When I was a boy , " he began , " a little older than you , I lost my penny for Sunday school . All the way to the churchp230I prayed I 'd find it . But I did n't . It shamed me that I 'd have nothing for the collection . So I prayed harder . I promised the Lord that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it all in the collection . I 'd no more than promised that when I saw something lying by a buggy wheel . When I rooted it out of the dirt , it was a silver dollar . Well , now that I had the dollar , I changed my tune . I told myself the dollar must have been there all the time and I 'd have found it whether I 'd prayed or not . Besides , who ever heard of anybody in my class putting a dollar in the collection ? It would make the other boys feel cheap . So I ran down on Back Street where Pappy Haas kept his little store open on Sunday and had the dollar changed . I put a nickel in the collection and kept the rest in my pocket for candy and other things later on . " " Did n't God punish you ? " the boy wanted to know . " No , " Harry Donner said quietly . " In fact he was very good to me and later on he called me to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something to do with it . Of course , the rest of it was paid back long ago . " The boy lay back less troubled on his pillow . Harry Donnerasked for a Bible and opened it at the Ninety-first Psalm . He had read it aloud when the yellow cat that had been in the kitchen when he arrived came into the bedroom , peered up at the bed appraisingly , then sprang on it and made itself comfortable . " Did you ever notice , Reverend , " Mrs. Bashore said ,  | " how that cat comes when you read out of the Bible ? You 'd almost think it could understand . " The phrase " the power of the Word " ran through the preacher 's mind but he said nothing , only took a thoughtful and more sympathetic look at the cat before going on to the Twenty-third Psalm . Mrs. Bashore had long since lighted a lamp . Now she asked that he sing a hymn for Shelby before he went , but he put her off . To an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young boy frightened of death it might be otherwise . He remembered how as a boy he had been depressedby certain hymns long after his sister Bessie 's funeral . It blinded him a little to come a half hour later into the big DeLong farmhouse bright with lights and gay smiling people . " Where were you , Reverend ? " they all reproached him . " You missed the dinner . " " I 'm sorry but I could n't get away , " he said simply . Mrs. DeLong , a big stout woman in lace , and much celebratedfor her cooking , gave him a sad look . " I wo n't soon forgive you , Reverend , " she said . " Dr. Metzgar had to say grace . But I kept something back for you . I hope you have n't had your supper . " " No , Mrs. DeLong , " he said . " I saved that for you . " It seemed , he thought , as he went around greeting every/one and later as he sat alone at the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished English china used only on very special occasions , with the candles burning , with lively talk and laughter from parlor and kitchen , with the ladies in silk dresses , with a pair of white gloves lying on the table and a glimpse of Mrs. Metzgar with a gay lacy shawl around her shoulders , that here in this house death , sorrow and suffering had been shut out . But when he put his forehead down to his hand for silent prayer , it all came back to him . For a moment or two he had been able to keep dark things from his mind . Now already they were upon him and he must plead to his Maker against them . Even after he raised his head and smilingly began to attackthe plate piled high with chicken , mashed potatoes , gravy and two or three vegetables , and after he declared how good everything was to Mrs. DeLong , who had served him and now stood by to keep watch over him , he kept seeing the old man and young boy in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other who wanted desperately to live and must die . It was hard to understand these things . He had heard some younger preachers speak as though once you were in the kingdom , an appointed servant of the Most High , all was made clear . It must be that he had only one foot in the kingdom , for despite what he fully believed and tried to perform , the mystery at times seemed only the greater and more inscrutable.  |p233On  the drive home Mamma kept talking about Mrs. DeLong'sdinner . It had been , she said , one of the nicest parties she had ever attended in the valley . She especially loved the Christmas decorations and favors , but was n't it a shame poor Dr. Metzgar had to be called out and missed most of the evening ? Papa agreed . In reality he hardly heard her . He was thinking how the holidays had always meant to him a jubilant and triumphant season . He had loved the Christmashymns and carols , abounding as they did in rich and splendid phrases such as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hark the herald angels , sing glory to the newborn king . " He had liked nothing better than to take his three sons out on a snowy Christmas Eve and sing joyous words and tunes into the frosty air . But this Advent the magnificent and exultant troubled him . There seemed to be too much misery in the world for glittering pageants and sumptuous celebration . Preaching about gifts of frankincense and myrrh meant little to poor farmers trying to raise a bit of Christmas money cutting a load of mine prop or lagging from their mountain timber , or to those who in good times drove a horse and buggy to and from woodworking jobs in Wetherill but were out of work today . For the time being God 's magnificent heaven lay pretty far away . A mild and humble Saviour stood much closer , one born in a stable , who had been a carpenter and footpath wanderer , who had said , " I am meek and lowly "  |p236and  " The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This Christmas he would devote his prayers and preaching to the lowly Jesus . For the season and an indeterminate time thereafter , the son of man rather than the prince of heaven would be his patron , the man of sorrows his intercessor.  |p237V  aleria Donner came up the hill from Paint Creek to Blacksher , a slow , tall , heavy woman at sixty , she who as a young married girl had been so active and slender , climbing trees and running up stairs . But she could take it better now , both the hill and the soft-coal towns at either end . All three had been a struggle when first she came . Wetherill Valley had been so green . In Paint Creek hardly a blade of grass grew . She had tried not to complain to Hal . Not a word that the two-thousand-foot elevation had shortened her breath , that the pains about her heart were sharper here or that she loathed the perpetual reek in the air . " It smells like the infernal regions , " she wrote Jess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the stones of the streams are painted with sulphur . " She felt most keenly the increased separation from Unionville , from Jess and even from Hal 's folks , who almost neverp238came to see them out here . The great mountains between them might have been oceans and she on the other side of the world . Most of those who passed on the street were foreignbornspeaking alien tongues , Slays , Poles , Italians , slight fierce Magyars with great handle-bar mustaches , and Greek Orthodox priests in their heavy fur coats and Russian Astrakhanhats , all breathing out vigorously in the frosty mountain air . The Johnstown trolley reeked of garlic . Somehow she had expected more Irish as in the hard-coal regions at home . The Irish she never considered foreign , having some of the blood herself . But for Hal , Paint Creek might have been New Jerusalem . He preached with enthusiasm , giving his drab congregationthe best of his Wetherill Valley sermons . The open welcome in his face was turned on one and all . His hearty greetings missed no one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile could not be misunderstood . He reported to her that Father Sukeena of St. George 's and FatherYanulevitch of St. Nicholas 's with the onion steeples were " fine fellows . " His fervor for life returned . When she called him to dinner he would sing out from upstairs , " I'se a-comin ' . " In their thirty years , Mamma thought she had heard such phrases repeated almost too often . But his pleased , almost idiotic grin when he used them was better than a long face , his favorite word " wonderful " better than complaint or gloom . The dinners he had had with parishioners were " wonderful . " He magnified " the faithful " at Thirty-two , a Companymine patch where he had started preaching Sunday afternoons , and he did the same to the scenery on his twomilewalk each way . If ever he wished for Pompy and the buggy , he never mentioned it . " Whew ! " he would pay tributeto below-zero readings and " My ! " to Mr. Jonas 's sugar maples standing tapped with kettles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your own sugar grove , he declared , although they had had a row of sugar maples untappedand unpraised at their late Manada Hill parsonage.  |p239Yet  , she told herself , she could never have lived here or in any other mining town without Hal . He was still mostly boy . " Did I put sugar in this ? " he 'd puzzle over his cup of coffee . " Dr. Evans does n't want me to use a whole lump . " He would break it in half , putting half in the cup , the other half in his mouth . More than once since here he had absent-mindedly addressed a letter to himself . " What in the world ! " he had cried in dismay when it was delivered . He still half expected to find in his mail some notice of a bequest from the stranded old woman to whom as a young man he had given money for a railroad ticket . She had taken down his name to " rememberin my will . " He had always given his best to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was dressed . " Oh , something green or blue , I ca n't remember which , " he 'd say . Mamma halted to rest her legs by the railroad , the border between the two counties . At first it had been something to write Jess about , the church in Cambria County and thep240parsonage in Somerset . It was n't much of a parsonage , just half of a double house , scarcely larger than a miner 's house , but if Hal could manage , she could . She must n't forget their blessings . Johnny had found a job on one of the Johnstown papers , and Gene paid board at home out of his wages on a mine surveying crew . They still had friends back east . Their Christmas cards from Wetherill Valley and Mahanoy , many of them postcards with holiday tinsel , made a high heartwarmingpile . Hal 's congregation had given him a handsomepurse and the minister 's wife a real fur piece . ChristmasEve the Welsh choir from Blacksher had serenaded the parsonage . Hal had gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a treat . Mr. Thomas , the leader , told her that Cambria was the ancient name of Wales , the land of the Cimbri or Cymry , and that if she visited Ebensburg , the county seat , she could hear Welsh spoken on the street . He invited her to come and see his wife when he would show her and the Reverend an open Welsh coal fire burning in the front room . That was very nice . But , oh , there was still something lonely and foreboding here , something she had never felt at Mahanoy , something depressing as the narrow bituminous veins where the miners had to crawl on their hands and knees . Hal himself must have felt it at first . Weeks afterwardTim had told her what his father had said to him when they first came . It was in Rob Wagner 's house , where they stayed until they could rent a house for the parsonage.  | " Do n't tell Mamma , " Papa had groaned . " But I have the blues . " If he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealedthem well enough . She herself had grown resigned to the place , but never would it be home.  |p242T  he preacher felt confounded when he first heard it . He was up in Blacksher making a pastoral call on Swedish Lutherans . He had n't been there long when Billy Potts , out of breath , was at the door . " They want you in Paint , " he said . " Jake Schneck 's killingeverybody . " " Who 's everybody , Billy ? " the preacher asked . " Well , he shot Tom Staller . Maybe more till you get there . " " You must be mistaken , Billy , " the preacher said . " No , Reverend . Steve Kushko sent for the state police , and Lily Maddis told me to get you . Your missus told me where you were . " " Well , I 'll come right away , " the preacher said but he still could n't believe it . All the way down the hill he declared the presence of God against Billy 's babbling . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are in death " and that " as for man , his days are asp243grass . " But Tom Stadler was Jake 's best friend , his crony . Furthermore Jake was a mild man especially fond of childrenand babies . Only last week the preacher had seen him , fresh from the mines , coming down Back Street , a short stocky , almost fat Dutchman waddling a little as he walked , his tin dinner bucket in his hand , stopping at every porch in his block that had young life on it . You might think a child would scare at a heavy face black with coal dirt , white of eyes and broadly pink of lip , but Paint Creek babies were used to black faces . Also , Jake had a way with the very young that no one who did n't understand that side of a Dutchman would suspect . They grinned back at his pantomimesand gurgled at his roughhousing . And now he was supposed to have done murder to his best friend . Harry Donner could n't believe it . But something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they got to Paint Creek , people out on their front porches and talking in groups told him the worst . When he turned down Back Street he could see everyone in the street except in front of Jake 's house , where it was conspicuouslyvacant . " Watch out , Reverend ! " the women called as he went by , and he felt suddenly and strangely exposed as he crossed the naked spot in front of Jake Schneck 's house . Steve Kushko , the constable , and half a dozen others were waiting just inside Jake 's door . Jake 's daughter , Lily Maddis , threw herself on him and poured out a wild stream ,  |p244only  half of which her pastor comprehended or gave credenceto . He knew that ever since the Schneck girls had married , there had been trouble in this house . Jake had finally moved up on the garret where he had his bed , " like when I was a boy at the tipple , " he told the preacher . Today the mines had n't worked , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home together , and that was its great misfortune . " He fought with Lute and Wilmer all morning , " Lily told him . " Then he said he was going up to his room ' and none of us would ever see him again . " " Lil tried to go up and talk him out of it , " Stella cried . " He told her he 'd kill anybody who laid foot on the garret stairs . " " So we got Tom to come and talk to him , " Lily went on . " If anybody could do anything with him we thought it would be Tom . He told Tom the same as he told me , what he 'd do . But Tom never thought it meant him . They were always such buddies . He kept going up , pleading with Pop to put his gun away , and Pop killed him . " She said it hysterically , covering her face with her hands . " We heard another shot , " Stella said . " We thought he 'd killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't dead yet and would kill the first person on the garret stairs . " Harry Donner groaned to himself . The Lord 's wordsp245came to him , " Oh , faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I suffer you ? " He made a move for the stairs but they rushed in front and held him back . " He 'd kill you , too , Reverend ! " they cried . " Do n't worry that I should ever tempt him or any other man , God willing . I just want to get his leave to look at Tom and see if he 's still alive so we can get a doctor . " " Tom 's laying on the garret landing , Reverend , " Steve told him . " I could n't see that he moved a finger after Jake blasted him . I would n't give him the chance to do that to you. , , The preacher shook them off . It felt strangely quiet now in the house , almost peaceful upstairs . Here he was close to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an illusion , something that could n't be . He had noticed this sense in him before , an inability to credit evil . The upstairs hall was like a box . An overwhelming sense of pity came over him for the three men and two women who had tried to live together in this tiny house . There was really no garret stair landing , only a spread where the steps turned . He could see Tom Staller 's poor head and arms hanging down over the steps and the garret door open beyond . " Who 's that ? " a terrible voice called . " It 's me , Reverend Donner , Jake , " the preacher said . " Did they tell you what I said I 'd do to any man who tried to set foot on these stairs ? "  | " Yes , they told me what you said . And that 's where you committed your great sin , Jake . " " Sin , Reverend ! " he shouted . " It 's them . They 're the ones who done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , holed me up like a rabbit in a stone pile . Then they made me get my gun in self-defense . " " Your greatest sin , Jake , was not with your gun but with your mouth . " The unseen man seemed startled , was still for a moment thinking that over . " My mouth did no sin , Reverend . It only warned them what they 'd make me do . If they 'd had sense , they 'd a lis-tened . " " You know what Scripture tells us  --  that the tongue , not the hand , is the most dangerous member ? James called the tongue a fire and a world of iniquity , that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature . ' " " I did n't defile anybody , Reverend . They defiled me . They 've been defiling me ever since they moved in under my roof . " " You did worse , Jake , " the preacher said relentlessly . " Do n't you know your own flesh  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , the flesh says you must keep it . No matter the consequence . You knew this and yet you let your anger make the vow that you 'd kill anyone who came up these garret steps . Once you said it , you were done for . That was your mortal sin . "  | " It was theirs for trying to come up , Reverend ! " he shouted . " They know I never broke my word . " " There are plenty of times when it should be broken , Jake . Yours and mine , too . In heathen times the king Agamemnonvowed to sacrifice the most beautiful thing in his possession , which turned out to be his daughter Iphigenia . But Diana released him . She snatched Iphigenia away and put a stag in her place . And our own God sent an angel to release Abraham before he sacrificed Isaac . God would have released you , too , from your vow if you 'd have got down on your knees and asked him before you took the life of your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from the garret . " Why did n't you tell me this before , Reverend ? " Yes , why had n't he ? the preacher groaned to himself . Oh , he could muster excuse and self-defense . Why had n't Jake sent for him ? Jake was like those parishioners who sent for the doctor but expected their preacher to come without word or call . But this was no time for self-justification . It hit too close to home . How could he forget his own willful tearing up of roots in Wetherill Valley , the sad resignation in Mamma'sface , the hurt eyes of those he deserted ? He had put on a great show of enthusiasm out here , had thrown himself with zeal into his work , but he would have given a great deal had he stayed and endured . After all , there had been only one thorn in his flesh in Wetherill Valley , not a whole crown of them as his Lord had borne.  |p248The  Mountain in the West " Yes , why did n't I , Jake ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You , Reverend ? " in astonishment . " It 's true , Jake , " he went on bitterly . " I lost my temper like you . This was in another charge . I vowed in my sermon I 'd leave . I 'd rather have stayed . I wanted to stay and there were many who needed me . But I 'd given my word . God would have released me if I 'd have asked . I should n't have cared what anybody thought . But I was vain and proud of my word in front of other people , like you were , Jake . " There was a long silence from the garret broken by sounds of hard breathing . " Do you want to come up now , Reverend ? I got to get to the outhouse . And if any son of a bitch tries to stop me  --  " " Nobody will try to stop us , Jake , " the preacher reprovedhim and started up the stairs . He knelt first by Tom Staller , put his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little moaned prayer he lifted the heavy body down to the hall floor . Then sighing , he climbed through the garret door and sighed no more . He had seen hard sights before , miners crushed by a fall of rock , a child fallen into the thresher and the pitiful eyes of the dyingbegging for just a spoonful of life . But he was unpreparedfor this , a man he did n't know , just the carcass of a man sitting on the garret floor , his back against the iron bed , a gun in his thick hand , and blood and flesh all over him , soaking the bed behind him , blackening his shirt and pants ,  |p249standing  in pools on the floor . Part of his head had been shot away . Now he struggled to get to his feet as the preacher appeared . " Sit still , Jake . You ca n't go down this way , " he told him . " The hell I ca n't , Reverend . " " Wait , I 'll get you a bucket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take care of myselfonce I get there . " " There 's a crowd down there , Jake . " " Are you helping me down , Reverend , or do I go my-self ? " " I 'll help you then , Jake , " the preacher promised . " But you 'll have to leave your gun up here . And you 'll have to do something for the Lord . " " What 's that ? " " Contain yourself to your girls and sons-in-law and everybody else . No matter what they say to you . Hold your tongue even if they crucify you . You failed to do that before . Now show the Lord you can do it . " Jake 's blue eyes grew stormy and profane but he let Harry Donner take the gun and pull him to his feet . The man would never make it , the preacher told himself . It was a rank impossibility . Afterward he hardly remembered how he got him down the stairs , only the trail of blood behind them , the bloody smears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , first in the house , thenp250from neighboring backyards as they went down the boardwalk . All the way the preacher could feel a terrible seething in the human wreck he half supported , half carried . " Go way ! " Harry Donner told them sternly in the backyard . " Leave this dying man in peace . " But they hung about like flies on flypaper , closing in on the outhouse as they entered . The rest he tried to forget . He almost wished these foolish people could have been crowded in there with him , to know the depths of degradation to which their unruly tongues could drag them , to taste to the fullest their own capacity for depravity and wickedness . When the preacher came out alone , Al Weaver told him afterward , he looked like a bloody corpse himself . " Is it safe to go in after him ? " Steve Kushko asked , suddenlytaken with his duty . " It 's safe , " the preacher told him . " You wo n't need the state police . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namingone of the two undertakers in Blacksher.  |p251The  preacher seldom gave a thought to his age . But last week he had had a birthday . Let 's see , how old was he anyway ? Sixty-four or - five . He had been born two years after Mamma . Why , that made him sixty-six ! Well , it did n't matter . He might have a few more pounds to carry up in the pulpit but he could still get around . He remembered where as a middler in the seminary he had walked on his thirtyeighthbirthday . He had to preach at a schoolhouse across the river . It meant tramping the mile-long railroad bridge , then more miles up a succession of hills . The schoolhouse stood on the very top , and when he climbed the last ridge with the sun setting in the golden river , he had sung half aloud , half to himself , the hymn ever afterward associated with the time and place . The streets , I am toldAre paved with pure gold . And the sun , it will never go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , exceptthose of his mother . They had been born almost on the same day . Of late years he liked to take the Sunday nearest her anniversary to preach on Motherhood . The sermons were all different , or so he thought , except , of course , some of the familiar phrases such as " Of all the names in the world , the sweetest name is Mother . " When he brought in incidents about her , he often had to wipe his eyes . The boys used to criticize these sermons . They said he was too personaland sentimental . He could n't agree and would n't change a line . He felt that what he wanted to say was a kind of public testimony to the small dark Welsh woman he could no longer say it to in person . This year he had thought his " discourse " a little better than usual and had taken a pencil-written manuscript to the Blacksher Era . He did n't know if it would be reprinted or not , and a pleasant feeling ran over him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . But he was startled to find that the paper called him " the elderly preacher . " The phrase shook him and kept coming back to his mind . It carried disturbing meanings . Why , his work had hardly begun , and now they hinted that it was nearing its end . What had he done with his life anyway ? The Lord had said , " Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every livingcreature . " So far he had gone into little more than four or five places to preach ; Bairdsville , Mahanoy , Lost Run , Wetherill Valley and Paint Creek . The Lord had said ,  | " Work for the night is coming when no man worketh , " and now the Era hinted that the dark cycle referred to was close at hand . He had always hoped to do something worth while for the Lord , something more than the small white church he had built at Lost Run or the brick one he had finished at Manada Hill , some holy shrine he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance like Claude Mersey 's in Brooklyn or the cathedral in Philadelphia he had once enteredwith awe . Had he started too late and was this now , so far as he was concerned , never to be ? Perhaps , he thought , he could still do it if the Lord gave him more time for bigger things . So many little daily duties came up , like the obligation put on him by Ralph Mace , a miner at Thirty-four and not even a member of his church . He said he wished the Reverend could go and see his mother . She was old and failing and had told her son she had n't tasted the Lord 's bread or wine in thirty years . " I 'll certainly visit her and give her communion if she wants , " the preacher had promised . " Where can I find her ? " " Chadd 's Cove . They ai n't had a Lutheran preacher in there since she came over the mountain . " Harry Donner had heard only dimly of Chadd 's Cove . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down her name in his little black book so it would n't escape him as names of late were prone to do . Next time he talked to Claude Barefoot , he told about the poor woman , hoping his councilman would offer to take himp254in his automobile , the only " machine " in his church . Indeed there were but three in Paint Creek and very few more itY Blacksher . But the hardware dealer discouraged him . No fit road existed over the mountain to Chadd 's Cove . The only decent road ran from the other end of the cove , and you had to go nearly to Bedford to get on it . Besides , the Cove had a bad name . Cove people , he said , were a poor lot who had come in early and killed off the Indians . When there were no more Indians to fight , they had fought among themselves . There had been three murders in his time and none of the men , so far as he knew , had ever been brought to justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all related , " Claude said . " If it had coal in there , they might have got civilized . As it is , they 're still heathen . If you went in , Reverend , you might never get out . " The preacher 's heart leaped at the words , exaggerated as he felt they must be . He thought how Peter and Paul had gone into dangerous places among the heathen . " I 'll have to walk it then , " he said heartily . " It 's too far , Reverend , " the hardware dealer protested . " I could take you to the top of the mountain and you could walk down if you wanted to , but it has no telephone in the Cove . How could you get back ? " " If the Lord takes me down , he 'll bring me back , Claude , " the preacher said cheerfully . " I 'll be a thousandfold obliged to you for taking me part way . " It looked like rain when he left but nothing could stop himp256on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did n't get back that night . He had cautioned Claude to say nothing adverse about Chadd 's Cove to Mamma or to anyone who might tell her . Gloomily the hardware dealer drove him over the forested Allegheny plateau to a lesser road which he followed to the juncture of what looked like an abandoned logging road . " You know the kind of place it is down there , Reverend , when they do n't even have a road sign , " he said . With his passenger out of the car , the driver seemed unwilling to go . " I hope I do n't get in trouble for leaving you way out here , Reverend . " He backed around slowly , stopped again , then drove regretfully away . Once all sight and sound of his friend and car had vanished , the lonely remoteness of the place came over Harry Donner . He tramped on with energy but the only sign of life was what he thought at first an ax chopping in the deep woods but which presently grew far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost or some giant woodpecker of the woods . Although midmorning , it had grown darker now , especially under the pines . He came to a fork in the narrow road and afterward felt unsure whether he had chosen the right branch . Reaching in his pocket to see if he had set down directions , his small red Testamentgave his hand a feeling of protection , his Ministerial Acts a sense of anointment in the wilderness , feelings that had never come to him so strong in town or along the famil/iar roads of Broad Mountain . Had the Gospel , he wondered , grown richer and stronger also to Paul in dangerous places ? The phrase " shield and buckler , " so familiar in the Old Testament , suddenly grew clear . He went on feeling calmer . Soon afterward the road began to descend , at first moderately , then steeply over imbedded granite boulders that would have been impassable to Claude Barefoot 's " machine " and difficult for a wagon . Almost at once he rounded a bald knob and saw far below him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them with blue smoke risingfrom clay chimneys . He told himself he had never come upon any sight more welcome . The sounds of barking dogs and of a bawling cow rising from the depths sounded sweet to his ear . He could hear shouts of men calling to each other from a great distance , perhaps from mountain to mountain . There was somethingwild and primitive in the deep halloos , and he sobered a little at the sound , then brightened happily . These were truly the heathen the Lord had given him . His reception at the first house confirmed his notion . At the sight of him boys dove into the nearest bushes refusing to come out . Dogs barked savagely while a man and woman watching from the door remained closemouthed to his greetingand questions . After all , he reminded himself happily , he had n't been bitten , and he went on to a plank bridge sunken in the center where an old man listened to him withp259half-averted face , finally asking which Mace he wanted . It seemed that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mace , and when the visitor did find the right house , a plastered log cabin hanging to the side of the hill , it took patience and persistence to get in . All through his visit the old woman appeared suspicious of him and the bread and wine he had brought in his pocket . He told Mamma afterward that he had never given communion where it had " gone so uphill . " Noon passed and she did not ask him to dinner or get anything for herself . Perhaps she had only a mite in the house , he concluded , and unfortunatelyhe was not Elisha to multiply it . In the end , tired , his missionary enthusiasm thinned to a trickle , he said a fervent prayer for her and left for the long tramp home . It had started to rain and before he came again to the sunken bridge he stopped for shelter at a two-story log house near the road . Two hounds grew absolutely frenzied as he opened the gate and knocked on the door . A preternaturally lean man whose bony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs into the road . Then he turned to the stranger in sharp silence . " A fine rain ! " the preacher said , beaming , and stepped into the house . He glimpsed a woman and three half-grown girls in the doorway to the kitchen , greeting them with warmth and pleasure . Dark red streaked his host 's face as if the caller hadp260broken some unwritten law , making advances toward his women . " Where 'd you come from ? " he wanted to know . " Paint Creek , " the preacher answered benevolently . " I really live in Blacksher but my charge is in Paint Creek . " " You looking for coal ? " Evidently the word " charge " meant nothing to him . " Coal ? No indeed . I came to give communion to one of your neighbors . " " Communion ? What 's that ? " The Cove man looked suspicious . " Communion ? " A feeling of mixed pity and joy ran through Harry Donner , pity for ignorance of the sacred sacrament in this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this door . " It 's administering the body and blood of our Lord , given for the remission of sins , " he explained . The man and four womenfolk stared back uncomprehendingly . " What do you follow for a living ? " " I 'm a preacher of the Gospel . " The man looked at his womenfolk and back to his visitor . " What do you do regular ? " " I do that regularly , " Harry Donner assured him . " Sundaysand weekdays , year in and year out . " His host digested this . " Kin you preach any place or must you have a church to preach in ? "  | " Oh , anywhere , " he said . " In a church . In a schoolhouse . In the open air . I 've even preached in a barn . " " They was a preacher come in here six or eight years back , but he worked at farming and just did it on the side . Could you preach in my house ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It came to him that he might base his discourse on Man 's Hunger for God , first bringing in by way of illustration the hunger of man for material things like food . It might produce something for the inner man before setting back over the mountain . " Wait a minute . My woman wants to say something . " The man crossed the room and conferred with her at the kitchen door . " She says she 'd like Al and Fay to hear your preaching . That 's her folks . She says maybe we could give you a bed tonight and you could do your preaching this eve-ning . " " I 'd be glad to , " Harry Donner said , pleased , also aware that his heathen had suddenly been watered down , that he was not now to be honored with persecution and hardship , let alone imprisoned like Peter and Paul . He needed time to think this over to decide whether he had been blessed or whether love and its chastening had passed him by . But once the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shyly as they went in and out , he was content . And when the fragrance of frying potatoes and ham began driftingthrough the house he felt the invisible wreaths of grace about him . They all sat up to the kitchen table with a hugep260round loaf of bread together with a coffeepot , almost as large , at the wife 's hand . The host passed the platter of ham to the guest first . Harry Donner set it down without taking any . " Shall we pray ? " he asked , smiling around the table his pre-supplication smile , full of good will and yet touched with a certain mysticism as if the inner part of him had alreadywithdrawn and engaged in devotions with the Unseen . He put his elbow to the table , his forehead to his hand , sighed deeply and went into one of his most fervent and unstintedtable prayers , giving thanks first for old Mrs. Mace , whose spiritual need had drawn him to the Cove , for the son who had invoked it , for himself that he had been led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodly " house , for his welcome by the host and his " good wife " and by " the sightly daughtersgrowing up like Ruth among the corn " and finally for " all the manifold blessings " not the least of which were " these gifts prepared by kind hands . " When he finished and came back to reality he was conscious of those around the table looking at each other and then at him in a kind of hush and bewilderment as if a bearer of gifts in the guise of a poor missionary had come to sit down and break bread with them in their house . That night when he lay on his straw tick , he gave thanks for a noteworthy day . This , he mused , was the pure and primitive reception the early Christian propagators of the faith must have found . It was among those living in ignorance of God 's word , he reflected , that the261most honest and childlike response came . This entire family , like the household of Stephanas , had become candidates for baptism in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching , still growling a little when he stepped out of the house . He was on his way up the mountain next morning rejoicingin sunshine after the rain when someone on horseback overtook him , a short burly man with an unshaven face . " Good morning . A wonderful morning , " Harry Donner greeted cheerfully and stood aside to let him by , but the rider had stopped threateningly . " You the preacher that said things about me last night ? " " About you , my friend ? Not that I recall . " " Do n't you go lying to me ! They say you blackened and tarnished me and my woman 's good name . Did n't you say stuff about Dave and Sheba last night ? " " Why , yes , that 's right . I think I did mention David and Bathsheba . " " You just said Bathsheba to cover over . Everybody knows you meant my woman , Sheba . You claimed we lived in sin . You told it in front of everybody . It 's all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and not get beat up . " He got down from the saddle . The preacher kept a straight face . " I think there 's been a mistake , Mr.  --  " " My name 's Dave Mace . " " I 'm afraid it 's a case of mistaken identity , Mr. Mace.  |p262The  man and woman I referred to lived two thousand years ago on the other side of the world , in Palestine . They had nothing to do with you and your good wife . " " You said our names . " " It happens that you have the same names , at least in part . But I 'm sure you and your good wife have n't been living in sin . " " No , we just ai n't got down to Bedford to get married yet . " The preacher nodded gravely as though it was the most natural thing in the world . " Well , that 's easily remedied . Any time you decide on holy matrimony , I 'll read the marriage service over you and pronounce you man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " distrustfully . " Whatever you choose to give . Nothing at all if you ca n't afford it . " " I do n't want any cheap , piddling , second-rate marrying ! " Dave Mace declared . " No , of course not . It would be a complete , orthodox , religiousceremony . " " It would ! When could you do it ? " " Whenever I get to Chadd 's Cove again . " " And it wo n't cost nothing ? " " Not so far as I 'm concerned . There 's a state law that requiresa marriage license . You 'd have to go to the courthouseto get it . It will cost you a dollar . "  |p263The  man 's face fell . " You mean I got to pay to get married to my own woman ? That 's agin my principles . " The preacher studied the heavy face for a moment . " It 's not against mine , " he said . " Have you any chil-dren ? " " Three , and one on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and your wife have the status and rights of wedlock . You know what David , the man you were named after , said , Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thy house ; thy children like olive plants around thy table . ' You owe them the dignity and protectionof lawful marriage . " He took out a thin pocketbook and from it a thinner paper dollar . He went on . " But you 'll have to go down to Bedford and get the licenseyourselves . You and your wife . You might do that the first chance you get so I can tie the knot next time I come over . " The Cove man looked a bit dazed as he took the bill . He roused suddenly . " Git up in the saddle , preacher . My nag 'll pack ye up the mountain ! " All the way to Blacksher Harry Donner felt warmed by a certain overdue recompense . His failure long ago to persuadeDan and Dolly Singer to the authority of church and state had at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but glowing . For nearly an hour he sat at the kitchen table telling Mamma about Chadd 's Cove . His face shone . He had new work , his life a new lease . It was a great privilege , he told her , to minister to those deprived of the Gospel . He could forget now that the Era had called him " the elderly preacher . " His long tramp over the mountain had repudiated it . But Mamma said she wished the boys were still at home so one of them could go along with him when he walked so far . He found himself talking now of Cove people more than his regular charge at Paint Creek . A sense of urgency seemed to possess him , as if he had n't much time . He had four marriages the first several months and ran out of baptismal certificates so that he had to take the trolley to Johnstown for more . What helped him , he told Mamma , was the snake that had stuck its head out of the log wall in the schoolhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent 's brow . " A long mountaineer had stood up and crushed it with the stove raker . It was a cool day and the preacher believed the fire and warmth had drawn the snake out , but Chadd 's Cove peoplesaid , " Your sarment done it , Reverend . " They never tired of reciting the text or of retelling the story . It gave him a reputation far and wide in the mountains . Before the year was out he had formed a Cove church council . The men , he told Mamma , had already begun to fell timber for a church home . Fine men , wonderful men , hep265told her . She was never to see the church of Chadd 's Cove , except through Hal 's eyes , in which Cove , church and people shone with an aura of goodness and splendor . It was a little shock when two rough , seedy and almost degeneratelookingmen who said they were from Chadd 's Cove , stopped to ask for Hal and to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment later to hold in her hand a snapshot of the rude log building , not quite plumb , something like a sprawling schoolhouse in the wilderness , with its rough belfry and the bell that Hal had begged from a Somerset County farmer 's summer kitchen . But you would have never known its limitations from Hal . He went about with fervor and enthusiasm . He persuadedDr . Madenford of Trinity in Johnstown to preach the dedicatory sermon , and Claude Barefoot to drive them some sixty miles around by Bedford and Kerry Mills . BeforeEaster he dug into his own pocket for some of the Cove mothers to buy goods for their own and their girls ' confirmationdresses . It was a day of the Lord 's bounty , he told Mamma . Some folks he had never seen before came down out of the hills to Easter services on the Sunday after Easter . Old Wilmot Mace , who they said had murdered a cousin , was on a back bench . The young folks had brought in armfuls of shad branches from the mountain . The pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew warm and a bumblebee came from somewhereout of the logs and crawled over the white cloth andp266plate of bread . Jim Mace carried it out in his hand . He said it was white-headed and could n't sting . During communion , Tod Mace 's little girl followed him up to the altar . Her father threatened her if she did n't go back . " Let her stay , Tod , " the preacher said . " The Lord expresslysuffered such as her not to be turned away . " Tod did n't like it but let her squeeze between him and his wife at the peeled pine-pole altar . When the bread was passed , the preacher gave her a piece , which the child chewed gravely and with as much sense seemingly as her elders . Later he gave her the goblet of wine , taking care that she did n't more than touch it with her lips . It was a wonderful service , he told Mamma . Only the singing left something to be desired . They had no organ as yet and Cove people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself sang as strong as he could but he kept wishing for a good woman 's voice to lead them . Several had told him of Emily Mace , who both played the organ and sang  --  like a bird , they said . Her father , Mahlon Mace , kept store at the lower end of the valley . " You could hear her clean across the Cove , " they said . " But she ran off with a Raystown Branch man Mahlon had no use for and forbid her to see . So he cut her out of his will and he told her never to cross his doorsill again . She wo n't get nothing out of him when he dies . " The preacher tried to talk the matter over with Mahlon , but Emily 's " disloyalty " was one thing the storekeeperp267would n't talk about . Outside of that , Harry Donner told Mamma , summer in the Cove had glorified God and gladdenedthe heart of man . Farmers plowed up " extry " land , including some new ground , to give its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , bringing heat and rain at just the right season to fill out the grain . Harry Donner did have what he called " a spell in his leg . " It came on him climbing back over the mountain in August . Dr. Evans called it a slight stroke but told Mamma not to tell him . It left in time for Harvest Home services . This was the service Cove men took to more than any other church day of the year . They filled up everything behind the altar rail with corn shocks and pumpkins , red apples and rusty pears , sheaves of wheat , oats and buckwheat . They especially brought the longest ears of corn they could find in the field and fixed them hanging down with their husks shucked back . The preacher could hardly make his way up in the pulpit . He told Mamma he felt like St. Francis in the bush preaching to the birds . All that fall he brought home the fruit of Cove men 's rifles , bloody furred rabbits , limp squirrels and a wild turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mahlon Mace died in front of his store lifting a hogshead of molasses off the wagon . Cove folks said his death was a Christmas present to his boy , Sam , who would take over the store , and to his girl , Ruby , who with her husband would get the farm . His other girl , Emily , came on horseback , taking a short cut over Maunders Ridgep268to the funeral , for her father could n't keep her out of the house now . She said she just had time , when she heard it , to make the burying . " A fine-looking woman , " Papa told Mamma later . All through the funeral service in the house she sat without a tear alongside her brother and sister inheritors , and everybodywatching to see how she 'd take it . She walked along with the family to the graveyard and came back to hear the will read although she must have known what the words would say . This was what Harry Donner hated most , for the preacher had to read it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to the part disinheriting her and pouring out old Mahlon 's bitterness for what she had done . When he finished , the preacher wanted to tell her how he had tried but failed to soften her father , but she gave him no chance . Rising , she startled them by going to the old parlor organ and seating herself on the stool . Her strong feet worked the pedals while her chapped hands lay on the keys she used to know . Then in a pure clear voice strong with feeling she started singing an old song , accompanying herself as she went . Mid pleasures and palaces Though we might roam , Be it ever so humbleThere 's no place like home.  |p269Harry  Donner 's HeathenA charm from the skies Seems to hallow it there Which , seek through the world , Is not met with elsewhere . Home , Home . Home , sweet home . There 's no place like home . There 's no place like home . She sang one verse and chorus . Then she got up and left . Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rode off the way she had come , with snow flurries in the dark woods and with the darker mountain and sky overhead . He was never actually to see her again but often on the road to and from the Cove he kept hearing in his mind her rich untrained voice and seeing her still down there somewhere in the deep mountain gulf going back empty-handed to her house and children.  |p270Valeria  Donner lay , a long , gaunt , gentle body in her bed . Through the open window she could see smoke rising from Thirty-four across the valley . Sometimes she thought she heard the loaded mine wagons rumbling out of the drift and the faint thunder of unloaded coal at the tipple . Hal was over there this afternoon marrying a Slovak couple in the patch . The preacher 's wife doubted she would ever see Thirtyfourat close hand again . If she had n't known it , the way Mrs. Petchullis acted would have told her . Every now and then she came to see if the sick woman was all right . The latter would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belatedhusband tiptoeing up at night , then see her round foreign face at the doorjamb . " I come in case you want anything , " she would say defensivelybut it did n't explain the fearful expectancy in her eyes.  |p271Oh  , why did they go to so much trouble trying to conceal the truth from her ? Hal did it better than Mrs. Petchullis and Dr. Evans better than Hal . He was such a nice , fastidious little Welshman who explained how the half dozen kinds of pills and bitter liquids he left with her would make her a new woman . He and she used to joke about how young and beautiful she would be then , although both knew very well in their hearts it could never be . Valeria Donner did n't so much mind dying . She had lived longer now than she had ever expected . Also , when you 've been a lively girl mentally and physically , loving social life , able to dance and walk for miles and then gradually have your license in life and activity curtailed until a monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even considerate eventuality . She marveled a little how something , so fearfuland unthinkable to her as a girl and as a young mother with three small boys to raise , could finally to an old , weak and defenseless woman seem harmless and mild . What troubled her most was n't her passing but spending her last precious drops of life so far from home and family among alien folk in an alien land . There were always people in Hal 's charges she loved . But as a whole , his chosen people were not hers , especially out here . She agreed that heaven was made for them as much and perhaps more than for those with the sin of discrimination , but she could n't help that she had grown up familiar to a different order , not so much the rank and file of her father 's congregation asp272some other families of town , Lutheran , Methodist and Reformed , that her people moved with or were related to by distantblood or marriage . Nearly all were dead now but still alive in her mind  --  Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl of twelve and tell how he had wanted to marry her mother  --  General Acgrigg , who built the railroad to bring down coal to the canal from the collieries  --  the Ammons , Major and Squire , who were Uncle Gus and Uncle Ed , and their wives Aunt Doty and Aunt Mary although the relationshipwas difficult to explain  --  and the Markies , who like the Ammons had " libraries " with red leather chairs and couch : Dan 's , where you were warned not to go without a companion , Lib 's , where you could safely go alone , and Max 's , whose girls , Sade and Annie , had such gorgeous voices . She had tried to be one with Hal 's church people , his " salt of the earth , " the rough and kindly who loved his sayingsand Christmas jingles . But she felt in her heart that she had really never been accepted or successful . She had found , if she had n't known it before , that the humble orders have their own exclusions and discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to die in Johnny and Henrietta 's house on their place back near the Susquehanna , or in Gene and Ellen 's hospitable brick house in the suburbs of Reading , or in Timmy and Anne 's white clapboard house in the large college townp273where Anne was active in her alumni . But she did n't want to be any trouble . Out here she could manage to depart just as surely . Death was no respecter of places . Thank goodness that Hal was used to people dying and their funerals . She consoled herself that it would be harder on the boys . She had thanked the Lord all her life that she had good boys . None of them had given her trouble . Or if they had , they made up for it now . Gene and Tim had positions with great corporations whose company names she loved to pronounceto anyone who inquired .

Church peoplecame to Hal with their troubles , but her three boys had always come to her . The last years it had been hard to live so far away . It would be harder still to leave them . She had once wished her third son had been a daughter . Was n't it sad now when she had three daughters and as many grandchildrenthat she would have to go away ? Of course , it would be hard to leave Hal , too . But there was a difference . Aunt Teresa used to say that blood was thicker than water . She wished she might have been a better pastor'swife . As a young woman , children would sit endlessly listening to her made-up stories , but she had n't the Christiancharity of Hal . He would walk ten miles to please a childp274or old woman , slave for hours with no pay or recompense but a smile . Jess liked to tell of the time when Polly had seen a quarter moon for the first time . " Oh , Mamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Uncle Hal 'll fix it . " Aunt Doty had another story . She claimed a miner 's wife from Lost Run had bought a pocketbook in the store with her last dollar . Hal had made the sale and then given the dollar back to the woman . " Now you 'll have something to put in it , " he told her . During the strike he had been unable to say no to starvingminers who left him with thousands in unpaid debts so that when he left the store business he could barely get out even . Without her father 's inheritance he could never have gone to college and seminary . Oh , Hal was a good man . But the wives of good men , she had found , had their trials . It seemed to her that goodness on occasion escaped from itself and became improvidence . She hoped that as a minister 's wife she was n't past praying for , but she had n't the pious immolation to follow the Lord 's injunction , " Give all thy goods to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a command especially when Hal more than once did just that to a needy and sometimes profligate soul at a time when they had little or nothing in the house . Her spirit was willing but the flesh weak . She still felt shock and rebellionthat he , who should have been a beneficiary , would head a church drive for money with an enthusiastic subscriptionp275of twenty-five dollars , a staggering sum to her . Where would so much money come from ? In the end she would manage to scrimp and save it , and they never starved , though she often sighed when Hal , as he was forever doing , brought people home for dinner and she had to use her last egg or slice of ham . Then there was the time they both needed new clothes . All winter and spring she had desperately wished for a good dress . Her shabbiness in church shamed her . She did n't see how as the pastor 's wife she could face Holy Week . Saturdaybefore Palm Sunday Hal had come home with a new clerical suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit , while she got into her split and rusty old silk . " My , but it feels good to know that you 're well dressed ! " he had told her as they crossed the road to church together . Now in another charge and another year , Valeria Donnerslept a little , dreaming she was a girl back in her father 's parsonage in Unionville . Such a good sense of security held over when she awoke , her feeling as a child that she and Jess and Peter were more fortunate than other children , blessed through their father and Uncles Timothy and Howard with a birthright that made them poor but royal relations of the King of Kings . Certain declarations in the Bible confirmed it in her mind , " Now are we the sons of God " and " I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness . " Of coursep276her father was more than a doorkeeper , rather an ambassadorof the Lord . Power and position not available to all flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him " and " Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed in the same image from glory to glory , even as by the spirit of the Lord . " She had n't known exactly what it meant , but it had given her a sense of vested participation in majesty and mystery . She had thought these things would support her all her earthly life , but they had faded , grown a little dusty and distant . Only at some unexpected moment as today did they light up the past as when on a late winter day the sun comes out and suddenly the countryside and mountains beyond are flooded with golden brightness . That was one great difference between Hal and herself , she thought . His call to preaching and title to heaven had never flagged . It still stood out in his eyes fresh and green as ever . In his sermons he liked to quote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no prophet ; neither was I a prophet 's son , but I was a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit . And the Lord took me as I followed the flock , and the Lord said unto me , Go prophesy to my people , Israel . " His passion for people had only intensified the last years . Some clergy she knew seemed mostly interested in the matter of souls , saving them , divesting them of their sins andp277stringing them up like dried rattlesnake buttons as a passportto heaven . Mortal man himself they seemed to think beneath them , unworthy , sinful , an animal carcass which without ecclesiastical reclamation would go to Gehenna . Hal , on the other hand , was devoted to man for his own sake . He admired most of the human race , doted on people as they were . He used to pray , " Grant that I may look all men in the face with the eye of a brother . " She had thought it a pity that none of his boys had taken after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed they were too much like herself . All her life she had shrunk from following the mendicancy of the Lord and his apostles that Hal so delighted in . " Neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses , nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes nor yet staves . " It was a disturbing , impossiblecommand to her . More than once in Wetherill Valley she had protested against staying at a farmhouse for dinner and making the tired wife prepare it . " You would deprive her of her gift to the Lord , " Hal had protested . " It 's something she can do for him . It 's not for us . " Just the same she noticed that he was the one who strove to pay for it with prayer , song and ministration . He seldom if ever refused a gift . Had n't Christ sent his disciples among the five thousand to ask for loaves and fishes , to a man in the city for a room for the Last Supper , and ahead on Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was true enough , but she and the boys were never comfortable in mendicancy . She remembered how he used to take them to Sharp 's Drugstore at Mahanoy and order five sodas , vanilla for her , chocolate , strawberry and nectar for the boys , and lemon phosphate for himself . All of them were aware it was not to be paid for . Hal would ask heartily how much he owed , and Mr. Sharp , a member of his congregation , would say , " That 's all right , Reverend , " whereupon Hal would warmly thank him as for a great blessing . On a summer Sunday when the evening sermon was delivered and the week 's work over , Hal used to send one of the boys for a quart of ice cream , but he almost never gave him the full price . " Ask for twenty cents ' worth , " he would say , and sure enough the quart box would come filled to the very brim . There was a ring at the doorbell . It could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . She could hear talking . After a time Mrs. Petchullis appeared . " Mrs. Weaver was here . She left a crumb pie , the kind the Reverend likes . She said she could n't come up now but she asked about you . " The preacher 's wife nodded . The Weavers were Hal 's intimates and admirers . " He always has so many cute things to say , " Mrs. Weaver once told her . " You know he never says , You 're welcome , ' but You 're welcome as the flowers in May . ' " The preacher 's wife stirred in her bed and sighed . Yes ,  |p279Hal  was a delight maker , particularly away from home . Hallelujahs came easy to him . He followed closely the admonitionto come before God 's presence with praise . She envied his ability to take things as God 's special and personaldispensation . " It was for me he hung upon the tree , " he would sing . " Ah , yes ! It was for me . " At that momentwhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his holy joy was very real . And when he sang , " Between that fair city and me , I can see , I can see , " she herself could for a moment glimpse through his eyes the city in the skies , four-square , cloud-encircled , amethyst and gold shimmering in the light of the Lamb . Still she wondered at times if she had done right in marryinghim . Another woman might have entered more wholeheartedlyinto his world . She remembered wryly how people in Unionville had said she would make an ideal minister 's wife . Some even whispered she had written her father 's sermonsand now could write Hal 's . As a matter of fact she had never really written a sermon for either , although she had made suggestions when asked , discreet suggestions , for a preacher 's daughter and wife must be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove . And now she would likely never have the chance to ask some anthropologist the meaning of Hal 's lips , especially his remarkable upper lip , a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or token and had it anything to do with the unusual essence of his being ? In all her life she had knownp280of only two whose lips were like his  --  an Asian general whose photograph had been in the newspapers , and a legendary doctor pictured on a bottle of medicine for women 's troubles . Had these men also , she pondered , been unworldly to such a degree ? Would they , for instance , do what Hal had done to her old violin in the attic ? Grandfather Scarlett had taken it from some unknown traveler on the Tulpehocken Trail who had n't paid his Mansion House board bill . It was bereft of strings but you could still see yourself in the back , so polished had it kept over the years . Hal , to please and providework for an old country cabinetmaker , had given it to him to overhaul , scrape and ruin . The only thing of hers she had never let out of her possessionhad been her mother 's cupboard . It stood downstairs now , scarred and dented by four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lamplight . Hal had to cut it down to get it into the low-ceiling house on Fighting Hill in Mahanoy . It had broken her heart and she promised herself that when her ship came in and they had regained position in some house with lofty chambers , she would have it restored to its former height and dignity . She had always felt her mother 's cupboard must have suffered as she had in these boxlike houses with low ceilings . Lately she realized that , Hal being as he was , what she had dreamed would never come to pass . But if Hal was impractical and almost helpless in some things , he was n't in prayer . That was where he suddenlyp281came into his own , took on stature , was able to take care of himself , become eloquent , persuasive , earnest and entreatingbeyond belief . She had seen more than one man and woman rise flushed and refreshed under his simple " I pray God 's richest blessing upon you . " He suited prayer to the occasion . On the Jewish Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy Saturday blessing , " as if it were different than that of other days . On New Year 's Day , his words " on this first day of the new year " were like squares of fresh bread kept sweet and holy for communion . The prayer she had thought about lately was his petition at the funeral of John Roberts , his old friend in Unionville . They had been called back for the occasion . Hal had spoken to God as he might have to his own earthly father sitting in the next room on the Morris chair with a gold scepter between his fingers instead of a cigar . " I commendto thy fatherly love and care one dear to me whom thou hast called out of the body to a higher life . Vouchsafe him light and rest , peace and refreshment , joy and consolationin the companionship of the Saints and in the encirclingfolds of thy great love . And if it be possible , may we be kept in communion in death as in life until reunited by the river . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , she was Vallie , his wife , and had been closer to him than a brother.  |p282T  he old preacher stood up under the blow valiantly . He gave himself what robust comfort he could . Mamma had been sick so long while he went everywhere on sound limb preaching , baptizing , marrying , visiting , ministering . Now the circumstances were to be reversed . He had to go about imprisoned in mortal clay while she was free to run up the hills of heaven . What was that verse from Isaiah ? " They shall mount up with wings as eagles . . . They shall walk and not faint . " At least while she lived she had had the best doctor in Blacksher , and Henrietta had brought her sister , Mary , a registered nurse , to take care of her at the end . Mamma had said how good she was to come , the first trained nurse she had ever had . She loved to see the starched white uniform and cap , to feel the cool skillful hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , grateful for every attention. - When it was all over , the old preacher tried to keep goingp283as before , staying away from the empty shell of parsonage as much as he could , devoting his time there to letters . His hand that had always circled so energetically above the paperbefore starting a new paragraph still did so , making vigorous and flourishing defense against " death and allobliviousenmity . " His letters were filled with a recital of his doings set down in his favorite words : " epistle " for letter ; " the Lord 's house " for church ; " tiptop " or " dandy " for well ; " a dear old saint " for some woman who had given him his dinner . He was unashamed to repeat phrases in letterafter letter . Most all declared , " I hope this finds you well and happy as it leaves me . " He kept writing , " I am truly grateful for my blessings " ; " for a goodly congregation on Sunday despite the inclement weather " ; " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up " ; " for being called on to offer a prayer " at some other minister 's service . If members of his church thought him too old , his letters never mentioned it . His only hint to Johnny was " I received a few digs . " Suddenly at seventy-five , writing about his church at Paint , he said , " I think some would like to see me out . I know a minister at eighty who holds on like dear life , and I suppose I could do the same , but I should not like such a sad thing to happen to yours truly . So before they try to pull me down off my horse , I 'm putting my feet on the ground . After all , I 've reached the allotted three score years and ten and am perhaps entitled to the golden rewards of retirement . "  |p284He  never cared much for those " golden rewards . " He went to see his boys , from each of whose homes he wrote copious letters of doings and descriptions , multigraphing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church members . Tiring of that , he went back to Paint Creek and adjoining Blacksher . " This , " he wrote Johnny , " is where I served the longest , where my friendships are greenest and the memories of your mother the freshest . " When Johnny paid back five hundred dollars he had desperatelyborrowed during the stock market crash , his father reported the purchase of an automobile , the first he had ever owned . Gene wrote that it was old and secondhand , painted a loud , ungodly green , and when his father visited him at Reading , the son was barely able to turn the wheel . But the old preacher could find no fault with it . He called it " the faithful chariot that carries me over hill and dale . " He wrote , " I am in good hands , have a snug and cozy sleepingchamber in the commodious Eureka Hotel managed by my friend , Vince McCarren . I have the honored place at the head of the table for regular guests , and you can depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room see to it that I 'm not slighted . " He reported plenty of companionshipin the hotel , which he called " a welcome haven for fine fellows in the sunset of life . " Johnny felt reassured by his father 's letters . He could n't remember the Eureka Hotel , and two or three years laterp185when he stopped off to see his father , was stricken with remorseto have left him here so long . The place turned out to be a dingy red brick pile with the close smells of ancient carpets , cooking , stale bed clothing and mortality , Vince McCarren , a gaunt grim man with a huge chin . What his father saw in him the younger man did n't know , or in the " fine fellowsin the sunset of life , " with all of whom he seemed to have closer ties of friendship than with the son himself . That evening in the " snug and cozy sleeping chamber " with his father , he peered with distress at the shabby furnishings . " You ca n't stay here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in affronted surprise . " Why ca n't I ? " " It 's not good enough for you . " " But I have my work here . " " What work ? " His father stiffened . " My ministerial work . I may be retired but I 'm not on the shelf . I supply Chadd 's Cove twice a month . You know Hadley at Paint wo n't go all the way down there every week . That is n't the only place . I supply all over Somerset and Cambria counties . I help out once in a while for Nicely at Johnstown . Then there 's certain sick people around here and the Cove that ask for me all the time . I have to go to see them no matter what Hadley thinks . They like me to pray and sing for them . Not every pastor can sing . "  | " They could do without you for a while , " Johnny said . His father 's face fell . " I suppose they could . But the men here at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front to you but they get pretty down in the mouth . One of them killed himself a few years ago , shot himself on the anniversary of his wife 's death . That was before I came . But I know how he felt . They tell me they 're no use to anybody any more . They have nothing to do , nobody to do anything for . They might as well be dead . They think their children send them money to keep them here just so they do n't need to have them at home . " Johnny winced , remembering his own monthly check to his father the last year or two . The latter went on . " I take a couple of them along in my car when I can . It does them good to get out . Some are Catholic and going to a Protestant church sticks in their craw , I suppose . But they 'll do anything for a change . Sometimes we 're asked to stay for dinner . That 's what they miss the most , getting into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You need a change yourself , Dad , " Johnny said . " Oh , I have plenty of change . Every day something happens . Only last week a girl got off the Johnstown bus and came in the hotel . She had a dear little baby . They gave her the room next to this . I was sitting here reading with my door open like I most always do when she came to the door and asked if I thought she could still get supper . I told herp187they only served at certain hours and the girls had gone home . But I said I had some prunes and oranges and a banana in my room , and I gave them to her . At first she told me the baby belonged to somebody else , but the next day she let me know different , which I knew all along . She said the man was married . She expected him to meet her at the bus but he had n't showed up . She said her home was in Florence and her people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ebensburg and put the baby in a home . I told her not to do that but go home and face the music and keep the baby but if she wanted to put it in a good place , I knew a God-fearing couple who were praying to adopt a child and it could n't get a better home . She said she 'd think about it but next day this man who 'd disappointed her at the bus showed up and took her away . I did n't know the fellow 's name and she did n't introduce me , but I helped her down with her things and gave him a look that told him he was doing this girl no good . I heard afterward she put the baby with a couple that some people I know did n't think too much of , but they paid her a good deal of money . " He talked all evening , mostly about local people . Whether they were important or obscure made little difference . He enlarged on one as much as the other . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about getting away with me for a while , Dad ? " Johnny urged him again . " Well , if you want to . I can drive you down to Gene 's andp288Ellen 's in my car . We can take some of my friends along . Two have never been to Gene 's and I 've promised to take them . " They left next morning in the old green sedan , his father rakish in a checkered cap , proud of his automobile , telling his two old friends where to sit and put their overnight bags . One was Mose Leopold , who had had a clothing store in Cairnbrook for many years ; and the other , Charley Adams , whom Vince McCarren called " the Hawaiian , " a massive , slow-moving , almost blind figure with a shock of iron-gray hair , who would suffer no man to help him . Yesterday he had kept bumping into chairs in the lobby and when he reached an empty one , had sunk in it defiantly , his face upturned , his eyes unseeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What such a person might get out of an automobile trip , Johnny did n't know , but today as if somehow bettered by the prospect , he made his way to the car without help or bumping . For dinner his father picked the best hotel in Bedford . Johnny paid for it as well as for several fat cigars which his father bought and distributed to his guests . From here on he let his son drive while the three smoked . When the cigars were thrown away , his father started to sing , a practicethat had always made Johnny uncomfortable , especially through towns . What was worse , his father induced the othersto join , and the sight and sound of these old codgers pealing out , " Singing Pollywolly doodle all the day , " mustp289have been something for the people who heard them coming and stopped to look and listen . They reached Gene 's in time for supper . To Johnny 's relief , Ellen did n't seem surprised or upset . Dad ushered the two guests up to their room , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard much but never seen , Ellen 's older sister paralyzed in childhood , long bedfast , twisted in face and body , able to speak only a kind of gibberish which Ellen , her children and Dad claimed to understand . He called her " my pal " in her hearing , which pleased her no end , and out of hearing , " that woman whom Satan hath bound lo these many years , " saying the latter with low anger that boded no good for Satan . It was late as usual when they went upstairs . " I think , Johnny , " he said as they got ready for bed , " you ought to go up to Unionville while you 're here . Mose and Charley can come along , and that 'll be one less meal for Ellen . " The son knew he meant the cemetery and Mamma 's grave . They drove up in the morning . The countryside lay still in the cool late-October sunlight . Many of the trees were bare but here and there a maple still burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun . The cemetery looked sad and deserted but his father led the way up the path erect and energetic . At the thick stone lettered " Valeria Morgan Donner " he relapsed into utter stillness for a few moments as he used to do on reaching thep290altar of his church on Sunday morning . Presently rousing , he pointed out the twelve or fourteen other graves on the double lot , telling things about each from Grandfather Scarlett down . That done , he conducted a tour of the cemetery , not forgetting the Donner lot and the graves of men and women he used to know , expanding with a kind of zest on one or the other , telling stories and laughing as if those who lay there unseen were still subject to the give and take of life . " Well , " he said at last , " I guess we better go clown to the DeWitt House and get something for the inner man . " As they started back to the car , they came on a flock of birds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall and now at the approach of the men flew up and circled overhead . Some came down again , but the main body of the flock circled higher and winged off for the south , soon mere specks against the sky until they disappeared over Shade Mountain . Johnny saw that his father had stopped to look after them with a strange wry expression at his mouth . As the three old men and one younger one went on , they flushed other birds from the flock which rose to take the exact course of their fellows as if guided by invisible markers in the air . Now only a few of the flock remained behind , and these seemed unquiet with their lot , reluctant to join their fellows , flitting from ground to bushes as if aware that the flock to which they belonged had migrated and with winter coming on they must go too , yet unwilling top291make the break , holding back in this temperate clime as long as possible before their long mysterious flight into the unknown . " You 'd wonder how they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , half aloud , half to himself , as he climbed into the car . He still , Johnny noticed , had the wry expression at the mouth , an expression the son was not to understand until years later he felt it on himself in the same cemetery at seventy.  |p292After  Johnny 's visit , his father wrote him longer letters than ever , six , eight , ten and once seventeen tablet pages , all handwritten , some in pen , some in blurred pencil . They catalogued a recital of doings , visits , social and church affairs , most of them accounts of people and of his own simple pleasures . There were also tragic , even sordid , accounts from life as seen firsthand from a pastor 's vantage . After some revealing incident and surprising personal observationson it , he nearly always concluded , " I confide this in the hope it may be grist for your mill . " The son felt his father anxious to convince him that he was not " on the shelf " but still engaged in active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Even when his letters , now much shorter and fewer , started coming from Gene 's address in Reading , his only complaintand confession was that he was " under the weather . " In answer to Johnny 's queries , Gene wrote , " He had pneu/monia . The doctor do n't know what 's the matter with him now . " Johnny , three thousand miles away , was n't too worried . Typhoid , the flu epidemic , heavy colds on the chest had never kept his father from something he wanted to do . A sudden wire from Gene that he better come if he wanted to see Dad alive shocked and sobered . Yet he remained strangely convinced that all was well . Gene met him at the train . " We still do n't know what 's the matter with him , " he told his brother . " When his fever cleared up , he wanted to stay in bed . You know Dad . You could hardly keep him in bed sick or well . Doc Hanneman did n't take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for observation . He wanted to find out why he did n't snap back . Since he was an old preacher , he could get him in for almost nothing . That 's the only way Dad would go  --  if it did n't cost us anything . He knew he did n't have the price and he did n't want us to have to foot the bill . " " He must have started feeling bad in Blacksher and that 's why he came . " " Did n't come for that at all , " Gene said . " Came to do a favor to some young preacher . Would n't talk much about it but I gathered enough . This fellow had been a boy in his church at Paint . Do you remember a Mimm boy ? Had yellow hair and glasses ? Dad confirmed him , encouraged him to go in the ministry . Went to bat for him in synod and got him help in college and seminary . Sent him money ofp294his own when he could . Not much , I guess . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . Some Johnstown church got vacant and Dad recommended him . They asked him out to preach a trial sermon . Of course , Dad went to hear him . He said he preached two wonderful sermons . But there was no train back till next day and this young preacher had a funeral , was anxious to get home . You know what happened ? " " I can guess , " Johnny said . " Dad offered to drive him home . " " Drove him over a hundred miles at night in that old car , " Gene nodded . " And Dad seventy-nine years old ! They must have got to this young Mimm 's place pretty late . It was raining . They 'd come through snow in the mountains . Dad would n't tell much . I had to get it out of him piecemeal and put it together . But when he got young Mimm home , I gather that the young preacher said much obliged , good night , and went in . At least I hope he said much obliged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . He probably left Dad standing there on the sidewalk by his car . You know how Dad was , always inviting people to stay with us . I 'm sure he thought he would get invited in for the night and breakfast . After all he had driven the guy a hundred miles to help him out and would have to drive another hundred miles to get back . You know how crazy Dad was to get invited in a house anyhow and be entertained . Especially a parsonage . He always acted like a parsonage was a kind ofp295holy place and him the holy guest . He also liked to see and talk to the woman of the house and the kids . I do n't blame him after living in that dump of a hotel in Blackshcr all this time . But all he said to me was he figured he was halfway to our place , he might as well come the rest of the way . I guess he knew he would n't have the door shut in his face here . So he took the turnpike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? " " I do n't know what time it was . It was in the middle of the night sometime . When he got off the turnpike he found he was short on gas . He made it to a country gas station but it was closed , the house dark . He said the needle showed empty so he sat there till daylight . Evidently this young preacher had n't bought him any gas either . I asked if it was n't pretty cold but he said he did n't mind . He knew they 'd open up sometime . When the station man got up , he told him how long he 'd been there . You know how Dad gets along with people . This man never saw him before but he took him in the house and his wife made him some hot coffee and breakfast . Wonderful people , ' Dad said . He told me he said a prayer and left a dollar under his plate for the wife . When he got here , he claimed everything was fine but Ellen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he acted a little embarrassed . You know how he was at fancy places where he did n't feel congenial or welcome . But he never acted that way here before . I think he was embarrassed for this young preacher and his kind of religion . Any/how his cold got worse , settled on his chest and turned into pneumonia . Such a thing never happened before and never would have stopped him if it had , but it did now . He did n't seem to have any fight . I can guess what took it out of him . You know how much Dad thought of the ministry , servingGod , his fellow man and all that . Well the way that young preacher made use of him and then let him down I think killed something inside of him . Doc pulled him through the pneumonia all right but he said he could n't do much now if Dad did n't care whether or not he got well . " Tim was at the hospital waiting for them when they arrived . He had come by car yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to shave him , " he told Johnny in the hall . " He said he wanted to look right for you . " That troubled Johnny . " How are you , Dad ? " he asked , bending over to kiss him . For a moment the old teasing shape came to his lips , as when about to say one of his fun-loving pleasantries to children . " If I said I was tiptop , I guess I 'd be telling you a lie , Johnny , " he said . Today there was a rueful smile with it . All through their visit another smile kept coming , a facial politeness typical of him with certain parishioners , those he did n't feel close to or who asked too much of him , an effort to be hearty , pleasant , perhaps a little too pleasant , a side of him never shown to the family . It disturbed Johnny . Thep297old hymn his father used to sing so much came back to him , " I 'm a pilgrim and I 'm a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " Were those words early discernment ? Had his father returned to his unknown secret self ? Was he now again a pilgrim from some unworldly land , treating his own sons with the cordial formality of strangers ? The only one his father spoke of in the old unchanged way was their mother . " I was thinking about her last night . And our wedding trip . You know she and I went to Philadelphia on the train and took the night boat for Boston . Since we were just married , I supposed , a bride and groom , we were invited to sit at the captain 's table . I can still see her . Your mother . She sat right next to the captain talking and laughing to him . She could do that . All the Morgans could . They said she took after her English grandmother . I guess it was true . She kept calm all through her life like the English . She could see when things were n't right but she would go right on and not give notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred up . I remember one time I got so provoked at her over something she did , or did n't do , I would n't speak to her . I think it was for two or three days . I 'm ashamed to think of it now . But she never abused me for it , just went on the same . She was a wonderful woman , your mother . " After the three boys had gone , the old preacher closed his eyes . He was grateful to have got through the ordeal . **26;3534;TOOLONG of the creek amusing me so much at first but in the later horror of that madness night becoming the babble and rave of evil angels in my head So not minding thebat or the rip finally , ending up cant sleep because too awake now and it 's 3 A.M. so the fire I stoke and I settle down and read the entire Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde novel in the wonderful little handsized leather book left there by smart Monsanto who also must 've read it withwide eyes on a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up and fetch water from gurgly creek and start breakfast of pancakes and syrup And saying to myself " So why fret when something goes wrong like your sleeping bag breaking in the night , use self reliance " " Screw the bats " I add . Marvelous opening moment in fact of the first afternoon I 'm left alone in the cabin and I make my first meal , wash my first dishes , nap , and wake up to hear the rapturous ring of silence or Heaven even within and throughout the gurgle of the creek When you say AM ALONE andthe cabin is suddenly home only because you made onemeal and washed your firstmeal dishes Then nightfall , the religious vestal lighting of the beautiful kerosene lamp it so you again wash it in the creek and this time just let the mantle drip dry in the sun , the late afternoon sun that disappears so quickly behind those giant high steep canyonwalls Nightfall , the kerosene lamp casts a glowin the cabin , I go out and pick some ferns like the ferns of the Lankavatara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful hairnet ! " Late afternoon fog pours inover the canyon walls , sweep , cover the sun , it gets cold ,  |p21even  the flies on the porch are as so sad as the fog on the peaks As daylight retreats the flies retreat like politeEmily Dickinson flies and when it 's dark they 're all asleepin trees or someplace At high noon they 're in the cabinwith you but edging further towards the open doorsill as the afternoon lengthens , how strangely gracious There 's the hum of the bee drone two blocks away the racket of it you 'd think it was right over the roof , when the bee drone swirls nearer and nearer ( gulp again ) you retreat into the cabin and wait , maybe they got a message to come and see you all two thousand of em But gettingused to the bee drone finally which seems to happenlike a big party once a week .

I fix up my sleeping bag on the porch of the cabin but at 2 A.M. the fog starts dripping all wet so I have to go indoors with wet sleeping bag and make new arrangements but who cant sleep like a log in a solitary cabin in the woods , you wake up in the late morning so refreshed and realizing the universe namelessly : the universe is an Angel But easy enough to say when you 've had your escapefrom the gooky city turn into a success And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities " at last , you dream of long gray journeys to cities where soft evenings 'll unfold like Paris but never seeing how sickeningit will be because of the primordial innocence ofhealth and stillness in the wilds So I tell myself " BeWise.

Yay , for this , more aloneness " " Go back to childhood , just eat apples and read your Cathechism  --  sit on curbstones , the hell with the hot lights of Hollywood " ( remembering that awful time only a year earlier when I had to rehearse my reading of prose a third time under the hot lights of the Steve Allen Show in the Burbank studio , one hundred technicians waiting for me to start reading , Steve Allen watching me expectant as he plunks the piano , I sit there on the dunce 's stool and refuse to read a word or open my mouth , " I do nt have to REHEARSE for God 's sakeSteve ! " " But go ahead , we just wanta get the tone ofyour voice , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress rehearsal " and I sit there sweating not saying a word for a whole minute as everybody watches , finally I say " No I cant do it " and I go across the street to get drunk ) ( but surprising everybody the night of the show by doing myp25job of reading just fine , which surprises the producers and so they take me out with a Hollywood starlet who turns out to be a big bore trying to read me her poetry and wont talk love because in Hollywood man love is for sale ) So even that marvelous , long remembrances of life all the time in the world to just sit there or lie there or walk about slowly remembering all the details of life which now because a million lightyears away have taken on the aspect ( as they must 've for Proust in his sealed room ) of pleasant mental movies brought up at will and projected for furtherstudy And pleasure As I imagine God to be doingthis very minute , watching his own movie , which is us . Even when one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sleep but a rat suddenly runs over my head , it 's marvelous because I then take the folding cot and put a big wide board on it that covers both sides , so I wont sink into the canvas confines there , and place two old sleepingbags over the board , then my own on top , I have the most marvelous and rat free and in fact healthy-forthe-backbed in the world . I also take long curious hikes to see what 's what in the other direction inland , going up a few miles along the dirt road that leads to isolated ranches and logging campsI come to giant sad quiet valleys where you see 150 foot tall redwood trees with sometimes one little bird right on the topmost peaktwig sticking straight up The birdbalances up there surveying the fog and the great treesYou see one single flower nodding on a cliff side far across the canyon , or a huge knot in a redwood tree looking like Zeus ' face , or some of God 's little crazy creations goofing around in creek pools ( zigzag bugs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.P.Passey , No Trespassing , "  |p26or  terraces of fern in the dripping redwood shade , and you think " A long way from the beat generation , in this rain forest " So I angle back down to the home canyon and down the path past the cabin and out to the sea where the mule is on the sea shore , nibbling under that one thousand foot bridge or sometimes just standing staring at me withbig brown Garden of Eden eyes The mule being a petof one of the families who have a cabin in the canyon and it , as I say Alf by name , just wanders from one end of the canyon where the corral fence stops him , to the wild seashorewhere the sea stops him but a strange Gauguinesque mule when you first see him , leaving his black dung on the perfect white sand , an immortal and primordial muleowning a whole valley I even finally later find outwhere Alf sleeps which is like a sacred grove of trees inthat dreaming meadow of heather So I feed All the last of my apples which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muzzle , never biting , just muffing up my apple from my outstretched palm , and chomping away sadly , turning to scratch his behind against a tree with a big erotic motion that gets worse and worse till finally he 's standing there with erectile dong that would scare the Whore of Babylon let alone me . All kinds of strange and marvelous things like the weird Ripley situation of a huge tree that 's fallen across a creek maybe 500 years ago and 's made a bridge thereby , the other end of its trunk is now buried in ten feet of silt and foliage , strange enough but out of the middle trunk over the water rises straight another redwood tree looking like it 's been planted in the treetrunk , or stuck down into it by a God hand , I cant figure it out and stare at this chewing furiously on big choking handfulls of peanuts like a collegep27boy ( and only weeks before falling on my head in theBowery ) Even when a rancher car goes by I daydreammad ideas like , here comes Farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 60-foot redwood tree under my arm walking slowly pulling it along , they are amazed and scared , " Are we dreaming ? can anybodybe that strong ? " they even ask me and my big Zen answer is " You only think I 'm strong " and I go ondown the road carrying my tree This has me laughingin clover fields for hours I pass a cow which turnsto look at me as it takes a big dreamy crap Backin the cabin I light the fire and sit sighing and there are leaves skittering on the tin roof , it 's August in BigSur I fall asleep in the chair and when I wake upI 'm facing the thick little tangled woods outside the door and I suddenly remember them from long ago , even to the particular clumpness of the thickets , stem by stem , the twist of them , like an old home place , but just as I 'm wondering what all this mess is , bang , the wind closes thecabin door on my sight of it ! So I conclude " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adding , as I getup , in a loud English Lord voice nobody can hear anyway , " An issue broached is an issue smote , Sire , " pronouncing " issue " like " iss-yew " And this has me laughing allthrough supper Which is potatoes wrapped in foil andthrown on the fire , and coffee , and hunks of Spam roastedon a spit , and applesauce and cheese And when I lightthe lamp of aftersupper reading , here comes the nightlymoth to his nightly death at my lamp After I put outthe lamp temporarily , there 's the moth sleeping on the wall not realizing I 've put it on again . Meanwhile by the way and however , every day is coldp28and cloudy , or damp , not cold in the eastern sense , and every night is absolutely fogo. no stars whatever to be seenBut this too turns out to be a marvelous circumstance as I find out later , it 's the " damp season " and the other dwellers ( weekenders ) of the canyon do nt come out on weekends , I 'm absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the sun conquered the fog suddenly I was amazed to hear laughing and scratching all up and down the valley which had been mine only mine , and when I tried to go to the beach to squat and write there were whole families having outings , some of them younger people who 'd simply parked their cars up on the high bridge bluff and climbed down ) ( some of them in fact gangs of yelling hoodlums ) So the rainforest summerfog was grand and besides when the sun prevailed in August a horrible development took place , huge blasts of frightening gale like wind came pouring into the canyon making all the trees roar with a really frightening intensity that sometimes built up to a booming war of trees thatshook the cabin and woke you up And was in fact oneof the things that contributed to my mad fit . But the most marvelous day of all when I completely forgot who I was where I was or the time a day just with my pants rolled up above my knees wading in the creek rearranging , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I stooped ( near the sandy shore ) to get jugfulswould , instead of just sluggishly passing by shallow over mud , with bugs in it , now come rushing in a pure gurgly clear stream and deep too I dug into the whitesand and arranged underground rocks so now I could stick a jug in there and tilt the opening to the stream and it would fill up instantly with clear rushing unstagnatedp29bugless drinking water Making a mill race , is what it'scalled And because now the water rushed so fast anddeep right by the sandy stooping place I had to build a kind of seawall of rocks against that rush so that the shorewould not be silted away by the race Doing that , fortifying the outside of the seawall with smaller rocks and finally at sundown with bent head over my sniffling endeavors ( the way a kid sniffles when he 's been playing all day ) I start inserting tiny pebbles in the spaces between the stones so that no water can sneak over to wash away the shore , even down to the tiniest sand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood plank for everybody to kneel on when they come there to fetch their holy waterLooking up from this work of an entire day , from noon till sundown , amazed to see where I was , who I was , what I 'd done The absolute innocence like of Indianfashioning a canoe all alone in the woods And as I sayonly weeks earlier I 'd fallen flat on my head in the Boweryand everybody thought I 'd hurt myself So I makesupper with a happy song and go out in the foggy moonlight ( the moon sent its white luminescence through ) and marveled to watch the new swift gurgling clear water runwith its pretty flashes of light " And when the fog'sover and the stars and the moon come out at night it 'll be a beautiful sight . " And such things A whole mess of little joys like thatamazing me when I came back in the horror of later to see how they 'd all changed and become sinister , even my poor little wood platform and mill race when my eyes and my stomach nauseous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to explain and best thingto do is not be false.  |p30BECAUSE  ON THE FOURTH DAY I BEGAN TO GET BORED andnoted it in my diary with amazement , " Already bored ?

That being the first indication of my later flip Butalso on the day of leaving the cabin to hitch hike back to Frisco and see everybody and by now I 'm tired of my food ( forgot to bring jello , you need jello after all that bacon fat and cornmeal in the woods , every woodsmanneeds jello ) ( or cokes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm now so scared by that iodine blast by the sea and by the boredom of the cabin I take 20 dollars worth of perishable food left and spread it out on a big board below the cabin porch for the bluejays and the raccoonand the mouse and the whole lot , pack up , and go But before I go I realize this isnt my own cabin(here 's the second signpost of my madness ) , I have no right to hide Monsanto 's rat poison , as I 've been doing , feeding the mouse instead , as I said So like a dutifulguest in another man 's cabin I take the cover off the rat poison but compromise by simply leaving the box on the top shelf , so nobody can complain  --  And go off like that But during my absence , but You 'll see.  |p43WITH  MY MIND EVEN AND UPRIGHT and abiding nowhere , as Hui Neng would say , I go dancing off like a fool from my sweet retreat , rucksack on back , after only three weeks and really after only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for the city " You go out in joy andin sadness you return , " says Thomas a Kempis talking about all the fools who go forth for pleasure like high school boys on Saturday night hurrying clacking down the sidewalk to the car adjusting their ties and rubbing their hands with anticipatory zeal , only to end up Sunday morning groaning in bleary beds that Mother has to makeanyway It 's a beautiful day as I come out of thatghostly canyon road and step out on the coast highway , just this side of Raton Canyon bridge , and there they are , thousands and thousands of tourists driving by slowly on the high curves all oo ing and as ing at all that vast blue panorama of seas washing and raiding at the coast ofCalifornia I figure I 'll get a ride into Monterey realp44easy and take the bus there and be in Frisco by nightfall for a big ball of wino yelling with the gang , I feel in fact Dave Wain ought a be back by now , or Cody will be ready for a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , forgettingentirely that only three weeks previous I 'd been sent fleeing from that gooky city by the horrors But had nt the sea told me to flee back to my own reality ? But it is beautiful especially to see up ahead north a vast expanse of curving seacoast with inland mountains dreaming under slow clouds , like a scene of ancient Spain , or properly really like a scene of the real essentially Spanish California , the old Monterey pirate coast right there , you can see what the Spaniards must 've thought when they came around the bend in their magnificent sloopies and saw all that dreaming fatland beyond the seashore whitecap doormat Like the land of gold The old Monterey and Big Sur and Santa Cruz magicSo I confidently adjust my pack straps and start trudging down the road looking back over my shoulder to thumb . This is the first time I 've hitch hiked in years and I soon begin to see that things have changed in America , you cant get a ride any more ( but of course especially on a strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ) Sleek long stationwagon after wagoncomes sleering by smoothly , all colors of the rainbow and pastel at that , pink , blue , white , the husband is in the driver 's seat with a long ridiculous vacationist hat with along baseball visor making him look witless and idiot Beside him sits wifey , the boss of America , wearing dark glasses and sneering , even if he wanted to pick me up oranybody up she would n't let him But in the two deepbackseats are children , children , millions of children , allp45ages , they 're fighting and screaming over ice cream , they 're spilling vanilla all over the Tartan seatcovers There 's no room anymore anyway for a hitch hiker , tho conceivably the poor bastard might be allowed to ride like a meek gunman or silent murderer in the very back platformof the wagon , but here no , alas ! here is ten thousand racks of dxycleaned and perfectly pressed suits and dresses of all sizes for the family to look like millionaires every time they stop at a roadside dive for bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to get creaseda little in the front he 's made to take down a fresh pair of slacks from the back rack and go on , like that , bleakly , tho he might have secretly wished just a good oldtime fishing trip alone or with his buddies for this year 's vacationBut the P.T.A . has prevailed over every one of his desires by now , 1960 's , it 's no time for him to yearn for Big Two Hearted River and the old sloppy pants and the string of fish in the tent , or the woodfire with Bourbonat night It 's time for motels , roadside driveins , bringing napkins to the gang in the car , having the carwashed before the return trip And if he thinks hewants to explore any of the silent secret roads of America it 's no go , the lady in the sneering dark glasses has now become the navigator and sits there sneering over her previously printed blue-lined roadmap distributed by happy executives in neckties to the vacationists of Americawho would also wear neckties ( after having come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long visored hats , dark glasses , pressed slacks and baby 's first shoes dipped in gold oil dangling from the dashboard Sohere I am standing in that road with that bigwoeful rucksack but also probably with that expressionp46of honor on my face after all those nights sitting in the seashore under giant black cliffs , they see in me the very apotheosical opposite of their every vacation dream and of course drive on That afternoon I say about 5 thousandcars or probably 3 thousand passed me not one ofthem ever dreamed of stopping Which did nt botherme anyway because at first seeing that gorgeous long coast up to Monterey I thought " Well I 'll just hike rightin , it 's only 14 miles , I ought a do that easy " And on the way there 's all kindsa interesting things to see anywaylike the seals barking on rocks below , or quiet old farms made of logs on the hills across the highway , or sudden upstretches that go along dreamy seaside meadows where cows grace and graze in full sight of endless bluePacific But because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun is beating hot on the tar road , the heat finally gets through the soles and I begin to deliver heat blisters in my sockiboos I 'm limpingalong wondering what 's the matter with me when I realizeI 've got blisters I sit by the side of the road andlook I take out my first aid kit from the pack andapply unguents and put on cornpads and carry on But the combination of the heavy pack and the heat of the road increases the pain of the blisters until finally I realize I 've got to hitch hike a ride or never make it to Monterey at all . But the tourists bless their hearts after all , they couldnt know , only think I 'm having a big happy hike with my rucksack and they drive on , even tho I stick out my thumb I 'm in despair because I 'm really stranded now , and by the time I 've walked seven miles I still have sevento go but I cant go on another step I 'm also thirstyp47and there are absolutely no filling stations or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it developsnow into a day of complete torture , from nine o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon I negotiate those nine or so miles when I finally have to stop and sitdown and wipe the blood off my feet And then whenI fix the feet and put the shoes on again , to hike on , I can only do it mincingly with little twinkletoe steps like Babe Ruth , twisting footsteps every way I can think of not topress too hard on any particular blister So that thetourists ( lessening now as the sun starts to go down ) can now plainly see that there 's a man on the highway limpingunder a huge pack and asking for a ride , but still they 're afraid he may be the Hollywood hitch hiker with the hidden gun and besides he 's got a rucksack on his back as tho he 'd just escaped from the war in CubaOr 's got dismembered bodies in the bag anyway Butas I say I do nt blame them . The only car that passes that might have given me a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's a rattly old car of some kind with a big bearded " South Coast Is the Lonely Coast " folksinger in it waving at me but finally a little truck pulls up and waits for me 50 yards ahead and I limprun that distance on daggers in my feet It 's a guy with a dog He 'll drive me to thenext gas station , then he turns off But when he learnsabout my feet he takes me clear to the bus station inMonterey Just as a gesture of kindness No particularreason , and I 've made no particular plea about my feet , just mentioned it . I offer to buy him a beer but he 's going on home for supper so I go into the bus station and clean up andp48change and pack things away , stow the bag in the locker , buy the bus ticket , and go limping quietly in the blue fog streets of Monterey evening feeling light as feather and happy as a millionaire The last time I ever hitchhiked And NO RIDES a sign.  |p49THE  NEXT SIGN IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old skid row hotel room I go to see Monsanto at his City Lights bookstore and he 's smiling and glad to see me , says " We were coming out to see you next weekend you should have waited , " but there 's something else in his expression When we 're alone he says " Your mother wrote and said your cat is dead . " Ordinarily the death of a cat means little to most men , a lot to fewer men , but to me , and that cat , it was exactly and no lie and sincerely like the death of my little brother I loved Tyke with all my heart , he was my baby whoas a kitten just slept in the palm of my hand with his little head hanging down , or just purring , for hours , just as longas I held him that way , walking or sitting He was likea floppy fur wrap around my wrist , I just twist him around my wrist or drape him and he just purred and purred and even when he got big I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this big cat in both hands with my arms out/stretched right over my head and he 'd just purr , he had complete confidence in me And when I 'd left New York to come to my retreat in the woods I 'd carefully kissed him and instructed him to wait for me , " Attendspour mug kitigingoo " But my mother said in the letterhe had died the NIGHT AFTER I LEFT ! But maybe you'llunderstand me by seeing for yourself by reading the letter : - " Sunday July 20 , 1960 , Dear Son , I 'm afraid you wont like my letter because I only have sad news for you right now . I really do nt know how to tell you this but Brace up Honey . I 'm going through hell myself . Little Tyke is gone . Saturday all day he was fine and seemed to pick up strength , but late at night I was watching T.V. a late movie . Just about 1:30 A.M. when he started belching and throwing up . I went to him and tried to fix him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold so I rapped him up in a Blanket then he started to throw up all over me . And that was the last of him . Needless to say how I feel and what I went through . I stayed up till day Break ' and did all I could to revive him but it was useless . I realized at 4 A.M. he was gone so at six I wrapped him up good in a clean blanket and at 7 A.M. went out todig his grave . I never did anything in my whole life so heart breaking as to bury my beloved little Tyke who was as human as you and I. I buried him under the Honeysucklevines , the corner , of the fence . I just cant sleep or eat . I keep looking and hoping to see him come through the cellar door calling Ma Wow . I 'm just plain sick and the weirdest thing happened when I buried Tyke , all the black Birds I fed all Winter seemed to have known what was going on . Honest Son this is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head and chirping , and settling on the fence , for a whole hour after Tyke was laid to rest that 's something I 'll never forget I wish Ihad a camera at the time but God and Me knows it and saw it . Now Honey I know this is going to hurt you but I had to tell you somehow . . . I 'm so sick not physically but heart sick . . . I just cant believe or realize that myBeautiful little Tyke is no more and that I wont be seeing him come through his little " Shanty " or Walking through the green grass . . . . P.S. I 've got to dismantle Tyke 's shanty , I just cant go out there and see it emptyas is . Well Honey , write soon again and be kind to yourself . Pray the real " God " Your old Mom X X X X XX . " So when Monsanto told me the news and I was sitting there smiling with happiness the way all people feel when they come out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , bang , my heart sank , it sank in fact with the same strange idiotic helplessness as when I took the unfortunate deep breath on the seashore All the premonitionstying in together . Monsanto sees that I 'm terribly sad , he sees my little smile ( the smile that came over me in Monterey just so glad to be back in the world after the solitudes and I 'd walked around the streets just bemusedly Mona Lisa'ingat the sight of everything ) He sees now how thatsmile has slowly melted away into a mawk of chagrin Of course he cant know since I did nt tell him and hardly wanta tell it now , that my relationship with my cat and the other previous cats has always been a little dotty : some kind of psychological identification of the cats with my dead brother Gerard who 'd taught me to love catsp52when I was 3 and 4 and we used to lie on the floor on ourbellies and watch them lap up milk The death of " little brother " Tyke indeed Monsanto seeing me sodowncast says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more weeks or are you just gon na get drunkagain " " I 'm gon na get drunk yes " Because anywaythere are so many things brewing , everybody 's waiting , I 've been daydreaming a thousand wild parties inthe woods In fact it 's fortunate I 've heard of the deathof Tyke in my favorite exciting city of San Francisco , if I had been home when he died I might have gone mad in a different way but tho I now ran out to get drunk with the boys and still once in a while that funny little smile of joy came back as I drank , and melted away again because now the smile itself was a reminder of death , the news made me go mad anyway at the end of the three week binge , creeping up on me finally on that terribleday of St. Carolyn By The Sea as I can also call it All , all confusing till I explain . Meanwhile anyway poor Monsanto a man of letters wants to enjoy big news swappings with me about writing and what everybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs to Monsanto 's old rolltop desk making me also feel chagrin because it always was the ambition of my youth to end up a kind of literary businessmanwith a rolltop desk , combining my father image with the image of myself as a writer , which Monsanto without even thinking about it has accomplished at the drop of a hat ) Monsanto with his husky shoulders , big blue eyes , twinkling rosy skin , that perpetual smile of his that earned him the name Smiler in college and a smile you often wondered " Is it real ? " until you realizedp53if Monsanto should ever stop using that smile how could the world go on anyway It was that kind of smile tooinseparable from him to be believably allowed to disappear Wordswords words but he is a grand guy asI 'll show and now with real manly sympathy he really felt I should not go on big binges if I felt so bad , " At anyrate , " sez he , " you can go back a little later huh " " Okay Lorry " " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , I 'll tell you all about it It wasthe most happy three weeks of my life dammit and nowthis has to happen , poor little Tyke You should haveseen him a big beautiful yellow Persian the kind they callcalico " " Well you still have my dog Homer , and howwas Alf out there ? " " Alf the Sacred Burro , he ha , he stands in groves of trees in the afternoon suddenly you see him it 's almost scarey , but I fed him apples and shredded wheat and everything " ( and animals are so sad and patientI thought as I remembered Tyke 's eyes and Alf 's eyes , ah death , and to think this strange scandalous death comes also to human beings , yea to Smiler even , poorSmiler , and poor Homer his dog , and all of us ) I'malso depressed because I know how horrible my mother now feels all alone without her little chum in the house back there 3 thousand miles ( and indeed by Jesus it turns out later some silly beatniks trying to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and scared her so much she barricaded the door with furniture all the rest of that summer ) . But there 's old Ben Fagan puffing and chuckling over his pipe so what the hell , why bother grownup men and poets at that with your own troubles So Ben and I and his chum Jonesy also a chuckly pipesmoker go outP54to the bar ( Mike 's Place ) and sip a few beers , at first I vow I 'm not going to get drunk after all , we even go out to the park to have a long talk in the warm sun that always turns to delightful cool foggy dusk in that town of towns We 're sitting in the park of the big Italian white church watching kids play and people go by , for some reason I 'm bemused by the sight of a blonde woman hurrying somewhere " Where 's she going ? does she have a secret sailor lover ? is she only going to finish her typing afterhours in the office ? what if we knew Ben what every one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some restaurant , some secret romance " " You soundlike you stored up a lot of energy and innerest in life inthose woods " And Ben knows that for sure because he 's been months in the wilderness too , alone  --  Old Ben , much thinner than he used to be in our madder Dharma Bum days of 5 years ago , a little gaunt in fact , but still the same old Ben who stays up late at night chuckling over the Lankavatara Scripture and writing poems aboutraindrops And he knows me very well , he knows I'llget drunk tonight and for weeks on end just on general principles and that a day will come in a few weeks when I 'll be so exhausted I wont be able to talk to anybody and he 'll come and visit me and just silently at my side bepuffing his pipe , as I sleep The kind of guy he is I trying to explain about Tyke to him but some people are cat lovers and some ai nt , tho Ben always has a littlekitty around his pad His pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow ' pon which he sits crosslegged , by a smoking teapot , his bookshelves full of Stein andPound and Wallace Stevens A strange quiet poet whowas only beginning to be recognized as a big rosy secretp55sage ( one of his lines " When I leave town all my friends go back on the sauce " ) And I 'm on my way to thesauce right now . Because anyway old Dave Wain is back and Dave I can see him rubbing his hands in anticipation of another big wild binge with me like we had the year before when he drove me back to New York from the west coast , with George Baso the little Japanese Zen master hepcat sittingcrosslegged on the back mattress of Dave 's jeepster ( Willie the Jeep ) , a terrific trip through Las Vegas , St. Louis , stopping off at expensive motels and drinking nothing but the best Scotch out of the bottle all the way And what better way to go back to New York , Icould have blown 190 dollars on an airplane AndDave 's never met the great Cody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the park andslowly walk to the bar on Columbus Street and I order my first double bourbon and gingerale . The lights are twinkling on outside in that fantastic toy street , I can feel the joy rise in my soul I now remember Big Sur with a clear piercing love and agony and even the death of Tyke fits in with everything but Idont realize the enormity of what 's yet to come Wecall up Dave Wain who 's back from Reno and he comes blattin down to the bar in his jeepster driving that marvelousway he does ( once he was a cab-driver ) talking all the time and never making a mistake , in fact as good a driver as Cody altho I cant imagine anybody being thatgood and asked Cody about it the next day But oldjealous drivers always point out faults and complain , " Ah well that Dave Wain of yours does nt takes his curves right , he eases up and sometimes even pokes the brake a littlep56instead of just ridin that old curve around on increased power , man you got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way and parenthetically , that there 's so much to tell about the fateful following three weeks it 's hardly possible to find anyplace to begin . Like life , actually And how multiple it all is ! " And what happened to little old George Baso , boy ? " " Little old George Baso is probably dyin of T.B . in ahospital outsida Tulare " " Gee , Dave , we got ta go seehim " " Yessir , let 's do that tomorrow " As usual Dave has no money whatever but that does nt bother me at all , I 've got plenty , I go out the following day and cash 500 dollars worth of travelers checks just so 's me andold Dave can really have a good time Dave likes goodfood and drink and so do I But he 's got this youngkid he brought back from Reno called Ron Blake who is a goodlooking teenager with blond hair who wants to be a sensational new Chet Baker singer and comes on with that tiresome hipster approach that was natural 5 or 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pose , in fact I dug him as a con man conning Dave ( tho forwhat , I do nt know ) But Dave Wain that lean rangyred head Welchman with his penchant for going off in Willie to fish in the Rogue River up in Oregon where he knows an abandoned mining camp , or for blattin around the desert roads , for suddenly reappearing in town to get drunk , and a marvelous poet himself , has that certain something that young hip teenagers probably wantaimitate For one thing is one of the world 's best talkers , and funny too As I 'll show It was he and GeorgeBaso who hit on the fantastically simple truth that everybody in America was walking around with a dirty behind ,  |p57but  everybody , because the ancient ritual of washing with water after the toilet had not occurred in all the modern antisepticsm Says Dave " People in America have allthese racks of drycleaned clothes like you say on their trips , they spatter Eau de Cologne all over themselves , they wear Ban and Aid or whatever it is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shirt or a dress , they probably change underwear and socks maybe even twice a day , they go around all puffed up and insolent thinking themselves the cleanest people on earth and they 're walkin around with dirty azzoles Isnt that amazing ? give me a little nip on that tit " he says reaching for my drink so I order two more , I 've been engrossed , Dave can order all the drinks he wants anytime , " The President of the United States , the big ministers of state , the great bishops and shmishops and big shots everywhere , down to the lowest factory worker with all his fierce pride , movie stars , executives and great engineers and presidents of law firms and advertising firms with silk shirts and neckties and great expensive traveling cases in which they place these various expensive English importedhair brushes and shaving gear and pomades and perfumes are all walkin around with dirty azzoles ! All you got ta do is simply wash yourself with soap and water ! it has nt occurred to anybody in America at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard of ! do nt you think it 's marvelous that we 're being called filthy unwashed beatniks but we 're the only ones walkin around with cleanazzoles ? " The whole azzole shot in fact had spreadswiftly and everybody I knew and Dave knew from coast to coast had embarked on this great crusade which I mustsay is a good one In fact in Big Sur I 'd instituted ap58shelf in Monsanto 's outhouse where the soap must be kept and everyone had to bring a can of water there on each trip Monsanto had nt heard about it yet , " Do you realize that until we tell poor Lorenzo Monsanto the famous writer that he is walking around with a dirty azzole hewill be doing just that ? " " Let 's go tell him right now ! " " Why of course if we wait another minute . . . andbesides do you know what it does to people to walk around with a dirty azzole ? it leaves a great yawning guilt that they cant understand all day , they go to work all cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launderedclothes and Eau de Cologne in the commute train yet there 's something gnawing at them , something 's wrong , they know something 's wrong they do nt know justwhat ! " We rush to tell Monsanto at once in the bookstore around the corner . By now we 're beginning to feel great Fagan hasretired saying typically " Okay you guys go ahead and get drunk , I 'm goin home and spend a quiet evening in ahot bath with a book " " Home " is also where DaveWain and Ron Blake live It 's an old roominghouse of four stories on the edge of the Negro district of San Francisco where Dave , Ben , Jonesy , a painter called Lanny Meadows , a mad French Canadian drinker called Pascal and a Negro called Johnson all live in different rooms with their clutter of rucksacks and floor mattresses and books and gear , each one taking turns one day a week to go out and do all the shopping and come back andcook up a big communal dinner in the kitchen Allten or twelve of them sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they end up living comfortable lives with wild parties and girls rushing in , people bringingp59bottles , all at about a minimum of seven dollars a week say It 's a wonderful place but at the same time a little maddening , in fact a whole lot maddening because the painter Lanny Meadows loves music and has installed his Hi Fi speaker in the kitchen altho he applies the records in a back room so the daily cook may be concentrating on his Mulligan stew and all of a suddenStravinski 's dinosaurs start dinning overhead And atnight there are bottlecrashing parties usually supervised by wild Pascal who is a sweet kid but crazy when hedrinks A regular nuthouse actually and just exactlythe image of what the journalists want to say about the Beat Generation nevertheless a harmless and pleasant arrangement for young bachelors and a good idea in the long run Because you can rush into any room andfind the expert , like say Ben 's room and ask " Hey whatdid Bodhidharma say to the Second Patriarch ? " " He said go fuck yourself , make your mind like a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bug me with youroutside plans " " So the guy goes out and stands on his head in the snow ? " " No that was Fubar " Or you go runnin into Dave Wain 's room and there he is sitting crosslegged on his mattress on the floor reading Jane Austen , you ask " What 's the best way to make beefStroganoff ? " " Beef Stroganoff is very simple , ' t'aintnothin but a good well cooked beef and onion stew that you let cool afterwards then you throw in mushrooms and lotsa sour cream , I 'll come down and show way soon 's I finish this chapter in this marvelous novel , I wanta findout what happens next " Or you go into the Negro 's room and ask if you can borrow his tape recorder because right at the moment some funny things are being saidp60in the kitchen by Duluoz and McLear and Monsanto and some newspaperman Because the kitchen was also the main talking room where everybody sat in a clutter ofdishes and ashtrays and all kinds of visitors came Theyear before a beautiful 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , for instance , but chaperonedby a Chinese painter The phone rang consistently Even wild Negro hepcats from around the cornercame in with bottles ( Edward Kool and several others ) There was Zen , jazz , booze , pot and all the works butit was somehow obviated ( as a supposedly degenerate idea ) by the sight of a beatnik ' carefully painting the wall of his room and clean white with nice little red bordersaround the door and windowframes Or someone is sweeping out the livingroom . Itinerant visitors like me or Ron Blake always had an extra mattress to sleep on.  |p61BUT  DAVE IS ANXIOUS AND SO AM I to see great Cody whois always the major part of my reason for journeying to the west coast so we call him up at Los Gatos 50 miles away down the Santa Clara Valley and I hear his dear sad voice saying " Been waitin for ya old buddy , come on down right away , but I 'll be goin to work at midnight so hurry up and you can visit me at work soon 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new job of tire recappin and see if you cant bring a little somethin like a girl or sumptin , just kiddin , come on down pal So there 's old Willie waiting for us down on the street parked across from the little pleasant Japanese liquor store where as usual , according to our ritual , I run and get Pernod or Scotch or anything good while Dave wheels around to pick me up at the store door , and I get in the front seat right at Dave 's right where I belong all the time like old Honored Samuel Johnson while everybody else that wants to come along has to scramble back there onp62the mattress ( a full mattress , the seats are out ) and squat there or lie down there and also generally keep silent because when Dave 's got the wheel of Willie in his hand and I 've got the bottle in mine and we 're off on a trip the talking all comes from the front seat " By God " yells Dave all glad again " it 's just like old times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waitin for ya to comeback So now I 'm gon na show ya how old Willie'seven improved with age , had him reconditioned in Reno last month , here he goes , are you ready Willie ? " and off we go and the beauty of it all this particular summer is that the front right seat is broken and just rocks back andforth gently to every one of Dave 's driving moves It'slike sitting in a rocking chair on a porch only this is amoving porch and a porch to talk on at that Andinsteada watching old men pitch horseshoes from this here talking porch it 's all that fine white clean line in the middle of the road as we go flying like birds over the Harrison ramps and whatnot Dave always uses to sneakout of Frisco real fast and avoid all the traffic Soon we 're set straight and pointed head on down beautiful fourlane Bayshore Highway to that lovely Santa ClaraValley But I 'm amazed that after only a few years thedamn thing no longer has prune fields and vast beet fields like at Lawrence when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , it 's one long row of houses right down the line 50 miles to San Jose like a great monstrous Los Angeles beginning to grow south of Frisco . At first it 's beautiful to just watch that white line reel in to Willie 's snout but when I start looking around out the window there 's just endless housing tracts and new blue factories everywhere Sez Dave " Yes that 's right ,  |p63the  population explosion is gon na cover every bit of backyarddirt in America someday in fact they 'll even have to start piling up friggin levels of houses and others over that like your cityCityCITY till the houses reach a hundred miles in the air in all directions of the map and people looking at the earth from another planet with super telescopes will see a prickly ball hangin in space It 's like real horrible when you come to think of it , even us with all our fancy talks , shit man it 's all millions of people and events piling up almost unimaginable now , like raving babboons we 'll all be piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sposed to say Hundreds ofmillions of hungry mouths raving for more more moreAnd the sadness of it all is that the world has nt any chance to produce say a writer whose life could really actually touch all this life in every detail like you always say , some writer who could bring you sobbing thru the bed fuckin bedcribs of the moon to see it all even unto the goddamned last gory detail of some dismal robbery of the heart at dawn when no one cares like Sinatra sings " ( " When no one cares , " he sings in his low baritone but resumes ) :  --  " Some strict sweeper sweeping it all up , I mean the incredible helplessness I felt Jack when Caine ended his Journey To The End Of The Night by pissing in the Seine River at dawn there I am thinkin my God there 's probably somebody pissing in the Trenton River at dawn right now , the Danube , the Ganges , the frozen Obi , the Yellow , the Parana , the Willamette , the Merrimac in Missouri too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Thames , the Po , the so and so , it 's so friggin endless it 's like poems endless everywhere and no one knows any bettern old Buddha you know where he says it 's likep64There are immeasurable star misty aeons of universes more numerous than the sands in all the galaxies , multipliedby a billion lightyears of multiplication , in fact if I were to go on you 'd be scared and couldnt comprehend and you 'd despair so much you 'd drop dead , ' that 's what he just about said in one of those sutras Macrocosms and microcosms and chillicosms and microbes and finally you got all these marvelous books a man ai nt even got time to read em all , what you gon na do in this already piled up multiple world when you have to think of the Book of Songs , Faulkner , Cesar Birotteau , Shakespeare , Satyricons , Dantes , in fact long stories guys tell you in bars , in fact the sutras themselves , Sir Philip Sidney , Sterne , Ibn El Arabi , the copious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then there 's all those Catulluses and Davids and radio listening skid row sages to contend with because they 've all got a million stories too and you too Ron Blake in the backseat shut up ! down to everything which is so much that it is of necessity do nt you think NOthing anyway , huh ? " ( expressing exactly the way I feel , of course ) . And to corroborate all that about the too-much-ness of the world , in fact , there 's Stanley Popovich also in the back mattress next to Ron , Stanley Popovich of New York suddenly arrived in San Francisco with Jamie his Italian beauty girl but 's going to leave her in a few days to go work for the circus , a big tough Yugoslav kid who ran the Seven Arts Gallery in New York with big bearded beatnik readings but now comes the circus and a whole big on-the-road of his own It 's too much , in fact right this minute he 's started telling us about circus workOn top of all that old Cody is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big to keep up with , that we 're surrounded by life , that we 'll never understand it , so we center it all in by swigging Scotch from the bottle and when it 's empty I run out of the car and buy another one , period.  |p66BUT  ON THE WAY TO CODY 'S MY MADNESS ALREADY BEGANTO MANIFEST ITSELF Ill a stranger way , another one of those signposts of something wrong I mentioned a ways back : I thought I saw a flying saucer in the sky over Los Gatos From five miles away I look and I see this thingflying along and mention it to Dave who takes one brief look and says " Ah it 's only the top of a radio tower " It reminds me of the time I took a mescaline pill and thought an airplane was a flying saucer ( a strange story this , a man has to be crazy to write it anyway ) . But there 's old Cody in the livingroom of his fine ranchito home sittin over his chess set pondering a problemand right by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out because she knows I love fireplacesShe a good friend of mine too The kids are sleeping in the back , it 's about eleven , and good old Cody shakesmy hand again Havent seen him for several yearsbecause mainly he 's just spent two years in San Quentinp67on a stupid charge of possession of marijuana He was on his way to work on the railroad one night and was short on time and his driving license had been already revoked for speeding so he saw two bearded bluejeaned beatniks parked , asked them to trade a quick ride to work at the railroad station for two sticks of tea , they complied and arrested him They were disguised policemenFor this great crime he spent two years in San Quentinin the same cell with a murderous gunman His jobwas sweeping out the cotton mill room I expect himto be all bitter and out of his head because of this but strangely and magnificently he 's become quieter , moreradiant , more patient , manly , more friendly even Andtho the wild frenzies of his old road days with me have banked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles and looks like he 's ready to go anytime But actually loves his home ( paid for by railroadinsurance when be broke his leg trying to stop a boxcar from crashing ) , loves his wife in a way tho they fight some , loves his kids and especially his little son TimmyJohn partly named after me Poor old , good old Codysittin there with his chess set , wants immediately to challengesomebody to a chess game but only has an hour to talk to us before he goes to work supporting the family by rushing out and pushing his Nash Rambler down the quiet Los Gatos suburb street , jumping in , starting the motor , in fact his only complaint is that the Nashwont start without a push No bitter complaints aboutsociety whatever from this grand and ideal man who really loves me moreover as if I deserved it , but I 'm bursting to explain everything to him , not even Big Sur but the past several years , but there 's no chance with everybodyp68yakking And in fact I can see in Cody 's eyes thathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that recently we havent had chances to talk whatever , like we used to do driving across America and back in the old road days , too many people now want to talk to us and tell us their stories , we 've been hemmed in and surroundedand outnumbered The circle 's closed in onthe old heroes of the night But he says " Howeveryou guys , come on down round ' bout one when the boss leaves and watch me work and keep me company awhilebefore you go back to the City " I can see Dave Wainreally loves him at once , and Stanley Popovich too who 's come along on this trip just to meet the fabled " DeanMoriarty " The name I give Cody in " On the Road " But O , it breaks my heart to see he 's lost his beloved job on the railroad and after all the seniority he 'd piled up since 1948 and now is reduced to tire recapping and dreary parole visits All for two sticks of wild loco weedthat grows by itself in Texas because God wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me and Cody arm in arm in the early days on a sunny streetI rush to explain to Cody what happened the year before when his religious advisor at the prison had invited me to come to San Quentin to lecture the religious classDave Wain was supposed to drive me and wait outside the prison walls as I 'd go in there alone , probably with a pepup nip bottle hidden in my coat ( I hoped ) and I 'd be led by big guards to the lecture room of the prison and there would be sitting a hundied or so cons including Cody probably all proud in the front rowAnd I would begin by telling them I had been in jail myself once and that I had no right nevertheless to lee/ture them on religion But they 're all lonely prisonersand do nt care what I talk about The whole thingarranged , in any case , and on the big morning I wake up instead dead drunk on a floor , it 's already noon and too late , Dave Wain is on the floor also , Willie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's toolate But now Cody says " It 's alright old buddy I understand " Althoour friend Irwin had done it , lecturedthere , but Irwin can do all sorta things like that being more social than I am and capable of going in there as he did and reading his wildest poems which set the prison yard humming with excitement tho I think he shouldna done it after all because I say just to show up for any reasonexcept visiting inside a prison is still SIGNIFYING And I tell this to Cody who ponders a chess problem and says " Drinkin again , hey ? " ( if there 's anything he hates is to see me drink ) . We help him push his Nash down the street , then drink awhile and talk with Evelyn a beautiful blonde woman that young Ron Blake wants and even Dave Wain wants but she 's got her mind on other things and taking care of the children who have to go to school and dancing classes in the morning and hardly gets a word in edgewise anywayas we all yak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really wants is to be alone with me to talk about Cody and his latest soul . Which includes the fact of Billie Dabney his mistress who has threatened to take Cody away completely from Evelyn , as I 'll show later . So we do go out to the San Jose highway to watch Cody recap tires There he is wearing goggles working like Vulcan at his forge , throwing tires all over the placep70with fantastic strength , the good ones high up on a pile , " This one 's no good " down on another , bing , bang , talkingall the time a long fantastic lecture on tire recapping which has Dave Wain marvel with amazement ( " MyGod he can do all that and even explain while he 's doing it " ) But I just mention in connection with the factthat Dave Wain now realizes why I 've always loved Cody Expecting to see a bitter ex con he sees instead amartyr of the American Night in goggles in some dreary tire shop at 2 A.M. making fellows laugh with joy with his funny explanations yet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work he 's being paid for Rushing up and ripping tires off car wheels with a jicklo , clang , throwing it on the machine , starting up big roaring steams but yelling explanations over that , darting , bending , flinging , flaying , till Dave Wain said he thought he was going to die laughing or crying right there on the spot . So we drive back to town and go to the mad boardinghouseto drink some more and I pass out dead drunk on the floor as usual in that house , waking up in the morning groaning far from my clean cot on the porch in Big Sur No bluejays yakking for me to wake up any more , nogurgling creek , I 'm back in the grooky city and I 'm trapped.  |p71INSTEAD  THERE 'S THE SOUND OF BOTTLES CRASHING in thelivingroom where poor Lex Pascal is holding forth yelling , it reminds of the time a year ago when Jarry Wagner 's future wife got sore at Lex and threw a half gallonfull of tokay across the room and hooked him right across the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big Zen ceremony that made coast to coast papers but all old Lex 's got is a cut which I try to fix in the bathroom upstairssaying " Hey , that cut 's already stopped bleeding , you 'll be alright Lex " " I 'm French Canadian too " he says proudly and when Dave and I and George Baso get ready to drive back to New York he gives me a St.Christophermedal as a goingaway gift Lex the kind of guyshouldnt really be living in this wild beat boardinghouse , should hide on a ranch somewhere , powerful , goodlooking , full of crazy desire for women and booze and neverenough of either So as the bottles crash again and theHi Fi 's playing Beethoven 's Solemn Mass I fall asleep on the floor.  |p72Waking  up the next morning groaning of course , but this is the big day when we 're going to go visit poor George Baso at the TB hospital in the Valley Daveperks me up right away bringing coffee or wine optionalI 'm on Ben Fagan 's floor somehow , apparently I 've harangued him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now suddenly appears Joey Rosenberg a strange young kid from Oregon with a full beard and his hair growing right down to his neck like Raul Castro , once the California High School high jump champ who was only about 5 foot 6 but had made the incredible leap of six foot nine over the bar ! and shows his highjump ability too by the way he dances around on light feet A strange athlete who 's suddenly decidedinstead to become some sort of beat Jesus and in fact you see perfect purity and sincerity in his young blueeyes In fact his eyes are so pure you do nt notice the crazy hair and beard , and also he 's wearing ragged but strangely elegant clothing ( " One of the first of the new Beat Dandies , " McLear told me a few days later , " did you hear about that ? there 's a new strange underground group of beatniks or whatever who wear special smooth dandy clothes even tho it may just be a jean jacket with shino slacks they 'll always have strange beautiful shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpressedacourse but with torn sneakers " ) Joey is wearing something like brown soft garments like a tunic or somethingand his shoes look like Las Vegas sports shoes The moment he sees my battered blue little sneakers that I 'd used at Big Sur when my feet go sore , ' that is in case my feet got sore on a rocky hike , he wants them for him/self , he wants to swap the snazzy Las Vegas sports shoes ( pale leather , untooled ) for my silly little tightfitting tho perfect sneakers that in fact I was wearing because the Monterey hike blisters were still hurting me So weswap And I ask Dave Wain about him : Dave says : " He 's one of the really strangest sweetest guys I 've ever known , showed up about a week ago I hear tell , they asked him what he wanted to do and never answers , just smiles He just sorta wants to dig everything and just watchand enjoy and say nothing particular about it If someone'sto ask him Let 's drive to New York ' he 'd jumpright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimage , see , with all that youth , us old fucks ought a take a lesson from him , in faith too , he has faith , I can see it in his eyes , he has faith in any direction he may take with anyone just like Christ I guess . " It 's strange that in a later revery I imagined myself walking across a field to find the strange gang of pilgrims in Arkansas and Dave Wain was sitting there saying " Shhh , He 's sleeping , " " He " being Joey and all the disciplesare following him on a march to New York after which they expect to keep going walking on water to the other shore But of course ( in my revery even ) Iscoff and do nt believe it ( a kind of story daydreaming I often do ) but in the morning when I look into Joey Rosenberg'seyes I instantly realize it IS Him , Jesus , because anyone ( according to the rules of my revery ) who looksinto those eyes is instantly convinced and converted So the revery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines trying to destroy this " Second Coming " etc. ( but also , in reality , a few months later I threw away his shoes in the ashcan back homep74because I felt they had brought me bad luck and wishing I 'd kept my blue sneakers with the little holes in the toes ! ) So anyway we get Joey and Ron Blake who 's always following Dave and go off to see Monsanto at the store , our usual ritual , then across the corner to Mike 's Place where we start off the 10 A.M. with food , drink and a few games of pool at the tables along the bar Joeywinning the game and a stranger poolshark you never saw with his long Biblical hair bending to slide the cue stick smoothly through completely professionally competentfingerstance and smashing home long straight drives , like seeing Jesus shoot pool of course And meanwhileall the food these poor starved kids all three of them dopack in and eat ! It 's not every day they 're with a drunken novelist with hundreds of dollars to splurge on them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jumbo Hamburgers , follow that up with ice cream and pie and puddings , Dave Wain has a huge appetite anyway but adds Manhattans and Martinis to the side ofhis plate I 'm just wailing away on my old fatal doublebourbons and gingerale and I 'll be sorry in a few days . Any drinker knows how the process works : the first day you get drunk is okay , the morning after means a big head but so you can kill that easy with a few more drinks and a meal , but if you pass up the meal and go on to another night 's drunk , and wake up to keep the toot going , and continue on to the fourth day , there 'll come one day when the drinks wont take effect because you 're chemicallyoverloaded and you 'll have to sleep it off but cant sleep any more because it was alcohol itself that made you sleep those last five nights , so delirium sets in Sleeplessness , sweat , trembling , a groaning feeling ofp75weakness where your arms are numb and useless , nightmares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's more of that up later . About noon which is now the peak of a golden blurry new day for me we pick up Dave 's girl Romana Swartz a big Rumanian monster beauty of some kind ( I mean with big purple eyes and very tall and big but Mae West big ) , Dave whispers in my ear " You ought a see her walkingaround that Zen-East House in those purple panties of hers , nothing else on , there 's one married guy lives there who goes crazy every time she goes down the hall tho I do nt blame him , would you ? she 's not trying to entice him or anybody she 's just a nudist , she believe in nudism and bygod she 's going to practice it ! " ( the Zen-East house being another sort of boardinghouse but this one for all kinds of married people and single and some small bohemian type families all races studying Subud or something , I never was there ) She 's a bigbeautiful brunette anyway in the line of taste you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also intelligent , well read , writes poetry , is a Zen student , knows everything , is in fact just simply a big healthy Rumanian Jewess who wants to marry a good hardy man and go live on a farm in the valley , that 's itThe T.B . hospital is about two hours away through Tracy and down the San Joaquin Valley , Dave drives beautiful with Romana between us and me holding the bottle again , it 's bright beautiful California sunshine and prune orchards out there zipping by It 's always funto have a good driver and a bottle and dark glasses on a fine sunny afternoon going somewhere interesting , andall the good conversation as I said Ron and Joey arep76on the back mattress sitting crosslegged just like poor George Baso had sat on that trip last year from Frisco to New York . But the main thing I 'd liked at once about that Japanesekid was what he told me the first night I met him in that crazy kitchen of the Buchanan Street house : from midnight to 6 A.M. in his slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Life of Buddha beginning with infancy and right down to the end George 's theory ( he has many theories and has actually run meditation classes with bells , just really a serious young lay priest of Japanese Buddhism when all is said and done ) is that Buddha did not reject amorous love life with his wife and with his harem girls because he was sexually disinterested but on the contrary had been taught in the highest arts of lovemaking and eroticism possible in the India of that time , when great tomes like the Kama Sutra were in the process of being developed , tomes that give you instructions on every act , facet , approach , moment , trick , lick , lock , bing and bang and slurp of how to make love with another human being " male or female " insisted George : " He knew everything there is to know about all kinds of sex so that when he abandoned the world of pleasure to go be an ascetic in the forest everybody of course knew that he wasnt puttingit all down out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marvelous respect for all hiswords And he was just no simple Casanova with afew frigid affairs across the years , man he went all the way , he had ministers and special eunuchs and special women who taught him love , special virgins were brought to him , he was acquainted with every aspect of perversityp77and non perversity and as you know he was also a great archer , horseman , he was just completely trained in all the arts of living by his father 's orders because his father wanted to make sure he 'd NEVER leave the palace They used every trick in the books to entice him to a life of pleasure and as you know they even had him happily married to a beautiful girl called Yasodhara and he had a son with her Rahula and he also had his harem which included dancing boys and everything in the books " then George would go into every detail of this knowledge , like " He knew that the phallus is held with the hand and moved inside the vagina with a rotary movement , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the lowering down of the gal 's hips so that the vulva you see recedes and the phallus is introduced with a fast quick movement like stinging of a wasp , or else the vulva is protruded by means of lifting up the hips high so that the member is buried with a sudden rush right to the basis , or then he can withdraw real teasing like , or concentrate on right or left side And then he knewall the gestures , words , expressions , what to do with a flower , what not to do with a flower , how to drink the lip in all kinds of kissing or how to crush kiss or soft kiss , man he was a genius in the beginning " ... and so on , George went all the way telling me this till 6 A.M. it being one of the most fantastic Buddha Charitas I 'd ever heard ending with George 's own perfect enunciation of the law of the Twelve Nirdanas whereby Buddha just logically disconnected all creation and laid it bare forwhat it was , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to New York with Dave and me up front talking all the way poor George just sat there on thep78mattress for the most part very quiet and told us he was taking this trip to find out if HE was traveling to New York or just the CAR ( Willie the Jeep ) was traveling to New York or was it just the WHEELS were rolling , or the tires , or what A Zen problem of some kind So that when we 'd see grain elevators on the Plains of Oklahoma George would say quietly " Well it seems to me that grain elevator is sorta waitin for the road to approach it " or he 'd say suddenly " While you guys was talkin just then about how to mix a good Pernod Martini I just saw a white horse standing in an abandoned storefront " In Las Vegas we 'd taken a good motel room and gone out to play a little roulette , in St.Louis we 'd gone to see the great bellies of the East St.Louis hootchy kootchy joints where three of the most marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew all about George and his theories about erogenous Buddha ( there sits the monarch observing the donzinggerls ) and as tho they knew anyway all about Dave Wain who wheneverhe sees a beautiful girls says licking his lips " Yum Yum . " .. . But now George has T.B . and they tell me he mayeven die Which adds to that darkness in my mind , all these DEATH things piling up suddenly But I cantbelieve old Zen Master George is going to allow his body to die just now tho it looks like it when we pass through the lawn and come to a ward of beds and see him sittingdejected on the edge of his bed with his hair hanging over his brow where before it was always combed back He 's in a bathrobe and looks up at us almost displeased ( but everybody is displeased by unexpected visitsfrom friends or relatives in a hospital ) Nobody wantsp79to be surprised on their hospital bad He sighs and comes out to the warm lawn with us and the expression on his face says " Well ah so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what do you really want ? " as tho all the old humorous courage of the year before has now given away to a profoundly deep Japanese skepticism like that of a Samurai warrior in a fit of suicidal depression ( surprising me by its abject gloomy fearful frown ) .  |p80I  MEAN IT WAS LIKE MY FIRST FRIGHTENED REALIZATION OF WHAT TO BE JAPANESE REALLY MEANT To be Japaneseand not to believe in life any more and to be gloomy like Beethoven yet to be Japanese in gloom , the gloom of Basho behind it all , the huge thunderous scowl of Issa or of Shiki , kneeling in the frost with the bowed head like the bowed-head-oblivion of all the old horses of Japan long dust . He sits there on the lawn bench looking down and when Dave asks him " Well you gon na be alright soon George " he says simply " I do nt know " He really means " I dontcare " And always warm and courteous with me henow hardly pays any attention to me He 's a little nervous because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's received a visit from a bunch of ragged beatniks including Joey Rosenberg who is bouncing around the lawn looking at flowers with that bemused sincere smile But little neat George , just 5 feet 5 and a few poundsp81over that and so clean , with his soft feathery hair like the hair of a child , his delicate hands , he just stares atthe ground His answers come like an old man 's ( he'sonly 30 ) " I guess all the Dharma talk about everything is nothing is just sorta sinking in my bones , " heconcedes , which makes me shudder ( On the wayDave 's been telling us to be ready because George'schanged so ) But I try to keep things going , " Do youremember those dancing girls in St.Louis ? " " Yeh , whore candy " ( he 's referring to a piece of perfumed cotton one of the girls threw at us in her dance , which we tacked up later to a highway accident cross we 'd yanked out of the ground one blood red sunset in Arizona , tacking this perfumed beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we brought the cross to New York naturally we had everybody smelling it but George pointed out how beautiful we 'd done all this subconsciouslybecause the net result was that all the hepcats of Greenwich Village who came in to see us were pickingup the cross and putting their heads ( noses ) to it ) But George does nt care any more And anyway it'stime to leave . But ah , as we 're leaving and waving back at him and he 's turned around tentatively to go into the hospital I linger behind the others and turn around several times to wave again Finally I start to make a joke of it byducking around a corner and peeking out and waving ' again He ducks behind a bush and waves back Idart to a bush and peek out Suddenly we 're two crazyhopeless sages goofing on a lawn Finally as we partfurther and further and he comes closer to the door we are making elaborate gestures and down to the mostp82infinitesimal like when he steps inside the door I wait tillI see him sticking a finger out So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door he sticksout an eye So from my corner I stick out nothing butjust yell " Wu ! " So from his door he sticks out nothingand says nothing So I hide in the corner and donothing But suddenly I burst out and there HE isbursting out and we start waving gyrations and duck backto our hiding places Then I pull a big one by simplywalking away rapidly but suddenly I turn and wave again He walking backwards and waving back The furtherI go now also walking backwards the more I wave Finally we 're so far apart by about a hundred yardsthe game is almost impossible but we continue somehow Finally I see a distant sad little Zen wave of hand I jump up into the air and gyrate both arms He doesthe same He goes into the hospital but a moment laterhe 's peeking out this time from the ward window ! I'mbehind a tree trunk thumbing my nose at him There'sno end to it , in fact The other kids are all back at thecar wondering what 's keeping me What 's keeping meis that I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and George knows I know this , that 's why he 's playing the game with me , the magic game of glad freedom which is what Zen or for that matter the Japanesesoul ultimately means I say , " And someday I will go to Japan with George " I tell myself after we 've made our last little wave because I 've heard the supper bell ring and seen the other patients rush for the chow line and knowing George 's fantastic appetite wrapped in that little frail body I do nt wanta hang him up tho he neverthelessp83does one last trick : He throws a glass of water out the window in a big froosh of water and I do nt see him any more . " Wotze mean by that ? " I 'm scratching my head going back to the car.  |p84To  COMPLETE THIS CRAZY DAY at 3 o'clock in the morninghere I am sitting in a car being driven 100 miles an hour around the sleeping streets and hills and waterfronts of San Francisco , Dave 's gone off to sleep with Romana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roominghouse ( himself a Bohemian but also a laborer , a housepainter who comes home with big muddy boots and has his little boy living with him the wife has died ) I 've been in his pad listening to boomingloud Stan Getz jazz on his Hi Fi and happened to mention I thought Dave Wain and Cody Pomeray werethe two greatest drivers in the world " What ? " heyells , a big blond husky kid with a strange fixed smile , " man I used to drive the getaway car ! come on down I 'll show ya ! " So almost dawn and here we are cuttindown Buchanan and around the corner on screeching wheels and he opens her up , goes zipping towards a red light so takes a sudden screeching left and goes up a hillp85fullblast , when we come to the top of the hill I figger he 'll pause awhile to see what 's over the top but he goes even faster and practically flies off the hill and we head down one of those incredibly steep San Fran streets with our snout pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas ! we go sailing down a hundred m.p.h. to the bottom of the hill where there 's an intersection luckily with the light on green and thru that we blast with just one little bump where the road crosses and another bumpwhere the street is dipping downhill again We comedown to the waterfront and screech right In a minutewe 're soaring over the ramps around the Bridge entrance and before I can gulp up a shot or two from my last late bottle we 're already parked back outside the pad onBuchanan The greatest driver in the world whoeverhe was and I never saw him again Bruce something or other What a getaway.  |p86I  END UP GROANING DRUNK ON THE FLOOR this time besideDave 's floor mattress forgetting that he 's not even there . But a strange thing happened that morning I remember now : before Cody 's call from downvalley : I 'm feeling hopelessly idiotically depressed again groaning to rememberTyke 's dead and remembering that sinking beach but at the side of the radiator in the toilet lies a copy of Boswell 's Johnson which we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any page then one more page and start reading from the top left and suddenly I 'm in an entirely perfect world again : old Doc Johnson and Boswell are visiting a castle in Scotland belonging to a deceased friend called Rorie More , they 're drinking sherry by the great fireplace looking at the picture of Rorie on the wall , the widow of Rorie is there , Johnson suddenly says " Sir , here 's what I would do to deal with the sword of Rorie More " ( the portrait shows old Rorie with his Highlands flinger ) " I 'd get inside him with a dirk and stab him top87my pleasure like an animal " and bleary with hangover I realize that if there was any way for Johnson to express his sorrow to the widow of Rorie More on the unfortunatecircumstance of his death , this was the way So pitiful , irrational , yet perfect I rush down to the kitchenwhere Dave Wain and some others are already eating breakfast of sorts and start reading the whole thing to thelot of them Jonesy looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the morning but I 'm notbeing literary at all Again I see death , the death ofRorie More , but Johnson 's response to death is ideal and so ideal I only wish old Johnson be sitting in the kitchennow ( Help ! I 'm thinking ) . The call comes from Cody in Los Gatos that he losthis job tire recapping " Because we were there lastnight ? " " No no something entirely different , he 's gottalay off some men because his mortgage is bleeding him and all that and some girl is tryna sue him for forging a check and all that , so man I 've got to find another job but I have to pay the rent and everything 's all fucked up down here , Oh old buddy how about , cant you , I plead or I do nt plead , or honestly , Jack , ah , lend me a hundreddollars willya ? " " By God Cody I 'll be right down andGIVE you a hundred dollars " " You mean you 'll reallydo that , listen just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hm " ( fluttering his eyelashes over the phone because he knows I mean it ) " you old loverboy you , how you gon na get down here there and give me that moneythere son and make my old heart glad " " I 'll have Davedrive me down " " Okay I 'll pay the rent with it right away and because it 's now Friday , why , Thursday or whatever , that 's right Thursday , why I do nt have to bep88lookin for a new job till next Monday so you can stay here and we 'll have a long weekend just goofin and talkin boy like we used to do , I can demolish you at chess or we can watch a baseball game " and in a whisper " and we can sneak into the City see and see my purty baby " So I ask Dave Wain and yes he 's ready to go anytime , he 's just following me like I often follow people myself , and so off we go again . And on the way we drop in on Monsanto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave and me and Cody to go to the cabin and spend a big quiet crazy weekend ( how ? ) but when Monsanto hears this idea he 'll come too , in fact he 'll bring his little Chinese buddy Arthur Ma and we 'll catch McLear at Santa Cruz and go visit Henry Miller and suddenly another big huge ball is begun . So there 's Willie waiting down on the street , I go to the store , buy the bottle , Dave wheels Willie around , Ron Blake and now Ben Fagan are on the back mattress , I 'm sitting in my front seat rocking chair as now in broad afternoon we go blattin again down that Bay Shore highway to see old Cody and Monsanto 's in back of us in his jeep with Arthur Ma , two jeeps now , and about to be two more as I 'll show Coming to Cody 's in midafternoon , his own house already filled with visitors ( local Los Gatos literaries and all kinds of people the phone there ringing continually too ) and Cody says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days with Jack and the ganglike the old days and look for a job Monday " " Okay " So we all go to a wonderful pizza restaurant in LosGatos where the pizzas are piled an inch high with mushroomsand meat and anchovies or anything you want , Ip89cash a travelers check at the supermarket , Cody takes the 100 in cash , gives it to Evelyn in the restaurant , and later that day the two jeeps resume down to Monterey and down that blasted road I walked on blistered feet back to the frightful bridge at Raton Canyon And I 'd thought I 'd never see the place again . But now I was coming back loaded with observers . The sight of the canyondown there as we renegotiated the mountain road made me bite my lip with marvel and sadness.  |p90IT  'S AS FAMILIAR AS AN OLD FACE IN AN OLD PHOTOGRAPHas tho I 'm gone a million years from all that sun shaded brush on rocks and that heartless blue of the sea washing white on yellow sand , those rills of yellow arroyo running down mighty cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaning upheaval so strange to see after the last several days of just looking at little faces and mouths of people As tho nature hada Gargantuan leprous face of its own with broad nostrils and huge bags under its eyes and a mouth big enough to swallow five thousand jeepster stationwagons and ten thousand Dave Wains and Cody Pomerays without a sighof reminiscence or regret There it is , every sad contourof my valley , the gaps , the Mien Mo captop mountain again , the dreaming woods below our high shelved road , suddenly indeed the sight of poor Alf again far waygrazing in the mid afternoon by the corral fence And there 's the creek bouncing along as tho nothing hadp91ever happened elsewhere and even in the daytime somehowdark and hungry looking in its deeper tangled grass . Cody 's never seen this country before altho he 's an old Californian by now , I can see he 's very impressed and even glad he 's come out on a little jaunt with the boys and with me and is seeing a grand sight He 's like alittle boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like let out of school , no job , the bills paid , nothing to do but gratefully amuse me , his eyes are shining Infact ever since he 's come out of San Quentin there 's been something hauntedly boyish about him as tho prison wallshad taken all the adult dark tenseness out of him Infact every evening after supper in the cell he shared with the quiet gunman he 'd bent his serious head to a daily letter or at least every-other-day letter full of philosophicaland religious musings to his mistress Billie And whenyou 're in bed in jail after lights out and you 're not sleepy there 's ample time to just remember the world and indeedsavor its sweetness if any ( altho it 's always sweet to remember it in jail tho harder in prison , as Genet shows ) with the result that he 'd not only come to a chastisement of his bashing bitternesses ( and of course it 's always good to get away from alcohol and excessive smoking for two years ) ( and all that regular sleep ) he was just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidlikeness I think allex cons seem to have when they 've just come out Inseeking to severely penalize criminals society by putting the criminals away behind safe walls actually provide them with the means of greater strength for future atrocitiesglorious and otherwise " Well I 'll be damned " he keeps saying as he sees those bluffs and cliffs and hanging vines and dead trees , " you mean to tell me youp92ben alone here for three weeks , why I wouldnt dare that ... must be awful at night . . . looka that old mule down there . . . man , dig the redwood country way back in .. . reminds me of old Colorady b'god when I used to steal a car every day and drive out to hills like this with a fresh little high school sumptin " " Yum Yum , " says Dave Wain emphatically turning that big goofy look to us from his driving wheel with his big mad feverishshining eyes full of yumyum and yabyum too " S'matterwith you boys not making extensive plans to bring a bevy of schoolgirls down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed and talking sadly . Behind us the Monsanto jeepster follows doggedly Passing thru Monterey Monsanto has already called Pat McLear , staying for the summer with wife and kid in Santa Cruz , McLear whith his own jeepster is following usa few miles down the highway It 's a big Big Sur day . We wheel downhill to cross the creek and at the corral fence I proudly get out to officially open the gate and letthe cars through We go bumping down the two-ruttedlane to the cabin and park My heart sinks to seethe cabin . To see the cabin so sad and almost human waiting there for me as if forever , to hear my little neat gurgling creek resuming its song just for me , to see the very same bluejaysstill waiting in the tree for me and maybe mad at me now they see I 'm back because I havent been there to lay out their Cheerios along the porch rail every blessed morning And in fact first thing I do is rush inside and getthem some food and lay it out But so many peoplearound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decked out in his old clothes and lookingp93forward to a wine and talkfest weekend in his pleasant cabin takes the big sweet axe down from the wall nails and goes out and starts hammering at a huge log Infact it 's really a half of a tree that fell there years ago and 's been hammered at intermittently but now he 's bound he 's going to crack it in half and again in half so we can then start splitting it down the middle for hugebonfire type logs Meanwhile little Arthur Ma whonever goes anywhere without his drawing paper and his Yellowjack felt tip pencils is already seated in my chair on the porch ( wearing my hat now too ) drawing one of his interminable pictures , he 'll do 25 a day and 25 thenext day too  --  He 'll talk and go on drawing He hasfelt tips of all colors , red , blue , yellow , green , black , he draws marvelous subconscious glurbs and can also do excellent objective scenes or anything he wants on tocartoons Dave is taking my rucksack and his rucksackout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fagan is wandering around near the creek puffing on his pipe with a happy bhikku smile , Ron Blake is unpackingthe steaks we bought enroute in Monterey and I 'm already flicking the plastics off the top of bottles with that expert twitch and twist you only get to learn after years of winoing in alleys east and west . Still the same , the fog is blowing over the walls of the canyon obscuring the sun but the sun keeps fighting back  --  The inside of the cabin with the fire finally going is still the dear lovable abode now as sharp in my mind as I look at it as an unusually well focused snapshot The sprig of ferns still stands in a glass of water , the books are there , the neat groceries ranged along the wallshelves I feel excited to be with the gang but there'sp94a hidden sadness too and which is expressed later by Monsanto when he says " This is the kind of place where a person should really be alone , you know ? when you bring a big gang here it somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody in particular ? there 's such a sad sweetness to those trees as tho yells shouldnt insult them or conversation only " Which is just the way Ifeel too . In a gang we all go down the path towards the sea , passing underneath " That sonofabitch bridge " Cody callsit looking up with horror " That thing 's enough to scareanybody away " But worst of all for an old driver likeCody , and Dave too , is to see that upended old chassis in the sand , they spend a half hour poking around thewreckage and shaking their heads We kick around thebeach awhile and decide to come back at night with bottlesand flashlights and build a huge bonfire , now it 's time to get back to the cabin and cook those steaks and have a ball , and there 's McLear 's jeep already arrived and parked and there 's McLear himself and that beautiful blonde wife of his in her tight blue jeans that makes Dave say " Yum yum " and Cody just say " Yes , that 's right , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p95A  ROARING DRINKING BOUT BEGINS deep in the canyon Fog nightfall sends cold seeping into the windows so all these softies demand that the wood windows be closed so we all sit there in the glow of the one lamp coughing in the smoke but they do nt care They think it 's justthe steaks smoking over the fire -- I have one of the jugsin my hand and I wont let go McLear is the handsome young poet who 's just written the most fantastic poem in America , called " Dark Brown , " which is every detail of his and his wife 's body described in ecstatic union and communion and inside out and everywhichaway and notonly that he insists on reading it to us But I wantaread my " Sea " poem too But Cody and Dave Wainare talking about something else and that silly kid RonBlake is singing like Chet Baker Arthur Ma is drawing in the corner , and it sorta goes like this generally : " That 's what old men do , Cody , they drive slowly backwards in Safeway Supermarket parking lots "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bicycle of mine but that 's what they do yes you see that 's because while the old woman is shoppin in that store they figure they 'll park a little closer to the entrance and so they spend a half hour to think their big move out and they back in out slowly from their slot , can hardly turn around to see what 's in back , usually nothin there , then they wheel real slow and trembly to that slot they picked but all of a sudden some cat jumps in it with his pickup and them old men is scratchin their heads sayin and whining Owww , these young fellers nowadays ' and all that obvious , ah , yes , but that BICYCLE of mine in DenverI tell you I had it twisted and that wheel used to wobble so by necissity I had to invent a new way to maneuver them handlebars see " Hey Cody have a drink , " I 'm yelling in his ear and meanwhile McLear is reading : " Kiss my thighs in darkness the pit of fire " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crazy character comes down stairs and asking for a copy of Alisteir Crowley and I did nt know ' bout that till you told me the other day , then on the way out I see him sneak a book off the shelf but he puts another one in its place that he got out of his pocket , and the books is a novel by somebody called Denton Welch all about this young kid in China wanderin around the streets like real romantic young Truman Capote only it 's China " and Arthur Ma suddenly yells : " Hold still you buncha bastards , I got a hole in my eye " and generally the way parties go , and so on , ending with the steak dinner ( I do nt even touch a bite but just drink on ) , then the big bonfire on the beach to which we march all in one armswinginggang , I 've gotten the idea in my head I 'm thep97leader of a guerilla warfare unit and I 'm marching ahead the lieutenant giving orders , with all our flashlights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hup one two three " and challenging the enemy to come out of hiding , some guerillas . Monsanto that old woodsman starts a huge bonfire on the beach that can be seen flaring from miles away , cars passing across the bridge way up there can see there 's a party goin on in the hole of night , in fact the bonfire lights up the eerie weird beams and staunches of the bridge almost all the way up , giant shadows dance on the rocks The sea swirls up but seems subdued It 's notlike being alone down in the vast hell writing the sounds of the sea . The night ending with everybody passing out exhaustedon cots , in sleepingbags outside ( McLear goes home with wife ) but Arthur Ma and I by the late fire keep up yelling spontaneous questions and answers right till dawn like " Who told you you had a hat on your head ? " " My head never questions hats " " What 's the matter with your liver training ? " " My liver training gotinvolved in kidney work "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , an eastcoaster who 's never known Chinese or Japanese kids , on the west coast it 's quite common but for an eastcoaster like me it 's amazingand what with all my earlier studies in Zen and Chanand Tao ) ( And Arthur also being a gentle small softhairedseemingly soft little Oriental goofnik ) And wecome to great chanted statements , taking turns , without a pause to think , just one then the other , bing and bang , the beauty of them being that while one guy is yelling like ( me ) : - " Tonight the full apogee August moon willp98out , early with a jaundiced tint , and pop angels all over my rooftop along with Devas sprinkling flowers " ( any kind of nonsense being the rule ) the other guy has time not only to figure the next statement but can take off from the subconscious arousement of an idea from " angels all over my rooftop " and so can yell without thinking an answer the stupider or rather the more unexpectedly insanersillier brighter it is the better " Pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with omnipotent youths bearing monkey women that will stomp through the stage waiting for the moment when by pinching myself I prove that a thought is like a touch " But this is only the beginning because now we know the routine and get better and better till at dawn I seem to recall we were so fantastically brilliant ( while everyone snored ) the skies must have shook to hear it and not just foil : let 's see if I can recreate at least the style of this game : - ARTHUR : " When are you going to become the Eighth Patriarch ?

"  |p103INCIDENTALLY  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars had not come out at all , not even for one minute on any night , it was the foggy season , except the very last night when I was getting ready to leave Now the stars were out every night , the sunshone considerably longer but a sinister wind accompaniedthe Autumn in Big Sur : it seemed like the whole Pacific Ocean was blowing with all its might right into Raton Canyon and also over the high gap from another end causing all the trees to shudder as the big groaning howl came newsing and noising from downcanyon , whenit hit there was raised a roar of noise I did nt like Itseemed ill omened to me somewhere It was muchbetter to have fog and silence and quiet trees Nowthe whole canyon by one blast could be led screaming and waving in all directions in such a confused mass that even the fellows with me were a little surprised to seeit It was too big a wind for such a little canyon.  |p104This  development also prevented the constant hearing of the reassuring creek . One good thing was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersed the clap of empty thunder they caused , because during the foggy season the noise would come down into the canyon , concentratethere , and rock the house like an explosion making me think the first time ( alone ) that somebody 'd set off a blast of dynamite nearby . While I woke up groaning and sick there was plenty of wine right there to start me off with the hounds of hair , so okay , but Monsanto had retired early and typically sensibly to sleep by the creek and now he was awake singing swooshing his whole head into the creek and going Brrrrr and rubbing his hands for a new day Dave Wain made breakfast with his usual lecture " Now the real way to fry eggs is to put a cover over them so that they can have that neat basted white look on the yellows , soon 's I get this pancake batter ready we 'll start on them " My list of groceries was so all inclusive in the beginningit was now feeding guerilla troops . A big axe chopping contest began after breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performers down below hacking away at the tree trunk which wasover a foot thick They were chopping off two footchunks , no easy job I realized you can always studythe character of a man by the way he chops wood Monsanto an old lumberman up in Maine as I say now showed us how he conducted his whole life in fact by the way he took neat little short handled chops from both left and right angles getting his work done in reasonablyshort time without too much sweat But his strokesp105were rapid Whereas old Fagan pipe-in-mouth sloggedaway I guess the way he learned in Oregon and in the Northwest fire schools , also getting his job done , silently , not a word- But Cody 's fantastic fiery character showed in the way he went at the log with horrible force , when he brought down the axe with all his might and holding it far at the end you could hear the whole treetrunkgroaning the whole length inside , runk , sometimes you could hear a lengthwise cracking going on , he is really very strong and he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hit He chopped off his log withthe fury of a Greek god Nevertheless it took himlonger and much more sweat than Monsanto " Used to do this in a workgang in southern Arizony " he said , whopping one down that made the whole treetrunk danceoff the ground But it was like an example of vast butsenseless strength , a picture of poor Cody 's life and in asense my own I too chopped with all my might andgot madder and went faster and raked the log but tookmore time than Monsanto who watched us smiling Little Arthur thereupon tried his luck but gave up afterfive strokes The axe was like to carry him away anyway Then Dave Wain demonstrated with big easystrokes and in no time we had five huge logs to use But now it was time to get in the cars ( McLear had rearrived ) and go driving south down the coast highway to a hot springs bath house down there , which sounded good to me at first . But the new Big Sun Autumn was now all winey sparklingblue which made the terribleness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its gruesome splendor , miles and miles of it snaking away south , ourp106three jeeps twisting and turning the increasing curves , sheer drops at our sides , further ghostly high bridges to cross with smashings below Tho all the boys are wowingto see it To me it 's just an inhospitable madhouseof the earth , I 've seen it enough and even swallowed itin that deep breath The boys reassure me the hot springs bath will do me good ( they see I 'm gloomy now hungover for good ) but when we arrive my heart sinks again as McLear points out to sea from the balcony of the outdoor pools : " Look out there floating in the sea weeds , a dead otter ! " And sure enough it is a dead otter I guess , a big brown pale lump floating up and down mournfullywith the swells and ghastly weeds , my otter , my dearotter I 'd written poems about " Why did he die ? " Iask myself in despair " Why do they do that ? " " What 's the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to get a better look at the big peaceful tortured hunk of seacow out there as tho it 's something of passing interest while to me it 's a blow across the eyesand down into my heart The hot water pools aresteaming , Fagan and Monsanto and the others are all sittingpeacefully up to their necks , they 're all naked , but there 's a gang of fairies also there naked all standing around in various bath house postures that make me hesitate to take my clothes off just on general principles In fact Cody does nt even bother to do anything but lie down with his clothes on in the sun , on the balcony table , and just smoke But I borrow McLear 's yellow bathingsuitand get in " What ya wearing a bathingsuit ina hot springs pool for boy ?

From the baths we go to Nepenthe which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with excellent food , excellent waiters and management , good drinks , chess tables , chairs and tables to just sit in the sun and look at the grand coast Here we all sit at varioustables and Cody starts playing chess with everybody will join while he 's chomping away at those marvelous hamburgerscalled Heavenburgers ( huge with all the sideworks ) Cody does nt like to just sit around and lightlychat away , he 's the kind of guy if he 's going to talk he has to do all the talking himself for hours till everythingp108is exhaustedly explained , sans that he just wants to bend over a chessboard and say " He he heh , old Scrooge is savingup a pawn hey ? cak ! I got ya ! " But while I'msitting there discussing literature with McLear and Monsantosuddenly a strange couple of gentlemen nearby strike up an acquaintance  --  One of them is a youngsterwho says he is a lieutenant in the Army I instantly ( drunk on fifth Manhattan by now ) go into my theory of guerilla warfare based on my observations the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsanto , Arthur , Cody , Dave , Ben , Ron Blake and I were all members of one fighting unit ( and all carrying canteens of booze on our belts ) it would be very difficult for the enemy to hurt any of us because we 'd be , as dear friends , watching so desperately closely over one another , which I tell the first lieutenant , which attracts the interest of the older man who admits that he 's a GENERAL in theArmy There are also some further homosexuals at aseparate table which prompts Dave Wain to look up from the chess game at one quiet drowsy point and announce in his dry twang " Under redwood beams , people talking about homosexuality and war . . . call it my NepentheHaiku " " Yass " says Cody checkmating him " see what you can ku about that m'boy and get out of there and I 'll noose you with my queen , dear . " I mention the general only because there are also somethingsinister about the fact that during this long binge I came across him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never met any generals in my life Thisfirst general was strange because he seemed too polite and yet there was something sinister about his steely eyesbehind goof darkglasses Something sinister too aboutthe first lieutenant who guessed who we were ( the Sanp109Francisco poets , a major nucleus of them indeed ) and did n't seem at all pleased tho the general seemed amusedNevertheless in a sinister way the general seemed to take great interest in my theory about buddy units for guerilla warfare and when President Kennedy about a year later ordered just such a new scheme for part of our armed forces I wondered ( still crazy even then but for new reasons ) if the general had got an idea from me The second general , even stranger , coming up , occurred when I was even more far gone . Manhattans and more Manhattans and finally when we got back to the cabin in late afternoon I was feeling good but realized I was going to be finished tomorrow But poor young Ron Blake asked me if he could stay with me in the cabin , the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , I couldnt think of any way to reject hisrequest in a harmless way so said yes So when theyall left suddenly I was alone with this mad beatnik kidsinging me songs and all I wanta do is sleep But I'vegot to make the best of it and not disappoint his believingheart . Because after all the poor kid actually believes that there 's something noble and idealistic and kind about all this beat stuff , and I 'm supposed to be the King of the Beatniks according to the newspapers , so but at the same time I 'm sick and tired of all the endless enthusiasms of new young kids trying to know me and pour out all their lives into me so that I 'll jump up and down and say yes yes that 's right , which I cant do any more My reason for coming to Big Sur for the summer being precisely toget away from that sort of thing Like those patheticfive highschool kids who all came to my door in Long Island one night wearing jackets that said " Dharma Bums "  |p110on  them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mistake on a book jacket and here I am old enough to be their father But no , hep swinging young jazzy Ron wants to dig everything , go to the beach , run and romp and sing , talk , write tunes , write stories , climb mountains , go hiking , see everything , do everything with everybody But having one last quart of port with me I agree tofollow him to the beach . We go down the old sad path of the bhikku and suddenly I see a dead mouse in the grass " A wee dead mousie " I say cleverly poetically but suddenly I realize and remember now for the first time how I 've left the cover off the rat poison in Monsanto 's shelf and so this ismy mouse It 's lying there dead Like the otter inthe sea It 's my own personal mouse that I 've carefully fed chocolate and cheese all summer but once again I 've unconsciously sabotaged all these great plans of mine to be kind to living beings even bugs , once again I 've murdereda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we come to the place where the garter snake usually lies sunning itself , and I bring it to Ron 's attention , he suddenly yells " LOOKOUT ! you never can tell what kind of snake it is ! " which really scares me , my heartpounds with horror My little friend the garter snaketurns therefore with my head from a living being with a long green body into the evil serpent of Big Sur . On top of that , at the surf , where long streamers of hollow sea weed always lie around drying in the sun some of them huge , like living bodies with skin , pieces of living material that always made me sad somehow , here 's the young hepcat lifting them up and dancing a dervish around the beach with them , turning my Sur into somethingseachange Something brainchange.  |p111All  that night by lamplight we sing and yell songs which is okay but in the morning the bottle is gone and I wake up with the " final horrors " again , precisely the way I woke up in the Frisco skidrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with me again , I can hear myself again whining " Why does God torture me ? " - But anybody who 's never had delirium tremens even in their early stages may not understand that it 's not so much a physical pain but a mental anguish indescribable to those ignorant people who do nt drink and accuse drinkers of irresponsibility Themental anguish is so intense that you feelyou have betrayed your very birth , the efforts nay the birth pangs of your mother when she bore you and deliveredyou to the world , you 've betrayed every effort your father ever made to feed you and raise you and make you strong and my God even educate you for " life , " you feel a guilt so deep you identify yourself with the devil and God seems far away abandoning you to your sick sillinessYou feel sick in the greatest sense of the word , breathing without believing in it , sicksicksick , your soul groans , you look at your helpless hands as tho they were on fire and you cant move to help , you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face an expression of incalculable repining like a constipated angel on a cloud In factit 's actually a cancerous look you throw on the world , through browngray wool fuds over your eyes Your tongue is white and disgusting , your teeth are stained , your hair seems to have dried out overnight , there are huge mucks in the corners of your eyes , greases on your nose , froth at the sides of your mouth : in short that very disgusting and wellknown hideousness everybody knows who 's walked past a city street drunk in the Boweries ofthe world But there 's no joy at all , people say " Ohp112well he 's drunk and happy let him sleep it off " Thepoor drunkard is crying He 's crying for his motherand father and great brother and great friend , he 's cryingfor help He tries to pull himself together by movingone shoe nearer to his foot and he cant even do that properly , he 'll drop the shoe , or knock something over , he'lldo something invariably that 'll start him crying again He 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knows there is none Not only because he does nt deserve it but there 's no such thing anyway Because he looks up at the blue sky and there 's nothingthere but empty space making a big face at him Helooks at the world , it 's sticking its tongue out at him and once that mask is removed it 's looking at him with hollowbig red eyes like his own eyes He may see theearth move but there 's no significance of any particularkind to attach to that One little unexpected noise behind him will make him snarl in rage He 'll pull andtug at his poor stained shirt He feels like rubbing hisface into something that isnt . His socks are thick tired moisty slimes The beard onhis cheeks itches the running sweats and annoys the torturedmouth There 's a twisted feeling of no-more , never-again , agh What was beautiful and clean yesterdayhas irrationally and unaccountably changed into a bigdreary crock of shit The hairs on his fingers stare athim like tomb hairs The shirt and trousers have becomeglued to his person as tho he was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody waspushing it in from above The pretty white clouds inthe sky hurt his eyes only The only thing to do is turnover and lie face down and weep The mouth is sop113blasted there 's not even a chance to gnash the teeth There 's not even strength to tear the hair . And here comes Ron Blake starting off his new day singingat the top of his voice I go down by the creek andthrow myself in the sand and lie looking with sad eyes at the water which no longer friends me but sorta wants meto go away There isnt a drop to drink left in the cabin , all the goddamn jeeps are gone with all its healthy cargo of people and I 'm alone with an enthusiastic kid on alark The little bugs I 'd saved from drowning just because I was bemused and alone and glad , now drownunnoticed within my reach anyway The spider is stillminding his own business in the outhouse Alf lowsmournfully in the valley far away to express just the way I feel The bluejays yak around me as tho because I'mtoo tired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying me if they can , " They 're friggin vulturesanyway " I moan with my mouth in the sand The once pleasant thumpthump gurgle slap of the creek is now an endless jabbering of blind nature which does nt understand anything in the first place My old thoughtsabout the slit of a billion years covering all this and all cities and generations eventually is just a dumb old thought , " Only a silly sober fool could think it , imagine gloating over such nonsense " ( because in one sense the drinker learns wisdom , in the words of Goethe or Blake or whichever it was " The pathway to wisdom lies throughexcess " ) But in this condition you can only say " Wisdomis just another way to make people sick " " I'mSICK " I yell emphatically to the trees , to the woods around , to the hills above , looking around desperately , nobody cares I can even hear Ron singing at his lunchinside.  |p114What  's even more horrible he tries to show compunctionand wants to help me , " Anything I can do " Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabin and lie on the cot and spend about two hours groaning out a lament : " 0 mon Dieux , pourguoi Tu m'laisse faire malade commeca Papa Papa aide mite Aw /'ai mal au coeurJ'envie d'aller a toilette ' pi ca m'interesse pas Aw ' shumalade Owaowaowao " ( I go into a long " awaowaowoa " that I guess lasted a whole minute ) I tossover and find new reasons to groan I think I 'm aloneand I 'm letting it all go a whole lot like I 'd heard my father do when he was dying of cancer in the night in thebed next to mine When I do manage to stagger upand go lean on the door I realize with double upon double horror that Ron Blake has been sitting there all this timelistening to everything over a book ( I wonder nowwhat he told people about this later , it must have soundedhorrible ) ( Idiotic too , cretinous even , maybe onlyFrench Canadian who knows ? ) " Ron I 'm sorry youhad to hear all that , I 'm sick " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to sleep " " I cant sleep ! " I yell in arage I feel like yelling " Fuck yourself you little idiotwhat do you know what Im going through ! " but then I realize how oldman disgusting and hopeless all that is , and here he is enjoying his big weekend with the big writer he was supposed to tell all his friends what a greatswinging ball it was and what I did and said But methinksand mayhap he took away a lesson in temperance , or a lesson in beatness really Because the only time I'veever been sicker and madder was a week later when Dave and I came back with the two girls leading to the final horrible night.  |p115BUT  LOOK AT THIS : in the afternoon restless youngster Ron wants to go hitch hiking to Monterey of all things to go see McLear and I say " Okay go ahead " " Ai nt youcoming with me ? " he asks surprised to see the champion on-the-roader wont even hitch hike any more , " No I 'll stayhere and get better I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he 's gone and has yelled one final hoot from the canyon road directly above and gone on , and I 've sat in the sun alone on the porch , fed my birds finally again , washed my socks and shirt and pants and hung them up to dry on bushes , slurped up tons of water kneeling at the creek race , stared silently at the trees , soon as the sun goes down I swear on my arm I 'm as well as I ever was : just like that suddenly . " Can it be that Ron and all these other guys , Dave and McLear or somebody , the other guys earlier are all a big bunch of witches out to make me go mad ? " I seriously consider this Remembering that childhood revery Ip116always had , which I used to ponder seriously as I walked home from St. Joseph 's Parochial School or sat in the parlor of my home , that everybody in the world is making fun of money me and I do nt know it because everytime I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into place with regular expressions , but soon 's I look away again they dart up to my nape of neck and all whisper there giggling and plotting evil , silently , you cant hear them , and when I turn quickly to catch them they 've already snapped back perfectly in place and are saying " Now the proper way to cook eggs is " or they 're singing Chet Baker songs looking the other way or they 're saying " Did I ever tell you about Jim that time ? " But my childhood revery also included the fact that everybody in the world was making this fun of me because they were all members of an eternal secret society or Heaven society that knew the secret of the world and were seriously foolingme so I 'd wake up and see the light ( i.e. , become enlightened , in fact ) So that I , " Ti Jean , " was the LASTTi Jean left in the world , the last poor holy fool , those people at my neck were the devils of the earth among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tho I was the last Jesus in fact ! and all these people were waiting for me to realize it and wake up and catch them peeking andwe 'd all laugh in Heaven suddenly But animals werentdoing that behind my back , my cats were always adornmentslicking their paws sadly , and Jesus , he was a sadwitness to this , somewhat like the animals He wasntpeeking down my neck There lies the root of my belief in Jesus So that actually the only reality in theworld was Jesus and the lambs ( the animals ) and mybrother Gerard who had instructed me Meanwhilep117some of the peekers were kindly and sad , like my father , but had to go along with everybody else in the same boatBut my waking up would take place and then everythingwould vanish except Heaven , which is God Andthat was why later in life after these rather strange you must admit childhood reveries , after I had that fainting vision of the Golden Eternity and others before and after it including Samadhis during Buddhist meditations in the woods , I conceived of myself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell everybody or show everybody by example that their peeking society was actually the Satanic Society and they were all on the wrong track . With all this in my background , now at the point of adulthood disaster of the soul , through excessive drinking , all this was easily converted into a fantasy that everybody in the world was witching me to madness : and I must have believed it subconsciously because as I say as soon as Ron Blake left I was well again and in fact content . In fact very contented I rose that following morning with more joy and health and purpose than ever , and there was me old Big Sur Valley all mine again , here came good old Alf and I gave him food and patted his big rough neck with its various cocotte 's manes , there was the mountain of Mien Mo in the distance just a dismal old hill with funny bushes around the sides and a peaceful farm on top , and nothing to do all day but amuse myself undisturbed by witches and booze And I 'm singing ditties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the color of mysoul , is interpole " and such silly stuff And I yell " IfArthur Ma is a witch he sure is a funny witch ! har har ! " And there 's the bluejay idiot with one foot on the barp118of soap on the porch rail , pecking at the soap and eating it , leaving the cereal unattended , and when I laugh and yell at him he looks up cute with an expression that seems to say " What 's the matter ? wotti do wong ? " " Wo wo , got the wong place , " said another bluejay landing nearbyand suddenly leaving again And everything of my lifeseems beautiful again , I even start remembering the nutty things of the binge and go back even farther and remembernutty things all through my life , it 's just amazing how inside our own souls we can lift out so much strength I think it would be enough strength to move mountains at that , to lift our boots up again and go clomping along happy out of nothing but the good source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does nt scareme anymore , I just sing out " Seventy thousand schemers in the sea " and go back to my cabin and just quietly pour my coffee in the cup , afternoon , how pleasant ! I make a wood run , axe and yank logs outa everywhichawhereand leave em by the side of the road to leisurelycarry home I investigate a cabin down the creek thathas 15 wood matches in it for my emergency Take ashot of sherry , hate it Find an old San Francis Chroniclewith my name in it all over Hack a giant redwoodlog in half in the middle of the creek That kind of day , perfect , ending up sewing my holy sweater singing " There 's no place like home " remembering my motherI even plunge into all the books and magazines around , I read up on ' Pataphysics and yell contemptuouslyin the lamplight " ' T'sa'n intellectual excuse for facetious joking , " throwing the magazine away , adding " Peculiarly attractive to certain shallow types " ThenI turn my rumbling attention to a couple of unknown Finp119du Siecle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap after supper and dream of the U.S. Navy , a ship anchored near a war scene , at an island , but everything is drowsy as two sailors go up the trail with fishingpolesand a dog between them to go make love quietly in the hills : the captain and everybody know they 're queer and rather than being infuriated however they 're all drowsily enchanted by such gentle love : you see a sailor peeking after them with binoculars from the poop : there 's supposed to be a war but nothing happens , just laundry .. . I wake up from this silly but strangely pretty dream feeling exhilirated Besides now the stars come outevery night and I go out on that porch and sit in the old canvas chair and turn my face up to all that mooching going on up there , starmooched firmament , all those stars crying with happy sadness , all that ream and cream of mocky ways with alleyways of lightyears old as DameMae Whitty and the hills I go walking towards MienMo mountain in the moon illuminated August night , see gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do nt have to torture your consciousness with endless thinking " so I sit in the sand and look inwardand see those old roses of the unborn again Amazing , and in just a few hours this change And I have enoughphysical energy to walk back to the sea suddenly realizingwhat a beautiful oriental silk scroll painting this whole canyon would make , those scrolls you open slowly at one end and keep unrolling and unrolling as the valley unfolds towards sudden cliffs , sudden Bodhisattvas sitting alone in lamplit huts , sudden creeks , rocks , trees , then sudden white sand , sudden sea , out to sea and you 've reached thep120end of the scroll And with all those misty rose darknessesof varying tint and tuckaway shades to express theactual ephemerality of night One long roll unfurlingfrom the range fence among the misty hills , moon meadows , even the hay rick near the creek , down to the trail , the narrowing creek , then the mystery of the AW SEA So I investigate the scroll of the valley but I 'm singing " Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts about everything , do nt amount to shit . " In fact back at the cabin to make my bedtime hot Ovaltine I even sing " Sweet Sixteen " like an angel ( by God bettern Ron Blake ) and all the old memories of Ma and Pa , the upright piano in old Massachusetts , the old summernight sings That 's how I go to sleep , under thestars on the porch , and at dawn I turn over with a blissfulsmile on my face because the owls are callin and answering from two different huge dead trunks across the valley , hoo hoo hoo . So maybe it 's true what Milarepa says : " Though you youngsters of the new generation dwell in towns infested with deceitful fate , the link of truth still remains " ( and said this in 890 ! ) " When you remain in solitude , do not think of the amusements in the town . . . You should turn your mind inwardly , and then you 'll find your way .. . The wealth I found is the inexhaustible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bliss of perpetual Voidness . . . Here in the place of Yolmo Tag Pug Senge Dzon , the tigress howling with a pathetic trembling voice reminds me that her piteous cubs are playing lively . . . Like a madman I have no pretension and no hope ... I am telling you the honest truth . . . These are the crazy words of mine ... oh you innumerable motherlike beings , by thep121force of imaginary destiny you see a myriad visions and experience endless emotions . . . I smile . . . To a Yogi , everything is fine and splendid ! In the goodly quietof this Self-Benefitting sky Enclosure , the timely sounds I hear are all my fellows ' sounds . . . At such a pleasant place , in solitude , I , Milarepa , happily remain , meditating upon the void-illuminating mind The more Ups and Downsthe more Joy I feel The greater the fear , the greaterthe happiness I feel . . . "  |p122BUT  IN THE MORNING ( and I 'm no Milarepa who could also sit naked in the snow and was seen flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat McLear and Pat 's wife the beautiful one , and by God their little sweet 5 year old girl who is such a pleasant sight to see as she goes jongling and jiggling through the fields to look for flowers , everything to her is perfectly new beautiful primordialGarden of Eden morning here in this torturedhuman canyon And a rather beautiful morning developsThere 's fog so we close the blinds and light the fire and the lamp , me and Pat , and sit there drinking from the jug he brought talking about literature and poetry while his wife listens and occasionally gets up to heat more coffee and tea or goes out to play with Ronand the little girl Pat and I are in a serious talkativemood and I feel that lonely shiver in my chest which always warns me : you actually love people and you 're glad Pat is here.  |p123Pat  is one if not THE most handsome man I 've ever seen Strange that he 's announced in a preface to his poems that his heroes , his Triumvirate , are Jean Harlow , Rimbaud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy the Kid in the movies , that same darkhaired handsome slightly sliteyed look you expect from the myth appearance of Billy the Kid ( I suppose not the actual real life William Bonnie who 's said to 've been a pimply cretin monster ) . So we launch on a big discussion of everything in the comfortable gloom of the cabin by the warm red glow of the girly fire , I 'm wearing dark glasses anyway for fun , Pat says " Well Jack I did nt have a chance to talk to you yesterday or even last year or even ten years ago when I first met you , I remember I was terrified of you and Pomeray when you ran up my steps one night with sticks of tea , you looked like a couple of car thieves or bank robbers And you know a lot of this sneery stuff they'vewritten against us , against San Francisco or beat poetry and writers is because a lot of us do nt LOOK like writers or intellecuals or anything , you and Pomeray I must say look awful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill either " " Man you ought a go to Hollywood and play Billy the Kid " " Man I 'd rather go to Hollywood and playRimbaud " " Well you cant play Jean Harlow " " I'dreally like to just get my Dark Brown ' published in Paris , do you know that when you think it 's possible a word fromyou to Gallimard or Girodias would help " " I du n no " " Do you know that when I read your poems Mexico City Blues I immediately turned around and started writing a brand new way , you enlightened me with that book "  --  " But it 's nothing like what you do , in fact it 's milesp124away , I am a language spinner and you 're idea man " and so on we talk till about noon and Ron 's been in and out , ' s'made jaunts to the beach with the little ladies and Pat and I do nt realize the sun has come out but still sit there deep in the cabin by now talking about Villon and Cervantes . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open with a loud crash and a burst of sunlight illuminates the room and I see an Angel standing arm outstretched in the door ! It 's Cody ! all dressed in his Sunday best in a suit ! beside him are ranged several graduating golden angels from Evelyn golden beautiful wife down to the most dazzling angel of them all little Timmy with the sun striking off his hair in beams ! It 's such an incrediblesight and surprise that both Pat and I rise from our chairs involuntarily , like we 've been lifted up in awe , or scared , tho I do nt feel scared so much as ecstaticallyamazed as tho I 've seen a vision And the way Codystands there not saying a word with his arm outstretched for some reason , struck a pose of some sort to surprise us or warn us , he 's so much like St. Michael at the moment it 's unbelievable especially as I also suddenly realize what he 's just actually done , he 's had wife and kiddies sneak up ever so quiet up the porch steps ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks , easy and tiptoeing , stood there awhile while he prepared to fling the door open , all lined up and stood straight , then pow , he 's opened the door and thrown the golden universe into the dazzled mystic eyes of big hip Pat McLear and big amazed gratefulme It reminds me of the time I once saw a whole tiptoeing gang of couples sneaking into our back kitchen door on West Street in Lowell the leader telling me top125shush as I stand there 9 years old amazed , then all burstingin on my father innocently listening to the Primo Camera-Ernie Schaaft fight on the old 1930 's radio For a big roaring toot But Cody 's oldfashioned family tiptoe sneak carries that strange apocalyptic burst of gold he somehow always manages to produce , like I said elsewherethe time in Mexico he drove an old car over a rutted road very slowly as we were all high on tea and I saw golden Heaven , or the other times he 's always seemed so golden like as I say in a davenport of some sort in Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to produce this effect : he 's just standing there with innate dramatic mystery holding forth his arm as if to say Behold , the sun ! and Behold , the angels ! sorta pointing at all the golden heads of his family and Pat and I stand aghast . " Happy birthday Jack ! " yells Cody or some such ordinarycrazy inane greeting " I 've come to you with good news ! I 've brought Evelyn and Emily and Gaby and Timmy because we 're all so grateful and glad because everything has worked out absolutely dead perfect , or living perfect , boy , with that little old hunnerd dollars you gave me let me tell you the fantastic story of what happened " ( to him it was utterly fantastic ) , " I went out and traded in my Nash that as you know wont even start but I have to have m'old buddies push it down the road for me , this guy had a perfect gem of a purple or what color is it Maw ? magenty , slamelty , a jeepster stationwagonJack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio , a brand new set of backup lights , this a and thata down to the perfect new tires and that wonderfulshiney paint job , that color 'll knock you out , that'sp126what it is , Grape ! " ( as Evelyn murmurs the color ) " Grape color for all the old grape wine jacks , so we 've come here to not only thank you and see you again but to celebrate this , and on top of all that , occasion , goo me I 'm all so gushy and girly , hee hee hee , yes that 's right come on in children and then go out and get that gear in the car and get ready to sleep outdoors tonight and get that good open fresh air , Jack on top of all that and my heart is jess OVERflowin I got a NEW JOB ! ! along with that splissly little old beautiful new jeep ! a new job right downtown in Los Gatos in fact I do nt even have to drive to work any more , I can walk it , just half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet old Pat McLear here , start up some eggs or some of that steak we brought , open up that vieen roossee wine we brought for drunk old Jack that good old boy while I personally private take him to walk with me back down the road where the jeep is parked , unlock that gate , you got the corral key Jack , okay , and we 'll talk and walk just like old times and drive back real slow in my new slowboat to China . " So it 's a whole new day , a whole new situation the way it is with Cody , in fact a whole new universe as suddenly we 're alone again really for the first time in ages walking rapidly down the road to go get the car and he looks at me with that hand-rubbing wicked look like he 's about to spring a surprise on me that 's the top surprise of them all , " You guessed it old buddy I have here the LAST , the absolutely LAST yet most perfect of all blackhaired seeded packed tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now going to light up , ' s'why I did nt want you to bring any of that wine right away , why boy we got time to drink wine and wine and dance " and herep127he is lighting up , says " Now do nt walk too fast , it 's time to stroll along like we used to do remember sometimes on our daysoff on the railroad , or walkin across that Third and Townsend tar like you said and the time we watched the sun go down so perfect holy purple over that Mission cross Yessir , slow and easy , lookin at this gone valley " so we start to puff the pot but as usual it creates doubtful paranoias in both our minds and we actually sort of fall silent on the way to the car which is a beautiful grape color at that , a brand new shiney Jeepster with all the equipments , and the whole golden reunion deteriorates into Cody 's matter-of-fact lecture on why the car is going to be such a honey ( the technical details ) and he even yells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cant wait here all day , hor hor hor . " But that 's not the point , about pot paranoia , yet maybe it is at that I 've long given it up because it bugs meanyway But so we drive back slowly to the shack and Evelyn and Pat 's wife have met and are having woman talk and McLear and I and Cody talk around the table planning excursions with the kids to the beach . And there 's Evelyn and I havent had a chance to talk to her for years either , Oh the old clays when we 'd stay up late by the fireplace as I say discussing Cody 's soul , Cody this and Cody that , you could hear the name Cody ringing under the roofs of America from coast to coast almost to hear his women talking about him , always pronouncing " Cody " with a kind of anguish yet there was girlish squealing pleasure in it , " Cody has to learn to control the enormous forces in him " and Cody " will alwaysmodify his little white lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and according to Irwin Garden Cody'sp128women were always having transcontinental telephone talks about his dong ( which is possible . ) Because he was always tremendously generated towards complete relationship with his women to the point where they ended up in one convoluted octopus mess of souls and tears and fellatio and hotel room schemes and rushingin and out of cars and doors and great crises in the middle of the night , wow that madman you can at least write on his grave someday " He Lived , He Sweated " No halfway house is Cody 's house Tho now as I say sorta sweetly chastised and a little bored at last with the world after the crummy injustice of his arrest and sentence he 's sorta quieted down and where he 'd launch into a tremendousexplanation of every one of his thoughts for the benefit of everybody in the room as he 's putting on his socks and arranging his papers to leave , now he just flips itaside and may make a stale shrug A Jesuit at work Tho I remember one crazy moment in the shack that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuances as though the whole of creation suddenlyexploded and imploded together in one moment : at the moment that Pat 's pretty little angel daughter is coming in to hand me an extremely tiny flower ( " It 's for you , " she says direct to me ) ( for some reason the poor little thing thinks I need a flower , or else her mother instructed her for charming reasons , like adornment ) Cody is furiously explaining to his little son Tim " Never let the right hand know what your left hand is doing " and at that moment I 'm trying to close my palm around the incredibly small flower and it 's so small I cant even do that , cant feel it , cant hardly see it , in fact such a small flower only that little girl could have found it , butp129I look up to Cody as he says that to Tim , and also to impress Evelyn who 's watching me , I announced " Never let the left hand know what the right hand is doing , but this right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up " Yass yass . " So what started as a big holy reunion and surprise party in Heaven deteriorates to a lot of showoff talk , actually , at least on my part , but when I get to drink the wine I feel lighter and we all go down to the beach I walk in front with Evelyn but when we get to the narrowpath I walk in front like an Indian to show her whata big Indian I 've been all summer I 'm bursting to tellher everything " See that grove there , once in a whileyou 'll be surprised out of your shoes to see the mule quietly standing there with locks of hair like Ruth 's over his forehead , a big Biblical mule meditating , or over there , but up here , and look at that bridge , now what doyou think of that ? " All the kids are fascinated by theupsidedown car wreck At one point I 'm sitting in thesand as Cody walks up my way , I say to him him imitatingWallace Beery and scratching my armpits " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last lines of that great movie Twenty Mule Team ) and Cody says " That 's right , if anybody can imitate old Wallace Beery that 's the only way to do it , you had just the right timber there in the tone of your voice there , Cuss a man for dyin in Death Valley hee hee yes " but he rushes off to talk to McLear 's wife . Strange sad desultory the way families and people sorta scatter around a beach and look vaguely at the sea , all disorganized and picnic sad At one point I 'm tellingEvelyn that a tidal wave from Hawaii could very easilyp130come someday and we 'd see it miles away a huge wall of awful water and " Boy it would take some doing to run back and climb up these cliffs , huh ? " but Cody hears this and says , " What ? " and I say " It would wash over us and take us all to Salinas I bet " and Cody says " What ? that brand new jeep ? I 'm goin back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange humor ) . " How'd'st rain rule here ? " says I to Evelyn to show her what a big poet I am She really loves me , used to love me in the old days like a husband , for awhile there she had two husbands Cody and me , we were a perfect family till Cody finally got jealous or maybe I got jealous , it was wild for awhile I 'd be coming home from work on the railroad all dirty with my lamp and just as I came in for my Joy bubblebath old Cody was rushing off on a call so Evelyn had her new husband in the second shift then when Cody come home at dawn all dirty for his Joy bubblebath , ring , the phone 's run and the crew clerk 's asked me out and I 'm rushing off to work , both of ususing the same old clunker car in shifts And Evelynalways maintaining that she and I were really made for each other but her Karma was to serve Cody in this particularlifetime , which I really believe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say " I 'll get you , Jack , in anotherlifetime ... And you 'll be very happy " " What ? " I 'd yellto joke , " me running up the eternal halls of Karma tryinaget away from you hey ? " " It 'll take you eternities toget rid of me , " she adds sadly , which makes me jealous , I want her to say I 'll never get rid of her I wanta bechased for eternity till I catch her . " Ah Jack " she says putting her arm around me on the beach , " it 's nice to see you again , Oh I wish we couldp131be quiet again and just have our suppers of homemade pizza all together and watch T.V. together , you have so many friends and responsibilities now it 's sad , and you get sick drinking and everything , why do nt you just come stay with us awhile and rest " " I will " But Ron Blakeis redhot for Evelyn and keeps coming over to dance with seaweeds and impress her , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time alone with Evelyn , Cody 's said " Go ahead man . " Having run out of liquor in fact Ron does get his opportunity to be alone with Evelyn as Cody and me and the kids in one car , and McLear and family in the other start for Monterey to stock up for the night and also more cigarettes Evelyn and Ron light a bonfire on thebeach to wait for us As we 're driving along littleTimmy says to Paw " We shoulda brought Mommy withus , her pants got wet in the beach " " By now theyoughta be steamin , " says Cody matter-of-factly in another one of his fantastic puns as he lockwallops that awful narrow dirt canyon road like a getaway car in the mountainsin a movie , we leave poor McLear miles back When Cody comes to a narrow tight curve with all our death staring us in the face down that hole he just swerves the curve saying " The way to drive in the mountains is , boy , no fiddlin around , these roads do nt move , you'rethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highwayand go right battin up to Monterey in the Big Sur dusk where down there on the faint gloamy frothing rocks you can hear the seals cry.  |p132MCLEAR  EXHIBITS ANOTHER STRANGE FACET OF HIS HANDSOMEBUT FAINTLY " DECADENT " Rimbaud-type personality at his summer camp by coming out in the livingroom with a goddamn HAWK on his shoulder It 's his pet hawk , of all things , the hawk is black as night and sits there on his shoulder pecking nastily at a clunk of hamburg heholds up to it In fact the sight of that is so rarelypoetic , McLear whose poetry is really like a black hawk , he 's always writing about darkness , dark brown , dark bedrooms , moving curtains , chemical fire dark pillows , love in chemical fiery red darkness , and writes all that in beautiful long lines that go across the page irregularlyand aptly somehow Handsome Hawk McLear , in factI suddenly yell out " Now I know your real name ! it 's M'Lear ! M ' Lear the Scotch Highland moorhaunter with his hawk about to go mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly thing , feeling good againnow we 've got new wine  --  Time to go back to the cabinp133and fly down that dark highway the way only Cody can fly ( even bettern Dave Wain but you feel safer with Dave Wain tho the reason Cody gives you a sense of dooming boom as he pushes the night out the wheels is not because he 'll lose perfect control of the car but you feel the car will take off suddenly up to Heaven or at least just up into what the Russians call the Dark Cosmos , there 's a booming rushing sound out the window when Cody bats her down the white line at night , with Dave Wain it 's all conversation and smooth sailing , with Cody it 's a crisis about to get worse ) And now he 's saying to me " Not only today but the other day with the boys , that beautiful McLear woman there , wow , with her tight blue jeans , man I cried under a tree to see that poppin around so innocent like , whoo , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : tomorrow we go back to Los Gatos the whole family and we 've dropped Evelyn and the kids home after the hiss-the-villain play we 're all gon na seeat seven " The what ? " " It 's a play , " he sayssuddenly imitating the tired whiney voice of an old P.T.A . Committee woman , " you go there and you sit down and out comes this old 1910 play about villains foreclosing the mortgage , mustaches , you know , calico tears , you can sit there you see and hiss the villain all you want evenfor all I know yell obscenities or something I du n no But it 's Evelyn 's world , you know , she 's designing the sets and that 's the work she 's done while I was in the can so I cant begrudge her that , in fact I ai nt got a word in edgewise , when you 're the father of a family you go along with the little woman acourse , and the kids enjoy it , after that plan and after you 've hissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " zooming up the car even of all thinks , the hawk is black as night and sits therep134faster in lieu of rubbing his hands with zeal , so to say Zoom , " you and me gon na go flyin down that Bay Shore highway and as usual you 're gon na ask your usual dumb almost Okie wino questions , Hey Cody " ( whining like a old drunk ) " I b'lieve we 're comin into Burlingame ai nt it ? and you 're always wrong , hee hee , old crazy dumb fuckin old Jack , then we go rubbin shoulders into that City and go poppin right up to my sweet little old baby Willamine that I want you to meet inasmuch and also I want you go dig because she 's gon na dig YOU my dear old sonumbitch Jack , and I 'm gon na leave you two little lovebirds together for days on end alone , you 71 live there and just enjoy that gone little woman beca:ase also " ( his tone now businesslike ) " I want her to dig as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what YOU know , hear me ? she 's my soulmate and confidante and mistress and I want her to be happy and learn " " What 's she look like ? " I ask grossly And I see the grimace on his face , he really knows me , " Eh well she looks alright , she has a gone little body that 's all I can say and in bed she is by far the first and only and lastpossible greatest everything you dig " This being just another of a long line of occasions when Cody gets me to be a sub-beau for his beauties so that everything can tie in together , he really loves me like a brother and more than that , he gets annoyed at me sometimes especially when I fumble and blumble like with a bottle or the time I almost stripped the gears of the car because I forgot I was driving , in which case actually I remind him of his old wino father but the fantastic thing is that HE reminds ME of MY father so that we have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears , it 's easy for me to think of Cody and almost cry , sometimes I can see the same tearful expression in his eyes when he sometimes looks at me He reminds me of my father because he too blusters and hurries and fills all his pockets with Racing Forms and papers and pencils and we 're all ready to go on some mission in the night he takes with ultimate seriousness as tho we were going on the last trip of them all but it always ends up being a hilarious meaningless Marx Brothers adventure which gives me even more reason to love him ( and my father too ) That way And finally in thebook I wrote about us ( " On The Road " ) I forgot to mention two important things , that we were both devout little Catholics in our childhood , which gives us something in common tho we never talk about it , it 's just there in our natures , and secondly and most important that strange business when we shared another girl ( Marylou , or that is , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what we 'll be old buddy , you and me , double husbands , later on we 'll have whole Harreeeem and reams of Hareems boy , and we 'll call ourselves or that is " ( flutter ) " ourself Duluomeray , see Duluoz and Pomeray , Duluomeray , see , hee hee hee " tho he was younger then and really silly but that gives an indicationof the way he felt about me : some kind of new thing in the world actually where men can really be angelic friends and not be homosexual and not fight over girls But alas the only thing we 'd ever fought about wasmoney , or the ridiculous time we fought about a little line of marijuana dust running down the middle of a page where we were separating our shares with a knife , when I objected I wanted some of the dust he yelled " Ourp136original agreement had nothing to do with the dust ! " and he slumps it all into his pocket and stalks off redfaced so I jump up and pack and announce I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car wont start ( this is years ago ) so Cody redfaced and crazy and ashamed now has to push us with the clunker , there we go down San Jose boulevard with Cody behind us pushing us and with Cody behind us pushing us and bumping us not just to give us a start but to chastise me for being so greedy and I shouldnt leave at all In fact he 'd backup and come up on our rear and really wham usThat night ending me dead drunk on Mal Damlette 's floor on North Beach And in any case the whole r'tiestionof us , the two most advanced men friends in , the world still fighting over money after all being , as Julien says in New York , indication of the fact that " Money is the only thing Canucks ever fight about , and Okies too I guess " but Julien I suppose imagining and fantasizing himself as a noble Scotsman who fights about honor ( tho I tell him " Ah you Scotchmen save your spit in your watchpocket " ) . Lacrimae rerum , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody , the way I always say " me and Cody " instead of " Cody and I " or some such , and Irwin watching us across the world night now with a bite of marvel on his lower lip saying " Ah , angels of the West , Companions in Heaven " and writing letters asking " What now , what 's the latest , what visions , what arguments , what sweet agreements ? " and such . That night the kids end up sleeping in the jeep anyway because they 're afraid of the big black woods and I sleep by the creek in my bag and in the morning we 're all set to go back to Los Gatos and see the villain play p 137Frustrated Ron is casting sad eyes at Evelyn , apparently she 's put him off because she says to me ( and I do nt blame her ) " Really the way Cody presses people on me it 's awful , at least I should have my own choice " ( but she 's laughing because it 's funny and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that 's whatshe really wants and wants no such thing ) " At leastnot with utter strangers , " says I to be funny She : - " Besides I 'm so sick of all this sex business , that 's all he talks about , his friends , here they are all open channelsto do good as co creators with God and all they thinkabout is behinds that 's why you 're so refreshing " sheadds " But I ai nt so refreshing as all that ? hey ! " But that 's my relationship with Evelyn , we 're real pals and we can kid about anything even the first night I met her in Denver in 1947 when we danced and Cody watched anxiously , a kind of romantic pair in fact and I shudder sometimes to think of all that stellar mystery of how sheIS going to get me in a future lifetime , wow And Iseriously do believe that will be my salvation , too . A long way to go . P138THE SILLY STUPID HISS-THE-VILLAIN PLAY IS alRIGHT INITSELF but just as we arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done up real old western style there 's a big fat sheriff type with two sixshooters standing at the admission gate , Cody says " That 's to give it color see " but I 'm drunk and as we all pile out of the car I go up to the fat sheriff and start telling him a Southern joke ( in fact just the plot of an Erskine Caldwell short story ) which he receives with a witless smiling expressionor really like the expression of an executioner or a Southern constable listening to a Yankee talk So naturally I 'm surprised later when we go into the cute old west saloon and the kids start banging on the old piano and I join them with big loud Stravinsky chords , here comes two gun sheriff fatty coming in and saying in a menacing voice like T.V. western movies " You cant playthat piano " I 'm surprised , turning to Evelyn , to learnthat he 's the blasted proprietor of the whole place andp139if he says I cant play the piano there 's nothing I can do about it legally But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's going all out to play the part But to be yanked from joyful pianothumping withkids to see that awful dead face of negative horror I just jump up and say " Alright , the hell with it I 'm leaving anyway " so Cody follows me to the car where I takeanother swig of white port " Let 's get the hell out ofhere " I say " Just what I was thinkin about , " says Cody , " in fact I 've already arranged with the director of the play to drive Evelyn and the kids home so we 'll just goto the City now " " Great ! " " And I 've told Evelynwe 're cuttin out so let 's go . " " I 'm sorry Cody I screwed up your little family party " " No No " he protests " Man I have to come to these things you know and be a big hubby and father type and you know I 'm on parole and I got ta put up appearancesbut it 's a drag " To show what a drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars easy as pie " And I 'm GLAD this happened because it gave usan excuse , hee hee titter you know to get outa there , I was thinking for an excuse when it happened , that old fart is crazy you know ! he 's a millionaire you know ! I 've talked to him , that little beady brain , and you be glad you missed hangin around till that performance , man , and that AUDIENCE , ow , ugh , I almost wish I was back in San Quentin but here we go , son ! " So of old we 're alone in a car at night bashing down the line to a specific somewhere , nothing nowhere about it whatever , especially this time , in a way That whiteline is feeding into our fender like an anxious impatient electronic quiver shuddering in the night and how beau/tifully sometimes it curves one side or the other as he smoothly swerves for passing or for something else , avoidinga bump or something And on the big highwayBay Shore how beautifully he just swings in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and to the left without a flaw all kinds of cars with anxious eyes turning to us , altho he 's the only one on the road who knows how to drive completelywell It 's blue dusk all up and down the Californiaworld Frisco glitters up ahead Our radioplays rhythm and blues as we pass the joint back and forth in jutjawed silence both looking ahead with big private thoughts now so vast we cant communicate them any more and if we tried it would take a milli ! bn yearsand a billion books Too late , too late , the history ofeverything we 've seen together and separately has becomea library in itself -- The shelves pile higher They'refull of misty documents or documents of the Mist The mind has convoluted in every tuckaway everywhichawaytuckered hole till there 's no more the expressing ofour latest thoughts let alone old Mighty genius of themind Cody whom I announce as the greatest writer the world will ever know if he ever gets down to writingagain like he did earlier It 's so enormous we both sithere sighing in fact " No the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few letters to Willamine , in fact quite a few , she 's got em all wrapped in ribbons there , I figgered if I tried to write a book or sumptin or prose or sumptin they 'd just take it away from me when I left so I wrote her'bout three letters a week for two years and the troubleof course and as I say and you 've heard a million times is the mind flows the mind rises and nobody canp141by any possible c  --  oh hell , I do nt wanta talk about it " Besides I can see from glancing at him that becoming a writer holds no interest for him because life is so holy for him there 's no need to do anything but live it , writing'sjust an afterthought or a scratch anyway at the surface But if he could ! if he would ! there I am ridingin California miles away from home where my poor cat 's buried and my mother grieves and that 's what I 'm thinking . It always makes me proud to love the world somehow Hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headbent to the silliest hate I ever had . - p142ALTHO CODY 'S SAID THESE THINGS I 'm very well aware thatthe real arrangement of the evening is that we 're just going to see Billie together so she can get her kicks meetingme ( after hearing about me from him and after readingmy books etc. ) and in fact Cody has already conferred with Evelyn about how I 'm going to be staying at their house in Las Gatos for a month , as of old sleeping in my bag in the backyard not because they do nt want me to sleep in the house but it 's my idea , but it 's beautiful anyway to sleep under the stars and anyway I therefore keep out of the way of the family when they get up to go to work and school At noon they see me shamblingin from the big back field yard yawning for coffeeAnd I 'm in line for that , i.e. , that 's what I want to do and that 's my plan But when we run upstairs to Willamine'sapartment and come bursting in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , strange doodads , neat kitchen , the whole clean as a pin , andp143there 's Billie herself a blonde with arched eyebrows exactly like the male Julien blond with arched eyebrows and I yell out " It 's JUlien by God it 's Julien ! " ( and by now I 'm drunk anyway because we 've as of old picked up an old hitch hiker on Bay Shore who says his name is Joe Ihnat and we bought him a bottle and I bought me one too , never will forget old Joe Ihnat in fact somehow because he said he was a Russian and his was an ancient Russian name and when I wrote out our names he said my name w , as an ancient Russian name also ) ( tho it 's Breton ) ( raid also told us he 'd just been beaten up by a young Negro for no reason in a public toilet and Cody gasps and says to me " I 've met those Negroes that beat up old men , they 're called the Strongarms in San Quentin , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners , they 're all Negroes and it seems all they wanta do is beat up old defenseless men , he 's tellin the absolute truth " " But why do they do that ? " " Ohman I do nt know they just wanta hit up on some old man that cant hit back and just beat him and beat him till he 's dead " and Oh the horror of Cody 's knowledge of the world when all is said and done ) So now we'resitting with Billie in her pad , outside the window you see the glittering lights of the city again , ah Urbi y Roma , the world again , and she 's got these mad blue eyes , arched eyebrows , intelligent face , just like Julien , I keep saying " Julien goddamit ! " and I see even in my drunkenness alittle worried flutter in Cody 's eyes The fact of the matter being , Billie and I go for each other like two tons of bricks right there in front of Cody so that when he rises and announces he 's going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work it 's already well agreed I'mp144staying right where I am and not only for tonight but for weeks months years . Poor Cody Yet you see I 've already explained whyactually subconsciously this is what he really wants to happen but he wont admit it ever and always invents reasons around this to get mad at me and call me a bastard Butaside from Cody I find Billie to be a verycompanionable strange kid in this lonesome night and Iactually NEED to stay with her awhile In fact bothBillie and I explain to Cody why But there 's nothingevil , man-against-man or sinister about any of it , it 's just a strange innocence , a spontaneous burst of love in fact and Cody understands that bettern anybody else anyway so he leaves at midnight saying he 'll be back tomorrow night and all of a sudden I 'm alone with a charming woman and we 're talking a blue streak sitting crosslegged facing each other on the floor in a litter of books and bottles . It gives me a pang of pain and remorse really now to recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean and charming The chair by the goldfishbowl which I quickly appropriated as my old man chair , where I sat constantly sipping port for a whole week , the kitchen with its intelligent arrangements of spices and eggs in the icebox , and for that matter too the poor little son of Billie sleeping in a well arranged back room ( her son from her deceased husband who was also a railroadman ) Elliott the child 's name and I did nt get to seehim till later that night And with the huge packet ofCody 's San Quentin letters in her hand she launches forth on her theories about Cody and eternity but all I can keep saying as I swig from my bottle is " Julien , you'rep145talking too much ! Julien , Julien , my God who 'd ever dream I 'd run into a woman who looks like Julien ... you look like Julien but you 're not Julien and on top of that you 're a woman , how goddam strange " In fact she had topack me off to bed drunk But not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being absolutely true But the main thingbeing that tho she looked like Julien etc. and had Cody 's big sad abstract letters about Karma in a/ribbon and actually went out in the morning and earyded a hundred a week in fashion modeling she had the most musicalbeautiful and sad voice I 've ever heard in my life The things she 's saying are really rather inane because after all her education is based on really Californian hysterias like the earlier mistress of Cody Rosemarie who also was thin and pale haired and crazy and kept talkingabstract ( Like she 's saying " I thought I could dosomething to ease the contradiction between immanent and universal ethics which I thought was my problem and was what I hoped to gain thru therapy , like , any evolution presupposes an involution and all that kind of thinking " as I sigh , but she does say something interestingonce in a while like " While Cody was in prison my main occupation was praying for him , I had an all day going , there was also a bit we did together every evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else is happening I 'm not sure what . . . but I 'm sure we aid the storm when we transcend time in one respect and canteven keep up with it in others . . . " ) But also all kinds of to-me-unimportant and uninteresting crap about channels about people being either closed or open channelsand Cody is a big open channel pouring out all hisp146holy gysm on Heaven , I really cant remember , or the destinies , the sighs , the rooftops of all that , the stars are shining down on their poor heads as they draw breath to explain inanities really Like the letters to her ( Iglance at them ) are all about how they 've met and their souls have collided in this dimension because of some unfulfilled Karma on another planet and in another plane that is , and now they have to gird themselves to assume this big responsibility to meet some measure of this andthat , I do nt even wanta go into it Because also the fact of the matter being , when Willamine talks to me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad music of her voice and in the strange circumstance ( I guess Karmaliketoo ) that she looks like poor Julien . Her voice is the main point She talks with a brokenheart Her voice lutes brokenly like a heart lost , musicallytoo , like in a lost grove , it 's almost too much to bear sometimes like some fantastic futuristic Jerry Southern singer in a night club who steps up to the mike in the spotlight in Las Vegas but does nt even have to sing , just talk , to make men sigh and women wonder I guess ( ifwomen ever wonder ) So that as she 's trying to explainall that nonsense to me ( all that philosophy of hers and Cody 's and Cody 's new buddy Perry , coming up the next day ) I just sit and marvel and stare at her mouth wondering where all the beauty is coming from and why And we end up making love sweetly too  --  A little blonde well experienced in all the facets of lovemaking and sweet with compassion and just too much so that b'dawn we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a week In fact I can see it now , a greatbig four way marriage with Cody and Evelyn.  |p147For  she is the great enemy of Evelyn She 's not satisfiedjust to be Cody 's lover and soul heart she wants to go right over there and lay Evelyn down on the line and take Cody away with her forever and to do this she 'll even have a deadend heaven deep love affair with oldJack ( same pattern of old ) There 's not much differencebetween her and Evelyn when you listen to their talk about Cody except in Evelyn 's case I 'm alwaysfascinatedly interested Billie actually bores me tho ofcourse I cant tell her that Evelyn is still the champand I wonder about Cody. 0 the ups and downs and juggling of women , blondes at that , all in the great magical City of the Gandharvas of San Francisco and here I am alone on a magic carpet with one of em , whee , at first of course it 's a great ball , a great new eye-shattering explosion of experienceNot dreaming , I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms and my name Billie too now , Billie and Billie arm in arm , oh beautiful , and Cody has given his consent in a way , we go roaming the Genghiz Khan clouds of soft love and hope and anybody who 's neverdone this is crazy Because a new love affair always gives hope , the irrational mortal loneliness is always crowned , that thing I saw ( that horror of snake emptiness ) when I took the deep iodine deathbreath on the Big Sur beach is now justified and hosannah 'd and raised up like a sacred urn to Heaven in the mere fact of the taking off of clothes and clashing wits and bodies in theinexpressibly nervously sad delight of love Do nt letno old fogies tell you otherwise , and on top of that nobody in the world even ever dares to write the true story of love , it 's awful , we 're stuck with a 50% incompletep148literature and drama Lying mouth to mouth , kiss tokiss in the pillow dark , loin to loin in unbelievable surrenderingsweetness so distant from all our mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antisexual somehow The secret underground truth of mad desire hiding under fenders under buried junkyards throughout the world , never mentioned in newspapers , written about haltingly and like corn by authors and painted tongue in cheek by artists , agh , just listen to Tristan and Isolde by Wagner and think of him in a Bavarian field with his beloved naked beauty under the fall leaves . How strange in all , and making everything that 's happened in the past weeks , the backs and forths and pains of me in City and Sur , all piled up now rationally like a big construction whereon could be built a divingboard which would enable me clumsily to dive into Billie 's soul and therefore why complain ? In the middle of the night she fetches the little 4 year old boy to show me the spiritual beauty of her son He is one of the weirdest persons I 've ever met Hehas large liquid brown eyes very beautiful and he hates anybody who comes near his mother and keeps asking her questions constantly like " Why do you stay with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " Why is it dark outside ? " or " Why does the sun shine yesterday ? " or anything , he 'll just ask questions about everything and she answers every one of them with extreme delight and patience till I say " Does nt he bother you with all these questions ? why do nt you let him croon and goof like a little child , he 's tugging at your knee asking EVERYTHING man why do nt youjust let him singsong ? " She answers " I answer himBIG SUR 149because I may be missing his next question , everything he asks me and says to me represents something importantabout the absolute I may be missing " " What doyou mean the absolute ? " " You yourself said everything is the absolute " but of course she 's right and I realize that in my dirty old soul I 'm already jealous of Elliott.  |p150THE  MAT OF NIGHT admits the groaning glory godlike love I guess but at the same time it 's also boring in a way and we both laugh to discuss that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books from Cody in every detail down to me in every detail to her in every detail to Evelyn to books and philosophies and religions and the absolute and I end up whisperingher poems Poor kid has to get up in the morning and go to work and I 'm left there snoring drunk But shemakes her neat breakfast and takes Elliott off to the daily babysitter lady and I wake up at one in the afternoon alone and take a swig of wine and get in the hot bath toread a book The phone keeps ringing , everybody fromMonsanto to Fagan to McLear to the Moon Man has somehow found out where I am and what the number is , tho none of them have previously even met Billie let aloneseen her I shudder to realize Cody will get mad formaking his secret life so public.  |p151But  here comes Perry Like me Perry has thatstrange brotherly relationship with Cody whereby he getsto be confidant and sometimes lover of all Cody 's gals And I can see why He looks just like me only he'syoung and looks like I did when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , he is a tempestuous lost tossed soul just out of Soledad State Prison for attempted robbery with a boyish face and black hair falling over it but powerful thick muscular arms that I realize liecould break a man in half with His name is strangetoo , Perry Yturbide , I immediately say : " I know whatyou are , Basque " " Basque ? is that it ? I never foundout ! let 's call my mother longdistance in Utah and tellher that ! " And he rings up his mother way over there , on Billie 's phone bill , and here I am bottle of port wine in one hand and butt in mouth talking to a Basque ex con 's mother in Utah telling her in fact reassuring her " Yes I believe it 's a Basque name " She 's saying " Hey , what you say ? who are you ? " and there 's Perry smilingall glad A very strange kid It 's been a long timein fact in my literary sort of life that I 've met a real tough hombre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel and that fevered concern that scares governments and makes officials pale , that 's why he 's always put away inprison this type of man Yes yet the type of man thecountry always needs when there 's a little old war startedby an aging governor A real dangerous character , infact , Perry , because tho I appreciate his poetic soul and everything I realize looking at him he 's capable of explodingand killing somebody for an idea maybe or for love . Some of his own friends ring Billie 's doorbell , every/body seems to know I 'm there , they come up , they are strange anarchistic Negroes and ex cons , it seems to be some sort of gang , I begin to wonder Like a ring offevered sages , the Negroes are intense and crazy and intellectual but they 've all got those strong muscular arms again and all have jail records yet they all talk as tho theend of the world depended on their words Hard toexplain ( but will do ) . Billie and her gang in fact , with all that fancy rigamaroleabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret hustler outfit tho I also realize that I 've noticedit before in San Francisco a kind of ephemeral hysteria that hides in the air over the rooftops among certain circles there leading always to suicide and maim Me just an innocent lost hearted meditator and Goopamong strange intense criminal agitators of the heartIt reminds me in fact of a nightmare I had just before coming out to the Coast , in the dream I 'm back in San Francisco but there 's something funny going on : there 's dead silence throughout the entire city : men like printers and office executives and housepainters are all standing silently in second floor windows looking down on the empty streets of San Francisco : once in a while some beatniks walk by below , also silent : they 're being watched but not only by the authorities but by everybody : the beatniks seem to have the whole street system to themselves : but nobody 's saying anything : and in this intense silence I take a ride on a self propelled platform right downtown and out to the farms where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live with her The little platform rolling quietly as the people arewatching from windows in groups of profile like the pro/files in old Van Dyck paintings , intense , suspicious , momentous ThisBillie business reminding me of that butbecause to me the only thing that matters is the conceptionsin my own mind , there has to be no realityanyway to what I suppose is going on But this alsoan indication of the coming madness in Big Sur.  |p154STRANGE  and Perry Yturbide that first day whileBillie 's at work and we 've just called his mother now wants me to come with him to visit a general of the U.S.Army " Why ? and what 's all these generals lookingout of silent windows ? " I say But nothing surprisesPerry " We 'll go there because I want you to dig themost beautiful girls we ever saw , " in fact we take a cab But the " beautiful girls " turn out to be 8 and 9 and10 years old , daughters of the general or maybe even cousins or daughters of a nextdoor strange general , but the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backroom , we have Elliott with us whom Perry has carried on his shoulders all the way I look at Perry andhe says " I wanted you to see the most beautiful little cansin town " and I realize he 's dangerously insane In fact he then says " See this perfect beauty ? " a pony tailed 10 year old daughter of the general ( who ai nt home yet ) " I 'm going to kidnap her right now " and he takes her byp155the hand and they go out on the street for an hour whileI sit there over drinks talking to the mother There'ssome vast conspiracy to make me go mad anyway The mother is polite as ordinarily The general comeshome and he 's a rugged big baldheaded general and with him is his best friend a photographer called Shea , a thin well combed welldressed ordinary downtown commercialphotographer of the city I do nt understand anything But suddenly little Elliott is crying in the other roomand I rush in there and see that the two boys have whacked him or something because he did something wrong so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my shoulders like Perry does , only Elliott wants to get down off my shoulders at once , in fact hewont even sit on my lap , in fact he hates my guts I call Billie desperately at her agency and she says she 'll be over to pick us all up and adds " How 's Perry today ? " " He 's kidnapping little girls he says are beautiful , he wants to marry 10 year old girls with pony tails " " That 's the way he is , be sure to dig him " In hermusical sad voice over the phone . I turn my poor tortured attention to the general who says he was an anti-Fascist fighter with the Maquis during World War II and also a guerilla in the South Pacific and knows one of the finest restaurants in San Francisco where we can all go feast , a Fillipino restaurant near Chinatown , I say okay , great He gives me more booze Seeingthe amusing Irish face of Shea the photographer I yell " You can take my picture anytime you want " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything but propagandareasons " " What the hell do you mean propagandareasons , I ai nt got nothin to do with propaganda "  | ( and here comes Perry back through the door with Poopooholding his hand , they 've gone to dig the street and have a coke ) and I realize everybody is just living their lives quietly but it 's only me that 's insane . In fact I yearn to have old Cody around to explain all this to me tho it soon becomes apparent to me not even Cody could explain , I 'm beginning to go seriously crazy , just like Subterranean Irene went crazy tho I do nt realize it yet I 'm beginning to read plots into every simpleline  --  Besides the " general " scares me even further by turning out to be a strange affluent welldressed civilian who does nt even help me to pay the tab for the Fillipino dinner which we have , meeting Billie at the restaurant , and the restaurant itself is weird especially because of a big raunchy mad thicklipped sloppy young Fillipino woman sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food obscenely and looking at us insolently as tho to say " Fuck you , I eat the way I like " splashing gravyeverywhere  --  I cant understand what 's going on Becausealso the general has suggested this dinner but I have to pay for everybody , him , Shea , Perry , Billie , Elliott , me , others , strange apocalyptic madness is now shuddering in my eyeballs and I 'm even running out of money in their Apocalypse which they themselves have created in this San Francisco silence anyway . I yearn to go hide and cry in Evelyn 's arms but I end up hiding in Billie 's arms and here she goes again , the second evening , explaining all her spiritual ideas " But what about Perry ? what 's he up to ? and who 's that strange general ? what are you , a bunch of communists ? "  |p157THE  LITTLE CHILD REFUSES TO SLEEP in his crib but has tocome trotting out and watch us make love on the bed but Billie says " That 's good , he 'll learn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ashamed but because Billie is there and she 's the mother I must go along and not worry Another sinister fact At one point the poor childis drooling long slavers of spit from his lips watching , I cry " Billie , look at him , it 's not good for him " but she says again " Anything he wants he can have , even us . " " But kid it 's not fair , why does n't he just sleep ? " " He does nt wanta sleep , he wants to be with us " " Ooh , " and I realize Billie is insane and I 'm not as insane as I thought and there 's something wrong I feel myselfskidding : also because during the following week I keep sitting in that same chair by the goldfish bowl drinkingbottle after bottle of port like an automaton , worrying about something , Monsanto comes to visit , McLear , Fagan , everybody , they call to me dashing up the stairsp158and we have long drunken days talking but I never seem to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading books And at nightBillie comes home and we pitch into love again like monsters who do nt know what else to do and by now I 'm too blurry to know what 's going on anyway tho she reassures me everything is alright , and meanwhile Cody has completely disappeared  --  In fact I call him up and say " Are you gon na come back and get me here ? " " Yes yes yes in a few days , stay there " as tho maybe he wants me to learn what 's happening like putting me through an ordeal to see what I have to say about it because he 's been through the ordeal himself . In fact everything is going crazy . Perry 's visits scare me : I begin to think he must be one of those " strong armers " who beat up old men : I watch him warily All this time he 's pacing back and forthsaying " Man do nt you appreciate those sweet little cans ? what does it matter how old a woman is , 9 or 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littlejigglin cans " " Did you ever kidnap one ? " " You out of wine , I 'll make a run for you get some more , or would you rather have pot or sumptin ? what 's wrong with you ? " " I do nt know what 's goin on ! " " You 're drinkingtoo much maybe , Cody told me you 're falling apart man , do nt do it " " But what 's goin on ? " " Who cares , pops , we 're all swingin in love and tryin to go from day to day with self respect while all the squares are puttin usdown " " Who ? " - " The Squares , puttin down Us . . . we wanta swing and live and carry across the night like when we get to L.A. I 'm goin to show you the maddest scene some friends of mine down there " ( in my drunken/ness I 've already projected a big trip with Billie and Elliott and Perry to Mexico but we 're going to stop in L.A. to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him money and if she does nt he 's going to get it anyway , and as I say Billie and I are going to get married too ) The insanest week of my life Billie at nightsaying " You 're worried that I cant handle marrying you but of course we can , Cody wants it too , I 'll talk to your mother and make her love me and need me : Jack ! " she suddenly cries with anguished musical voice ( because I 've just said " Ah Billie go get yourself a he-man and get married " ) , " You 're my last chance to marry a He Man ! " " Whattayou mean He Man , do nt you realize I'mcrazy ? " " You 're crazy but you 're my last chance tohave an understanding with a He Man " " What aboutCody ? " " Cody will never leave Evelyn " Verystrange But more , tho I do nt understand it.  |p160I  DO UNDERSTAND THE STRANGE DAY BEN FAGAN FINALLYCAME to visit me alone , bringing wine , smoking his pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair you say you 've been sitting in for days have you noticed the bottom is falling out of it ? " I get on the floor and by God look and it 's true , the springs are coming out " How long have you been sitting in that chair ? " " Every day waiting for Billie to come home and talking to Perry and the others all day . . . My God let 's go out and sit in the park , " I add In the blur of days McLearhas also been over on a forgotten day when , on nothing but his chance mention that maybe I could get his book published in Paris I jump up and dial longdistance for Paris and call Claude Gallimard and only get his butler apparently in some Parisian suburb and I hear the insanegiggle on the other end of the line " Is this the home , c'est le chez eux de Monsieur Gallimard ? " Giggle " On est Monsieur Gallimard ? " Giggle A verystrange phone call McLear waiting there expectantlyp161to get his " Dark Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London to talk to my old buddy Lionel just for no reason at all and I finally reach him at home he 's saying on the wire " You 're calling me fromSan Francisco ? buy why ? " Which I cant answer anymore than the giggling butler ( and to add to my madness , of course , why should a longdistance call to Paris to a publisher end up with a giggle and a longdistance call to an old friend in London end up with the friendgetting mad ? ) So Fagan now sees I 'm going overboardcrazy and I need sleep " We 'll get a bottle ! " Iyell But end up , he 's sitting in the grass of the parksmoking his pipe , from noon to 6 P.M. , and I 'm passed out exhausted sleeping in the grass , bottle unopened , only to wake up once in a while wondering where I am and by God I 'm in Heaven with Ben Fagan watching over men and me . And I say to Ben when I wake up in the gathering 6 P.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day by sleepinglike this " but he says : " You needed the sleep , I told ya " " And you mean to tell me you been sitting allafternoon like that ? " " Watching unexpected events , " says he , " like there seems to be sound of a Bacchanal in those bushes over there " and I look and hear childrenyelling and screaming in hidden bushes in the park " What they doing ? " " I do nt know : also a lot ofstrange people went by " " How long have I beensleeping ? " " Ages " " I 'm sorry " " Why shouldbe sorry , I love you anyway " " Was I snoring ? " " You 've been snoring all day and I 've been sitting hereall day " " What a beautiful day ! " " Yes it 's been abeautiful day " " How strange ! " " Yes , strange .. .  |p162but  not so strange either , you 're just tired " " What doyou think of Billie ? " He chuckles over his pipe : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog bit your leg ? " " Why do you have a diamond in your forehead ? " " I do nt have a diamond in my forehead damn you and stop making arbitrary conceptions ! " he roars " Butwhat am I doing ? " " Stop thinking about yourself , willya , just float with the world " " Did the world floatby the park ? " " All day , you should have seen it , I'vesmoked a whole package of Edgewood , it 's been a verystrange day " " Are you sad I did nt talk to you ? " " Not at all , in fact I 'm glad : we better be starting back , " he adds , " Billie be coming home from work soon now " " Ah Ben , Ah Sunflower " " Ah shit " he says " It 's strange " " Who said it wasnt " " I do nt understand it " " Do nt worry about it " " Hmm holy room , sad room , life is a sad room " " All sentient beingsrealize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than all our Georges and Arthurs actually " BenI think I 'm going crazy " " You saidthat to me in 1955 " " Yeh but my brain 's gettin softfrom drinkin and drinkin and drinkin " " What youneed is a cup of tea I 'd say if I did nt know that you'retoo crazy to know how really crazy you are " " Butwhy ? what 's going on ? " " Did you come three thousandmiles to find out ? " " Three thousand miles fromwhere , after all ? from whiney old me " " That 's alright , everything is possible , even Nietzsche knew that " " Ai nt nothin wrong with old Nietzsche " " ' Xcept hewent mad too " " Do you think I 'm going mad ? " " Ho ho ho " ( hearty laugh ) " What 's that mean , laughingat me ? " " Nobody 's laughing at you , do nt get ex/cited " " What 'll we do now ? " " Let 's go visit themuseum over there " There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I get up wobbly and walk with old Ben across the sad grass , at one point I put myarm over his shoulder and lean on him " Are you aghoul ? " I ask " Sure , why not ? " " I like ghouls thatlet me sleep ? " " Duluoz it 's good for you to drink in away ' cause you 're awful stingy with yourself when You'resober " " You sound like Julien " " I never met Julienbut I understand Billie looks like him , you kept saying that before you went to sleep " " What happened whileI was asleep ? " " Oh , people went by and came backand forth and the sun sank and finally sank down and 's gone now almost as you can see , what you want , justname it you got it " " Well I want sweet salvation " " What 's sposed to be sweet about salvation ? maybe it 's sour " " It 's sour in my mouth " " Maybe your mouth is too big , or too small , salvation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any little kittiestoday ? " " Shore , hundreds of em came to visit youwhile you were sleeping " " Really ? " " Sure , didntyou know you were saved ? " " Now come on ! " " One of them was real big and roared like a lion but he had a big wet snout and kissed you and you said Ah " " What 's this museum up here ? " " Let 's go in andfind out " That 's the way Ben is , he does nt know what'sgoing on either but at least he waits to find out maybe But the museum is closed We stand there on thesteps looking at the closed door " Hey , " I say , " thetemple is closed . " So suddenly in red sundown me and Ben Fagan arm in arm are walking slowly sadly back down the broadp164steps like two monks going down the esplanade of Kyoto ( as I imagine Kyoto somehow ) and we 're both smiling happily suddenly I feel good because I 've had mysleep but mainly I feel good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by sitting over my sleep allday and now with these few silly words Arm in armwe slowly descend the steps without a word It 's been the only peaceful day I 've had in California , in fact , except alone in the woods , which I tell him and says " Well , who said you werent alone now ? " making me realizethe ghostliness of existence tho I feel his big bulging body with my hands and say : " You sure some patheticghost with all that ephemeral heavy crock a flesh " " Ididnt say nottin " he laughs " Whatever I say Ben , dontmind it , I 'm just a fool " " You said in 1957 in thegrass drunk on whiskey you were the greatest thinker inthe world " " That was before I fell asleep and wokeup : now I realize I 'm no good at all and that makes mefeel free " " You 're not even free being no good , youbetter stop thinking , that 's all " - " I 'm glad you visitedme today , I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are we gon na do with our lives ? " " Oh , " he says , " I du n no , just watch em I guess " " Doyou hate me ? . . . well , do you like me ? . . . well , howare things ? " " The hicks are alright " " Anybody hexya lately . . . ? " " Yeh , with cardboard games ? " " Cardboard games ? " I ask " Well you know , they buildcardboard houses and put people in them and the people are cardboard and the magician makes the dead body twitch and they bring water to the moon , and the moon has a strange ear , and all that , so I 'm alright , Goof . " " Okay . "  |p165SO  THERE I AM AS IT STARTS TO GET DARK standing withone hand on the window curtain looking down on the street as Ben Fagan walks away to get the bus on the corner , his big baggy corduroy pants and simple blue Goodwill workshirt , going home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really worried or at least not worriedabout what I 'm worried about tho he too carries that anguishing guilt I guess and hopeless remorse that the potboiler of time has nt made his early primordial dawns over the pines of Oregon come true I 'm clutching at the drapes of the window like the Phantom of the Opera behind the masque , waiting for Billie to come home and remembering how I used to stand by the windows like this in my childhood and look out on dusky streets and think how awful I was in this development everybody said was supposed to be " my life " and " their lives . " Not so much that I 'm a drunkard that I feel guilty about but that others who occupy this plane of " life on earth "  |p166with  me do nt feel guilty at all Crooked judges shavingand smiling in the morning on the way to their heinous indifferences , respectable generals ordering soldiers by telephone to go die or drop dead , pickpockets nodding in cells saying " I never hurt anybody , " " that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " women who regard themselvessaviors of men simply stealing their substance because they think their swan-rich necks deserve it anyway ( though for every swan-rich neck you lose there 's another ten waiting , each one ready to lay for a lemon ) , in fact awful hugefaced monsters of men just because their shirts are clean deigning to control the lives of working men by running for Governor saying " Your tax money in my hands will be aptly used , " " You should realize how valuable I am and how much you need me , without me what would you be , not led at all ? " Forward to the big designed mankind cartoon of a man standing facing the rising sun with strong shoulders with a plough at his feet , the necktied governor is going to make haywhile the sun rises ? I feel guilty for being a member of the human race Drunkard yes and one of theworst fools on earth In fact not even a genuine drunkardjust a fool But I stand there with hand on curtainlooking down for Billie , who 's late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said which is other than those reassuring words of his I remembered in the cabin of sweet loneness on Big Sur : " When the various experiencescome to light in meditation , do not be proud and anxious to tell other people , else to Goddesses and Mothers you will bring annoyance " and here I am a perfectly obvious fool American writer doing just that not only for a living ( which I was always able to glean anyway fromp167railroad and ship and lifting boards and sacks with humble hand ) but because if I do nt write what actually I see happening in this unhappy globe which is rounded by the contours of my deathskull I think I 'll have been sent onearth by poor God for nothing Tho being a Phantomof the Opera why should that worry me ? In my youthleaning my brow hopelessly on the typewriter bar , wondering why God ever was anyway ? Or biting my lipin brown glooms in the parlor chair in which my father'sdied and we 've all died a million deaths Only Fagancan understand and now he 's got his bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the chair and it utterly collapses under me , blang , I 'm sprawled on the floor with surprise , the chair has gone . " How 'd that happen ? " wonders Billie and at the same time we both look at the fishbowl and both the goldfishes are upsidedown floating dead on the surface of the water . I 've been sitting in that chair by that fishbowl for a week drinking and smoking and talking and now the goldfishare dead . " What killed them ? " " I do nt know " " Did I killthe because I gave them some Kelloggs corn flakes ? " " Mebbe , you 're not supposed to give them anything buttheir fish food " " But I thought they were hungry so Igave them a few flicks of corn flakes " " Well I dontknow what killed them " " But why do nt anybodyknow ? what happened ? why do they do this ? otters and mouses and every damn thing dyin on all sides Billie , I cant stand it , it 's all my goddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fault dear ? " " Dear ? you callme dear ? why do you call me dear ? " " Ah , let me lovep168you " ( kissing me ) , " just because you do nt deserve it " ( Chastised ) : - " Why do nt I deserve it " " Because yousay so . . . " " But what about the fish " " I do nt know , really " " Is it because I 've been sitting in that crumblingchair all week blowing smoke on their water ? andall the others smoking and all the talk ? " But the littlekid Elliott comes crawling up his mommy 's lap and starts asking questions : " Billie , " he calls her , " Billie , Billie , Billie , " feeling her face , I 'm almost going mad from thesadness of it all " What did you do all day ? " " I waswith Ben Fagan and slept in the park . . . Billie what arewe gon na do ? " " Anytime you say like you said , we'llget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm afraid of Perry and I 'm afraid of Elliott " " He'sonly a little boy " " Billie I do nt wanta get married , I 'm afraid . . . " " Afraid ? " " I wanta go home and die with my cat . " I could be a handsome thin young president in a suit sitting in an oldfashioned rocking chair , no insteadI 'm just the Phantom of the Opera standing by adrape among dead fish and broken chairs Can it bethat no one cares who made me or why ? " Jack what'sthe matter , what are you talking about ? " but suddenly as she 's making supper and poor little Elliott is waiting there with spoon upended in fist I realize it 's just a little family home scene and I 'm just a nut in the wrong place  --  And in fact Billie starts saying " Jack we should be married and have quiet suppers like this with Elliott , something would sanctify you forever I 'm positive . " " What have I done wrong ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman like me andfrom previous women and future women like me canyou imagine all the fun we 'd have being married , puttingp169Elliott to bed , going out to hear jazz or even taking planes to Paris suddenly and all the things I have to teach you and you teach me instead all you 've been doing iswasting life really sitting around sad wondering where togo and all the time it 's right there for you to take " - " Supposin I do nt want it " " That 's part of the picturewhere you say you do nt want it , of course you want ... " " But I do nt , I 'm a creepy strange guy you do nt even know " ( " Cweepy ? what 's cweepy ? Billie ? what " scweepy ? " is asking poor little Elliott ) And meanwhilePerry comes in for a minute and I pointblank say to him " I do nt understand you Perry , I love you , dig you , you 're wild , but what 's all this business where you wanta kidnap little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see tears in his eyes and I realize he 's in love with Billie and hasalways been , wow I even say it , " You 're in love withBillie ai nt ya ? I 'm sorry , I 'm cuttin out " " What areyou talkin about man ? " It 's a big argument then about how he and Billie are just friends so I start singing Just Friends like Sinatra " Two friends but not like before " but goodhearted Perry seeing me sing runs downstairs to getanother bottle for me But nevertheless the fish aredead and the chair is broken . Perry in fact is a tragic young man with enormous potentialswho 's just let himself swing and float to hell I guess , unless something else happens to him soon , I look at him and realize that besides loving Billie secretly and truly he must also love old Cody as much as I do and all the world bettern I do yet he is the character who is always being put away behind bars for this Rugged , covered with woe , he sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his black eyes , his iron arms hangingp170helplessly like the arms of a powerful idiot in the madhouse , with the beauty of lostness pasted all over him Who is he ? in fact ? And why does nt blonde Billiewashing the homey dishes there acknowledge his love ? In fact me and Perry end up we 're both sitting withhanging heads when Billie comes back in the livingroom and sees us like that , like two repentant catatonics in hell Some Negro comes in and says if I give him a fewdollars he 'll get some pot but as soon as I give him five dollars he suddenly says " Well I ai nt gon na get nothin " " You got five dollars , go out and get it " " I aintsure I can get any " I do nt like him at all I suddenlyrealize I can leap up and throw him on the floor and take the five dollars away from him but I do nt even care about the money but I am mad about him doingthat " Who is that guy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife and we 'll wreck Billie 's livingroomtoo But suddenly another Negro comes in and turns out a sweet visit talking about jazz and brotherhood and they all leave and me and Jacky are alone to wonder some more . All the muscular gum of sex is such a bore , but Billie and I have such a fantastic sexball anyway that 's why we 're able to philosophize like that and agree and laugh together in sweet nakedness " Oh baby we 're together crazy , we could live in an old log cabin in the hills and never say anything for years , it was meant that we 'd meet " She 's saying all kinds of things as an idea begins to dawn on me : " Say I know Billie , let 's leave the City and take Elliott with us and go to Monsanto 's cabin in the woods for a week or two and forget everything " " YesI can call up my boss right now and get a coupla weeksoff , Oh Jack let 's do it " " And it 'll be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours , my God " " Perry ai nt sinister . " " We 'll get married and go away and have a lodge in the Adirondacks , at night by the lamp we 'll have simple suppers with Elliott " " I 'll make love to you always " " But you wont even have to because we both realize we 're bugs . . . our lodge will have truth written all over it but tho the whole world come smear it with big black paints of hate and lies we 'll be falling dead drunk in truth " " Have some coffee " " My hands 'll grow numb and I wont be able to handle the axe but still I 'll be the truth man ... I 'll stand by the drape of the window night listening to the babble of all the world and I 'll tell you about it " " But Jack I love you and that 's not the only reason why , do nt you see that we 're meant for each other from the beginning , did nt you see that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that silly reason you told me about where I look like some old buddy youknow in New York " " Who hates Cody 's guts and Codyhates him " " But do nt you see what a waste it is ? " " But what about Cody ? you want me to marry you butyou love Cody and in fact Perry loves you too ? " " Sure but what 's wrong with that or all that ? there 's perfect love between us forever there 's no doubt about it but we onlyhave two bodies " ( a strange statement ) I stand bythe window looking out on the glittering San Francisco night with its magic cardboard houses saying " And you have Elliott who does nt like me and I do nt like him and in fact I do nt like you and I do nt like myself either , how about that ? " ( Billie says nothing to this but only storesup an anger that comes out later ) " But we can callDave Wain and he 'll drive us to Big Sur cabin and we'llbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling you that'sp172what I wanta do ! " " Call him now ! " I tell her thenumber and she dials it like a secretary " O the sad music of it all , I 've done it all , seen it all , done everything with everybody " I say phone in hand , " the whole world 's coming on like a high school sophomore eager to learn what he calls New things , mind you , the same old singsongsad song truth of death . . . because the reason I yell death so much is because I 'm really yelling life , because you cant have death without life , hello Dave ? there you are ? know what I 'm callin you about ? listen pal . . . take that big brunette Romana that Rumanian madwoman and pack her in Willie and come down to Billie 's here and pick us up , we 'll pack while you 's en route , honey 's on , and we 'll all go spend two weeks of bliss in Monsanto'scabin " " Does Monsanto agree ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll say sure " " Well I thought I 'd be painting Romana 's wall tomorrow but maybe I 'd a just got drunk doin that anyway : sure you wanta do all thisnow ? " " Yes yeh yeh , come on " " And I can bringRomana ? " " Yes but why not ? " " And what 's the purpose of all this ? " " Ah Daddy , maybe just to seeyou again and we can talk about purposes anywhere : you wanta go on a lecture tour to Utah university and Brownuniversity and tell the well scrubbed kids ? " " Scrubbedwith what ? " " Scrubbed with hopeless perfection ofpioneer puritan hope that leaves nothing but dead pigeonsto look at ? " " Okay I " 11 be right out . . . first I got ta getWillie 's tank filled up and an oil change too " " I 'll payyou when you get here " " I heard you were elopingwith Billie " " Who told you that ?

" " I du n no , remember when we were in East St. Louis with George , and Jack you said you 'd love those beautiful dancing girls if you knew they would live forever as beautiful as they are ?

" " Lissen never mind , I 'll be up , you call Monsantoright away tho because we also got ta get the corralgate keys from him " " I 'm glad I know you Dave " " Me too Jack " " Why ? " " Maybe I wanted to standon my head in the snow to prove it but I do , am glad , will be glad , after all that 's right there 's nothing else for us to do but solve these damn problems and I 've got one righthere in my pants for Romana " " But that 's so sick andtired to call life a problem that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read in the dead pigeon textbooks " " ButDave I love you " " Okay I 'll be rightover.  |p174WE  PACK UP LI1 ' 1'LE ELLIOTT 'S PATHETIC WARMCLOTHES andput food together and get the hamper all set and wait forDave to come sadly in the night And we have a bigtalk " Billie but why did the fish die ? " but she knowsalready they probably died because I gave them Kelloggs cornflakes or something went wrong , one thing sure is that she did nt forget to feed them or anything , it 's all me , all my fault , I 'd as soon be rusted by autumn too-much-think than be dead-fisher cause of those poor little hunks ofgolden death floating on that scummy water It reminds me of the otter But I cant explain it to Billiewho 's all abstract and talking about our abstract soulmeetingsin hell , and little Elliott is pulling at her asking " Where we going ? where we going ? what for ? what for ? " She 's saying " And all because you think you dontdeserve to be loved because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably just died on theirown accord " " Why would they do that ? why ? whatp175kind of logic is that for fish to have ? " " Or because you think you drink too much and therefore every time you 're feeling good on a little booze you give up and say your hands hang helpless , like you said last night when you were holding me with those hands blessing my heart and my body with your love , 0 Jack it 's time for you to wake up and come with me or at least come with somebody and open your eyes to why God 's put you here , stop all that staring at the floor , you and Perry both you 're crazy I 'll draw you magic moon circles 'll change all yourluck " I look her dead in the eye and it is blue and Isay " 0 Billie , forgive me " " But you see you go theretalkin guilty again " " Well I do nt know all those bigtheories about how everything should be goddamit all I know is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye saying Help me " " But when youmake those big final statements it does nt help you " " Of course I know that but what do you want ? " " Iwant us to get married and settle down to a sensibleunderstanding about eternal things " " And you may beright " I see it all raving before me the endless yakkingkitchen mouthings of life , the long dark grave of tomby talks under midnight kitchen bulbs , in fact it fills me with love to realize that life so avid and misunderstood neverthelessreaches out skinny skeleton hand to me and toBillie too But you know what I mean . And this is the way it begins . P176IT SOUNDS ALL SO SAD BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY SUCH A GAYNIGHT as Dave and Romana came over and there 's all the business of packing boxes and clothes down to the car , nipping out of bottles , getting ready in fact to sing all the way to Big Sur " Home On the Range " and " I 'm Just a Lonsome Old Turd " by Dave Wain Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe because I wanted to identify with my old broken front rockingchair and lean there flapping and singing but with Romana between us the seat is pinned down and no longerflaps Meanwhile Billie is on the back mattress withsleeping child and off we go booming down Bay Shore to that other shore whatever it will bring , the way people always feel whenever they essay some trip long or shortespecially in the night The eyes of hope looking overthe glare of the hood into the maw with its white line feedingin straight as an arrow , the lighting of fresh cigarettes , the buckling to lean forward to the next adventure something that 's been going on in America ever since thep177covered wagons clocked the deserts in three months flat Billie does nt mind that I do nt sit in back with herbecause she knows I wanta sing and have a good time Romana and I hit up fantastic medleys of popular and folk songs of all kinds and Dave contributes his New York Chicago blue light nightclub romantic baritone specialties My wavering Sinatra is barely heard in fact Beaton your knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get raucous and moan out Red River Valley , " Where 's my harmonica , I been meanin to buy me a eight dollar harmonica for eight years now . " It always starts out good like that , the bad momentsNothing is gained or lost also by the fact that I insist we stop at Cody 's en route so I can pick up some clothes I left there but secretly I want Evelyn to finally come face to face with Billie It surprises me more howeverto see the look of absolute fright on Cody 's face as we pour into his livingroom at midnight and I announce thatBillie 's in the jeep sleeping Evelyn is not perturbedat all and in fact says to me privately in the kitchen " I guess it was bound to happen sometime she 'd come here and see it but I guess it was destined to be you who 'd bring her " " What 's Cody so worried about ? " " You 're spoiling all his chance to be real secretive " " He has nt come and seen us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , he just left me stranded there : I'vebeen feeling awful , too " " Well if you want you can askher to come in " " Well we 're leaving in a minute anyway , you wanta see her at least ? " " I do nt care " Cody is sitting in the livingroom absolutely rigid , stiff , formal , with a big Irish stone in his eye : I know he 's reallymad at me this time tho I do nt really know why I gop178out and there 's Billie alone in the car over sleeping Elliott biting her fingernail " You wanta come in and meetEvelyn ? " " I shouldnt , she wont like that , is Codythere ? " " Yah " So Willamine climbs out ( I rememberjust then Evelyn telling me seriously that Cody always calls his women by their full first names , Rosemarie , Joanna , Evelyn , Willamine , he never gives them silly nicknamesnor uses them ) . The meeting is not eventful , of course , both girls keep their silence and hardly look at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the usual boloney and I see that Cody is really very sick and tired of me bringinggangs arbitrarily to his place , running off with his mistress , getting drunk and thrown out of family plays , hundred dollars or no hundred dollars he probably feels I 'm just a fool now anyway and hopelessly lost forever but I dint realize that myself because I 'm feeling good Iwant us to resume down that road singing bawdier and darker songs till we 're negotiating narrow mountain roads at the pitch of the greatest songs . I try to ask Cody about Perry and all the other strange characters who visit Billie in the City but he just looks at me out of the corner eye and says " Ah , yah , hm , " I do nt know and I never will know what he 's up to anyway in the long run : I realize I 'm just a silly stranger goofing with other strangers for no reason far away from anything that ever mattered to me whatever that was Always anephemeral " visitor " to the Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm always ready to fly back across the country but not to any life of my own on the other end either , just a traveling stranger like Old Bull Balloon , an exemplar of the loneliness of Doren Coitp179actually waiting for the only real trip , to Venus , to the mountain of Mien Mo Tho when I look out of Cody'slivingroom window just then I do see my star still shining for me as it 's done all these 38 years over crib , out ship windows , jail windows , over sleepingbags only now it 's dummier and dimmer and getting blurreder damnit as tho even my own star be now fading away from concern forme as I from concern for it In fact we 're all strangerswith strange eyes sitting in a midnight livingroom fornothing And small talk at that , like Billie saying " Ialways wanted a nice fireplace " and I 'm yelling " Do nt worry we got one at the cabin hey Dave ? and all the wood 's chopped ! " and Evelyn : - " What does Monsanto think of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there alone in secret ? " " It 's too late now ! " I sing swigging from the bottle without which I 'd only drop with shame face flat on the floor or on the gaveldriveway And Dave and Romana look a little uneasyfinally so we all get up to go , zoom , and that 's the last time I see Cody or Evelyn anyway . And as I say our songs grow mightier as the road grows darker and wilder , finally here we are on the canyon road the headlights just reaching out there around bleak sandshoulders Down to the creek where I unlock the corralgate Across the meadow and back to the hauntedcabin Where on the strength of that night 's booze andgetaway gladness Billie and I actually have a good time lighting fires and making coffee and gong to be together in the one sleepingbag easy as pie after we 've bundled up little Elliott and Dave and Romana have retired in his double nylon bag by the creek in the moonlight . No , it 's the next day and night that concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upfeeling fair and going down to the creek to slurp up water in my palms and wash up , seeing the languid waving of one large brown thigh over the mass of Dave 's nylons indicative of an early morning love scene , in fact Romana telling us later at breakfast " When I woke up this morning and saw all those trees and water and clouds I told Dave It 's a beautiful universe we created  --  A real Adamand Eve waking up , in fact this being one of Dave 's gladdestdays because he 'd really wanted to get away from the City again anyway and this time with a pretty doll , and 's brought his surf casting gear planning a big day And we 've brought a lot of good food The only troubleis there 's no more wine so Dave and Romana go off in Willie to get some more anyway at a store 13 milessouth down the highway Billie and I are alone talkingby the fire I begin to feel extremely low as soon as lastnight 's alcohol wears off.  |p181Everything  is trembly again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire and Billie has to do it " Icant light a fire any more ! " I yell " Well I can " shesays in a rare instance when she lets me have it for beingsuch a nut Little Elliott is constantly pulling at herasking this and that , " What is that stick for , to put in the fire ? why ? how does it burn ? why does it burn ? where are we ? when are we leaving " and the pattern develops where she begins to talk to him instead of me anyway because I 'm just sitting there staring at the floor sighing Laterwhen he takes his nap we go down the path to the beach , about noon , both of us sad and silent " What 's the matter I wonder " I say out loud She : - " Everything was alright last night when we slept in the bag together now you wont even hold my hand . . . goddamit I 'm going tokill myself ! " Because I 've begun to realize in my sobernessthat this thing has come too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm leading her on , that I made a mistake dragging everyone here , that I simply wanta go home now , I 'm just plumb sick and tired just like Cody I guess of the whole nervewracking scene bad enough as it is always pivoting back to this poor haunted canyon which again gives me the willies as we walk under the bridge and come to those heartless breakers busting in on sand higher than earth and looking like the heartlessness ofwisdom Besides I suddenly notice as if for the firsttime the awful way the leaves of the canyon that have managed to be blown to the surf are all hesitantly advancingin gusts of wind then finally plunging into the surf , to be dispersed and belted and melted and taken off to seaI turn around and notice how the wind is just harryingthem off trees and into the sea , just hurrying them asp182it were to death In my condition they look humantrembling to that brink Hastening , hastening Inthat awful huge roar blast of autumn Sur wind . Boom , clap , the waves are still talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever said or ever will say Billie wants me to stroll with her down towards the caves but I do nt want to get up from the sand where I 'm sittingback to boulder She goes alone I suddenly rememberJames Joyce and stare at the waves realizing " All summer you were sitting here writing the so called sound of the waves not realizing how deadly serious our life and doom is , you fool , you happy kid with a pencil , dontyou realize you 've been using words as a happy game all those marvelous skeptical things you wrote about graves and sea death it 's ALL TRUE YOU FOOL ! Joyce is dead ! The sea took him ! it will take YOU ! " and I look down the beach and there 's Billie wading in the treacherousundertow , she 's already groaned several times earlier ( seeing my indifference and also of course the hopelessnessat Cody 's and the hopelessness of her wrecked apartment and wretched life ) " Someday I 'm going to commit suicide , " I suddenly wonder if she 's going to horrify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thoseawful undertows I see her sad blonde hair flying , thesad thin figure , alone by the sea , the leaf-hastening sea , she suddenly reminds me of something I rememberher musical sighs of death and I see the words clearly imprinted in my mind over her figure in the sand : - ST . CAROLYN BY THE SEA " You were my last chance " she 's said but do nt all women say that ? But can it beby " last chance " she does nt mean mere marriage but some profoundly sad realization of something in me she reallyp183needs to go on living , at least that impression coming across anyway on the force of all the gloom we 've shared Can it be I 'm withholding from her something sacredjust like she says , or am I just a fool who 'll never learn to have a decent eternally minded deepdown relation with a woman and keep throwing that away for a song at abottle ? In which case my own life is over anyway andthere are the Joycean waves with their blank mouths saying " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves hurryingone by one down the sand and dumping in In fact thecreek is freighting hundreds more of them a minute rightdirect from the back hills That big wind blasts androars , it 's all yellow sunny and blue fury everywhere I see the rocks wobble as it seems God is really getting mad for such a world and 's about to destroy it : big cliffs wobbling in my dumb eyes : God says " It 's gone too far , you 're all destroying everything one way or the other wobble boom the end is NOW . " " The Second Coming , tick tock , " I think shuddering St.Carolyn by the Sea is going in further I couldrun and go see her but she 's so far away I realize thatif that nut is going to try this I 'll have to make an awfulrun and swim to get her I get up and edge over butjust then she turns around and starts back . . . " And if I call her that nut ' in my secret thoughts wonder what she callsme ? " 0 hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts I'ddrown myself in that tiresome water but that wouldnt be getting it over at all , I can just see the big transformations and plans jellying down there to curse us up in some otherwretched suffering form eternities of it I guess that'swhat the kid feels She looks so sad down there wanderingOphelialike in bare feet among thunders.  |p184On  top of that now here come the tourists , people from other cabins in the canyon , it 's the sunny season and they 're out two three times a week , what a dirty look I get from the elderly lady who 's apparently heard about the " author " who was secretly invited to Mr. Monsanto 's cabin but instead brought gangs and bottles and today worst of all trollopes ( Because in fact earlier thatmorning Dave and Romana have already made love on the sand in broad daylight visible not only to others down the beach but from that high new cabin on the shoulder of the cliff ) ( tho hidden from sight from the bridge bycliffwall ) So it 's all well known news now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not evenhere This elderly lady being accompanied by childrenof all kinds So that when Billie returns from the farend of the beach and starts back with me down the path ( and I 'm silly with a big footlong wizard pipe in my mouth trying to light it in the wind to cover up ) the lady gives her the once over real close but Billie only smiles lightly like a little girl and chirps hello . I feel like the most disgraceful and nay disreputable wretch on earth , in fact my hair is blowing in beastly streaks across my stupid and moronic face , the hangover has now worked paranoia into me down to the last pitiable detail . Back at the cabin I cant chop wood for fear I 'll cut a foot off , I cant sleep , I cant sit , I cant pace , I keep going to the creek to drink water till finally I 'm going down there a thousand times making Dave Wain wonder as he 's come back with more wine We sit there slugging out of our separate bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to drink just the one bottle and he thep185other But he 's gay " I am now going out surf castinand catch us a grabbag of fish for a marvelous supper ; Romana you get the salad ready and anything else you can think of ; we 'll leave you alone now " he adds to gloomy me and Billie thinking he 's in our way , " and say , why do nt we go to Nepenthe and private our grief tonight and enjoy the moonlight on the terrace with Manhattans , or go seeHenry Miller ? " " No ! " I almost yell , " I mean I 'm soexhausted I do nt wanta do anything or see anybody " ( already feeling awful guilt about Henry Miller anyway , we 've made an appointment with him about a week ago and instead of showing up at his friend 's house in Santa Cruz at seven we 're all drunk at ten calling long distance and poor Henry just said " Well I 'm sorry I do nt get to meet you Jack but I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go to bed , you 'd never make it here till after midnight now " ) ( his voice on the phone just like on his records , nasal , Brooklyn , goodguy voice , and him disappointed in a way because he 's gone to the trouble of writing the preface to one of my books ) ( tho I suddenly now think in my remorseful paranoias " Ah the hell with it he was only gettin in the act like all these guys write prefaces so you do nt even get to read the author first " ) ( as an example of how really psychotically suspicious and loco I was getting ) . Alone with Billie 's even worse " I cant see anything to do now , " she says by the fire like an ancient Salemhousewife ( " Or Salem witch ? " I 'm leering ) " I couldhave Elliott taken care of in a private home or an orphanageand just go to a nunnery myself , there 's a lot of themaround or I could kill myself and Elliott both " " Do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talkp186when there 's no more directions to take " " You " ve gotme all wrong I wouldnt be any good for you " " I know that now , you want to be a hermit you say but you do nt do it much I noticed , you 're just tired of life and wanta sleep , in a way that 's how I feel too only I 've got Elliott to worry about ... I could take both our lives and solvethat " " You , creepy talk " " You told me the first night you loved me , that I was most interesting , that you had nt met anyone you liked so much then you just went on drinking , I really can see now what they say about you is true : and all the others like you : 0 I realize you 're a writer and suffer through too much but you 're really ratty sometimes ... but even that I know you cant help and I know you 're not really ratty but awfully broken up like you explained to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick you are , you really do nt think about others enough and I KNOW you cant help it , it 's a curious disease a lot of us have anyway only better hiddensometimes ... but what you said the first night and even just now about me being St.Carolyn in the Sea , why do nt you follow through with what your heart knows is Good and best and true , you give up so easy to discouragement ... then I guess too you do nt really want me and just wanta go home and resume your own life maybe withLouise your girlfriend " " No I could n't with her either , I 'm just bound up inside like constipation , I cant move emotionally like you 'd say emotionally as tho that was some big grand magic mystery everybody saying O how wonderful life is , how miraculous , God made this and God made that , ' how do you know he does nt hate what He did : He might even be drunk and not noticing what he went and done tho of course that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , God cant be dead because He 's theunborn " " But you have all those philosophies andsutras you were talking about " " But do nt you see they 've all become empty words , I realize I 've been playinglike a happy child with words words words in a bigserious tragedy , look around " " You could make someeffort , damn it ! " But what 's even ineffably worse is that the more she advises me and discussed the trouble the worse and worse it gets , it 's as tho she did nt know what she was doing , like an unconscious witch , the more she tries to help the more I tremble almost too realizing she 's doing it on purposeand knows she 's witching me but it 's all got ta be formally understood as " help " dingblast it She mustbe some kind of chemical counterpart to me , I just cant stand her for a minute , I 'm racked with guilt because all the evidence there seems to say she 's a wonderful person sympathizing in her quiet sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiltsstick All I feel is the invisible stab from her She'shurting me ! At some points in our conversation I 'm averitable ham actor jumping up to twitch my head , that'sthe effect she has " What 's the matter ? " she asks softly Which makes me almost scream and I 've neverscreamed in my life It 's the first time in my life I'mnot confident I can hold myself together no matter what happens and be inly calm enough to even smile with condescension at the screaming hysterias of women inmadwards I 'm in the same madward all of a sudden And what 's happened ? what 's caused it " Are youdriving me mad on purpose ? " I finally blurt But naturallyshe protests I 'm talking out of my head , there 's noP188such evident intention anywhere , we 're just on a happy weekend in the country with friends , " Then there 's something wrong with ME ! " I yell " That 's obvious but whydont you try to calm down and for instance like make love to me , I 've been begging you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tho I was an ugly old bat " She comes and offers herself to me softly and gently butI just stare at my quivering wrists It 's really very awfulIt 's hard to explain Besides then the little boy isconstantly coming at Billie when she kneels at my lap or sits on it or tries to soothe my hair and comfort me , he keeps saying in the same pitiful voice " Do nt do it Billie do nt do it Billie do nt do it Billie " till finally she has to give up that sweet patience of hers where she answers his every little pathetic question and yell " Shut up ! Elliott will you shut up ! DO I have to beat you again ! " and I groan " No ! " but Elliott yells louder " Do nt do it Billie do nt do it Billie do nt do it Billie ! " so she sweeps him off and starts whacking him screamingly on the porch and I am about to throw in the towel and gasp up my last , it 's horrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be yelling madwoman things like " I 'll kill both of us if you do nt stop , you leave me no alternative ! 0 my child ! " suddenly picking him up and embracing him rocking tears , and gnashing of hair and all under those old peaceful bluejay trees where in fact the jays are still waiting for their food and watching all this Even soAlf the Sacred Burro is in the yard waiting for somebody to give him an apple I look up at the sun going downgolden throughout the insane shivering canyon , that blasted rogue wind comes topping down trees a mile awayP189with an advancing roar that when it hits the broken cries of mother and son in grief are blown away with all those crazy scattering leaves The creek screechesA door bangs horribly , a shutter follows suit , the houseshakes I 'm beating my knees in the din and cant evenhear that . " What 's I got to do with you committing suicide anyway ? " I 'm yelling " Alright , it has nothing to do withyou " " So okay you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliott , he 'll grow up and be okay , you can always meanwhile go on with your job , get married , move away , do something , maybe it 's Cody but more than that I 'd say it 's all those mad characters making youinsane and wanta kill yourself like that Perry " Do nt talk about Perry , he 's wonderful and sweet and I love him and he 's much kinder to me than you 'll ever be : at least he gives of himself " " But what 's all this giving of ourselves , what 's there to give that 'll helpanybody " You 'll never know you 're so wrapped upin yourself " We 're now starting to insult each other which would be a healthy sign except she keeps breakingdown and crying on my shoulder more or less againinsisting I 'm her last chance ( which isnt true ) " Let'sgo to a monastery together , " she adds madly " Evelyn , I mean Billie you might go to a nunnery at that , by God get thee to a nunnery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe that 's what you need all that talk about Cody about religion maybe all this worldly horror is just holding you back from what you call your true realizing , you could become a big reverend mother someday with not a worry on your mind tho I met a reverend mother once whocried . . . ah it 's all so sad " " What did she cry about ? "  | " I do nt know , after talking to me , I remember I said some silly thing like the universe is a woman because it 's round ' but I think she cried because she was rememberingher early days when she had a romance with some soldier who died , at least that 's what they say , she was the greatest woman I ever saw , big blue eyes , big smart woman ... you could do that , get out of this awful mess and leave it all behind " " But I love lovetoo much for that " " And not because you 're sensualeither you poor kid " In fact we quiet down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling at her " Billie do nt do it do nt do it Billie do nt do it " till right in the middle I 'm yelling " Do nt do what ? what 's hemean ? can it be he 's right and Billie you shouldnt doit ? can it be we 're sinning after all 's said and done ? 0 thisis insane ! but he 's the most insane of them all , " infact the child is up on bed with us tugging at her shoulder just like a grownup jealous lover tryin to pull a woman off another man ( she being on top indication of exactly how helpless and busted down I 've become and here itis only 4 in the afternoon ) A little drama going onin the cabin maybe a little different than what cabins are intended for or the local neighbors are imagining.  |p191BUT  THERE 'S AN AWFUL PARANOIAC ELEMENT SOMETIMESin orgasm that suddenly releases not sweet genteel sympathybut some token venom that splits up in the body I feel a great ghastly hatred of myself and everything , the empty feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been robbed of my spinal power right downthe middle on purpose by a great witching force Ifeel evil forces gathering down all around me , from her , the kid , the very walls of the cabin , the trees , even the sudden thought of Dave Wain and Romana is evil , they'reall coming now I leave poor Billie face in hand andrush off to drink water in the creek but every time I do something like that I have to run back to be sorry and say so , but the moment I see her again " She 's doingsomething else " I leer and I do nt feel sorry at all She 's mumbling face in hands and the little boy 's cryingat her side " My God she should get to a nunnery ! " I think rushing back to the creek Suddenly the waterp192in the creek tastes different as tho somebody 's thrown gasoline or kerosene in it upstream " Maybe thoseneighbors wanta get back at me that 's what ! " I tastethe water carefully and I 'm positive that 's what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring when Dave Wain comes striding down with one fish on the line and his big cheerful western twang as tho nothing unusual'shappened " Well boy I spent a whole two hours and look what I got ! one measly but beautiful pathetic as you 'll see holy little rainbow sea trout that I 'm now going to clean Now the way to clean fish is as follows , " and he kneels innocently by the creek to show mehow I have nothing else to do but watch and smileHe says : " Be prepared to be taken on tour of FarolloneIsland within next two years , boy , with wild canaries actually lighting on your boat hundreds of miles out at sea See I 'm tryna to save money for a fishboat of my own , I think fishing is bettern anything and I intend to entirely reorganize my life for this tho I see the stern image of Fagan shrieking with a Roshi stick , but you ought to see how fast you can bait up hundreds of herring and clean salmon in one and a half minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hickory shirts and wool knit caps Man I know all about it and I 'm writing a final definitivearticle on how clean hard work is the saviour of us all  --  When you 're out there it 's a very primal light , fishingis You 're a hunter Birds find fish for you Weather drives you Foolish mind-hangs dissolve beforeutter fatigue and everything comes in " As I squatthere I imagine maybe Billie is telling Romana what happened in the cabin and Dave 'll know in a while thohe seems to know a lot that 's going on He 's hintedp193several times , like now , " You look like you 're having the worse time of your life , that kid Elliott is enough to drive anybody crazy and Billie is sure a nervous little wenchNow here 's the way you scale , with this here knife " And I marvel that I cant be so useful and humanlysimple and good enough to make small talk to make others feel better , like Dave , there he is long and hollow of cheeks from long drinking himself the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner like me , at least he does something about it , he puts himself to the test He gives me that feeling again that I'mthe only person in the world who is devoid of humanbeingness , damn it , that 's true , that 's the way I feel anyway " AhDave someday you and me 'll go fishing inyour abandoned mining camp on the Rogue River , huh , we 'll be feeling better by then somehow gaddamit " " Well we 've got to cut down on the sauce a whole lot , Jack , " saying " Jack " sadly a lot like Jarry Wagner used to do on our Dharmabumming mountain climbs where we 'd confide dolors , " yes , and we drink too many SWEET drinks in a way , you know all that sugar and no food is bound to upset your metabolism and fill your blood with sugar to the point where you ai nt got the strength of a hen ; you especially you 've been drinking nothin but sweetport and sweet Manhattans now for weeks I promise you the holy flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle ) . I suddenly look at the fish and feel horrible all over again , that old death scheme is back only now I 'm gon na put my big healthy Anglosaxon teeth into it and wrench away at the mournful flesh of a little living being that only an hour ago was swimming happily in the sea , inp194fact even Dave thinking this and saying : " Ah yes that little muzzling mouth was blindly sucking away in the glad waters of life and now look at it , here 's where the fittin head 's chopped off , you do nt have to look , us big drunken sinners are now going to use it for our sacrificial supper so in fact when we cook it I 'm going to say an Indian prayer for it hoping it 's the same prayer the localIndians used Jack in a way we might even start havinfun here and make a great week out of it !

I 'm going crazy with Billie and Elliott and me too . . . maybe I 'll have to , maybe we'llhave to leave or something , I think I 'll die here " AndDave is disappointed naturally and here I 've already routed him up out of his own affairs to drive down here anyway , another matter to make me feel like a rat.  |p195BUT  DAVE 'S MAKING THE BEST of clomping up and down thecabin preparing the bag of cornmeal and starting the corn oil in the frying pan , Romana too she 's making an exquisite big salad with lots of mayonnaise and in fact poor Billie is mutely helping her setting the table and the little boy is crooning by the stove it 's almost like ahappy domestic scene suddenly Only I watch it fromthe porch with horrified eyes Also because their shadowsin the lamplight gone casting on the walls look huge and monsterlike and witch-like and warlock-like , I 'm alone in the woods with happy ghosts The windis howling as the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at once again madly to my creek , always thinking the creek itself will give me water that will clear away everything and reassure me forever ( also remembering in my distress Edgar Cayce 's advice " Drink a lot of water " ) but " There 's kerosene in the water !

" " How did he look ? " They stared at each other . " All right . Tired , maybe . " " I 'll bet . " She sipped her drink ; her hand shook a little . " I do n't want to make a big fuss over nothing . I 'm sure he 's all right , wherever he is . I 'd just like to know . Our Mania and Daddy are having a fit : , and , " she laughed , catching hci breath roughly , " I guess I am , too . " She was silent . Then : " He 's the only big brother I got . " She sipped her drink , then she put it on the floor beside her chair . She played with the ruby-eyed snake ring on her long little finger . " I 'm sure he 's all right , " Cass said , miserably aware of the empty sound of the words , " it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I know . When something goes wrong . when he gets hurt , he just wants to go and hide until its over . He licks his wounds . Then he comes back . " She looked to Richard for help . He did his best . " I think Cass may be right , " he murmured . " I 've been everywhere , " said Ida , " everywhere he ever played , I been talking to everybody I could find who ever worked with him , anybody I could find he 'd even ever said hello to  --  I even tried relatives in Brooklyn  --  " She stopped and turned to Vivaldo . " When you saw him  --  where did he say he 'd been ? " " He did n't say . " " Did n't you ask him ? " " Yes . He would n't say . " " I gave you a phone number to call the minute you saw him . Why did n't you call me ? " " It was late when he came to my house , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to see you in the morning ! " He sounded helpless and close to tears . She stared at him , then dropped her eyes . The silence began to crawl with an acrid , banked hostility emanating from the girl who sat alone , in the round chair , in the center of the room . Shep101looked in turn at each of her brother 's friends . " It 's funny he did n't make it , then , " she said . " Well , Rufus does n't talk much , " said Richard . " You must know how hard it is to get anything out of him . " " Well , " she said , shortly , " I would have got it out of him . " " You 're his sister , " Cass said , gently . " Yes , " Ida said , and looked down at her hands . " Have you been to the police ? " Richard asked . " Yes . " She made a gesture of disgust and rose and walked to the window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running off from their families . They said they 'd try to find him . But they do n't care . They do n't care what happens  --  to a black man ! " " Oh , well , now , " cried Richard , his face red , " is that fair ? I mean , hell , I 'm sure they 'll look for him just like they look for any other citizen of this city . " She looked at him . " How would you know ? I do know  --  know what I 'm talking about . I say they do n't care  --  and they do n't care . " " I do n't think you should look at it like that . " She was staring out cf the window . " Goddamnit . He 's out there somewhere . I 've got to find him . " Her back was to the room . Cass watched her shoulders begin to shake . She went to the window and put her hand on Ida 's arm . " I 'm all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pocket of her suit , then crossed to where she had been sitting and pulled Kleenex out of her handbag . She dried her eyes and blew her nose and picked up her drink . Cass stared at her helplessly . " Let me freshen it for you , " she said , and took the glass into the kitchen . " Ida , " Vivaldo was saying as she re-entered , " if there 's anything I can do to help you find him  --  anything at all  --  " He stopped . " Hell , " he said , " I love him , too , I want to find him , too . I 've been kicking myself all day for letting him get away last night . " When Vivaldo said , " I love him , too , " Ida looked overp102at him , her eyes very big , as though she were , now , really meeting him for the first time . Then she dropped her eyes . " I do n't really know anything you can do , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . We could look together . " She considered this ; she considered him . " Well , " she said , finally , " maybe you could come with me to a couple of places in the Village " All right . " " I ca n't help it . I have the feeling they think I 'm just being hysterical . " " I 'll come with you . They wo n't think I 'm hysterical . " Richard grinned . " Vivaldo 's never hysterical , we all know that . " Then he said , " I really do n't see the point of all this . Rufus is probably just sleeping it off somewhere . " " Nobody 's seen him , " Ida cried , " for nearly six weeks ! Until last night ! I know my brother , he does n't do things like this . He always come by the house , no matter where he 'd been , or what was happening , just so we would n't worry . He used to bring money and things  --  but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me he 's just sleeping it off somewhere . Six weeks is a long time . " She subsided a little , subsided to a venomous murmur . " And you know what happened  --  between him and that damn crazy little cracker bitch he got hung up with . " " All right , " Richard said , helplessly , after a considerable silence , " have it your own way . " Cass said , " But there 's no need to go rushing off in the rain right away . Rufus knows Vivaldo is going to be here . He may come by . I was hoping you would all stay for supper . " She smiled at Ida . " Wo n't you , please ? I 'm sure you 'll feel better . It may all be cleared up by this evening . " Ida and Vivaldo stared at each other , having , it seemed , become allies in the course of the afternoon . " Well ? " asked Vivaldo . " I do n't know . I 'm so tired and evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p103Richard  looked as though he thoroughly agreed with this ; and he said , " Look . You 've been to the police . You 've told everyone you could . You 've checked the hospitals , and "  --  he looked at her questioningly  --  " the morgue "  --  and she nodded , not dropping her eyes . " Well . I do n't see any point in rushing out in this damn Sunday-afternoon rain , when you hardly even know where you 're going . And we all saw him last night . So we know he 's around . So why not relax for a couple of hours ? Hell , in a couple of hours you may find out you have n't got to go anywhere , he 'll turn up . " " Really , " said Cass , " there 's a very good chance he 'll turn up here today . " Ida looked at Cass . Then Cass realized that something in Ida was enjoying this  --  the attention , the power she held for this moment . This made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means that whatever 's coming , she 'll be able to get through it . Without quite knowing it , from the moment Ida stepped through the door , she was preparing herself for the worst . " Well , " said Ida , looking at Vivaldo , " I asked Mama to call me here  --  just in case . " " Well , then , " said Cass , " it seems to me it 's settled . " She looked at the clock . " The boys should be home in about another hour . I think what I 'll do is fix us all a fresh drink . " Ida grinned . " That 's a very friendly idea . " She was terribly attractive when she grinned . Her face , then , made one think of a mischievous street boy . And at the same time there glowed in her eyes a marvelously feminine mockery . Vivaldo kept watching her , a small smile playing around the corners of his mouth . The snow which had been predicted for the day before Thanksgiving did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , halfhearted flakes , spinning and gleaming in the darkness , melting on the ground . All day long a cold sun glared down on Manhattan , giving no heat.  |p104Cass  woke a little earlier than usual , and fed the children and sent them off to school . Richard ate his breakfast and retired into his study  --  he was not in a good mood . Cass cleaned the house , thinking of tomorrow 's dinner , and went out in the early afternoon to shop and to walk for a little while alone . She was gone longer than she had intended , for she loved to walk around this city . She was chilled when at last she started home . They lived just below Twenty-third Street , on the West Side , in a neighborhood that had lately acquired many Puerto Ricans . For this reason it was said that the neighborhood was declining ; from what previous height it would have been hard to say . It seemed to Cass very much as it always had , run-down , and with a preponderance of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather liked them . They did not impress her as being rough ; they seemed , on the contrary , rather too gentle for their brutal environment . She liked the sound of their talk , soft and laughing , or else violently , clearly , brilliantly hostile ; she liked the life in their eyes and the way they treated their children , as though all children were naturally the responsibility of all grownups . Even when the adolescents whistled after her , or said lewd things as she passed and laughed among themselves , she did not become resentful or afraid ; she did not feel in it the tense New York hostility . They were not cursing something they longed for and feared , they were joking about something they longed for and loved . Now , as she labored up the outside steps of the building , one of the Puerto Rican boys she had seen everywhere in the neighborhood opened the door for her with a small , halfsmile . She smiled at him and thanked him as forthrightly as she could , and stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he closed the door behind her , and in the loud silence of the apartment . She looked at him and started to ask about the children  --  but then she heard them in the living room . Richard followed herp105into the kitchen and she put down her packages . She looked into his face . " What is it ? " she asked . Then , after the instant in which she checked off all the things it was n't , " Rufus , " she said , suddenly , " you 've got news about Rufus . " " Yes . " She watched the way a small vein in his forehead fluttered . " He 's dead , Cass . They found his body floating in the river . " She sat down at the kitchen table . " When ? " " Sometime this morning . " " How long  --  how long ago  --  ? " " A few days . They figured he must have jumped off the George Washington Bridge . " " My God , " she said . Then : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just after you went out . Ida had called him . " " My God , " she said , again , " it 's going to kill that poor girl . " He paused . " Vivaldo sounded as though he 'd just been kicked in the belly by a horse . " " Where is he ? " " I tried to make him come here . But he was going uptownto the girl  --  Ida  --  I do n't know what good he can do . " " Well . He was much closer to Rufus than we were . " " Would you like a drink ? " " Yes , " she said , " I think I 'd like a drink . " She sat staring at the table . " I wonder if there was anything  --  we  --  anyonecouldhave done . " " No , " he said , pouring a little whiskey in a glass and setting it before her , " there was nothing anyone could have done . It was too late . He wanted to die . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the sunlight fell on the table . Richard put his hand on her shoulder . " Do n't take it too hard , Cass . After all She remembered his face as it had been the last time shep106talked to him , the look in his eyes , and his smile when he asked Can I come to see you soon ? How she wished , now , that she had stayed and talked to him a little longer . Perhaps  --  she sipped the whiskey , marveling that the children were so quiet . Tears filled her eyes and dropped slowly down her face , onto the table . " It 's a dirty , rotten shame , " she said . " It 's a terrible , terrible , terrible thing . " " He was heading that way , " said Richard , mildly , " nothing , no one , could have stopped him . " " How do we know that ? " Cass asked . " Oh , honey , you know what he 's been like these last few months . We hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? she wanted to ask . Just what in hell did everybody know ? But she dried her eyes and stood up . " Vivaldo tried like hell to stop what he was doing to Leona . And if he could have stopped him from doing that  --  well , then , maybe he could have stopped this , too . " That 's true , she thought , and looked at Richard , who , under stress , could always surprise her into taking his measure again . " I was very fond of him , " she said , helplessly . " There was something very sweet in him . " He looked at her with a faint smile . " Well , I guess you 're just naturally nicer than I am . I did n't think that . I thought he was a pretty self-centered character , if you want the truth . " " Oh , well , " she said , " self-centered  --  ! We do n't know a soul who is n't . " " You 're not , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat them right . You spend your life trying to take care of the children  --  and me  --  " " Oh , but you are my life  --  you and the children . What would I do , what would I be , without you ? I 'm just as selfcenteredas anybody else . Ca n't you see that ? " He grinned and rubbed his hand roughly over her head . " No . And I 'm not going to argue about it any more . " But , after a moment , he persisted . " I did n't love Rufus , not thep107way you did , the way all of you did . I could n't help feeling , anyway , that one of the reasons all of you made such a kind of  --  fuss -- over him was partly just because he was colored . Which is a hell of a reason to love anybody . I just had to look on him as another guy . And I could n't forgive him for what he did to Leona . You once said you could n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it since then . I 've thought about it since then . " " And what have you thought ? You find a way to justify it ? " " No . I was n't trying to justify it . It ca n't be justified . But now I think  --  oh , I just do n't know enough to be able to judge him . He must  --  he must have been in great pain . He must have loved her . " She turned to him , searching his face . " I 'm sure he loved her . " " Some love , " he said . " Richard , " she said , " you and I have hurt each other  --  many times . Sometimes we did n't mean to and sometimes we did . And was n't it because  --  just because  --  we loved  --  loveeachother ? " He looked at her oddly , head to one side . " Cass , " he said , " how can you compare it ? We 've never tried to destroy each other  --  have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've never tried to destroy you . Have you ever tried to destroy me ? " She thought of his face as it had been when they met ; and watched it now . She thought of all they had discovered together and meant to each other , and of how many small lies had gone into the making of their one , particular truth : this love , which bound them to one another . She had said No , many times , to many things , when she knew she might have said Yes , because of Richard ; believed many things , because of Richard , which she was not sure she really believed . He had been absolutely necessary to her  --  or so she had believed ; it came to the same thing  --  and so she had attached herself to him and her life had taken shape around him . She did notp108regret this for herself . I want him , something in her had said , years ago . And she had bound him to her ; he had been her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret it for herself and yet she began to wonder if there were not something in it to be regretted , something she had done to Richard which Richard did not see . " No , " she said , faintly . And then , irrepressibly , " But I would n't have had to try . " " What do you mean by that ? " " I mean "  --  he was watching her ; she sat down again , playing with the glass of whiskey  --  " a man meets a woman . And he needs her . But she uses this need against him , she uses it to undermine him . And it 's easy . Women do n't see men the way men want to be seen . They see all the tender places , all the places where blood could flow . " She finished the whiskey . " Do you see what I mean ? " " No , " he said , frankly , " I do n't . I do n't believe all this female intuition shit . It 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and in such a tone ! " She mimicked him : " Something women have dreamed up . But I ca n't say that  --  what men have dreamed up ' is all there is , the world they 've dreamed up is the world . " He laughed . She subsided . " Well . It 's true . " " What a funny girl you are , " he said . " You 've got a bad case of penis envy . " " So do most men , " she said , sharply , and he laughed . " All I meant , anyway , " she said , soberly , " is that I had to try to fit myself around you and not try to make you fit around me . That 's all . And it has n't been easy . " " No . " " No . Because I love you . " " Ah ! " he said , and laughed aloud , " you are a funny girl . I love you , too , you know that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know me so well and you do n't know that ? Whatp109happened to all that intuition , all that  --  specialized  --  point of view ? " " Beyond a certain point , " she said , with a sullen smile , " it does n't seem to work so well . " He pulled her up from the table and put both arms around her , bending his cheek to her hair . " What point is that , my darling ? " Everything , his breath in her hair , his arms , his chest , his odor  --  was familiar , confining , unutterably dear . She turned her head slightly to look out of the kitchen window . " Love , " she said , and watched the cold sunlight . She thought of the cold river and of the dead black boy , their friend . She closed her eyes . " Love , " she said , again , " love . " Richard stayed with the children Saturday , while Cass and Vivaldo went uptown to Rufus ' funeral . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who knew that he had to be there but dreaded being there alone . It was a morning funeral , and Rufus was to be driven to the graveyard immediately afterward . Early on that cold , dry Saturday , Vivaldo arrived , emphatically in black and white : white shirt , black tie , black suit , black shoes , black coat ; and black hair , eyes , and eyebrows , and a dead-white , bone-dry face . She was struck by his panic and sorrow ; without a word , she put on her dark coat and put her hand in his ; and they rode down in the elevator in silence . She watched him in the elevator mirror . Sorrow became him . He was reduced to his beauty and elegance  --  as bones , after a long illness , come forward through the flesh . They got into a taxi and started uptown . Vivaldo sat beside her , his hands on his knees , staring straight ahead . She watched the streets . Traffic was heavy , but rolling ; the cab kept swerving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop . Then , at Thirty-fourth Street , the red light brought it to a halt . They were surrounded by a violence of cars , great trucks , green buses lumbering across town , and boys , dark boys , pushing wooden wagons full ofp110clothes . The people on the sidewalks overflowed into the streets . Women in heavy coats moved heavily , carrying large packages and enormous handbags  --  for Thanksgiving was over but signs proclaimed the dwindling number of shopping days to Christmas . Men , relatively unburdened , pursuing the money which Christmas cost , hurried around and past the women ; boys in ducktail haircuts swung over the cold black asphalt as though it were a dance floor . Outside the window , as close to her as Vivaldo , one of the colored boys stopped his wagon , lit a cigarette , and laughed . The taxi could not move and the driver began cursing . Cass lit a cigarette and handed it to Vivaldo . She lit another for herself . Then , abruptly , the taxi jerked forward . The driver turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of a guitar , a high , neighing voice , and a chorus , crying , " love me ! " The other words were swallowed in the guttural moans of the singer , which were nearly as obscene as the driver 's curses had been , but these two words kept recurring . " My whole family thinks I 'm a bum , " said Vivaldo . " I 'd say they 've given me up , except I know they 're scared to death of what I 'll do next . " She said nothing . He looked out of the cab window . They were crossing Columbus Circle . " Sometimes  --  like today , " he said , " I think they 're probably right and I 've just been kidding myself . About every-thing . " The walls of the park now closed on either side of them and beyond these walls , through speed and barren trees , the walls of hotels and apartment buildings . " My family thinks I married beneath me , " she said . " Beneath them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . " I do n't think I ever saw my father sober , " he said , " not in all these years . He used to say , I want you to tell me the truth now , always tell me the truth . ' And then , if I told him the truth , he 'd slap me up against the wall . So , naturally , Ip111did n't tell him the truth , I 'd just tell him any old lie , I did n't give a shit . The last time I went over to the house to see them I was wearing my red shirt , and he said , What 's the matter , you turned queer ? ' Jesus . " She lit another cigarette and she listened . There was a horseback rider on the bridle path , a pale girl with a haughty , bewildered face . Cass had time to think , unwillingly , as the rider vanished forever from sight , that it might have been herself , many years ago , in New England . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to be tough , they 'd kill you if you were n't , people were dying around us all the time , for nothing . I was n't really much interested in hanging out with most of those kids , they bored me . But they scared me , too . I could n't stand watching my father . He 's such an awful coward . He spent all his time pretending  --  well , I do n't know what he was pretending , that everything was great , I guess  --  while his wife was going crazy in the hardware store we 've got . And he knew that neither me nor my brother had any respect for him . And his daughter was turning into the biggest cock teaser going . She finally got married , I hate to think what her husband must have to promise her each time she lets him have a little bit . " He was silent for a moment . Then , " Of course , he 's an asshole , too . Lord . I used to like to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town by myself and just walk around or go to the movies by myself or just read or just goof . But , no . You had to be a man where I come from , and you had to prove it , prove it all the time . But I could tell you things " He sighed . " Well , my Dad 's still there , sort of helping to keep the liquor industry going . Most of the kids I knew are dead or in jail or on junk . I 'm just a bum ; I 'm lucky . " She listened because she knew that he was going back over it , looking at it , trying to put it all together , to understand it , to express it . But he had not expressed it . He had left something of himself back there on the streets of Brooklynwhich he was afraid to look at again.  | " One time , " he said , " we got into a car and drove over to the Village and we picked up this queer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn . Poor guy , he was scared green before we got halfway there but he could n't jump out of the car . We drove into this garage , there were seven of us , and we made him go down on all of us and then we beat the piss out of him and took all his money and took his clothes and left him lying on that cement floor , and , you know , it was winter . " He looked over at her , looked directly at her for the first time that morning . " Sometimes I still wonder if they found him in time , or if he died , or what . " He put his hands together and looked out of the window . " Sometimes I wonder if I 'm still the same person who did those things  --  so long ago . " No . It was not expressed . She wondered why . Perhaps it was because Vivaldo 's recollections in no sense freed him from the things recalled . He had not gone back into it  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated , even romantichorror , and he was looking for a way to deny it . Perhaps such secrets , the secrets of everyone , were only expressed when the person laboriously dragged them into the light of the world , imposed them on the world , and made them a part of the world 's experience . Without this effort , the secret place was merely a dungeon in which the person perished ; without this effort , indeed , the entire world would be an uninhabitable darkness ; and she saw , with a dreadful reluctance , why this effort was so rare . Reluctantly , because she then realized that Richard had bitterly disappointed her by writing a book in which he did not believe . In that moment she knew , and she knew that Richard would never face it , that the book he had written to make money representedthe absolute limit of his talent . It had not really been written to make money  --  if only it had been ! It had been written because he was afraid , afraid of things dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care , she told herself , quickly . And : It 's not his fault if he 's not Dostoievski , I do n't care . But whether or notp113she cared did n't matter . He cared , cared tremendously , and he was dependent on her faith in him . " Is n't it strange , " she said , suddenly , " that you should be remembering all these things now ! " " Maybe , " he said , after a moment , " it 's because of her . When I went up there , the day she called me to say Rufus was dead  --  I do n't know  --  I walked through that block and I walked in that house and it all seemed  --  I do n't know  --  familiar . " He turned his pale , troubled face toward her but she felt that he was staring at the high , hard wall which stood between himself and his past . " I do n't just mean that I used to spend a lot of time in Harlem , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever there in the daytime anyway . I mean , there were the same kids on the block that used to be on my block  --  they were colored but they were the same , really the same  --  and , hell , the hallways have the same stink , and everybody 's , well , trying to make it but they know they have n't got much of a chance . The same old women , the same old men  --  maybe they 're a little bit more alive  --  and I walked into that house and they were just sitting there , Ida and her mother and her father , and there were some other people there , relatives , maybe , and friends . I do n't know , no one really spoke to me except Ida and she did n't say much . And they all looked at me as though  --  well , as though I had done it  --  and , oh , I wanted so bad to take that girl in my arms and kiss that look off her face and make her know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , whoever was doing it was doing it to me , too . " He was crying , silently , and he bent forward , hiding his face with one long hand . " I know I failed him , but I loved him , too , and nobody there wanted to know that . I kept thinking , They 're colored and I 'm white but the same things have happened , really the same things , and how can I make them know that ? " " But they did n't , " she said , " happen to you because you were white . They just happened . But what happens up here "  --  and the cab came out of the park ; she stretched her hands , inviting him to look  --  " happens because they arep114colored . And that makes a difference . " And , after a moment , she dared to add , " You 'll be kissing a long time , my friend , before you kiss any of this away . " He looked out of the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue , though their destination was on Seventh ; and nothing they passed was unfamiliar becauseeverything they passed was wretched . It was not hard to imagine that horse carriages had once paraded proudly up this wide avenue and ladies and gentlemen , ribboned , beflowered , brocaded , plumed , had stepped down from their carriages to enter these houses which time and folly had so blasted and darkened . The cornices had once been new , had once gleamed as brightly as now they sulked in shame , all tarnished and despised . The windows had not always been blind . The doors had not always brought to mind the distrust and secrecy of a city long besieged . At one time people had cared about these houses  --  that was the difference ; they had been proud to walk on this Avenue ; it had once been home , whereas now it was prison . Now , no one cared : this indifference was all that joined this ghetto to the mainland . Now , everything was falling down and the owners did n't care ; no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , and copper , all with a gray ash on their faces and legs from the cold wind , like the faint coating of frost on a window or a flower , did n't seem to care , that no one saw their beauty . Their elders , great , trudging , black women , lean , shuffling men , had taught them , by precept or example , what it meant to care or not to care : whatever precepts were daily being lost , the examples remained , all up and down the street . The trudging women trudged , paused , came in and out of dark doors , talked to each other , to the men , to policemen , stared into shop windows , shouted at the children , laughed , stopped to caress them . All the faces , even those of the children , held a sweet or poisonous disenchantment which made their faces extraordinarily definite , as though they had been struck out of stone . The cab sped uptown , past men in front of barberp115shops , in front of barbeque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , long , dark , noisome , with gray houses leaningforward to cut out the sky ; and in the shadow of these houses , children buzzed and boomed , as thick as flies on flypaper . Then they turned off the Avenue , west , crawled up a long , gray street . They had to crawl , for the street was choked with unhurrying people and children kept darting out from between the cars which were parked , for the length of the street , on either side . There were people on the stoops , people shouting out of windows , and young men peered indifferentlyinto the slow-moving cab , their faces set ironically and their eyes unreadable . " Did Rufus ever have you up here ? " she asked . " To visit his family , I mean . " " Yes , " said Vivaldo . " A long time ago . I had almost forgottenit . I had forgotten it until Ida reminded me . She was in pigtails then , the cutest little colored girl you ever saw . She was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She smiled at his description of Ida , and at his tone , which was unconsciously erotic . The cab crossed the Avenue and stopped on the far corner of the block they had come through , where the chapel stood . Two women stood on the steps of the chapel , talking together in low tones . As Cass watched and Vivaldo paid the driver , a young man joined them and they went inside . Suddenly , with a curse , she put her hand on her uncoveredhead . " Vivaldo , " she said , " I ca n't go in there . " He stared at her blankly , while the taxi driver paused in the act of handing him his change . " What 're you talking about ? " he asked . " What 's the matter with you ? " " Nothing . Nothing . But a woman 's head has to be covered . I ca n't go in there without a hat . " " Of course you can ! " But at the same moment he re/membered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church . " No , no , I ca n't . They 're all wearing hats , all of them . It would be an insult if I did n't , it would be like coming here in slacks . " She paused . " It 's a church , Vivaldo , it 's a funeral , it would be an insult . " He had already conceded her point and he stared at her helplessly . The cab driver still held the change and watched Vivaldo with a careful lack of expression . " Well , have n't you got a scarf , or something ? " " No . " She dug in her handbag , the pockets of her coat , close to tears . " No . Nothing . " " Listen , buddy , " the driver said . Vivaldo 's face lightened . " What about your belt ? Ca n't you tie that around your head ? It 's black . " " Oh , no . That 'll never work . Besides  --  they 'd know it was my belt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove her point , she took off her belt and tied it around her head . " You see ? It 'll never work . " " What 're you people going to do ? " the driver asked . " I ai n't got all day . " " I 'll have to buy something , " Cass said . " We 'll be late . " " Well , you go on in . I 'll just drive to a store somewhere and I 'll come right back . " " Ai n't no stores around here , lady , " the driver said . " Of course there are stores somewhere near here , " Cass said , sharply . " You go on in , Vivaldo ; I 'll come right back . What 's the address here ? " Vivaldo gave her the address and said , " You 'll have to go to 125th Street , that 's the only place I know where there are any stores . " Then he took his change from the driver and tipped him . " The lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The driver turned in his seat resignedly , and turnedp117on his meter . " You go on in , Vivaldo , " Cass said again . " I 'm sorry . I 'll be right back . " " You have enough money on you ? " " Yes . Go on in . " He got out of the cab , looking helpless and annoyed , and turned into the chapel as the cab pulled away . The driver left her at the corner of 125th Street and Eighth Avenue and she realized , as she hurried down the wide , crowded street , that she was in a strange , unnameable state , neither rage nor tears but close to both . One small , lone , white woman hurrying along 125th Street on a Saturday morning was apparently a very common sight , for no one looked at her at all . She did not see any stores with ladies hats in the window . But she was hurrying too fast and looking too hard . If she did not pull herself together , she might very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment she thought to stop one of the women  --  one of the women whose faces she watched as though they contained something it was necessary for her to learn  --  to ask directions . Then she realized that she was mysteriously afraid : afraid of these people , these streets , the chapel to which she must return . She forced herself to walk more slowly . She saw a store and entered it . A Negro girl came toward her , a girl with red , loosely waved hair , who wore a violently green dress and whose skin was a kind of dusty copper . " Can I help you ? " The girl was smiling , the same smile  --  as Cass insisted to herself  --  that all salesgirls , everywhere , have always worn . This smile made Cass feel poor and shabby indeed . But now she felt it more vehemently than she had ever felt it before . And though she was beginning to shake with a thoroughly mysterious anger , she knew that her dry , aristocratic sharpness , however well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual effect here . " I want , " she stammered , " to see a hat . " Then she remembered that she hated hats and neverp118wore them . The girl , whose smile had clearly been taught her by masters , looked as though she sold at least one hat , every Saturday morning , to a strange , breathless , white woman . " Will you come with me ? " she asked . " Well  --  no , " Cass said , suddenly  --  and the girl turned , impeccably made up eyebrows arched  --  " I mean , I do n't really want a hat . " Cass tried to smile ; she wanted to run . Silence had fallen over the shop . " I think I 'd just like to get a scarf . Black "  --  and how the word seemed to roll through the shop !  --  " for my head , " she added , and felt that in another moment they would call the police . And she had no way of identifying herself . " Oh , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Marie ! " she called , sharply , " will you take care of this lady ? " She walked away and another , older and plainer girl , who was also , however , very carefully dressed and made-up , came over to Cass , wearing a very different smile : a bawdy , amused smile , full of complicity and contempt . Cass felt herself blushing . The girl pulled out boxes of scarves . They all seemed sleazy and expensive , but she was in no position to complain . She took one , paid for it , tied it around her head , and left . Her knees were shaking . She managed to find a cab at the corner and , after fighting a small duel with herself , gave the driver the address of the chapel : she had really wanted to tell him to take her home . The chapel was small and there were not many people in it . She entered as silently as she could , but heads turned at her entrance . An elderly man , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down in the first seat she saw , in the very last row , near the door . Vivaldo was sitting further up , near the middle ; the only other white person , as far as she could tell , in the place . People sat rather scattered from each other  --  in the same way , perhaps , that the elements of Rufus ' life had been scattered  --  and this made the chapel seem emptier than it was . There were many young peoplep119there , Rufus ' friends , she supposed , the boys and girls who had grown up with him . In the front row sat six figures , the family : no amount of mourning could make Ida 's proud back less proud . Just before the family , just below the altar , stood the bier , dominating the place , mother of pearl , closed . Someone had been speaking as she came in , who now sat down . He was very young and he was dressed in the black robes of an evangelist . She wondered if he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a boy . But he moved with great authority , the authority indeed of someone who has found his place and made his peace with it . As he sat down , a very thin girl walked up the aisle and the boy in black robes moved to the piano at the side of the altar . " I remember Rufus , " the girl said , " from when he was a big boy and I was just a little girl  --  " and she tried to smile at the front-row mourners . Cass watched her , seeing that the girl was doing her best not to cry . "  --  me and his sister used to sit around trying to console each other when Rufus went off with the big boys and would n't let us play with him . " There was a murmur of amusement and sorrow and heads in the front row nodded . " We lived right next door to each other , he was like a brother to me . " Then she dropped her head and twisted a white handkerchief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hands . She was silent for several seconds and , once again , a kind of wind seemed to whisper through the chapel as though everyone there shared the girl 's memories and her agony and were willing her through it . The boy at the piano struck a chord . " Sometimes Rufus used to like me to sing this song , " the girl said , abruptly . " I 'll sing if for him now . " The boy played the opening chord . The girl sang in a rough , untrained , astonishingly powerful voice : I 'm a stranger , do n't drive me away . I 'm a stranger , do n't drive me away . If you drive me away , you may need me some day , I 'm a stranger , do n't drive me away.  |p120When  she finished she walked over to the bier and stood there for a moment , touching it lightly with both hands . Then she walked back to her seat . There was weeping in the front row . She watched as Ida rocked an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men blew his nose loudly . The air was heavy . She wished it were over . Vivaldo sat very still and alone , looking straight ahead . Now , a gray-haired man stepped forward from behind the altar . He stood watching them for a moment and the black-robed boy strummed a mournful hymn . " Some of you know me , " he said , finally , " and some of you do n't . My name is Reverend Foster . " He paused . " And I know some of your faces and some of you are strangers to me . " He made a brief bow , first toward Cass , then toward Vivaldo . " But ai n't none of us really strangers . We all here for the same reason . Someone we loved is dead . " He paused again and looked down at the bier . " Someone we loved and laughed with and talked with  --  and got mad at  --  and prayed over  --  is gone . He ai n't with us no more . He 's gone someplace where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bier again . " We ai n't going to look on his face again  --  no more . He had a hard time getting through this world and he had a rough time getting out of it . When he stand before his Maker he going to look like a lot of us looked when we first got here  --  like he had a rough time getting through the passage . It was narrow . " He cleared his throat and blew his nose . " I ai n't going to stand here and tell you all a whole lot of lies about Rufus . I do n't believe in that . I used to know Rufus , I knew him all his life . He was a bright kid and he was full of the devil and were n't no way in the world of keeping up with him . He got into a lot of trouble , all of you know that . A lot of our boys get into a lot of trouble and some of you know why . We used to talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friends , Rufus and me , even after he jumped up and went off from here and even though he did n't never attend church service like I  --   |p121we   --  all wanted him to do . " He paused again . " He had to go his way . He had his trouble and he 's gone . He was young , he was bright , he was beautiful , we expected great things from him  --  but he 's gone away from us now and it 's us will have to make the great things happen . I believe I know how terrible some of you feel . I know how terrible I feel  --  ai n't nothing I can say going to take away that ache , not right away . But that boy was one of the best men I ever met , and I been around awhile . I ai n't going to try to judge him . That ai n't for us to do . You know , a lot of people say that a man who takes his own life ought n't to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about that . All I know , God made every bit of ground I ever walked on and everything God made is holy . And do n't none of us know what goes on in the heart of someone , do n't many of us know what 's going on in our own hearts for the matter of that , and so ca n't none of us say why he did what he did . Ai n't none of us been there and so do n't none of us know . We got to pray that the Lord will receive him like we pray that the Lord 's going to receive us . That 's all . That 's all . And I tell you something else , do n't none of you forget it : I know a lot of people done took their own lives and they 're walking up and down the streets today and some of them is preaching the gospel and some is sitting in the seats of the mighty . Now , you remember that . If the world was n't so full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live would n't have to suffer so bad . " He walked up and down behind the altar , behind the bier . " I know there ai n't nothing I can say to you that sit before me  --  his mother and father , his sister , his kinfolks , his friends  --  to bring him back or to keep you from grieving that he 's gone . I know that . Ai n't nothing I can say will make his life different , make it the life that maybe some other man might have lived . It 's all been done , it 's all written down on high . But do n't lose heart , dear ones  --  do n't lose heart .  |p122understand  . The world 's already bitter enough , we got to try to be better than the world . " He looked down , then over to the front row . " You got to remember , " he said , gently , " he was trying . Ai n't many trying and all that tries must suffer . Be proud of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all he ever wanted in this world . " Except for someone  --  a man  --  weeping in the front row , there was silence all over the chapel . Cass thought that the man must be Rufus ' father and she wondered if he believed what the preacher said . What had Rufus been to him ?  --  a troublesome son , a stranger while living and now a stranger forever in death . And now nothing else would ever be known . Whatever else had been , or might have been , locked in Rufus ' heart or in the , heart of his father , had gone into oblivion with Rufus . It would never be expressed now . It was over . " There 're some friends of Rufus 's here , " said Reverend Foster , " and they going to play something for us and then we going to go . " Two young men walked up the aisle , one carrying a guitar , one carrying a bass fiddle . The thin dark girl followed them . The black-robed boy at the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the covered corpse , the girl stood a little away from them , near the piano . They began playing something Cass did not recognize , something very slow , and more like the blues than a hymn . Then it began to be more tense and more bitter and more swift . The people in the chapel hummed low in their throats and tapped their feet . Then the girl stepped forward . She threw back her head and closed her eyes and that voice rang out again : Oh , that great getting-up morning , Fare thee well , fare thee well ! Reverend Foster , standing on a height behind her , raised both hands and mingled his voice with hers :  |p123We  'll be coming from every nation , Fare thee well , fare thee well ! The chapel joined them , but the girl ended the song alone : Oh , on that great getting-up morning , Fare thee well , fare thee well ! Then Reverend Foster prayed a brief prayer for the safe journey of the soul that had left them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all the souls under the sound of his voice . It was over . The pallbearers , two of the men in the front row , and the two musicians , lifted the mother-of-pearl casket to their shoulders and started down the aisle . The mourners followed . Cass was standing near the door . The four still faces passed her with their burden and did not look at her . Directly behind them came Ida and her mother . Ida paused for a moment and looked at her  --  looked directly , unreadably at her from beneath her heavy veil . Then she seemed to smile . Then she passed . And the others passed . Vivaldo joined her and they walked out of the chapel . For the first time she saw the hearse , which stood on the Avenue , facing downtown . " Vivaldo , " she asked , " are we going to the cemetery ? " " No , " he said , " they do n't have enough cars . I think only the family 's going . " He was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already entered the car . She stood on the sidewalk . She looked around her , then walked swiftly over to them . She took each of them by one hand . " I just wanted to thank you , " she said , quickly , " for coming . " Her voice was rough from weeping and Cass could not see her face behind the veil . " You do n't know what it means to me  --  to us . " Cass pressed Ida 's hand , not knowing what to say . Vivaldo said , " Ida , anything we can do  --  anything I can do  --  anything  --  ! "  | " You 've done wonders . You been wonderful . I 'll never forget it . " She pressed their hands again and turned away . She got into the car and the door closed behind her . The hearse slowly moved out from the curb , and the car , then a second car , followed . Others who had been at the funeral service looked briefly at Cass and Vivaldo , stood together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cass and Vivaldo started down the Avenue . " Shall we take a subway ? " Vivaldo asked . " I do n't , " she said , " think I could face that now . " They continued to walk , nevertheless , aimlessly , in silence . Cass walked with her hands deep in her pockets , staring down at the cracks in the sidewalk . " I hate funerals , " she said , finally , " they never seem to have anything to do with the person who died . " " No , " he said , " funerals are for the living . " They passed a stoop where a handful of adolescents stood , who looked at them curiously . " Yes , " she said . And they kept walking , neither seeming to have the energy it would have demanded to stop and hail a cab . They could not talk about the funeral now ; there was too much to say ; perhaps each had too much to hide . They walked down the wide , crowded Avenue , surrounded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostling them or looking at them too directly or for too long a time . They reached the mouth of the subway at 125th Street . People climbed up from the darkness and a group of people stood on the corner , waiting for the bus . " Let 's get that cab , " she said . Vivaldo hailed a cab and they got in  --  as , she could not help feeling they had been expected to do  --  and they began to roll away from the dark , the violent scene , over which , now , a pale sun fell . " I wonder , " he said . " I wonder . " " Yes ? What do you wonder ? "  |p125Her  tone was sharper than she had intended , she could not have said why . " What she means when she says she 'll never forget it . " Something was going on in her mind , something she could not name or stop ; but it was almost as though she were her mind 's prisoner , as though the jaws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least that proves that you 're intelligent , " she said . " Much good may it do you . " She watched the cab roll down the Avenue which would eventually turn into the Avenue she knew . " I 'd like to prove to her  --  one day , " he said ; and paused . He looked out of the window . " I 'd like to make her know that the world 's not as black as she thinks it is . " " Or , " she said , dryly , after a moment , " as white . " " Or as white , " he said , mildly . She sensed that he was refusing to react to her tone . Then he said , " You do n't like her  --  Ida . " " I like her well enough . I do n't know her . " " I guess that proves my point , " he said . " You do n't know her and you do n't want to know her . " " It does n't matter whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The point is , you like her . Well , that 's fine . I do n't know why you want me to object . I do n't object . But what differencewould it make if I did ? " " None , " he said , promptly . Then , " Well , some . I 'd worry about my judgment . " " Judgment , " she said . " has nothing to do with love . " He looked at her sharply , but with gratitude , too . " For it 's love we 're talking about  --  ? " " For what you seem to be trying to prove , " she said , " It had better be . " She was silent . Then she said , " Of course , she may also have something to prove . " " I think she has something to forget , " he said . " I think I can help her forget it . " She said nothing . She watched the cold trees and the cold park . She wondered how Richard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed , suddenly , that she had been away a long time , had failed very great obligations . And all she wanted in the world right now was to get home safely and find everything as she had left it  --  as she had left it so long ago , this morning . " You 're so juvenile , " she heard herself saying . She was using her most matronly tone . " You know so little "  --  she smiled  --  " about life . About women . " He smiled , too , a pale , weary smile . " All right . But I want something real to happen to me . I do . How do you find out about "  --  he grinned , mocking her  --  " life ? About women ? Do you know a lot about men ? " The great numbers above faraway Columbus Circle glowed in the gray sky and said that it was twelve twentyseven . She would get home just in time to make lunch . Then the depression she had been battling came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into fog . " Once I thought I did , " she said . " Once I thought I knew . Once I was even younger than you are now . " Again he stared at her but this time said nothing . For a moment , as the road swerved , the skyline of New York rose before them like a jagged wall . Then it was gone . She lit a cigarette and wondered why , in that moment , she had so hated the proud towers , the grasping antennae . She had never hated the city before . Why did everything seem so pale and so profitless : and why did she feel so cold , as though nothing and no one could ever warm her again ? Low in his throat Vivaldo hummed the blues they had heard at the funeral . He was thinking of Ida , dreaming of Ida , rushing ahead to what awaited him with Ida . For a moment she hated his youth , his expectations , possibilities , she hated his masculinity . She envied Ida . She listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vivaldo stood at his window and watched the morning rise . The wind blew through the empty streets with a kind of dispirited moan ; had been blowingall night long , while Vivaldo sat at his worktable , strugglingwith a chapter which was not going well . He was terribly weary  --  he had worked in the bookstore all day and then come downtown to do a moving job  --  but this was not the reason for his paralysis . He did not seem to know enough about the people in his novel . They did not seem to trust him . They were all named , more or less , all more or less destined , the pattern he wished them to describe was clear to him . But it did not seem clear to them . He could move them about but they themselves did not move . He put words in their mouths which they uttered sullenly , unconvinced . With the same agony , or greater , with which he attempted to seduce a woman , he was trying to seduce his people : he begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they refused  --  without , for all their ugly intransigence , showing the faintest desire to leave him . They were waiting for him to find the key , press the nerve , tell the truth . Then , they seemed to be complaining , they would give him all he wished for and much more than he was now willing to imagine . All night long , in an increasing rage and helplessness , he had walked from his worktable to his window and back again . Hep128made himself coffee , he smoked cigarettes , he looked at the clock  --  and the night wore on , but his chapter did n't and he kept feeling that he ought to get some sleep because today , for the first time in several weeks , he was seeing Ida . This was her Saturday off , but she was having a cup of coffee with one of her girl friends in the restaurant where she worked . He was to meet her there , and then they were to visit Richard and Cass . Richard 's novel was about to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vivaldo , to his confusion and relief , had not found it very remarkable . But he had not had the courage to say this to Richard or to admit to himself that he would never have read the novel if Richard had not written it . All the street sounds eventually ceased  --  motors , and the silky sound of tires , footfalls , curses , pieces of songs , and loud and prolonged good nights ; the last door in his building slammed , the last murmurs , rustling , and creaking ended . The night grew still around him and his apartment grew cold . He lit the oven . They swarmed , then , in the bottom of his mind , his cloud of witnesses , in an air as heavy as the oven heat , clustering , really , around the desired and unknownIda . Perhaps it was she who caused them to be so silent . He stared into the streets and thought  --  bitterly , but also with a chilling , stunned sobriety  --  that , though he had been seeing them so long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence of an event is not the same thing as knowing what it is that one has lived through . Most people had not lived  --  nor could it , for that matter , be said that they had died  --  through any of their terrible events . They had simply been stunned by the hammer . They passed their lives thereafter in a kind of limbo of denied and unexamined pain . The great question that faced him this morning was whether or not he had ever , really , been present at his life . For if he had ever been present , then he was present still , and his world would open up before him.  |p129Now  the girl who lived across the street , whose name , he knew , was Nancy , but who reminded him of Jane  --  which was certainly why he never spoke to her  --  came in from her round of the bars and the coffee houses with yet another boneless young man . They were everywhere , which explained how she met them , but why she brought them home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore their hair long wore beards ; those who wore theirs short felt free to dispense with this useful but somewhat uneasy emphasis . They read poetry or they wrote it , furiously , as though to prove that they had been cut out for more masculine pursuits . This morning 's specimen wore white trousers and a yachting cap , and a paranoiac little beard jutted out from the bottom half of his face . This beard was his most aggressive feature , his only suggestion of hardness or tension . The girl , on the other hand , was all angles , bone , muscle , jaw ; even her breasts seemed stony . They walked down the street , hand in hand , but not together . They paused before her stoop and the girl staggered . She leaned against him in an agony of loathing , belching alcohol ; his rigidity suggested that her weight was onerous ; and they climbed the short steps to the door . Here she paused and smiled at him , coquettishly raising those stony breasts as she pulled back her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay intolerable . He muttered something about the cold , pushing the girl in before him . Well , now , they would make it  --  make what ? not love , certainly  --  and should he be standing at this window twentyfourhours hence , he would see the same scene repeated with another boy . How could they endure it ? Well , he had been there . How had he endured it ? Whiskey and marijuana had helped ; he was a pretty good liar and that had helped ; and most women inspired great contempt in him and that had helped . But there was more to it than that . After all , the country , the world  --  this city  --  was full of people who got up in the morning and went to bed at night and , mainly , throughoutp130their lives , to the same bed . They did whatever it was they were supposed to do , and they raised their children . And perhaps he did n't like these people very much , but , then , he did n't , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they existed because he had been told that they did ; presumably , the faces he saw on subways and in the streets belonged to these people , who were admirable because they were numerous . His another and father and his married sister and her husband and their friends were part of this multitude , and his younger brother would belong to them soon . And what did he know about them , really , except that they were ashamed of him ? They did n't know that he was real . It seemed that they did n't , for that matter , know that they were real , but he was insufficiently simple to find this notion comforting . Iie watched a lone man come up the street , his tight black overcoat buttoned to the neck , looking back from time to time as though he hoped he were being followed . Then the garbage truck came up the street , like a gray brainlessinsect . He watched the garbage being loaded . Then there was nothing , no one . The light was growing stronger . Soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expel the morning people . Then he thought of the scene which would now be occurring between the boy and the girl in the room . The yellow electric light , self-consciously indirect , would by now have been discovered to be useless and would have been turned off . The girl would have taken off her shoes and turned on her radio or her hi-fi set and would be lying on the bed . The gray light , coming in through the monk'sclothblinds , would , with the malice of the noncommittal , be examining every surface , corner , angle , of the unloved room . The music would not be loud . They would have poured drinks by now and the girl 's drink would be on the table . The boy 's would be between his hands . He would be sitting on the bed , turned a little away from the girl , staring at the floor . His cap would have been pushed further back.  |p131And  the silence , beneath the music , would be tremendous with their fear . Presently , one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the girl , the movement would be sighing and halting  --  sighing because of need , halting because of hostility . If it were the boy , the movement would be harshly or softly brutal : he would lunge over the girl as though rape were in his mind , or he would try to arouse her lust by means of feathery kisses , meant to be burning , which he had seen in the movies . Friction and fantasy could not fail to produce a physiological heat and hardness ; and this sheathed pressure between her thighs would be the girl 's signal to moan . She would toss her head a little and hold the boy more tightly and they would begin their descent into confusion . Off would come the cap  --  as the bed sighed and the gray light stared . Then his jacket would come off . His hands would push up the sweater and unlock the brassiere . Perhaps both might wish to pause here and begin a discovery of each other , but neither would dare . She moaned and clung to darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sound of her gasps foreshadowedhis failure . Then the record on the hi-fi came to an end , or , on the radio , a commercial replaced the love song . He pulled up her skirt . Then the half-naked girl , with a small , apologetic murmur , rose from the bed , switched off the machine . Standing in the center of the room , she might mock her nakedness with a small , cruel joke . Then she would vanish into the john . The boy would finish his drink and take off everything except his undershorts . When the girl reappeared , both would be ready . Yes , he had been there : chafing and pushing and pounding , trying to awaken a frozen girl . The battle was awful becausethe girl wished to be awakened but was terrified of the unknown . Every movement that seemed to bring her closer to him , to bring them closer together , had its violent recoil , driving them farther apart . Both clung to a fantasy rather than to each other , tried to suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender the secrets of the body.  |p132The  tendrils of shame clutched at them , however they turned , all the dirty words they knew commented on all they did . These words sometimes brought on the climax  --  joylessly , with loathing , and too soon . The best that he had ever managed in bed , so far , had been the maximum of relief with the minimum of hostility . In Harlem , however , he had merely dropped his load and marked the spot with silver . It had seemed much simpler for a time . But even simple pleasure , bought and paid for , did not take long to fail  --  pleasure , as it turned out , was not simple . When , wandering about Harlem , he came across a girl he liked , he could not fail to wish that he had met her somewhere else , under different circumstances . He could not tail to disapprove of her situation and to demand of her more than any girl in such a situation could give . If he did not like her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to despise a colored girl , it increased his self-contempt . So that , by and by , however pressing may have been the load he carried uptown , he returned home with a greater one , not to be so easily discharged . For several years it had been his fancy that he belonged in those dark streets uptown precisely because the history written in the color of his skin contested his right to be there . He enjoyed this , his right to be being everywhere contested ; uptown , his alienation had been made visible and , therefore , almost bearable . It had been his fancy that danger , there , was more real , more open , than danger was downtown and that he , having chosen to run these dangers , was snatchinghis manhood from the lukewarm waters of mediocrity and testing it in the fire . He had felt more alive in Harlem , for he had moved in a blaze of rage and self-congratulation and sexual excitement , with danger , like a promise , waiting for him everywhere . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running of risks , the misadventures which had actually befallen him had been banal indeed and might have befallen him anywhere . His dangerous , overwhelming lust for life had failed to involve him in anything deeper thanp133perhaps half a dozen extremely casual acquaintanceships in about as many bars . For memories , he had one or two marijuanaparties , one or two community debauches , one or two girls whose names he had forgotten , one or two addresses which he had lost . He knew that Harlem was a battlefield and that a war was being waged there day and night  --  but of the war aims he knew nothing . And this was due not only to the silence of the warriors  --  their silence being , anyway , spectacular in that it rang so loud : it was due to the fact that one knew of battles only what one had accepted of one 's own . He was forced , little by little , against his will , to realize that in running the dangers of Harlem he had not been testing his manhood or heightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge in the outwardadventure in order to avoid the clash and tension of the adventure proceeding inexorably within . Perhaps this was why he sometimes seemed to surprise in the dark faces which watched him a hint of amused and not entirely unkind contempt . He must be poor indeed , they seemed to say , to have been driven here . They knew that he was driven , in flight : the liberal , even revolutionary sentiments of which he was so proud meant nothing to them whatever . He was just a poor white boy in trouble and it was not in the least original of him to come running to the niggers . This sentiment had sometimes seemed to stare out at him from the eyes of Rufus . He had refused to see it , for he had insisted that he and Rufus were equals . They were friends , far beyond the reach of anything so banal and corny as color . They had slept together , got drunk together , balled chicks together , cursed each other out , and loaned each other money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had each kept hidden in his heart from the other ! It had all been a game , a game in which Rufus had lost his life . All of the pressures that each had denied had gathered together and killed him . Why had it been necessary to deny anything ? What had been the point of the game ? He turned into the room again and lit a cigarette and walked up and down . Well , perhaps theyp134had been afraid that if they looked too closely into one anothereach would have found he looked out of the window , feeling damp and frightened . Each would have found the abyss . Somewhere in his heart the black boy hated the white boy because he was white . Somewhere in his heart Vivaldo had feared and hated Rufus because he was black . They had balled chicks together , once or twice the same chick  --  why ? And what had it done to them ? And then they never saw the girl again . And they never really talked about it . Once , while he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , and on leave , in Munich . They were in a cellar someplace , it was very late at night , there were candles on the tables . There was one girl sitting near them . Who had dared whom ? Laughing , they had opened their trousers and shown themselves to the girl . To the girl , but also to each other . The girl had calmly moved away , saying that she did not understand Americans . But perhaps she had understood them well enough . She had understood that their by-play had had very little to do with her . But neither could it be said that they had been trying to attract each other  --  they would never , certainly , have dreamed of doing it that way . Perhaps they had merely been trying to set their minds at ease ; at ease as to which of them was the better man . And what had the black boy thought then ? But the question was , What had he thought ? He had thought , Hell , I 'm doing all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awareness that his colored buddy was doing possibly a little better than that , but , indeed , in the main , he had been relieved . It was out in the open , practically on the goddamn table , and it was just like his , there was nothing frightening about it . Ile smiled  --  I bet mine 's bigger than yours is  --  but rememberedoccasional nightmares in which this same vanished buddy pursued him through impenetrable forests , came at him with a knife on the edge of precipices , threatened to hurl him down steep stairs to the sea . In each of the nightmareshe wanted revenge . Revenge for what ?  |p135He  sat down again at his worktable . The page on the typewriter stared up at him , full of hieroglyphics . He read it over . It meant nothing whatever . Nothing was happening on that page . He walked back to the window . It was daylightnow , and there were people on the streets , the expected , daytime people . The tall girl , with the bobbed hair and spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street . The grocery store was open . The old Rumanian who ran it carried in the case of milk which had been deposited on the sidewalk . He thought again that he had better get some sleep . He was seeing Ida today , they were having lunch with Richard and Cass . It was eight o'clock . He stretched out on the bed and stared up at the cracks in the ceiling . He thought of Ida . He had seen her for the first time about seven years ago . She had been about fourteen . It was a holiday of some kind and Rufus had promised to take her out . And perhaps the reason he had asked Vivaldo to come with him was because Vivaldo had had to loan him the money . Because I ca n't disappoint my sister , man . It had been a day rather like today , bright , cold , and hard . Rufus had been unusually silent and he , too , had been uncomfortable . He felt that he was forcing himself in where he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accepted ; neither of them could get out of it now . They had reached the house around one o'clock in the afternoon . Mrs. Scott had opened the door . She was dressed as though she , too , were going out , in a dark gray dress a little too short for her . Her hair was short but had lately been treated with the curling iron . She kissed Rufus lightly on the cheek . " Hey , there , " she said , " how 's my bad boy ? " " Hey , yourself , " said Rufus , grinning . There was an expression on his face which Vivaldo had never seen before . It was a kind of teasing flush of amusement and pleasure ; as though his mother , standing there in her high heels , herp136gray dress , and with her hair all curled , had just done somethingextraordinarily winning . And this flush was repeated in his mother 's darker face as she smiled  --  gravely  --  back at him . She seemed to take him in from top to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the world . " This here 's a friend of mine , " Rufus said , " Vivaldo . " " How do you do ? " She gave him her hand , briefly . The brevity was not due to discourtesy or coldness , simply to lack of habit . Insofar as she saw him at all , she saw him as Rufus ' friend , one of the inhabitants of the world in which her son had chosen to live . " Sit down , do . Ida 'll be right out . " " She ready ? " " Lord , she been getting ready for days . Done drove me nearly wild . " They sat down . Vivaldo sat near the window which looked out on a dirty back yard and the back fire escape of other buildings . Across the way , a dark man sat in front of his half-open window , staring out . In spite of the cold , he wore nothing but an undershirt . There was nothing in the yard except cans , bottles , papers , filth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened and you had n't showed up , I hate to think of the weeping and wailing that would have gone on in this house . " She paused and looked toward the door which led to the rest of the apartment . " Maybe you boys like a little beer while you waiting ? " " That all you got to offer us ? " Rufus asked , with a smile . " Where 's Bert ? " " Bert 's down to the store and he ai n't back yet . You know how your father is . He going to be sorry he missed you . " She turned to Vivaldo . " Would you like a glass of beer , son ? I 'm sorry we ai n't got nothing else " Oh , beer 's fine , " said Vivaldo , looking at Rufus , " I 'd love a glass of beer . " She rose and walked into the kitchen . " What your friend do ? He a musician ? " " Naw , " said Rufus , " he ai n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a quart bottle of beer and three glasses . She had a remarkably authoritativep137and graceful walk . " Do n't you mind my boy , " she said , " he 's just full of the devil , he ca n't help it . I been trying to knock it out of him , but I ai n't had much luck . " She smiled at Vivaldo as she poured his beer . " You look kind of shy . Do n't you be shy . You just feel as welcome here as if you was in your own house , you hear ? " And she handed him his glass . " Thank you , " said Vivaldo . He took a swallow of the beer , thinking she 'd probably be surprised to know how unwelcome he felt in his own house . And then , again , perhaps she would n't be surprised at all . " You look as though you dressed up to go out someplace , too , old lady . " " Oh , " she said , deprecatingly , " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember her girl , Vickie ? Well , she done had her baby . We going to the hospital to visit her . " " Vickie got a baby ? Already ? " " Well , the young folks do n't wait these days , you know that . " She laughed and sipped her beer . Rufus looked over at Vivaldo with a frown . " Damn , " he said . " How 's she doing ? " " Pretty well  --  under the circumstances . " Her pause suggested that the circumstances were grim . " She had a right fine boy , weighed seven pounds . " She was about to say more ; but Ida entered . She was already quite tall , nearly as tall as she was going to be . She , too , had been dealing in hot combs and curling irons , Vivaldo 's later impression that she had been in pigtailswas due to the fact that her hair had been curled tightly all over her head . The dress she wore was long and blue and full , of some rustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , looking only at her brother , with an enormous , childlike smile . He and Rufus stood up . " You see , I got here , " said Rufus , smiling , and he andp138his sister kissed each other on the cheek . Their mother stood watching them with a proud , frowning smile . " I see you did , " said Ida , moving a little away from him , and laughing . Her delight in seeing her brother was so real that Vivaldo felt a kind of anguish , thinking of his own house , his own sister . " I been wondering if you 'd make it  --  you keep so busy all the time . " She said the last with a wry , proud , grown-up exasperation , as one submitting to the penalties imposed by her brother 's power and glory . She had not looked at Vivaldo , though she was vividly aware of him . But Vivaldo would not exist until Rufus permitted it . He permitted it now , tentatively , with one hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I brought a friend of mine along , Vivaldo Moore . This is my sister , Ida . " They shook hands . Her handshake was as brief as her mother 's had been , but stronger . And she looked at Vivaldo differently , as though he were a glamorous stranger , glamorousnot only in himself and his color but in his scarcely to-be-imagined relation to her brother . " Well , now , where , " asked Rufus , teasingly , " do you think you 'd like to go , young lady ? " And he watched her , grinning . But there was a constraintin the room now , too , which had not been there before , which had entered with the girl who would soon be a woman . She stood there like a target and a prize , the natural prey of someone  --  somewhere  --  who would soon be on her trail . " Oh , I do n't care , " she said . " Anywhere you-all want to go . " " But you so dressed up you sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was also dressed up , in his best dark suit and a shirt and tie he had borrowed from Vivaldo . Ida and her mother laughed . " Boy , you stop teasing your sister , " said Mrs. Scott.  | " Well , go on , get your coat , " Rufus said , " and we 'll make tracks . " " We going far ? " " We going far enough for you to have to wear a coat . " " She do n't mean is you going far , " said Mrs. Scott . " She trying to find out where you going and what time you coming back . " Ida had moved to the door by which she had entered and stood there , hesitating . " Go on , " her mother said , " get your coat and mine , too . I 'm going to walk down the block with you . " Ida left and Mrs. Scott smiled and said , " If she thought I was coming with you today , she be highly displeased . She want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty beer glasses and carried them into the kitchen . " When they were younger , " she said to Vivaldo , " Rufus just could n't do no wrong , far as Ida was concerned . " She ran water to rinse out the glasses . " She always been real afraid of the dark , you know ? but , shucks , honey , many 's the time Ida used to crawl out of her bed , middle of the night , and go running through this dark house to get in bed with Rufus . Look like she just felt safe with him . I do n't know why , Rufus sure did n't pay her much mind . " " That 's not true , " said Rufus , " I was always real sweet to my little sister . " She put the glasses down to drain and dried her hands . She peered into a hand mirror and patted her hair and then carefully put on her hat . " You used to tease her something awful , " she said . Ida returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's coat over her arm . " Ah ! " cried Rufus , " she 's glamorous ! " " She 's beautiful , " said Vivaldo . " Now , if you-all going to make fun of me , " said Ida , " I ai n't going to come with you nowhere . " Mrs. Scott put on her coat and looked critically at herp140bareheaded daughter . " If she do n't stop being so glamorous , she going to end up with the flu . " She pulled Ida 's collar up higher and buttoned it . " Ca n't get nobody in this family to wear a hat , " she said , " and then they wonder why they always full of cold . " Ida made an impatient gesture . " She afraid a hat going to mess up her hair . But she ai n't afraid of the wind doing nothing to it . " They laughed , Ida a little unwillingly , as though she were embarrassed that the joke was being shared with Vivaldo . They walked down the wintry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was otherwise nearly empty . A couple of boys were standing on a nearby stoop and they greeted Ida and Rufus and Mrs. Scott and looked with interest at Vivaldo ; looked at him as though he were a member of an enemy gang , which , indeed , he had been , not very long before . An elderly woman slowly climbed the brownstone steps of a run-down building . A black sign jutted out from the building , saying , in white letters , MOUNT OLIVEAPOSTOLIC FAITH CHURCH . " I do n't know where your father done got to , " said Mrs. Scott . " He right around the corner , in Jimmy 's Bar , " said Ida , shortly . " I doubt if he be home by the time I get back . " " Because I know you ai n't intending to be home before four in the morning , " said Mrs. Scott , smiling . " Well , he ai n't going to be home by then , " said Ida , " and you know it well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrow-hipped , swift , and rough-looking . She , too , was bareheaded , with short , dirty , broken-off hair . She wore a man 's suede jacket , too large for her , and she held it at the neck with her hand . Vivaldo watched Ida watching the girl approach . " IIere come Willa Mae , " said Mrs. Scott , " Poor little thing . " Then the girl stood before them , and she smiled . When she smiled her face was very different . She was very young.  | " How you-all today ? " she asked . " Rufus , I ai n't seen you for the longest time . " " Just fine , " Rufus said . " How you making it ? " He held his head very high and his eyes were expressionless . Ida looked down at the ground and held on to her mother . " Oh "  --  she laughed  --  " I ca n't complain . Would n't do no good nohow . " " You still at the same place ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " There was a pause . The girl looked at Vivaldo , looked away . " Well , I got to be going , " she said . " Nice running into you . " She was no longer smiling . " Nice seeing you , " said Rufus . After the girl had gone , Ida , said disapprovingly , " She used to be your girl friend , too . " Rufus ignored this . He said to Vivaldo , " She used to be a nice girl . Some cat turned her on , and then he split . " He spat on the sidewalk . " Man , what a scene . " Mrs. Scott halted before steps leading up into a tenement . Ida took Rufus by the arm . " I got to leave you children here , " said Mrs. Scott . She looked at Rufus . " What time you going to bring this girl home ? " " Oh , I do n't know . It wo n't be late . I know she want to go out night-clubbing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Scott smiled and held out her hand to Vivaldo . " Nice meeting you , son , " she said . " You make Rufusbring you by again , you hear ? Do n't you be a stranger . " " No ma'am . Thank you , I 'll come up again real soon . " But he never did see her again , not until Rufus wasdead . Rufus had never invited him home again . " I 'll be seeing you later , young lady , " she said . She started up the steps . " You children have a good time . " She had been fourteen or fifteen that day . She would be twenty-one or twenty-two now . She had told him that she remembered that day ; but he wondered how she remembered it . He had not seen her again until she had become a womanp142and at that time he had not remembered their first meeting . But he remembered it now . He remembered delight and discomfort . What did she remember ? He thought , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some sleep . But the people in his novel massed against him . They seemed to watch him with a kind of despairing , beseeching reproach . His typewriter , a dark shapeless presence , accused him , reminding him of the days and nights , the weeks , the months , the years by now , that he had spent without sleep , pursuing easier and less honorable seductions . Then he turned on his belly and his sex accused him , his sex immediately filled with blood . He turned on his back with a furious sigh . He thought , I 'm twenty-eight years old . I 'm too old for this bit . He closed his eyes and he groaned . He thought , I 've got to finish that damn novel , and he thought , Oh , God , make her love me , oh God , let me love . " What a wonderful day ! " cried Ida . He watched her face for a moment , looking extremely pleased himself , and then delicately increased his pressure on her elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry them across the broad , impatient , startling Avenue . " Yes , " he said , " it 's a great day . " They had just come up from the subway and it was perhaps this ascent from darkness to day which made the streets so dazzling . They were on Broadway at Seventy-second Street , walking uptown  --  for Cass and Richard had moved , they were climbing that well-known ladder , Cass said . The light seemed to fall with an increased hardness , examining and inciting the city with an unsparing violence , like the violence of love , and striking from the city 's grays and blacks a splendor as of steel on steel . In the windows of tall buildings flame wavered , alive , in ice . There was a high , driving wind which brightened the eyes and the faces of the people and forced their lips slightly apart , so that they all seemed to be carrying , to some immense encounter , the bright , fragile bubble of a lifetime of expec/tation . Bright boys in windbreakers , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the light , looked into polished delicatessen windows , the windows of shops , paused at the entrances of movie theatres to look at the gleaming stills ; and their voices , which shared the harsh quality of the light which covered them , seemed breaking on the air like glass splinters . Children , in great gangs and clouds , erupted out of side streets with the sound of roller skates and came roaring down on their elders like vengeance long prepared , or the arrow released from the bow . " I 've never seen such a day , " he said to Ida , and it was true . Everything seemed to be swollen , thrusting and shiftingand changing , about to burst into music or into flame or revelation . Ida said nothing . He felt , rather then saw her smile , and he was delighted all over again by her beauty . It was as though she were wearing it especially for him . She was more friendly with him today than she had ever been . He did not feel today , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evading him , locking herself away from him , forcing him to remain a stranger in her life . Today she was gayer and more natural , as though she had at last decided to come out of mourning . There was in her aspect the flavor of something won , the atmosphere of hard decisions past . She had come up from the valley . She moved with a wonderful , long-legged stride and she carried her head high , as though it had borne , but only yesterday , the weight of an African water jar . Her mother 's head had borne the weight of white folk 's washing , and it was because Ida had never known what to make of this fact  --  should she be ashamed of it , or proud ?  --  that there mingled in her regal beauty something of the too-quick , diffident , plebeian disdain . She was working now as a waitress in a chain restaurant on the eastern edge of the Village and her confusion revealed itself in her attitude toward her customers , an attitude which was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she crossed the floor in her checkered apron , her face a dark mask behind which belligerence battled with humility . This was in her eyes which never for an instant lost their wariness and which were always ready , within a split second , to turn black and lightless with contempt . Even when she was being friendly there was something in her manner , in her voice , which carried a warning ; she was always waiting for the veiled insult or the lewd suggestion . And she had good reason for it , she was not being fantastical or perverse . It was the way the world treated girls with bad reputations and every colored girl had been born with one . Now , as she walked beside him , trim and oddly elegant in a heavy , dark blue coat , and with her head covered by an old-fashioned and rather theatrical shawl , he saw that both her vanity and her contempt were being swollen by the glances which rested on her as briefly and unforgettably as the touch of a whip . She was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proud to be with her , artlessly proud , in the shining , overt , male way ; but the eyes they passed accused him , enviously , of a sniggering , back-alley conquest . White men looked at her , then looked at him . They looked at her as though she were no better , though more lascivious and rare , than a whore . And then the eyes of the men sought his , inviting a wet complicity . The women , too . They saw Ida first and might have been happy to admire her if she had been walking alone . But she was with Vivaldo , which gave her the status of a thief . The means that she had used to accomplish this abduction were beneath or perhaps beyond them , but their eyes briefly accused Vivaldo of betrayal , then narrowed against a dream or a nightmare , and turned away . Ida strode past , seeming not to see them . She conveyed with this stride and her bright , noncommittal face how far she felt them to be beneath her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however she might bear this distinction , or however others might wish to deny it ; whereas , herp145smile suggested , these people , the citizens of the world 's most bewildered city , were so common that they were all but invisible . Nothing was simpler for her than to ignore , or to seem to ignore , these people : nothing was farther beyond them than the possibility of ignoring her . And the disadvantageat which they thus were placed , for which , after all , they had only themselves to blame , said something which Vivaldo could scarcely believe concerning the poverty of their lives . So their passage raised small clouds of male and female hostility which blew into their faces like dust . And Ida accepted this spiteful tribute with a spiteful pride . " What are you humming ? " he asked . She had been humming to herself for a block or so . She continued humming for another second , coming to the end of a phrase . Then she said , smiling . " You would n't know it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this morningand it 's been with me all day . " " What is it ? " he asked . " Wo n't you sing it for me ? " " You not about to get religion , are you ? " She looked at him sideways , grinning . " I used to have religion , did you know that ? A long time ago , when I was a little girl . " " No , " he said , " there 's a whole lot about you I do n't know . Sing your song . " She bent her head toward him , leaning more heavily on his arm , as though they were two children . The colors of the shawl flashed . She sang , in her low , slightly rough voice , whispering the words to him : I woke up this morning with my mindStayed on Jesus . I woke up this morning with my mindStayed on Jesus . " That 's a great way to wake up , " he said . And she continued :  |p146I  stayed all day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's a great song , " he said . " That 's tremendous . You 've got a wonderful voice , you know that ? " " I just woke up with it  --  and it made me feel , I do n't know  --  different than I 've felt for months . It was just as though a burden had been taken off me . " " You still do have religion , " he said . " You know , I think I do ? It 's funny , I have n't thought of church or any of that type stuff for years . But it 's still there , I guess . " She smiled and sighed . " Nothing ever goes away . " And then she smiled again , looking into his eyes . This shy , confiding smile made his heart move up until it hung like a Ferris wheel at its zenith , looking down at the fair . " It seems to go away , " she said in a wondering tone , " but it does n't , it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her face , framed by the brilliant shawl . " I guess it 's true , what they used to tell me  --  if you can get through the worst , you 'll see the best . " They turned off the Avenue , toward Cass ' house . " What a beautiful girl you are , " he said . She turned from him , irrepressibly humming her song . " You are , you know . " " Well , " she said , and turned toward him again , " I do n't know if I 'm beautiful or not . But I know you 're crazy . " " I 'm crazy about you . I hope you know that . " He said it lightly and did not know if he should curse himself for his cowardice or congratulate himself on his restraint . " I do n't know what I 'd have done without you , " she said , " these last few months . I know I did n't see much of you , but I knew you were there , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I 'll ever be able to tell you . " " I had the feeling sometimes , " he said , " that you thought I was just being a pest . " And now he did curse himself forp147not saying more precisely what he felt and for sounding so much like a child . But this was his day , apparently  --  he seemed to be coming to the end of the tunnel in which he had been traveling so long . " A pest ! " she cried , and laughed . " If you are n't the cutest thing . " Then , soberly , " I was the one who was the pest  --  but I just could n't help it . " They turned into a gray , anonymous building which had two functionless pillars on either side of the door and an immense plain of imitation marble and leather beyond it . And he suddenly remembered  --  it had gone entirely out of his mind  --  that this lunch was for the purpose of celebrating the publication of Richard 's first novel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a celebration and I forgot to bring any-thing . " The elevator man rose from his chair , looking at them dubiously , and Vivaldo gave him the floor number and then , as the man still seemed to hesitate , the number of the apartment . He closed the door and the elevator began to move upward . " What are we celebrating ? " Ida asked . " You and me . We finally have a real date together . You did n't call to break it at the last minute and you have n't said you 've got to rush right home after just one drink . " He grinned at Ida , but he was aware that he was speaking partly for the benefit of the elevator man , whom he had never noticed before . But he disliked him intensely now . " No , come on , now , what are we really celebrating ? Or maybe I should say what are Richard and Cass celebrat-ing ? " " Richard 's novel . It 's published . It 'll be in all the bookstores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " that 's wonderful . He must feel wonderful . A real , honest-to-God published writer . " " Yes , " he said , " one of our boys made it . " He was touched by her enthusiasm . And he was aware , at the samep148time , that she had also been speaking for the benefit of the elevator man . " It must be wonderful for Cass , too , " she said . " And for you , he 's your friend . " She looked at him . " When are you going to bring out your novel ? " This question , and even more her way of asking it , seemed to contain implications he scarcely dared to trust . " One of these days , " he muttered ; and he blushed . The elevator stopped and they walked into a corridor . Richard 's door was to the left of them . " It looks like I 've got my hands full right now . " " What do you mean ? It 's not working the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " " Yes . " Then , as they faced each other before the door , " What did you think I meant ? " " Oh , that 's what I thought you meant , all right . " He thought , Now listen , do n't spoil it , do n't rush it , you stupid bastard , do n't spoil it . " It 's just that it 's not exactly what I meant . " " What did you mean ? " She was smiling . " I meant  --  I hoped I 'm going to have my hands full now , with you . " She called part of her smile back , but she still looked amused . She watched him . " You know  --  dinners and lunches and  --  walks  --  and movies and things  --  with you . With you . " He dropped his eyes . " You know what I mean ? " Then , in the warm , electrical silence , he raised his eyes to hers , and he said , " You know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " let 's talk about it after lunch , okay ? " She turned from him and faced the door . He did not move . She looked at him with her eyes very wide . " Are n't you going to ring the bell ? " " Sure . " They watched each other . Ida reached out and touched him on the cheek . He grabbed her hand and held it for a moment against his face . Very gently , she pulled her hand away . " You are the cutest thing I 've ever seen , " she said , " you are . Go on and ring that bell , I 'm hungry . "  |p149He  laughed and pressed the button . They heard the sour buzzing inside the apartment , then confusion , a slammed door , and footsteps . He took one of Ida 's hands in both of his . " I want to be with you , " he said . " I want you to be with me . I want that more than I 've ever wanted anything in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them , dressed in a rusty orange frock , her hair pulled back and falling around her shoulders . She held a cigarette in one hand , with which she made a gesture of exaggerated welcome . " Come in , children , " she said , " I 'm delighted to see you , but there 's absolute chaos in this house today . Everything'sgone wrong . " She closed the door behind them . They heard a child screaming somewhere in the apartment , and Richard 's voice raised in anger . Cass listened for a moment , her forehead wrinkled with worry . " That 's Michael , " she said , helplessly , " He 's been impossible all day  --  fighting with his brother , with his father , with me . Richard finally gave him a spanking and I guess he 's going to leave him in his room . " Michael 's screams diminished and they heard the voices of Michael and his father working out , apparently , the terms of a truce . Cass lifted her head . " Well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take off your things , I 'll show you into the living room and give you things to drink and to nibble on  --  you 'll need them , lunch is going to be late , of course . Ida , how are you ? I have n't seen you in God knows when . " She took Ida 's coat and shawl . " Do you mind if I do n't hang them up ? I 'll just dump them in the bedroom , other people are coming over after lunch . " They followed her into the large bedroom . Ida immediately walked over to the large , full-length mirror and worriedly patted her hair and applied new lipstick . " I 'm just fine , Cass , " she said , " but you 're the one  --  ! You got a famous husband all of a sudden . How does it feel ? " " He 's not even famous yet , " said Cass , " and , already Ica n't stand it . Somehow , it just seems to reduce itself tohaving drinks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to if they were n't "  --  she coughed  --  " in the profession . God , what a profession . I had no idea . " Then she laughed . They started toward the living room . " Try to persuade Vivaldo to become a plumber . " " No , dear , " said Ida , " I would n't trust Vivaldo with no tools whatever . This boy is just as clumsy as they come . I 'm always expecting him to fall over those front feet he 's got . Never saw anybody with so many front feet . " The living room was down two steps and the wide windows opened on a view of the river . Ida seemed checked , but only for an instant by the view of the river . She walked into the center of the room . " This is wonderful . You people have really got some space . " " We were really very lucky , " Cass said . " The people who had it had been here for years and years and they finally decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember . Anyway , since they 'd been here so long the rent had n't gone up much , you know ? So it 's really a lot cheaper than most things like this in the city . " She looked over at Ida . " You know , you look wonderful , you really do . I 'm so glad to see you . " " I 'm glad to see you , " said Ida , " and I feel fine , I feel better than I 've felt , oh , in years . " She crossed to the bar , and stood facing Cass . " Look like you people done got serious about your drinking , too , " she said , in a raucous , whiskey voice . " Let me have a taste of that there Cutty Sark . " Cass laughed , " I thought you were a bourbon woman . " She dropped some ice in a glass . " ' When it comes to liquor , " Ida said , " I 's anybody 's woman . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me have some water in that , sugar , I do n't want to get carried away here this afternoon . " She looked toward Vivaldo , who stood on the steps , watching her . She leaned toward Cass . " Honey , who 's that funny-looking number standing in the do'way ? " " Oh , he drops by from time to time . He always looks that way . He 's harmless . "  | " I 'll have the same thing the lady 's drinking , " said Vivaldo , and joined them at the bar . " Well , I 'm glad you told me he 's harmless , " Ida said , and winked at him , and drummed her long fingernails on the bar . " I 'll have a short drink with you , " said Cass , " and then I 'm simply going to have to vanish . I 've got to finish fixing lunch  --  and we have to eat it  --  and I 'm not even dressed yet . " " Well , I 'll help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time are all these other people coming over ? " " About five , I guess . There 's this TV producer coming , he 's supposed to be very bright and liberal  --  Steve Ellis , does that sound right ?  --  " " Oh , yes , " said Ida , " he 's supposed to be very good , that man . He 's very well known . " She mentioned a show of his she had seen some months ago , which utilized Negroes , and which had won a great many awards . " Wow . " She wiggled her shoulders . " Who else is coming ? " " Well . Ellis . And Richard 's editor . And some other writer whose name I ca n't remember . And I guess they 're bringing their wives . " She sipped her drink , looking rather weary . " I ca n't imagine why we 're doing this . I guess it 's mainly on account of the TV man . But Richard 's publishers are giving Richard a small party Monday  --  in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people then . " " Buck up , old girl , " said Vivaldo . " You 're just going to have to get used to it . " " I expect so . " She gave them a quick , mischievous grin , and whispered , " But they seem so silly  --  1 those I 've met . And they 're so serious , they just shine with it . " Vivaldo laughed . " That 's treason , Cass . Be careful . " " I know . They really are getting behind the book , though ; they have great hopes for it . You have n't seen it yet , have you ? " She walked over to the sofa , where books and papers were scattered and picked the book up , thoughtfully . She crossed the room again . " Here it is . " She put the book down on the bar between Ida andp152Vivaldo . " It 's had great advance notices . You know , literate , ' adult , ' thrilling '  --  that sort of thing . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to Crime and Punishment  --  because they both have such a simple story line , I guess . " Vivaldo looked at her sharply . " Well . I 'm only quoting . " The sun broke free of a passing cloud and filled the room . They squinted down at the book on the bar . Cass stood quietly behind them . The book jacket was very simple , jagged red letters on a dark blue ground : The Strangled Men . A novel of murder , by Richard Silenski . He looked at the jacket flap which described the story and then turned the book over to find himself looking into Richard 's open , good-natured face . The paragraph beneath the picture summed up Richard 's life , from his birth to the present : Mr. Silenski is married and is the father of two sons , Paul ( rr ) and Michael ( 8 ) . He makes his home in New York City . He put the book down . Ida picked it up . " It 's wonderful , " he said to Cass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face between his hands and kissed her on the forehead . He picked up his drink . " There 's always something wonderful about a book , you know ?  --  when it 's really , all of a sudden , a book , and it 's there between covers . And there 's your name on it . It must be a great feeling . " " Yes , " said Cass . " You 'll know that feeling soon , " said Ida . She was examiningthe book intently . She looked up with a grin . " I bet I just found out something you never knew , " she said to Vivaldo . " Impossible , " said Vivaldo . " I 'm sure I know everything Richard knows . " " I would n't be so sure , " said Cass . " I bet you do n't know Cass 's real name . " Cass laughed . " He does , but he 's forgotten it . " He looked at her . " That 's true , I have . What is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why nobody ever uses it . "  | " Richard just did , " she said . " I think he did it just to tease me . " Ida showed him the book 's dedication page , which read for Clarissa , my wife . " That 's cute , is n't it ? " She looked at Cass . " You sure had me fooled , baby ; you just do n't seem to be the Clarissa type . " " As it turned out , " said Cass , with a smile . Then she looked at Vivaldo . " Ah , " she said , " did you happen to note a very small note in today 's theatrical section ? " She went to the sofa and picked up one of the newspapers and returned to Vivaldo . " Look . Eric 's coming home . " " Who 's Eric ? " Ida asked . " Eric Jones , " Cass said . " He 's an actor friend of ours who 's been living in France for the last couple of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Broadway this fall . " Vivaldo read . Lee Bronson has signed Eric Jones , who last appeared locally three seasons ago in the short-lived Kingdom of the Blind , for the role of the elder son in the Lane Smith drama , Happy Hunting Ground , which opens here in November . " Son of a bitch , " said Vivaldo , looking very pleased . He turned to Cass . " Have you heard from him ? " " Oh , no , " said Cass , " not for a very long time . " " It 'll be nice to see him again , " Vivaldo said . He looked at Ida . " You 'll like him . Rufus knew him , we were all very good friends . " He folded the paper and dropped it on the bar . " Everybody 's famous , goddamnit , except me . " Richard came into the room , looking harried and boyish , wearing an old gray sweater over a white T-shirt and carrying his belt in his hands . " It 's easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling . " We heard it all the way in here . " Richard looked at the belt shamefacedly and threw it on the sofa . " I did n't really use it on him . I just made believe I was going to . I probably should have whaled the daylights out of him . " He said to Cass , " What 's the matter with him all of a sudden ? He 's never acted like this before . "  | " I 've already told you what I think it is . It 's the new house and kind of new excitement , and he does n't see as much of you as he 's used to , and he 's reacted to all of this very badly . He 'll get over it , but it 's going to take a little time . " " Paul 's not like that . Hell , he 's gone out and made friends already . He 's having a ball . " " Richard , Paul and Michael are not at all alike . " He stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Sorry . " He turned to Ida and Vivaldo . " Excuse us . We 're fascinated by our offspring . We sometimes sit around and talk about them for hours . Ida , you look wonderful , it 's great to see you . " He took her hand in his , looking into her eyes . " Are you all right ? " " I 'm fine , Richard . And it 's wonderful to see you . Especially now that you 're such a success . " " Ah , you must n't listen to my wife , " he said . He went behind the bar . " Everybody 's got a drink except me , I guess . And I "  --  he looked very boyish , very secure and happy  --  " am going to have a dry martini on the rocks . " He opened the ice bucket . " Only , there are n't any rocks . " " I 'll get you some ice , " Cass said . She put her drink on the bar and picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have to buy some ice from the delicatessen . " " Well , I 'll go down and do that later , chicken . " He pinched her cheek . " Do n't worry . " Cass left the room . Richard grinned at Vivaldo . " If you had n't got here today , I swore I was just going to cut you out of my heart forever . " " You knew I 'd be here . " He raised his glass . " Congratulations . " Then , " What 's this I hear about all the TV networksjust crying for you ? " " Do n't exaggerate . There 's just one producer who 's got some project he wants to talk to me about , I do n't even know what it is . But my agent thinks I should see him . " Vivaldo laughed . " Do n't sound so defensive . I like TV . " " You 're a liar . You have n't even got a TV set . "  | " Well , that 's just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success like you , I 'll go out and buy me the biggest screen on the market . " He watched Richard 's face and laughed again . " I 'm just teasing you . " " Yeah . Ida , see what you can do to civilize this character . He 's a barbarian . " I know , " Ida said , sadly , " but I hardly know what to do about it . Of course , " she added , " if you were to offer me an autographed copy of your book , I might come up with an inspiration . " " It 's a deal , " Richard said . Cass came back with the ice bucket and Richard took it from her and set it on the bar . He mixed his drink . Then he joined them on the other side of the bar and put his arm around Cass ' shoulders . " To the best Saturday we 've ever had , " he said , and raised his glass . " May there be many more . " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all , " he said . " We love you , too , " said Vivaldo . Cass kissed Richard on the cheek . " Before I go and try to salvage lunch  --  tell me , just what kind of arrangement did you make with Michael ? Just so I 'll know . " " He 's taking a nap . I promised to wake him in time for cocktails . We have to buy him some ginger ale . " " And Paul ? " " Oh , Paul . He 'll tear himself away from his cronies in time to come upstairs and get washed and meet the people . Wild horses would n't keep him away . " He turned to Vivaldo . " He 's been bragging about me all over the house . " Cass watched him for a moment . " Very well managed . And now I leave you . " Ida picked up her glass . " Wait a minute . I 'm coming with you . " " You do n't have to , Ida . I can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we keep them waiting too long . I 'll help you , we can get it done in no time . " She followed Cass to the doorway . With one foot on the step ,  |p156she  turned . " Now , I 'm going to hold you to your promise , Richard . About that book , I mean . " " I 'm going to hold you to yours . You 're the one who got the dirty end of this deal . " She looked at Vivaldo . " Oh , I do n't know . I might think of something . " " I hope you know what you 're getting into , " Cass said . " I do n't like that look on Vivaldo 's face at all . " Ida laughed . " 1-Ie is kind of simple-looking , I declare . Come on . I 'll tell you about it in the kitchen . " " Do n't believe a word Cass says about me , " Vivaldo called . " Oh , you mean she knows something about you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get down to the knitty-gritty this afternoon . " And they disappeared . " You 've always had a thing about colored girls , have n't you ? " Richard asked , after a moment . There was something curiously wistful in his voice . Vivaldo looked at him . " No . I 've never been involved with a colored girl . " " No . But you used to do a lot of tomcatting up in Harlem . And it 's so logical , somehow , that you should be trying to make it with a colored girl now  --  you certainly scraped the bottom of the white barrel . " Against his will , Vivaldo was forced to laugh . " Well . I do n't think Ida 's color has a damn thing to do with it , one way or the other . " " Are you sure ? Is n't she just another in your long line of waifs and strays and unfortunates ? " " Richard , " Vivaldo said , and he put his glass down on the bar , " are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course I 'm not trying to bug you , " Richard said . " I just think that maybe it 's time you straightened out  --  settled down  --  time you figured out what you want to do and started doing it instead of bouncing around like a kid . You 're not a kid . " " Well , I think it 's time you stopped treating me likep157one . I know what I want to do and I am doing it . All right ? And I 've got to do it my own way . So get off my back . " He smiled , but it was too late . " I did n't think I was on your back , " said Richard . " I 'm sorry . " " I did n't mean it the way it sounded , you know that . " " Let 's just forget it , okay ? " " Well , hell , I do n't want you mad at me . " " I 'm not mad at you . " He walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Vivaldo , he said , " You did n't really like my book much , did you ? " " So that 's it . " " What ? " Richard turned , the sunlight full on his face , revealing the lines in his forehead , around and under his eyes , and around his mouth and chin . The face was full of lines ; it was a tough face , a good face , and Vivaldo had loved it for a long time . Yet , the face lacked , something , he could not have said what the something was , and he knew his helplessjudgment was unjust . He felt tears spring to his eyes . " Richard , we talked about the book and I told you what I thought , I told you that it was a brilliant idea and wonderfully organized and beautifullywritten and  --  " He stopped . He had not liked the book . He could not take it seriously . It was an able , intelligent , mildly perceptive tour de force and it would never mean anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which books lived , whether they were great , mangled , mutilated , or mad , Richard 's book did not exist . There was nothing he could do about it . " And you yourself said that the next book would be better . " " What are you crying about ? " " What ? " He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand . " Nothing . " He walked over to the bar and leaned on it . Some deep and curious cunning made him add , " You talk as though you did n't want us to be friends any more . " " Oh , crap . Is that what you think ? Of course we 're friends , we 'll be friends till we die . " He walked to the barp158and put his hand on Vivaldo 's shoulder , leaning down to look into his face . " Honest . Okay ? " They shook hands . " Okay . Do n't bug me any more . " Richard laughed . " I wo n't bug you any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lunch is on the table . Come on , now , hurry , before it gets cold . " They were all a little drunk by the time lunch was over , having drunk with it two bottles of champagne ; and eventuallythey sat in the living room again as the sun began to grow fiery , preparing to go down . Paul arrived , dirty , breathless , and cheerful . His mother sent him into the bathroom to wash and change his clothes . Richard remembered the ice that had to be bought for the party and the ginger ale that he had promised Michael , and he went downstairs to buy them . Cass decided that she had better change her clothes and put up her hair . Ida and Vivaldo had the living room to themselves for a short time . Ida put on an old Billie Holiday record and she and Vivaldo danced . There was a hammer knocking in his throat as she stepped into his arms with a friendly smile , one hand in his hand , one hand resting lightly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His fingers , at her waist , seemed to have become abnormally and dangerously sensitive , and he prayed that his face did not show the enormous , illicit pleasure which entered him through his fingertips . He seemed to feel , beneath the heavy fabric of the suit she wore , the texture of the cloth of her blouse , the delicate obstruction which was the fastening of her skirt , the slick material of her slip which seemed to purr and crackle under his fingers , against her smooth , warm skin . She seemed to be unaware of the libertiesbeing taken by his stiff , unmoving fingers . She moved with him , both guiding and being guided by him , effortlessly keeping her feet out of the path of his great shoes . Their bodies barely touched but her hair tickled his chin and gave off a sweet , dry odor and suggested , as did everything aboutp159this girl , a deep , slow-burning , carnal heat . He wanted to hold her closer to him . Perhaps , now , at this very moment , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower his head and wipe that smile from her face , placing his unsmiling mouth on hers . " Your hands are cold , " he said , for the hand which held his was very dry , and the fingertips were cool . " That 's supposed to mean that I 've got a warm heart , " said Ida , " but what it really means is poor circulation . " " I prefer , " he said , " to believe that you 've got a warm heart . " " I was counting on that , " she said , with a laugh , " but when you get to know me better you 'll find out that I 'm the one who 's right . I 'm afraid , " she said , with a teasing , frowningsmile , " that I 'm usually right . " She added , " About me . " " I wish I knew you better , " he said . " So , " she said , with a short , light laugh , " do I ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his exile and he and Paul were given ginger ales on the rocks . Cass appeared in a high-necked , old-fashioned , burgundycoloreddress , and with her hair up . Richard put on a sport shirt and a more respectable-looking sweater , and Ida vanishedto put on her face . The people began to arrive . The first to arrive was Richard 's editor , Loring Montgomery , a chunky , spectacled , man , with smooth , graying hair , who was younger than he looked  --  nearly ten years younger , in fact , than Richard . He had a diffident manner and a nervous giggle . With him was Richard 's agent , a darkhaired , dark-eyed young woman , who wore much silver and a little gold , and whose name was Barbara Wales . She , too , had a giggle but it was not nervous , and a great deal of manner but it was not diffident . She apparently felt that her status as Richard 's agent created a bond of intimacy between herself and Cass ; who , helplessly and miserably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' voice and the razorlike distinctness of her syllables , trotted obediently behind her into the bedroom where coats and hats were top160be deposited and where the women could repair their makeup . " The bar is over here , " Richard called , " whatever you 're drinking , come and get it . " " I could stand another drink , " Vivaldo said . " I 've been drinking all day and I ca n't get drunk . " " Are you trying to ? " asked Ida . He looked at her and smiled . " No , " he said , " no , I 'm not trying to . But if I were , I could n't make it , not today . " They stood facing the window . " You 're going to have supper with me , are n't you ? " " You 're not hungry , already ? " " No . But I 'm going to be hungry around suppertime . " " Well , " she said , " ask me around suppertime . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , or anything ? You 're not going to run out on me ? " " No , " she said , " I 'm going to stick with you until the bitter end . You 've got to talk to that agent , you know . " " Do I have to ? " He looked in the direction of the glittering Miss Wales . " Of course you do . I 'm sure it 's one of the reasons Richard wanted you here this afternoon . And you have to talk to the editor , too . " " Why ? I have n't got anything to show him . " " Well , you will . I 'm sure Richard arranged all this partly for you . Now , you 've got to cooperate . " " And what are you going to be doing while I 'm having all these conferences ? " " I 'll talk to Cass . Nobody 's really interested in us ; we do n't write . " Ile kissed her hair . " You are the cutest thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Steve Ellis , whohad come with his wife . Ellis was a short , square man withcurly hair and a boyish face . The face was just beginning , as is the way with boyish faces , not so much to harden as to congeal . He had a reputation as the champion of doomedcauses , reaction 's intrepid foe ; and he walked into the draw/ing rooms of the world as though he expected to find the enemy ambushed there . His wife wore a mink coat and a flowered hat , seemed somewhat older than he , and was inclined to be talkative . " Great meeting you , Silenski , " he said . Though he was compelled to look up to Richard , he did so with his head at an odd and belligerent angle , as though he were looking up in order more clearly to sight down . The hand he extended to Richard with a bulletlike directness suggested also the arrogant limpness of hands which have the power to make or break : only custom prevented the hand from being kissed . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chat a little later . " And his smile was good-natured , open , and boyish . When he was introduced to Ida , he stood stock-still , throwing out his arms as though he were a little boy . " You 're an actress , " he said . " You 've got to be an actress . " " No , " said Ida , " I 'm not . " " But you must be . I 've been looking for you for years . You 're sensational ! " " Thank you , Mr. Ellis , " she said , laughing , " but I am not an actress . " Her laugh was a little strained but Vivaldo could not know whether this was due to nerves or displeasure . People stood in smiling groups around them . Cass stood behind the bar , watching . Ellis smiled conspiratorially and pushed his head a little forward . " What do you do , then ? Come on , tell me . " " Well , at the moment , " Ida said , rather pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A waitress . Well , my wife 's here , so I wo n't ask you where you work . " He stepped a little closer to Ida . " But what do you think about while you walk around waiting on tables ? " Ida hesitated , and he smiled again , coaxing and tender . " Come on . You ca n't tell me that all you want is to get to be head waitress . " Ida laughed . Her lips curved rather bitterly , and shep162said , " No . " She hesitated and looked toward Vivaldo , and Ellis followed her look . " I 've sometimes thought of singing . That 's what I 'd like to do . " " Aha ! " he cried , triumphantly , " I knew I 'd get it out of you . " He pulled a card out of his breast pocket . " When you get ready to make the break , and let it be soon , you come and see me . Do n't you forget . " " You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lightly and the look with which she measured Ellis gave Vivaldo no clue as to what was going on in her mind . " Your name , " he said , " is Ida Scott . Right ? " " Right . " " Well , I never forget names or faces . Try me . " " That 's true , " said his wife , " he never forgets a name or a face . I do n't know how he does it . " " I , " said Vivaldo , " am not an actress . " Ellis looked startled , then he laughed . " You could have fooled me , " he said . He took Vivaldo by the elbow . " Come and have a drink with me . Please . " " I do n't know why I said that . I was half-kidding . " " But only half . What 's your name ? " " Vivaldo . Vivaldo Moore . " " And you 're not an actress  --  ? " " I 'm a writer . Unpublished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A novel . " " What 's it about ? " " My novel 's about Brooklyn . " " The tree ? Or the kids or the murderers or the junkies ? " Vivaldo swallowed . " All of them . " " That 's quite an assignment . And if you do n't mind my saying so , it sounds just a little bit old-fashioned . " He put his hand before his mouth and burped . " Brooklyn 's been done . And done . " No it has n't , Vivaldo thought . " You mean , " he said , with a smile , " that it does n't have any TV possibilities ? " " It might have , who knows ? " He looked at Vivaldo withp163friendly interest . " You really have a sneer in your voice when you say TV , you know that ? What are you so afraid of ? " He tapped Vivaldo on the chest . " Art does n't exist in a vacuum ; it is n't just for you and your handful of friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this **27;3589;TOOLONG ! " " I 'm sick of it , too , " said Vivaldo . " I do n't think of myself as a sensitive young man . " " No ? You sound like one and you act like one . You look down your nose at everybody . Yes , " he insisted , for Vivaldo looked at him in some surprise , " you think that most people are shit and you 'd rather die than get yourself dirtied up in any of the popular arts . " Then he gave Vivaldo a deliberate , insolent once-over . " And here you are , in your best suit , and ' I bet you live in some dingy , ice-water apartmentand you ca n't even take your girl out to a night club . " His voice dropped . " The colored girl , Miss Scott , you see I do remember names , she 's your girl , is n't she ? That 's why you got pissed off at me . Man , you 're too touchy . " " I thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have felt that if she were a white girl . " " I 'd have felt that about any girl who happened to be with me . " But he wondered if Ellis were right . And he realized that he would never know , there would never be any way for him to know . He felt that Ellis had treated Ida with a subtle lack of respect . But he had spoken to her in the only way he could , and it was the way he spoke to everyone . All of the people in Ellis ' world approached each other under cover of a manner designed to hide whatever they might really be feeling , about each other or about themselves . When confronted with Ida , who was so visibly rejected from the only world they knew , this manner was forced to become relativelypersonal , self-conscious , and tense . It became entangled with an effort to avoid being called into judgment ; with a fear that their spiritual and social promissory notes mightp164suddenly be called up . By being pressed into the service of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally false and because it was false , it was sinister . Then , as Ellis poured himself another applejack and he poured himself another Scotch , he realized that the things which Ellis had , and the things which Richard was now going to have , were things that he wanted very much . Ellis could get anything he wanted by simply lifting up a phone ; headwaiters were delighted to see him ; his signature on a bill or a check was simply not to be questioned . If he needed a suit , he bought it ; he was certainly never behind in his rent ; if he decided to fly to Istanbul tomorrow , he had only to call his travel agent . He was famous , he was powerful , and he was not really much older than Vivaldo , and he worked very hard . Also , he could get the highest-grade stuff going ; he had only to give the girl his card . And then Vivaldo realized why he hated him . He wondered what he would have to go through to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to give  --  to be powerful , to be adored , to be able to make it with any girl he wanted , to be sure of holding any girl he had . And he looked around for Ida . At the same time , it occurred to him that the question was not really what he was going to " get " but how he was to discover his possibilities and become reconciled to them . Richard , now , was talking , or , rather , listening to Mrs. Ellis ; Ida was listening to Loring ; Cass sat on the sofa , listening to Miss Wales . Paul stood near her , looking about the room ; Cass held him absently and yet rather desperately by the elbow . " Anyway  --  I 'd like to keep in touch with you , maybe you 've got something . " And Ellis handed him his card . " Whv do n't you give me a ring sometime ? and I meant what I said to Miss Scott , too . I produce pretty good shows , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't have to lower your artistic standards . "  |p165Vivaldo  looked at the card , then looked at Ellis . " Thanks , " he said . " I 'll bear it in mind . " Ellis smiled . " I like you , " he said . " I 'm even willing to suggest an analyst for you . Let 's join the party . " He walked over to Richard and Mrs. Ellis . Vivaldo walked over to Ida . " I 've been trying to find out about your novel , " Loring said , " but your young lady here is most cagey . She wo n't give me a clue . " " I keep telling him that I do n't know anything about it , " Ida said , " but he wo n't believe me . " " She does n't know much about it , " Vivaldo said . " I 'm not sure I know an awful lot about it myself . " Abruptly , he felt himself beginning to tremble with weariness . He wanted to take Ida and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was not really late ; the last rays of the setting sun were fading beyond the river . " Well , " said Loring , " as soon as you do have something , I hope you 'll get in touch with me . Richard thinks you 're tremendously talented and I 'd certainly trust his judgment . " He knew that Ida was puzzled and irritated by the mediocrity of his response . He tried to pump up enthusiasm , and watching Ida 's face helped . He could not imagine what she thought of Ellis , and rage at himself , his jealousy , his fear , and his confusion , contributed a saving intensity to his evasive reply . Loring seemed more certain than ever that he was a diamond in the rough , and Ida more certain than ever that he was in need of hands to push him . And he himself felt , in a way he had not felt before , that it was time for him to take the plunge . This was the water , the people in this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , but it was the only water there was . Miss Wales now looked over toward him , but he avoided her eyes , giving all of his attention to Ida . " Let 's go , " he said , in a low voice , " let 's get out of here . I 've had it . "  | " You want to go now ? You have n't talked to Miss Wales . " But he watched her eyes flicker toward the bar , where Ellis stood . And there was something in her face which he could not read , something speculative and hard . " I do n't want to talk to Miss Wales . " " Why on earth not ? You 're being silly . " " Look , " he said , " is there someone here you want to talk to ? " Oh , you idiot ! he groaned to himself . But the words were said . She looked at him . " I do n't know what you mean . What are you talking about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just crazy . Do n't mind me . " " You were thinking something . What were you think-ing ? " " Nothing , " he said , " really nothing . " He smiled . " I do n't care . We can stay if you want to . " " I was only staying , " she said , " on account of you . " He was about to say , Well then , we can go , but decided that it would be smarter not to . The doorbell rang . He said , " I just wanted to avoid getting involved in a supper deal with any of these people , that 's all . " " But who , " she persisted , " did you think I wanted to talk to ? " " Oh , " he said , " I thought if you were really seriousabout that singing business , you might have wanted to makean appointment with Ellis . I imagine he could be helpful . " She looked at him wearily , with mockery and pity . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy little mind you 've got . " Then her manner changed , and she said , very coldly , " Youdo n't really have the right , you know , to worry about whoI talk to . And what you 're suggesting does n't flatter meat all . " She kept her voice low , but it had begun to shake . " Maybe , now , I 'll behave like what you think I am ! " Shewalked over to the bar and stepped between Richard andEllis . She was smiling . Ellis put one hand on her elbowand his face changed as he spoke to her , becoming greedierp167and more vulnerable . Richard went behind the bar to pour Ida a drink . Vivaldo could have joined them , but he did not dare . Her outburst had come so mysteriously , and with such speed , that he was afraid to think of what might happen if he walked over to the bar . And she was right ; he was wrong . Who she talked to was none of his business . But her reaction had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . His patiently amassed and hoarded capital  --  of understanding and gallantry  --  had vanished in the twinkling of an eye . " I 'd like you to meet Sydney Ingram . This is Vivaldo Moore . " Cass was at his shoulder , presenting the newcomer , of whose arrival he had been vaguely aware . He had come alone . Vivaldo recognized his name because the boy 's first novel had just been published and he wanted to read it . He was tall , nearly as tall as Vivaldo , with a pleasant , heavy-featured face and a great deal of black hair and , like Vivaldo , was dressed in a dark suit , probably his best one . " I 'm delighted to meet you , " Vivaldo said  --  sincerely , for the first time that evening . " I 've read his novel , " Cass said , " it 's wonderful , you must read it . " " I want to , " said Vivaldo . Ingram smiled , looking uncomfortable , and stared into his glass as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated enough for the time being , " Cass said . " Let me stay with you two for a while . " She led them slowly toward the big window . It was twilight , the sun was gone , soon the street lamps would be turned on . " Somehow , I do n't think I 'm cut out to be a literary hostess . " " You looked fine to me , " said Vivaldo . " You were n't trying to keep up a conversation with me . My attention just keeps wandering , I ca n't help it . I might as well be in a room full of physicists . "  | " What are they talking about over at the bar ? " Vivaldo asked . " Steve Ellis 's responsibility to the televiewers of America , " Ingram said . They laughed . " Do n't laugh , " said Ingram , " he , too , can become President . At least , he can read and write . " " I should think , " said Cass , " that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one arm and they stood together in the darkening window , staring out at the highway and the shining water . " What a great difference there is , " she said , " between dreaming of something and dealing with it ! " Neither Vivaldo nor Ingram spoke . Cass turned to Ingramand , in a voice he had never heard her use before , wistfuland desirous , she asked , " Are you working on something new , Mr. Ingram ? I hope you are . " And his voice seemed , oddly , to respond to hers . They might have been calling each other across that breadth of water , seeking for each other as the darkness relentlessly fell . " Yes , " he said , " I am , it 's a new novel , it 's a love story . " " A love story ! " she said . Then , " And where does it take place ? " " Oh , here in the city . Now . " There was a silence . Vivaldo felt her small hand , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reading it , " she said , " very much . " " Not more , " he said , " than I am looking forward to finishing it and having it read , especially , if 1 may say so , by you . " She turned her face to Ingram , and he could not see her smile but he could feel it . " Thank you , " she said . She turned to the window again and she sighed . " 1 suppose I must get back to my physicists . " They watched the street lamps click on . " I 'm going to have a drink , " Cass said . " Will anyone join me ? " " Sure , " said Vivaldo . They walked to the bar . Richard ,  |p169Ellis  , and Loring were sitting on the sofa . Miss Wales and Mrs. Ellis were standing at the bar . Ida was not in the room . " Excuse me , " said Vivaldo . " I think somebody 's in there ! " cried Miss Wales . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was sitting in the bedroom , among all the coats and hats , perfectly still . " Ida  --  ? " Her hands were folded in her lap and she was staring at the floor . " Ida , why are you mad at me ? I did n't mean anything . " She looked up at him . Her eyes were full of tears . " Why did you have to say what you said ? Everything was fine and I was so happy until you said that . You think I 'm nothing but a whore . That 's the only reason you want to see me . " The tears dripped down her face . " All you white bastards are the same . " " Ida , I swear that is n't true . I swear that is n't true . " He dropped to one knee beside the bed and tried to take her hands in his . She turned her face away . " Honey , I 'm in love with you . I got scared and I got jealous , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't , I could n't , I love you . Ida , please believe me . I love you . " Her body kept shaking and he felt her tears on his hands . He raised her hands to his lips and kissed them . He tried to look into her face , but she kept her face turned away . " Ida . Ida , please . " " I do n't know any of these people , " she said , " I do n't care about them . They think I 'm just another colored girl , and they trying to be nice , but they do n't care . They do n't want to talk to me . I only stayed because you asked me , and you 've been so nice , and I was so proud of you , and now you 've spoiled it all . " " Ida , " he said , " if I 've spoiled things between you and me , I do n't know how I 'm going to live . You ca n't say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to forgive me and give me another chance . Ida . " He put one hand to her face andp170slowly turned it toward him . " Ida , I love you , I do , more than anything in this world . You 've got to believe me . I 'd rather die than hurt you . " She was silent . " I was jealous and I was scared and that was a very dumb thing I said . But I was just afraid you did n't care about me . That 's all . I did n't mean anything bad about you . " She sighed and reached for her purse . He gave her a handkerchief . She dried her eyes and blew her nose . She looked very tired and helpless . He moved and sat beside her on the bed . She avoided looking at him but she did not move . " Ida  --  " and he was shocked by the sound of his voice , it contained such misery . It did not seem to be his voice , it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I love you . Do you care about me ? " She rose and walked to the mirror . He watched her . " Please tell me . " She looked into the mirror , then picked up her handbagfrom the bed . She opened it , closed it , then looked in the mirror again . Then she looked at him , " Yes , " she said , helplessly , " yes , I do . " He took her face between his hands and kissed her . At first she did not answer him , seemed merely to be enduring him , seemed suspended , hanging , waiting . She was trembling and he tried to control her trembling with the force of his arms and hands . Then something seemed to bend in her , to give , and she put her arms around him , clinging to him . Finally , he whispered in her ear , " Let 's get out of here . Let'sgo . " " Yes , " she said , after a moment , " I guess it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his arms at once . She looked at him and she said , " I 'm sorry I was so silly . I know you did n't mean it . " " I 'm sorry , too . I 'm just a jealous , no-good bastard , I ca n't help it , I 'm crazy about you . " And he kissed her again. leaving so soon ! " said Miss Wales . " And we never got a chance to talk ! "  | " Vivaldo , " said Cass , " I 'll call you this week . Ida , I ca n't call you , will you call me ? Let 's get together . " " I 'm waiting for a script from you , you bum , " said Ellis , " just as soon as you climb down out of that makeshift ivory tower . Nice meeting you , Miss Scott . " " He means it , " said Mrs. Ellis . " He really means it . " " I was happy to meet you both , " said Ingram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Richard walked them to the door . " Are we still friends ? " " Are you kidding ? Of course , we 're still friends . " But he wondered if they were . The door closed behind them and they stood in the corridor , staring at each other . " Shall we go home ? " he asked . She watched him , her eyes very large and dark . " You got anything to eat down there ? " " No . But the stores are still open . We can get some-thing . " She took his arm and they walked to the elevator . He rang the bell . He stared at her as though he could not believe his eyes . " Good , " she said . " We 'll get something and I 'll cook you a decent supper . " " I 'm not very hungry , " he said . They heard the elevator door slam beneath them and the elevator began to rise . The smell of the chicken she had fried the night before still hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink . The wishbone lay drying on the table , surrounded by the sticky glasses out of which they had drunk beer , and by their sticky coffee cups . Her clothes were thrown over a chair , his were mainly on the floor . He had awakened , she was asleep . She slept on her side , her dark head turned away from him , making no sound . He leaned up a little and watched her face . Her face would now be , forever , more mysterious and impenetrablep172than the face of any stranger . Strangers ' faces hold no secrets because the imagination does not invest them with any . But the face of a lover is an unknown precisely because it is investedwith so much of oneself . It is a mystery , containing , like all mysteries , the possibility of torment . She slept . He felt that she was sleeping partly in order to avoid him . He fell back on his pillow , staring up at the cracks in the ceiling . She was in his bed but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not with him . In some deep , secret place she watched herself , she held herself in check , she fought him . He felt that she had decided , long ago , precisely where the limits were , how much she could afford to give , and he had not been able to make her give a penny more . She made love to him as though it were a technique of pacification , a means to some other end . However she might wish to delight him , she seemed principally to wish to exhaust him ; and to remain , above all , herself on the banks of pleasure the while she labored mightly to drown him in the tide . His pleasure was enough for her , she seemed to say , his pleasure was hers . But he wanted her pleasure to be his , for them to drown in the tide together . He had slept , but badly , aware of Ida 's body next to his , and aware of a failure more subtle than any he had known before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not before permitted to enter but whose hour , now , had struck . He wondered who had been with her before him ; how many , how often , how long ; what he , or they before him , had meant to her ; and he wondered if her lover , or lovers , had been white or black . What difference does it make ? he asked himself . What difference does any of it make ? One or more , white or black  --  she would tell him one of these days . They would learn everything about each other , they had time , she would tell him . Would she ? Or would she merely accept his secrets as she accepted his body , happy to be the vehicle of his relief ? While offering in return ( for she knew the rules ) revelations intended to pacify and alsop173intended to frustrate him ; to frustrate , that is , any attempt on his part to strike deeper into that incredible country in which , like the princess of fairy tales , sealed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she paced her secret round of secret days . It was early in the morning , around seven , and there was no sound anywhere . The girl beside him stirred silently in her sleep and threw one hand up , as though she had been frightened . The scarlet eye on her little finger flashed . Her heavy hair was wild and tangled and the face she wore in sleep was not the face she wore when awake . She had taken off all her make-up , so that she had scarcely any eyebrows , and her unpainted lips were softer now , and defenseless . Her skin was darker than it was in the daytime and the round , rather high forehead held a dull , mahogany sheen . She looked like a little girl as she slept , but she was not a very trusting little girl ; one hand half-covered her face and the other was hidden between her thighs . It made him think , somehow , of all the sleeping children of the poor . He touched her foreheadlightly with his lips , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom . When he came out he stood staring for a moment at the kitchen , then lit a cigarette , , and brought an ashtray back to the bed with him . He lay on his belly , smoking , his long arms dangling to the floor , where he had placed the ashtray . " What time is it ? " He leaned up , smiling , " I did n't know you were awake . " And , strangely , he suddenly felt terribly shy , as though this was his first time to awaken , naked , next to a naked girl . " Oh , " she said , " I like to watch people when they think I 'm asleep . " " That 's good to know . How long have you been watching me ? " " Not long . Just when you came out of the bathroom . I saw your face and I wondered what you were thinking about . "  | " I was thinking about you . " Then he kissed her . " Good morning . It 's seven-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so early ? " And she yawned and grinned . " No . But I guess I could n't wait to see you again . " " Now , I 'm going to remember that , " she said , " when you start waking up at noon and even later and act like you do n't want to get up out of the bed . " " Well , I may not be so anxious to jump right out of bed . " She motioned for his cigarette and he held it for her while she took a drag or two . Then he put the cigarette out in the ashtray . He leaned over her . " How about you ? " " You 're sweet , " she said , and , after a moment , " you 're a deep-sea diver . " Each of them blushed . He put his hands on her breasts , which were heavy and wide apart , with reddish-brown nipples . Her large shoulders quivered a little , a pulse beat in her neck . She watched him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the same time , frightened . " Love me , " he said . " I want you to love me . " She caught one of his hands as it moved along her belly . " You think I 'm one of those just-love-to-love girls . " " Baby , " he said , " I sure hope so ; we 're going to be great , let me tell you . We have n't even started yet . " His voice had dropped to a whisper and their two hands knotted together in a teasing tug of war . She smiled . " How many times have you said that ? " He paused , looking over her head at the blinds which held back the morning . " I do n't believe I 've ever said it . I 've never felt this way before . " He looked down at her again and kissed her again . " Never . " After a moment she said , " Neither have I. " She said it quickly , as though she had just popped a pill into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its effects . He looked into her eyes . " Is that true ? "  | " Yes . " Then she dropped her eyes . " I 've got to watch my step with you . " " Why ? Do n't you trust me ? " " It 's maybe that I do n't trust myself . " " Maybe you 've never loved a man before , " he said . " I 've never loved a white man , that 's the truth . " " Oh , well , " he said , smiling , trying to empty his mind of the doubts and fears which filled it , " be my guest . " He kissed her again , a little drunk with her heat , her taste , her smell . " Never , " he said , gravely , " never anyone like you . " Her hand relaxed a little and he guided it down . He kissed her neck and shoulders . " I love your colors . You 're so many different , crazy colors . " " Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously , and tried to move her hand away but he held it : the tug of war began again . " I 'm the same old color all over . " " You ca n't see yourself all over . But I can . Part of you is honey , part of you is copper , some of you is gold  --  " " Lord . What 're we going to do with you this morning ? " " I 'll show you . Part of you is black , too , like the entrance to a tunnel  --  " " Vivaldo . " Her head hit the pillow from side to sidein a kind of torment which had nothing to do with him , butfor which , just the same , he was responsible . He put hishand on her forehead , already beginning to be damp , and was struck by the way she then looked at him ; looked at himas though she were , indeed , a virgin , promised at her birth tohim , the bridegroom ; whose face she now saw for the firsttime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone . There was no sound of revelry anywhere , only silence , no help anywhere if not in this bed , violationby the bridegroom 's body her only hope . Yet she tried tosmile . " I 've never met a man like you before . " She said this in a low voice , in a tone that mixed hostility with wonder . " Well , I told you  --  I 've never met a girl like you before , either . " But he wondered what kind of men she had known . Gently , he forced her thighs open ; she allowed him to placep176her hand on his sex . He felt that , for the first time , his body presented itself to her as a mystery and that , immediately , therefore , he , Vivaldo , became totally mysterious in her eyes . She touched hiin for the first time with wonder and terror , realizing that she did not know how to caress him . It was being borne in on her that he wanted her : this meant that she no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of girls like me before , have n't you ? With colored girls . " " I 've slept with lots of all kinds of girls . " There was no laughter between them now ; they whispered , and the heat between then rose . Her odor rose to meet him , it mingled with his own , sharper sweat . He was between her thighs and in her hands , her eyes stared fearfully into his . " But with colored girls , too ? " " Yes . " There was a long pause , she sighed a long , shuddering sigh . She arched her head upward , away from him . " Were they friends of my brother 's ? " " No . No . I paid them . " " Oh . " Her head dropped , she closed her eyes , she brought her thighs together , then opened them . The covers were in his way and he threw them off and then for a moment , half-kneeling , he stared at the honey and the copper and the gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp , trembling gasps . He wanted her to turn her face to him and open her eyes . " Ida . Look at me . " She made a sound , a kind of moan , and turned her face toward him but kept her eyes closed . He took her hand again . " Come on . Help me . " Her eyes opened for a second , veiled , but she smiled . He lowered himself down upon her , slowly , allowing her hands to guide him , and kissed her on the mouth . They locked together , shaking , her hands fluttered upward and settled on his back . I paid them . She sighed again , a different sigh , long and surrendering , and the struggle began.  |p177It  was not like the thrashing of the night before , when she bucked beneath him like an infuriated horse or a beached fish . Now she was attentive to the point of trembling and because he felt that one thoughtless moment would send her slipping and sliding away from him , he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up and down , sometimes seeming to wish to bring him closer , sometimes being tempted to push him away , moved in a terrible , a beautiful indecision , and caused him , brokenly , deep in his throat , to moan . She opened up before him , yet fell back before him , too , he felt that he was traveling up a savage , jungle river , looking for the source which remained hidden just beyond the black , dangerous , dripping foliage . Then , for a moment , they seemed to be breaking through . Her hands broke free , her thighs inexorably loosened , their bellies ground cruelly together , and a curious , low whistle forced itself up through her throat , past her bared teeth . Then she was checked , her hands flew up to his neck , the moment passed . He rested . Then he began again . He had never been so patient , so determined , or so cruel before . Last night she had watched him ; this morning he watched her ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession , even , if at the moment she finally called his name , the heart within him burst . This , anyway , seemed more imminentthan the spilling of his seed . He was aching in a way he had never ached before , was congested in a new way , and wherever her hands had touched him and then fled , he was cold . Her hands clung to his neck as though she were drowningand she was absolutely silent , silent as a child is silent before it finally summons enough breath to scream , before the blow lands , before the long fall begins . And , ruthlessly , viciously , he pushed her to the edge . He did not know whether her body moved with his or not , her body was so nearly his . He felt the bed throbbing beneath them , and heard it sing . Her hands went wild , flying from his neck to his throat to his shoulders . his chest , she began to thrash beneath him , trying to get away and trying to come closer.  |p178Her  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped his friendly body , caressing and scratching and burning . Come on . Come on . He felt a tremor in her belly , just beneath him , as though something had broken there , and it rolled tremendouslyupward , seeming to divide her breasts , as though he had split her all her length . And she moaned . It was a curiously warning sound , as though she were holding up one hand against the ocean . The sound of her helplessness caused all of his affection , tenderness , desire , to return . They were almost there . Come on come on come on come on . Come on ! He began to gallop her , whinnying a little with delight , and , for the first time , became a little cold with fright , that so much of himself , so long damned up , must now come pouring out . Her moans gave way to sobs and cries . Vivaldo . Vivaldo . Vivaldo . She was over the edge . He hung , hung , clinging to her as she clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting , blind . It began to pour out of him like the small weak trickle that precedes disaster in the mines . He felt his whole face pucker , felt the wind in his throat , and called her name again , while all the love in him rushed down , rushed down , and poured itself into her . After a long time , he felt her fingers in his hair and he looked into her face . She was smiling  --  a thoughtful , baffled smile . " Get your big , white self off me . I ca n't move . " He kissed her , weary as he could be , and peaceful . " Tell me something first . " She looked sly and amused and mocking ; very much like a woman and very much like a shy , little girl . " What do you want to know ? " IIe shook her , laughing . " Come on . Tell me . " She kissed him on the tip of his nose . " It never happened to me before  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never . Almost  --  but no , never . " Then , " Was I good for you ? " " Yes . Yes . Do n't ever leave me. "  | " Let me get up . " IIe rolled over on his back and she got out of bed and walked into the bathroom . He watched the tall , dusty body , which now belonged to him , disappear . He heard water running in the bathroom , then he heard the shower . He fell asleep . He woke up in the early afternoon . Ida was standing before the stove , singing . If you ca n't give me a dollar , Give me a lousy dimeShe had washed the dishes , cleaned up the kitchen , and hung up his clothes . Now she was making coffee . Just want to feedThis hungry man of mine.  |p183Eric  sat naked in his rented garden . Flies buzzed and boomed in the brilliant heat , and a yellow bee circled his head . Eric remained very still , then reached for the cigarettes beside him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee away . Yves ' tiny black-and-white kitten stalked the garden as though it were Africa , crouching beneath the mimosas like a panther and leaping into the air . The house and the garden overlooked the sea . Far down the slope , beyond the sand of the beach , in the thunderousblue of the Mediterranean , Yves ' head went under , reappeared , went under again . He vanished entirely . Eric stood up , looking out over the sea , almost poised to run . Yves liked to hold his breath under water for as long as possible , a test of endurance which Eric found pointless and , in Yves ' case , frightening . Then Yves ' head appeared again , and his arm flashed . And , even from this distance , Eric could see that Yves was laughing  --  he had known that Eric would be watching from the garden . Yves began swimming toward the beach . Eric sat down . The kitten rushed over and rubbed itself against his legs . It was the end of May . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were leaving . Not for a long time , perhaps never again , would Eric sit in a garden watching Yves in the water . They would take thep184train for Paris in the morning and , after two days there , Yves would put Eric on the boat for New York . Eric was to get settled there and then Yves was to join him . Now that it had all been decided and there could be no turning back , Eric felt a sour and savage apprehension . He watched as Yves stepped out of the water . His brown hair was bleaching from the sun and glowed about his head ; his long , wiry body was as brown as bread . He bent down to lift off the scarlet bikini . Then he pulled on an old pair of blue jeans which he had expropriated from Eric . They were somewhat too short for him , but no matter  --  Yves was not very fond of Americans , but he liked their clothes . He stalked up the slope , toward the house , the red cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mentioned going to America and had never given Eric any reason to suppose that he nourished such a desire . The desire arrived , or was , in any case , stated , only when the possibility arose : for Eric had slowly graduated from near-starvation to dubbing French films to bit roles in some of the American films produced abroad . One of these bits had led to television work in England ; and then a New York director had offered him one of the principal supportingparts in a Broadway play . This offer had presented Eric with the enormous questionhe had spent three years avoiding . To accept it was to bring his European sojourn to an end ; not to accept it was to transform his sojourn into exile . He and Yves had been together for more than two years and , from the time of their meeting , his home had been with Yves . More precisely and literally , it was Yves who had come to live with him , but each was , for the other , the dwelling place that each had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from Yves . But when he told Yves that , for this reason , he had decided to reject the offer , Yves looked at him shrewdly , and sighed . " Then you should have rejected it right away , or you should never have told me about it at all . You are being sentimental  --   |p185you  are maybe being , even , a little cowardly , no ? You will never make a carriere here in France , you know that as well as I. You will just grow old and discontented and you will make me a terrible life and then I will leave you . But you can become a great star , I think , if you play this part . Would n't you like that ? " He paused , smiling , and Eric shrugged , then blushed . Yves laughed . " How silly you are ! " Then , " I , too , have dreams that I have never spoken of to you , " he said . He was still smiling , but there was an expression in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of a seasoned and able adventurer , trying to decide between pouncing on his prey and luring his prey into a trap . Such decisions are necessarily swift and so it was also the look of someone who was already irresistibly in motion toward whatever it was he wanted ; who would certainly have it . This expression always frightened Eric a little . It seemed not to belong in Yves ' twenty-one-year-old face , to have no relation to his open , childlike grin , his puppylike playfulness , the adolescent ardor with which he embraced , then rejected , people , doctrines , theories . This expressionmade his face extremely bitter , profoundly cruel , ageless ; the nature , the ferocity , of his intelligence was then all in his eyes ; the extraordinary austerity of his high foreheadprefigured his maturity and decay . He touched Eric lightly on the elbow , as a very young child might do . " I have no wish to stay here , " he said , " in this wretched mausoleum of a country . Let us go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no future here , for a boy like me . " The word future caused in Eric a small trembling , a small recoil . " You 'll hate America , " he said , with vehemence . Yves looked at him in surprise . " What kind of future are you dreaming of ? " " I am sure that there is something I can do there , " Yves said , stubbornly . " I can find my way . Do you really thinkp186that I want to be protected by you forever ? " And he consideredEric for a moment as though they were enemies or strangers . " I did n't know you minded being  --  protected  --  by me . " " Ne to fdche pas . I do not mind it ; if I minded it , I would be gone . " He smiled and said , gently , reasonably , " But it can not go on forever , I also am a man . " " What can not go on forever ? " But he knew what Yves meant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , " said Yves , " my youth . It can not last forever . " Then he grinned . " I have always been sure that you would be returning to your country one day . It might as well be now , while you are still fond of me , and I can seduce you into taking me along . " " You 're a great little old seducer , " said Eric , " and that 's the truth . " " Ah , " said Yves , wickedly , " with you it was easy . " Then he looked at Eric gravely . " So it is decided . " It was not a question . " I suppose that I must go and visit my whore of a mother and tell her that she will never see me any more . " And his face darkened and his large mouth grew bitter . His mother had been a bistro waitress when the Germans came to Paris . Yves had then been five years old and his father had vanished so long before that Yves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Germans . " She was really a putain . I remember many times sitting in the cafe , watching her . She did not know I was watching anyway , old people think that children never see anything . The bar was very long , and it curved . I would always be sitting behind it , at the far end , around the curve . There was a mirror above me and I could see them in the mirror . And I could see them in the zinc of the bar . I remember their uniforms and the shine on their leather boots . They were always extremely correct  --  not like the Americans who came later . She would always be laughing , and she moved very fast . Someone 's hand was always on her  --  in her bosom ,  |p187ti|p  her leg . There was always another one at our house , the whole German army , coming all the time . How horrible a people . " And then , as though to give his mother a possible , reluctantjustice : " Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would not have eaten otherwise . But I do not believe that . I think she liked that . I think she was always a whore . She always managedeverything that way . When the Americans came , she found a very pretty officer . He was very nice to me , I must say  --  he had a son of his own in the States that he had only seen one time , and he pretended that I was his son , though I was much older than his son would have been . He made me wish that I had a father , one father , especially "  --  he grinned  --  " an American father , who liked to buy you things and take you on his shoulder everywhere . I was sorry when he went away . I am sure that it was he who kept her from getting her head shaved , as she deserved . She told all kinds of lies about her work in the Resistance . Quelle horreur ! that whole time , it was not very pretty . Many women had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? just becausethey were pretty or someone was jealous or they had refused to sleep with someone . But not my mother . Nous , nous etions tranquille avec notre petit officier and our beefsteakand our chocolate candy . " Then , with a laugh : " Now , she owns that bistro where she used to work . You see what kind of woman she is ? I never go there . " This was not entirely true . He had run away from his mother at fifteen . Or , more accurately , they had established a peculiar truce , to the effect that he would make no trouble for her  --  that is , he would stay out of the hands of the law ; and she would make no trouble for him  --  that is , she would not use his minority status as a means of having him controlled by the law . So Yves had lived by his wits in the streets of Paris , as a semi-tapette , and as a rat d'hotel , until he and Eric had met . And during all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when he was drunk or unbearably hungry or unbearably sad ; or , rather , perhaps , he visited the bistro , which was different now . The long , curving counter had been replaced by a long , straight one . Neon swirled on the ceiling and above the mirrors . There were small , plastictoppedtables , in bright colors , and bright , plastic chairs instead of the wooden tables and chairs Yves remembered . There was a juke box now where the soldiers had clumsily manipulated the metal football players of the baby-foot ; there were Coca-Cola signs , and Coca-Cola . The wooden floor had been covered with black plastic . Only the WC remained the same , a hole in the floor with foot-rests next to it , and torn newspaper hanging from a string . Yves went to the bistro blindly , looking for something he had lost , but it was not there any longer . He sat in the old , vanished corner and watched his mother . The hair which had been brown was now of a chemical and improbably orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thicken and spread and sag . But her laugh remained , and she still seemed , in a kind of violent and joyless helplessness , to be seeking and fleeing the hands of men . Eventually , she would come to his end of the bar . " Je t'offre quelque chose , M'sieu ? " With a bright , forced , wistful smile . " Un cognac , Madame . " With a wry grin , and the sketch of a sardonic bow . When she was halfway down the bar , he yelled . " Un double ! " " Ah ! Bien stir , M'sieu . " She brought him his drink and a small drink for herself , and watched him . They touched glasses . " A la votre , Madame . " " A la vdtre , M'sieu . " But sometimes he said : " A nos amours . " And she repeated dryly : " A nos amours ! "  |p189They  drank in silence for a few seconds . Then she smiled . " You look very well . You have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why should you be proud of me ? I am just a good-fornothing , it is just as well that I am good-looking , that 's how I live . " And he watched her . " Tu comprends , hero ? " " If you talk that way , I want to know nothing , nothing , of your life ! " " Why not ? It is just like yours , when you were young . Or maybe even now , how can I tell ? " She sipped her cognac and raised her chin . " Why do n't you come back ? You can see for yourself how well the bar does , it would be a good situation for you . Et puffs " Et puis quoi ? " " I am no longer very , very young , it would be un soulagement if my son and I could be friends . " And Yves laughed . " You need friends ? Go dig up some of those that you buried in order to get this bar . Friends ! Je vent vivre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , when she said this , she dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief . " Do n't bother me any more , you know what I think of you , go back to your clients . " And the last word was thrown at his mother , like a curse ; sometimes , if he were drunk enough , there were tears in his eyes . He would let his mother get halfway down the bar before he shouted . " Merci , pour le cognac , Madame ! " And she turned , with a slight bow , saying , " De rien , M'sieu . " Eric had been there with him once , and had rather liked Yves ' mother , but they had never gone back . And they had scarcely ever spoken of it . There was something hidden in it which Yves did not want to see . Now , Yves leapt over the low stone wall and entered the garden , grinning.  | " You should have come in the water with me , it was wonderful . It would do wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting ? " He flicked at Eric 's belly with his bikini and fell on the ground beside him . The kitten approached cautiously , sniffing Yves ' foot as though it were investigating some prehistoricmonstrosity , and Yves grabbed it , holding it against his shoulder , and stroking it . The kitten closed its eyes and began to purr . " You see how she loves me ? It is a pity to leave her here , let us take her with us to New York . " " Getting you into America is going to be hassle enough , baby , let 's not rock the boat . Besides , New York is full of alley cats . And alleys . " He said this with his eyes closed , drinking in the sun and the odors of the garden and the dark , salty odors of Yves . The children from the nearby house were still on the beach ; he could hear their voices . " You have no sympathy for animals . She will suffer terribly when we go away . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He kept his eyes closed . IIe felt Yves turn to look down at him . " Why are you so troubled about going to New York ? " " New York 's a very troubling place . " " I am not afraid of trouble . " He touched Eric lightly on the chest and Eric opened his eyes . He stared up into Yves ' grave , brown , affectionate face . " But you are . You are afraid of trouble in New York . Why ? " " I 'm not afraid , Yves . But I have had a lot of trouble there . " " We have had much trouble here , too , " said Yves , with his abrupt and always rather shocking gravity , " and we have always come out of it and now we are better than ever , I think , no ? " " Yes , " said Eric , slowly , and watched Yves ' face . " Well , then , what use is there to worry ? " He pushedp191Eric 's hair back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in the sun too long . " Eric grabbed his hand . The kitten leapt away . " Jesus . I 'm going to miss you . " " It is for so short a time . You will be busy , I will be in New York before you know we have been apart . " He grinned and put his chin on Eric 's chest . " Tell me about New York . You have many friends there ? Many famous friends ? " Eric laughed . " Not many famous friends , no . I do n't know if I have any friends there now , I 've been away so long . " " Who were your friends when you left ? " He grinned again and rubbed his cheek against Eric 's . " Boys like me ? " " There are no boys like you . Thank God . " " You mean not so pretty as I ? Or not so warm ? " He put his hands on Yves ' salty , sandy shoulders . He heard the children 's voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . " No . Not so impossible . " " Naturally , now that you are about to leave , you find me impossible . And from what point of view ? " He drew Yves closer . " From every point of view . " " C'est dommage . Moi , je t'aime bien . " These words were whispered against his ear , and they lay still for a few moments . Eric wanted to ask , Is that true ? but he knew that it was true . Perhaps he did not know what it meant , but , there , Yves could not help him . Only time might help , time which surrendered all secrets but only on the inexorable condition , as far as he could tell , that the secret could no longer be used . He put his lips to Yves ' shoulder and tasted the Mediterraneansalt . He thought of his friends  --  what friends ? He was not sure that he had ever really been friends with Vivaldo or Richard or Cass ; and Rufus was dead . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had sent him the news  --  he had the feeling that it had to be Cass . It could scarcely have been Vivaldo , who was made too uneasy by what he knew of Eric 's relation to Rufus  --  knew without beingp192willing to admit that he knew ; and it would certainly not have been Richard . No one , in any case , had written very often ; he had not really wanted to know what was happening among the people he had fled ; and he felt that they had always protected themselves against any knowledge of what was happening in him . No , Rufus had been his only friend among them . Rufus had made him suffer , but Rufus had dared to know him . And when Eric 's pain had faded , and Rufus was far away , Eric remembered only the joy that they had sometimes shared , and the timbre of Rufus ' voice , his half-beat , loping , cocky walk , his smile , the way he held a cigarette , the way he threw back his head when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded him of Rufus  --  something in his trusting smile and his brave , tough vulnerability . It was a Thursday when the news came . It was pouring down rain , all of Paris was wavering and gray . He had no money at all that day , was waiting for a check which was mysteriously entangled in one of the bureaucratic webs of the French cinema industry . He and Yves had just divided the last of their cigarettes and Yves had gone off to try and borrow money from an Egyptian banker who had once been fond of him . Eric had then lived on the Rue de la Montagne Ste. Genevieve , and he labored up this hill , in the flood , bareheaded , with water dripping down his nose and eyelashes and behind his ears and down his back and soaking through his trench-coat pocket , where he had unwisely placed the cigarettes . He could practically feel them disintegrating in the moist , unclean darkness of his pocket , not at all protected by his slippery hand . He was in a kind of numb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes and stay in bed until help came ; help would probably be Yves , with the money for sandwiches ; it would be just enough help to enable them to get through yet another ghastly day . He traversed the great courtyard and started up the steps of his building ; and behind him , near the porte-cochere ,  |p193the  bell of the concierge 's loge sounded , and she called his name . He went back , hoping that she was not going to ask him about his rent . She stood in her door , with a letter in her hand . " This just came , " she said . " I thought it might be important . " " Thank you , " he said . She , too , hoped that it might be the money he was waiting for , but she closed her door behind her . It was nearly suppertime and she was cooking ; in fact , the entire street seemed to be cooking , and his legs threatened to give way beneath him . He did not look carefully at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the recalcitrant check , and he was not expecting a check from America , which was where the letter came from ; and he crumpled it up , unread , in his trench-coat pocket and crossed the courtyard and went upstairs to his room . There , he put the letter on the table , dried himself , and undressed and got under the covers . Then he lay the cigarettes out to dry , lit the driest one , and looked at the letter again . It seemed a very ordinary letter , until the paragraph beginning We were all very fond of him , and I know that you were , too  --  yes , it must have been Cass who wrote . Rufus was dead , and by his own hand . Rufus was dead . Boys like me ? Yves had teased . How could he tell the boy who lay beside him now anything about Rufus ? It had taken him a long while to realize that one of the reasons Yves had so stirred his heart , stirred it in a way he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded him , somehow , somewhere , of Rufus . And it had taken him almost until this very moment , on the eve of his departure , to begin to recognize that part of Rufus ' great power over him had to do with the past which Eric had buried in some deep , dark place ; was connected with himself , in Alabama , when I was n't nothing but a child ; with the cold white people andp194the warm , black people , warm at least for him , and as necessary as the sun which bathed the bodies of himself and his lover now . Lying in this garden now , so warm , covered , and apprehensive , he saw them on the angular , blazing streets of his childhood , and in the shuttered houses , and in the fields . They laughed differently from other people , so it had seemed to him , and moved with more beauty and violence , and they smelled like good things in the oven . But had he ever loved Rufus ? Or had it simply been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the body of Rufus to which he had clung , or the bodies of dark men , seen briefly , somewhere , in a garden or a clearing , long ago , sweat running down their chocolate chests and shoulders , their voices ringing out , the white of their jock-straps beautifulagainst their skin , one with his head tilted back before a dipper  --  and the water splashing , sparkling , singing down !  --  one with his arm raised , laying an axe to the base of a tree ? Certainly he had never succeeded in making Rufus believe he loved him . Perhaps Rufus had looked into his eyes and seen those dark men Eric saw , and hated him for it . He lay very still , feeling Yves ' unmoving , trusting weight , feeling the sun . " Yves ? " " Oui , mon thou ? " " Let 's go inside . I think , maybe , I 'd like to take a shower and have a drink . I 'm beginning to feel sticky . " " Ah , les americains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . " But he raised his head and kissed Eric swiftly on the tip of his nose and stood up . He stood between Eric and the sun ; his hair very bright , his face in shadow . He looked down at Eric and grinned . " A/ors to es toujours fret , toi , d'apres ce que je vois . " Eric laughed . " Et toi , salaud ? " " Mais moi , je suis francais , mon cher , je suis pas puritain , fort heureusement . T'aura du to rendre cornfete d'ailleurs . " He pulled Eric to his feet and slapped him on the buttocks with the red bikini . " Viens . Take your shower . I think wep195have almost nothing left to drink , I will bicycle down to the village . What shall I get ? " " Some whiskey ? " " Naturally , since that is the most expensive . Are we eatingin or out ? " They started into the house , with their arms around each other . " Try to get Madame Belet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want to eat ? " " I do n't care . Whatever you want . " The house was long and low , built of stone , and very cool and dark after the heat and brightness of the kitchen . The kitten had followed them in and now murmured insistentlyat their feet . " Perhaps I will feed her before I go . It will only take a minute . " " She ca n't be hungry yet , she eats all the time , " said Eric . But Yves had already begun preparing the kitten 's food . They had entered through the kitchen and Eric walked through it and through the dining salon , into their bedroom , and threw himself down on the bed . The bedroom also had an entrance on the garden . The mimosas pressed against the window , and beyond these were two or three orange trees , holding hard , small oranges , like Christmas balls . There were olive trees in the garden , too , but they had been long untended ; it was not worth anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new play was on the plain wooden table which , along with the fireplace in the dining room , had persuaded them to rent the house ; on the table , too , were a few books , Yves ' copies of Blaise Cendrars and Jean Genet and Marcel Proust , Eric 's copies of An Actor Prepares and The Wings of the Dove and Native Son . Yves ' sketch pad was on the the floor . So were his tennis shoes and his socks and his underwear , all of these embracing Eric 's sport shirtsp196and sandals and bathing trunks  --  less explicit and more somber than Yves ' bikini , these last , as Eric himself was less explicit and more sombre . Yves clattered into the bedroom . " Are you going to take that shower or not ? " " Yes . Right away . " " Well , start . I am leaving now , I will be back in a moment . " " I know your moments . Try not to get too drunk with the natives . " He grinned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the floor , put them on , and put on his tennis shoes , and a faded blue pullover . " Ah . Celui-ld , je to jure . " He took a comb from his pocket and pulled it through his hair , with the result that it stood up more wildly than ever . " I 'll put you on your bicycle . " They walked past the mimosas . " Hurry back , " said Eric ; smiling , staring at Yves . Yves picked up his bicycle . " I will be back before you are dry . " He rolled the bicycle through the gate and onto the road . Eric stood in the garden , watching him . The light was still very bright but , in the mysterious way of southern light , was gathering itself together and would soon be gone . Already , the sea looked darker . Once past the gate , Yves did not look back . Eric turned into the house . He stepped into the shower , which was off the bedroom . He fumbled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first too cold , but he forced himself to take it , then too hot ; he fumbled with the knobs until the water became more bearable . He soaped himself , wondering if he were really getting fat . His belly seemed firm enough , but he had always had a tendency to be chunky and square ; it was just as well that he would soon , in New York , be going again to the gym . And the thought of the gym , while the water fell down over him , he was alone with his body and the water , caused many painful and buried things to stirp197in him . Now that his flight was so rigorously approaching its end , a light appeared , a backward light , throwing his terrors into relief . And what were these terrors ? They were buried beneath the impossible language of the time , lived underground where nearly all of the time 's true feeling spitefully and incessantlyfermented . Precisely , therefore , to the extent that they were inexpressible , were these terrors mighty ; precisely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And because the taste for obscenity is universal and the appetite for reality rare and hard to cultivate , he had nearly perished in the basement of his private life . Or , more precisely , his fantasies . These fantasies began as fantasies of love and soured imperceptibly into fantasies of violence and humiliation . When he was little he had been very much alone , for his mother was a civic leader , always busy with clubs and banquets and speeches and proposals and manifestoes , aloft forever on a sea of flowered hats ; and his father , rather submergedby this glittering and resounding tide , made his home in the bank and on the golf course , in hunting lodges , and at poker tables . There seemed to be very little between his father and his mother , very little , that is , beyond habit and courtesy and coercion ; and perhaps each had loved him , but this was never real to him , since they so clearly did not love each other . He had loved the cook , a black woman named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coddled him , and dried the tears which scarcely anyone else in the household ever saw . But , even more than he had loved Grace , he had loved her husband , Henry . Henry was younger , or seemed younger , than his wife . He was a trial to Grace , and probably to them all , because he drank too much . He was the handyman and one of his duties was the care of the furnace . Eric still remembered the look and the smell of the glaring furnace room , the red shadows from the furnace playing along the walls , and the stickysweetsmell of Henry 's breath . They had spent many hoursp198together there , Eric on a box at Henry 's knee , Henry with his hand on Eric 's neck or shoulder . His voice fell over Eric like waves of safety . He was full of stories . He told the story of how he had met Grace , and how he had seduced her , and how ( as he supposed ) he had persuaded her to marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town  --  they seemed , in his part of town , to have much in common , and , often , to be the same people  --  how he had outwitted this one and that one , and how , once , he had managed to escape being put on the chain gang . ( And he had explained to Eric what a chain gang was . ) Once , Eric had walked into the furnace room where Henry sat alone ; when he spoke , Henry did not answer ; and when he approached him , putting his hand on Henry 's knee , the man 's tears scalded the back of his hand . Eric no longer remembered the cause of Henry 's tears , but he would never forget the wonder with which he then touched Henry 's face , or what the shaking of Henry 's body had caused him to feel . He had thrown himself into Henry 's arms , almost sobbing himself , and yet somehow wise enough to hold his own tears back . He was filled with an unutterably painful rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time he had felt a man 's arms around him , the first time he had felt the chest and belly of a man ; he had been ten or eleven years old . He had been terribly frightened , obscurely and profoundly frightened , but he had not , as the years were to prove , been frightened enough . He knew that what he felt was somehow wrong , and must be kept a secret ; but he thought that it was wrong because Henry was a grown man , and colored , and he was a little boy , and white . Henry and Grace were eventually banished , due to some lapse or offense on Henry 's part . Since Eric 's parents had never approved of those sessions in the furnace room , Eric always suspected this as the reason for Henry 's banishment , which made his opposition to his parents more bitter than ever . In any case , he lived his life far from them , at school by day and before his mirror by night , dressed up inp199his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been able to collect , posturing and , in a whisper , declaiming . He knew that this was wrong , too , though he could not have said why . But by this time he knew that everything he did was wrong in the eyes of his parents , and in the eyes of the world , and that , therefore , everything must be lived in secret . The trouble with a secret life is that it is very frequentlya secret from the person who lives it and not at all a secret for the people he encounters . He encounters , because he must encounter , those people who see his secrecy before they see anything else , and who drag these secrets out of him ; sometimes with the intention of using them against him , sometimes with more benevolent intent ; but , whatever the intent , the moment is awful and the accumulatingrevelation is an unspeakable anguish . The aim of the dreamer , after all , is merely to go on dreaming and not to be molested by the world . His dreams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life are antithetical to those of the dreamer , and the teeth of the world are sharp . How could Eric have known that his fantasies , however unreadable they were for him , were inscribed in every one of his gestures , were betrayed in every inflection of his voice , and lived in his eyes with all the brilliance and beauty and terror of desire ? He had always been a heavy , healthy boy , had played like other children , and fought as they did , made friends and enemies and secret pacts and grandiose plans . And yet none of his playmates , after all , had ever sat with Henry in the furnace room , or ever kissed Henry on his salty face . They did not , weighed down with discarded hats , gowns , bags , sashes , earrings , capes , and necklaces , turn themselves into make-believe characters after everyone in their house was asleep . Nor could they possibly , at their most extended , have conceived of the people he , in the privacy of night , became : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother as he conceived her to have been when she was young , his mother 's friends as his mother was now ; thep200heroines and heroes of the novels he read , and the movies he saw ; or people he simply put together out of his fantasiesand the available rags . No doubt , at school , the boy with whom he was wrestling failed to feel the curious stabs of terror and pleasure that Eric felt , as they grappled with each other , as one boy pinned the other to the ground ; and if Eric saw the girls at all , he saw mainly their clothes and their hair ; they were not , for him , as were the boys , creatures in a hierarchy , to be adored or feared or despised . None of them looked on each other as he looked on all of them . His dreams were different  --  subtly and cruelly and criminally different : this was not known yet , but it was felt . He was menaced in a way that they were not , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move away from the doomed , which accounted for the invincible distance , increasing with the years , which stretched between himself and his contemporaries . And , of course , in Eric 's case , in Alabama , his increasing isolation and strangeness was held , even by himself , to he due to the extreme unpopularity of his racial attitudes  --  or , rather , as far as the world in which he moved was concerned , the lack of any responsible attitudes at all . The town in which Eric lived was celebrated and well-to-do , but it was not very big ; as far as Eric was concerned , the South was not very big , certainly , as it turned out , not big enough for him ; and he was the only son of very prominent people . So it was not long before his appearance anywhere caused heads to shake , lips to purse , tongues to stiffen or else , violently , venomously , to curl around his name . Which was also , however , his father 's name , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , the hideous obsequiousnessof people who depised him but who did not dare to say so . They had long ago given up saying anything which they really felt , had given it up so long ago that they were now incapable of feeling anything which was not felt by a mob . Now , Eric stepped out of the shower , rubbing hisp201body with the enormous , rough , white towel Yves had placed in the bathroom for him . Yves did not like showers , he preferred long , scalding baths , with newspapers , cigarettes , and whiskey on a chair next to the bathtub , and with Eric nearby to talk to , to shampoo his hair , and to scrub his back . The thought of the Oriental opulence which overtook Yves each time he bathed caused Eric to smile . He smiled , but he was troubled , too . And as he put on his bathrobe , his body tingled less from the effect of the towel and the toilet water than from his image , abruptly overwhelming , of Yves leaning back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , a peaceful , abstracted look on his face and his sex gleaming and bobbing in the soapy water like a limp , cylindrical fish ; and from his memory , to which his image was somehow the gateway , of that moment , nearly fifteen years ago , when the blow had inexorably fallen and his shame and his battle and his exile had begun . He walked into the ( lining room and poured himself a drink . Then the bottle was empty and he dropped it in the waste basket . He lit a cigarette and sat down in a chair near the window , overlooking the sea . The sun was sinking and the sea was on fire . The sun had been sinking on that far-off day , a Sunday , a hot day . The church bells had ceased and the silence of the South hung heavy over that town . The trees along the walks gave no shade . The white houses , with their blank front doors , their blackly shadowed porches , seemed to be in battle with the sun , laboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a porch , one might discern in its depths a still , shadowed , faceless figure . The interminable pickaninnies were playing in the invincible dirt  --  where Eric was walking that clay , on a back road , near the edge of town , with a colored boy . His name was LeRoy , lie was seventeen , a year older than Eric , and he worked as a porter in the courthouse . He was tall and very black , and taciturn ; Eric always wondered what he was thinking . They had been friends for a long time , from the time of Henry'sp202banishment . But now their friendship , their effort to continuean impossible connection , was beginning to be a burdenfor them both . It would have been simpler  --  perhapsifLeRoy had worked for Eric 's family . Then all would have been permitted , would have been covered by the assumptionof Eric 's responsibility for his colored boy . But , as things were , it was suspect , it was indecent , that a white boy , especially of Eric 's class and difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , after one of his inferiors . Eric had no choice but to run , to insist  --  LeRoy could certainlynot come visiting him . And yet there was something absolutely humiliating in his position ; he felt it very sharply and sadly , and he knew that LeRoy felt it , too . Eric did not know , or perhaps he did not want to know , that he made LeRoy 's life more difficult and increased the danger in which LeRoy walked  --  for LeRoy was considered " bad , " as lacking , that is , in respect for white people . Eric did not know , though of course LeRoy did , what was already being suggested about him all over town . Eric had not guessed , though LeRoy knew only too well , that the Negroes did not like him , either . They suspectedthe motives of his friendliness . They looked for the base one and naturally they found it . So , shortly before , when Eric had appeared in the road , his hands in his pockets , a hoarse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his porch and come to meet him , striding toward Eric as though he were an enemy . There was a snicker from LeRoy 's porch , quickly muffled ; a screen door slammed ; every eye on the street was on them . Eric stammered , " I just dropped by to see what you were doing . " LeRoy spat in the dusty road . " Ai n't doing nothing . Ai n't you got nothing to do ? " " You want to take a walk ? " Eric asked . For a moment it really seemed that LeRoy was going to refuse , for his scowl deepened . Then a faint smile touchedp203his lips . " Okay . But I ca n't walk far . I got to get back . " They began to walk . " I want to get out of this town , " Eric said , suddenly . " You and me both , " said LeRoy . " Maybe we can go North together , " Eric said , after a moment , " where do you think 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco ? " He had wanted to say Hollywood , because he had a dim notion of trying to become a movie star . But he could not really imagine LeRoy as a movie star , and he did not want to seem to want anything LeRoy could not have . " I ca n't be thinking about leaving . I got my Ma and all them kids to worry about . " He looked at Eric and laughed , but it was not an entirely pleasant laugh . " Ai n't everybody 's old man runs a bank , you know . " He picked up a pebble and threw it at a tree . " Hell , my old man do n't give me no money . He certainlywo n't give me any money to go North . He wants me to stay right here . " " He going to die one day , Eric , he going to have to leave it to somebody , now who you think it 's going to be ? Me ? " And he laughed again . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , waiting for my papa to die . That 's certainly not much to look forward to . " And he tried to laugh , to match his tone to LeRoy 's . But he did not really understand LeRoy 's tone . What was wrong between them today ? For it was no longer merely the world  --  there was something unspoken between them , somethingunspeakable , undone , and hideously desired . And yet , on that far-off , burning day , though this knowledge clamored in him and fell all around him , like the sun , and everything in him was aching and yearning for the act , he could not , to save his soul , have named it . It had yet to reach the threshold of his imagination ; and it had no name , no name for him anyway , though for other people , so he had heard , it had dreadful names . It had only a shapep204and the shape was LeRoy and LeRoy contained the mystery which had him by the throat . And he put his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head against LeRoy 's chin . " Well , you got it to look forward to , whether you like it or not , " LeRoy said . He put one hand on Eric 's neck . " But I guess you know what I got to look forward to . " And Eric felt that he wished to say more , but did not know how . They walked on a few seconds in silence and LeRoy 's opportunity came . A cream-colored roadster , bearing six young people , three white boys and three white girls , came up the road in a violent swirl and wake of dust . Eric and LeRoy did not have time to move apart , and a great laugh came from the car , and the driver beat out a mocking version of the wedding march on his horn  --  then kept his entire palm on it as the car shot down the road , away . All of the people in the car were people with whom Eric had grown up . He felt his face flame and he and LeRoy moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a curiously noncommittal pity . " Now that 's what you supposed to be doing , " he said  --  he said it very gently , looking at Eric , licking his lower Iip  --  " and that 's where you supposed to be . You ai n't supposedto be walking around this damn country road with no nigger . " " I do n't give a damn about those people , " Eric said  --  but he knew that he was lying and he knew that LeRoy knew it , too  --  " those people do n't mean a thing to me . " LeRoy looked more pitying than ever , and also looked exasperated . The road now was empty , not a creature moved on it ; it was yellow-red and brown and trees leaned over it , with fire falling through the leaves ; and the road now began to drop beneath them , toward the railroad tracks and the warehouse . This was the town 's dividing line and they always turned off the road at this point , into a clump of trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this haven . His touch was different today ; insistent , gentle , ferocious , and resigned . " Besides , " said Eric , helplessly , " you 're not a nigger , not for me , you 're LeRoy , you 're my friend , and I love you . " The words took his breath away and tears came to his eyes and they paused in the fiery shadow of a tree . LeRoy leaned against the tree , staring at Eric , with a terrible expression on his black face . The expression on LeRoy 's face frightened him , but he labored upward against his fear , and brought out , " I do n't know why people ca n't do what they want to do ; what harm are we doing to anybody ? " LeRoy laughed . He reached out and pulled Eric against him , under the shadow of the leaves . " Poor little rich boy , " he said , " tell me what you want to do . " Eric stared at him . Nothing could have moved him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the terrible , new touch of his body ; and yet , in the same way that he knew that everything he had ever wanted or done was wrong , he knew that this was wrong , and he felt himself falling . Falling where ? He clung to LeRoy , whose arms tightened around him . " Poor boy , " LeRoy murmured again , " poor boy . " Eric buried his face in LeRoy 's neck and LeRoy 's body shook a little  --  the chest and belly of a man !  --  and then he pushed Eric away and guided him toward the stream and they sat down beside it . " I guess you know , now , " LeRoy said , after a long silence , while Eric trailed his hand in the water , " what they saying about us in this town . I do n't care but it can get us in a lot of trouble and you got to stop coming to see me , Eric . " He had not known what they were saying , or he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew now . He said , staring into the water , and with a totally mysterious abandon , " Well , if we 've got the name , we might as well have the game is how I see it . I do n't give a shit about those people , let them all go to hell ; what have they got to do with you and me ? " LeRoy looked briefly over at Eric and smiled . " Youp206a nice boy , Eric , but you do n't know the score . Your Daddy owns half the folks in this town , ai n't but so much they can do to you . But what they can do to me ! " And he spread his hands wide . " I wo n't let anything happen to you . " LeRoy laughed . " You better get out of this town . Declare , they going to lynch you before they get around to me . " He laughed again and rubbed his hand in Eric 's bright red hair . Eric grabbed his hand . They looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . " Boy , " LeRoy said , weakly . And then , after a moment , " You really out for trouble , ai n't you ? " And then nothing was said . They lay together beside the stream . That clay . That day . Had he known where that day would lead him would he have writhed as he did , in such an anguished joy , beneath the great weight of his first lover ? But if he had known , or been capable of caring , where such a day might lead him , it could never have been his necessity to bring about such a day . He was frightened and in pain and the boy who held him so relentlessly was suddenly a stranger ; and yet this stranger worked in Eric an eternal , a healing transformation . Many years were to pass before he could begin to accept what he , that day , in those arms , with the stream whispering in his ear , discovered ; and yet that day was the beginning of his life as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , revealed and it did not matter that , fifteen years later , he sat in an armchair , overlooking a foreign sea , still struggling to find the grace which would allow him to bear that revelation . For the meaning of revelation is that what is revealed is true , and must be borne . But how to bear it ? He rose from his seat and paced restlessly into the garden . The kitten lay curled on the stone doorstep , in the last of the sun , asleep . Then he heard Yves ' bicycle bell and , shortly , Yves ' head appeared above the low stone wall . He passed , looking straight ahead ,  |p207and  then Eric heard him in the kitchen , bumping into things and opening and closing the icebox door . Then Yves stood beside him . " Madame Belet will be here in a few moments . She is cooking for us a chicken . And I have bought some whiskey and some cigarettes . " Then he looked at Eric and frowned . " You are mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is down and it is getting cold . Come in and get dressed , I will make us both a drink . " " What would I do without you ? " " I wonder . " Eric followed him into the house . " I also bought some champagne , " Yves said , suddenly , and he turned to face Eric with a small , shy smile , " to celebrate our last night here . " Then he walked into the kitchen . " Get dressed , " lie called , " Madame Belet will be here soon . " Eric stepped into the bedroom and began putting on his clothes . " Are we going out after dinner ? " " Perhaps . That depends . If we are not too drunk on hampagne . " " I 'd just as soon stay in , I think . " " Oh , perhaps we must have just one last look at our little seaside town . " " We have to get packed , you know , and clean up this house a little , and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean it for us . Anyway , we would never be able to get it done . We can sleep on the train . nd we do not have so very much to pack . " Eric heard him washing the glasses . Then lie began to whistle a tune which sounded like a free improvisation on Bach . Eric combed his hair , which was too long . He decided that he would get it cut very short before he went back to the States . Eventually , they sat , as they had sat so many evenings , before the window which overlooked the sea . Yves sat on the hassock , the back of his head resting on Eric 's knee . " I will be very sad to leave here , " Yves said , suddenly . " I have never been happier than I have been in this house . "  |p208Eric  stroked Yves ' hair and said nothing . He watched the lights that played on the still , black sea , from the sky and the shore . " I have been very happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then : " I wonder if we will ever be so happy again happy I may become , and I ani sure that I shall have great moments yet , this house will always stay with me . I found out something here . " " And what was that ? " Yves turned his head and looked up at Eric . " I was afraid that I would just remain a street boy forever , that I was no better than my mother . " He turned away , toward the window again . " But , somehow , down here in this house with you , I finally realized that that is not so . I have not to be a whore just because I come from whores . I am better than that . " He stopped . " I learned that from you . That is really strange , for , you know ? in the beginning I thought you thought of me like that . I thought that you were just another sordid American , looking for a pretty , degenerate boy . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped his whiskey . " Au fait , to es plutot moche . " " Oh . Ca va . " " Your nose turns up . " He stroked the tip of Yves ' nose . " And your mouth 's too big "  --  Yves laughed  --  " and your forehead 's too high and soon you wo n't have any hair . " He stroked Yves ' forehead , stroked his hair . " And those ears , baby ! you look like an elephant or a flying machine . " " You are the first person who ever say that I am ugly . Perhaps that is why I am intrigued . " He laughed . " Well . Your eyes are not too bad . " " Tu parle . J'ai du clrien , moi . " " Well , yes , baby , now that you mention it , I 'm afraid you 've got a point . " They were silent for a moment . " I have been with so many horrible people , " Yves said ,  |p209gravely  , " so soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonder that I am not completely sauvage . " He sipped his whiskey . Eric could not see his face , but he could imagine the expression it held : hard and baffled and terribly young , with the cruelty that comes from pain and fear . " First , my mother and all those soldiers , ils etaient mes oncles , tous , " and he laughed , " and then all those awful , slimy men , I no longer know how many . " He was silent again . " I lay in the bed , sometimes we never got to bed , and let them grunt and slobber . Some of them were really fantastic , no whore has ever told the truth about who comes to her , I am sure of that , they would chop off her head before they would dare to hear it . But it is happening , it is happening all the time . " He leaned up , hugging his knees , staring at the sea . " Then I would take their money ; if they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , it was very easy to scare them . Most of those people are cowards . " Then he said , in a low voice , " I never thought that I would be happy to have a man touch me and hold me . I never thought that I would be able , truly , to make love with a man . Or with anyone . " " Why , " Eric asked at last , " did n't you use women instead of men , as you despised the men so much ? " Yves was silent . Then , " I do n't know . D'abord , I took what there was  --  or allowed what there was to take me , " and he looked at Eric and grinned . He sipped his whiskey and stood up . " It is simpler with men , it is usually shorter , the money is easier . Women are much more cunning than men , especially those women who would go after a boy like me , and even more unattractive , really . " He laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sure . " His face dropped again into its incongruous , austere melancholy . " You do not meet many women in the places I have been ; you do not meet many human persons at all . They are all dead . Dead . " He stopped , his lips pursed , his eyes glittering in the light that fell though the window . " There were many whores in my mother 's place , but  --  well , yes , there have been a few women , but I could n't stand them , either . " He moved top210the window and stood there with his back to Eric . " I do not like l'elegance des femmes . Every time I see a woman wearing her fur coats and her jewels and her gowns , I want to tear all that off her and drag her someplace , to a pissoir , and make her smell the smell of many men , the piss of many men , and make her know that that is what she is for , she is no better than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , anyway , she only got by blackmailing some stupid man . " Eric laughed , but he was frightened . " Comme to es feroce ! " He watched Yves turn from the window and slowly pace the room  --  long and lean , like a stalking cat , and in the heavy shadows . And he saw that Yves ' body was changing , was losing the adolescent , poverty-stricken harshness . He was becoming a man . And he watched that sullen , wiry body . He watched his face . The dome of his forehead seemed more remarkable than ever , and more pure , and his mouth seemed , at once , more cruel and more defenseless . This nakedness wh. , the proof of Yves ' love and trust , and it was also the proof of Yves ' force . Yves , one day , would no longer need Eric as he needed Eric now . Now , Yves tilted back his head and finished his drink and turned to Eric with a smile . " You are drinking very slowly tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting old . " But he laughed and finished his drink and handed his glass to Yves . And , as Yves walked away from him , as he heard him in the kitchen , as he looked out over the yellow , winking lights along the shore , something opened in him , an unspeakable despair swept over him . Madame Belet had arrived and he heard Yves and the old peasant woman in the kitchen . Their voices were muted . On the day that Yves no longer needed him , Eric would drop back into chaos . He remembered that army of lonely men who had used him , who had wrestled with him , caressedp211him , and submitted to him , in a darkness deeper than the darkest night . It was not merely his body they had used , but something else ; his infirmity had made him the receptacle of an anguish which he could scarcely believe was in the world . This anguish rendered him helpless , though it also lent him his weird , doomed grace and power , and it baffled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sometimes dreamed of walking out of the drama in which he was entangledand playing some other role . But all the exits were barred  --  were barred by avid men ; the role he played was necessary , and not only to himself . And he thought of these men , that ignorant army . They were husbands , they were fathers , gangsters , football players , rovers ; and they were everywhere . Or they were , in any case , in all of the places he had been assured they could not be found and the need they brought to him was one they scarcely knew they had , which they spent their lives denying , which overtook and drugged them , making their limbs as heavy as those of sleepers or drowning bathers , and which could only be satisfied in the shameful , the punishing dark , and quickly , with flight and aversion as the issue of the act . They fled , with the infection lanced but with the root of the infection still in them . Days or weeks or months might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furtively , in an empty locker room , on an empty stairway or a roof , in the shadow of a wall in the park , in a parked car , or in the furnished room of an absent friend , they surrendered to the hands , to the stroking and fondling and kissing of the despised and anonymous sex . And yet the need did not seem to be predominantly physical . It could not be said that they were attracted to men . They did not make love , they were passive , they were acted on . The need seemed , indeed , to be precisely this passivity , this gift of illicit pleasure , this adoration . They came , this army , not out of joy but out of poverty , and in the most tremendous ignorance . Something had been frozen in them , the root of their affections had been frozen , so that they could no longer accept affection , though it was from this lack that they werep212perishing . The dark submission was the shadow of love  --  if only someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , in the light , with joy ! But then they could no longer be passive . Chaos . For the great difference between these men and himself was also the terms of their connection . He saw their vulnerability and they saw his . But they did not love him for this . They used him . He did not love them , either , though he dreamed of it . And the encounter took place , at last , between two dreamers , neither of whom could wake the other , except for the bitterest and briefest of seconds . Then sleep descended again , the search continued , chaos came again . And there was more to it than that . When the liaison so casually begun survived the first encounters , when a kind of shy affection began to force itself up through the frozen ground , and shame abated , chaos more than ever ruled . For shame had not so much abated as found a partner . Affection had appeared , but through a fissure , a crevice , in the person , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the act of love is a confession . One lies about the body but the body does not lie about itself ; it can not lie about the force which drives it . And Eric had discovered , inevitably , the truth about many men , who then wished to drive Eric and the truth together out of the world . And where was honor in all this chaos ? He watched the winking lights and listened to Yves and Madame Belet in the kitchen . Honor . He knew that he had no honor which the world could recognize . His life , passions , trials , loves , were , at worst , filth , and , at best , disease in the eyes of the world , and crimes in the eyes of his countrymen . There were no standardsfor him except those he could make for himself . There were no standards for him because he could not accept the definitions , the hideously mechanical jargon of the age . He saw no one around him worth his envy , did not believe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe in the cures , panaceas , and slogans which afflicted the world he knew ; and this meant that he had to create his standardsp213and make up his definitions as he went along . It was up to him to find out who he was , and it was his necessity to do this , so far as the witchdoctors of the time were concerned , alone . " Mais , bien sur , " he heard Yves saying to Madame Belet , " je suis tout a fait a votre avis . " Madame Belet was very fond of Yves and gave him the benefit , entirely unsolicited , of her seventy-two years ' experience each time she was able to corner him . He could see Yves now , in the kitchen , holding the two drinks in his hand , edging toward the door , a pale , polite , and lonely smile on his face  --  for he had great respect for old people  --  waiting for the pause in Madame Belet 's flow which would allow him to escape . Madame Belet was fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was mainly because she recognized him as Yves ' somewhat unlikely benefactor . If Eric had been French , she would have despised him . But France did not , Dieu merci ! produce such conundrums as Eric , and he was not to be judged by the civilized standards which obtained in her own country . " And what time are you leaving ? " she asked . " Oh , surely not before noon , Madame . " She laughed and Yves laughed . There was something bawdy in their laughter and he could not avoid the feeling , though he suppressed it at once , that they were laughing in league , against him . " I hope you will like America , " said Madame Belet . " I will become very rich there , " said Yves , " and when I come back , I will take you on a pilgrimage to Rome . " For Madame Belet was devout and had never been to Rome , and it was her great hope to see the Holy City before she died . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come back , " Yves said . But his voice was full of doubt . And Eric realized , for the first time , that Yves was afraid . " People who go to America , " said Madame Belet , " never come back . "  | " Au contraire , " said Yves , " they are coming back all the time . " Coming back to what ? Eric asked himself . Madame Belet laughed again . Then their voices dropped . Yves came back into the room . He handed Eric his drink and sat again on the hassock , with his head on Eric 's knee . " I thought I would never get away , " he murmured . " I was thinking of going in to rescue you . " He leaned down and kissed Yves on the neck . Yves put one hand on Eric 's cheek and closed his eyes . They were still . A pulse beat in Yves ' neck . He turned and he and Eric kissed each other on the mouth . They pulled slightly away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlit , leaping room . They stared into each other 's eyes for a long time , and kissed again . Then Eric sighed and leaned back and Yves rested once more against him . Eric wondered what Yves was thinking . Yves ' eyes had carried him back to that moment , nearly two years before , when , in a darkened hotel room , in the town of Chartres , he and Yves had first become lovers . Yves had visited the cathedral once , years before , and he had wanted Eric to see it . And this gesture , this desire to share with Eric something he had loved , marked the end of a testing period , signaled Yves ' turning out of that dark distrust with which he was accustomed to regard the world and with which he had held Eric at bay . They had known each other for more than three months and had seen each other every day , but they had never touched . And Eric had waited , attentive and utterly chaste . The change in him was like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something worth more than all his gold , worth more than all the baubles he has ever purchased ; then , instead of scattering , he begins to assess and hoard and gather up ; all that he has becomes valuable because all that he has may prove to be an unacceptable sacrifice . So Eric waited , praying that this violated urchin would learn to love and trust him . And he knew that the only way he could hopep215to bring this about was to cease violating himself : if he did not love himself , then Yves would never be able to love him , either . So he did what he alone could do , purified , as well as he could , his house , and opened his doors ; established a precariousorder in the heart of his chaos ; and waited for his guest . Yves shifted and sat up and lit a cigarette , then lit one for Eric . " I am beginning to be quite hungry . " " So am I. But we 'll be eating soon . " The kitten wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with one hand . " Do you remember how we met ? " " I will never forget it . I owe a great deal to Beethoven . " Eric smiled . " And to the wonders of modern science . " He had been walking along the Rue des St. Peres on a spring evening , and his thoughts had not been pretty . Paris seemed , and had seemed for a long time , the loneliest city under heaven . And whoever prolongs his sojourn in that city  --  who tries , that is , to make a home there  --  is doomed to discover that there is no one to be blamed for whatever happens to him . Contrary to its legend , Paris does not offer many distractions ; or , those distractions that it offers are like French pastry , vivid and insubstantial , sweet on the tongue and sour in the belly . Then the discontented wanderer is thrown back on himself  --  if his life is to become bearable , only he can make it so . And , on that spring evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boulevard , Eric was in despair . He knew that he had a life to make , but he did not seem to have the tools . Then , as he neared the Boulevard , he heard music . At first , he thought it came from the houses , but then he realized that it was coming from the shadows across the street , where there were no houses . He stood still and listened ; to Beethoven 's " Emperor " Concerto , which was moving away from him . Then , out of the shadows , ahead of him , and on the other side of the street , he saw the long , lean figure of a boy . He stood on the corner , waiting for the lights to change , andp216Eric saw that he was carrying a small portable radio , holding it with both hands . Eric walked to the corner , the lights changed , the boy crossed the street , and Eric followed . Down the long , dark street , the boy on one side and he on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like the violencein his heart , filling the soft , spring air . They reached the corner of the Rue de Rennes . The concertowas approaching its end . To the right , far from them , squatted the bulk of the Gare Montparnasse ; to the left , and somewhat nearer , were the cafes and the Boulevard , and the clean , gray spire of St. Germain-des-Pres . The boy hesitated on the corner ; looked over , briefly , and his eyes met Eric 's . He turned in the direction of St. Germain-des-Pres . Eric crossed the street . Turn-ta-turn , turnta-turn , turn-in-turn , turn-ta-turn ! went the music . " Hello , " Eric said . " I 'm afraid I 've got to hear the end of that concerto . " Yves turned and Eric was immediately struck by his eyes . In the candor with which they regarded him , they were like the eyes of a child ; and yet there was also something in that scrutiny which was not childish at all . Eric felt his heart pound once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is almost ended , " he said . " I know . " They walked in silence , listening to the end of the concerto . When it ended , Yves clicked the radio off . " Will you have a drink with me ? " Eric asked . He said , quickly , " I 'm all by myself , I 've got no one to talk to  --  andandyou do n't run into people playing Beethoven every day . " " That is true , " said Yves , with a smile . " You have a funny accent , where are you from ? " " America . " " I thought it must be America . But which section you are from ? " " The South . Alabama . " " Oh , " said Yves , and looked at him with interest , " then you are raciste. "  | " Why , no , " said Eric , feeling rather stunned , " we are not all like that . " " Oh , " said Yves , majestically , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have noticed that Americans do not like that . " " Well , " said Eric , " that 's not my problem . I left Alabama as fast as I could and if I ever go back there , they 'll probably kill me . " " Have you been here long ? " " About a year . " " And you still know no one ? " " It 's hard to make friends with the French . " " Well . It is only that we are more reserve than you . " " I 'll say you are . " They stopped before the Royal St. Germain . " Shall we have a drink here ? " " It does not matter . " Yves looked over the tables , which were full ; looked through the glass walls into the bar , which was crowded , mostly with young males . " But it is terribly crowded . " " Let 's go someplace else . " They walked to the corner and crossed the street . All of the cafes were full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brasserie Lipp . Eric had been watching Yves with more intensity than he realized ; as they passed the brasserie , it suddenlyflashed through him that Yves was hungry . He did not know how he knew it , for Yves said nothing , did not pause or sigh ; and yet Eric could not have been more certain that the boy was faint with hunger had he abruptly collapsed on the sidewalk . " Look , " Eric said , " I 've got an idea . I 'm starving , I have n't eaten any supper . Come on over to Les Halles with me and let 's get something to eat . And by the time we get back , it wo n't be so crowded over here . " Yves looked at him , his head tilted in a kind of wary , waiting surprise . " It is so far , " he murmured . And he stared at Eric with a bright , suspicious bafflement ; as though he were thinking , Ip218am willing to play all games , my friend , but what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties ? " I 'll bring you back . " He grinned and grabbed Yves ' arm and started for the taxi stand . " Come on , be my guest , you 'll be doing me a favor . What 's your name ? " " Je m'appel Yves . " " My name is Eric . " He had often thought since that , had it not been for that sudden apprehension before the brasserie , he and Yves would never have met again . Their first meal together had given them time , so to speak , to circle around one another . Eric did most of the talking ; the burden of proof was on him . And Yves became less wary and less tight . Eric chattered on , delightedby Yves ' changing face , waiting for his smile , waiting for his laugh . He wanted Yves to know that he was not trying to strike with him the common , brutal bargain ; was not buyinghim a dinner in order to throw him into bed . And by and by this unspoken declaration caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over in his mind . There also appeared in his face a certain fear . It was this fear which Eric sometimes despaired of conquering , in Yves , or in himself . It was the fear of making a total commitment , a vow : it was the fear of being loved . That day in Chartres they had passed through town and watched women kneeling at the edge of the water , pounding clothes against a flat , wooden board . Yves had watched them for a long time . They had wandered up and down the old crooked streets , in the hot sun ; Eric remembered a lizard dartingacross a wall ; and everywhere the cathedral pursued them . It is impossible to be in that town and not be in the shadow of those great towers ; impossible to find oneself on those plains and not be troubled by that cruel and elegant , dogmatic and pagan presence . The town was full of tourists , with their cameras , their three-quarter coats , bright flowered dresses and shirts , their children , college insignia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles crawling like monstrous gleamingbugs over the laming , cobblestoned streets . Tourist buses ,  |p219from  Holland , from Denmark , from Germany , stood in the square before the cathedral . Tow-haired boys and girls , earnest , carrying knapsacks , wearing khaki-colored shorts , with heavy buttocks and thighs , wandered dully through the town . American soldiers , some in uniform , some in civilian clothes , leaned over bridges , entered bistros in strident , uneasy , smilingpacks , circled displays of colored post cards , and picked up meretricious mementos , of a sacred character . All of the beauty of the town , all the energy of the plains , and all the power and dignity of the people seemed to have been sucked out of them by the cathedral . It was as though the cathedral demanded , and received , a perpetual , living sacrifice . It toweredover the town , more like an affliction than a blessing , and made everything seem , by comparison with itself , wretched and makeshift indeed . The houses in which the people lived did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay over them revealed them as mere doomed bits of wood and mineral , set down in the path of a hurricane which , presently , would blow them into eternity . And this shadow lay heavy on the people , too . They seemed stunted and misshapen ; the only color in their faces suggested too much bad wine and too little sun ; even the children seemed to have been hatched in a cellar . It was a town like some towns in the American South , frozen in its history as Lot 's wife was trapped in salt , and doomed , therefore , as its history , that overwhelming , omnipresent gift of God , could not be questioned , to be the property of the gray , unquestioning mediocre . Sometime in the course of the afternoon , though they had only come down from Paris for the day , they decided to spend the night . It was Yves ' suggestion , made when they returned to the cathedral and stood on the steps , looking at the saints and martyrs trapped in stone . Yves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough by now not to push him , not to prod , even not to worry . He knew that Yves ' silences meant that he was fighting some curious war of his own , was coming to some decision of his own ; presently ,  |p220later  today , tomorrow , next week , Yves would abruptly retrace , in speech , the steps he was taking in silence now . And , oddly enough , for it seems not to be the way we live now , for Eric , merely hearing Yves ' footfalls at his side , feeling Yves beside him , and watching that changing face , was joy enough  --  or almost joy enough . They found a hotel which overlooked a stream and took a double room . Their windows overlooked the water ; the towers of the cathedral loomed to the right of them , far away . When they took the room , the sun was setting and great streaks of fire and dull gold were splashed across the still , blue sky . There were trees just outside the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables and chairs , but they were empty ; there did not seem to be many people in the hotel . Yves seated himself in the large window and lit a cigarette , looking down at the tables and chairs . Eric stood next to him , his hand on Yves ' shoulder . " Shall we have a drink down there , old buddy ? " " My God , no ; we shall be eaten up by bugs . Let 's go and find a bistro . " " Okay . " He moved away . Yves stood up . They stared at each other . " I imagine that we must come back early , " Yves said , " there is surely nothing to do in this town . " Then he grinned , mischievously . " Ca va ? " " It was your idea to come here , " Eric said . " Yes . " He turned to the window again . " It is peaceful , yes ? And we can be gentle with each other , we can have a moment together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he turned to Eric again , his eyes were clouded , and his mouth was very vulnerable . After a moment he said , softly , " Let us go . " But it was very nearly a question . And , now , both of them were frightened . For some reason , the towers seemed closer than they had been ; and , suddenly , the two largep221beds , placed close together , seemed the only objects in the room . Eric felt his heart shake and his blood begin to race and then to thicken . He felt that Yves was waiting for him to move , that everything was in his hands ; and he could do nothing . Then it lifted , the red , dangerous shadow , the moment passed , they smiled at each other . Yves walked to the door and opened it . They descended again into the sleepy , the beautiful town . For it was not quite the same town it had been a few hours before . In that second in the room , something had melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now the irresistible current was tugging at them , dragging them slowly , and absolutely surely , to the fulfillment of that promise . And for this reason they hesitated , they dawdled , they deliciously put it off . They chose to eat in an unadorned bistro because it was empty  --  empty when they walked in , anyway , though it was taken over after they had been there for a while , by half a dozen drunk and musical French soldiers . The noise they made might have been unbearable at any other time , but , now , it operated as a kind of protective wall between themselves and the world . It gave them something to laugh at  --  and they needed to laugh ; the distraction the soldiers afforded the other people who had entered the bistro allowed them , briefly , to clasp hands ; and this small preamble to terror steadied their hearts and minds . And then they walked through the town , in which not even a cat seemed to be moving ; and everywhere they walked , the cathedral was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon in the water . Their footfalls rang on the cobblestones . The walls of the houses were all black , they walked through great patches of blackness between one faroffstreet light to another . But the cathedral was lighted . The trees and the tables and chairs and the water were lit by the moon . Yves locked their door behind them and Eric walked to the window and looked at the sky , at thep222mighty towers . He heard the murmur of the water and then Yves called his name . He turned . Yves stood on the other side of the room , between the two beds , naked . " Which bed do you think is better ? " he asked . And he sounded genuinely perplexed , as though it were a difficult decision . " Whichever you prefer , " Eric said , gravely . Yves pulled back the covers of the bed nearest the window and placed himself between the sheets . He pulled the covers up to his chin and lay on his back , watching Eric . His eyes were dark and enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . And this look , this moment , entered into Eric , to remainwith him forever . There was a terrifying innocence in Yves ' face , a beautiful yielding : in some marvelous way , for Yves , this moment in this bed obliterated , cast into the sea of forgetfulness , all the sordid beds and squalid grappling which had led him here . He was turning to the lover who would not betray him , to his first lover . Eric crossed the room and sat down on the bed and began to undress . Again , he heard the murmur of the stream . " Will you give me a cigarette ? " Yves asked . He had a new voice , newly troubled , and when Eric looked at him he saw for the first time how the face of a lover becomes a stranger 's face . " Bien sur . " He lit two cigarettes and gave one to Yves . They watched each other in the fantastic , tiny glow  --  and smiled , almost like conspirators . Then Eric asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " said Yves . " That 's good , " said Eric , " because I 'm crazy about you . I love you . " Then , in the violent moonlight , naked , he slowly pulled the covers away from Yves . They watched each other and he stared at Yves ' body for a long time before Yves lifted up his arms , with that same sad , cryptic smile , and kissed him . Eric felt beneath his fingers Yves ' slowly stirring , stiffening sex.  |p223This  sex dominated the long landscape of his life as the cathedral towers dominated the plains . Now , Yves , as though he were also remembering that day and night , turned his head and looked at Eric with a wondering , speculative , and triumphant smile . And at that moment , Madame Belet entered , with a sound of knives and forks and plates , and switched on the lights . Yves ' face changed , the sea vanished . Yves rose from the hassock , blinking a little . Madame Belet put the utensils on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning immediately with a bottle of wine , and a corkscrew . She placed these on the table . Yves went to the table and began opening the wine . " She thinks you are going to abandon me , " said Yves . He poured a tiny bit of wine into his own glass , then poured for Eric . He looked at Eric , quickly , and added more wine to the first glass , and set the bottle down . " Abandon you ? " Eric laughed . Yves looked relieved and a little ashamed . " You mean  --  she thinks I 'm running away from you ? " " She thinks that perhaps you do not really intend to bring me to New York . She says that Americans are very different  --  when  --  in their own country . " " Well , how the hell does she know ? " He was suddenly angry . " And it 's none of her fucking business , anyway . " Madame Belet entered , and he glared at her . Imperturbably , she placed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of bread . She re-entered the kitchen , Eric staring malevolently at her straight , chauvinistic back . " If there 's one thing I ca n't stand , it 's malicious old ladies . " They sat down . " She does not really mean any harm , " Yves said . " She thought that she was speaking for my good . " " She thinks it 's good for you to distrust me  --  just when I 'm about to get on a boat ? Does n't she think we have enough to worry about ? " " Oh , well . People do not take the relations between boys seriously , you know that . We will never know many people who believe we love each other . They do not believe therep224can be tears between men . They think we are only playing a game and that we do it to shock them . " Eric was silent , chewing on the raw vegetables which seemed to have no taste . He took a swallow of wine , but it did not help . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know . And it 's going to be worse in New York . " " Oh . well , " said Yves , with an odd and moving note of finality in his voice , " as long as you do not abandon me , I will not be afraid . " Eric smiled  --  at the tone , at the statement ; but he felt his forehead flush hotter , and a strange fear closed his throat . " Is that a promise ? " he asked . He asked it lightly , but his voice sounded stifled ; and Yves , who had lowered his head to his plate , looked up . They watched each other . Eric stared into Yves ' dark eyes , terribly aware of Yves ' forehead , which gleamed like a skull ; and , at the same time , with the most immense desire , he watched Yves ' curving , parted lips . His teeth gleamed . Eric had felt those teeth on his tongue and on his cheek , and those lips had made him moan and tremble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to tremble between them . " Why do n't we pay Madame Belet now ? " Eric asked , " and let her go home ? " Yves rose and walked into the kitchen . Eric munched again on the raw , garlic-flavored vegetables , thinking , This is our last night here . Our last night . Again , he heard their voices in the kitchen , Madame Belet seeming to protest , then agreeing to come in the morning . He finished the last of his wine . Then the kitchen door closed and Yves returned . " I think , perhaps , she is a little angry , " Yves said , smiling , " hut she is gone . She will come again in the morning , especiallyto say good-bye to you . I think that is because she wants to make certain that you know how much she dislikes you . " He did not sit down again , but stood at his end of the table , his hands on his hips . " She says the chicken is ready , we should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric laughed . " I told her it does not matter with chicken , if it is cold or hot ,  |p225I  like it either way . " They both laughed again . Then , abruptly , silence fell between them . Eric rose and crossed to Yves , and they stood for a momentlike two wrestlers , watching each other with a kind of physical calculation , smiling and pale . Yves always seemed , a moment before the act , tentative and tremulous ; not like a girl  --  like a boy : and this strangely innocent waiting , this virile helplessness , always engendered in Eric a positive storm of tenderness . Everything in him , from his heights and depths , his mysterious , hidden source , came rushing together , like a great flood barely channeled in a narrow mountain stream . And it chilled him like that  --  like icy water ; and roared in him like that , and with the menace of things scarcely understood , barely to be controlled ; and he shook with the violence with which he flowed toward Yves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it frightened him . And now he touched Yves lightly and wonderingly on the cheek . Yves ' smile faded , he watched Eric , they moved into each other 's arms . There were the wine bottle and the glasses on the table , their plates , the platter , the bread ; Yves had left a cigarette burning in an ashtray on the table , it was nearly nothing but ash now , long and gray ; and the kitchen light was on . " You say you do n't care about the chicken ? " Eric whispered , laughing . Yves laughed , giving off a whiff of garlic , of peppery sweat . Their arms locked around each other , then they drew apart , and , holding hands , stumbled into the bedroom , into the great haven of their bed . Perhaps it had never before seemed so much like a haven , so much their own , now that the terrible floodwaters of time were about to overtake it . And perhaps they had never before so belonged to each other , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they did now , burning and sobbing on the crying bed . They labored together slowly , violently , a long time : both feared the end . Both feared the morning , when the moon and stars would be gone , when this room would be harsh and sorrowful with sunlight , and this bed would be dismantled , waiting for other flesh . Love is expensive , Yves had once said ,  |p226with  his curiously dry wonder . One must put furniture around it , or it goes . Now , for a while , there would be no furniture  --  how long would this night have to last them ? What would the morning bring ? the imminent morning , behind which were hidden so many mornings , so many nights . And they moaned . Soon , Yves whispered , sounding insistent , like a child , and with a terrible regret . Soon . Eric 's hands and mouth opened and closed on his lover 's body , their bodies strained yet closer together , and Yves ' body shook and he called Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Eric . Eric . Eric . The sound of his breath filled Eric , heavier than the far-off pounding of the sea . Then they were silent , breathing hard . The sound of the sea returned . They were aware of the light in the living room , the light left burning in the kitchen . But they did not move . They remained still in one another 's arms , in their slowly chilling bed . Soon , one of them , it would be Yves , would move , would light two cigarettes . They would lie in bed , smoking , talking and giggling . Then they would shower : what a mess we are ! Yves would cry , laughing a laugh of triumph . Then they would dress , they would probably eat , they would probably go out . And soon the night would end . But , for the moment , they were simply exhausted and at peace with one another and loath to leave the only haven either of them had ever found . And , in fact , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ate no chicken , did no talking , drank no champagne . They fell asleep as they were , cradled , spoon-fashion , against each other , lulled by the pounding of the sea . Eric woke once , when the kitten crawled into bed , trying to place itself around Yves ' neck . But he forced it to the foot of the bed . I Ie turned around , leaning on one elbow , watching Yves ' sleeping face . He thought of getting up and turning off all the lights ; he felt a little hungry . But nothing seemed importantenough to take him out of bed , to take him away from Yves , even for a moment . He lay down again , closing his eyes , and listening to Yves ' breathing . He fell asleep ,  |p227thinking  , Life is very different in New York , and he woke up with this thought , just as the sun was beginning to rise . Yves was awake and was watching him . Eric thought , Maybe he 'll hate New York . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked frightened and determined . They were silent . Yves suddenly pulled Eric into his arms as though he were angry , or as though he were lost . By and by they were at peace again , and then they lay there in silence , blue cigarette smoke circling around them in the sunny air , the kitten purring in the sunlight at their feet . Then the sound of Madame Belet in the kitchen told Eric it was time to make tracks.  |p228Eight  days later , Eric was in New York , with Yves ' last words still ringing in his ears , and his touch and his smell all over his body . And Yves ' eyes , like the searchlight of the Eiffel Tower or the sweep of a lighthouse light , lit up , at intervals , the grave darkness around him and afforded him , in the black distance , his only frame of reference and his only means of navigation . On the last day in Paris , at the last moment , they both suffered from terrible hangovers , having both been up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; their faces were gray and damp ; they stank with weariness . There was great shouting and confusion all around them , and the train breathed over them like some unimaginably malevolent beetle . They were almost too tired for sorrow , but not too tired for fear . It steamed out of them both , like the miasma rising from the Gare St. Lazare . In the deep black shadow of this shed , while their friends stood at a discreet distance from them ; and the station attendant moved up and down the platform , shouting , " En voiture , s'il vous plait ! En voiture ! En voiture ! " ; and the great . hand of the great clock approached the zero hour ; they stared into each other 's faces like comrades who have been through a war.  | " T'ne fait pas , " Eric murmured . " En voiture ! " Eric moved up to stand in the crowded doorway of the train . There was nothing to say ; there was too much to say . " I hate waiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-le suddenlyfelt that he was going to cry , and panic threatened to overtake him because of all these people watching . " We will see each other , " he said , " very soon . I promise you , Yves . I promise you . Tu me fait toujours con fiance , j'espere ? " And he tried to smile . Yves said nothing , but nodded , his eyes very bright , his mouth very vulnerable , his forehead very high , and full of trouble . People were screaming out of windows , were passing last minute items to each other through windows . Eric was the last person standing in the door . He had an awful feeling that he had forgotten something very important . He had paid for Yves ' hotel room , they had visited the American embassy and the French authorities , he had left Yves some money  --  what else ? what else ? The train began to move . Yves looked stunned for a moment , Eric raised his eyes from Yves ' face to say good-bye to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leapt up on the step , holding on with one hand , and kissed Eric hard on the mouth . " Ne m'oublie pas , " he whispered . " You are all I have in this world . " Then he jumped down , just as the train began to pick up speed . He ran along the platform a little longer , then stopped , his hands in his pockets , staring , and with the wind raising his hair . Eric watched him , waving . The platform narrowed , sloped , ended , the train swerved , and Yves vanished from his sight . It did not seem possible and he stared stupidly at the flying poles and wires , at the sign saying PARIS  --  ST . LAZARE , at the blank , back walls of buildings . Then tears rolled down his face . He lit a cigarette and stood in the vestibule , while the hideous outskirts of Paris rolled by . Why am I going home ? he asked himself . But he knew why . It was time . In order notp230to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move forward and risk it all . New York seemed very strange indeed . It might , almost , for strange barbarity of manner and custom , for the sense of danger and horror barely sleeping beneath the rough , gregarioussurface , have been some impenetrably exotic city of the East . So superbly was it in the present that it seemed to have nothing to do with the passage of time : time might have dismissed it as thoroughly as it had dismissed Carthage and Pompeii . It seemed to have no sense whatever of the exigenciesof human life ; it was so familiar and so public that it became , at last , the most despairingly private of cities . One was continually being jostled , yet longed , at the same time , for the sense of others , for a human touch ; and if one was never  --  it was the general complaint  --  left alone in New York , one had , still , to fight very hard in order not to perish of loneliness . This fight , carried on in so many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girls along Fifth Avenue wore their bright clothes like semaphores , trying helplessly to bring to the male attention the news of their mysterious trouble . The men could not read this message . They strode purposefully along , wearing little anonymous hats , or bareheaded , with youthfully parted hair , or crew cuts , accoutered with attache cases , rushing , on the evidence , to the smoking cars of trains . In this haven , they opened up their newspapers and caught up on the day 's bad news . Or they were to be found , as five o'clock fell , in discreetly dim , anonymously appointed bars , uneasy , in brittle , uneasy , female company , pouring down joyless martinis . This note of despair , of buried despair , was insistently . constantly struck . It stalked all the New York avenues , roamed all the New York streets ; was as present in Sutton Place , where the director of Eric 's play lived and the great often gathered , as it was in Greenwich Village , where he had rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to people he had once known well . He could not escape thep231feeling that a kind of plague was raging , though it was officiallyand publicly and privately denied . Even the young seemed blighted  --  seemed most blighted of all . The boys in their blue jeans ran together , scarcely daring to trust one another , but united , like their elders , in a boyish distrust of the girls . Their very walk , a kind of anti-erotic , knee-action lope , was a parody of locomotion and of manhood . They seemed to be shrinking away from any contact with their flamboyantly and paradoxically outlined private parts . They seemed  --  but could it be true ? and how had it happened ?  --  to be at home with , accustomed to , brutality and indifference , and to be terrified of human affection . In some strange way they did not seem to feel that they were worthy of it . Now , late on a Sunday afternoon , having been in New York four days , and not yet having written his parents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way to visit Cass and Richard . He was having a drink with them to celebrate his return . " I 'm glad you think it 's something to celebrate , " he had told Cass over the phone . She laughed . " That 's not very nice . You sound as though you have n't missed us at all . " " Oh , I certainly want to see all of you . But I do n't know if I ever really missed the city very much . Did you ever notice how ugly it is ? " " It 's getting uglier all the time , " Cass said . " A perfect example of free enterprise gone mad . " " I wanted to thank you , " he said , after a moment , " for writing me about Rufus . " And he thought , with a rather surprising and painful venom , Nobody else thought to do it . " Well , I knew , " she said , " that you 'd want to know . " Then there was a silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , I knew he had one . I never met her ; she was just a kid in those days . " " She 's not a kid now , " Cass said . " She 's going to be singingSunday , down in the Village , with some friends of Rufus's.  |p232For  the first time . We promised to bring you along . Vivaldo will be there . " He thought of Rufus . He did not know what to say . " She 's something like her brother , huh ? " " I would n't say that . Yes and no . " Briefly : " You 'll see . " This brought them to another silence , and , after a few seconds , they hung up . He entered their building , stepped into the elevator , and told the elevator man where he was going . He had forgotten the style of American elevator men , but now it came back to him . The elevator man , without a surly word , slammed the elevator gates shut and drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproval of the Silenskis and all their friends and his vivid sense of being as good as they . He rang the bell . Cass opened the door at once , looking as bright as the bright day . " Eric ! " She looked him over with the affectionate mockery he now remembered . " How nice you look with your hair so short ! " " How nice , " he returned , smiling , " you look with yours so long . Or was it always long . It 's that kind of thing a long absence makes you forget . " " Let me look at you . " She pulled him into the apartment and closed the door . " You really look wonderful . Welcomehome . " She leaned forward suddenly and kissed him on the cheek . " Is that the way they do it in Paris ? " " You have to kiss me on both cheeks , " he said , gravely . " Oh . " She seemed slightly embarrassed but kissed him again . " Is that better ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is everybody ? " For the large living room was empty , and filled with the sound of the blues . I t was the voice of a colored woman , the voice of Bessie Smith , and it hurled him , with violence , into the hot center of his past : It 's raining and it 's storming on the sea . I feel like somebody has shipwrecked poor me . For a moment Cass looked as though she were sardonicallyechoing his question . She crossed the room andp233lowered the volume of the music slightly . " The children are over in the park with some friends of theirs . Richard 's in his study , working . But they should all be appearing almost any moment now . " " Oh , " he said , " then I 'm early . I 'm sorry . " " You are n't early , you 're on time . And I 'm glad . I was hoping to have a chance to talk to you alone before we go down to this jam session . " " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Cass went over to the bar , and he threw himself down on the sofa . " It 's mighty nice and cool in here . It 's awful outside . I 'd forgotten how hot New York could be . " The large windows were open and the water stretched beyond the windows , very bright and peaceful , but murkier than the Mediterranean . The breeze that filled the room came directly from the water ; seemed , almost , to bring with it the spice and stink of Europe and the murmur of Yves ' voice . Eric leaned back , held in a kind of peaceful melancholy , comforted by the beat of Bessie 's song , and looked over at Cass . The sun surrounded her golden hair which was piled on top of her head and fell over her brow in girlish , somewhattoo artless and incongruous curls . This was meant to soften a face , the principal quality of which had always been a spare , fragile boniness . There was a fine crisscross of wrinkles now around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a little too much make-up . This , and something indefinably sorrowful in the line of her mouth and jaw , as she stood silently at the bar , looking down , made Eric feel that Cass was beginning to fade , to become brittle . Something icy had touched her . " Do you want gin or vodka or bourbon or Scotch or beer ? or tequila ? " She looked up , smiling . Though the smile was genuine , it was weary . It did not contain the mischievous delight that he remembered . And there were tiny lines now around her neck , which he had never noticed before . We 're getting old , he thought , and it damn sure did n't take long.  | " I think I 'd better stick to whiskey . I get too drunk too fast on gin  --  and I do n't know what this evening holds . " " Ah , " she said , " farsighted Eric ! And what kind of whiskey ? " " In Paris , when we order whiskey  --  which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do  --  we always mean Scotch . " " You loved Paris , did n't you ? You must have , you were gone so long . Tell me about it . " She made two drinks and came and sat beside him . From far away , he heard the muffled cling ! of a typewriter bell . It 's a long old road , Bessie sang , but I 'm going to find an end . " It does n't seem so long , " he said , " now that I 'm back . " He felt very shy now , for when Cass said You loved Paris he at once thought , Yves is there . " It 's a great city , Paris , a beautiful city  --  and  --  it was very good for me . " " I see that . You seem much happier . There 's a kind of light around you . " She said this very directly , with a rueful , conspiratorial smile : as though she knew the cause of his happiness , and rejoicedfor him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's just the sun , " he said , and they both laughed . Then , irrepressibly , " I was very happy there , though . " " Well , you did n't leave because you were n't happy there any more ? " " No . " And when I get there , I 'm going to shake hands with a friend . " A guy I know who thinks he has great psychic powers "  --  he sipped his whiskey , smilinb  --  " Frenchman , persuadedme that I 'd become a great star if I came home and did this play . And I just have n't got the guts to go against the stars , to say nothing of arguing with a Frenchman . So . " She laughed . " I did n't know the French went in for things like that . I thought they were very logical . " " French logic is very simple . Whatever the French do is logical because the French are doing it . That 's the really unbeatableadvantage French logic has over all others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed again . " I hope you read the play before your friend consulted the stars . Is it a good part ? " " It 's the best part , " he said , after a moment , " that I 've ever had . " Again , briefly , he heard the typewriter bell . Cass lit a cigarette , offered one to Eric , and lit it for him . " Are you going to settle here now , or are you planning to go back , or what ? " " I do n't , " he said , quickly , " have any plans for going back , a lot  --  maybe everything  --  depends on what happens with this play . " She sensed his retreat , and took her tone from him . " Oh . I 'd love to come and watch rehearsals . I 'd run out and get coffee for you , and things like that . It would make me feel that I 'd contributed to your triumph . " " Because you 're sure it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wonderful Cass . I guess it 's a habit great men 's wives get into . " Weeping and crying , tears falling on the ground . The atmosphere between them stiffened a little , nevertheless , with their knowledge of why he had allowed his career in New York to lapse for so long . Then he allowed himself to think of opening night , and he thought , Yves will be here . This thought exalted him and made him feel safe . He did not feel safe now , sitting here alone with Cass ; he had not felt safe since stepping off the boat . His ears ached for the sound of Yves ' footfalls beside him : until he heard this rhythm , all other sounds were meaningless . Weeping and crying , tears falling on the ground . All other faces were obliterated for him by the blinding glare of Yves ' absence . He looked over at Cass , longing to tell her about Yves , but not daring , not knowing how to begin . " Great men 's wives , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explode that literary myth . " She looked at him , gravely sippingher whiskey , without seeming to taste it . When I got top236the end , I was so worried down . " You seem very sure of yourself , " she said . " I do ? " He was profoundly astonished and pleased . " I do n't feel very sure of myself . " " I remember you before you went away . You were miserablethen . We all wondered  --  I wondered  --  what would becomeof you . But you are n't miserable now . " " No , " he said , and , under her scrutiny , blushed . " I 'm not miserable any more . But I still do n't know what 's going to become of me . " " Growth , " she said , " is what will become of you . It 's what has become of you . " And she gave him again her oddly intimate , rueful smile . " It 's very nice to see , it 's very  --  enviable . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself envying anyone for a long , long time . " " It 's mighty funny , " he said , " that you should envy me . " He rose from the sofa , and walked to the window . Behind him , beneath the mighty lament of the music , a heavy silence gathered : Cass , also , had something to talk about , but he did not want to know what it was . You ca n't trust nobody , you might as well be alone . Staring out over the water , he asked , " What was Rufus like  --  near the end ? " After a moment , he turned and looked at her . " I had n't meant to ask you that  --  but I guess I really want to know . " Her face , despite the softening bangs , grew spare and contemplative . Her lips twisted . " I told you a little of it , " she said , " in my letter . But I did n't know how you felt by that time and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out her cigarette and lit another one . " He was very unhappy , as  --  as you know . " She paused . " Actually , we never got very close to him . Vivaldo knew him better than  --  than we did , anyway . " He felt a curious throb of jealousy : Vivaldo ! " We did n't see much of him . He became very involved with a Southern girl , a girl from Georgia Found my long lost friend , and I might as well stayed at home ! " You did n't tell me that , " he said.  | " No . He was n't very nice to her . He beat her up a lot He stared at her , feeling himself grow pale , remembering more than he wanted to remember , feeling his hope and his hope of safety threatened by invincible , unnamed forces within himself . He remembered Rufus ' face , his hands , his body , and his voice , and the constant humiliation . " Beat her up ? What for ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she was white . I do n't know . Because he was Rufus . It was very ugly . She was a nice girl , maybe a little pathetic  --  " " Did she like to be beaten up ? I mean  --  did something in her like it , did she like to be  --  debased ? " " No , I do n't think so . I really do n't think so . Well , maybe there 's something in everybody that likes to be debased , but I do n't think life 's that simple . I do n't trust all these formulas . " She paused . " To tell the truth , I think she probably loved Rufus , really loved him , and wanted Rufus to love her . " " How abnormal , " he said , " can you get ! " He finished his drink . A very faint , wry amusement crossed her face . " Anyway , their affair dragged on from bad to worse and she was finally committed to an institution " You mean , a madhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the South . Her family came and got her . " " My God , " he said . " Go on . " " Well , then , Rufus disappeared  --  for quite a long time , that 's when I met his sister , she came to see us , looking for him  --  and came back once , and  --  died . " Helplessly , she opened one bony hand , then closed it into a fist . Eric turned back to the window . " A Southern girl , " he said . He felt a very dull , very distant pain . It all seemed very long ago , that gasping and trembling , freezing and burning time . The pain was distant now because it had scarcely beenp239bearable then . It could not really be recollected because it had become a part of him . Yet , the power of this pain , though diminished , was not dead : Rufus ' face again appeared before him , that dark face , with those dark eyes and curving , heavy lips . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love on Eric . Then , out of hiding , leapt his other faces , the crafty , cajoling face of desire , the remote face of desire achieved . Then , for a second , he saw Rufus ' face as he stared on death , and saw his body hurtling downward through the air : into that water , the water which stretched before him now . The old pain receded into the home it had made in him . But another pain , homeless as yet , began knocking at his heart  --  not for the first time : it would force an entry one day , and remain with him forever . Catch them . Do n't let them blues in here . They shakes me in my bed , ca n't sit down in my chair . " Let me fix you a fresh drink , " Cass said . " Okay . " She took his glass . As she walked to the bar , he said , " You knew about us , I guess ? I guess everybody knew  --  though we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , he always had a lot of girls around . " " Well , so did you , " she said . " In fact , I vaguely remember that you were thinking of getting married at one point . " He took his drink from the bar , and paced the room . " Yes . I have n't thought of her in a long time , either . " He paused and grimaced sourly . " That 's right , I certainly did have a few girls hanging around . I hardly even remember their names . " As he said this , the names of two or three old girl friends flashed into his mind . " I have n't thought about them for years . " He came back to the sofa , and sat down . Cass watched him from the bar . " I might , " he said , painfully , " have had them around just on account of Rufus  --  trying to prove something , maybe , to him and to myself . " The room was growing darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the go . They runs around my house , in and out of my front door . Then the needle scratched aimlessly for a second , and the record player clicked itself off . Eric 's attentionhad painfully snagged itself on the memory of thoseANOTHER COUNTRY 239unloved , but not wholly undesired , girls . Their texture and their odor floated back to him : and it was abruptly astonishingthat he had not thought of that side of himself for so long . It had been because of Yves . This thought filled him with a hideous , unwilling resentment : he remembered Yves ' hostile adventures with the girls of the Latin Quarter and St. Germain-des-Pres . These adventures had not touched Eric because they so clearly had not touched Yves . But now , superbly , like a diver coming to the surface , his terror bobbed , naked , to the surface of his mind : he would lose Yves , here . It would happen here . And he , he would have no woman , and he would have no Yves . His flesh began to itch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at Cass , who had moved to the sofa , and sat very still beside him in the gloom . She was not watching him . She sat with her hands folded in her lap , busy with thoughts of her own . " This is one hell of a party , " he said . She rose , smiling , and shook herself a little . " It is , is n't it ? I was beginning to wonder where the children are  --  they should be home by now . And maybe I 'd better turn on some lights . " She switched on a lamp near the bar . Now , the water and the lights along the water glowed more softly , suggesting the imminent night . Everything was pearl gray , shot with gold . " I 'd better go and rouse Richard . " " I did n't know , " he said , " that it would be so easy to feel at home again . " She looked at him quickly , and grinned . " Is that good ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something more , something about Yves , but he heard Richard 's study door open and close . He turned to face Richard as he came into the room ; he looked very handsome and boyish and big . " So we finally got you back here ! I 'm told it took every penny Shubert Alley could scrape together . How are you , you old bastard ? " " I 'm fine , Richard , it 's good to see you . " They clung together , briefly , in the oddly truncated , shrinking , Americanp240embrace , and stepped back to look at one another . " I hear that you 're selling more books than Frank Yerby . " " Better , " said Richard , " but not more . " He looked over at Cass . " How are you , chicken ? How 's the headache ? " " Eric started telling me about Paris , and I forgot all about it . Why do n't we go to Paris ? I think it would do wondersfor us . " " Do wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let this lousy ex-expatriate come here and turn your head . " He walked over to the bar and poured himself a drink . " Did you leave many broken hearts over there ? " " They were very restrained about it . Those centuries of breeding mean something , you know . " " That 's what they kept telling me when I was over there . It did n't seem to mean much , though , beyond poverty and corruption and disease . How did you find it ? " " I had a ball . I loved it . Of course , I was n't in the Army  --  " " Did you like the French ? I could n't stand them ; I thought they were as ugly and as phony as they come . " " I did n't feel that . They can be pretty damn exasperating  --  but , hell , I liked them . " " Well . Of course , you 're a far more patient sort than I 've ever been . " He grinned . " How 's your French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But fluent . " " You learn it in bed ? " He blushed . Richard watched him and laughed . " Yes . As a matter of fact . " Richard carried his drink to the sofa and sat down . " I can see that traveling has n't improved your morals any . You going to be around awhile ? " Eric sat down in the armchair across the room from Richard . " Well , I 've got to be here at least until the play opens . But after that  --  who knows ? " " Well , " said Richard , and raised his glass , " here 's hoping . May it run longer than Tobacco Road . " Eric shuddered . " Not with me in it , bud . " He drank , hep241lit a cigarette ; a certain familiar fear and anger began to stir in him . " Tell me about yourself , bring me up to date . " But , as he said this , he realized that he did not care what Richard had been doing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wondered if he had always felt this way . Perhaps he had never been able to admit it to himself . Perhaps Richard had changed  --  but did people change ? He wondered what he would think of Richard if he were meeting him for the first time . Then he wondered what Yves would think of these people and what these people would think of Yves . " There is n't much to tell . You know about the book  --  I 'll get a copy for you , a coming-home present  --  " " That should make you glad you 've returned , " said Cass . Richard looked at her , smiling . " No sabotage , please . " He said to Eric , " Cass still likes to make fun of me . " Then , " There 's a new book coming , Hollywood may buy the first one , I 've got a TV thing coming up . " " Anything for me in the TV bit ? " " It 's cast . Sorry . We probably could n't have afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to answer it . There was suddenly a tremendous commotion at the door , sobbing and screaming , but Eric did not react until he saw the change in Richard 's face , and heard Cass ' cry . Then Richard and Eric stood up and the children came pounding into the room . Michael was sobbing and blood dripped from his nose and mouth onto his red-and-white-striped T-shirt . Paul was behind him , pale and silent , with blood on his knuckles and smeared across his face ; and his white shirt was torn . " It 's all right , Cass , " Richard said , quickly , " it 's all right . They 're not dead . " Michael ran to his father and buried his bloody face in his father 's belly . Richard looked at Paul . " What the hell 's been going on ? " Cass pulled Michael away and looked into his face . " Come on , baby , let me wash this blood away and see what'sp242happened to you . " Michael turned to her , still sobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come on , darling , everything 's all right , hush now , darling , come on . " Michael was led away , his hand in Cass ' trembling hand , and Richard looked briefly at Eric , over Paul 's head . " Come on , " he said to Paul , " what happened ? You get into a fight or did you beat him up , or what ? " Paul sat down , pressing his hands together . " I do n't really know what happened . " He was on the edge of tears himself ; his father waited . " We had been playing ball and then we were getting ready to come home , we were n't doing anything , just fooling around and walking . I was n't paying much attention to Mike , he was behind me with some friends of his . Then "  --  he looked at his father  --  " some colored  --  colored boys , they came over this hill and they yelled something , I could n't hear what they yelled . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started beating up the little kids and we came running down to stop them . " He looked at his father again . " We never saw any of them before , I do n't know where they came from . One of them had Mike down on the ground , and was punching him , but I got him off . " He looked at his bloody fist . " I think I knocked a couple teeth down his throat . " " Good for you . You did n't get hurt yourself ? How do you feel ? " " I feel all right . " But he shuddered . " Stand up , come over here , let me look at you . " Paul stood up and walked over to his father , who knelt down and stared into his face , prodding him gently in the belly and the chest , stroking his neck and his face . " You got a pretty bad crack in the jaw , did n't you ? " " Mike 's hurt worse than I am . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gathered his son into his arms . " Do n't cry , Paul , it 's all over now . " But Paul could not stop , now that he had begun . " Why would they want to do a thing like that , Daddy ? We never even saw them before ! "  | " Sometimes  --  sometimes the world is like that , Paul . You just have to watch out for people like that . " " Is it because they 're colored and we 're white ? Is that why ? " Again , Richard and Eric looked at each other . Richard swallowed . " The world is full of all kinds of people , and sometimes they do terrible things to each other , but  --  that 's not why . " " Some colored people are very nice , " said Eric , " and some are not so nice  --  like white people . Some are nice and some are terrible . " But he did not sound very convincing and he wished he had held his peace . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , " Richard said , " and , frankly , I 'm willing to cry Uncle and surrender the island back to the goddam Indians . I do n't think that they ever intended that we should be happy here . " He gave a small , dry laugh , and turned his attention to Paul again . " Would you recognize any of these boys if you saw them again ? " " I think so , " Paul said . He caught his breath and dried his eyes . " I know I 'd recognize one of them , the one I hit . When the blood came out of his nose and his mouth , it looked so  --  ugly  --  against his skin . " Richard watched him a moment . " Let 's go inside and clean up and see what 's happening to old Michael . " " Michael ca n't fight , " Paul said , " you know ? And kids are always going to be picking on him . " " Well , we 're going to have to do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He walked to the door , with his arm on Paul 's shoulder . He turned to Eric . " Make yourself at home , will you ? We 'll be back in a few minutes . " And he and Paul left the room . Eric listened to the voices of the children and their parents , racing , indistinct , bewildered . " All kids get into fights , " said Richard , " let 's not make a big thing out of it . " " They did n't really get into a fight , " Cass said . " They were attacked . That 's not the same thing at all , it seems to me. "  | " Cass , let 's not make it any worse than it is . " " I still think we ought to call the doctor ; we do n't know anything about the human body , how do we know there is n't something broken or bleeding inside ? It happens all the time , people dropping dead two days after an accident . " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scare them to death ? " " I am not hysterical and you stop being the Rock of Gibraltar . I 'm not part of your public , I know you ! " " Now , what does that mean ? " " Nothing . Nothing . Will you please call the doctor ? " Michael 's voice broke in , high and breaking , with a child 's terror . " Why , that 's the silliest thing I ever heard , " Cass said , in another tone and with great authority ; " of course no one 's going to come in here while you 're asleep . Mama and Daddy are here and so is Paul . " Michael 's voice interrupted her again . " It 's all right , we are n't going out , " Cass said . " We are n't going out tonight , " Richard said , " and Paul and I are going to teach you some tricks so kids wo n't be bothering you any more . By the time we get through , those guys will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy , they 'll take off in a cloud of dust . " He heard Michael 's unsteady laugh . Then he heard the sound of the phone being dialed , and Richard 's voice , and the small ring of the phone as Richard hung up . " I guess we wo n't be going downtown with you , after all , " Richard said , coming back into the room . " I 'm sorry . I 'm sure they 're all right but Cass wants the doctor to look at them and we have to wait for him to get here . Anyway , I do n't think we should leave them alone tonight . " He took Eric 's glass from his hand . " Let me spike this for you . " He walked over to the bar ; he was not as calm as he pretended to be . " Little black bastards , " he muttered , " they could have killed the kid . Why the hell ca n't they take it out on each other , for Christ 's sake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  they loosened one of his teeth and bloodied his nose  --  but , mainly , they scared the shit out of him . Thank God Paul was with him . " Then he was silent . " I do n't know . This whole neighborhood , this whole city 's gone to hell . Ip245keep telling Cass we ought to move  --  but she does n't want to . Maybe this will help her change her mind . " " Change my mind about what ? " Cass asked . She strode to the low table before the sofa , picked up her cigarettes , and lit one . " Moving out of town , " Richard said . He watched her as he spoke and spoke too quietly , as though he were holding himself in . " I 've no objection to moving . We just have n't been able to agree on where to move . " " We have n't agreed on where to move because all you 've done is offer objections to every place I suggest . And , since you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to move . " " Oh , Richard . I simply am not terribly attracted to any of those literary colonies you want us to become a part of Richard 's eyes turned as dark as deep water . " Cass does n't like writers , " he said , lightly , to Eric , " not if they make a living at it , anyway . She thinks writers should never cease starving and whoring around , like our good friend , Vivaldo . That 's fine , boy , that 's really being responsible and artistic . But all the rest of us , trying to love a woman and raise a family and make some loot  --  we 're whores . " She was very pale . " I have never said anything at all like that . " " No ? There are lots of ways of saying "  --  he mimicked her  --  " things like that . You 've said it a thousand times . You must think I 'm dumb , chicken . " Ile turned again to Eric , who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " If she was stuck with a guy like Vivaldo  --  " " Leave Vivaldo out of this ! What has he got to do with it ? " Richard gave a surprisingly merry laugh , and repeated , " If she was stuck with a guy like that , maybe you would n't hear some pissing and moaning ! Oh , what a martyrdom ! And how she 'd love it ! " He took a swallow of his drink and crossed the room toward her . " And you know why ? You want to knowp246why ? " There was a silence . She lifted her enormous eyes to meet his . " Because you 're just like all the other American cunts . You want a guy you can feel sorry for , you love him as long as he 's helpless . Then you can pitch in , as you love to say , you can be his helper . Helper ! " He threw back his head and laughed . " Then , one fine day , the guy feels chilly between his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's helped herself to them and locked them in the linen closet . " He finished his drink and , roughly , caught his breath . His voice changed , becoming almost tender with sorrow . " That 's the way it is , is n't it , sugar ? You do n't like me now as well as you did once . " She looked terribly weary ; her skin seemed to have loosened . She put one hand lightly on his arm . " No , " she said , " that 's not the way it is . " Then a kind of fury shook her and tears came to her eyes . " You have n't any right to say such things to me ; you 're blaming me for something I have n't anything to do with at all ! " He reached out to touch her shoulder ; she moved away . " You 'd better go , Eric , this ca n't be much fun for you . Make our excuses , please , to Vivaldo and Ida . " " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having their Sunday fight , " said Richard ; his face very white , breathing hard , staring at Cass . Eric set his drink down , carefully ; he wanted to run . " I 'll just say you had to stay in on account of the kids . " " Tell Vivaldo to take it as a warning . This is what ha ppensif you have kids , this is what happens if you get what you want . " And , for a moment , he looked utterly baffled and juvenile . Then , " Hell , I 'm sorry , Eric . We never meant to submit you to such a melodramatic afternoon . Please come and see us again ; we do n't do this all the time , we really do n't . I 'll walk you to the door . " " It 's all right , " Eric said . " I 'm a big boy , I understand . " He walked over to Cass and they shook hands . " It was nice seeing you . " " It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
