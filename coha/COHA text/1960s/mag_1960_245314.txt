Room 455 at Hoover High School in Glendale , Calif , contains a red-tailed hawk that eats horsemeat , a sinister 8-ft. anaconda , hordes of white rats , a map of every ant colony in the vicinity and George Cassell , 28 , an exuberant young man who grew up at the foot of Mt . Shasta with a trout rod in his hand , football on his mind and no thought of study . As it turned , out , he was destined to make Room 455 just about the most popular teen-age hangout in Glendale . Since he teaches biology-one of the deadlier subjects in U.S. high schools-this is going some . <P> The cause of Hoover High 's good fortune is the head injury that George Cassell got while playing football at the University of California at Los Angeles . He lost his fullback 's job and his athletic scholarship , transferred to a state college - and discovered the joys of learning . <P> Two years ago . he began teaching at Hoover High , which then had a clutch of reluctant biology students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted live students . Every weekend , he took his students into the desert and mountains to camp , trap and study . Entire classes soon went along at their own expense . Cassell 's students began winning top rank at science fairs for inventing insecticides , studying cholesterol and other such matters . <P> <P> This year Hoover High has nine biology classes . <P> Last spring Teacher Cassell sent 21 sophomores out to survey Glendale on the premise that " a community is composed of a group of organisms living together in dynamic equilibrium with the environment . " They discovered that the chaparral on the nearby Verdugo Mountains is all that keeps Glendale from being washed away by flood . Studying plants , they found those that best sustain this growth , e.g. , black mustard . They analyzed the city water supply , found it pure but dwindling . Armed with petri dishes , they made bacteria counts in restaurants , groceries , the city jail , restrooms and hospitals . They measured noise , nutrition , recreation , garbage disposal-literally everything that helps or hinders man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tells more about Glendale than Glendale has ever known about itself . The city council wanted copies . " We 're very proud of you , " Councilwoman Zelma Bogue , onetime Glendale mayor , told Cassell . Proud as he was too , Teacher Cassell noted that his students " just barely scratched the surface . "
