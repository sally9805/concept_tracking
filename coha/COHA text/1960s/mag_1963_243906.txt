For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart ; yea , the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me , and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads . <P> - Doctrine &; Covenants , 25:12 <P> During the long and uncertain trek westward over the plains in 1847 , Brigham Young 's Mormon pioneers obeyed this admonition , never beginning a day without a song or meeting the night without a hymn of thanks . So ingrained did the joyful habit of singing become that Young founded a choir at journey 's end . This week the Mormon Tabernacle Choir , having long since won world renown , starts its 35th year of radio broadcasting-the longest sustained network program in history . <P> It was in 1867 that the Salt Lake colony finished its famous 8,000-seat tabernacle , built to house the choir 's sound of worshipful music . The tabernacle was and is an acoustical masterpiece , in which one can hear a pin drop 250 ft. away . The choir grew to fit the building and to become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latter-day Saints ever had . Beginning in 1929 , " Sunday after Sunday the half-hour radio show known as Music and the Spoken Word from the Crossroads of the West reshaped the world 's image of Mormonism . <P> Polyphony , Not Polygamy . The program and the choir were never-and are not-intended to proselytize . In fact , the word Mormon is mentioned only twice in each show , and then only in the name of the choir . " The aim of the broadcasts was and is intended to achieve a universality , " says Apostle Richard L. Evans , who for 33 years has supplied the spoken word . His sermonettes heard with the choir contain no doctrine of the Latter-day Saints , in stead deal with Christian ethics . " Do n't let life discourage you ; everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was , " he may say . Or , " There is no way of avoiding the moral consequences of a dishonest , unethical or immoral act . " <P> The choir sings Mormon hymns no more often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKay called the choir 's general effect " inestimable " in helping 13,000 Mormon missionaries over the world bring in multitudes of converts ( 100,000 last year ) to a church once only known and derided for its long-banned polygamy . " The choir makes friends and opens doors , " says Richard Condie , 65 , choirmaster since 1957 and a professor of music at the University of Utah . He directs 375 singers , divided into four-part men 's and four-part women 's choruses . All members are adult volunteers , including many housewives , but also four doctors , three lawyers , two bankers and one dentist-plus a glass blower and a hog caller . <P> Uncanned Covenant . The choir has never been better . When Condie took over , he auditioned everyone in it and let 75 go at once . " It was n't a pleasant thing to do , " he says . Now there are auditions at least every two years . Rehearsals are held only two hours a week , but the choir never actually rehearses the entire radio program as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , and corrects flaws next time around .
