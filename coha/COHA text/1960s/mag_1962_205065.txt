For nearly a decade , the men who run the nation 's railroads have been battling doggedly to eliminate the union-imposed " featherbedding " that the railroads claim costs them an unnecessary $500 million a year . Most of the time , it has seemed a losing fight . Last week in Washington the tide unexpectedly turned when a presidential arbitration commission decided that the Order of Railroad Telegraphers was unjustified in demanding the right to veto job cutbacks on the Chicago &; North Western Railway . <P> Last week 's ruling was the work of Sylvester Garrett , 50 , a Pittsburgh lawyer who earned his reputation as an arbitrator in steel industry disputes and was appointed three weeks ago by President Kennedy to end a month-long telegraphers ' strike against the C. &; N.W. ( The other two members of the arbitration board-C . &; N.W. Chairman Ben Heineman and Telegraphers ' President George Leighty-canceled each other out . ) The essence of Garrett 's decision was that al though the C. &; N.W. must discuss proposed layoffs with the union , the final decision would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the union , the railroad agreed to give the union 90 days ' notice of firings and to pay discharged telegraphers 60% of their annual earnings for as long as five years . <P> The decision will have little immediate impact at the C. &; N.W. , where tough-minded Ben Heineman , who has already eliminated 600 telegraphers , plans to keep on all but 70 of the remaining 1,000 anyway . But in the long run it marked a stunning setback for the telegraphers . A year ago , Leighty 's union extracted from the giant Southern Pacific a virtual guarantee to keep on all its telegraphers until their death or retirement and , with that encouragement , the telegraphers have since demanded a veto over job cutbacks on 33 other railroads . Now Garrett 's decision rather than the S.P. settlement will almost certainly serve as the precedent in future negotiations between the railroads and the telegraphers . More important yet , last week 's ruling will weaken the hand of all rail unions in their fight to defy the recommendations of the presidential board , which last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other unneeded workers on U.S. railroads.
