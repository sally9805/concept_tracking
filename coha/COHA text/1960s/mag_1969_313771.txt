Among the fruits of this year 's campus disorders is a harvest of state laws that student activists might well ponder this summer . Reflecting majority disapproval across the country , the laws will make campus protest far riskier next fall . Some disruptive tactics , in fact , are now legally denned as felonies , with penalties of up to five and even ten years in prison . <P> In California , the state legislature is digging out from a blizzard of 100 bills , many of them originally introduced for political mileage rather then passage . A legislative committee has winnowed those bills to twelve proposed laws and resolutions . If enacted , as expected , the measures will make it a misdemeanor to disturb the peace of any campus , command additional campus disciplinary action against convicted students , cancel their state financial aid for two years , and require all public campuses to develop specific codes of student behavior . New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller has vetoed three stringent bills as " premature , " including one that would have taken away disrupters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three other bills that outlaw unauthorized firearms on campus , require new codes of campus behavior , and create a state commission to study the causes of college unrest . <P> According to a 50-state survey , conducted for TIME by the National Education Association , most legislatures have ignored the reasons for student protest in favor of simply halting it . At least eleven states have passed new laws aimed at curbing campus disruptions , although not all the bills have yet been signed by the respective Governors . These states are Arkansas , Colorado , Idaho , Iowa , Minnesota , Nevada , Oklahoma , Tennessee , Texas , Wisconsin and South Carolina , where the bill provides for the immediate expulsion of disrupters after a hearing . Oklahoma 's law ( now signed ) specifies that persons convicted of inciting riots can be imprisoned for ten years . <P> Several states have passed laws aimed at keeping nonstudent agitators off campus . The legislatures of Colorado , Oklahoma , Maryland and Tennessee have approved bills that apply private trespass rules to public campuses , or otherwise control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felony for nonstudents to enter school property " to incite , participate in , aid or assist a riot . " Possible penalty : five years in the state penitentiary . <P> Rules for Riots . Tactics in other states range from mere admonition to measures of sharp severity . Indiana 's legislature passed no new laws , but Governor Edgar D. Whitcomb officially reminded trustees in the state university system that they may be replaced if they do not back up the Governor 's " respectful demand " for absolute compliance with existing laws .
