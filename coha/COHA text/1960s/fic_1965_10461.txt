" Anything within reason . " " He 's already starting to welsh on it , Moses . " " You just name it , " I say , looking her dead in the eye . She puts her finger to the side of her head and rolls her eyes . " I 'm thinking , " she says . " You think all you want to . The offer stands . " " I imagine , if I was to put my mind to it , I might be able to think of something . " " Please , Miss Miami . " How low does a guy have to stoop ? What does a fella have to do ? " Say pretty please , ' " she says . " Pretty please . . . . " Now they are both laughing . The two of them laughing on both sides of me . I think I will turn around and bust Moses right in the big middle of his fat face ... . Only I 'm not going to get a chance to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he hollers . " Damn you straight to hell ! How do you expect me to get any sleep around here ? " He 's barefooted , got on nothing but his jockey undershorts and he 's got a whiskey bottle in his hand , shaking it like a club . So now we wait . Miami stands by the car . I sit and sweat . The sun is getting high now , bright and hot , and I 'm one of those people who sweats . Cartwright sits . He licks his lips and blinks . I know that we must not ever , ever , ever hold a human beingp21responsible for his height and weight , the conformation of his eyes and the tilt and shape of his jaw . And I know that nobody , not even an actor , can be sure that the expression on his face equals exactly the feeling he intends to express . Maybe a woman , a really beautiful woman . Maybe almost any woman , because , even though they like to be flattered and can be , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are supreme realists , living easy with illusions , yet able to live without them and seldom duped or victimized by them , not haunted the way we are . For the longesttime , a gray waste of time it is shameful even to think of , I woke each morning and faced my mirror with the very real and burning hope that looking back at me would be a young , handsomestranger , someone with the shine of health , whose blood was money , whose energy was boundless and depthless and on . whom Lady Luck looked with benevolent bright eyes . And never once was that stranger there . Instead a familiar friend I loved and hated . Oh , what a time it was , what a bitter time it was before I learned ( making a virtue of necessity , a bookish man would say ) to live with him . He was there , always to be cared for and comforted , fed sugar sometimes and spanked at others . An ugly , shambling pet whose hungers were infinite and whose language was a fugue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave me and would finally ( the last and best laugh ) die , draggingme into the dark with him , I had better accept him first and try to master him or use him . And I have done the best that I can ( with of course occasional deplorable but inevitable lapses into such folly as self-pity ) . So now , in the game of multiplying and dividing that is our only union with another soul , the one step edge in the terrible footrace of survival , I know anyway what the thing another looks at , the thing called Moses looks like . I wear my face like a mask , knowing , triumphant , if knowing a fact can be called a triumph , that what I am will never really be read by any man ( and I will only read a little like a man newly blind learning braille ) . Nor will I ever read into the heart of any other human being .

I am a wedding , a continual copulation of spirit and flesh , of monster and man , beauty and the beast . I should have been a woman . I should have been heavybreasted , broad-hipped with a brood of children in shrill circles around my feet . So I will not blame Cartwright for any of it , even now as , without knowing it , he vigorously picks his nose . CartwrightThere is n't nothing a fella can say when Red is like this . You sit there and wait . Red takes a long drink out of that bottle , like he was drinking a Pepsi or something . He can drink whiskey all right , but nobody can drink like that without some kind of trouble . And here it comes now . He wipes the back of his hand across his mouth .

" " Now , honey , " he says . " You would n't want me to stand outp23here in broad daylight in the sight of God and man and tell a lie would you ? " I ca n't help laughing a little bit . I mean , you can fight it , but sometimes even then it gets away from you . He turns on me . " What was the topic of your conversation ? " " Nothing . I done told you , nothing at all . " " Well , then , do n't mind me . Do n't pay any attention to me . I 'll stand here and you all keep right on with the conversation , huh ? " You could n't cut the silence with a meat cleaver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to myself what 's the use ? but here goes . " Going to be a hot one , Miss Miami , do n't you think ? " " Yes , " Moses says , " I 'd say it was warm even for this time ofthe year . " " Is that what you want me to talk to him about ? " Miami says . " The weather ? " I could kill her . I could stake her out like the Apaches do in the movies . " Hey ! That 's a good idea , " Red says . " What is ? " " Talking about the weather . It 's always interesting . The main thing is that there is some always . Can you imagine , can you picture no weather at all ? " " No , sir , I ca n't . " " Tell me all about weather , Cartwright . Tell me about the seasons of the year . " " Aw , Red , quit kidding around . " " Tell me about it ! " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from Tennessee , do n't you ? " he says .

" " It 's a mighty pretty time of the year . "  | " Is that the only word you can come up with ? Tell how it is up there in the mountains after a long , long , hard winter , a winterof gray sky and iron cold . Tell how the air all of a sudden one morning turns all sweet and fresh like milk . How the little wild flowers drip with sweet honey and drive the bees drunk and crazy . And the birds .

" Cooking up mischief . That 's what you 're doing . " " No , sir , " I say . " You know us better than that . " " Maybe , " he says . " Maybe you 're planning to sneak off with all the money and leave me asleep in the trailer . Leave me here all alone , not a dime to my name or a friend in the world . Leave me here to rot and die for all you care , stranded in . . . stranded in . . . Where in the hell are we ? " " High Pines , Red , " Moses says , coming in just in time to get the credit . Red grunts and looks across the big empty field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Red , " I say , " a real nice place . " " Parked out in the middle of an empty field near a place called High Pines , " Red says , almost to himself , like he could n't quite believe it and wanted to convince hiself . " This here 's the Fairgrounds , " I say . " See that big old arch over yonder ? This is where everything happens . " " Do n't look like they had a fair around here for a long time , " he says , looking at the scrubby grass and weeds , spitting in the dust by his feet.  | " That 's the whole thing , " I say . " They 'll all be here . Everybodyand his brother 's coming to hear you preach . " " We ought a be in Galveston , " he says . " We 'll be there pretty soon , " Moses says . " Yeah , Red , " I say .

" " What the hell do you think , you anemic hookworm ? I 'm looking right at you . " " I already done told you . As soon as we get enough money . " " Money ! " he says . " Seems like we always got money troubles . Never quite got enough . I wonder where it all goes to ? " Which is what I 'm wondering myself . There ought a be a real pile this time , enough to make the whole thing worthwhile . But there 's something about making jokes about money I just ca n't tolerate . Some people will joke about anything , especially when they 're not worried . Well , I got news for all of them . They 're going to have to get up early and move quick to beat me out of mine . He looks at me and laughs . Laughing , he tilts the bottle up high and drains the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . He stands looking at it sail and fall like he is proud how far he can chunk a empty whiskey bottle . " Miami , " he says , " bestir yourself and get me another bottle . " She do n't change the look on her face . She do n't hesitate . She 's already gone to the trailer to get it for him . " Look at you ! " he says to me and Moses . " A fine couple of managers I got , a fine pair ! A fat Yankee and a ignorant ridgerunnerthat ai n't got sense enough to come in out of the rain . Here I am all wore out , worn down to a nub , dead on my feet , weary , man , weary ! Down to the marrow of my bones and the roots of my soul . And you two want me to get up and preach tonight . You want to make me , the way I am and the way I feel , to stand up one more time and preach ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Blood suckers , living off of my blood and my sweat . . . ! " Hold tight , everybody . Here we go ! Round and round and nobody wins . We got a breather anyway because here 's Miami back already with a new bottle and it 's going to take him a minute to rip off the wrapping and pull the cork . MiamiHe finally gets the bottle open and takes a sip . I could have opened it myself or anyway offered to , but damn if I would and damn if he will ask me to . " Moses , " he says . " You 're a Jew , ai n't you ? Do n't be shy . You ca n't fool me . I can smell Jew . You smell just like a Jew to me . " Fat Moses do n't say a word . It 's old . We 've been this route so many times before . Moses , he probably is a Jew . Who knows ? It 's for sure he does n't . Brought up in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . Took on the stage name of Moses for the lack of anything better . He squints his eyes and shrugs , wo n't say a word . A man like that at a time like this , when he wo n't fight back or anything , he makes you feel like you want to hit him square in the middle , drive your arm up to the elbow . It 's an ugly feeling to have forced on you . Ugly to know that you would do it and that it would make you feel good and then guilty again for feeling good etc. , etc. , etc .

Meanwhile Red goes right ahead mercilessly bugging Cartwright . Not for all the wrong reasons either . In a way he 's trying to preach to him . A tough assignment since Cartwright does n't believe in any god or , if he does , it must be a god like Cartwright.  |p34A  mirror image complete with clip on bow tie , straw hat and a ruinous smile . Red is saying : " Then one fine day I came along to save you . I took you up into the mountains where the air was thin and clean . I got a tumbledown shack in a high meadow and I tied you down to the bed posts and then I talked you through the worst part . I talked and prayed and sang night and day . It was a regular filibuster . I read from the Scripture . I sang to you like a baby . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollering , puking , and cursing God 's name . Which old Job  --  who had it worse than you ever will  --  never did . I ministered unto you and when I finally turned you loose you were free , or anyway as free as you will ever be . Healed up , if not reborn . Maybe not saved , but anyway a new man . And you ca n't deny that . " " No , sir . " Red looks away from him , past us , not seeing us or anything really , his eyes dimmed with a cast of thought . Then turns back to Cartwright . " Where do you expect old Dreama is now ? " " I would n't know , " Cartwright says . " I have n't heard tell . " " God knows , " Red says . " And one of these days He is liable to point out the way to her . His Invisible Index Finger is going to point right at you wherever you are . We 'll probably be hanging around like this somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of a sudden , lo and behold , there she 'll be , Dreama the Denver Bombshell , fire in her eyes and murder in her heart , and a lawyer right behind her carrying a whole stack of legal papers . . . . " Red is only kidding him lightly now , but Cartwright reacts true to form like one of Pavlov 's drooling dogs . Punch the right button and he 'll do it every time . He ca n't help sneaking a quick look over his shoulder to see if she 's coming across the field after him right this minute . " Look at him ! " Red booms . " The sonofabitch has done turned green on us ! " Which is quite enough to make all three of us laugh , the pic/ture of that woman , imaginary to us anyway , named Dreama of all things , picking her way toward us across the lumpy field , walking in the highest of high heels , delicate and awkward at the same time , swinging her purse like a lethal weapon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lawyer , a solemn and distressed owl , arms loaded with papers all written in the precise chaos of legal jargon over which poor Cartwright can wrinkle his brow , can ponder with the perfect incredulous bafflementof a monkey trying to read a music score . Faced with all that sudden laughter , Cartwright has to grin a slow and sheepish grin and shrug with an eloquence worthy of any of the tribe of Abraham . " You know why I keep you around , Hookworm ? " " No , sir , I do n't guess I do . " " On account of you 're a symbol , a walking , talking , living , breathing symbol of the undeniable fact that there is no man so low , so worthless , contemptible and lost that he can not be chosen to be a servant of God . Hookworm , you continually restoremy confidence in my vocation . " " Seems like you might take a look at your ownself sometime , " Miami says . A mistake at the moment and she knows it as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly as if she had clapped both hands over her mouth . And Red , still smiling , has a sudden hard glinting light in his eyes . For a moment they look at each other , poker-faced and unflinching . " As long as we 're on the subject , " Red says , " let me tell you about the time I found Miami . " " Shut up , " she says . " There she was , without stitch one on , unless you could call the cigar smoke a kind of clothing , up on top of a table in a room full of men . She had already done her dancing and now she was doing stunts and tricks . Oh , she had her tricks , too . When I walked in the room the men had made a stack of quarters on the table and she was squatting down over those quarters . . . . " " I 'll scratch your eyes out , " she says.  |p36She  lunges at him , nails set like the claws of a cat , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a move quick as a striking snake . But Red is quick too , very quick for a big man . He steps to the side and his hands come up seizing her at both wrists , though not quite quick enough to stop one finger nail from flicking his cheek with a razor-fine line of red . Grinning , he tightens his grip without effort and sweat pops out all over her face at once and shines in the sunlight . Then her hands , white as chalk , go lax and limp . He lets her go . " You have a dirty mouth , " she says . " A dirty mouth goes with a dirty mind . " " Where would you ever find another one like me ? " He drinks , tilting his head back to do so , gulping now and letting whiskey spill over his chin . She has turned away and moves slowly , head down toward the trailer . " Miami ! " She stops . The line of her shoulders , even beneath the shapelessbulk of the bathrobe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your brains may be in your ass , " he says . " But I like to look at the eyes of somebody I 'm talking to . " When she turns back to him her face is set and calm . She lifts her chin and the old fire of pride is there in her eyes . " You look like hell wearing my bathrobe , " Red says . " Why do n't you buy me a new one ? " " Take it off . " " I will not . " " Take it off and do us a little dance . " One giant step and he is next to her , seizing the sash of the robe in a gnarled fist , yanking her to him , cheek to cheek like a pair of dancers . And he is speaking to her , a soft , lewd , reedy whisper not for my ears or Cartwright 's . I do not know the words he shames her with , do not hear them , yet I can read them in her eyes over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any . She is staring at me over his shoulder and her eyes are as blind and blank as glass.  | " That 's enough , Red , " I say . He whirls back to me now , astounded . " You better get rid of that bottle , " I say . " You 've had enough . " " Why ? " he says . " What if somebody should come along and see you ? " Red laughs so hard that his body bends and he slaps his bare thigh . I see Miami tighten the sash of the robe . She does that , but does not move away , not yet . She smooths the robe and pats her hair in place . Then she moves away , easy and unhurried toward the trailer , self-conscious , remembering all of her body now and hiking back her shoulders so that she can be tall and straight as she walks . " I 'm a star , " Red is saying . " I am just like a freaking movie star . Ai n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cartwright says . " You told me that one time , Moses , remember ? " " Yes .... " " Well then , if I am a celebrity and some kind of a star , I can do anything I please . " " You 're the boss , " I say . Miami is now inside the trailer . Cartwright " You mighty right I am the boss around here ! " Now for the first time Red has noticed the cages across the field over amongst the pine trees . I 've been wondering whenp38he will see them . Big rusty iron cages , some of them set up on slabs of concrete . " What 's all that ? " he says , pointing . " Evidently there used to be a zoo out here , " Moses says . Red keeps staring at them , shielding his eyes to look . " I guess they got the right idea in High Pines , " he says . " I bet they did n't put them cages up for no ordinary animal zoo . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those cages are probably for us . All these years they 've just been a waiting for us to get here . Well , here we are at last . " " What are you talking about ? " I say . " High Pines has got the right idea , Hookworm , old buddy . High Pines is the town of the future . One of these days every city and town in the world is going to build cages like that . They 'll start throwing them up , acres and acres , then miles and miles of them . In the end everybody will be in cages . The last man will have to lock his ownself in . Then they can give the world back to the animals and they can all come out of hiding and stand around and look at us . " I have to laugh . I mean , troubles or no , a fella ca n't help laughing and being tickled at a notion like that . Red must be kind of tickled too because all of a sudden he ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back like I am his old buddy . " Boy , you better be careful , " he says . " You 're number one on the reservation list . " We all hear it at once . We hear the bumblebee noise getting louder and coming toward us . " Would you just take a look at that ! " Here she comes again . Not much more this time than a blur , a smear of blue paint flying down the highway . Down the road and then screeching in a turn under the arch and bouncing across the field already without slowing down . Dust boiling out behind . " Wa-hool " Red hollers . " Yee-ha-ha ! "  |p39He  is running as fast as he can , running and waving his arms , yelling , laughing , running and all kind of leaping and jumping and dancing all at the same time . Like a lunatic somebody just turned loose of . It looks for sure they 're going to meet that way , head on and both going wide open . Like she is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack  --  right on over him . He keeps running for it and she keeps driving straight for him until I just know they are going to crash and I open my mouth to yell but do n't a single sound come . I 'm thinking maybe he will run right over top of that blue bug and crush it and her too flat like you would step on a cockroach . Then she stops and he does too . But he 's going too fast to pull up . He falls over top of the hood and rolls over quick on his back and rolls off it ( must be hotter than a tin roof , middle of July ) and lands on the ground next to the car , still laughing so we can hear him , looking straight up into the sky . Up goes the bottle and he takes a drink . Flat on his back . " Come on , " Moses says . Away he goes too , running ( not thinking cause we could 've easy drove in the car and got there quicker ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waddling fast would be the best way to say it . I do n't recall ever seeing Moze run for anything the whole time I 've known him . I 'm running too now , right behind Moses . Sonofabitch is moving , too ! He goes faster than it looks cause he 's going to get there first . We come up longside of the car , puffing and blowing . Red is stretched out on the grass , kicking his feet and laughing to hiseif . She is sitting there , that 's all . She do n't look happy or sad or glad or mad . She do n't look anything . Now standing up close enough to see what makes her have such a pair of eyes . She has got all this crazy eye makeup around them . Like she was in the show business or something . The funny thing is she ai n't got no other kind of makeup on her face . Not even lipstick.  | " He 's ill , " Moses is telling her . " Yeah , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Am not ill , " Red says . " I ai n't even sick . " I bend over to help him . " Come on , Red . " He ai n't about to notice me . He sits up , then kneels beside the car , holding onto the door , looking at her . " Blow the horn , " he says . " Do n't say one word until I hear the sound of that horn . " She looks at him real serious . Maybe she 's deaf . Or maybe she do n't understand . Or maybe she do n't approve worth a damn . I figure I better do something or say something quick and it better be the right thing for once , but before I can even think of a remark to make , she has a big smile and commences to toot on her horn . Toot-toot-toot-toot ! And finally HONK ! Because she leans forward against it and closes her eyes laughing with her shoulders shaking and heaving . Moses keeps a straight face . He 's mopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handkerchiefs . I sneak a look quick over my shoulder behind me to see where Miami is at . She 's there all right , standing next to the trailer . Looking at us . Looking and not liking it . " I 'm drunk , " Red says . " I do n't know if I can stand up again or not . " " I can see that , " she says , still smiling . Then he pulls himself up and stands over her , next to the car . She looks up and he looks down and all they can see are each other 's eyes . I sneak another look back to see what Miami is up to . Which is nothing . She 's gone back inside of the trailer . " You probably do n't remember me , " the girl tells Red . " Refresh me , " he says . " It goes back , " she says , " quite a few years . " " That 's a bad beginning , " Red says . " Make me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words back and forth the way some peap41ple play ping pong , but already I can see Red is sober as a judge , just listening . He 's that way . He can be drunk or he can be sober whenever he wants to . Moses is still standing there like a statue ( except who would ever make a statue of him except for a joke ? ) . Here I stand with my hat in my hand thinking one thing . Not listening , just thinking . Thinking that any minute now Miami is going to come busting out of the trailer with the shotgun in her hands . If she does , I 'm going to be ready . Soon as I see the door fly open and the light strike on that barrel , I 'm going to be gone . I 'll be gone so fast they ca n't even catch me in that blue bug . Me and Moses standing here like a pair of stuffed birds not moving a feather while Red and the girl are playing this kind of a ping pong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve gauge double-barrel shotgun . It may be old but it still shoots . Birdshot is probably all she 's going to be able to find . I hid the buckshot where nobody will ever look for it . After that time in Lexington , Kentucky , who would blame me ? Lucky for me I got a good start running because she still had to load it and I only got a kind of a whiff . The Doctor could pick them out with a tweezer . He thought it was pretty funny and maybe it was , too . But I sure hate to think what might have happened if that gun had been loaded to start with . I mean , I 'm a bony guy and I ai n't got too much ass to begin with , but if she 'd a got a good shot at me I would n't have none left at all . " I remember you , " Red says , all of a sudden serious . " I remember you well . I laid hands on you to heal you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head down and he reaches forward and lays both hands on her head like he does when he 's healing . But he do n't pray or say a word . It 's more like he was trying to remember what it was and where it was and when . That must be what he 's doing because he 's closed his eyes and his whole face is lined like he felt a pain or was lifting somethingheavy off the ground.  |p42I  watch them from the window . Red carrying on like a jackass . Moses brooding and worried . Hookworm waiting , poised like a rabbit or a squirrel waiting to dart away at the first sign of troublefrom any direction . And the girl . Well , she 's probably young which is something and sick which is nothing . They all are , the ones that come after him . She 's not the first one and wo n't be the last . If all they wanted was to get laid , then more power to them . He 'd dance them awhile . He 'd wave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleeping Beauty , oh smiling sweetly in her dream . But Red 's not Prince Charming . Music they never heard will blare in their ears , and they wake up from sweet dreams , empty as cotton candy , to monsters . And it does n't take long to find out the monsters were all there inside them all along . Shaky in the knees , they slip on their clothes in the dark and sneak away to Mama or Daddy or some fink husband named Harry . Who 'll cuddle , baby them . Croon lullabies and pretend that there are n't any monsters in the real world . Those are only shadows , honey . See I make them with my hands . And pretty soon their little minds heal up more or less and the whole world is cotton candy again and carrousel music . But , being women , they want something more . And being women they want me to leave him or be sent away . They want that more than anything else , once they get laid a couple of times and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should Ip43think I 'm the only one who is right for him ? It 's the woman in me , crying out in the old woman-language , a cat in the night . Suppose I did leave ? Or what if Red threw me out ? The ones I 've seen so far , the ones that follow him , would be nothing but bad news for him . Maybe they 'd have some money . They usually do . And I do n't deny that money could help Red keep going . But who would he reach for to talk to in the bad , black hours after midnight ? Who would understand a word he said to her ? There have been times when we lay on the bunk side by side and held hands like a couple of children and talked through until the sun finally decided to come up and chase all the ghosts back home . I watch out the window of the trailer , standing back a little so I wo n't be seen , holding the curtains aside with my fingers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they drive off to the edge of the trees , over by those cages , where there 's some shade . That 's because she 's ready to talk , to pour out her guts to him . He 's ready to listen . There 's nobody who can listen like Red does . And they all have to talk . Talk , talk , talk ! That 's one kind of intercourse they 're experts at . Let him lay her if he feels like it . Let him take her in one of those cages and treat her like she wants to be treated ! The other two , Moses and Cartwright , look at each other , look over here at the trailer , but ca n't see me , then back at each other and shrug . What can they say to each other ? Here they come scuffling along , kicking the dust . I guess they 'll start to unpack the truck ( which is a job , the way it 's packed so tight and neat ; we need a new one pretty soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red ; then throw her in a blackberry patch ) . They 'll go ahead and get started in case he changes his mind and decides to stay here and preach . Depending on that girl , he may and he may not . I turn away from the window . The trailer is hot as an oven already . I 'll air it out and clean up a little . No , instead I thinkp44I 'll get all dressed up and go to town . I might even find a store and buy myself a fancy robe  --  a peignoir . Make him eat his words and holler about my wasting all that money . Be worth it for the laugh . I slip out of the robe and fumble in my suitcase for some underclothes , some nice clean , sassy lingerie . I 'll drench myself in perfume so the men will cut their heads to watch me . But first . . . Like a girl , like a damn fool , I have to go look in the mirror . I know what I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the mileage and the use ; in fact , it 's kind of a miracle for a beatup woman to look so good . Prove that you ca n't tell the book by the cover or the package by the wrapping . I could probably find a husband he 'd never know he was umpteen hundred in line . Looking at myself , I feel cold all over . Goosebumps . And the trailer is getting hotter by the minute . What am I looking for ? It 's all there , where it was yesterday and will be , God willing , for a little while longer . To tell the truth , I 'm not so sure . I do n't know what I expect to see . That something had changed suddenly . That every sin , every mile , is now written all over me . Maybe like tattoos . Maybe not tattoos , but lines , scars , skin all corrupted and open sores , no nose , rotten with red swollen boils , dripping with pus . I would n't be surprised . Maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change for the better . To look in the mirror and see a young girl , golden haired , shy as a new moon . The kind who could slip into a satin bridal gown and blush and be pretty while blushing . I do n't know what I want to see . I do n't know what I want . When he looked at me the last time out there , I did n't see him anymore . I do n't know who it was , but it was n't Red . It was a stranger . I was hoping , I guess , that I was the one who had changed and made him change . Why did he look at me the way he did ?  |p45I  swear to God I never did anything so dumb in my whole life  --  to stand in front of a mirror and look at myself. why do I love him ca n't be gratitude even though I amgrateful but not enough to feel the way I do other menhave given me more &; have done more for me &; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of luckanywayI 've had my share of luck good bad &; no luck enough toknow it comes &; goes &; nothing can change thathe has more than enough faults failings I do n't can'tenvy him envy what all his blind sorrows &; blind furies &; blind gifts I do not believe a word of his preaching Ido believe though that he is God 's crude instrument I believethat somewhere inside me crouches a naked girl who howls &; begs for mercy she will receive none she will receive nothingno gift except a hairy fish wrapped in last week 's terribleheadlines I do not believe yet I do believe that somehowbecause of him even her howls are holy I have seen in hiseyes sometimes a glimpse like a flash in a cracked mirror of what he sees a reflection of what he sees which is only an occasionalkeyhole view of a garden full of flowers &; fountains where all of us are children again &; our voices are like birds inspring I do not believe in this garden &; know that I willnever enter into it even if there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him which is enoughif I lose him let me die &; rot on the frame of my bonesno not die because not believing not seeing not anything still have I seen &; known him believed him &; never no never can be the same againso take him or leave himmy heart will mend &; break again for hearts are fragile so sweep up the pieces in a dust pan go on living you can live fine without onewill not cry to lose him like a woman a fool a creature of moods &; tides &; moonswill depart in peace for he has given me what no other man couldI love him it is enoughp46Somebody is knocking at the trailer door . Through the small window at a distance I see Moses with a box of hymnbooks in his arm . It will be Cartwright up to no good whatever he 's up to . I reach for the bathrobe , then have a second thought . One last glimpse in the mirror a grin and a wink and quick to the door . I jerk it open . He blinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice is a mumble . " What 's the matter , Hookworm ? Ai n't you ever seen a nekkid girl before ? " I slam the door in his face and leave my laughter to yap at his heels like a dog. 49 " You probably do n't even remember the name of the town , " I say to him . " Maybe not , " he says , his face not showing anything , blank as a carved mask through which bright eyes peer . It should be a black mask , African , carved out of ebony , but it is white and pale . " Tell me something , " he says . " They told me , but I already forgot . What 's the name of this place ? " " High Pines . " " Oh , yeah , " he says . " Here 's to High Pines . . . . " And tilts his bottle to drink . He sits beside me , huge in this car , in the skimpy little undershorts like panties , his bottle of whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square hands . It could be so easily only the end of a crude , cruel practical joke . The joke and last laugh on me . I left John , without a word , asleep in the motel . He will wake up  --  has woken ! My God , that was a week ago  --  cursing my name , smashing furniture , the mirror . Then he finds that he has lost nothing , not a penny , not even a credit card , only his woman and her car . In fact he has gained because I did n't stop to pack . I slipped on my coat and tiptoed out while he lay on the bed like a teddy bear , his mouth wide open . At least he had all of the bed for once and woke up to find he had most of my things too . Now it could end in a joke . Here he sits beside me , a pale Apollo fashioned by Bernini ; no , more massive , hewn by Michelangeloin three dimensions , the Adam of the Sistine Chapelp50first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dreamed him this way . I remember only a tall , broad young man , first in a dark suit , later in shirt sleeves . I remember his voice . Like the deepest of woodwinds . I remember his hands . He ran across the field toward me laughing , clothed in brightnessonly , cavorting like a clown . He floated , absurd in the dusty , specked windshield , blurred even more by the speed . Shouting like a savage . I might have run him down and run over him , crushing his bones and spilling his guts and brains on the ground . On and over the other two too , his silly fools , tossing them high and limp like rag dolls . But as he came closer the sound of his laughter sang , tickled my ears like a pair of tongues . I waked from fury . I knew I would stop in time . Now in the shade with him . Blazing field behind and all around blue mountains like puffs of smoke . So cool , so blue , so light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of the string . I wink and they go away higher and higher and gone back to the sky . Leaving a world without mountains . Flat as west Texas . Flat and white as driftwood or the bleached skull of a steer . He looks at me calmly waiting , ready to listen . His eyes brimmingwith inner light . While I sit here waiting to talk truth , I am alone under a spotlight dancing for him , myself shining and free , dancing for joy with no music but the rhythm of my pulse . I am not afraid . " I want to tell you about it , " I say . " I was very sick , sick to death and you healed me . " " What was wrong with you ? " he says . " Oh , they said it was psychological , meaning , I guess , it was all in my head and could be cured by pills or electric shock or rest or analysis or what have you . I had given up any hope of ever being healed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ....  --  His broad brow wrinkles . He wonders . " It 's really very simple , " I say . " The doctor called it a classic case . "  | " How did it begin ? " " Begin with the house , " I say . " The biggest house in town . Call it my mother 's house . Everything in it was hers . Even my father 's pipes , his slippers . Everything she ever touched turned into something of hers the way Midas touched and turned everything to gold . The house smelled of her , clean , and sickly sweet . Like dying roses . Even potted plants bowed to her or she cut off their heads . My father lived there too , of course . A guest , a transient , a small , delicate shadow moving quietly , carefully , on tiptoesso as not to chip or break anything . " I was an only child . You might call it a sheltered life except there was neither shelter nor sanctuary . It was a prison , my mother the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked witch from a fairy tale . I slept . She kept me under glass , under a vacuumbell the way she preserved her bridal bouquet . It sat on the polished top of the piano . Flowers never fading , but never , except once , real . Maybe they never even slapped me when I was born . I only know I had to learn how to breathe . " Of course I played games , went to parties and church and school . But none of that was real . I passed among the others , friends and enemies and strangers , exactly the way my father moved among the clutter , the neat clutter of bric-a-brac and the potted plants . " Then there was a springtime in me . I began to change into a woman . I felt a new tingling in my veins , heard new sounds and noises . I began to listen to words . I had understood them but never heard . Now I heard without understanding the babble of a strange , foreign tongue . I was charmed and delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to look . Everything was new and strange , like digging for China in the backyard and suddenly poking a hole through and being there among pagodas and rice paddies and funny hats . And everything was good . It was all so good . . . .

" In town there were two kinds of people , the nice people andp53Trash . The Trash came from the little shacks at the edge of town , no different from and sometimes mixed in among the Negro shacks . Or else they came in from the country in dusty yellow school buses . And they wore funny clothes , hand-me-downs , castaways , charity . They never ate in the lunch room . They brought their food in paper bags . They ate outside together at tables in the schoolyard in the part we never went to . The boys were mostly barefoot and the girls wore funny shapeless dresses or else tight sweaters and lipstick early and rouge and dimestore perfume .

" I followed them . They waited for me . In front of a burnt out filling station with fields on both sides . They were all around me in a ring.  --  What are you following us for ?  --  I do n't know , I said .  --  I just want to see where you go . " They looked at each other , surprised . Then one of the girls , a fat ugly girl named Ida , I 'll never forget that , laughed .  --  You , she said .  --  What 's your name ?  --  Judith.  --  Let 's show Judith where we go after school .

Probably not . He 'll get a wild hair to be moving on and we 'll have to pack up everything again in a hurry and roll . Moze is bent over one of the footlockers fumbling for something . I get an idea , a inspiration , and step up next to him . " Gim me the glasses , " I say . " What glasses ? " " You know , them field glasses . " He hands them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field glasses with a strap too you can hang around your neck . I slip the strap over my neck and raise the glasses , fiddling with the focus . Two round foggy circles and then the two of them in the car across the field caught clear in the two circles , now one circle brightly clear . Red is n't sitting too close to her ( course you ca n't get very far apart in one of them bugs either ) . He 's leaning back , his arm dangling over the side of the car , his hand loose and slack , relaxed . Just listening . He wo n't hardly listen to me at all even when it 's important . She 's talking a mile a minute . Talks like she drives I guess . I can see her red hair , brighter than Red 's , and her suntanned face with eyes that look like black burnt holes at this distance on account of all that gunk she 's got around them . She 's still got on that black raincoat , buttoned all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting or Red would n't be botheringp57to listen . I mean , it ai n't like he was on duty or something .

It would take a crazy person to drive a car like that . It do n't take no genius to put two and two together and figure out she 's crazy as a jailhouse bedbug and got herself a case of the hot pants . People say a drunk woman is heaven in the bed . A crazy one 's even better sometimes . First time I ever got any was off of a old crazy girl back of the freight yard down home . Spoiled me for a long time , it was so good .

Or , what 's worse , she 'll take off and take her car with her ( cause it 's still registered in her name ; she may be dumb but she 's smart enough for that ) . That would leave us with nothing but that beat up old truck that 's got troubles enough hauling itself around without trying to pull the trailer too . And that little blue bug , she may make aplenty of noise and go like the wind , but she ai n't up to pulling no kind of a load . What I mean is , Miami , she will tolerate them girls down in Galveston on account of it 's their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country in a blue bug wide open and hell bent for trouble has got a chance . Moze is out of the running . He 's ugly as sin , but , you know , he 's got what some people call a soulful look . To me he looks constipated and maybe he is most of the time . Keeps a whole box full of all kinds of pills and things . Some days he gobbles them pills like peanuts . The long and the short of it is there 's only one candidatep58around here available to take care of the crazy girl in the blue bug . If she 's got problems , old Hookworm is just the doctor . He 's got the remedy . " Look out ! " I holler coming up off the ground like a rocket blasting off . I turn around quick and mad , too , expecting to see Moze , but there stands Miami laughing fit to kill . If it had 've been Moze I was all set to punch him in the mouth . If it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman I 'd punch her in the mouth right now . Everybody knows how goosey I am and it ai n't funny a damn bit . Miami is all dressed up , I mean , looking good . She can look like somebody when she gets fixed up . She 's got that expensive perfume on , too . She wo n't wear cheap stuff when it comes to perfume , only the best . And she 's right , too . The good stuff works , it gets to a man and stays with him awhile . You can remember a good perfume . " See anything interesting ? " " Miami , " I say to her serious , " how come you always got to tease me ? " She smiles at me and gives me a friendly pat . " I tease you cause I like you , " she says . I got to give that some thought . I mean , a woman that picks on you and teases all the time , she might still be teasing right now . " That 's news to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says smiling , stepping up real close so our two noses just about touch and bumping me with her boobies . " Shame on you , " she says all kind of whispery , breathingright on me and her breath smells sweet , too , like she done gargled with perfume . " I always thought you liked me , too . " Something funny is going on around here this morning . Moze has stopped what he was doing and is standing watching us with his pokerface , mopping his brow with a folded handkerchief . Why do n't he just get hiself a sponge ? Be a whole lot cheaper ...  | " Cat got your tongue ? " she says , flicking her tongue quick between her teeth like a little red wet snake . " What do you want ? " I say . She makes a pout and steps away from me , opens her purse and her compact and looks at herself in the little mirror . " You sure do look good , Miami , " I say , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You look like a million dollars . " That must be the right thing to say for once because she pops that compact closed and looks up at me with the nicest smile she ever give me . " Where are you going ? " That 's Moze for you . He 's got to know what 's going on every minute . " Nowhere special , " Miami says . " I just got a little shopping to do and I thought maybe I 'd go sit in an air-conditioned movie for a while if they 've got one . Anybody want to go see a movie ? " " We 've got a lot of work to do , " Moze says . " How about you ? " she says to me . Now I know something is going on . She knows how I like the movies . I 'd rather sit and watch a movie than almost anything else you can name ( not including , of course , that ) . But I happen to recall that Miami do n't care nothing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows . " " I can take them or leave them , " she says . " But the idea of sitting in a cool place is just about like heaven right now . Besides . . . " ( and here she lowers her voice way down soft where Moze ca n't hear ) " I 've got some important things to talk about . " Cartwright , you may be letting your first and last chance slip by . You may be pulling the chain and flushing it right down the drain . If you had any sense , you would n't even stop to think about nothing . Just go , boy , go ! You 'll never figure out women anyway . There ai n't no way . Life 's too short . If a chance comes along , grab it like it might be your last one because you never know . But I 've known Miami too long and this ai n't right . " I guess I better stay here and help Moze , " I say.  |p60She  makes another little pout , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys really think Big Red 's going to change his mind ? " I take a look over towards the car hearing Moze say , " You never know . . . . " She is standing right behind me , flush up against me . I smell that perfume and her hands come over my shoulders and lift up the field glasses . She moves her head alongside of mine , almostcheek to cheek with her hair brushing against me and looks through the glasses , kind of resting on my shoulder . I ca n't explainwhy  --  maybe it 's the same reason why I 'm goosey , born that way  --  but when a woman comes up behind me like that , it drives me up the wall . " I do n't believe he 's going to preach tonight . He wo n't be able to . He 's going to be all wore out from listening . " She lets the glasses go , but gently so they wo n't pull the strap around my neck , and , casual as you please , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets that hand keep right on going down past my belt , down the length of my fly with a kind of a flick and then gone as she turns away toward the car and oh Jesus ! I like to have done it right in my pants . She knows , Lord save us all , that Miami knows everything there is about the weakness of a man . You could hate her for it if it did n't feel so good . " Bye , boys , " she says . " See you later . " With a voice like a young girl 's , all sing-song and tra-la-la . I move my head to watch her go . ( I ca n't turn around for a minute anyway because old Moze will see the state I 'm in and laugh . I ca n't help it . Nobody could . It 's bio-logical and bigger than me . But he would laugh anyway . That 's the way he is . ) I watch her , swinging her purse , walk to the car and step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe she must have the most beautiful ass in creation . She hops in the car and turns on the engine , then looks back and smiles , waving her hand . And she 's gone with a " see you later " tossed over her shoulder at us . I take a deep breath and try to think of cold water , a ice-coldp61mountain stream you jump into and come up blue and out of breath and all shrunk and shriveled up . My old scoutmaster ( I was a Eagle Scout , believe it or not ; I can prove it , though ; I 've got my merit badges right in the bottom of my footlocker in the trailer ) he always used to read us that part in the Boyscout Handbook where it says try not to think about it , but if you just ca n't help thinking about it , then get plenty of exercise and cold showers . Only trouble is there ai n't always a cold shower handy . So I use the power of my mind . I concentrate real hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it works unless you happen to get tempted right quick again . Works like a charm this time and I turn around and look at old Moze . He gives me a shrug of the shoulders . He can shrug like nobody else I ever seen . " I was still too green , the world was too new and shiny . I could no more conceive of guilt than a child who has n't been burned can know how live flame feels . My mother trained me for the practical things like fire , though . When I was still a toddler she took my hand and put it in the flame of the gas stove and held it , only a flash of a second , but enough so I thought she might never let go.  --  That 's fire , child , she said , gripping my mouth with her fingers , so I could n't scream and drown out what she had to say .  --  That was how fire feels . Keep away from it . " And I did too , out of fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Still , there was something else , something subtlep62and strange at the heart of my fear . I remember there was a kind of fascination too , with all flames and fires . I remember one time I wanted to burn up the garage . They kept old newspapers and cartons stocked in the garage and I took some matches and tried to start a fire . Lucky for me , Clytie caught me . She was n't even mad . She just took away the matches.  --  Lord , Lord , Lord , child , she said .  --  Ai n't you a mess ? Looks like I got to watch you every minute . " Then she took me by the hand and led me back to the kitchen and gave me some cookies or candy or something even though my mother did n't approve of eating between meals , especially sweets . That made it a secret between the two of us . I knew when she poured out a glass of milk for me and gave me the cookies that she would n't tell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that way without saying a word . " So I did n't tell on them that time . I had a nice hot bath and felt good about it . Proud in a way , as if I had passed the initiation to some secret club . And the next day and every day after that I got Clytie to make me a lunch and put it in a paper bag . I used my lunch money to buy candy bars for them . At lunchtime I went out and sat down at the table beside them . They were afraid I was going to tell and get them in trouble , but when I passed out the candy bars they knew I would n't . Poor Ida , I knew she 'd love candy . She was my friend after that , as much as she could ever be friends with anyone . They all acceptedme  --  maybe not as one of them but anyway not against them . Except Roy . He was the one who knew about Daddy beingthe judge . He was the one who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of , no reason to be beholden to me . Every day I brought him a candy bar too . And every day he left it sitting on the table , to melt for all he cared . ( Ida would usually end up eating it . ) At first I thought he was proud , but then it began to dawn on me that he was ashamed of something . None of the others were ashamed , only afraid . But he was ashamed and I was making him feel ashamed . So I stopped offering himp63a candy bar . ( I always had one for him with me in case he asked , but I stopped offering it to him . ) " One day at lunchtime he was waiting for me by the door when I came out.  --  I got to talk to you , he said .  --  I got something to say . " We walked over under the shade of a tree far enough away from the tables and the others so no one could hear . I leaned back against the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great big hulking boy with hands like hams and he never knew what to do with them . When he was nervous or shy or awkward he would stand there and crack his knuckles . He stood in front of me , not wanting to look me in the eyes , kicking at clods of dust , and cracking his knuckles.  --  All right , he said finally .  --  I 'm the one that did it.  --  Did what ? " Stumbling , awkward , painful :  --  I 'm the one that swiped your panties. ( then quickly )  --  Do n't nobody know but me . Nobody saw me and I ai n't told a soul.  --  Thank you for telling me , I said .  --  I wondered what happened to them.  --  I got them right here , he said , patting a bulge in the pocket of his Levi 's . It crinkled with a sound of tissue paper . " He had them all wrapped up in tissue paper ! " I see him start to laugh , a ripple of the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Wait , " I say . " That 's not the best part . "  --  You can have them back if you want them , Roy said . " He said he had washed them himself with Camay soap he bought at the drugstore . They were all clean and he had n't even touched them again . He had wrapped them up in tissue paper and he was ready to give them back.  --  I do n't want them back , I said . " And I could see he felt worse than ever . So I told him I had quit wearing them after that day because it felt good without them and it did n't seem worth the trouble of putting them onp64if people were just going to come along like that and yank them off again . " " That was the woman in you , " he says . " The woman taking command . " " It was pretty mean , " I say . " I did n't want to hurt or embarrasshim , but I could n't help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush and he could n't look at me anymore . " " A woman is born with a sense of irony , " he says to me . " A man has to learn it . " " So I told him I wanted him to do me a favor , just like the knights of old in the history book . I wanted him to keep them for me , to carry them always just like that , wrapped up in tissue paper and clean . That they were our secret and he must never tell anyone or touch them again or else I would make him give them back . He did n't laugh or anything . He just looked right at me and said it would be a privilege.  --  One more thing , he said .  --  I reckon I 'll take a candy bar now if you got one for me . Now he can not control himself any longer . He laughs so hard he grabs the sides of his waist to hold himself together . And I laugh , letting it all go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast of it , we laugh together . MOSeSI am trying to work without benefit of Cartwright 's aid when the sound of that horn makes me jump and twitch like a rabbit . " Slow down , Moze , " Cartwright says . " You may have a heart attack or something . "  | " Give me a hand , will you ? " I say . " We have a lot to do . " " He ai n't going to preach . " " Maybe he will change his mind . " I bend over the footlocker trying to sort out the mess . He comes over and finds the field glasses . I do n't know why we need those field glasses or what on earth we can use them for . But he talked Red into getting them and I guess we 're stuck with them . " What do we need those for ? " " Birdwatching , " he says . Red must be having a time , listening to that girl . He likes to listen to the wild ones , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his job . How else can he learn ? Which is why he listens . He 's always looking and listening even when he 's talking . He wants to know . Maybe that 's the power that keeps his gift alive . He will not let his mind set like concrete . He is all questions , always questioning , storing it all up deep the way a poet or an artist does . Here comes Miami out of the trailer . She 's got on her best dress , her sexiest outfit , looking for trouble . Which is exactly what I 've been afraid of all morning . Trouble we 've got enough of . More trouble we do n't need . I look at her hoping she 'll read the " please do n't " in my eyes , but she winks and sneaks up behindCartwright and gives him a goose that would raise a hippo off the ground . ' When he whirls around he 's face to face with Miami . He literally sags in the knees . " How 's the birdwatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tease me all the time ? " he says . " I like you , " she says . " Did n't you know that ? " Maybe she 's made up her mind to leave . In which case Cartwrighthas always been part of at least one plan . Maybe she 's ready to go now . That dangling purse could be crammed with money . She hops in the car and drives away for good and all . But she would have to open the safe . Which would put me in a spot ,  |p66as  the only one here , who officially knows the combination . It 's no defense to say that a woman like Miami could n't share a trailer with any safe in the world for a week and not know the combination . If she never opens it , still I know that she knows and could open it as easily as a bicycle lock . She has opened her purse now and stands checking herself in her compact mirror . " Where are you planning to go ? " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . Don'tworry , I 've got plans all right , the look says , but you 'll know when the time comes . I owe you that much . Meanwhile chatteringalong about window shopping and maybe the movies , knowing that Cartwright would give his soul to go to the movies , especially with her ; and knowing he ca n't , wo n't , would n't dare . Doing it well , doing it nicely . He may be suspicious . But he has n't got the sensitivity to detect her cruelty . He ca n't , locked in a mad world where all women are flowers , a garden of nudes in the sun , a dream of that garden , high-walled with himselfthe sole proprietor and gardener and not even a bee can sniff or a bird nest without his permission , a childish , happy , tawdry dream , he is n't able , so self-crippled by his own illusions , to use his mind and see her in abstraction , sexless , another human being , a soul , a mystery to be reckoned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's up to includes him and includes me , but later , not now . Virtuoso always , she borrows the glasses and standing behind him , leaning against him , looks at the car and Red and the girl in the shade . Poor Cartwright , such indignity , such swellingand groaning he must endure until the day he dies . A puppet not only of any woman who touches him , but a puppet of his own glands , led like an ox with a ring in his nose by a few shabby inches , less than a pound of flesh . His only salvation would have been , long ago , a life in rags on the burning desert , a bed of nails and the sun to stare at until his eyes rotted out . It 's too late now . Take him as comic , you can hardly help it . Or see him asp67pathetic , the archetype of the folly of being a man , a folly that offends so because all of us share it . Thinking of Cartwright , I remember something from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin of human love and desire . That once we were whole , neither men nor women , sexless and happy , one creature . Until the gods punished man for some disobedience or pride by tearinghim in two . We became two separate parts as if cut in half , each incomplete without the other . And then the gods laughed , the laughing white gods lounging in nude and ideal beauty against the splendid theatrical backdrop of Olympus . They laughed and will laugh still until the end of the world as these fumbling , grotesque , amputated creatures , stumble through days and nights in vain seeking their lost other halves , meanwhilecondemned to be freaks , monstrosities , fools . Condemned to blind and burning impulse without knowing why or what for , able only to give it a name while they burn . And able , of course , gifted with enough fragments of the broken Truth , to delude and deceive themselves . To wander a lifetime through a hall of mirrors , not like Versailles and the strut of powdered and elegant charms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amusement park , where you see yourself in many poses , fat and thin , short and tall , but never truly , until in the end , frantic , you run from mirror to mirror and see only a shiver of lewd poses flash past like the face cards of a gambler 's shuffled deck ! See Cartwright and believe in those old gods and almost hear the continual music of their laughter . He , too , must hear it constantly but , like poor Caliban , he can not give it a name . Then away she goes with a fine handsome strut and a bye-bye for both of us . My God , what a woman ! You can believe every fairy tale you ever read . She 's witches and wicked stepmothers and cruel stepsisters and always , too , Cinderella , Sleeping Beauty , the enchanted helpless Princess to whom , alas , no  --  charmingPrince will ever come.  |p68She  drives away and after a moment Cartwright turns to me like a living , animated question mark . What can I do ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says nothing , only smiles and nods for me to go on . I see myself with wonder now , as if I were a wooden dummy sitting in my own lap and clacking words . Why do I do this ? Layer by layer to peel away oneself . It hurts , but his smile and the eyes in the mask tell me he knows that it hurts and knows about pain . He is here beside me . I am helpless anyway . " Began not even then but before that , somewhere long before even memory . In the first shriek of my birth or before that . Maybe when a little , twitchy tadpole of sperm shot out , fired like a circus acrobat out of a cannon , and found the fertile egg . You can go back before then to Daddy and Mama , young and burning , beyond that even , back through generations , a wildernessfrom which strangers glare , back , back , back . . . . " " To Adam and Eve , " he says quietly . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks away from me , squinting across the field toward the trailer . I look too and see the woman come out of the trailer . She wears a red dress . She teeters on high heels . She is talking to the other two . Then he looks back to me , his face calm , all his attention for me . He nods and I go on , impelled . " And then , then quite suddenly it was summer . School wasp69over and that was all over for me . I was tired of everything . We were going away to the beach later on and that would be fun . I spent the lazy days of June in the Library reading . I read everything I could because books were all new too . They were beginning to mean something that summer , to be about some-thing . " I hear the car drive off and see she is driving it away , but he has never taken his eyes off me . " There was a boy who lived on the same block we did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polite to grownups and very correct , but shy . At dancing class he would always dance with you at least once . His palms sweated . I can not tell how much that disgusted me or why it did . But it did . He was fat and pale and wore thick glasses and was terribly intense . " That summer Edgar was at the Library too , reading and studying to prepare for his College Board Exams , he said . He 'd usually walk home with me in the afternoon . We talked about schoolwork and books and things . It was good to have company and to have somebody to carry my books . There were two or three different ways to walk home from the Library and we 'd try one on one day and another the next . One way to go passed by a park where we all used to play when we were little.  --  Let 's look at the park , he said one day.  --  Why ?  --  Just to do something different , he said . " So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seesaws . They seemed so small now , the way things are when you come back to them after a long time , smaller and kind of sad . But I was happy and I let him push me in the swing awhile.  --  Let 's go look at the old haunted house , he said . " At the edge of the park was an old house we had always called haunted . ' An old lady had lived there alone for years and nobody except the maid ever saw her . She died and the house was empty and slowly falling down . She had lots of plants and shrubs , some of them from as far away as India and China , strange , beautiful plants . When she died , they grew wild in ap70jungle all around the place . It was all green and dark and shadowy . When we were little , playing in the park we used to sneak up as close to the house as we dared and then always run away yelling because someone would say they saw the ghost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " Edgar dared me to go inside.  --  Do n't be silly , I said .  --  There 's nothing inside that old house .  --  I dare you , he said . " That always worked with me , a dare . They could dare me to do anything , once upon a time , even things the boys would n't do , and I 'd do it . So we went in and it was a dusty place , empty except for a few broken things that might have been hers or somebody else 's . I looked around and felt sad . Our wonderful haunted house was n't haunted at all . There were n't any ghosts left in the world . I think I would have been happy if only she had come running down the stairs cursing us and shaking her cane in a rage . " I remember I picked up a piece of broken glass , a piece of a mirror , all tarnished and dusty . I looked at myself to see how sad I could look , to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry if I wanted to for all the sad things ? Edgar 's face was in the glass too . He looked sad , but it was hard to tell because he had taken off his glasses and without them he had to strain to see.  --  What 's the matter , Edgar ?  --  Nothing.  --  Did you lose your glasses ?  --  No , ... I took them off.  --  Why ?  --  I ca n't kiss with my glasses on , he said , still looking sad .  --  Are you going to kiss somebody ?  --  I love you , Judith , he said .  --  Kiss me . " Then he closed his eyes completely and puckered his lips and I could n't help laughing even if it hurt his feelings . " He stood there pouting like a spoiled baby . I thought he was about to cry . I did n't want to have to see that , so I hugged him and gave him a peck on the cheek  | " That was enough , I guess , more than he hoped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I really love you , he said .  --  You have no idea how much I love you.  --  I 'm glad , I said.  --  I suffer , he said .  --  I ca n't get to sleep . Sometimes I see the light in your window late at night when you 're reading or something ... .  --  Do you spy on me , Edgar ? I said.  --  Oh , no , he said .  --  I would n't do something like that . I see the light and I think of you up there . I think of you and I ache and I ca n't go to sleep.  --  I 'm sorry if I 've caused you aches and pains.  --  We have lots of things in common , he said .  --  We both like books and things.  --  It 's getting late , I said .  --  We 'd better go home.  --  Do n't you even love me a little ?  --  I 'll have to think about it , I said . " That seemed to suit him fine . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughs at that and it 's funny all right . But now it stops being funny . Maybe he knows it 's the last time he 'll have a chance to laugh . Howie LoomisIt 's lunchtime and the store 's pretty quiet right now . I 'm thinking about maybe going out now myself and having a good bigp72lunch . Fellow gets to a certain age and three meals a day is about all he 's got to look for . I am coming out of my office , when I see the woman walk in , a woman in a red dress and really stacked , built and put together like you do n't see them too often . I can see that much clean across the store without even going back for my glasses . Which , as usual , I forgot . You can tell by the way that they walk , the way they can walk a race horse past you and if you got any feelingand experience you know whether that horse can run or not . It 's in the way she 's built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen any woman walk like that . It 's a crying shame to see it all wasted on Mr. Percy . He comes up to her knowing enough to put out his friendliest greeting and I can tell the way she 's standing she had him zeroed in before he said a word . They come down the rack of the summer dresses , the first class merchandise . She takes one off the rack and holds it up to her chin and looks at Mr. Percy . He 's nodding and smiling as well he might . That 's a easy customer to please . She looks good in anything or nothing and she knows it . They ai n't made nothing in her size yet she wo n't look good in . She 'd stir up folks dressed in black as a widow . Hold on , Howie . Get ahold of yourself . You do n't want to have a stroke or something before you have lunch . Do n't keel over dead on a empty stomach . She 's going back to try on the dress and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pulled off the rack . I go back in the office to get my glasses . But I do n't put them on . I know I 've seen that woman someplace before . I ca n't remember where it was . . . ( must be getting senile too ) . . . but with or without my glasses . But where would it be and when ? I know I never spoke to her or she to me . I 'd sure as hell rememberthat . I never forget something like that . Where was it ? I sit there raking the ashes of my brain and coming up with nothing at all . . . .  |p73A  while goes by , must have gone by , with me thinking and trying to remember , when here comes Mr. Percy swishing in the office and waving dollar bills in my face . " Five dresses ! " he says . " The lady bought five dresses just like that , cash sale ! " " That 's nice , Mr. Percy . " " Nice ? " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to be the one to disillusion Mr. Percy about his charm and talent for salesmanship . When that lady came in , she was intent on blowing her money , her own or somebody else 's ( more likely the latter ) on the first things that caught her eye . The plain truth being that old Percy could n't give her the stuff if she had n't already made up her mind . " Anything else ? Did you sell her anything else ? " " Well ! " he says , huffy as a old maid . " She almost bought the robe . " " What robe is that ? " " The gold lame one , " he says , " you know the one that 's snug in the waist and then kind of falls in an elegant line like this . . . . " I wish to hell I had a picture of Mr. Percy when he talks about ladies ' clothes . He gets so enthusiastic . You can almost see him in whatever it is . If I had the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into nightclubs and let him stand up and describe women 's clothes . Funniest thing since Will Rogers . I could die rich on ten percent of that . " That thing 's been hanging around here for years , " I say . " Who ordered it anyway ? Did you ? " " No , sir , I did not . I certainly know better than to order a thing of beauty like that for High Pines . " " What are we asking for it ? " " Cost , " he says . " Two hundred dollars . " I whistle through my false teeth . " You mean to stand there and tell me , Mr. Percy , tell me withp74a straight face we got a item of clothing hanging out there on the rack in the store that cost us two hundred dollars ? " " I do n't take any responsibility , " Percy says . " Did n't you even try to bargain with the lady ? That 's half the fun , Mr. Percy , the bargaining . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun ? " " Mr. Loomis , you are perfectly aware that when an item of merchandise is reduced to cost , I have n't got the authority to ... " " Is the lady gone yet ? " " I do n't know , " he says . " They were wrapping the packages . . . . " " Do n't stand there like a nanny goat ! Go get her and bring me the robe . . . ! " He 's gone . That 's one good thing about Mr. Percy . You yell at him loud enough and he reacts . He responds very well . His mother , of course , she do n't do nothing but yell at him . She ca n't help it . The old lady 's been deaf as a gatepost for years . I open the desk drawer and reach for the box of cigars I save for salesmen and special customers . No , I ai n't going to offer her one . I 'm fixing to smoke one myself , first one in a week or ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doctor 's order or no , you only live once . I get it lit good and here comes Mr. Percy , bowing her in , carrying the robe in his hands . I stand up , pull in my gut , and shake hands with her . " How do , ma 'm , I 'm Howie Loomis , the owner . Wo n't you take a seat ? " I turn and take the robe from Percy . " Thank you , Mr. Percy . That 'll be all . " That really burns him up because if there 's one thing he wants to know it 's how much or how little I 'm fixing to give it away for . And , know something ? Percy ai n't ever going to know . I 'm going to die without telling him . From the look on his face as he goes out , I reckon he suspects it , too . I toss the robe across the top of the desk where the light canp75catch it good . A real fine piece of merchandise all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not worried , calm caution you 'd have to say , and she keeps her eyes on me . I take a puff on my cigar , I smile and sit down behind my desk . " I hope you do n't mind my smoking a cigar , " I say . " I 've smelled a cigar before . " Flat , monotone . Tough . I would n't want to get in a card game with this one , not if you was playing for anything real . " Well now , " I say , " we 're mighty pleased to have your business , Miss . . . Excuse me , I did n't get your name . " " I did n't say . " " Well now , we 're mighty pleased . Are you going to be with us long , here in High Pines ? " " I do n't know . " " I was going to suggest , if you was planning to be in town any length of time , you might be interested in one of our charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " That 's fine , but you got to admit it 's kind of unusual in this day and age , the age of the credit card . Looka here .... " I whip out my wallet and dangle a long row of credit cards like the flags on the mast of a ship . " Is n't that nice ? " she says . " You 've got all kinds of credit . " I 'll be a monkey 's uncle if I 'm going to miss my lunch and smoke a cigar and everything and then let Percy have the last laugh on me for the first time in his life . This woman is walking out of here with that robe if I have to give it to her . I may end up paying her to take it off of my hands . " Mr. Percy tells me that you like this robe . " " It 's too expensive . " " I do n't see why we ca n't work out something . " " Look , " she says irritably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy five dresses right off the rack and pay cash for them . Is that some kind of a crime around here ? I said I do n't want the robe . It 's too expensive . " " What are you willing to pay for it ? "  | " Nothing . I do n't need it . " " Would you just sit down a minute , Miss ? Just do me thatfavor . " " Why ? " " Because I still think we can work something out , something to our mutual advantages , so to speak . " She looks at me , then she sits down again and crosses her legs . Smooth girl . She could sit like that and face a firing squad . " I wonder if you have a cigarette ? " she says . I put on my glasses and reach in the desk for a pack of cigarettes . Judith " Next day I had to go downtown to do some shopping . I met Roy on the sidewalk . He was delivering packages . I smiled and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He mumbled and would n't look at me . He cracked his knuckles and sulked . I asked him what was the matter . Nothing , he said , but I kept after him.  --  It 's that boy you go around with , he said.  --  What boy ?  --  The one you walk home with from the Library every evening , he said . " I was pleased ( what girl would n't be ? ) to find out he 'd been spying on me . And it was there , right on the tip of my tongue , to say the right thing . I could have laughed and made him laugh too , if I told him about Edgar . Even so , something else moved inside me and spoke for me . I told Roy it was none of his business and I did n't like him spying on me . I said Edgar was cutep77and smart and clean and he loved me , the kind of boy I 'd probablymarry some day . And then I prissed away and left him scowling . " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that something would happen for sure because I willed it and had the power to make it happen with a few words and glances . I was drunk with the idea of that . " But not really . I mean , yes , I was intoxicated with myself growing up , but at the same time I , the real me , was n't there at all . I was somewhere else , outside of space , if not out of time , watching a girl spend the afternoon in the Library , sitting next to Edgar at the reading desk , idly , accidentally , brushing against him , carefully checking out a whole armload of books for him to carry , and walking down the steps with him as they closed the doors behind us . I guess you 'd have to say there were three of me , then , divided in three the way a cell multiplies and divides . There was the one who watched . There was the girl walking with Edgar , calm , cool , even a little coy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , a drunken savage , a creature fierce with wordless knowledge . " I asked Edgar to go back to the haunted house with me . He looked a little nervous , as if he sensed my malice without being able to believe it ( for what reason could I have to want to be cruel ? ) . He said he was sorry about the time before , not that he had n't meant what he said and not that he was really ashamed of thinking it or saying it , but that he had n't been able to help himself . " We stopped and he stood facing me with all that load of books in his arms . I took off his glasses and kissed him on the mouth and then I ran away from him across the playground toward the house . I looked back and saw him , floundering like someone running in deep sand , blind without his glasses , burdenedwith books . I ran faster , ducking through the tangled plants . " As soon as I shut the door behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roy was angry but the other two triedp78to look casual , unconcerned . I knew that he would not be alone . He raised his hand to hit me across the face , but I caught his arm and I winked.  --  He 's coming , I said to him . " I walked away with my back to the door looking to see if I could find in the already waning light ( it was green with the sun low , shining its last through branches and brambles and bushes , an undersea light ; I was walking on the bottom of the ocean searching for a dropped jewel ) the piece of mirror I had looked into yesterday , knowing I would find a perfect stranger , waiting for me in that jagged glass . Hearing , as if far away , the sound of someone running up the front steps heavily , the door banging open and then a gasp , a gasp , not a cry or a word , and the sound of the books tumbling . I picked up the mirror , listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his body struck the floor . Then I looked . I had n't changed at all . ' Which made me feel cold , goose pimples that I could be so changed and yet my face , my eyes , the little smile , remain the same.  --  Do n't please . Do n't please . Do n't . . . ! Edgar was saying . " I stop talking . I do n't want to tell anymore , not any of it . I want to say , it never happened nor any of the rest of it I madeit all up I made it all up to shock people to shock you ... . But one hand grips my hair and he yanks my head around to face him again , then that hand lets go and the other , holding my chin as if it were an eggshell , lifts it and I have to look into his eyes . He is not smiling now , his brow is furrowed , his lips pursed a little as if to spit . . . or kiss .... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of it too and how he healed me and then be done with it . " You have to understand , " I say . " I was fourteen years old , going on fifteen , partly a woman , already able to bear children , but partly a girl  --  always a little girl in a white party dress and my hair in pigtails and black , patent leather shoes . . . . " There is no nod , not even a blink of the eyes behind the mask , nor any slackening of the vise on my chin.  | " I had never seen a man like that before ! " Still nothing from him , neither pity nor anger nor contempt . " I looked in the mirror , making faces at myself.  --  Come here , Roy said . " I turned and saw how two of them were holding him down and Roy was standing over him.  --  Come here , he said . " I heard Edgar gag and thought , poor Edgar , they 're not goingto hurt you they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid of . . . . " I looked into his eyes . I smiled . Nobody was holding his mouth closed . They knew that whether he yelled or not nobody would hear him here . His face seemed a long way away , small . He opened his mouth wide , but no sound came . I wanted it to be right ; so I took one of the books and carefully ripped out some pages , balled them up , then stuffed the wad of paper in his mouth . " Then I came around and kneeled between Edgar 's spread bare legs.  --  What kind of a man would that be to many ? Roy said . " I did n't choose to answer him . I knelt there between his spread legs , sprinkled with fine , dark hairs . He started thrashing and gagging on the paper , so I got up again and looked down at him . Tears in his eyes and trying to shake his head , to plead with his eyes.  --  Do n't worry , Edgar , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys laughed , but I was n't trying to be funny . He twisted his head away as far as he could and closed his eyes . " Now , I thought , now I will touch him . . . .

I wondered if someone had hurt him . I would n't like that . I remember I was very calm . I looked at the books and decided to come back and get them some other time.  --  Come on , Edgar . It 's time to go home . " He would n't look at me.  --  You do n't have to carry my books . Let 's leave them and come back tomorrow . " He turned over and hid his face and sobbed . I remember thinking how silly he was being . I tried to think of something nice to tell him , but if he was going to act like a baby , I 'd walk home all by myself . " MiamiThis old guy is not to be believed . He 's a character and shrewd . But a hick , a hayseed , a rube to the core . Once one always one . He opens a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk lighter for me where I have to lean well forward to light it.  | " Keep the pack , " he says . " Were you ever in Atlantic City ? I used to go there sometimes on conventions . " " No , " I say . " I 've never been there . " " I never mistake a face or a voice , " he says . " I know I 've seen you somewhere . " " Maybe . I 've been here and there . " " I 'd know and remember if I ever had the pleasure of meeting you . " " I used to be a dancer , " I say . " Maybe you saw me dance some-where . " That usually works . The world 's full of dancers of all kinds . He shakes his head , puffs on that cigar and thinks . Then his eyes brighten and he snaps his fingers . " The movies ! " he says . " Were you ever in the movies ? " " Mr. Loomis , " I say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here with Big Red Smalley 's Gospel Troupe . Maybe that 's where you saw me . " " Doubt it , " he says , very cocky now , flipping the ash of his cigar on the floor . " I would n't go to a tent meeting if it was the last form of entertainment left on the face of the earth . " " Maybe you 're missing something . You ought to come out tonight . I 'll leave you a ticket . " " I got all the tickets I can use already , " he says . " And I got ten percent of the show . " Look out , Miami . Time to exit with a sashay and a great big smile . " Well , I hope you change your mind , " I say , standing up , smoothing my skirt as demurely as possible . ( How about this red dress for a tent revival girl ? ) " We have a mighty good Christian evening planned . " " I remember you ! " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinner 's Revenge . " " I 'm sure I do n't know to what you 're referring .... " " Midgets ! " he says with a big , hearty laugh . " It had all those midgets in it . Funny as hell . I laughed myself sick . You know , considering the circumstances , you were n't bad . Maybe youp82missed your vocation . Maybe you could 've been a movie star . I mean , look at Joan Crawford . . . . " " Thanks , " I say sitting down , beginning to feel like a jack-inthe-box . " I 'm glad you enjoyed it . " " I feel better , " he says . " You do n't know how much better I feel . I 've been trying to place you ever since you walked in the store . " He takes off his glasses and puts them on the desk . He 's beamingand happy . I imagine ten-twenty years ago he was a sport . " Tell you what , " he says . " I 'm hungry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch and celebrate the triumph of memory . All things conspire towards forgetfulness , but patience worketh against all things . Or something like that . " " What do you want out of me , Mr. Loomis ? " " All I want you to do is take that robe . " " I bought the dresses . I paid for them . " " The profit on them dresses do n't mean a thing to me , " he says . " You can buy out the whole store and it still do n't mean a thing . I 'm getting old , Miss . Death has done touched me once . I 'm a marked man . Do me a favor and take the robe . " " Why ? Just tell me why . " He looks at me and the grin fades away , a dissolve like in a picture . It 's funny watching how the grin goes away because all of a sudden I think of that story about Alice in Wonderland or in Oz or Through the Looking Glass or wherever the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Which is something I always liked . The idea of that . Everything going except the grin . Of course , with my kind of luck , the only thing left would be you-know-what . " I 'll tell you something else , " he says to me . " The ten percentoff of your gross do n't mean anything to me . The Jew and the Worm in the Hat , they 're going to cheat me anyway . " " Why do n't you just send somebody to count . . . ? " " I 'm not finished yet , " he says . " I was saying your tent show do n't mean a thing to me . I 'm only doing it for a joke anyway . Me sponsoring a religious show around here . That 's a mightyp83fine laugh and worth it even if I had to pay for the privilege . Which , in a way , is exactly what I 'm doing .

He probably expects me to jump in and say something quick . Which is exactly what I 'm not going to do . I do n't know where you 're headed , old boy , but I 've gained one step on you because I know what you expect me to do next . Which is exactly why I wo n't do it . Until , of course , you get used to that and think you 've got me nailed down again . Still holding the phone off the hook he turns his head , not the chair , just his tilted old foxy head so he can see me . " We got a Sheriff in this County , " he says . " Great big fella name of Starr . Now , old Starr , he 's not dumb , he 's smart . He takes some things too serious for his own good . His job is one of them . I 'm just wondering , speculating so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to give him a call . " I can tell him to go play with himself and walk right out of the store and roll . I got my car and I got some new clothes . I 'd do it , too . It would serve Red right the way he 's been acting lately and treating everybody . But the one thing he really do n't like , the one thing that bugs him out of his mind , it 's the police , the Law . He 's got his reasons and do n't we all ? But on Red , I do n't know , I 'd rather spit on his Bible , and use his crucifix for kindling wood , I 'd almost rather kill him than to sic the law onto him . I believe in my heart he could stand burning at a stake or being nailed up to a cross , but I do n't think he 's got it to take the bright lights and the questions , the fingerprints and the picturewith a number , the typewriter clacking and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see him wither and die in bits and pieces . He deserves better than that . " You want me to give him a call ? " " No , " I say . " Mr. Loomis , you can hang up the phone . You drew to a straight flush and you win the pot . "  | " I like a gambling woman and a good loser , " he says . " I like class in horses and women . " " Thank you kindly , " I say . " What do I do next ? " " Well , " he says , " I guess I have ruined the chance of a pleasantlunch together . Why do n't you pick up that robe and get the hell out of here ?

" " Just one thing , " I say . " I can do it better with music . " " What kind of music ? " " You got a radio out in the store ? " He goes out . I unzip the red dress and slip out of it .

And I felt good and clean , blessed , too , for in some way I had shared in all the marvelous goodness of Creation . All that slow , steady , growing , thrusting , blooming , finally blossoming ( for something like that , like a perfect flower had bloomed and opened under my care , at my touch , by my ministry ) proved beyond shadows and doubts and once and for all that all things made were intended to be good and fine and strong and beautiful . Just then I know I could have kissed a leper for joy . " I know now most of the causes of my elation . I know , am aware , that simple and in this day incredible ignorance triggered my inner explosion ; that there was , no doubt , a confused marriageof revenge and penance for the earlier humiliation that had not seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for was n't I acting out the role of my mother ( as she seemed to me then ) again and punishing my father ( Edgar ) , yet even through punishing him trying to awaken in him pride in himself as a male so then I could offer myself as a sacrifice , full and sufficient , to that pride ( ? ) ; that there was textbook envy ( oh , I have read the books ) of the female for that little drop or dangle of flesh that frees him from all of the things a woman must live with , unjust , unfair that he or any man by accidental fusion , some action of chromosomes and genes , should be always more free and more fearless than I , not chained to the journey of the moon and the struggles of the tides ; oh yes there was that ;  |p86there  was also pride that I was chosen to be the receiver , the taker , the vessel without which that drop and dangle of flesh would wither and die of hunger ; power , knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tease , to withhold , to tug him ( or any man ) like a pet on a leash , to make him crawl and sit up or jump through hoops of fire , to make him content or to make him curse the day he was born ; for I , no , not I , but the least humbleparts of , love 's mansion set in the seat of excrement , was all of his hunger and need . " Of course all this is true enough , but somehow leaves us still on the outside of the sideshow , merely imagining the feats ( sword swallowers , fire eaters , magicians , boneless wonders , strong men ) and freaks ( fat ladies , bearded ladies , alligator girls , one-eyed , three-eyed , pinheaded , limbless creatures ) and fakes ( the headless girl all made by mirrors ) which compose a human soul . " Sex , yes , it was and is all about sex , I suppose . Much , much ado about the commonest impulse , one we share with coupling dogs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worms . Much ado about sex in a universe in which copulation thrives , world without end . They reduce everything to what they believe to be the naked truth of sex . Look closely and you see that lady has tights on , flesh colored tights . Ca n't we take sex , even the hunger and desire which seem at last the exposed truth , ca n't we take all this as merely a sign , another veil cloaking the Mystery ? " " The early church fathers did , " he says to me . " They knew all about burning and were n't afraid to look into the flames either . But even that was only a fitful shadow on the walls of a cave . " Then he laughs to himself . " Maybe , " he says , " we made our biggest mistake when we came out of caves in the first place . When we threw off animal skins , which I guess , are our true and proper clothing , in favor of armor , satin and lace , gabardine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop a Bomb and send us all back to the caves so we can begin again . " Now he drinks again and for the first time passes the bottlep87to me . I drink and look around at this quiet field with its crazy , opulent arch , at the trailer baking in the sun , at the two of them , his men , trying to put something together with tools and gesticulatingfuriously at each other ; and here the tall evergreens with patches of shade and the piney smell , litter of pine needles and pine cones , and here and there about us the curious , forlorn cages , empty . It 's almost noon now by the sun and so quiet and still . Earlier , even as I talked and remembered and he was listening , I heard birds in the trees and the scrabble and scuttle of little squirrels on the limbs and the ground . Now nothing is moving except far off a lone black speck , floating like a piece of ash on the air , a lazy buzzard circling , circling ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , beginning again , " as you know the beat of your heart or the life of your bowels without the words for any of it . " I came in the front door and the house seemed happy too . I could hear from upstairs the sound of water spilling into the tub for my mother 's bath . I smelled good things cooking in the kitchen and heard Clytie humming to herself the droning little tone she always used for rolling dough to make biscuits . I picturedher hands kneading the dough . Then I listened to the soft tick-tock of the grandfather 's clock . Tick-took , tick-tock , clickclock . I stood in front of it smiling , watching the long lazy roundheaded pendulum perform . I smiled and tipped my head in time with it . In the living room , where no lamp was burning yet , and only the last fire of the sunset and the first muted wink of the streetlights shone , the big oriental rug glowed like a garden of exotic flowers . I looked smiling on the heavy uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may have laughed . Something in the shadows groaned and stirred . It was my father stretched on the sofa with the evening paper open over his face . He rose , blinking , yawning , stretching , and padded toward me on soft slippers . He smiled and kissed me on the cheek  --  Hello , baby girl , he said . Then glanced at his pocket watch .  --  Better hurry . It 's almost time for supper.  | " I went skimming up stairs , light-footed , two and three at a time , humming Clytie 's biscuit tune . At the top I turned and saw him standing at the foot of the stairs , gray little man , slumpshouldered , in soft slippers , smiling . I waved . He waved the hand with the newspaper and made a crackling sound . " Later , it is after supper , I am alone in my room , propped up by pillows , reading . Keats was my favorite , and best of all , The Eve of St. Agnes . ' Only the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the overhead lights turn on . I see their faces ( my mother 's skin gray and stretched tight over her high fine bones like a Halloween mask , a skintight mask over her skull ; my father as if carrying a heavy load in his empty hands and the dull , wet luminous eyes of a dog about to be punished ) and I can tell at the glance they know what has happened ( what has happened ? what really happened ? ) . " I feel my lips form a smile.  --  Do n't just stand there , Mama says to him .  --  Speak to her ! " He comes to the edge of the bed and talks in a whisper . I close my book and put it aside . My mother stands over us both . I keep my smile for a while to help him . For he has to find the words and compose them . Bit by bit , in fragments and pieces he tries to ask me . " I deny everything . He seems relieved . But Mama wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps asking me questions . I am very sleepy .

His face is gray as a ghost 's and a vein pulses at the edge of his hair.  --  She has to be punished , Mama says.  --  Let me talk to her , he says .  --  There must be more to it than that . She 's confused.  --  Talk ! my mother shouts .  --  Give me the belt . " She yanks his belt free from all loops in one motion .

We would live together in the haunted house , keep all the doors locked , the windows closed , never go out , let nobody in , and let the green things in the yard grow higher and taller than Jack 's beanstalk . Edgar would be my giant , my god . I would worship him day and night . I would bow down to his marvelous marvel . I would keep him always happy . Then I sealed the letter and slipped out of the house to mail it . After the letter dropped out of sight and the red and blue box clanged shut , I remembered I had forgotten to put a stamp on it .

How to smile and talk and read books and listen to music . Everyone said how well I was doing and was n't it wonderful . Mama and Daddy were old . " I knew how to move and live like a shadow . Except that I was never there at all . Even the doctors never guessed that or knew where I was . I was far , far away , always a little farther . While a shadow fooled them all , I was elsewhere . Elsewhere I still lived in a dark garden . I cared for them all , the plants in my garden . Tenderly embraced them , clung to them , kissed them for joy and fainted again and again ... . " When Daddy died , only then and briefly , I rejoined my shadow . When we came back from the funeral , Mama went up to bed . I wanted to cry but had spent all my tears already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the vacuum bell with the bridal bouquet . I smashed it to pieces . Now ! I thought , now let 's see who 's a f raid of the fire . At last I 'm worthy of fire . In the kitchen I turned a gas jet high and thrust my hand into the flame and held it there without anybody making me do it . Then Clytie came in the back door.  --  Look Clytie ! I said .  --  I 'm not afraid of fire anymore . " She pulled me away from the stove and held me in her arms until the doctor came.  --  Baby , she said .  --  Do n't you lose heart . We are going to get you all well again soon . " It was n't a had burn . There 's only a little scarred place left to show for it . See ? " I show him my hand . He takes it lightly in his and holds it looking carefully . Then he lifts and kisses the tips of my fingers . " I remember you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a gal . A robe and a lunch ( and well , yes , she talked me out of a transistor radio too ) is cheap at the price . Not that I 'm much on dancing . Never could dance a step myself . And what 's worse , I could n't carry a tune in a five gallon can ( even on my harmonica ) . So when it comes to dancing , it 's just movement as far as I 'm concerned . Might as well be setting up exercises or something . Anyway this girl can move . Lord she can move ! And , tone deaf or not , I ai n't blind yet . I can tell a firstclass piece of merchandise when I see one and once in a while , if I 'm in the right mood , I can even appreciate something beautiful whether it 's got a pricetag on it or not . What gets me the most is the novelty . I built that old store and I 've sat in that office for many a year . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like mine is a museum . A man with any sense or any future would get shed of it in a hurry . The worst thing about getting old is how after a while anything new stops happening . All of a sudden you wake up and see it 's the same old thing happening again that did before and always will . You get in that frame of mind and you 're just a natural sucker for novelty and surprise . You keep waiting for it to come along , the way a young man waits for opportunity , to knock on your door and open up a sample case full of brand spanking new tricks like nobody ever even dreamed of . Nothing happens , so you put your imagination to work and picture something happening . That 's a temporary solution to the problem , like a painkiller . Trouble is you either run out of things to imagine or when some/thing new or interesting or unexpected happens it just ca n't live up to what you already imagined . I 'm telling the truth when I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gorgeous woman doing a dance like that in my office , turning and spinning , leaping and wiggling all different ways and even hopped up on top of my desk and tromped on all the invoices and letters with her bare feet . When she was done and took a bow I give the swivel chair with me in it a whirl and clapped for her until my hands were hurting . That old office will never be the same again . Neither will Mr. Percy either , I guess , judging by the look he gave me when I came out of the office and told him to wrap up the robe and the radio too . " Tell you what , " I say . " Why do n't you marry me and I 'll give you the store ? At least you 'll have the good judgment to get rid of it . " She 's sitting across the table from me spooning away at her chocolate sundae . She smiles at me and shakes her head . " You do n't even know who I am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll marry you and never even ask you your right name . " " You 're a character , " she says . " Tell the truth a couple of times and they put that reputationon you . " " Are you married , Mr. Loomis ? " " Yes ma 'm . Married thirty years to one woman , one good woman until she died . She died of cancer and took a long time doing it . A long time . . . . " Not days , not weeks , not months , but years . . . . They kept taking away parts of her , inside and outside , to keep her alive . I could n't even look at what they had left of her . I could n't even eat at the table with her . That 's how bad it was and I loved that woman . I tried , but all I had to do was to watch what was left start chewing and I had to run . At the very end , and even that lasted a good little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming . They tried everything they 've got to kill the pain until there was n't anything left.  | " She was a beautiful woman , " I say to her , " and she took a long , long time to die . " At the time I asked myself : If there is a God  --  and I do want to believe it  --  how can He let all these things happen ? Maybe He does n't know how it is . Let Him come down and walk through the hospital in the middle of the night and see how His children are faring . Let Him take a look at the Children 's Ward and see what 's happening there . Do n't come around telling me His eye is on the sparrow . When I think about all the suffering and the misery I 've seen all by myself and then multiply that by all the other people in the world and then multiply that by the number of generations as far back as you can go , then I , too , get a picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a globe , all eaten away like my wife 's face , a horrible hurt thing . I come in closer , focus down , and see it 's crawling with corruption . I put on my reading glasses for a real close look and now I see the whole globe is a muddy mass of human bodies all packed together and whirling in a dark empty sky . If there 's a God and out of His Will came this Creation , then I do not ever wish to see the face of the Creator . They 're wastingtheir time with prayers and hymns and organ music . They ought to be filling the air with howls and screams and curses until He ca n't help but hear us . And then if He wo n't listen , blow up the world . Maybe that would teach Him something . Or maybe not . The God I 'm thinking of now would just laugh . I mean , would n't that be a perfect ending ? Just the way He planned it . And would n't He be laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent over and lame , like somebody with arthritis in every joint , because I am so full of hate . If you get far enough along to figure out that the others , calling themselves the true believers , are true damned fools , then you ought to be smart enough to see that even the hate you 've acquiredfrom a little knowledge and a little experience is only part of His plan too . Then what ? What can you still do ? Go crazy or kill yourself , that 's all . Those are the only free choices you 've got from the moment they yank you out of your mother'sp95womb and slap the first of a long series of howls out of your throat . So I said no . No , Sir , no ! I wo n't settle for hate . If God is good , the way most people believe , or anyway tries to be good , means to be good , then He do n't need worship . He needs at least one day a week set aside for pity . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knuckle under and give Him what He needs . Do n't hate Him . Live , hang on , hold on to the last little bits and pieces , and spite Him . " Some people around here think I 'm an atheist , " I tell the pretty girl who 's still finishing her sundae , spooning away at the last drops of sweet in the bottom of the dish . " I would n't know about that . I reserve judgment . Agnostic might be the better word for it . Let 's just say I lived long enough to be skeptical . The older I get the more things I can doubt . And those I do n't doubt I do n't care nothing about anyway . " She 's looking at me with her hands folded in front of her . She 's got on one of the new dresses she bought from the store , and if it do n't quite show off her figure the way that red one did , well , I guess I know what she 's got already ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and she looks a whole lot " nicer . " Not that clothes do a whole lot for any of us , but it tickles me . Here in the space of , say , an hour I 've seen this woman in three different states , one natural and two artificial , and all three as different as can be . I do n't know which one is real , if there is a real one . But it tickles me that sitting across from me at the table with her hands folded demurely and listening politely to an old man 's conversation , wearing that nice print summer dress off the rack in the store , she looks every inch of her a lady , **25;6287;TOOLONG daughter ( could be my own ) . Like she never had a naughty thought or saw one ugly thing in her life . I could hug her . " Yes , " I say , " I was born to doubt . But right now there 's one thing I 'm sure of . " " What 's that , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sitting here talking , when I could be looking at you . " She has a pretty laugh , to go with the dress , I guess . A pretty , tinkling little laugh . Course she 's an actress , but talented . She 's come a long way since Sinner 's Revenge . " Laugh again . " " Why ? " " I 'd like to remember it . If you 'll laugh again for me , I 'll give you something , anything your heart desires . " She frowns and looks down at the empty dessert dish . " All right , " she says . " It will cost you another chocolate sun-dae . " " I 'll join you , " I say . " Even if it kills me . " I snap my fingers for the waitress and she laughs again even prettier than before . Judith " Clytie was the one who showed me your picture and told me about you . I looked at your picture and I knew you could heal me if you would . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back together again . " A doctor could only cure me by setting one or the other free . No one could heal me so they could all live together . Except maybe a man of God , some stranger chosen by God . " I studied your picture , your face , like a map . I looked at the eyes and I knew they had seen everything I had and much , much more . You were n't blind . You had n't turned to stone.  | " Clytie told me she was going to take her grandchild , a little crippled boy , to see if you could help him.  --  Take me with you , I asked her .  --  Please take me with you !  --  All right , she said .  --  It may not do any good but it ca n't do you no harm . RedThe rain came down that night . It blew up from nowhere . There had been clear skies all afternoon right up until sunset . Not a sign , not even a whiff of rain in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down , sheets and buckets . Raining bullfrogs . I was tired and my voice was almost gone and now I was going to have to shout over the patter of the rain on the tent . " I remember it rained that night , " I tell her . JudithWe sat in the back with the niggers . We were soaking wet and the sawdust was wet . There were lots of sick people and crippled people all around us . I never knew there were so many . They were the ones who would come rain or no rain.  |p98I  remember being worried about when it would be time to go up and get healed.  --  Do n't worry , Clytie told me.  --  I 'll let you know when the time comes . " As soon as you walked in and started to lead us singing a hymn , " I tell him now , " I knew you were the one to heal me . I knew it ! You had the power . " RedI too could feel it coming over me as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . It comes and goes like a fever . It waxes and wanes . You are nothing . You may be happy or you may be sad , you may be in a state of grace or crawling with the cruddy itch of sins . It does n't matter . It takes command of you . It is as if and much the same as when you feel your tongue turn into flame when you are saying , repeating the old familiar words of the gospel . You start a simple prayer with less thought than a man spinning a prayerwheel , or maybe you begin to preach , conscious only of the sound of your voice and the little signs of response in the crowd . When all suddenly , before you know it , you are speaking words of fire with a tongue of fire . All power is with you , all glory . And then you know that the words , the Word is real and for a little while you are permitted to be real too . " You had the power that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power . " I was singing the first hymn when I felt it . Thunder and lightningoutside and the old tent waving in the wind and my wordsp99dwindled away as if the breath were squeezed out of me by a huge fist . Raindrops fell from a hole in the tent and splashed in my hair . I bowed my head and tried to think of a text to meditate on , to pray on . For a moment the rain fell on me and ran down my face and my mind was a blank . Empty . My breath was all gone and with it my memory . My skull , inside , was a cave , a cell , whitewashed and empty . So empty a man could shout his name at the top of his voice and there would be no answer , no echo . The rain in my face tasted of salt , cool salt , rain and sweat mingling , and then the text , whether a voice in my ear or a great hand with a paintbrush daubing and scrawling the words across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt . It came to me from Mark , Mark who feared not to record the miracles and the hard sayings . You will find it in Luke and Matthew too , and perhaps most beautiful ( in our language ) in Matthew : " 0 my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me . . . . " But this came from Mark , strong Mark , the Lion . Think on this for a moment of time . Our Lord in the Garden of Gethsemane praying in vain while the others slept . And was n't this vanity , vanity , vanity of me to think on this now , to think of myself in the words of Jesus ? Then another text , also from Mark , but now as memory , a thought , as my mind came back and the vision of that white empty place faded , a thought in words and with words : And these signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; they shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover . " I remember , " she tells me now , " how you stopped singing and bowed your head . The others stopped singing too one by one . Some of them bowed their heads too and some of themp100watched you and wondered . Then you raised both arms high and smiled the brightest smile I have ever seen . " Praise be to God ! ' you said . The healing Power of God , the Son and the Holy Ghost has possessed my soul ! " ' JudithAnd then you said : " I am only God 's instrument , the least of his unworthy servants . But I know , I know I have His Power , His Presence , His Command to heal tonight . I can speak to you for Him . I can speak to you all  --  the crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deaf , all of you suffering . I 'm talking to those most pleasing to God  --  the broken in spirit , the contrite of heart .

Be happy and make God smile to see you . He has wept enough for one day . Come forward , bless you , all those troubled in body and soul and let God 's Power flow through my hands and make you whole again .... " You held out your hands in front of you and looked at them . Even in the back where we were sitting I could see them tremble . Then Clytie was standing , trying to help the little boy get up and slip into his crutches and get out of the aisle . I moved out into the aisle and waited while they passed him along . I waited to follow behind her , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little boy towards you .

" Then you opened your eyes to look at the boy , kneeled down in front of him and laid your hands on his head . Your lips were moving . You were trying to talk to him , but there was n't a sound except the rain on the tent . " " No ! " I say . " No , you 're wrong ! I was shouting at the top of my voice . Did n't you hear me ?

" We could all hear you then . You spoke to the boy . " I said : " Little boy , God in heaven looks down tonight on you . The Lord is looking down on one little crippled up boy with a black skin . He looked down and smiled at you and then He spoke to me . Said : Tell that little boy , the Lord said , tell himfor Me , My son , he 's My son and I 'm well-pleased , tell him he has borne his tribulation well . Tell him I do n't want him to have no more of tribulation . Tell him I want him to get well . It 's My Will .

" By God , he walked ! " I say to the girl . " He walked without those crutches . Did n't he ? "  |p103Clytie  , tears streaming down her face , fell on her knees and kissed his hands , the blessed hands that had healed her grandchild . He stooped way down and kissed her white hair . She hugged the boy and he was smiling . People were yelling and shouting and singing . Women fainted and grown men cried and called out praises of God . RedI stood up on the platform and looked , not seeing any of them . I have been lonesome all of my life , but this time , seeing it happenlike that , was the loneliest . All the noise and commotion was far away from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to toe . I wanted to laugh or cry but could n't do either .

" I knew you were there , standing in front of me , " he says , " even before I looked down and saw you . " " It must have been the perfume , " I say , " the cheap perfume . I borrowed it from Clytie . I do n't know why , because I had bathed myself and scrubbed myself as clean as I 've ever been . Maybe I was afraid that nothing would hide the stink of myself from you .

Took everybody for all he could get and had it in mind to hightail it out of the County . Bout that time somebody come along and swore out a warrant against him , and me and Jack jumped in the car and went down to the T.J. to arrest him . He was long gone , checked out , paid his bill , and everything . We took a look down to the Bus Station . He was n't there . Then old Jack got an idea . We hopped in the car and took off down the highway hauling ass . Caught up with him just this side of the County line . He 's walking along the road carrying a big old suitcase . Whenp118he hears a car coming , he drops his bag right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly smile on his face , and his hitchhiking thumb is about halfway up when he sees what kind of a car it is and who is in it . I 'll give him credit . He never lost his smile completely . It just kind of blinked off and real quick like a light bulb when something like a air conditioner cuts into the power . He did n't drop his hand , it just drooped a little . " I sure am glad to see you , Sheriff . " " How come ? " Jack says . " Somebody done switched suitcases on me . " " What did they leave you ? " He kicked the suitcase . " This old thing , " he said . " What 's it got in it ? " " That 's a good question , Sheriff , " he said . " I do n't know why I did n't think of that myself .

And he was thinking that it would n't feel good . And he was no doubt thinking from experience , boots of one size and another having been applied to him most of his adult life . " Why do n't you open it ? " Jack said . " I would just as soon not , thank you , " he said . " How about you , Rosebud ? " " It do n't make no difference to me , " I said . " What do you reckon we ought to do , Sheriff ? " " Well , " Jack said . " I 've been thinking here while we been squatting down . I always think better that way . The blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited about two or three seconds to see if either one of us was dumb enough to crack a smile . " We got two alternatives , " he said , " the way I see it . Ofp120course , I 'm always open to suggestions , but I can only see two . We can leave this suitcase out in the field and forget it . Maybe somebody will come along , you know , finders keepers , and pick it up and then it would be their problem would n't it ? " You should 've seen that fella 's face . Only expression I ever seen to equal it was a guy that got his skin caught in the zipper of his fly . He could n't zip up and he could n't zip down and he sure could n't go around like that the rest of his life . " What 's the other one , Sheriff ? " " The other what ? " " Alternative . " " Well , now , " Jack said , standing up and shaking the kinks out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can leave it safe in storage , all banded and sealed where nobody can open it and look . Then you 'll have a nice surprise waiting for you when you get out , like those toys they used to put down at the bottom of a box of crackerjacks and you had to eat your way down to get at ' em . Course there was always some damn fool that would pour out a whole box of crackerjacks cause he could n't wait long enough to chew up and swallow all that stuff . " " Get out of what , Sheriff ? " " The County jailhouse , " Jack said , serving the warrant on him . " Come on , let 's go . " That 's what old Jack did , too . He put bands and seals on the suitcase and put it in the storage bin for the duration . " What do you expect is in that suitcase ? " I asked him . " Money , " he said . " How come you did n't open it up and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If I opened that suitcase , I would 've had to take the money and give it back to the ones that lost it . " " You do n't approve of gambling ? " " They knew what they was getting into . I do n't like anybody , never did , that plays a game of marbles for keeps , and then when he loses starts hollering about it was all funsies . " " What 's the other one ? "  | " Put yourself in my shoes , " he said . " One of my duties is to run this jailhouse . Now , I like it to be nice and clean and quiet . I want all my guests to be contented . You think I want that fella moaning and crying around here for ninety days ? I 'd rather they lock me up and trade places with him . " So here I am , been playing poker three days running with the fella with my own deck and losing steady until this afternoon . I 'll give the fella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But along about noon today my luck changed and I 'm hot , baby , hot ! So come on cards ! Keep running ! Come to your old daddy ! Come on home ! " Rosebud ? " Come on Lady Luck ! Be with me now and I 'll be your slave the rest of my life . I 'll paint your toenails ... . " Rosebud ! " There stands Jack with his hat on his head , buckling on his belt , ready to go . " Where we going ? " " Out to the Fairgrounds . " " How come ? " " You 'll see . " I give that gambling fella one last look . " Do n't take it so hard , " he says . " It 's all in the breaks of the game . " I do n't even get a chance because Jack is already saying : " Do n't you lay a finger on the man , Rosebud . He 's a guest of the County and a ward of the State . " Lady Luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fella tell you how he really feels and you 'll do it every time ! You 're worse than my wife , Ruby.  |p122I  sit on the steps of the trailer , smoking a cigarette , thinking . I 'm wearing my shorts and a halter to keep cool . The tent is up now . The generator for the lights is all set up and tested out . Somehow between the two of them they put that portable piano together one more time . ( Moses can play it , but he sure ca n't put it together for the life of him . ) They got the card table set up under an umbrella for selling tickets . They got the hymn books all laid out ready , one on every other chair . They got the boxes of photographs of Red ( and me too ) ready to sell . I ca n't remember when we 've been this close to being ready so early with still plenty of sunlight left . Of course , they 're not completely ready . They 've still got to have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ropes are and if the stakes are all in deep and lined up even etc . And whose fault it will be if the lights go out or the piano falls apart . And who 's going to drive tonight if we go on . We 'll get to that shortly . Red 's in the tent alone with his Bible . This is his quiet time . He sits in a chair reading , searching for a text . Not really reading the words . Instead he lets them happen to him , sees them , his mind takes them and drops them like coins into a well . He 's listening for the splash . What he 's really doing that way is asking himself again and again can he do it , should he do it , is he able . He 's wondering , if , when he gets up there and starts to talk , God will strike him deaf and dumb . Meanwhile Miss Nympho Bitch-Little is inside the trailerp123rummaging through my footlocker and my costumes , looking for one to wear for tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the act too and I 've got to figure out something she can do and not look like a fool . Well , when it comes to skits and routines , I 've got a million . And if I do n't know one already , I can make one up . Right now she 's having herself a ball trying all the different costumes on like a little kid playing in Mama 's closet . Mama 's tired right down to the tips of her toes and Mama 's tired of kids and costumes and skits and almost everything . She is trying to kill me with kindness and sweetness , that girl . Well , I can play that old game together with the best of them . We went in the trailer arm in arm , giggling , like a couple of girls going off to the Ladies Room to compare notes on our dates . We got in there and she looked all around at everything oohing and aahing . Like I had asked her into my living room . It was so cute , clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Honey the times I 've been on a yacht , it was n't clean , it was n't neat , and it was n't a bit cute . They get you far enough out so you ca n't swim and then it 's every man for himself . ) Then she took my hand between hers and looked me right in the eyes . " I know we 'll get along , " she said . ( Sure we will . Because the day we do n't one of us is leaving . ) " Yes , " I said . " I hope we will . " " It 's so important , " she said . " I know what you mean . " I pulled out the footlocker and opened it up to show her the costumes . You would 've thought I was opening up a jewel box full of treasures . She clasped her hands together ( bites her fingernails ) and sighed . " They 're so pretty ! " " They 've seen better days , " I said . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , cause we 're two entirely different sizes and you stand to lose if you walk out there in a costume fitted for me . Not that a few laughs would n't pick up the show. )  | " Help yourself . " " Any of them ? I mean , do n't you have one you want to wear ? " " I 've worn them all one time or another . " So she turned her back to me and slipped out of that black trenchcoat . That surprised me ! I just did n't figure her for the kind to run around wearing a trenchcoat and that 's all . She has a kind of a slim , long-legged figure a little like Brigitte Bardot in the movies , suntanned all over , just to show off , I guess . Then I saw the marks of the pine needles and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing . That old Red ! Would n't you know ? Well , at least she was flat on her back . " You try them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you prefer . " She turned around halfway to smile thanks to me . ( Well , Sweety-pie , you may never win a booby prize , but at least you do n't have to worry about sag . ) And I smiled back and left her to her fun . I wish I had thought to bring the transistor radio with me when I left . But I 'm not going back in there and have to talk to her to get it . She raps on the trailer door from the inside . " Everything all right ? " I say . " It 's awfully hot in here , " she says . " Is there a fan or some way to open the windows ? " " Turn on the air conditioner . It 'll work in a minute . " Then to the two of them , standing by the tent , arguing over a tent stake : " Hey ! Put on the generator . " " Are you crazy ? " Cartwright hollers . " The lady in the trailer says it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , if old Hookworm just had a halfway decent set of teeth , he 'd be perfect for a pimp . Next time we 're in Galveston I 'll plant the seed of that idea in his head and see what happens.  | " Take care of it , will you ? " he tells me . " While I get this stake in right . " " There 's nothing wrong with that stake . " " Do you want the whole tent to fall down ? Is that it ? " " A hurricane could n't blow this tent down . " He leans on the sledge and grins at me . If you look very hard and very closely , you can see what might pass for a flicker of cerebral activity behind his eyes . " You still do n't know how to start the generator , do you ? After all this time . If you had the mechanical sense that God give a low-grade moron . . . " " Show me . " " Hey ! " Miami calls . " Do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pants on ! " Cartwright yells back . He goes over and gives it a couple of tries . It sputters and dies on him . He starts cussing it , and this time when it sputters he gives it a hell of a kick and it catches . Naturally he almost busted his foot . So he 's hopping up and down still cussing through gritted teeth and Miami 's laughing herself sick . " What 's so funny ? " he says to me glaring , hopping toward me , still holding that foot in his hand . " I 'm not laughing . " " You were too . I saw you . " " I do n't like to see anybody suffer . " " Especially you , " he says . " For you work is suffering . " Now the first smarting of pain is gone . Gently he lowers thep126foot to the ground . Tests it , gradually increasing his weight on it , looking down at it intently . Now takes a step . Another . Looks up and grins with pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see people suffer and I do not like pain , the sight of it , or my own pain ; but Cartwright 's snaggletoothedgrin presents me with an intricate moral dilemma . In my heart of hearts wo n't I have to concede that if it comes down to pure , simple and absolute choice , I prefer the vision of Cartwrightholding his foot and hopping around , his whole face screwed up into an eloquent expression not only of anguish , but also of the brutal injustice and ingratitude of inanimate objects , to the other  --  Cartwright of the Indescribable Grin , Cartwright rampant , triumphant ? " I guess we know who you can depend on around here , " he says . " I guess we do . " " Did you watch how I did it ? Do you think you could start the motor all by yourself now ? " " Maybe , " I say . " But I 'd rather not . " " See ? I knew you was no good . " Ah , Cartwright and the idol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emptiness . Cartwrighthas taken all kinds of extension courses to improve himself . Courses of every conceivable kind . Those being advertised in the back of magazines . He has studied : piano , guitar , and accordion , electronics , how to be a real estate broker , meat cutting , how to turn songs and poems into dollars , how to be a detective , commercial art , hypnotism , how to earn Big Money , how to repair any watch or clock , how to make any window into one-way glass , photography , how to investigate accidents and sell shoes , how to write shorthand , be a fingerprint expert , plastic sealing and laminating , how to use a transistor metal detector to search for buried treasure , drawing , how to be a motel executive , welding , body repair , air conditioning and refrigeration , karate ( including a life-size practice dummy only 990 . He has even written to the Rosicrucians for " A Secret Method for thep127Mastery of Life . " He is keeping the secret well . He has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , has practiced judo and jujitsu , dynamic tension and isometricexercises ; he has credentials and the documents to prove that he is a trained detective , a television repairman , a famous author . Miami has lately been urging him to learn a new language , preferably Swahili , a suggestion which inevitably touches two delicate nerves which , struck like guitar strings , evoke sounds of rage and irrationality  --  the niggers and the United Nations . Now he stands and looks at me . " I ca n't hop around on one foot as well as you can . " " That ai n't all you ca n't do as good as me . " We now shall , no doubt , resume the subject of the tent . " You were in the Army , were n't you ? " he says . " Yes . " " I bet you had one hell of a time in the Army . " " That 's a pretty accurate description . " " Did n't they even teach you about tents ? " " They tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about tents than you . " I avoid bringing up his carnival days at this point , a digressionwhich prolongs this argument to a point beyond endurance . " What 's wrong with it ? " " Look at it ! " he says . " I guess it 's about the worst-looking tent I 've ever seen . " " It 's going to be dark outside . Nobody will even see it . " " It 's the freaking principle of the thing ! " " Speaking of principles , Cartwright , I 'd like to say here and now , that it offends me to see you , a business manager , performingmanual labor . " " It ai n't always going to be like this , " he says . " Really ? " " The trouble with you , Moze , is you got no vision of the future . " " Do you think things are going to change ? "  | " Listen here , " Cartwright says , " I know how it looks now . It do n't look too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict the day will come when we 'll have dozens of young strong men  --  full-time , permanent , high-class roustabouts  --  working for us , putting up tents two and three times as big as this old thing . Ten times as big ! Brand new tents , air-conditioned , capable of seating thousands at one time . We 'll have loudspeakers and a portable pipe organ . We 'll have a choir and maybe even a big brass band . People like brass bands . And when we come rolling down the highway it wo n't just be one dusty trailer and a half-ass truck that you can drive right by without even noticing . When we come down the road , it will be a procession , a convoy of trucks and trailers with a police escort . It will be a parade wherever we 're at . I know the day is coming when Big Red Smalley 's Old-Time Tent Revival Meeting will be famous and celebrated from coast to coast ! " " How about Europe ? " " Why not ? Asia , Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paris , " I say . " That would suit me fine . " " What 's so special about Paris ? " " You know what I mean . " Glimmers now , begins to glow in his eyes , shows also in the sly snaggled smile that spreads as if reflexively , and all of this ending in a wink ( blatant as a slammed door ) and a laugh ( the snort of a horse ) , Cartwright 's expression of subtle , awakening feeling , the feeling of mutual , shared , complete conspiracy of something not evil ( he wards off that word by deleting it from his dictionary of practical usage ) , not vice ( because , for him , that 's a tool you use and a metaphor for what you get them caught in ) , not even frailty ( for that connotes something else , perhaps like the teacup and saucer he will never learn to balance on his knee ) , but what he persists in calling his Weakness . " Moze , " he says . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with women ? " I say , a picture of righteous indignation.  | " Nothing , " he says quickly . " Do n't you want to go to Paris someday ? " " Sure , but ... " " Why ? " I demand . " To see the Eiffel Tower ? " " It 's just that I never did expect to hear you come out in favor of  --  you know  --  sex . " " Maybe you never really knew me , " I say . " Maybe not . . . . " " Stop for a moment to consider , " I say . " We 're different , it 's true , we dress differently , talk , think , act differently . Our pasts are remote and alien to each other . Who knows what the future will be for either of us ? " He opens his mouth to make a sound , meanwhile protesting with both hands . " No , " I say . " We may be as different as night and day , but we have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too am a man . Do you imagine seriously that I am immune to the pleasures of beauty ? Do you think that you alone , of all living creatures , have suffered the pangs of desire ? " He pauses for due consideration . " I 'm glad you said that , " he says . " I never thought of it exactly like that . " " Well , " I say , addressing him with the saddest expression I can muster , " when a man reaches a certain age . . . But there is one thing they can never take away from us , the boundless , limitlessfreedom of the human imagination . That is the answer ! Grow old with me and so forth . Cultivate a full , rich imaginativelife , Cartwright , and you 'll always be a happy man . " " Is that a racial characteristic ? " he asks , puzzled beyond either malice or irony . " What I mean is , do most Jews as a rule have a good imagination ? " " I would n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about you ? What do you dream of ? Where does your imagination roam ? "  |p130Ah  the smile again ! The wink that bangs like a loose shutter in the wind . " Do n't be shy , " I say . " We 're all big boys together . " " Well , " he says , " the truth is I do think about women a lot . I mean , they give a fella a lot to think about . " " Indeed they do . " " I guess I think about women most of the time . " " You 're young and red blooded . It 's natural . " " That 's the way I look at it , " he says . " How do you picture them ? " " Well , it 's kind of hard to put it into words . " " Try , " I say . " Every man has some vision of how he would like the world to be if he had the power to make it that way . Some men dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes , cheered by the adoring crowd . Some dream a peaceablekingdom where the lion and the lamb can lie down together . I suppose there are as many kinds of dreams as there are men . " " You mean if I had my druthers . " " Yes . " He concentrates . I wait . It would be a lie not to admit that it gives me some satisfaction to tease Cartwright , to expose him , if not to himself ( and that is his redeeming core of strength , God 's gift to fools : he will never know . . . ) at least to me , a reminder that for all his narrow , small minded , smug offensiveness , he is a pitiable wretch . But it is a small pleasure and less satisfaction to be reminded of the obvious . No , there 's a reason , a simple , defensive reason . If not this , then the tent . Otherwise we will continue to argue and fuss about the tent until night falls . " You 'll laugh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not laughing now . " " Well . . . the way I see , it 's kind of like a wheat field . . . a great big rolling field of wheat as far as the eye can see in every direction . Only , see ? , it 's not really wheat . It 's women . A wholep131godamn field full of naked women just smiling and swaying in the breeze ... ! " " Where do you fit into the picture ? " " It 's like I am the owner , " he says . " Like I 'm the farmer that owns the field . " " Sounds beautiful . " " Yeah , it 's great . I mean , it probably sounds crazy to you . . . . " " No , " I say . " I understand you . " Then his whole expression changes . Without warning his eyes go glassy like a punchy fighter 's . His knees sag . Breath , not words , explodes from his lips becoming at last a kind of choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a striped car , its small red rooflight catching the sun , turn off the road and under the arch and head over the field towards us . I glance back at Cartwright , but he 's already halfway to the trailer , bent low , hunched and bent at the knees like an infantryman under fire . But not running . He goes with a kind of quick , stealthy walk which suddenly reminds me of Groucho Marx . CartwrightMiami , coming up off the stairs of the trailer , walks right past me saying to herself : " He turned out to be a dirty old man after all . " Which do n't make a bit of sense , but I 'm not stopping now to ask her what she 's talking about or even slowing down to think about it . It 's up the stairs and inside quick , shutting thep132door behind me , able to breathe again anyway , leaning against the door and listening . If that 's old Dreama , sitting in the back of the car with murderin her eyes and legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello ! " If a man could really jump right out of his skin and run off and leave it , I 'd be the one . Then when I turn around and the first thing that hits my eyes is skin and the flashing of sequins , I 'd faint dead away if I could . " What 's the matter with you ? " It 's the girl , the godamn girl . Only she 's done shed the raincoatfor one of Miami 's costumes . In which , making allowance for her size and shape , she do n't look too bad , not bad at all . " Scuse me , ma 'm , " I say . " I forgot there was anyone in here . " " Do you like it ? " " Yeah , " I say . " On you it looks great . " " Why are you whispering ? " " On account of , " I say , keeping right on whispering and hopinglike hell she will too , " the po-lice has arrived . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . " But I ai n't taking no chances . " She wrinkles her forehead , wondering . " I do n't want to get caught with this on me , " I say . I have n't got time to explain all about Dreama , and anyway that seems to cause women to bust out laughing when I tell them . I got another reason which is just as good as Dreama . So I open my coat and show her the .45 pistol stuck down inside my pants . " Oh , " she says , looking at it . Then she gets that frowny , puzzledlook again . " Why do you have that ? " " We take in a good deal of money , " I say . " You know , contributionsand offerings and so forth and so on . " " What kind of a gun is it ? " " It 's a Army surplus item , " I say . " Here , have a look . " I hand it to her . " Oooh ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p133Then  she 's got both hands wrapped tight around it and her hand over the trigger and the barrel is pointing straight at me . " Bang , bang ! " she says . " You 're dead . " " Be careful , lady , " I say , trying to sound calm , cool , and collected , so as I wo n't frighten her into accidentally squeezing that trigger and blowing me straight to kingdom come . " The sonofabitchis loaded . " " Oh , " she says . " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't never point a gun at somebody unless you 're fixing to use it . " She stops pointing it , lets it dangle loose in one hand , but she do n't offer it back . " Tell you what , " she says . " I 'll keep it for you . Then you wo n't have to worry about getting caught . " " That 's mighty kind of you , ma 'm . But I do n't think that 's such a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if it was to accidentally go off or something ? ' What if you just happened to hurt yourself ? I 'd never forgive myself . " She turns her back to me , picks up that black raincoat and fumbles in the pocket . She comes up with a whole fistful of green bills . " I 'll buy it from you , " she says . " You name your price . " " Why ? " " I do n't know , " she says . " I never owned one before . How about two hundred dollars ? " " That 's mighty generous , ma 'm , " I say . " But you 'd be getting robbed . " " I do n't care . " She means it . She 's made up her mind she wants that gun and she 's going to get it . And I do n't like it even a little bit . I mean , I could use two hundred dollars , and if I wanted guns I could get a arsenal of them for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're just kidding me , are n't you ? " " Make it two-fifty , " she says . " That 's how much I 'm kidding . " I knew she was crazy all along . I mean , you start giving gunsp134to crazy people and then look out . If that girl has a gun , somebodyaround here is liable to get hurt . I do n't care about the rest of them , but I do n't feature getting cut down by a .45 . That thing makes a hole as big as a fist and there are n't too many places on one man 's body where he can stand a hole as big as that being added . Anyway , she might kill herself , accidentally , or on purpose . What if she was to aim at one thing and hit another ? She might take a shot at one of us and miss and hit somebody else . With my luck that 's just what would happen to me , gunned down , shot down like a dog , poor boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot at . " I sure do appreciate your offer , rna 'm . And do n't you think I do n't . If I was to sell that gun to anybody it would be you . But that gun is kind of special , you know . It 's got like sentimental value . " " Do n't give me that shit . " Well , what do you expect from a crazy person ? She sits down on the bunk and looks at the floor . " I wonder what would happen if I pulled the trigger right now. , , She looks up right at me with a great big smile , the happiest smile in the world . " Ca n't you just see all the police and everybody running in here . " " Do n't even think like that ! " " What would you say ? " " Are you crazy or something ? " " I 'm just crazy enough to shoot you right now . " And right then up comes that barrel pointing it at me again and she 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger . The barrel is very steady . " I flipped off the safety , " she says . " In case you 're wondering . " The smile is gone . In that costume of Miami 's , with all that red hair falling over her face and the gun pointed right at me , she looks like some kind of a monster . Like she turned into a monsterright in front of me.  | " I wish you could see yourself , " she says . " You look scared to death . " I ca n't work up enough breath to make an answer , even if I could think of one . " Come here . " " Lady , " I say . " Listen , Lady , I 'll give you the gun . I 'll pay you to take it off my hands . I never did like guns anyway . Only pleasequit pointing that thing at me . " " Come here ! " " Pretty please ? " " I 'm going to count to ten . One-two-three-four . . . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . " What do you do ? " " Who me ? " I say . " I mean , what do you mean ? " " Around here . With the show and all .

We go ahead and make arrangements , business things . . . . " All the time she is inching to her left down the bunk very slowly , sliding down the bunk towards me and I am inching to my left , trying to do it so slow that it wo n't look like I 'm moving . She 's smiling , looking right into my eyes like she 's listening , even interested . Her left hand is free and her right hand is up against the little flat bulge of her stomach just below the navel that 's got a rhinestone winking in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at me . About this time I am up against the wall . " Is that all ? " Her free left hand moves over and kind of tickles me . NaturallyI ca n't help twitching a little bit . " Sensitive ? " " I 'm a little bit goosey , Lady , " I say . " You 're sweating , too . " " It 's a hot day . "  | " The air conditioner is on , " she says . " Do n't you feel it ? " She leans across and kisses my ear . She lets her tongue aloose to run all around in there . I try and sit very still with both my hands on my knees , looking straight ahead . I figure she 's going to blow my head off any minute now . " What else do you do ? " she whispers in my ear . " Different things , " I say . " I used to look after the snakes when we had ' em . " " What did you have snakes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them get so worked upwhen they get saved , they like to have snakes crawling all overthem just to prove it .

And anywayI have me some stuff to give ' em that will make ' em all kind of sleepy and relaxed . " " Do you like snakes ? " " Not specially . I mean , I can take ' em or leave ' em , " I say . " Please ma 'm , do n't do that . " On account of her left hand has done strayed up just enough where she 's fixing to cause me trouble and embarrassment . " You know what you are ? " " No , ma 'm . " " Trash , " she says . Zip goes the zipper and I feel cool air , only I do n't intend to look and see if what I feel is really so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " But it ai n't a nice thing to say to a fella you do n't know well . " " I 'm not a nice girl , " she says . " Are you comfortable ? " " No , ma 'm . " " Get comfortable . " She gives me a pretty good shove , I 'd say , for a little thing , and I kind of topple back on the pillows of Red 's bunk . " Ai n't you got no shame at all , woman ? " " Nope , " she says , curling up close beside me.  | " What if Red walks in here right now ? " " I 'll kill him , " she says , putting the point of the pistol on the bridge of my nose between my eyes and leaving it there . I sneak a cross-eyed look at it . It looks terrible . It do n't feel too good either , kind of cold and oily . " Do you ever perform ? " " I ai n't got a whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too bad , " she says . " I used to whistle pretty good . You want me to whistle you a tune ? " Then she busts out laughing right in my face , laughing so hard I 'm scared shitless she 's going to forget and squeeze off a round . Right between the eyes . The last thing I 'll ever see of this world is the face of a crazy woman laughing at me . Well , we all got to go sometime and I 'll be a sonofabitch if I 'll let her laugh me to death . " What 's so funny ? " " You 've still got your hat on ! " Sure enough I do . " Excuse me , " I say . " Did n't your mama teach you to take off your hat when a woman gets in bed with you ? " Sheriff Jack StarrHere comes a fat one that looks like an Arab or a Jew . " Afternoon gentlemen , " he says . " Are you the one they call Red Smalley ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " I was fixing to say you do n't do a lot of justice to your picture . " He tries to smile . That 's all he can do  --  stand there and smile . It 's kind of a weak smile , but you have to give him credit for trying . " You do n't look much like a preacher neither , " I say , still looking him over , not looking at Flowers when I say : " Do he look like a preacher to you , Rosebud ? " " Not like a Christian preacher , " Rosebud says . I climb out of the car and square my hat and hike up my belt . " Course you just never can tell nowadays , " I 'm saying . " The way folks advertise things is a crying shame . " " He has a new picture of him made every year , Sheriff . " Rosebud gets out on the other side . First thing he does  --  clink , clink  --  is shake his pants leg . Rosebud was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of wearing boot chains inside his britches , still wears ' em bloused like that over the top of his boots . Likes to look sharp in his uniform . I can see what he 's got his socalledmind on . There 's a woman strolling over towards us . " He 's got more nerve than I do , " I 'm telling the fat guy . " I wo n't let nobody come near me with a camera . " " Yes , sir , Sheriff , " he says . " I know what you mean . " I just bet you do , you little old fat ugly man , you . You 've got yourself a great big round belly and a face like a jack-o ' - lantern . Kind of a fella it would be a pleasure to put on the road gang for thirty  --  sixty days and see if you just do n't melt and disappear in the hot sun . All that would be left of you would be them suede , nigger-style shoes . Kind of a soft , sneaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to boot in the butt . " How many more of you are there ? " I see the trailer , the truck that looks like it would n't make it from here to the highway , and the big old Buick they must use to pull the trailer . Over across the field , under the trees , the sun blinks off of the paint of a sports car . " Just the other manager , Mr. Cartwright . " He would be the one that took off quick as he saw us turn offp139the road . A man that runs that quick ai n't got nothing worth hiding . " What 's that over yonder ? Looks kind of like one of them foreign cars to me . Belong to you ? " He does n't look when I point . He 's got his eyes right on me . " No , sir , " he says . " It belongs to a lady . " " This one ? " pointing at the woman with the skim milk complexionand the way of handling what she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lady either . " No , sir , " he says . " A young lady who drove here to see ReverendSmalley . " " People come from far and wide to see a preacher , " I say . " Sometimes they do . " " Rosebud , " I say . " Take a run over there and check the license on that car . " He is making the acquaintance of the woman , got his hat cocked a little , talking to her and she 's smiling and listening and looking at him with those big baby-blue eyes . " Take the lady with you , " I say . " Maybe she 'd enjoy taking a ride in a police car . " I turn back to the fat man . " All right , " I say . " Where 's he at ? " " In the tent , " he says . " I 'll go get him . " " Do n't bother , " I say , starting for the tent . " He 's meditating , Sheriff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll only be a little while and then he can meditate all he wants to . " Inside the tent it 's shadowy after the bright sun , and hot , too . It 'll be hot tonight too . Some people do n't seem to mind the heat when they come to one of these things . Like some of them have got to get good and sweaty before they can start to feel religious . There he is , sitting down at the far end , reading his Bible . Big enough too , big enough and redheaded enough to live up to his name . Reading along slow , word by word , following his fingerp140across the page , moving his lips too . Well , I guess he can read anyway . ' Which is a damn sight more than most of these travelingso-called preachers . " How do , " I say . " Are you L. J. Griggs ? " He looks up quick and surprised , even mad for a flash of a second , mean-looking . Only a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light on the badge and the butt of the pistol , and the broadbrim hat and already he 's blank-faced , wary , on his feet and fighting a reflex to reach for a hat he is n't wearing and yank it off his head . Somebody trained him a long time ago . " Hello , Sheriff . " " Starr 's the name , Jack Starr , County Sheriff . " We shake hands . He has a heavy-boned , strong , calloused grip . " Is your name Griggs ? " " I have n't got anything to hide , " he says . " Yes , sir , that was the name I had before I got the call . " " Still is , too , ai n't it ? " " I guess you 're talking about in a courtroom with a judge and a lawyer and papers and so forth . " " That 's what I 'm talking about , " I say . " Big Red Smalley is the name I go by and work under . " " Like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place . The Smalley part was a mistake . First time I ever preached a tent meeting we borrowed some paper fans , like we always do , from a funeral parlor . The fans had SMALLEY printed on both sides in great big letters . Some people naturally took it for granted it was my name and the name stuck . The other part was bound to happen . I kind of acquired it as I went along . The first time I recall anybodyreferring to me as Big Red , like it was my real name , was in Murfreesboro , Tennessee . " " Now tell me something , " I say . " This L. J. Griggs , the one you used to be and still are as far as the Law is concerned , did he ever get into any trouble with the Law ? " " I do n't deny I 've got a record , Sheriff . My past ai n't no secret . It 's an open book . I read it and weep . But that man you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a figurative sense , he 's dead and gone . Saint Paul tells us all that we must put off the old man and put on the new . That 's what I did . He also said , Thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die . . . . ' So , in a way , you might even call me a murderer . I killed L. J. Griggs . And I dug his grave and buried him deep . " " I can see you 're familiar with Scripture , " I say . " I read my Bible too even if I do n't make my living at it . Right now I 'm making my living and I want to get a few things straight . This Griggs has been busted on some pretty serious charges . " " He did his time , did n't he ? He took his medicine . He took the worst you people could hand out and come back for more ! " " Take it easy , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always worse . There 's no man alive that ca n't be broken down to jello sooner or later . We could break you . If I was a cruel man I could make you curse God before morning . And do n't think I 'd mind doing it either . I 'd like to see just how much faith you 've got , you paid preacher , you jailbird making your living claiming to be a preacher of the Lord . Like to see how long it would take to turn you against Him . " The last time I ever saw Griggs , " he 's saying , " was in the jail at Fort Smith , Arkansas . I walked out of there and left him to rot . " " Facts , " I say . " Facts are my business . You ca n't convict a man figuratively in an imaginary courthouse and send him to an imaginary jail . " " Good men , Sheriff , better men than you or I , have acquired a police record . Saint Paul himself was thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ was hauled and dragged up in front of a magistrate by the name of Pontius Pilate . That 's in black and white too . You might even say Jesus Christ had a police record . " " You might , " I say . " You got a point , too . I might even agree with you except I did n't get called or chosen for my job . I got to stand for election every few years . "  |p142He  laughs at that . He 's got good teeth or else a damn good set of false ones . His curly hair shakes when he moves his head . All those little curls , a head of hair that looks like some kind of a wig and is n't . And the eyes . Green , pale green with a strange light in them , a light without a source . They cloud over and then clear again . He sees you , but he 's really looking at something else . Not in the tent or the field or the County . Maybe not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it 's a dream or a fact , when you kick a rock you stub your toes and it hurts . He may be looking at some place where you kick boulders like footballs and never feel a thing . It is n't the first time I 've seen a light like that in somebody 's eyes . I have seen it in the eyes of men wrapped up in straitjackets , foaming at the mouth like mad dogs . " Sheriff , " he says . " I know you 're a busy man . " " I wo n't be long , " I say . " I 've just got a couple of questions . " " Ask me anything you want to . " " What are you doing here ? " I say . " All we want to do is hold a religious service . " " There 's plenty of places . Why pick this one ? This is only a little old town dying on the vine . There are n't enough souls worth saving for you to even slow down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have a tent meeting . An old-fashioned revival . My only plan is to preach the word of God . Is that a crime around here ? " " No , sir , " I say . " I guess you could say we tolerate the word of God as much as the next place . " " What 's the problem , Sheriff ? Will you just tell me that much ? " " That 's why I 'm here , " I say . " You hold your meeting . You sing and shout and pray and preach as much as you please . That 's your privilege . This spot is County property , but you 're welcome to use it . You have your revival and then you pack up and get out of here and do n't ever come back . You hear ? " " Yes , sir . "  |p143Now  he cuts his eyes away and looks down at the ground . That 's all I wanted , I guess . " Do I look like a rich man to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living off the fruits of the land ? Why do n't you look around you ? Take a look . This is all I own in the world . I do n't even own a blade of grass . All I want and all I need is enough strength to keep on doing the Lord 's work . " " You 're either a liar or the luckiest man alive . " " You do n't give a man much choice . " " You made your choices a long time ago , " I say . " Why do n't you come tonight ? " he says . " Why do n't you come and see for yourself ? " " I guess I 'll have to get along without it . " " Are n't you a religious man , Sheriff ? " " Let 's say I do n't feel the need of a circus tent . " I start back up the aisle , knowing he 's watching me , following me out with hate and anger burning him alive . I stop and turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait until he answers to that name if it takes until Judgment Day . " Yes , sir ? " " You do n't have snakes with you , anything like that ? " " No , sir . " " You sure ? " " You want to see ? I 'll show you around myself . " " I 'll take your word for it . " I step outside the tent and stop a moment to mop my brow and breathe the fresh air . I take a look at the mountains . Well , they 're still there . They have n't moved one inch . I go back to the car . There 's Rosebud standing with his hat on the back of his head trying to sweet-talk the woman . She 's heard it all , boy . She heard all the sweet talk there is in the world while you were still running around in diapers . Here comes the fat man running up , all smiling again , to open the door for me . I get in.  | " Rosebud ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here . " He hops in behind the wheel . He gives a little wave to the woman and she gives him a smile and a nod , then he scratches out across the field . As we get to the arch , he flicks the switch that sets the red light blinking and cuts on the siren full blast . We make a squealing turn . " What do you think you 're doing ? " " Giving the lady a thrill , " he says . I twist my head and see the three of them standing in front of the tent , the big one shading his eyes against the sun to watch us disappear . " Cut it off ! " " What 's eating you ? " he says . " Why do n't you shut up and drive the car ? " Miami " Where 's Judith ? " he says , not even looking at me . " In the trailer . " " Go get her . " Out of the trailer comes old Hookworm without his hat on and looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right past me . Does n't even see me . He says " Je-e-e-e-sus Christ " to himself and then takes off at a dead run across the field for the woods . I go inside and there stands Little Miss Nympho Bitch in front of the mirror . She 's got that black trenchcoat on with thep145collar turned up , and she has on Cartwright 's hat and it 's pulled down . She 's got his pistol in her hand . She turns and sees me and smiles . " How would this do for a costume ? " she says . " I could be a lady bandit . " " It might be a brand new way to take up the collection . " " Do you think I 'm silly ? " " Red wants you . " " What for ? " " He did n't say . " She tosses the hat and the gun on the bed . She slips out of her raincoat and looks at herself in the mirror like she was the first woman in the world . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself it would be the most , the end , the book of Revelation . I got news for you , chickie-babe . You would n't like it . " What do you want me to tell him ? " " Tell him I 'm taking a shower . " And with that she slips into the little cubicle shower and draws the curtain . " Be careful , " I say . " Do n't use up all the water . " On the way out I take the clip out of Cartwright 's .45 , empty it and then put it back . She can play with it all she wants to now . Moses is waiting for me outside the door . " You better talk to him , " he says . I can hear Red inside the tent cursing and yelling and throwingthe chairs around . I go quickly and stand in the entrance of the tent . He 's throwing the chairs all over the place . " Godamn ! " he yells . " Godamn them to hell ! Sonofabitches ! Godamn their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes a running start and knocks down a whole row of chairs . I laugh as loud as I can and he stops and looks at me . " Godamn you too ! " He comes toward me . I pick up a chair in both hands and letp146him have it over the head . The chair splinters and he sits down , dazed , shaking his head . I kneel beside him and hold his head in my arms . " You 're going to have a lump on your head , " I say . " But it wo n't show . " " Call it off , " he says quietly . " I ca n't do it . " " Never mind .... " " I wo n't preach in this god forsaken place . " " Everything 's going to be all right . " " One of these days I 'm going to kill you , " he says . " You may not get a chance . One of these days you 'll wake up and find me gone . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be the day ! " We stand up and he brushes the dirt off himself . He looks around the tent and shakes his head . " I guess I kind of made a mess . " " I guess you did . " " Listen , " he says to me . " I 'm sick of the whole thing . I 'm sick to death of everything . I hate them all . Why do n't they ever leave me alone ? " " I 'm not too enthusiastic about cops either . " He turns to me and lifts my face in his hand , looking into my eyes . " Miami , " he says . " You 're a good old girl . " I wait for him to kiss me , hoping he will now , knowing his need . It 's all I can do for him . Maybe all I 'm good for . " Where 's Judith ? " " I was wondering when you 'd get around to that . " " Where is she ? " " Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know , " I say . " Maybe she likes to be clean . Maybe she likes to feel all clean and fresh . " " What do you think , Miami ? You think a shower bath would make you feel clean and fresh again ? " " We 're two of a kind . We belong together , Red . "  | " Speak for yourself , " he says as he walks away . At the entrance of the tent he turns around with a big smile . He throws up both hands in the air like he was preaching and his voice booms out and fills the tent . " And it came to pass in the eveningtide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of his house : and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself ; and that woman was very beautiful to look upon . " " You 're forgetting the important part . " " What 's that ? " " David was a king . " " Well , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You better hurry , " I say , " before she uses up all the hot water . " I set up a fallen chair and sit down in it . I feel like crying and I might even do it . Except I used up all my tears a long , long time ago . Is n't that something ? Ca n't even cry when I want to , when I need to , when I really feel like it . Ca n't even cry . Anybody can do that . It does n't take much talent . It 's the easiest thing in the world . " Can I get you something ? " Here 's old Moze , good Moses who ca n't stand to see anybodysuffer . Moses , you overstuffed , ugly clown , you good , goodman . Now I feel them . You see ?

Smiling and crying at the same time . " I never was so sure of anything in my whole life , " I tell him.  |p151Now  it is late afternoon and the shadows of the western mountainsfall , splash , and spread dark stains across the patterned pines and fields of the valley . As if the Flood were coming on , steady and sure as those shadows . Soon they will all be drowned and from the bottom of a deep sea look up where stars bob and wink like buoys , far , far beyond the reach of townsman or traveler , remote , indifferent to their unheard cries , supercilious as the lanterns of Noah 's ark , riding the crest , floating calmly towardsArarat and the inevitable , beautiful assignation of the clove and the olive branch . Meanwhile each is alone with himself , with heart and guts , with the long pilgrimage of blood to nowhere and back , with memories ( a tribe of ghosts ) , with hungers , furies , fears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations like a slide rule , with imagination which is at once the hunter and the hunted , and with the soul ( wherever it is ) speechless , naked , and perhaps in chains , yet dreaming always of a purity so dazzling clean and shining it would strike mortal eyes blind to behold it . Behold then Cartwright , hatless , disheveled , sore distressed , as he crouches on all fours and stares into the pale eyes of the sports car.  |p152But  as for me , I am a worm , and no man ; a very scorn of men , and the outcast of the people .

He is left there , hopping on one foot in a little circle near the wounded car , a mad dance which only the car itself , one-eyed , but unvanquished , views .

Then dropping to the level of the field , move in a smearing rush through the jungle of grass , seeing as the ant sees , hostile , infinitely dangerous and without limit , the field still brilliant , dazzled , crazed with sun . Above clear air waves with a vague presentiment of coming dark . Cut now and follow in air the ribboned gray-white streak of a mockingbird , flash and flutter , rush , zoom , sweep of wings from the trees to the tent , coming to rest on the ridgepole and pausing there , wary as a weather vane , head cocked , a gray-white parody of an old-time preacher in a frock coat , listening , observing , then gone again toward the far trees . Drop from the top of the tent to one who rests in the shade of the truck , leaning back against one of the great smooth tires . The camera comes now for a closeup of the face . The man in the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cornersof his eyes crinkle into crow 's feet , against the gray smoke of the cigar and the blaring , blazing Technicolor of the ever/fading sun . He is thinking not of himself now or the truck he leans against or the tent or the mountains or even the town called High Pines , out of sight . Thinking instead in a free , easy flow of images , a vague and uneasy blur of himself younger , so long ago it seems now , seeing it without pang or pain , sorrow or guilt , merely as something that happened to a young man long ago in a story he barely remembers . MosesDeliver my soul from the sword , my darling from the power of the dog . A deuce and a half comes down the rutted road fast , bumping , boiling dust behind it .

Only they do not see that , men in back , packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy in all their newly issued gear , helmets jouncing with each bump . They see the dust behind them and the field growing wider and longer under the half-oval of the tarp . Then the truck slowing , double-clutching as the gears go down , grindingand growling , and the field behind them is gone . Trees are all around . The truck stops . Someone calls his name . He rises , fat and clumsy then as now and always , looks briefly at the row of faces on the bench opposite , deadpan faces of strangers all turning the light of their eyes on him . He tries to smile , knowing it is a weak one , a poor meaningless little hail and farewell , then bent low , but not low enough , for he strikes his head on the overhead rib ,  |p156his  grin more foolish now , as if in apology , and heavy and awkwardsteps over the strap and the tailgate dropping down , landinghard , stumbling , pitching forward as the truck moves away behind him . His helmet rolls , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting his head which is now light without the weight of the helmet , looking up past the tips of a pair of boots , up past faded fatigues , buckles and buttons into the high far face of Master Sergeant Elwood Roberts . The lips are grinning but the little eyes are bloodshot with rage and fatigue . " Get up , you pig , " Roberts says . Then gathering his gear , he stumbles through the trees , past strangers in foxholes . Roberts all the while talking , speaking tono one and to everyone : look look boys what they done sent us they call it a replacement for Christ 's sake a warm body I call it a big fat slob Jesus what next ... . Soon he is standing before the Captain , Captain Saxton , once a southern gentleman and now a lost soul , a thin man , grizzled , needing a shave , chainsmoking , his blank eyes ringed with black circles .

Also a unit citation and a bronze one for the taking of that village . How would Roberts tell about the taking of that village ? I wonder about that and can hear his words , too , telling it if he could :  --  It was near the end of the war , I think . We was thin then , very thin even with new replacements . The whole thing was it broke up the meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . We was back a ways and lazing around and just started eating chow when the orders came down . They all bitched naturally , but I got them on the trucks and the Mess Sergeant said he would save the food because it would n't take long.  --  Saxton was dead then and we had this new Lieutenant but he was n't no trouble . The whole thing was simple . Two villages . We would hit the first and hold and Charley Company would come on behind and take the second one . We would have some help from heavy weapons but no artillery , but that did n't matter because they had already scouted and the word was how they only had a few old men and some kids holding the village and the mortars and thirty calibers would scare the shit out of them.  --  We got up there and had good position and concealment . Some woods and then maybe a couple hundred yards of ploughed field . We got right up to the edge of the woods without seeing nothing moving . Heavy weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a snap . Maybe that 's how come I got nervous . The Lieutenant he wanted to hit and get it over with but I said at least let 's see can we draw some fire , I mean there ai n't no ele/ment of surprise because they bound to have heard the trucks and all of us moving in the woods.  --  Okay , he says , but hurry up.  --  So I put a few guys out into the field just stooging around and sure enough we drew fire but it did n't amount to nothing just a couple of rifles and they could n't hit a barn.  --  See , the Lieutenant tells me , we 're just wasting time.  --  I wanted to believe him and he looked to be right but I was twitchy anyway.  --  He give the signal for heavy weapons and the thirties opened up and mortars laid in and we jumped off running . I guess we was about halfway across the open space and had n't nobody even been hit when the first man went up with a mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose . They had us in a crossfire and zeroed in perfect and they laid mortars behind us in the woods to keep us from going back and to keep Charley Company down . So there was n't but one way to go and the quicker the better . We could n't just mill around and get killed so we run for it through the mines and made it , too , by God , and took the town . Except , of course , it did n't happen that way . Roberts stepped on a mine and went off in the vivid air in screaming butcher 's fragments and so did so many . We took the village , true , and there were eight of us alive at the end , all of us wounded . They had a full strength company of S.S. there but they pulled out when we finally got in the streets . I lay on the street bleeding and sick at my stomach . It got quiet . Then I heard a noise in the basement of a building nearme . I thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to killme now . I crawled up close and started tossing in grenades . I heard the screams when the first one went off , but I kept throwinggrenades until the screaming stopped and I could look . They were all children , school children bunched together in that basement . I remember I got down the steps and kicked open the door and I must have fired a full clip before I saw what I was shooting into.  |p160I  woke from that nightmare from time to time in hospitals of which I remember nothing . I remember only the end . Night and the highway . A tent by the road . I must have gone first for the tent . It looked like an aid station . I went in and got in line . When I reached the front I kneeled down like the others had done and I looked up at him and started to cry . " Do n't send me back , " I said . " Please do n't send me back . " He put his hands on my head . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to go back . " How I got there I do n't know . It must have been strange , though , a fat , balding man in hospital pajamas and bathrobe entering the tent from the darkness outside to be healed or , if not healed , then freed . I have remained by choice in bondage ever since . If I leave him I know those children will find me . But never here . They will not look for me here . I am alive and am still breathing . I have learned and know a few things worth knowing . I know that pain is bad and life is precious . I curse nobody , being drained of curses . This is an Assault Company , by God ! over those wide fields , through trees and deadly streets of villages , towns and cities I ran and I run still , bent low , forward , not backward , holding my weapon , until my times comes . Asking for nothing , not even silence , peace and quiet , or the grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then howl I will . If there is a time and place beyond time and place , perhaps we shall all meet again and I will allow myself to grieve and will be allowed to ask for mercy and forgiveness . I will bind together those shattered fragments with kisses . I will help you find the lost pieces Master Sergeant Roberts . Then we will hold hands on that twilit playground and be permitted to join in the games . We wo n't have to be afraid anymore . The Captain was right . We only die once . They can only kill us one time.  |p161Now  to the tent , a cave where a woman sits alone on a chair , rubbing Noxzema on her shoulders . She is sunburned from the folly of standing in the sun too long with the young , muscleheadedDeputy Sheriff . She could do that much for him , then , keep the young one preoccupied with her attention . I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint ; my heart also in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to do now is wait for dark to come . We 'll hear the sound of the first car or pickup truck coming , all jammed with its scrubbed , damp-haired cargo of a country family in clean clothes . Then a sound in the tent like the buzzing of insects . Rising and falling . Inside the smell of humans too close together . Finally Moses at the piano and the music begins . They quiet down , waiting . At last he appears , tall , broadshouldered , serious . IIe opens his mouth to sing . His voice trumpets in the tent and they all rise to sing too , following him . He will smile then to encourage them , nod , and to many it will seem that sudden smile is a sign of God 's love . Now I try to be empty . Not to think . To wait . But have never learned that trick of thinking of nothing at all . I try to think of something funny to kill the time . Gags and one-liners , I know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flesh andp162spirit , I know books , absurd desires , crazy positions , and rituals more foolish in word and deed than any Hottentot 's . But not now . I keep my secrets , some of them anyway , like a priest , a doctor , a lawyer , an Indian Chief . I 'm in a mood for less than truth and more .

He looks toward the tent with wonder and compassion , thinking : poor girl howcan she a whore-horse ridden by all untamed &; ever unable to be tame or tame herself endure ? Now to the house where Howie Loomis lives , once a fine house , a showplace in High Pines , a sagging hulk in need of paint , in need of glass for the windows , a place where loose blinds flap like broken wings in the wind . Inside he sits among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the last afternoonlight filtering through the west windows . He has a bottle of whiskey and drinks in spite of the Doctor 's orders.  |p164All  they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul . Sure , I 'm getting drunk . Drunk as a skunk and who cares ? Not me . If it be not now , it will be , and if it be not to come it will be now ; readiness is all . They wo n't find me for a week and wo n't I be something to look at then ? Wo n't this old house stink ? Or maybe I 'll just wake up in the morning with a hell of a headache and have to begin again . Back to the store at least clean again and wait for the Angel of Death to show up like a timid salesmannew to the territory . I came back to the store feeling good , feeling fine . In the officeI sat down in my old chair and smiled . Full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head on the desk amid the invoices and letters her bare feet had trampled , and I dozed . Closed my eyes at least and seemed to doze . I will just run back the reel on that dance , I said to myself , just to be sure it 's all there and that I can summon it up until the day I die . Now begin , sugar , dance like you danced for me ! my wife my beautiful wife young again is the dancershe dances I sigh with relief &; she will do a striptease but how not having a fig leaf left to take off begins a striptease of flesh of skin coyly peeling instead of clothes parts of herself my wife is dancing to music of screams but smiling &; smiling &; peeling until I gag &; can not bear to look stop please stop dancingGod make her stop please stopI woke covered with cold sweat . The first thing I did was reachp165for the phone . After that I blundered out of the store and walked home not seeing a soul though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and enemies . To the Fairgrounds again . Off the highway and under the arch , across the field to the trailer . Where the man sprawls on the bunk , spent , empty , limp as a drowned man tossed on the sand by the tide . His eyes are closed . He reaches for something . The girl standing beside smiles offers him her small , thin hand . his closes over hers , powerful enough to crush the bones to powder , but lightly , gently . She sits down on the edge of the bunk , holding his hand , and looks at his face . There is a faint smile on his lips as he breathes deeply and begins to sleep . JudithSave me from the lion 's mouth : for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns . All day long he stumbled towards sleep not able to find it . Now he sleeps like a baby , smiling . I did that ! I charmed and enchanted the giant . I look at him in wonder from the soles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . I could kill him now in his sleep . Carry his head proudly as Judith took the head of Holofernes back to her city . What if I carried it back to John in a little canvas bag . " Here , John , here 's a souvenir of my trav/els . " Or I could snip off his hair like Delilah and put out his eyes . Then he would always need me . He would lean his weight against me . I would spoon him his food . I would teach him to dance and do tricks like a bear on a chain . I stand guard over him , holding his limp hand lightly , looking at him and wishing my eyes were hands and mouths . See his face in repose is like a child 's , unlined and untroubled . I have the power to put him to sleep . I can erase lines from his face and give him the gift of silence . I will keep him safe always . I have power and he has the power also to wake me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an orchestra tuning &; tuning waiting waiting he arrives &; raises his baton I follow his least signal to make musicI am a wild horse &; he the riding master boots &; spurs &; riding crop I balk &; buck but he breaks me breaks meteaches teaches till I jump high leap through rings of fire for joyI am the puppet &; he the masterhe jerks a string another I dance dance all splintery &; mywooden throat screams joy joy &; my glass eyes cloud with tears he bends my body like a bow I cry out until his arrow sings tothe target 's shiny eyehe maketh of me an harp strung with fretted nerves plucksthem each &; all together &; of my shrieks makes harmonyonce I was a tree but he touches me I shudder out of bark leaves birds fly &; roots ungnarl &; I am flesh again holy flesh ... . o my beloved comes brighter than morning dew to my little gardenhis eyes are cruel as hawks his hands are pairs of white dovesI am not milk and honey I am bitter &; more secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose like dew I drink &; drunken open openhe is the hawk &; I the dovewhen we lie together he is the lion &; I am the lambhe is the sun &; I am the moonI am the water he turns into winep167listen o my beloved I will bathe you with tears &; clothe you with kisses always alwaysNow it is twilight . The sun blows a last faint echoing trumpet call behind the western mountains . The light is suddenly bleached and vague . We are at the bottom of the sea . The dark flood spreads . There is a sudden startling quiet . Then the noise of crickets tuning . Moses , behind the small , satisfactory glow of his cigar , mops his brow with a neatly folded square of handkerchief . He slaps a mosquito on his arm and stares at the blot of blood among the dark hairs . Then there is the sound of an engine groaning on the highway . He listens to it strain and cough , then looks out across the darkening field to see the headlights flick on and grope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low gear , heavily loaded , feels its way toward the tent . He drops his cigar and stamps it out , even as he does looking up into the sky to see the first pulsingof the evening star like a small , good diamond in the light.  |p171I  am on the platform looking into their upturned faces , listening to them sing an old gospel hymn and singing along with them . Not just to lead and direct them note by note , but so I do n't have to listen myself if I do n't want to . There are many inequities in the Lord 's gifts to his creatures , but none so radicallydifferent to my way of thinking as the human voice . God or some absurd combination of genes and chromosomes gave me a good one . A man takes his own gifts and attributes for granted . A man judges from his own gifts , feelings , habits , ideas and ideals . It 's the nature of a man to do so . A virtuous man , a good one , will see good within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man will sniff the stink of himself behind the charity of a saint . Maybe that 's why they say a bad man makes the best Judge . Since every Judge I ever come up before was a first-class sonofabitch , I must 've come before some of the better jurists . Maybe that 's what God intended , too . For every man to be bound and shackled in the prison of himself and his own little padded cell of self-knowledge . Else where would you ever get sheep and goats ? Else where would the inexhaustible supply of Suckers come from ? Let copulation thrive and let one be born every minute . Adam was the first Sucker . And ai n't we all a bunch of the same ? I knew a crippled girl once who could sing like an angel . Ap172voice so sweet and clear and pure it would break your heart just to hear her . People used to crowd the church to hear her sing and she sang for every wedding and funeral for miles around . It is the nature of the beast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tears . She led them to Jesus . Look what Jesus gave that poor little old girl , they said to themselves . He 's bent and twisted her body like a root in the ground , but he gave her the voice of an angel . So , you see , there is Justice . And that girl , God knows and I know it too , had a heart as cold and hard as Italian marble and the compassion of a rattlesnake . She would have clapped her hands for joy to see us all tortured , broken and twisted one at a time until we were all so misshapen , distorted , deformed that she alone was beautiful in the world . Our tongues yanked out with pliers from the roots , our eyes gouged out , so she alone could sing and we could only listen . I look down and see Moses plunking away at that two-bit piece of a piano as solemn and serious as if it were a piece of real music . Moses , he can play Bach and Mozart and Debussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I keep him playing crap . And , you know , it tickles me  --  he 's come to like it , too . I see E. J. Cartwright , Elijah Cartwright In Person , as absurd in his choir robe as a clown , singing away to beat the band , his eyes roaming easy like a pair of trained doves all around the tent to gently undressevery halfway decent-looking woman in the tent . I saw a stripper one time who used a pair of trained doves in her act . They fluttered around her and were trained to peck at and undo the knots that held her costume together . I keep Cartwright around to remind of a simple fact . Call him a fool if you want to . Fool is what he is all right . But I reckon if I was ( were if you insist on grammar ) John Bunyan I 'd call him Mr. WorldlyWiseand be done with it . Here I stand looking at this little field of folk , the same faces , always the same faces , hating and pitying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more verses to go and I 'll tip old Moses a nod and away we go . Get the show on the road . Oh , they 'll getp173their money 's worth all right . More than that probably . Because I do n't feel the least twinge of regret . And that 's a blessing . All day long , with the usual nonsense going on all around me , I 've been looking for a text to preach . I like to have thumbed that Bible to death . I 've read the great and the famous ones . I 've read the hard sayings . I 've read the easy ones that any halfbaked , country preacher could make a four-square shouting sermonout of . And I 've looked at obscure ones it would take a poet to translate . I 've meditated , memorized , contemplated . I 've waited for a sign . I 've closed my eyes and pointed blindly , jabbed my finger into the middle of random verses thinking maybe , Las Vegas style , I 'd hit a row of oranges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tinkling cascade of silver dollars . But all the words were stale and gray and finally only ink printed on a page , little squiggles like the tracks of a lizard in the sand . I had a fury within me all day long , a fury of frustration . I was still looking for a kind of rough and ready Justice . I was using my mind . I figured this : God chose me . He made me a preacher when I did n't want to be one and when I knew better . He even took all the joy out of it . Because I knew , I always knew I was just as good and just as successful , maybe even more so , when I was faking it , playing the part , being the pure con man pure and simple , as when He grabbed hold to me , as a cat grabs a mouse in its mouth , and shook and rattled my ribs and timbersuntil I thought every bone would snap like a matchstick . Cat and mouse , that 's us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of Him because He always had His ways of letting me know I was only on parole . He would be back to claim me again and use me again . And nothing I could do would ever set me free of Him . I could n't do anything bad enough . Naturally I could do something bad enough in the world to get myself slapped in jail . But a cell is no place you can hide . I could get myself strapped in the electric chair and the last thing I would hear would be His voice in my ear . Well , a man can get used to almost anything and a rare wisep174man can even start to like it , choose to , by free choice make not only a virtue but also a pleasure out of his necessity . If that 's the limit of freedom , then you can reason yourself into the simplerecognition that it 's better than nothing at all . But that wise man all by himself is still a fool if he forgets about God . God can take even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would go on the same way world without end as long as forever , and I 'd just as well get used to it . Even my own rebellion , in the profound delusive hope that He would just leave me alone ! even all that would go on just as steady and regular as clockwork , the tick and tock of an old-time railroad conductor 's well-kept gold pocket watch . That 's bad news , when you think about it , to know that even your resistance , your rebellion , your blasphemy , is part of the program . My solace and my consolation was the fact that after some hard times I knew . I knew the score before the end of the game . And there was and is no way , better or worse , to change it . Even that desire was part of the plan . But , you know , I actuallythanked God for slacking off on me that much , enough to let me figure it out on my own . I told myself , all right I can take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally letting me know I do n't need You that much . I 'm at least free enough to take You or leave You . This morning I woke up empty . I knew He was gone from me , maybe for good . The world looked all young and green and beautiful again . Gone for good . I 'm free ! I could have jumped and sung and danced for joy . I was n't even awake good , though , hearing them squabble among themselves ( and for once to me it was music and I would have run out of the trailer and kissed all three of them for love and charity to share my joy ) when a cold notion flew into my brain and squatted there like a buzzard , patient , in atree : He 's through with you all right , but what makes you think he 's going to let you walk away ? I mean , it 's like you have beensick , weak and delirious with a high burning fever for as long as you can or care to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You lay there and you want to smile . You would kiss the Head Nurse , tough as the hide of an old alligator , toprove you love to be alive . You raise your hand to clench a fist , and you ca n't , and all of a sudden you realize that the fever has gone , but so has your health and power . I woke up then , sat up thinking : What if the power is gone ? I do n't mean His power . I mean mine . What if He decided to let me be , but to let me know He had been here awhile , He snatched away the only gift I 've got . What if I ca n't preach no more ? Just when I should be able to make something out of it purely , without His static or interference , He took that away from me too . Would n't that be the last laugh ? I was afraid to stand up for fear He had left me , as He did old Samson once , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was afraid to look in the mirror for fear He had given me the face of a monster . I was afraid to think about anything for fear He 'd snatched away my mind . Why not ? Did n't He do that to Soloneon , the wisest of men ? I would be laying there yet , I guess , paralyzed , a statue , if I had n't realized that I still had the freedom to find out . I still had that much . So I reached for the bottle and I took a drink and it felt all right . I jumped up and ran outside to give them three fools of mine a trial by ordeal , a little dose of hell . That would be a fair test . They would smell it before it was even an odor . They would sense the rot and decay within me before the first sign of it showed . And they would rise up and rebel . They would want their freedom , their simple worldly freedom from me ; and if what I feared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even asking for it . Miami would know . If I had been robbed of what had been given me . If God had decided to play Indian Giver . Then she could have the one thing she 's been waiting for , the one thing she thinks she needs . She could pity me . She could comfort me . She could cuddle and pamper me like a baby or a basket case . And I thought , as I tested her , studying her for any least sign , what if God just took one power away from me ? If He blastedp176and wilted my tool of sex , the one sweet solace of oblivion , the one little death I can die again and again and defeat at least the surprise if not the pain and fear of His last victory over me . Then for the first time in her memory she 'd anyway have the excuse to be chaste . Miami should have been a nun . She missed her true vocation by a hair . Perhaps His plan was to deprive me of even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a gradual , piddling diminution of ability and power , so slow as to be hardly noticeable , so gradual as to be only another illusion , able easily enough to be construed as merely the inevitable cumulative effectof age , decay , degeneration , and God 's other democratic gifts to all His creatures . ' Where will the mind wander when it leaves the tedious dying flesh ? Does it soar into new heights and atmospheres ? Does it turn to some ancient conventional wall to wail ? Or , taking Hookworm as a model , does it toss and turn buoyed on the soft , lukewarm seas of impossible pleasures , a dream of the final and complete gratification of all our insatiable hungers ? Will it , like Miami 's , grovel among shameful memories ? Or like Moses be wounded not once , but again and again by the same blows ? Or maybe like the sick mind of the girl , Judith , it will writhe forever on a single bed of nails , naked , spotlighted . . . . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me then at that moment in the morning sun , standing among my little trio , my private trinity of the utterly defeated , that it might have been part of God 's final plan for me that , worst of all , I would never know for sure even that . He had left me , but how ? Was He finished with me or would He add to my natural share of woe , by adding to the needling of doubts , the decay of knowledge and awareness and at last even of memory and the desire to know ? I was lost . One by one I tried to cut the strings that made me jerk and dance . One by one I tried to cut the strings by which I , in ironic parody of the Master , jerked and danced my little trio of lostp177souls . Better : as if holding a bright bouquet of gas balloons on strings , I , one by one , freed them to rise and soar away , leaving me at least with empty hands . Then a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurd girl , flaunting her celebration of folly in the trail of exhaust and dust behind the car . We talked and I remembered the time and the healing . A night for me terrible and magical . For truly then , as before and since , truly God had passed a portion of His power through my hands to heal . I had truly known the ineffable radiance , the terrible presence . Yet she had returned , one dark shard of a shattered night . To perplex , to baffle . Maybe to mock . I could hardly be said to have healed anything at all . For she too is lost , and utterly lost . And I thought to myself , this is what it comes to after all . This is all that it adds up to in the end , all that any of it means ; and all my works have come to ashes and dust . Then and there , like dawn , a new light touched me . The messageof her presence was more subtle . God sent her to me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life , but also as a sign that I was truly free now , free even of any good works I might have wrought in His name . Free to live until I die like any other creature . Free also , like any other creature , at last to let go , to doze and dream into a peaceful madness or to destroymyself . He was restoring my simple humanity to me by takingaway , now that He had wearied of me , my past life . Not allthy sins are forgiven , go and sin no more , but instead : all your works of days , all your gifts , all your blessings are removed , erased , and all your sufferings amount to nothing and all your life amounts to nothing and I leave you as I found you nothing and I take from you even the desire for My love and forgiveness and I not only banish you from My sight I banish mercifully even the memory of Me and the need for Me . Now I would preach again . Now I could preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could , without emotion or feeling or regret or the deep doubts of a true believer , preach the gospel , coldly , using only my mind , my voice , my training ,  |p178my  experience . I would preach better than ever before . With the Word gone for good , I could be master of little words and the letters that are said to kill . And I turned to my Bible , to the words and the letters . To find a text to preach . The words danced and blurred and swam without any meaningat all to me . It might as well have been Chinese . Then came Caesar to torment me . As if the panic itself were not more than torment enough . My past rose up and spat in my face . Ha ! God had taken away His part , freed me from that , but returned to me my past . Returned me the world . How like you this ? Which , of course , was irony to remind me in the form of a smartass country john-law what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my worldly credentials are . Suppose He had told Peter that after the cock crowed three times he would find himself magically and untouched right back where he started , hauling in fish ? I went to the girl again . Found her pagan , Greek , a nymph of Diana , corrupted , singing and swaying in the shower . She was beautiful to look at . This too was a sign , the last one it seemed . I had only to bathe with her , to purify myself in a new baptism . I laughed for joy and , tears of relief in my eyes , I crowded into that tiny shower stall with her . Not even stopping to remove my clothes . Laughing , gritting her teeth she fought me , but I mastered her until the two of us sank , contorted , to the tin floor to finish in a unison of spontaneous animal cries long after the last of the water was gone . My clothes ripped to shreds and the soap already drying on both our bodies . Now I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more frenzy . No more doubts when there is nothing left to believe in . I look into their faces , their hopeful faces , knowing what it is they want and need to hear and knowing that in perfectly calm lucidity I can preach to them exactly that . I stop singing . I nod to Moses that this will be the last verse and he signals with a slight tip of his head . I listen to them sing now . Oh , wasp179there ever such a cackling of crows ? Have a flock of starving crows staring with malicious eyes over glazed winter fields ever sung more beautifully ? Long live crows ! God must have loved them because He made so many of them . The hymn is over . I bow my head . A hush fills the room until the loudest noise is my own steady pulse . I raise my head and toss my hair and smile my best and brightest.  --  I got news for you all ! I come all the way here to High Pines to bring you a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I speak . And what do I see ? Old people , already sickened and weary of the bodies they have to live in , tortured by self-disgust , by the rot of regret that gnaws the vitals , regret for the inevitable things done and left undone ; lonesome , too , and tired , tired of the world and all its mingling of the habitual and the marvelous ; the old , they always come , partly out of the bitter hope of hearing something that may give them at least briefly the strength to accept their dying bodies . Cruel involuntary will to keep on drawing in oxygen and casting out carbon dioxide , asking not ease or even much relief , but only some words of comfort like candy they can suck or chew on in the bad times they are going through and the worse times they know are coming . Afraid , too . And why not ? False comfort from false comforters to tell them nothing is as bad in fact as it is imagined to be . Stupidity of false comfort . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way . Oh , you can be robbed or reft of poor reason by pain , drugs , fright , or even the fierce fist of the unconscious squeezing the brain out of shape as a sculptor molds a chunk of clay . But who can deliver us from imagination ? And then what comfort from a young man to an old one who has already felt the thorn in the joint , the first pains testifying to the long slow pain of dying . The old with their hearing aids , glasses , false teeth , trusses , crutches and canes , their slowly cooling and congealing blood ? Also the young , but not many . These are the young who have already suffered in mind , body , or spirit too much to be truly young . Who see only a waste of years ahead to hobble across ,  |p180but  because of the limits of the human imagination ( mercifullyit has limits ) do not know the truth of that waste , can not conceive the world of the old to be contended with ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with the whole stupid business . Who would blame them ? A few young girls , as always , feeling the first female hunger of sex ; knowing , but not knowing truly yet , the pain and agony of childbirth . Wanting but fearing the inner shudder of total release , the pleasure of abandonment , wanting that , but fearing to want too much lest , vulnerable , they be deprived of even that . Some , maybe most , ignorant , ashamed , disgusted with themselves , confused , tormented , knowing truly only the undeniable burning and hunger . The halt , oppressed , crippled , lame , blind , spastic , deformed . How many freaks do gather together in Thy name 0 Lord ? Hoping without hoping to be healed and whole . Cursing the healthy and lucky , yet unable to enjoy the purity of hate , having been commanded to love , having been told that life is or can be good . Forced to curse all those for whom life seems to be good , but forced also to reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily , even by smiles and comfort , deeper into the lonely labyrinth of themselves where they know , without knowing , that a great beast yawns and waits for them . And the poor . Those with no more really than sparrows , for whom each day is an effort not only to keep alive , but to conserve , as if misers , the pittance of strength and energy they possesselse they will be too weak , unable to rise up the next day and struggle to keep alive . Crushed by the world these poor whom God said He specially loved . Few , if any , of the rich , the healthy , or even the good . For why should these come crawling to Him ? To speak of Justice : He wraps them in mink , in the fat of health , success , virtue . They do well . They live well . They do not need Him , not with the easy hunger of these whom He has selected to be His losers . Then are they damned for their good fortune ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But consider the limits again of thep181human imagination . How can it picture or create that which is not ? The human imagination creates only from what is . God alone can create out of nothing . So here I have one shabby tentful of the world 's shabby secondsand rejects . I seek out a dying town , a brackish stagnant pool with lost creatures thriving in its slime , and it is my knack to try by words and images , tricks of logic and disputation by tickling their sensitive feelings and raw emotions , to try by all sleights of hand I can muster to delude them into believing , however briefly , that some of their intolerable burdens are , will , or may be lifted , that maybe somehow they will someday be able to live with themselves . Is it any wonder I have to hate and despise them almost as much as I hate and despise myself ?

But maybe it is n't foolish . Experience teaches us to expect bad news from a bad world . So with trembling fingers you rip open the envelope and read ... .

The sender has no clue what the message means . Nor does he know if it is received . Neverthelessp182it is his duty until power and energy fail him to send forth coded gibberish , cryptograms merely decorated with stock phrases and platitudes . And it is his duty to believe that somehow , quite beyondany known power of comprehension , all this can be transformedto sense . Maybe music is the closest analogy . Made up not just of the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts , oh hardly ever acceptable , but also of all thoughts , all memory , all fears and wishes , more frantic than a whole sky of startled wings . And not only that , but all else we know and do not know we know , all that we suspect , all that we dream and all the stuff not even dreams can be made of because it is so secret . It is the bounden duty of the sender to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did get a Western Union telegram . What would it say ? Hey there , Belshazzar , I got a message for you .

" With no question of fidelity involved he had yet been faithful to Annabella Crowe for nearly five years . All during that period he had known that Mrs. Crowe was going to bed with  --  as well as he could figure out  --  three other men and possibly four . But he had known this from the beginning , and he neither felt jealousy nor expressed any desirefor exclusive rights to her services . The machinery of a regulated need and its satisfaction created neither lasting gratitude nor masculine vanity nor any other item in the stuff of love . Spontaneity was , of course , entirely absent because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the business of hiring out her lovely body that she could not more effectively havep101thwarted romantic notions . After an hour in bed with a man she would sit in her wrapper , holding his folded banknotes in her hand as he dressed , sometimes fanning herself with the money , sometimes using it in gestures , chatting amiably until it was time to lead him to the front door and close it behind him for the night . But the sexual act with Adelaide was so unlike the brief , calculated meetings with Annabella Crowe that it was a relationship and not a transaction , similar only in the union of their bodies . There was never , when a variation was tried , the suspicion that the variation had originated with Adelaide and another man . It was all , all new and unique with Adelaide , and here was the beginning of love . Abraham Lockwood chose to think of himself as a man of experience , but for the first time in the more than thirty years of his life he was living with a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage it was still the larger experience of living with her , and the marriage as a personal institution gained and was strengthened , and finally becamelove . When it happened Adelaide knew the difference , but she made no comment . She only loved the more . Abraham Lockwood 's mother died of weariness a few weeks after Rhoda was put away . Weariness , some shame , uselessness , hard work , an uninspiring future , a too demanding past , and , on the death certificate , quinsy . It was not an easy death , to strangle slowly and look into the eyes of husband and son and read so plainly their wish to have the laborious breathing come to an end . Within a week Moses Lockwood had pleaded successfully with Adelaide and Abraham to move into the red brick box , and there , in 18.73 , their son was born . He was called George Bingham Lockwood , in honor of the Governor of the Commonwealth , who was a close friend of Levi Hoffner 's . HEN George Lockwood was about five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's health was bad . He had become so enfeebled that he seldom made the effort to walk the few squares to his office in Dock Street , and business matters that requiredhis attention were taken care of at his desk in the den in the red brick box . All of his day was spent in the house or in the yard . He was up early in the morning , and the servants who were hired soon after his wife 's death took turns rising at five o'clock to get him his tea . On fair days he would be out in the yard , carefully dressed in thep102clothes he might wear for a business day , and walking a few steps at a time , from rose bush to elm tree , sometimes touching the petals of a rose , sometimes studying the tree from ground to topmost branch , pausing to rest in the rough-hewn oaken chairs and benches that were strategically distributed about the yard . On days when rain or snow or bitter cold kept him in the house he would walk about from room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of porcelain , and often colliding with a servant on her cleaning rounds . The household was now a busy place , with Abraham and Adelaide and their two young children , and the two servants and nurse , and a coachman in and out of the kitchen ; and yet wherever Moses Lockwood went in the house he would bring quiet with him ; his entrance into a room would suspendconversations and the people would wait respectfully for him to tell them what he wanted ; but most often there was nothing he wanted and he would take their continuing silence for the dismissal that indeed it was . Moses Lockwood did not like the coachman , Rafferty , who made him feel on visits to the stable that he was spying . Moses Lockwood was thus deprived of the company of the horses , of which he was not over-fond but which were at least living beings and would hear him if he said a few words . Abraham Lockwood , the only survivor of the four human beings with whom Moses had passed most of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone for the day , fairly frequently gone for two or three days with his new interests in Philadelphia . Adelaide Lockwood , a pleasant little piece , had the children and the household on her mind , and she would almost never spare a few minutes just to sit down and converse . The servants were a pair of colored women , sisters , from Richterville , and they had a way of looking at a white man who conversed overlong that told plainly and embarrassingly their suspicions of him , although he was sixty-five years of age and weak in the knees . There was only one person in the household who had any time for Moses Lockwood , and that was his grandson , George . And what with the new baby and his mother 's preoccupation with it , and his father 's being engrossed in his business , the boy and his grandfather were mutually interdependent for stimulating company . The old man told stories , semi-inventions out of his early past , of which the boy soon had several favorites and in which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departures from the original versions . ( " Grandpa , you told me the Indian had a rifle , but before you told me he had a tommyhawk . Then you shot him . " ) The differing versions and the boy 's corrections made the storytelling sessions into a game , and the old man began deliberately to introduce new details into the basic stories to challenge the boy'sp103alertness . Momma was Momma , Poppa was Poppa , but Grampa was Grampa , the storyteller with the funny ear and fascinating spitting and interesting sore on his left temple . ( " Did the bullet go through your ear and then they cut off the bottom part ? Or did the bullet shoot it all off ? " ) Sometimes they would go to the privy together , the old man sitting on the elevated hole , the boy on the lower , smaller one . The boy would finish his business quickly and watch while his grandfather strained and grunted . ( " Wait outside , boy , this is going to take a little time . " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man could eat with him . The old man could not bite into an apple , but he would peel one with his pocket knife , in a long continuouscurl , and cut the apple up into small bits that they would share . Always there was something to talk about when they were together . ( " Why do n't you want me to touch your sore ? Does it hurt ? Is that from a bullet , too , Grampa ? Grampa , let me see your teeth . Did you have to buy your teeth when you were little ? " ) The old man taught the boy about money ( " This is a penny . Here 's one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten pennies . All these pennies are worth one of these . One of these will buy as many sourballs as all these pennies. " ) and a little bit about flowers ( " Never twist them off , cut them off with a scissors or they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln was shot because he made John Wilkes Booth give up his slaves . " ) . Because of their companionship the boy was on his grandfather 's side during the worst fight he had ever witnessed in the household . His mother started the fight . " Mr. Lockwood , when are you going to be as good as your word and tear down the wall ? " said his mother . " As long as there 's a Bundy alive  --  " " The last Bundy died two years ago , and the wall is still up yet , " said Adelaide Lockwood . " Well , do n't hurry me , young lady . " " Two years is time aplenty . You promised you 'd tear it down . " " I do n't remember no promise . I said we 'd talk about it . " " Mr. Lockwood , that 's a falsehood . You 're prevaricating . " " Call me a liar and be done with it , why do n't you ? " " If the boy was n't present  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trained to obedience , left the room but stayed in the hall outside the den . " Now , Mr. Lockwood , either that wall comes down inside of the next six months or we move out of this house . " Adelaide was getting Dutchier by the second : " We moo otta this hahs , " was the way she pronounced the threat . " My son wo n't move . " " There is where you 're wrong , Mr. Lockwood . Abraham wants thep104wall down as much as I do . I wo n't have my children raised in such a penitentiary with a prison wall around it . Now mind , you listen . Six months , Mr. Lockwood . " " Who 's going to pay to have the wall torn down and them bricks carted away ? " " With my own money it wo n't cost you . " " There 's better things you could do with your money . " " I do n't take orders how I spend my own money , Mr. Lockwood . Such as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and let you sit behind your wall . " " Tear it down and be damned to you . " " Will you order the contractor ? " " I 'll order the contractor . And I 'll pay the money . " " Mr. Lockwood , I 'm not a mean person , but I do n't like my boys growing up in such a penitentiary . They make jokes about my boy George , and they 'll make jokes about the baby too . " " I never heard any jokes about my grandson . " " You never see anybody any more . But they say is my boy like youknowin the Insane . " " Not a mean person , you call yourself , but you say a thing like that . " " Well , it 's what they say and I wo n't have it said about mine . " Little of the conversation had much meaning for George , but a few days later workmen appeared on the property and began the long , noisy , fascinating task of taking the wall apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the wagonload . The boy could not persuade his grandfather to come out into the yard to watch the workmen ; the old man would not leave the house nor look out the window to see how strange the yard seemed without the wall , nor even to observe the men when they began putting up an iron fence that was not much higher than the boy himself . The old man now spent most of his time in his room , taking his meals alone there , and he no longer had time , he said , to tell the boy any stories . So matters stood for about a month , and then the grandfather changed his habits . Every day he would leave the house in the morning , go to the barber shop and from there to the Exchange Hotel bar and remainuntil late afternoon , when Rafferty would bring him home in the cut-under and assist him to his room . In a year he died , without ever telling his grandson another story , but by that time George was in the first grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . A lot of soldiers were at his grandfather 's funeral and his grandfather was in a box that was covered by an American flag and instead of a hearse the box was on a sort of cart drawn by four horses , two ridden byp105soldiers , and at the cemetery the soldiers shot their guns in the air and another soldier played a bugle . George 's father was in a soldier suit and so were a lot of other men who were not soldiers . After the funeral was over George saw a lot of the real soldiers from out of town and many of them were drunk . An old man named Mr. Baltz had supper with his mother and father and all he seemed to do was shake hands with everybody that came along . George Lockwood had never seen anyone shake hands so much . His other grandfather , in Richterville , was not a teller of stories , but it was pleasant to visit him even so . Near Richterville there were two pony farms , and Grossvater Hoffner , as he preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies and ride around in the shiny wagon that was drawn by a four-pony hitch , always promising George that when he got a little older he could have a pony of his own . At Grossvater Hoffner 's house George would sometimes be visitingat the same time his cousin Davey Stokes , a year older , was visiting . " Are you going to get a pony from Grossvater ? " George once asked his cousin . " He says I am , but I do n't believe him , " said Davey , who then reported to George that several other cousins , one of them eleven years old , had been promised ponies , but that Grossvater always kept putting off the actual purchase . Their cousin Leroy Hoffner , the eleven-year-old , was still being taken out to look at the ponies and ride around in the wagon , but had been given no pony of his own , and soon would be getting too big to have a pony . George hated David Stokes for telling him these things , and went on believing Grossvater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his next birthday he got a pony , a set of harness , a trap and a cutter . Within a few weeks David Stokes likewise had a pony , and so did Leroy . " Did Grossvater give me the pony ? " George asked his mother . " You might say he did . " " But did he ? " " You might say so . Why do you care , as long as you got it ? " " Because I want to tell Davey . " " Well  --  no . Poppa and I gave you the pony , but Grossvater gave me the money for my share , so you might say he gave you the pony too . " " But do I have to thank Grossvater too ? " " No , you do n't have to thank him . " " Then he did n't give it to me , or you 'd make me thank him . " " You 're like your Poppa . You can twist around with your questions . Just do n't say any more about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told George that their Gross/vater had not bought it , that it had been bought by his parents , and that Leroy Hoffner was getting one from his parents . " Grossvater is a big liar , " said Davey Stokes . " He 's a dumb-Dutch big liar , that 's what my father says . My father says all the Dutch are stingy . " " Your mother 's Dutch . " " Not any more . " " She talks Dutch . " " She does not , " said Davey Stokes . " My father wo n't let her . " " She does so . She talks it to my mother . My mother is your mother'ssister . " " Anybody knows that . " " Anyway , your mother talks Dutch to my mother , so you do n't know everything . " " Anyway , my grandfather did n't kill two men and your grandfather did . " " My grandfather was a soldier in the War . " " That 's all you know . Ha ha ha ha . Your grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's why . My father was a soldier , too . " " Ha ha ha . Your grandfather killed two men before he was a soldier . He was arrested . " " He was not . He killed an Indian . " " He did not . He killed a man that owed him money . Ha ha ha ha . " Davey Stokes was so sneering and positive that George Lockwood asked his father about Grampa . " Poppa , did Grampa kill a man ? Two men ? " " Where did you hear that ? " " Davey . He said Grampa was arrested . " " Oh , your uncle 's been talking . Well , it had to come out sooner or later , " said Abraham Lockwood . " Yes , Grampa killed two men . " " Not Indians ? " " No , not Indians . White men . Long before I was born , one man tried to rob your Grampa , sneaked into his room in a hotel , with a dagger , and Grampa shot him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before I was born , when it was n't safe to go out at night . In fact , your Grampa was what you might call a constable , a policeman . " " Then they could n't arrest him if he was a policeman , could they ? " " Yes , a policeman can be arrested . Anybody can be arrested . Even somebody named Stokes can be arrested . " " Was Uncle Sam arrested ? " " No . But that 's not saying he could n't be . Or that no Stokes ever was arrested . Anybody at all can be arrested . "  | " Was Grampa ? " " Yes . He shot another man . He thought the man was going to shoot him , and Grampa shot first . " " Is that why they arrested him ? " " Yes . You do n't know about courts , yet , do you ? " " About what ? " " In a court a judge decides whether a man is guilty . A judge and a jury . Twelve men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty , and they decided Grampa was not guilty . " " Did n't the man die when Grampa shot him ? " " Yes , he died . But Grampa was n't guilty . I 'll have to explain these things when you get older . You 're too young to understand it now . " " Davey understands it . " " No he does n't . " " But he told me Grampa shot two men , and you said he did too . " " He still does n't understand about the law , and court . His father neglected to explain that . It 's too bad his father had to say anything at all . " " Are you mad at Uncle Sam ? " " Oh , no . No , of course not , son . But Davey should n't listen to grownups ' conversations . Little boys never should . They hear things they should n't hear . " " Are you going to have a fight with Uncle Sam ? " " Of course not . " " Poppa , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He killed some Rebels , but not Indians . " " He told me he did . " " Oh . Well , I do n't know what stories Grampa told you , but he made up most of them . " The boy remembered that his grandfather 's stories varied from telling to telling , but basically the stories had been the . same . He wanted to ask his father how he knew that Grampa had made up the stories if he did not know what stories Grampa had told ; but the question was too complicated to present . The disclosure of the conversations in the Samuel Stokes householdwas a disconcerting one to Abraham Lockwood . Sam 's marriage to Sarah Hoffner , followed by Abraham 's marriage to Adelaide , had seemed to Abraham Lockwood to have the immediate effect of connectingRichterville , Swedish Haven , and Gibbsville in an alliance that was momentarily a merely social one . But since the alliance plainly did connect the first families of Gibbsville , en bloc , with the first family of Richterville and the first family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upstate girl would seem to have been extremely sapient in his long-range plan to be an important , if not dominant , figure in the life of the county . He had accomplisheda desirable union with the Gibbsville oligarchy without incurringtheir suspicions by courting a Gibbsville girl . He had , in fact , by marrying a Richterville girl , made a move that should have disarmed the cynical . He thought of himself as having made his way into the Gibbsville oligarchy modestly , through the back door . Now it appeared from the revelations of the conversations in the Stokes householdthat he had not made his way into it at all . For he attached greater significance to the remarks of Davey Stokes than those of an eavesdropping child . Sam Stokes was a full-fledged member of the oligarchy , and as he grew older a place would be made for him in the business and social life of Gibbsville ; but meanwhile he was very much a lesser member of the Stokes-Hofman-Chapin clan , not likely to express opinions that were contrary to the prevailing mood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in the town of Gibbsville or the county of Lantenengo , and Abraham Lockwoodhad long ago dismissed Sam Stokes as a possible threat to his own ascension to the place occupied by Peter W. Hofman . Once , and only once , Abraham Lockwood had done something to displease Peter Hofman : after the warning by Harry Penn Downs in the Gibbsville Club the Lockwoods , father and son , paid special attention to the affairs of the Swedish Haven bank , particularly in regard to the decreases in deposits that would give a quick clue to the identity of Swedish Haven business men who might be hoarding money to establish a second bank . Four merchants ' names stood out , and Moses Lockwood was in favor of drastic action ; but Abraham Lockwood , the second-generation advocate of good will , had a talk with each of the men . He said he had " received information " that the man was negotiating with Peter Hofman to open a new bank -- a complete invention , since he had received no information whatever . He then would pretend to be sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with out-of-town assistance , there must be some reason . If , on the other hand , the reason was no better than merely that the man wanted to help a Gibbsville banker to go into competition with the Swedish Haven bank , Abraham Lockwood and his father were grievously disappointed . Abraham Lockwood avoided the appearance of a threat to the man . What he wanted was some admission on the man 's part that he was in cahoots with Peter Hofman . In three of the four cases his guess was correct , and he had three names to mention when he paid a call on Peter Hofman.  | " Good morning , sir , " said Peter Hofman . " What can I do for you ? " " A great deal , sir , " said Abraham Lockwood . " But the question is , will you ? A few years ago my father and I opened a bank in Swedish Haven  --  " " Just a moment , sir . I believe the bank was started by some other men , and you and your father came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression , I know , sir . The facts prove otherwise . My father and grandfather , and later my father and I had conducted a business that was for many years the only banking service in Swedish Haven . " " Yes indeed , and a highly profitable business it was . " " Oh , yes . My grandfather and my father and I are not in business for our health . Neither were the men that borrowed from us , over those years . Neither are you , Mr. Hofman . " " Indeed not . " " Agreed . Now of course any profitable business creates its own imitators . You yourself have seen that in the leasing of coal lands . You and your father used to have that pretty much to yourselves , but others , especially Philadelphia and New York men , have known a good thing when they saw it , and you have a lot of competition . " " Competition is the life of trade , so they say . " " And the death of some tradesmen , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? In Swedish Haven there was a movementstarted to open a bank . Now , Mr. Hofman , who started that movement ? That movement was started by some men who had been borrowing money from us , prospered , and decided that now that they were enjoying some prosperity , why not take that business away from the Lockwoods and share it among themselves ? " " Logical . Understandable . " " But very little goes on in Swedish Haven that my father and I do n't hear about . And we knew inside of a week that a few men wanted to give a bank . That would have been presumptuous on our part . We were n't a bank . It was always either my father and grandfather , or my father and I , lending our own money and not the money of anyone else . This little group of men proposed to lend the money of their depositors , and that worried my father . " " Indeed ? " " Yes . It was n't only that some of these self-styled bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit with our firm.  |p110The  thing that worried my father was , what if this new bank should fail ? Who would suffer ? The depositors would suffer . " " Moses Lockwood was worried about the depositors of this new bank ? A touching concern , my dear sir . Very touching . " " I 'll ignore that , sir . Just hear me out , please . Common courtesy . I do n't argue that my father was worried for sentimental reasons . He was worried for business reasons . If that bank failed , we failed , because  it could very well be the end of Swedish Haven . If the people that worked for us put their money in this new , risky bank , and the bank failed , who would be able to pay us our rentals ? That 's just one source of our income , but a big one . You know what our holdings are . " " I can make a pretty good guess . " " Therefore , my father and I stepped in , got rid of those we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put it , took control . But without us there 'd have been no bank . " " Meanwhile , of course , holding on to your money-lending busi-ness . " " Naturally . We could afford to take risks with our money that a bank could not . " " Oh , that 's the way you put it ? How interesting . " " I challenge you to put it any other way . Because those are the facts , my dear sir . The facts . The hard-cash facts . " " As seen by you , my dear Mr. Lockwood . " " As seen by my father and me , who are in a much better position to know the facts than anyone else , whether they 're merchants in Swedish Haven or magnates in Gibbsville . I invite you to dispute anything 1 have told you . " " I could dispute it all , if I chose . " " Oh , you could dispute anything , just for the sake of argument . But would you care to deny that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them start a second bank in Swedish Haven ? " " My dear young sir , who are you to come to my office and challengeme to dispute this or deny that ? " " Who am I ? Well , I 'm the legitimate son of a man who made his own way in the world , served his country and was badly wounded in the service of his country . One of the very first . A man who has shown great courage , and without it would n't be alive today . And , in this discussion , most of all , a man with an unblemished business record . Unblemished , Mr. Hofman . Unblemished , I repeat that . Would you say the same for Paul Ulrich ? " " Paul Ulrich ? "  | " Oh , come now , Mr. Hofman . Paul Ulrich is one of the men you are in cahoots with . " " I do n't like that word at all , cahoots . " " What word do you like ? You would n't like any word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of one of your cronies . " " I do n't like that word , either , and I do n't like your manners . " " I 'm told my manners are very good . I had them polished at the University and brought to a high gloss in Washington society . Please do n't complain about my manners , Mr. Hofman . Paul Ulrich 's mannersare n't outstanding . Neither are Cyrus Reichelderfer 's . Did you find Cyrus Reichelderfer another Lord Chesterfield ? When he 's come to me for money I always have to open the window . Cyrus has something that the medical students used to call animated dandruff . But I 've done business with him , helped him out from time to time . I do n't object to his manners or the things that grow on him , Mr. Hofman . I do object to his underhanded dealings with you . " " How dare you , sir ? " " Well , I 'm doing you a favor . If he 'll go behind my back , he 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Hofman ? I know you thought you were working in great secrecy , but here I 've already given you the names of two of your conspirators . I have more . " " You are insulting , sir . I must ask you to  --  " " To leave your office . Very well . And do you know where I think I 'll pay a call when I leave ? When I get back to Swedish Haven I may pay a business call on Wilhelm Strotz . Wilhelm Strotz . I 'll explain to Willy that you would n't admit to having any dealings with him . Mr. Hofman , I 've never tried to take any business away from you , but I 'll take it away from you if you try to take it away from us . I know my people . Good day , sir . " The second bank was not again heard of in Swedish Haven , and Peter Hofman , while not cordial , usually nodded and spoke to AbrahamLockwood by name when they visited the Gibbsville Club . Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute , but he was a young man , not so liable to remember the unpleasantness of the discussion . Moreover , the disputehad ended in a triumph for him in his first encounter with the Gibbsville oligarchy , and while the triumph was extremely satisfactoryand encouraging , Abraham Lockwood was too ambitious to rest there . With his eye on the future he overlooked the damage his triumphhad inflicted on Peter Hofman 's hitherto unchallenged selfesteem . Abraham Lockwood , it was true , knew his people , but he really knew next to nothing of Peter Hofman . But he was learning . The low-ranking Samuel Stokes had inadvertently told Abraham Lockwood that the Lockwood link with the ruling clan of the county consisted of a single , tenuous connection by marriage , a marriage to an in-law of the same low-ranking Samuel Stokes . Abraham Lockwoodhad made the kind of mistake he seldom made in business : he had overrated the worth of something . But he rarely made the same mistake twice . The discovery that his marriage had accomplished so little did not alter his determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockwood at this time was on the outermost edges of the Peter Hofman oligarchy ; the time would come when it would be a Lockwood oligarchy , and the importance of any individual would depend on his closeness to the Lockwood line . Abraham Lockwood was not convinced that this reversal would occur in his own generation ; he himself might not live to become a Peter Hofman . The Hofmans happened at the moment to be in the ascendancy in Lantenengo County , and besides their Lantenengo relatives they had kinship with Muhlenbergs and Womelsdorfsin the counties to the south , pre-Revolutionary families of distinction . Abraham Lockwood , not positively certain of the identity of his own grandmother , fully appreciated the size of the task he had set himself ; but now that he had two sons , George and Penrose , he might at any rate live to see one of them  --  or both  --  the acknowledgedsymbol of power in the county . His ambition , of course , did not stop there . In some distant day men of his blood would have national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share in it ; but he was building toward it . Abraham Lockwood had learned that as the leading family of a region his children and their children would carry more prestige than as numbers of one more family in New York or Philadelphia . Peter Hofman was an unimaginative man , who apparently had no ambitionsbeyond Lantenengo County . Abraham Lockwood wanted to overtake and pass Peter Hofman in the county , and go on from there while still remaining a Lantenengo County citizen . Future Lockwoods would always have Lantenengo and Swedish Haven to come back ? o ; they must never abandon their Pennsylvania , Lantenengo County , Swedish Haven , identity , for to do so would be to lose their uniqueness . Abraham Lockwood was , in effect , granting himself a title and his children a dukedom . And an attractive feature of his long-range plan was that while money in large quantity was an essential , it did not have to match one of the great fortunes that were being amassed in Philadelphia and New York . He would bring up his sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inculcated sense of how to make it ; but the model he secretly chose for imitation by his sons wasp113Morris Homestead . Morris Homestead was not Abraham Lockwood'schoice of the man with whom he would do business , since Morris Homestead was not inclined to make more money , or to make it quickly , or to make it for anyone else . Nevertheless Morris Homesteadwas the kind of millionaire Abraham Lockwood wanted his sons to be . Abraham Lockwood had justifiable confidence in his own ability to make money , to establish a fortune ; then once having taught George and Penrose how to take care of their inheritance , they could remain in comfortable , affluent obscurity while deciding which boards to sit on , which ambassadorships to take , what games to play , whose women to sleep with . Now , with only twenty years of the Century remaining , Abraham Lockwood had nothing to fear from the Gibbsville oligarchy , despite the knowledge that his concept of a Gibbsville  --  Swedish Haven  --  Richterville axis ( which he would rapidly control ) was an error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken too much for granted as regarding the three-town axis ; but his inheritance from his father and the money he was making through his own efforts gave him protection from the Gibbsville money-men . Knowing what they thought of him , he could afford to be nice . His father , and his fatherin-law , Levi Hoffner , would have declared war on the covertly hostile Gibbsville men ; but Abraham Lockwood was an original strategist . And while he conceded that he had misjudged Peter Hofman , he was convinced that he had not misjudged the others in Gibbsville , whom he held in lower esteem , a judgment based on the knowledge that among the others there had not been in thirty years a single man who seriously challenged the placid despotism of Peter Hofman . The only threat to Peter Hofman 's dominance had come not from Gibbsville but from outsiders , from Philadelphia and New York . Abraham Lockwood therefore asked to call on Hofman , knowing that the old man 's curiosity would overcome his impulse to refuse to see him . Hofman did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man turned in his swivel chair and folded his hands across his belly . " Good afternoon , sir , " said Peter Hofman . " Good afternoon , Mr. Hofman . " " Well , what have you got up your sleeve this time ? " Abraham Lockwood made an elaborate business of looking up his sleeve . " A pair of slightly soiled cuffs , and a pair of cuff buttons that my dear mother gave me when I graduated from the University . However , if you ask me what I have in my billycock , I 'd have another answer . " " A rabbit , no doubt , " said the old man . " No sir , I 'm not a magician . " Abraham Lockwood took somep114papers from his hat and extended them toward Hofman , who did not hold out his hand . " Tell me what they are . My eyes are tired . " " These are the plans of a toll bridge . Rough drawings , but the figures are accurate . " " A toll bridge ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know where the river bends and the road follows the curve of the river , then goes up a steep hill below Klauser 's farm ? " " I know the spot . " " This bridge would shorten the distance between the two towns by almost a full mile , and eliminate the two steep grades that a team with a heavy wagonload has to rest on . This toll bridge could be built for about $35,000 . " " And be washed away in the first flood . " " Not this bridge . " " Well , go ahead and build it , " said the old man . " . It 's going to make money , Mr. Hofman . It 's going to make money now , and it will make more and more as the two towns grow . In due course the county or the Commonwealth will have to buy this bridge . " " Well , you have $35,000 . You inherited a great deal more than that from your father . It 's not all gone , is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled the money I inherited from my father . " " You have ? That 's a most unusual statement to make . " " I would n't make it if I were n't convinced that you 're well aware that it 's the truth . " " I believe I did hear that you 've been having some luck with some speculation of yours . " " Not only mine . Your friends in Drexel &; Company have been in on some of these speculations . " " Have they indeed ? " " Mr. Hofman , it 's now obvious that you do n't want to hear any more that I have to say . " " I 'm only curious as to why you came to me , Mr. Lockwood . You can build this bridge without my help or anyone else 's , and I must say I think it appears to be a promising investment . Why did you come to me ? " " As a courtesy . You 're the leading citizen of Gibbsville , and this toll bridge should make our two towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any great effect on your fortune , nor for that matter on mine . "  | " I take it then that you consider yourself the leading citizen of Swedish Haven . " " Well , I have more money than anyone else . Than any two citizens of Swedish Haven . Possibly any three . And I 've begun to follow the example set by you . " " Explain that , please . " " I give more money to the people of the town than anyone else . You do that in Gibbsville , I do it in Swedish Haven , now that I can afford to . " " I was brought up to believe in sharing . " " So was I , Mr. Hofman . Perhaps you do n't know it , but my father built the Lutheran church , and we put up the money for the South Ward public school . I say perhaps you do n't know it . I know you do n't know it , and very few people do . I am interested in the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedish Haven and the future of Gibbsville are bound together , one with the other . " " I should like to ask you a question . Why do you stay in Swedish Haven , when you could make your fortune in one of the large cities ? " " I suppose for the same reason that you stayed in Gibbsville . A man can love his home town , and if he does n't there must be some reason . I have every reason to be fond of Swedish Haven , and I 'll never leave it . " " You surprise me , Mr. Lockwood . " " I do n't see why I should surprise you , Mr. Hofman . You do n't know me very well . You scarcely know me at all . . . Well , I 've taken up enough of your time , and we both have other things to do . Good day , sir . " He stood up , tossed the papers back in his hat , and turned to go . " Mr. Lockwood , let me have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now at last they were in a joint venture . The news caused new hostility toward Abraham Lockwood , but of a different kind ; and the hostility among jealous relatives of the old man was offset by a gain in 1 . dal prestige . The old man let it be known that the idea for the toll bridge had originated with his younger partner-of-the-moment , and when Peter Hofman addressed the younger man as Abraham , the minor members of the clan went him one better and called him Abe . At the ceremonies of the bridge opening , where George Lockwood cut a red ribbon , Abe Lockwood smiled in his friendliest fashion at Samuel Stokes , who would not have dared to be absent.  |p116THE  father without a plan ruled because he was the father ; the father with a plan , an Abraham Lockwood , was more likely to extend the scope of his supervision to take in the small and large things as they advanced or hindered his plan . The father who confidedhis plan to his wife was acting voluntarily ; even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time and especially in that **25;6350;TOOLONG area the husband and father was impervious to criticism  --  or the wife 's criticism was made at her own risk . Divorce was almost nonexistent , and the wife who endured the intolerable could not count on the support or encouragementof her parents , let alone of her friends , if in her desperationshe went to law . Having taken that step she still had to put her case before a judge who in all probability was opposed to any and all divorce . A woman who wanted to be free of her husband at any cost could achieve her freedom at the price of her reputation : she could be so flagrantly adulterous that the husband would sue , and he would win . Under such conditions marriage was permanent and the rule of the husband and father was absolute , and these things were understood by all nubile girls . If Adelaide Hoffner questioned her sister 's chances of compatibility with Samuel Stokes on Sarah 's wedding day , the questioning was academic . Academic and forlorn , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intojoyfully , as the realization of an ambition ; but the finality of the new status was as much a source of apprehension as the hazards of the physical union . A lucky , attractive girl might have her choice of suitors , but they seldom numbered more than two or three , and the maiden 's true preference of one to the others was often discouraged . Love was not regarded seriously as a determining factor , since the girl 's mother in all probability had not been allowed to marry for love . The delightful novelty of the use of the expression , " a real love match , " was unintended evidence of the rarity of the phenomenon ; it did not often apply . Sometimes love  --  as always promised  --  came into being after the marriage was an accomplished fact , and the marriagethen could be considered a happy one ; but love itself could be threatened by the propinquity that had originally brought it into being . Thus Adelaide Lockwood , in love with her husband after the first months of their marriage , was confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest pleasure in many women 's lives was their right to mother their young , and they mildly resentedpaternal interference . The father could stay out of the nursery ; time enough to exercise his authority when the children were grown . Abraham Lockwood , however , had shown an interest and made decisions governing the upbringing of his sons from their birth . Their diet , their sleeping habits , the temperature of their bath water , the selection of nurses , the children 's exposure to sunlight , the degree and method of punishment and reward  --  nothing escaped Abraham Lockwood 's attention , and the only explanation he offered was that he was one of the " new " fathers , who took a more active part in the raising of the children . Adelaide , unable to protest on any reasonable grounds , did not accept her husband 's explanation . She deduced that her husband had ambitions for their sons , but this was as close as she ever came to comprehending his plan . The evolution of the plan had commenced earlier than Abraham Lockwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of his election to membership in The Ruffes he had not long deceived himself as to his actual standing in the off-campus life of his clubmates . He did not agree with Thomas Fuller ( 16o8-166i ) that mannersand money make a gentleman , nor with the contemporary John Cardinal Newman that a gentleman was one who never inflicted pain . Abraham Lockwood 's association with the University bucks had taught him that Fuller was overly cynical and Newman not cynical enough , and that both had failed to define a gentleman . At the University , then in Washington , then in the post-bellum years , Abraham Lockwood had been evolving his plan with more thoroughness than the time he spent thinking about it might indicate . He had been fortunate in the kind of %-'man he made his wife  --  sound breeding , financially well off , adequately educated  --  but he realized at some undeterminable stage that his plan was not merely to raise his sons to be gentlemen . They would be gentlemen according to Fuller , but for them to be gentlemen was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step toward the family status in the generation that would succeed his sons ' . Abraham Lockwood knew that his grandsonsand great-grandsons would have no titles , but if his plan was successful , " Mr. Lockwood of Swedish Haven " would be sufficient , and he was becoming convinced that what he sought to achieve could be accomplished in the third generation , the second after his own . Abraham Lockwood 's plan was more than a plan  --  which was only a method  --  and more than an ambition  --  which was only a desire . It was a Concern , in the Quaker sense of the term . Although he was not a Quaker , he had heard of the Concern , which was the name given top118obsessive act or thought , or both , of a religious nature . A Quaker who accosted strangers on the street , a Quaker who used his money for special missionary purposes  --  each was said to be influenced by a Concern . Abraham Lockwood 's Concern was the establishment of a dynasty of his own line , beginning with Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . He would proceed , and was already proceeding , with his Concern as the theme and motivation of his life and of the lives of his family . The gentlemanlinessof his sons was not an end in itself but only a desirable , minor characteristic . Its place , its value in Abraham Lockwood 's Concern was quite possibly inferior to the place and value of the two fatal shootings in which Moses Lockwood had been involved . Assuming that his father had killed two men in cold blood , Abraham Lockwood felt no shame or even lasting embarrassment . Murder had never disqualifieda family from a position in history ; it was the method by which kings became kings , barons became dukes , and in the year 2000 the only Bundy and the only Lichtmann worth remembering might easily be the early Nineteenth Century victims of Moses Lockwood'squickness on the trigger . Then , too , assuming that there would be a friendlier appraisal of Moses Lockwood , the historian could make much of the man 's bravery in the first Battle of Bull Run . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero and a man of action , for of such stuff is family pride fashioned ; for the present and the near future Abraham Lockwood would have himself regarded as a man of business and leading citizen ; for the more distant future he would have his sons regarded as gentlemen , men of affairs , patrons of the arts , third-generation leaders of their community and the first generation upon whom the national public would bestow the title , Lockwood of Swedish Haven . He sometimes hoped for more sons , so that he could direct them into the professions  --  the law , medicine , the clergy , the army  --  but a larger family naturally increased the chances of breeding a scoundrel , and he could not give to five or six boys the same supervision that he could concentrate on George and Penrose . Abraham Lockwood , as stated , had heard of the Quaker Concern , and he was aware that his great plans could be called a Concern , but he did not so refer to them , or it . He gave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A campaign . A plan . A strategy . An obsession . A purpose . A mania  --  it did not matter that he gave it no name . It could have mattered if he had given it a name , since a designation , a definition would have inhibited his actions within the meaning of the name . It was so constantly in his thoughts and took so many forms of action that an action that could be called loving was sometimes followed byp119an action that could be called cruel , and neither modifier would be applicable to a third action . Since the Concern was Abraham Lockwood'ssecret it did not need a name . Adelaide would have understooda father 's ambition to have George become a lawyer and Penrosea banker , but Abraham Lockwood could not make the daughter of Levi Hoffner understand the Concern , and he did not try . There was , after all , the danger that Adelaide might not agree with her husband 's plans for her sons ' future , and Abraham Lockwood had a respect for her potential influence . The boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most mothers , she was strict but kindly , she bound their wounds and calmed their fears , and her education had not taken her so far from their mental level that she was unable to comprehend their small , daily discoveries . She was extremely useful to their well-being and as a symbol of gentle discipline , which preparedthe boys for unquestioning obedience of their father 's orders . He could , moreover , count on her support even in situations where she was not sincerely on his side . George wanted a dog , but Abraham Lockwood had seen dogs go mad with hydrophobia , racing up and down the street until someone brought out the shotgun . Therefore George was denied a dog , althoughAdelaide had all but given her consent to the purchase of the red setter that he asked for . George did not want to go to school in Gibbsville , although the trip back and forth every day meant a ride on the railroad train . " Naturally , he does n't want to go to private school . The school he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April , " said Abraham Lockwood . " And if he stays in public sc ' pol here , pretty soon you and I wo n't be able to understand him , he 's so Dutchy . " To Adelaide it did not seem fair that once a week George had to remain late in Gibbsville for his piano lesson with Professor Fischer . " He does n't get home any day before the four-twenty-five . That does n't give him much time to play with his chums , " she said . " He has all the other afternoons and all day Saturday . You wish you could play the piano , and I wish I could , " said Abraham Lockwood . So matters stood until several months later . " Poppa , George wants to tell you something , " said Adelaide one evening before supper . The boy was flustered . " Go ahead and tell Poppa , " said Adelaide . " I 'll leave you two alone . " She went out . " What is it , son ? " " Poppa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He makes me sit on his lap and kisses me. "  | " Professor Fischer ? " " Yes sir . " " What else does he do ? " " He squeezes my behind . " " In front , too ? Your pecker ? " " Yes . He wants me to squeeze his pecker , too . I do n't like him . I do n't want to squeeze his pecker , but he makes me . Do I have to take piano lessons , Poppa ? " " You can stop taking them from Professor . " George 's study of the bass clef was resumed under Miss Bessie Auchmuty , organist at the Swedish Haven Lutheran Church . AbrahamLockwood concluded that it was not his duty to inform the Gibbsville parents of Fischer 's overtures . The joint venture between Abraham Lockwood and Peter Holman entailed no such responsibility . The Gibbsville parents could safeguard their own young , and Abraham Lockwood would do the same for his . It was altogether possible that the Gibbsville parents had deliberately refrained from warning him that Fischer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in undertaking to build a toll bridge that would mutually benefit the two towns , had not committed himself to a programof furthering the interests of a town where so many leading citizens still looked down their noses at him . If any Gibbsville parents should ask him why he had changed piano teachers , he would tell the truth ; otherwise he would remain silent . ( As it happened , the Gibbsvilleparents , without having had any information from Abraham Lockwood , subsequently banished Fischer , and for several years musicaleducation of the very young was at a standstill . ) The boys ' religious training was left to Adelaide ; Abraham Lockwoodwas not on sure ground in such matters . He could not convincinglygive the fundamentalist answers to their inevitable questions , and attendance at church on Sunday was as far as he cared to carry his recognition of the place of formal religion . For a time he considered the desirability of subsidizing an Episcopal mission in Swedish Haven . The Episcopal was the church of fashion , increasingly so in the East and especially so in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedish Haven to warrant the forming of a parish , but Trinity Church in Gibbsville served a mission in Collieryville , which was the same distance from Gibbsville as Swedish Haven . A Trinity Church curate conducted weekly services in the Collieryville Odd Fellows Hall , and Abraham Lockwood had no doubt that he could persuade the rector of Trinity to provide the same facility for Swedish Haven . But Abraham Lockwood , after viewing the project from the point of view of his Concern , decidedp121that the boys were better off as Lutherans , at least until they were ready to go away to boarding school . He and his father were forever on the records as donors of the Swedish Haven Lutheran Church , and it would be foolish to toss away such a respectable bit of family history . ( " My grandfather gave the Lutheran Church . " ) The boys already were third-generation Lutherans . Then too , the Lutheran faith was , in a manner of speaking , the indigenous denomination of Swedish Haven , comparable to the Society of Friends in Philadelphia , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view it was all the same God when you came right down to it , and when the boys sang about the Faith of Our Fathers they were stating a historic fact . The Lockwoods of Swedish Haven would naturally be Lutherans , and it was no more inconsistent for Lockwoods to be Lutherans than for the important German-name brewers and meat packers to belong to Trinity Church in Gibbsville . At this stage of their growth the boys chose their playmates among their contemporaries , without regard to the economic or social status of the playmates ' parents . During the school day George and , later , Penrose were in the company of boys whose families could afford private schooling ; at home in Swedish Haven , George had for chums the sons of a minister , a physician , a grocer , a railway brakeman , and the Negro porter at the Exchange Hotel . Penrose 's playmates were from the families of the physician and the grocer , and the others were sons of a jeweler-watchmaker , a widowed schoolteacher , and a secondcousin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys were forbidden to go : the railroad yards , the quarry pond , and the jungle north of town which was snake-infested and full of treacherous water-holes . The boys learned to swim and to skate at the canal , and to skin-the-cat in various barns , steal plums and cherriesfrom various orchards , hop ice wagons , experiment with stogies and chewing tobacco , attempt sexual intercourse with the grocer 's daughter , commit vandalism in the week preceding Hallowe'en , and try Roman riding with George 's and the physician 's sons ' ponies . George skinned his forehead and nose in a dive at the quarry , and Penrose fractured his left arm in a fall from a chestnut tree . Punishmentwas by spanking ; barehanded by Adelaide when they were young ; with an old trunk strap by their father when they were older . Ostensibly the boys throughout the grammar school years led lives that were no different from their contemporaries ' . Abraham Lockwoodwas not making a conscious special effort to teach the boys equality . On the contrary , his eventual purpose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible age , and so to arrange their vacation schedules that they would have very little time to spend withp122the sons of the brakeman , the porter , the schoolteacher , and the cousin of the Bundy brothers . But he did not want his sons to grow up as bookish freaks , as sissies , as **36;6377;TOOLONG . It was likewise his wish to let his sons have an early acquaintance with all classes in the town , so that when the time came for them to assume the position they would occupy according to the Concern , they would not do so as strangers or virtual newcomers . His own father , and even more so his own grandfather , had mental records and working acquaintance with every citizen in the town , and so had he himself . His sons would not be absentee landlords ; they would follow the proprietary tradition of the resident gentry , who knew their people , and George and Penrose were off to a good start . Abraham Lockwood 's Concern was not a bothersome thing , a chore , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concern to guide him it was easy to make small and great decisionsgoverning the raising of the two boys , despite the mystification of and occasional opposition from their mother . Nearly everything relating to the boys ' present could be related to the future of the Concern : the boys ' education , manners , attire , appearance , and the subtler items of pride , hauteur , independence , honesty , self-control , moderation and ambition . Oddly , as they grew older into adolescence , the boys developed a filial love that was to Abraham Lockwoodquite unexpected , and to their mother seemed somewhat perverse . They went to her for warmth , but they esteemed his approval . This thin , sharp man , who said no to so many of their requests , was nevertheless a positive factor in their daily lives , omnipresent even when they were secretly disobeying him , and always the adult they were most eager to please . Their love was his reward for his interest in them , which at their ages they accepted without looking for a reason behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completing the eighth grade in 1887 , departed for St. Bartholomew 's , an event of major significance in his father 's Concern , and one that had taken a great deal of serious consideration . The school was now old enough to have graduated some thirty classes , members of which had gone on almost without exception to Harvard , Yale , Princeton , the University of Pennsylvania , Dartmouth , Williams , and the University of Virginia , or to theological seminaries . It was a church school , the church being the Episcopal , situated in Eastern Massachusetts , and except for a handful of Southern boys , the students came from cities and towns in Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland and Delaware . Although not them/selves alumni , Harr . Penn Downs and Morris Homestead were sending their sons to St. Bartholomew 's . This fact , while influencing Abraham Lockwood , was of secondary importance in his consideration of suitable schools . Of major importance was the school 's New England location and its graduates ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra-curricular records . Abraham Lockwood had alreadydecided upon Princeton for his sons , but he wanted them to have friends at Harvard , Yale , and Penn as well , and since the majority of St. Bartholomew 's boys went to Harvard or Yale , the school provided the right opportunities for such friendships . Abraham Lockwood carefully avoided the appearance of imitating Downs and Homestead , and did not ask them for help in placing George at St. Bartholomew 's . Instead he went about it through Gabriel Bromley , assistant rector of Trinity Church , Gibbsville , and Joe Calthorp , a classmate and Zeta Psi at the University , both personal friends of the rectorheadmasterof St. Bartholomew 's . Abraham Lockwood wisely decided not to attempt to impress the school with his modest claim to social correctness , but to underplay his Philadelphia trumps . In the course of his correspondence and his single interview with Arthur Francis Ferris he told the headmaster that he hoped to have his sons accepted at St. Bartholomew 's because their background for a hundred years had been solid Pennsylvanian , on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wanted them to have the benefit of New Englandeducation . He lightly mentioned New England origins , but candidlystated that neither he nor his father nor his grandfather had any personal acquaintance with those Lockwoods . His strategy , he well knew , fitted in nicely with Arthur Francis Ferris 's cautious , slow-moving plan to admit a few boys who were not quite the usual type of St. Bartholomew student . Ferris had accepted one boy from Chicago and one from Buffalo , in his hesitant program against what he called inbreeding ; and while not committing the school to an acceptance of Penrose Lockwood , he took the older brother George . He had already satisfied himself that the financial present and future of the Lockwood family was safe , and any misgivingshe may have had in regard to Abraham Lockwood were put at rest by Joe Calthorp and Gabriel Bromley , who assured him that Lockwood was being over-modest in his social and business attainments . Joe Calthorp , who had not been a member of The Ruffes , mentioned that organization to Ferris , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bromley reported to Ferris that Lockwood and father had built the Lutheran church in their home town , and here again Lockwood had been silent.  |p124Abraham  Lockwood , to be sure , had had the advantage of knowingthat Arthur Francis Ferris had a Concern of his own  --  St. Bartholomew'sSchool . And so , in the autumn of ' 87 , those old friends Morris Homestead , Harry Penn Downs , and Abraham Lockwood were together again on a sleeping car to Boston . The Homestead and Downs boys , meeting the Lockwood boy for the first time , drew closer together in blank hostility to the stranger , to the embarrassment of the three fathers . It was the first setback for Abraham Lockwood 's Concern as well as the first time he had ever felt the rush of love and protective hatred that a parent experiences when his child is abused . For his son 's stupid cruelty Harry Penn Downs was to pay with his life . But in spite of the inauspicious beginning of his boarding-school career , George Lockwood was a delight to the Rector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algebra and Latin , and he was one of the best foot-racers in his class . His room was orderly , he kept his person clean , and his early homesickness lasted only until the masters gave public recognition to his excellence in his studies . Arthur FrancisFerris congratulated himself on his judgment ; in spite of his misgivingsabout the boy 's father , Arthur Francis Ferris had allowed the good of the program to prevail over prejudice , and his instinct was proving sound . Every boy at St. Bartholomew 's was given  --  for fifty cents , chargeableto his bill for books and incidentals  --  a small wooden box , 4 " deep by 12 " wide by i6 " long . The box had a hasp , and for an additional fifteen cents the boy was given a padlock and two keys . He retained one key , and the other key was held by the head prefect . But the privacy of the box was respected . No boy was supposed to open another boy 's box , and no master was supposed to open the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own special treasures in his box : letters , penknives , candy ( forbidden ) , extra collar and cuff buttons , shoelaces , family photographs , horse chestnuts , Indian arrowheads , medals for scholastic and athletic accomplishment , journal-diaries , watches and watch fobs , stamps , money ( forbidden ) , locks of girls ' hair , Sunday neckties . The boys had learned from handed-down information that the boxes were sometimes opened , in their absence , by masters in search of suspected pipes and tobacco and dirty pictures . Although candy and money were forbidden , punishment was not meted out for their possession ; the illusion was maintained that the boxes were notp125opened by masters , and small sums of money  --  under a dollar  --  and bits of taffy were not considered serious contraband . Every boy had his own special hiding place for his key ; some kept it around their necks on a string . And it was not considered bad form for a boy to go off by himself with his box rather than allow his roommates to see the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting offense and violation of the boys ' own code for one boy to force open another boy 's box . Most boys had special places for their boxes , and a boy returning to his room would know immediately that the location of the box had been changed . " Who moved my box ? " he would demand , and the question was the next thing to an outright accusation , was in itself often enough to touch off an argument that would lead to a fight . The supreme compliment was for one boy to show a friend the souvenirs and trinkets in his box , but two boys could be the best of friends all through school years without such a gesture . A boy carved or burned his name in the lid of his box , and even when he had nothing very interesting to disclose , the box was still his , private and secret and precious . Since there were no locks on any of the dormitorydoors , a boy 's box and the moments he had alone with it provided the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to get away from his schoolmates and the masters . A boy who opened another boy 's box risked not only a fight with the offended one but a beating by the offended one 's friends . Originally intended as a container for such articles as shoe blackingand brushes , hair combs , handkerchiefs and such necessary items and possessions , the box was a St. Bartholomew 's institution and tradition , and graduates of the school always took their boxes home with them , sometimes to use them all through college ; and already there were boys at St. Bartholomew 's who were using boxes originally owned by their fathers . Boys like Francis Homestead and Sterling Downs , sure enough of themselves on their own ground , got a quick lesson in humility by being reminded that they had new boxes , not their fathers ' . The contents  --  and sometimes the emptiness  --  of a boy 's box were always examined with self-consciously penetrating care by the masters , especially by the newer , younger masters , who were readers of Arthur Conan Doyle . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his box privately , in a far corner of the study-hall , when the boy , out of the needs of loneliness and unhappiness , would select one or two items to look at and fondle , rejecting all the rest . Nor could they know that some boys never reached that point where the box and its contents were preferable to human company . Some boys used their boxes just to keep things in.  |p126George  Bingham Lockwood 's box , which had G. B. Lockwood burned in the lid by a poker from the common-room fireplace , may have been unique . Instead of being a catch-all , with numerous unrelateditems in a scramble , it had four compartments , each containing its own more or less homogeneous articles . George had had slots cut in the inner lengthwise sides of the box to hold three little fences that made the four compartments . His silver watch-and-chain , collar and cuff buttons and safety pins were in one compartment ; his handkerchiefsand neckties in another ; his money and postage stamps in a third ; his letters from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except for the separating panels the box and its contents offered no strikingly unusual reward to the snooping masters . A few silver and copper pieces were the only contraband , and a curious master would close the box in short order . But the box had more to offer : it had a false bottom . The little fences that formed the compartments also deceived the eye . The fences , or panels , could be slid out of their slots , the contents of the box dumped on a desk , the box turned upside down , and by gently tapping the exterior bottom of the box , George would cause the interior " floor " of the box to fall out , and with it his secret treasure , two five-dollar gold pieces and a ten-dollar banknote . The possession of so much cash could have led to his expulsion , since no explanation he could give would be satisfactory to the masters or to Arthur Francis Ferris . George Lockwood  --  who went through four years at St. Bartholomew'swithout a nickname  --  had been given his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the school . For the first four months he used the box to protect the kind of personal possessions that roommates borrow  --  soap , hair combs , shoe blacking -- and since George had no need to have recourse to the box for solace , and since he always knew without reexamination what was in the box , the only fun he had with it was in keeping it locked and unlocking it in private . Then , a few weeks after being given the box , he learned that masters sometimes opened the boxes without warning their owners , and this violation of privacy so angered him that he studied his box more intently , until he worked out a plan to defeat them . At Christmastimehe took his box home with him and for fifty cents Mr. Dunkelberger , a Swedish Haven carpenter-and-joiner , fashioned the compartmentsand the false bottom . Mr. Dunkelberger was an artist in his line and had made many such hiding places in desks and bureaus and trunks , and he enjoyed the conspiratorial nature of George 's commission . ( " Vat you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) George put his Christmas presents from his Hoffner grandparents  --  the goldp127pieces  --  and the ten-dollar bill from his father in the false bottom of the box , and returned to St. Bartholomew 's with a gleefully defiant attitude toward the snooping masters . He would open his box once a week , and from time to time he could tell by the rearrangement of his possessions that a master had been going through the box , but Mr. Dunkelberger had done his work so skillfully that in all the four years George was at St. Bartholomew 's , the hidden money was never discovered . It could be said that George Lockwood made no close friendships at St. Bartholomew 's , or , with equal truth , that he had made many . He changed friends as often as he changed roommates . Only in the last year were the boys allowed to choose roommates , and George , permitted by the rules to choose two roommates , chose only one and left the selection of the other up to the head prefect . The one he chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the beginning George had not liked Sterling any more than Sterling liked him ; but in their second year at St. Bartholomew 's they had got along somewhat better ; and in their third year George felt sorry for Sterling Downs , as did all the boys in the school . In that year Sterling'sfather committed suicide . The joint speculative account maintained by Harry Penn Downs and Abraham Lockwood had gone from the original $10,000 to as much as $600,000 in less than ten years , largely , but not entirely , through purchases and sales of stocks that Downs had studied . At unstated intervals Abraham Lockwood would suggest that they liquidatetheir holdings , and he would take his profits , reinvest them in other securities or real estate , and wait until Downs came to him again with a new proposition . Abraham Lockwood never refused to go in with Downs , but he did not always go in for the amount Downs asked ; he demurred sometimes because he regarded the particular stock as too dangerously speculative , sometimes because his money was tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Downs was a successful speculator . The figures $10,000 and $600,000 were basic ; the larger figure did not nearly represent the sum that had been divided between the partners . In actuality they had each taken more than a million out of the stock market during their partnership , and $600,000 was the high point of the account as of the year 1889 . The two men had made money together from the start , but theyp128had been making larger amounts of money during the latter years , when relations between them were less cordial than ever before . Downs knew no reason for his partner 's attitude , since he could not have divined that his friend Locky had been offended by Sterling Downs 's rudeness to George Lockwood . He attributed the coolness  --  when he thought about it  --  to Lockwood 's preoccupation with his other business enterprises , and so long as Lockwood continued to put up 6o percent of the cash for their speculations , Downs was willing to dispense with the amenities . Not that Lockwood was overtly rude ; but their meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much at mealtimes . At one point , briefly , Downs contemplated a gesture toward improving social relations : his wife had never met Adelaide Lockwood , and his only meeting with her had been at Adelaide'swedding . But Martha Sterling Downs was not the most gracioushostess , and she would be at her least gracious while entertainingfor an upstate woman who had her trouble with her v 's and w 's and had probably never heard of the Philadelphia Assembly . Downs quickly dismissed the social idea , and went on meeting Lockwood at their offices in Philadelphia and Swedish Haven . At these meetings Lockwood usually had an accurate estimate of the condition of their joint account . " You 've made thirty thousand , I 've made twenty , " he would say . " Let 's take our profit now . " He seldom was insistent when Downs would urge their staying in a stock a little while longer , but there were exceptions to this amenability and Lockwood could be stubborn . When that occurred , Downs would yield , and there was no sharp difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in Downs 's office , and Lockwood wasted no time . " Harry , let 's sell our sugar stock , " he said . " Why ? It looks pretty good to me . We 're going to clean up in that , Locky . That 's one of the best things we 've ever had . " " Have n't I got any say in the matter ? " " Of course you have . But in this case you 're making a mistake . Do you know anything about Havemeyer ? " " I do n't know anything about Havemeyer . But I know about the Bank of America and those other banks failing , not to mention the life insurance company , also here in Philadelphia . I want to get out and stay out for a while . You can do what you please , but let me have my share now . It comes to a hundred and twenty thousand . " " I ca n't , " said Harry Penn Downs . " Why not ? " " I have n't got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got it ? "  | " We have no sugar stock at all . I lied to you . I did n't buy any . This was the one time you should n't have asked me . " " It sounds like the one time I should have asked you . " " No . I 've always been honest before , Locky , and I 've made money for both of us . " " What did you do with the money ? " " Well , it 's none of your damn business as long as I admit I 'm a crook . But I 'll tell you . I lost it playing poker . " " You lost $150,000 playing poker ? " " More than that . " " Where ? Who with ? " " At the Union League , never mind who with , although I suppose you could find that out if you tried hard enough . " " Yes , I suppose I could . Even at the Union League they do n't have many games as big as that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were a Philadelphia Club member .

" " But a year ago you were worth well over a million . " " Indeed I was , and winning at poker . But I 've had a run of bad cards , and I did the usual thing . I stayed in with hands that I should have dropped . " " Why did n't you get them to play whist ? " " These men are poker players , not whist players . " " Do you mean to tell me that you 've lost over a million dollars playing poker ? " " I mean to tell you exactly that . " " How could you do that ? Well , you could , of course . " " I lost over $400,000 in one night . Then I went to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lost almost the same amount . " " Oh , those men ! Why , you never had any right to be playing against them . They can keep playing till their luck changes . " " I had as much right to be playing poker against them as I had to be outguessing them in the stock market . And do n't forget , for a while I was a winner . " " How long have you been playing for such high stakes ? " " About three years . " " You should have let me know . " " I did n't think so . As long as I was making money for you . " " Is this pretty well known in Philadelphia , that you 've been losing all this money ? " " I guess so . "  | " Does your wife know ? " " She does now . The point is , Locky , what are you going to do ? You can have me arrested , of course . " " I could , but that would n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " You 're cleaned out , you say .

" " You were also speculating in some things you did n't let me in on ? " " Yes . " " Were you doing that as a favor to me ? Keeping me out because you did n't want me to lose money ?

In fact it seems very foolish . But I 'm talking in riddles . Good day , Harry . " " So long , Locky . Will you shake hands ? " Downs got to his feet . " Harry , I ca n't . I wish you luck , but I ca n't shake your hand . " " Good . I understand . It 's a very dirty hand . Filthy dirty . " " Good day , Harry . " On his way to the early evening train Abraham Lockwood distinguishedthe name " H. P. Downs " in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt the shock of confirmation without surprise upon reading that Harry had placed a pistol to his ear while seated at his office desk . The newspaper could not entirely leave out references to his stock market operations , but obviously an effort was being made to show no connection with the recent bankp132and insurance company collapses . On the homeward train Abraham Lockwood was glad to be headed for Swedish Haven , away , away from Philadelphia . He thought he knew precisely the degree of his guilt in Harry Penn Downs 's suicide ; he had given his partner and friend the final push . But before the homeward journey was over Abraham Lockwood was once again involved in his Concern . One human life could not be charged up against the Concern , but the unknowing victim had known what he was doing , and he had jeopardizedthe Concern itself  --  stealing from it  --  and threatened harm of a sort to one of the beneficiaries , George Lockwood . The irony of George 's subsequent invitation to Sterling Downs was not lost on Abraham Lockwood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nearly laughable . But the irony interested Abraham Lockwood less than the fact that a Lockwood was now in the graciousposition vis-a-vis a Sterling Penn Downs , and the other fact that a man had committed suicide as an indirect result of his interfering with the Concern . Somehow the Harry Penn Downs suicide and George Lockwood 's invitation to Sterling Downs became , in AbrahamLockwood 's mind , proof that the Concern had achieved the dignity of an establishment , the substance of an etablissement . It was getting to be like one of those private banking firms that can maneuvera nation into war ; or perhaps like a railway , a coal mine , a powder mill , in which human life must be counted among the productioncosts . Or  --  coming back to what the Concern really was  --  a man 's suicide and a boy 's gracious act belonged rightly in the general scheme of the building of a dynasty . During those weeks that followed Harry 's suicide Abraham Lockwoodoften wished he knew someone in whom he could confide the secret of the Concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a wild , short-lived impulse to confide in old Peter Hofman , who as a man of power would understand some aspectsof the Concern but as an unimaginative , conventional individual could not be expected to see very far into a future that for him had no reality . Morris Homestead , a member of a dynasty , would understand some aspects of the Concern but the dynasty of which Morris was a member was already in being , and nothing so new as the Lockwood Concern would hold as much interest for the present head of a dynastyalready in its third century . Morris Homestead 's placid acceptance of his inherited and continuing place in Pennsylvania history was an attitude that Abraham Lockwood viewed with admiring envy , and Morris served better as an unconscious model than as a contemporaryconfidant . And so , for the time being , the secret of Abraham Lockwood 's Concern remained intact , having survived some vaguep133suspicions on the part of Harry Penn Downs . It was , of course , much too early to explain the Concern to George Bingham Lockwood . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimen was being ordered with his grandsons ' and not his own life the beneficiary . George , his father knew , was an obedient boy , but not a subservient one and not an unimaginative one . The younger son , Penrose , was already in the habit of obedience to his father , his mother , and his older brother , and Abraham Lockwood was already sure that Penrose would go through his entire life always obeying someone , therefore would not be a hazard to the Concern so long as the right kind of person gave him the right kind of guidance . Abraham Lockwood looked forward to the time when George , married and with children of his own , could be apprised of the existence of the Concern in such a way as to make him a willing convert to it . That time , however , was not now . ( It was often remarked upon in Swedish Haven that Abraham Lockwood was a wonderful father to his sons . ) In his preoccupation with the Concern and his growing fortune , his motivated interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abraham Lockwood had little time or curiosity for what was happening to himself . The Concern , his own secret , was , to be sure , a personal matter comparable to a religious zeal , but in function the Concern dealt with the actions and postures and behavior of others than himself . Consequently Abraham Lockwood had not done much thinking about Abraham Lockwood , and he was taken by surprise when he discovered that the secrecy of the Concern and his reluctance to confide in Adelaide had altered his relationship with his wife . It was as though the Concern had become a mistress , whose existence was to be denied . So big an unshared secret , so integral a part of his thoughts and actions , daily and hourly , had grown insidiously from a precautionary measure to a conditioned attitude . At least every day of his life , and in many of his waking hours , Abraham Lockwood had to exclude Adelaide , until on no certain day , at no certain hour , but from one sleeping to one waking he was conscious of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw a mole on her shoulder that he had not noticed before ; one breast was slightly lower than the other ; her Pennsylvania Dutch accent was nearly gone ; changes had been taking place , and his failure to have noticed them taking place was bewildering until he traced the reason : the Concern . Abraham Lockwood was now forty-nine years old ; in good health , rich , and consciously enjoying the respectful treatment he was earningby maintaining his position in the community . He had not takenp134stock of himself at any of the milestones  --  at , for instance , age forty or age forty-five  --  and he was far from ready to slow down now , with so much yet to be done . The man who slowed down , stopped . A Morris Homestead had never moved at a rapid pace , since there was no particular reason for him to do so ; a Harry Penn Downs had moved at a rapid pace but he had slowed down , or been slowed down , because he had not had real staying power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resorted to dishonest practice because he was exhausted . He had consumed his legitimate energy , had then taken to desperate gambling and finally to plain theft . In any event , he had had to slow down , and slowing down , had stopped . According to custom , there was no one but immediate family at the funeral of Harry Penn Downs , a suicide . But when a week had passed Abraham Lockwood wrote a note to Martha Sterling Downs and , at his request , she allowed him to pay her a call . As he had said during his last meeting with Downs , Martha Downs would not have recognized him , but she was expecting him and was thus forewarned . She rose to greet him as he followed a maid into the library , and if he had vaguely expected a tearful , abject widow , he quickly conceded how wrong that was . " Good afternoon , Locky , " she said . " It 's very nice of you to call . You did n't bring your wife , Isee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , and this  --  " " Would n't have been the right moment . You 're right . Sit down , Locky . I call you Locky as if we were old friends . Do you mindthat ? " " I like it . " " There 'll be a cup of tea in a little while , but let 's wait , shall we ? " " Yes . " " I know you 're not a drinker , although if you 'd like something ? " " No thanks . " " I 'm very pleased that our sons are going to room together next year . It 's nice to continue the association . Smoke , if you like . I do , so it does n't bother me . " " I have n't got anything to smoke . I never carry cigarettes . " " Well , have one . " She offered him her tiny silver case , and he lit their cigarettes . " I 'm also pleased that we may be neighbors this summer . You have a cottage , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place called The Run , have n't you ? " " Why , yes . For several years . Are you going to be there ? That would be very good news . "  | ' " You must know the Westervelts ? Well , Mr. Westervelt is a cousin of mine , and he very kindly offered to let us have his boathouse . We could n't afford to go away otherwise . They 're going abroad this summer , so it works out very nicely . " " They have one of the nicest boathouses at The Run . One of the few that you can live in . You know what The Run is ? It 's a reservoir , an artificial lake , owned by the coal company , and people like J. B. Westervelt get the very best boathouses . You 'll enjoy it , if you do n't mind bathing in cold water . " " I prefer it to ocean bathing . Is your wife a swimmer ? " " No . This will probably be our last summer at The Run . Adelaide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped talking and she continued to look at him until he became uneasy . " Is there something wrong , Martha ? " She laughed . " Oh , no . No . " She laughed again . " What 's funny ? " " I could n't possibly tell you . Not possibly in a million years . It 's funny , and you 'd enjoy the humor of it , but quickly , let 's find somethingelse to talk about . I had n't realized I was staring . " " It must be something good . " " Do n't ask any more about it , please . Perhaps we 'd better talk about Harry . Did you lose a lot of money , Locky ? " " Do you want to know how much ? Actually although I lost some cash , my biggest loss might be called hypothetical . The profits on the cash Harry was supposed to invest for our account . " " Naturally I 've never seen the woman , never laid eyes on her . " " What woman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know all about it . In fact I 've known about it for almost two years , so do n't spare my feelings . Unfortunately , though , I 'm told that there 's no way to get any of the money back . Legally , it 's hers . Or at least it would be so hard to prove what is n't hers . The lawyers say that the New York courts would never make her give anything back , and of course if the Pennsylvaniacourts decided in our favor , what good would that do ? She 'll never show her face in this State , and she has no money here . Have you met her ? " No . " " One of the lawyers said she 's totally unlike me , which he intended for a compliment . But then in the next breath told me how feminine she is . And of course beautiful . I wonder how many others there were . Harry spent a great deal of time talking about that sort of thing , but I thought it was to shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wives like to be shocked . Well , I guess I did encour- ' age him . Some of our conversations would n't bear repeating . Poor Harry . How I must have bored him when I thought I was being deliciously naughty , and all the time he had a beautiful mistress in New York . Beautiful , and feminine , and young . Twenty-five or - six . I guess there must have been others . Yes . Harry and I married too young , the month he graduated . I 'm selling this house . You would n't like to buy it , would you ? " " It 's a beautiful house , but a bit too far away from Swedish Haven . " " Buy it , and I 'll be your mistress . Would n't you like to have a mistress to cone to when you 're in Philadelphia ? Of course I 'm not beautiful , or young . But I 'm feminine . That lawyer infuriated me when he said that . " " Of course I 'll buy the house , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes up for Mr. Jonas Ripley 's insulting remark . " " That 's what you get for having Jonas Ripley as your lawyer . I knew him in my college days , and I 've hardly ever seen him since , but I guess he has n't changed much . The kind of lawyer that people go to because his name is Ripley . " " That 's usually good enough reason , in Philadelphia . " " I have n't said anything to offend you ? " " No , no . I say much worse things about them than you 'd ever think of saying . I never traveled much with the pack , did n't you know ? No , I guess you did n't . All the years that you and Harry were in partnership together , I 've never met your wife , and is n't this the first time you 've ever been here ? " " I came here when I was at the University , but after the war I went back to Swedish Haven and stayed . " " You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you 'd married a Philadelphia girl you 'd have found that those college friendships have n't very much meaning . As soon as those boys graduate from college they come back here and start being Philadelphians again . The worst of them of course are those that never left , the ones that stayed here and went to the University instead of going to Harvard or Yale . All those boys that were in that whist club of yours . That one with the question mark for a stick-pin . " " The Ruffes . The club still exists . " " Oh , I 'm sure it does , but I 'm sure it has other reasons for existing besides whist . " She smiled . " It used to . " " That 's the very same smile you had on your face when you would n't tell me why you were smiling . "  | " Then we 'll have to quickly change the subject again . " " The smile had something to do with The Ruffes . You were not supposed to know anything about The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're better at keeping secrets than Harry was . Some secrets , at least . I know all about The Ruffes , or I used to . " " Well , since you 're in on our secrets , why not let me in on yoursecret ? Why did you smile ? " ) She shook her head . " No , Locky . Not in a thousand years . " " Well , we 're progressing . First you said a million years . Maybe I can get it down to a hundred before I leave . " " A million or a thousand , both mean never . When do you go to The Run place ? " " A week or two after school closes . Will you be there then ? " " Yes , just about the same time . I own this house , you know . It is n't part of Harry 's jumbled estate . And I 'm going to put it on the market in a week or two so that people can come and see it while I 'm away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell to me ? " Her manner suddenly changed . " What if I took you seriously ? " " I took you seriously . " " No you did n't . But I have a reputation for speaking my mind , not always to my advantage , and if I offered myself as mistress to some of the men I know , it would be taken very seriously . And I 'd mean it seriously . I 'm not very young and I 'm not very pretty , but there does n't seem to be much else for me to do . " " You 're certainly not serious now , although you sound it . " " Why not ? I 'd be better off as the mistress of some men I know . Men that have flirted with me and wanted to make love to me , and still would . I 'll have nothing but this house , you know , or whatever I get for it in cash . That will be enough to finish the children 's education , but where will that leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . " " It 's the best thing that could happen to me . " " And the worst . " " Because people talk ? They 've talked already . They 've always talked about me in Philadelphia , and when Harry shot himself the gossips got busy immediately . The women that did n't know he had a mistress thought that I must have had a lover . Well , I did . My first . A year ago . He ran like a deer , d , double-e , r , when the rumors started about Harry losing so much money . Oh , he ran ! He 's still running . Took a trip around the world , with his wife , of course . You do n't hear Philadelphia gossip , but I do , even when it 's me they 're gossipingabout . Although they never knew about my startled faun. "  | " I 've always wondered where people like you would meet . " " What bed we 'd use ? " She pointed upward . " Mine . My own bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of love . " " But the children , and the servants . " " After they 'd gone to bed . From ten o'clock on . I do n't know how or where other women had their rendezvous , but that 's the way mine were . " " And what about his wife ? " " Well , I do n't know how much I can tell you without identifying them . But he had a very good excuse to spend the night in town quite frequently . On business , you might say . " " He was a doctor . " " I wo n't say . " " Why did n't she become suspicious ? " " She was too clever to show much suspicion . When a woman has those suspicions , and is married to a very rich man , she 'd better not give vent to her suspicions unless she 's prepared to risk an open break . In this case , the woman was n't willing to risk anything . The husband could have told her the truth and she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had no pride . All she wanted was a life of ease and luxury . A box of chocolates and a trashy novel . A tiara that Queen Victoria would n't wear . Footmen in knee breeches  --  oh , dear , I should n't have said that . " " I do n't know anybody that has a footman in knee breeches . " " Yes you do . You 've never happened to go to their houses . " " Excuse me . " " You know three or four men who have footmen in knee breeches . " " I guess I do n't know them very well . " " No , but you probably thought you did . That 's why you were wise not to live in Philadelphia after the War . I 'm changing the subject deliberately . " " I 'm looking forward to this summer . " " Are you changing the subject too ? " " No , I 'm not . " " Oh . You 're changing it back ? " " Yes . " " To me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think we 've exhausted that topic . It 's curious how we ever got on it . I do n't think I trust you , Locky , but I like you . Or maybe it 's the other way round . It is . I trust you , even though I ca n't really say I like you . "  | " That 's too bad , because I like you . " " Yes , I know you do . You 're not in love with your wife , are you ? " " I do n't think I am , any more . We 've been married a long time . " " Happily ? " " Yes . Yes , I would say happily . " " This is the time when you 'd better be very careful . A clever young thing could twist you around her little finger . " " I doubt it . I do n't like clever young things . In fact , I guess I do n't like cleverness in a woman at all . When I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever young things . Some of the cleverest in the world , I guess . The women in the diplomatic corps in Washington . They were too clever for me . So I went home and married a PennsylvaniaDutch girl . Pretty . Intelligent . But not clever . A clever girl never would have fitted in with my  --  " He stopped abruptly on the verge of giving the first utterance to the Concern . " With your what ? " " Oh , my life , the kind of life I preferred . " " That is n't what you were going to say . " " Is n't it ? No , I guess it is n't . " " What were you going to say ? " He shook his head and smiled . " Not in a thousand years , Martha . " " Touche . " " Show me the rest of your house . " " You can come and see it when I 'm not here . " " No , that would n't be the same . " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you that rich , Locky ? " " I think I am , but I 'm not going to woo you with greenbacks . I could n't buy what I want from you . " She looked at him quickly , slightly troubled . " I wonder how you meant that . It could be the greatest compliment I ever had in my life . " " What other way could I mean it ? " " I 'm grateful to you for it , but I wish I had n't heard it . I have other plans . " " Forget the other plans . " " No . I have to think . " " Well , I 'll be at The Run after the first of July . " She became his mistress during the first week of July . He took her for a spin in the naphtha launch , tied up the launch on the south shore of the dam where there were no boathouses but in full view ofp140the boathouses on the north shore . They went into the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms . She had not spoken during the ride across the dam , and she went with him into the woods as if in obedience to a command . She kissed him eagerly , pressing her hands at places on his shoulders and down his back , always bringing him close to her and turning her head from side to side while holding his lips with her kiss . She took off her skirt and made a rug of it on the ground and sat on it while he helped her with the rest of her underclothes . Then he stripped and there was no time for tenderness or discoveries or sensuality but only the demand of each to possess the other before the world came to an end . Nothing that one said was heard by the other , and not by intent but by the speed of urgency they reached quick , very nearly simultaneous climax . Her dampened hair streaked down over her forehead and she kissed him many times while he was tired . Now they could hear voices , wafted from the opposite shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passing rowboat very near their shore . The music puffing out of the carrousel in the casino at the eastern end of the dam . The bell on the large launch that was about to make its hourly tour of the dam . The air whistle on the electric railway car from Gibbsville echoing down the valley . " I did n't hear anything before , " she said . " You 'd better put your things on . You never can tell when there may be picnickers . " " Why did n't you think of that before ? " she asked , not crossly . " Why did n't you hear anything before ? " " I 'd like to go in for a swim , just the way I am . And you with me . I 'd love to swim all the way down to the breast and back . And then maybe we could lie here together . " " All right , let 's . " " Do n't tease me . I just might . Oh , that was lovely , Abraham Lockwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the dam . " " A quarter of a mile . " " No ! No ! Turn your back to the other side and you 'd walk all the way around the world before you got to it . " " All the way around the world , less a quarter of a mile . " " Exactly . I 'm glad our first time was in the woods like this . The Garden of Eden . " " Speaking of the Garden of Eden , there are serpents over on this side . I do n't mean picnickers , either . " " Why did n't you think of that before ? " " I can only think of one thing at a time . "  | " I wish there was more to see here . How many times are you going to be able to take me sightseeing ? " " Not many , I guess . " " Shall we pick some berries to take back to your wife ? " " No . I 'll tell her we looked for some but saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are huckleberries . Do n't ever walk through these woods without a stick . " " I 'm not afraid of snakes , I rather like them . " " Yes , but they do n't know that , and do n't try to convince them . " " Do you care what happens to me ? " " Yes . " " Do you know what has happened to me ? " " What ? " " Everything . I love you . " " I love you . " " Yes , in your way you do . " " Why is my way different from yours ? " " It 's man 's love . Mine is woman 's love , and no other man will ever have me again , as long as I live . I swear it . You will have to go with your wife , but I 'll never have to go with another man . You wo n't mind going with your wife , but I could never bear to have another man . I 'm surprised , too . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I began when we got in the launch . I did n't want you to talk , and you did n't . Anything you said might have been wrong , but you did n't say anything . As though you knew how much I wanted you . Oh , I 'm chattering so nervously because I 'm still shaking inside . Next week I must go to Philadelphia , and you and I can spend the night in my room . Would that be nice ? " " Yes , " he said . " What were you smiling at that day , you would n't tell me . " " Oh . It 's embarrassing to tell you , but I ca n't refuse you anything now , so I guess I 'll have to tell you . When Harry and I were first married he told me a lot of things . And he told me about you . That you were known as the Stud Horse . I 'm sorry , but I 've never been able to look at you without thinking of that . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the launch I never thought of it . If I had , I might have been afraid . And I was n't afraid , was I ? " " No . But I 'm nearly thirty years older than I was then . Some women have bigger teats than others , too . Some people have bigger noses , or ears . Adelaide never heard about me and never saw another man  --  well , she did , come to think of it  --  but she never seemed to think I was out of the ordinary . Did you ever stop to think of how many tiny little women are married to big men ? And how many bigp142women marry little melt ? I think the whole thing is exaggerated . It 's a man and a woman getting together that counts . " " Well , now you know why I smiled , " she said . " Why are you smiling ? " " I was thinking how quickly a million years can pass , " he said . Adelaide Lockwood had never seen her husband walk across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The Run , he had twice gone off alone with Martha Downs , on the pretext of showing her about the resort ; but with Adelaide Lockwood life was extremely simple , and a man who went off alone with a woman , a woman who went olf alone with a man , and the two gone together for hours at a time th ; rt man and that woman wanted to be together to the exclusionof all others , and if they desired no other company , they desired each other . Desiring each other , given the opportunities , they would have each other . Thus her reasoning . " What is there between you and Mrs. Downs ? " she said , in their third week at The Run . " You know what there is between me and Mrs. Downs . Nothing . She 's Harry 's widow , and I 've been showing her around . " " I do n't believe you . " " Suit yourself . " " It stops , right now . " " You ca n't stop something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stop something before it begins . " " She only has another week here . " " " Then you do n't have to show her around any more . She should n't have come here . This is no place for her kind . " " You 're talking nonsense . George and her son are going to be roommates next year , and her husband was an old friend of mine , and partner . " " Such a friend you did n't need , that stole money from you and never invited you to his home . I do n't want you to see this woman any more . " " Who 's giving orders around here ? " " I never did , but I will now . I do n't want my home broken up . You 've been with this woman , it 's no use lying to me . I can tell by looking at the both of you . And there 's other ways to tell . I 'm twenty years married to you , do n't forget . Twenty years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy to fool . " " If that 's all you have to go on , you 're making a lot out of nothing . The first year we were married we did it every night . " " Ah , stop your lying . I can always tell that , too , when you 're lyingp143to me . I do n't know many men , but I know two . You , and my father . These two I know . " Adelaide had not believed his lies and had left no doubt of her disbelief , so that in consequence her accusation stood undenied , the charge became the truth , accepted and in a sense acknowledged by them as the truth ; the acceptance and the acknowledgement became a condition , and the condition was the cessation of their relations as man and wife . Although they had slept in the same bed throughout their married life , now after a few nights of the new coldness she put a cot on the porch and lay there . " Why did you do that ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , wet from her . " " You want to let everybody know . The servants , the children . " " Before was when you should have thought of that , " said Adelaide . " Very well , then we 'll never sleep in the same bed again . " " I the same as told you that , did n't I ? " " I guess you did . " " What if I have a man ? " " I 'll divorce you . Have you got one ? " " No , but I wanted to hear what you 'd say . " " Then you heard . Do n't have a man , or I 'll sue you for divorce . " " You wo n't always be here , Abraham . Think that over , " she smiled in a way that was extremely unpleasant for the absence of unpleasantness in the smile . " Who would you have ? " " It could be anybody , Abraham . Just as long as he had a cock to give me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she repeated , and he slapped her again . " Hit me as much as you want to , but now I got you worried . " She held her hands over her face to protect herself , but he did not again strike her . " I 'm not worried , but you 'd better be , " he said . " All the same , I 'm not . You 're going to see how it feels for a change . Every time I talk to any man . Every time you go away . Who is she with ? ' you 'll say to yourself . I know who you 're with , but you 'll never know . Friends of yours , or the grocery boy . I could be doing the same things to the grocery boy while you 're with Mrs. Downs . If I go visit my father in Richterville , who am I with ? You wo n't know . Maybe I 'll be out in the back alley , Abraham . Do you remember me telling you about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know where she died . In the crazy-house. "  | " Put me there , I dare you . You do n't want any more disgrace . Disgrace you 'd be afraid of . You started it , Abraham , but I know you . I know what you want . I know your weakness . The boys . The sons , Disgrace me , divorce me in the courthouse , but I 'm not dumb , Abraham . You want everything for the sons , and that 's why you 'll never do anything else to me . Do n't ever hit me again , either . You did that for the last time . " He went upstairs to their bedroom , where he kept his pistol in a locked drawer , but in the time it took to find the key his impulse to murder her subsided . To find the key , he had to think ; and before he could think he had to regain some self-control . He sat on the edge of their bed , out of breath from fury and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand was shaking , making odd shadows on the floor under the weak light from the bracketed kerosene lamp . One of the sons  --  Penrose  --  was snoring in the boys ' room , and down under the boat landing the bullfrogs were grunting . A woman laughed in a nearby boathouse and her laugh was answered by a dog at the far end of the dam . For the moment he forgot why he was in the bedroom , then remembered again when he became aware that he was gazing at a tintype of his father , made three-quarter face so that the mutilated ear would not show . Moses Lockwood , who had killed two men . Who had killed more than two men , but was remembered only for those two . Now Abraham Lockwood knew where he had hidden the key , hidden it so that his sons would not play with the pistol . He got the key from its hiding place behind his father 's tintype , unlocked the drawer , unloaded the pistol , put the cartridges in a different drawer , locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little delay had saved him once from committing murder ; a longer delay might save him again . He blew out the lamp and lay in his bed . She had escaped death , she would never again be in danger of it from him , but she would never again delight him or be delighted by him , by touch , by word of mouth , by a smile of welcome understanding , by gladness seen or heard . Let her live that way ; that could kill her , for her to deny love or for love to be denied her . She was not one to be sustained by hate . Let her waste , wither , die , and let her stay out of the way of The Concern . They had put their sons on the train to Boston , and now , for a change , they could walk together publicly , for a few minutes , without causing suspicion . " I did n't realize you had such a handsome son , " she said.  | " You 'd seen him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed up . At that age they do n't look like anything till they 've put on their best . Then you can begin to tell how they 'll look when they 're grown . He 's going to be a ladies ' man . Imagine wearing a buttonhole at his age . " " Why not ? " " No reason why not , but Sterling never would have thought to . George looks fully twenty years old . Sterling looks sixteen . " " I do n't want him to grow up too fast . " " You ca n't stop it , " she said . " We have all day to ourselves , but we ca n't go just anywhere . Would you like to meet a cousin of mine ? " " It 's pretty hard not to , in Philadelphia . " " This one is very unusual . An odd bird called Alice Sterling . She has a salon . She 's getting along in years , but she 's still one of the most interesting women I know . She likes me because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard of her . She 's the queen bee of a bunch of artists and bohemians , is n't she ? I do n't want to meet her . " " Very well , you wo n't have to , but take me to her house , please . That 's my headquarters for the day . You 're coming out tonight , are n't you ? " " Of course . " " Well , take me to Alice 's now . 1 have some things to talk about that I do n't want to put off . " They took a hansom to Alice Sterling 's house near Rittenhouse Square . The sitting-room in this house that seemed so dark from the outside was made bright by the floor-to-ceiling windows , washed to a sparkle , and by dozens of small objects  --  statuettes , figurines , china , pictures and frames  --  that picked up the light and relayed it from one shiny thing to another . " A cheerful room , " said Abraham Lockwood . " She needs it . She 's an unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In her room . She stays in bed all morning . The rest of the day she just steadily imbibes her whiskey , sip by sip . " " Why is she unhappy ? " " Too long a story . I 'll go up and say hello to her and be right down . You do n't want to stay for lunch ? We can have it alone . She wo n't be coming down . " " No , I have a lot of things to attend to . " She was back in five minutes . " My cousin wants to know if you ever knew someone named Robert Millhouser , lives in your part of the world . "  | " It 's a Lyons name . Nesquehela County . No , I do n't know the party . " " Just as well . She did n't try to hide her distaste for Mr. Millhouser . Sit down , my dear , and do n't kiss me . This is a sinful house , but not our kind . Here women kiss women and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember hearing that a long time ago . And this is such a cheerful room . Do you know where I heard it ? In Washington , when 1 was a young army officer . That was one of the first times I heard of Mrs. Sterling . Is she your cousin , or her husband ? " " She 's a double cousin , by blood and by marriage to another cousin . " " It wo n't be long before brothers and sisters marry in this town . " She laughed . " I do n't know if they 'll ever marry , but that explainswhy some of them never marry anyone else . Please sit down now andlet 's have our talk . " " Very well . " " We 've avoided this , but I ca n't put it off any longer . Are yougoing to settle some money on me ? Is that what you intend to do , orare you planning to give it to me quarterly ? I really have to know . " " I did n't realize you were in difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't answering my question , and I know you must havethought about it . " " I 'd rather do it quarterly . " " How much can I count on ? " " Well  --  fifteen hundred a quarter ? That 's five hundred a month . " " Five hundred a month ? Is that everything ? " " Do n't you think that 's a lot of money ? " " No . I would n't think so if it was over and above the upkeep of my house , the servants . Five hundred a month , my dear ! I have children to educate , all sorts of expenses to meet . I could do it on a thousand a month . " " I thought you had a buyer for your house . " " 1 have , but that money does n't come from you . " " Oddly enough , I consider that it does , " he said . " But I wo n't go into that now . " " Do go into it , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have been able to take the house away from you . It was bought with money stolen from me . " " You know better than that . I 've owned the house for years . How could you ever prove it was bought with your money ? " " I think it could be done , but since I do n't intend to try , the question need n't come up . " " But it has come up . " She paused . " I see . You consider the house  |p147a  sort of a settlement . Well , I do n't . Harry gave me the house , but on the other hand , I turned my money over to him to invest . Your claim would surely never take precedence over mine . " " It 's a point of law that neither of us know much about . My impression is that if Harry had lived he 'd have had to make restitution , and that if I could show that he had transferred title to you after he 'd committed a crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a question of ethics that should concern you . " " Ethics ? What about your ethics toward your mistress ? Whatever 's gone before , my dear , I 'm your mistress . " " Yes , but you could end that any time you felt like it . " " I can , and now I do . I warned you , my dear . I asked you if you could afford me . I said to you , in these exact words : Locky , are you that rich ? ' And you said you were n't going to court me with greenbacks . Woo me , I think you said . And you said you could n't buy what you wanted from me . What did you mean by that ? I was never certain . " " I do n't know . " " I took it as a great compliment . " " That was how I meant it . " " Then what has changed ? Your greenbacks could n't woo me , but did you expect to have me as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress ? A woman that you hid away somewhere and went to bed with when you wanted to ? There are those . Harry had one . But who will ever know how much money he spent on her ? A lot more than five hundred a month . If I had your money and you were my fancy man , I 'd give you more than five hundred a month . Oh , it 's a good thing we had this conversation now . " " Yes , it is . I thought we loved each other . " " Of course we do , Locky my dear . And I thought I would never give myself to another man . But you 're so frugal . Just because I 'm a lady is no reason why I must live in Manayunk and do my own housework , send my children to the public schools . You do n't seem to understand any of this . I did n't even marry Harry for love-in-acottage , you know , and I 'm much too old and wise for that now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I know a few . Ca n't you give me a million dollars ? " " No . " " Oh , I thought you could . I always thought you could . I was so happy that day , that first time . A man who could make me want to give myself to him , and who was going to make me safe and secure . You misled me , Locky  --  but I forgive you . Fortunately I 'm at an age when no one man can ruin my life , at least not because we'vep148shared certain pleasures . I 've always had a great curiosity about men , and they 've always been attracted to me . Yes , it was a very good thing we had this conversation . " " You must be careful . " " Why ? " " Well , your curiosity . It could get you into trouble . " " My dear , I 'm in mourning . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " " A widow can see as many men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's when the gossip starts . . . Oh , my friend is back from his trip around the world . I had a note from him . " " The doctor ? " " I never said he was a doctor . That was your guesswork . Truthfully , Locky , are n't you a little bit relieved that we can chat like this ? We 've been as intimate as two people can be , but now that it 's over , is n't it a relief ? I never did like you , remember . I trusted you , and I did love you , but this is the first time I ever felt that I liked you . There are two dear old people here in Philadelphia that have a wonderfulfriendship , and I 've always heard that years ago they had a passionate love affair . Got over it , rode out the scandal , so to speak , and now they 're just the dearest friends . You and I might be that kind of friends some day . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , all right . I do n't think our paths will cross much anyway , once I settle down . " " Settle down to what ? " " Settle down to the arrangement I thought I had with you . Well , I hear my cousin moving around and I think it would be polite if I went up and chatted with her . Goodbye , Locky dear . I 'm sorry you wo n't stay to lunch . " He was eased out with such finesse that on the sidewalk he did not know which way to turn , and when he got his bearings and headed east he had a bewildering sense of having been the loser in a financial transaction , although his intelligence told him that the reverse was true . He had lunch alone in an oyster-house and later paid a call on Morris Homestead , with whom he was opening an account . " I saw you at the station , " said Morris Homestead . " You and Martha Downs and your boys . I had to leave my boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chat . How is Martha ? We have n't seen her . " " She seemed well . Bright in spirits . " " You can always count on that with Martha . And brighter than ever , now that a certain eminent physician has returned to town . Nop149one has any illusions left about old Harry , but Martha has a few things to answer for too . Did she behave herself this summer ? She was a neighbor of yours , was n't she ? " " It 's a very quiet , unfashionable place . No high life . " " Martha can supply it if it is n't there . I 've always said about Marthathat where there 's so much smoke , there must be some fire , and I do n't think Kingsland Rawson was the first to feel the , uh , glowing embers . I never trusted myself with her . " " Is that so , Morris ? " " Nothing you could put your finger on , but always that sly look , that double-entendre . Sometimes the double-entendre was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time remembering the innocent meaning . I do n't know . One of these days Martha 's going to go too far , and she 'll find that things you say and do as a young woman are n't always very becoming in an older one . Her family are n't going to pick up after her forever . " " I guess I hardly know her well enough to comment . " " You do n't , and you 're fortunate . Now you take Alice Sterling . Do you know Alice Sterling ? Cousin of Martha 's ? Cousin of mine , for that matter . " " I 've only heard of her . Never been introduced to her . " " Alice is eccentric , we all know that . Drinks like a fish . Has some of the oddest birds for friends , that sponge off her in every way possible . And yet Alice through it all is a perfect lady , and she does n't antagonize people as Martha does . Alice became a widow very young , and it would n't surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her day . Out of loneliness , do n't you know ? Oh , nobody knows what goes on there , or what Alice really thinks . But everybody knows what Martha thinks . She says whatever comes into her head , cruel things , sometimes , and indiscreet when they 're not cruel . I know I 'd never trust Martha with any secret of mine , and poor old Harry had to take up with that woman in New York just to have someone to confide in , to talk to . " " There was more to it than that , though , was n't there , Morris ? " " Well , of course I assume so . You mean the primrose path of dalliance . Yes . That , too . But poor old Harry was driven to it . Companionshipthat he never got from Martha , but could get from Mrs. What 's Her Name in New York . " " Oh , I thought Harry and Martha were very companionable . " " If you got that impression you must have got it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Harry . " " Harry never mentioned Martha to me. "  | " Too much of a gentleman . He never mentioned her to me , either , but of course I could see for myself . Will you take a cigar , Locky ? " " Yes , I 'd enjoy a cigar , thank you . " He took a cigar out of the proffered humidor , ran it across his upper lip . " Ah , this is n't one of your toofers . " " Toofers ? " " Two for a nickel . " " Oh . Oh , no . Mr. Middleton keeps me supplied . I 'll send you a box of them next month , if I may . Mr. Middleton gets a shipment of the leaf once a month , and these are made up to my special order . Hope you do n't mind if the box has my name on it . Little personal touch , you know . Form of vanity , of course . Now then , down to business , Locky , eh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy some . " " Nichols Sugar ? Nichols Sugar . Oh , yes . Yes , I know of it . Let me see what we have on it . " He reached for a little silver bell , but Abraham Lockwood stayed his hand . " I can tell you all about it . I 've been studying it for quite some time . I meant to go into it last spring , but in the confusion of poor Harry 's death I withdrew from trading , and that decision has cost me a nice potential profit in Nichols . Now I 'm convinced that  --  " " Excuse mc , Locky . Did n't the court rule against the Havemeyers last spring ? " " Ah , you do know what 's going on in sugar ? " " I was naturally interested in the court decision that dissolved the sugar trust . A very important decision to all of us . How would you have stood to make money then ? " " Nichols Sugar was n't one of the companies in the trust , therefore not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better word for it . These law courts have taken over the management of all industry and commerce in this country . Where are they going to stop , is the question . " " Well , if I knew for sure I 'd soon be a very rich man . As rich as you , Morris . " " I 'm not so sure that you 're not this very minute , " said Morris Homestead . " Between us , just between us , I did n't gain anything by poor old Harry 's manipulations . I 'm sure that you lost some , but so did I , Locky . Never let friendship mix with business . I came to his rescue two years ago when you turned him down . " " When I turned him down ? But I never did turn him down . I refused to go into one or two things with him , but I never turned him down for a loan , if that 's what you mean . Did he tell you that I refused to come to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took your part . But then I lent him a fair sum . Friendship . He had no right to expect you to do anything for him on that basis , and I told him so . My position was different . I was his closest friend , his oldest friend . You 'd only known him as a classmate in college , not as boys together and so on . Now it appears that he lied to me . " " Yes , he lied to you , as he did to me and apparently to a great many others . " " We were victimized . Poor old Harry . A very good business man until he turned to evil ways , and then he did n't know how to be a crook . " " I came to the same conclusion , although in a roundabout way . No , I never refused Harry a loan . I would have , mind you , but he never asked me for one . Knew better , I guess . " " But why did he tell me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris . He wanted to prove to you that old friends are best . He 'd tried to get money from a new friend , me , but that new friend had n't come through . " " Yes , that 's it , Locky . A devil , was n't he ? Diabolically clever , to no good purpose . A bullet in the brain . " " Would you object to telling me how much you lent him ? " Morris Homestead hesitated . " If you 'll treat this as confidential  --  seventy-five thousand dollars . " The impression Homestead had been giving was that he had lost a sizable chunk of the Homestead millions . " Seventy-five thousand , " said Abraham Lockwood . " Well , that did n't hurt you much , did it ? " " Not judged as a sum of money , no . Not in relation to what I have left . But I 've never experienced a total loss before , Locky . When I 've been the loser I could always salvage something . I hate to lose money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never . Except to Harry , I did . And he proved the wisdom of my lifelong rule . Lend money unsecured , say goodbye to it then and there , all of it . " " You give away a lot of money . " " We do our share . But when we give away , let 's say fifty thousand dollars , we know what the money 's to be used for . We take a good long time before we decide , and the beneficiaries have to prove to us that the money is n't going to be wasted . So in a sense we retain control of the money , even when it 's an outright gift . But if a man came to me for fifty thousand dollars , partly secured , I would refuse him . Unsecured , partly secured , or fully secured , I seldom lend money , because money you lend becomes money that you relinquish control of . The borrower can do what he pleases with your money . And you might find that you 'd lent a man money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then use that money to , say , buy control of a company you were interested in . " " Has that ever happened to you ? " " Oh , no . It never has , but it could . It never will if I can help it . Money is power , Locky . You know that . But it 's power that can be turned against you , even your money , if you do n't control it . We 've given money to charity in the form of securities , many times , but we always retain the voting rights . How easy it would be for some trustee to vote my stock against my best interest , and regrettably how many trustees there are that would do just that . " Abraham Lockwood was full of new admiration and respect for his old friend . It was a pleasant as well as a vaguely chilling surprise to discover that Morris Homestead thought about money ; pleasant , because  it put them on common ground ; chilling , because in the thirty years he had known Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some money matter , and they would not now be where they were , about to get together in a businessventure . " You 're a very shrewd man , Morris , " said Abraham Lockwood . " I have nothing else to do . " " Nothing else to do ? Why , you 're a sporting man , and an art collector . A philanthropist . All those things . A social leader . " " There are twenty-four hours in a day , Locky . Some of the activitiesI 'm best known for take only a matter of minutes of my time . But uppermost in my mind is always  --  I 've never talked about this . Well , I 've said this much , I might as well finish . Our money , the family money , I 've never thought of as my own , only my own . It came to me from both sides of my family , you know . When I was thirty-seven years old a very considerable sum was concentrated in my care . My capital was doubled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been right to say that I did n't care much for business affairs . I had more than ample means , more than enough for a man of my tastes and my few extravagances . But then I came into a second large inheritance , and the money ceased to be what it had been  --  the wherewithal to live as I liked to live . All that new money , that extra money , was a responsibility , and put together with the other money , the whole thing became responsibility , if you see what I mean . Until then , it was my fortune , that had come to me from my father . But when I inherited from my mother , the two fortunes becames one , and all my responsibility . Not only did I stop thinking of it as wherewithal , money to pay my bills . But it was suddenly not my money at all . I was only the custodian of it . There were my children to think of . The very least I could do was take care that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the Bible . " He smiled . " The first thing I did , the first thing that happened to me , soon after I came into the second inheritance  --  I became stingy . All my life I 'd been given , or bought , the best of everything . I 'd been raised , as they say , in the lap of luxury . But overnight I became stingy , and that lasted for a couple of years . Although I was twice as rich as I 'd ever been , I did n't buy a new suit of clothes , a new pair of boots , a new hat , for two years . I went over household bills with a fine-tooth comb . Why was our meat bill so high last month ? When did we drink all that wine ? That sort of thing . We 'd always paid our bills quarterly , but for two years I paid them annually so that I 'd have the benefit of that interest . For almost two years I gave no money to any new charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my mother had contributed to in her lifetime . It was n't that I did n't want to be thought an easy mark . It was just that I could n't bear to spend money . " Then I began to see what the trouble was . I was afraid of that money . Afraid of money ? No . Afraid of the responsibility . Afraid I would do something wrong or foolish . And then I realized that I had been doing something very foolish , if not exactly wrong . In my stingy period I had also been so timid that I had n't been investing my income . One of my managers  --  I have several who manage various things for me  --  finally came to me and pleaded with me . Invest that cash , he said . Money that 's not promptly reinvested is dead money . Dead . Dead . Dead , he kept repeating . And then he made me realize that instead of accepting my responsibility , I 'd been shirking it . He proved to me that my timidity , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , at least . He knew what I 'd been going through . A man named Leon Spruance , a very understanding fellow . Morris , ' he said . He knows me well enough to call me by my first name . Worked for my father . Morris , it 's time you did somethingconstructive with this money . ' And then he showed me that I not only had failed to make proper use of my income from my own point of view , but that I 'd been retiring large sums of money from the general welfare of the country . That was some years after Cooke 's failed , but greenbacks were still untrustworthy , and Spruance showed me that I was unpatriotic not to put my cash to work . Unpatriotic , and taking a risk with those greenbacks . Property , that was the thing . Property , not cash . Property , whether it was securities , real estate , mortgages . But property , not cash . " Ever since then I 've known what I want to do , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No risky speculations , but keep putting the money back to work . I would n't go into Nichols Sugarp154with you , Locky . I can afford not to speculate , but I know you 're not satisfied with what you have , so you must take some chances . Right ? " " Right . " " When you have as much as you want , the goal you 've set for yourself , I might be able to let you in on some less speculative things that come our way now and then . But I think I 'm correct in assuming that you have n't quite reached your goal . What is it ? Five million ? " " A bull 's eye , " said Abraham Lockwood . His goal until that momenthad been three million , but he was in a mood to flatter Morris Homestead . " Meanwhile we 'll be overjoyed to have you as a client . I always hoped you 'd come with us some day , " said Morris Homestead . " I 'm going to make sure to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as shocking as a slap in the face . There were so many large and small things Morris Homestead could have offered Abraham Lockwood : a partnership in the Homestead firm , an invitation to join the Philadelphia Club , an invitation to his house for a weekend  --  all sorts of things . A box of cigars was exactly the present that Abraham Lockwood sent to the Swedish Haven policechief at Christmas . But on the way home the sting went out of the slap ; Morris Homestead was Morris Homestead , and the bestowal of his confidences regarding money was , for Morris , a high compliment ; the box of cigars belonged in another context ; and as for the partnershipor the club membership or the weekend invitation , they would never be forthcoming , and now Abraham Lockwood knew it . The knowledge had an oddly satisfactory effect ; it more firmly fixed his base in Swedish Haven . He was no longer a young man , and quite by accident he had been shown where he belonged for the rest of his life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he soon understood that Morris never would have guessed that his friend Locky was waiting to be asked to become a part of the Philadelphia life . Abraham Lockwood never ceased to wonder at the thinking and even the feeling that he believed to be his own , only to be duplicated by Morris Homestead 's thinking and feeling . Morris Homestead 's Concern was a protective position over what he already had , while Abraham Lockwood recognized his Concern for an acquisitive enterprise ; nevertheless in both cases there was this desire for money for more than its own sake . Abraham Lockwood could see , as at a distance but now at least faintly discernible , the established dynasty , the sons of George and Penrose who would possess the same feelings of responsibility and noblesse oblige that governed the actions of Morris Homestead . Abraham Lockwood could even look back uponp155himself from the vantage point of the second generation to come , and see himself recognized as the major architect and builder of the dynasty . ( At least they would so recognize him if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an accomplished fact two generationshence . Of that he was certain , although ten years earlier he had been less confident that the scheme could be accomplished in such a comparatively short time . The change toward optimism was a result of several developments ; the world in general was moving faster than ever before ; and as he contrasted himself with his father there was already progress at so rapid a rate that it was very nearly incredible . In sum , the Lockwoods in three or four generations would have achieved the position that the Homesteads had reached in more than two centuries . Once again Abraham Lockwood saw the inevitability of his remainingin Swedish Haven . Several times he had been tempted by Philadelphia  --  or , more accurately , had weakened in his determination to remain in Swedish Haven . But some circumstance had always taken him back . A box of cigars , a grasping woman  --  these had redirected him homeward now . A small gesture of generosity became a kindly banishment ; the demands of an exciting but expensive mistresshad been a momentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Concern , and he had retreated to Swedish Haven before the last syllable of " a million dollars " was out of her mouth . When the cigars arrived Abraham Lockwood wrote a carefully courteous note of thanks , then , in a rare moment of ironic humor , gave the cigars to Schissler , the night constable . Morris Homestead was something of a constable , in his way . " We do n't see much of you these days , " said Morris Homestead . " No , Morris , " said Martha Downs . " And I know you count the hours from one time to the next . " " Well , no , hardly that , " said Morris Homestead . " But you do seem to have disappeared . " " I 'm still in mourning , " she said . " It 's only seven months since Harry died . I 've got five months to go . " " Of course . You do n't consider this a party ? " " I consider it a bloody bore . Do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small talk with me . " " Well , it is n't intended to entertain us . It 's for the young people . " " And it 's a bloody bore . It is for you , and it is for me . Awkward ,  |p156silly  little girls . Pimply , ungainly boys . Except for that Lockwood boy . You know him , of course . Abraham Lockwood 's son . The most interesting boy here , and the only new blood . " " Why is he so interesting ? " he said . " He 's on the verge of handsome , but interesting ? Why ? " " Why is anybody interesting ? He 's different . He 's good-looking . He dances well . " " You have n't proved your point . " " I know . I 'm just talking as a woman , looking at the new crop . You men do that . Perhaps you do n't , Morris , but most men look at the young girls . Well , I look at the boys , in exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And come to the conclusion that if you were thirty years younger you 'd set your cap for George Lockwood ? " " My cap . My nightcap . " " Very amusing , Martha . Luckily the boy is safe . " " Yes , from me . But not from those daughters and nieces and cousinsof ours . He is n't safe from them , yet . " " Why not ? " " Because he 's still young enough to be unspoiled . To do a nice thing on an impulse . Instinctively . And without counting on any reward . What he did for my Sterling . " " What did he do for your Sterling ? " " Has n't his father boasted about it to you ? I 'd have thought Locky would have told you all about it . " " You do n't like Locky ? " " I do n't dislike Locky , but I know what he is , and so do you . " " Well  --  I suppose I do . But I 've always liked Locky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he heard about Harry , he asked Sterling to be his roommate at St. Bartholomew 's this year . The other boys may have wanted to be nice to Sterling , but George Lockwood was the one who did something . " " I had n't known that . It 's very difficult for boys to be nice to each other . They think it 's a sign of weakness . " " Of course they do . But George Lockwood was a little bit better than that . And it was n't because Sterling was one of his best friends . Sterling as a matter of fact had been stand-offish toward George . But he was so touched that when he told me about it he cried . The one boy that he 'd least expected to be nice to him . George Lockwood . " " I had no idea , " said Morris Homestead . " I also did n't know that it would matter so much to you . " " No , you did n't . I believe that . You 've always known all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do when you find that people refuse to be pigeonholed . " " I do n't know , Martha . What do you do ? " " That 's a fine boy you have , Locky , " said Morris Homestead . The men were having cigars and a moment of male privacy at the St. Bartholomew 's commencement . " Thank you , Morris . He is a good boy . I have high hopes for him . " " I know you 'll want to see him a Zeta Psi , but I hope you do n't mind if we try to pledge him . " " Thank you , Morris . But he 's not going to be a Zeta Psi or St. Anthony either . " " What have you got against fraternities ? I 've always thought you were a very loyal Zete . " " I have nothing against them . But George is going to Princeton . " " To Princeton ? By his choice , or yours ? " " Mine , originally , but now he wants to go there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't see how you can say that . You went there knowing nobody , and you made Zeta Psi and The Ruffes . " " I made Zeta Psi because they thought I was one of the other Lockwoods . I never denied it . I let them go on thinking it . " Morris Homestead laughed . " No . They let you go on thinking they were thinking it . We always knew you were n't one of those other Lockwoods . So Zeta Psi must have known it too . " " Are you sure ? All these years ? " " I 'm sure about us , and I 'm almost sure about Zeta Psi . With us it was the first question that came up . Is he one of those Lockwoods ? ' All we had to do was to inquire , and we found out that  --  well , we found out too much , I guess . " " About my father ? " " Yes . " " You 've known that all these years and never mentioned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioning it now , and I would n't if you had n't first . I have never repeated anything that was said in The Hall . " " Zeta Psi took me in in spite of that . I 'm very touched . " " So did The Ruffes . " " Did all the Ruffes know about my father ? "  | " Some of them did . Those that belonged to St. Anthony certainly did , and I imagine those that belonged to Zeta Psi . Does this change your wanting to send your boy to Princeton ? " " It would have , but it 's too late now . The boy wants to go to Princeton and not to Penn . " " You never quite understood some things , Locky . Shall I speak frankly ? " " I wish you would . We have been . " " Then I shall . Some years ago I made a few very tentative inquiries about putting you up for the Philadelphia Club . I was n't very hopeful , but I thought you might like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , so I never mentioned it to you . " " Morris , will my boy make it ? " Morris Homestead spoke gently . " No , Locky , he wo n't . You can spare him that , at least . I 'd be very glad to help him elsewhere , but if he ever mentions the Philadelphia Club , discourage him . Memories are too long . When he has a son , the son will stand a good chance . The old-timers will be dead and gone , but some of the same men that do n't want you will still be around to oppose your son . " " You all knew about my father , all these years . " " Yes . It 's so easy , you know , Locky . We know all about each other , so that when someone like you comes along our curiosity is aroused and in a very short time we pool our information . I 'm sure the same thing happens in Swedish Haven and Gibbsville . " " Indeed it does . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had any illusions about myself , but I could have embarrassed George . " " I 'm very fond of the boy , Locky , and I would n't want to see him embittered over a thing like that . Too many good qualities . " " How do you know about his good qualities , Morris ? " " Well , I could say that I 've seen him take all these prizes here today . And I 've noticed that he has good manners . Nice-looking . But best of all I like what he did for Sterling Downs . " " You astonish me , the things you know . Where did you ever hear that ? " " Oh , Philadelphia gossip is n't always mean , Locky . " " But Sterling Downs will get in the Philadelphia Club , wo n't he ? His father was a crook , a liar , and had a mistress in New York . My father  --  well , I guess I see it . " " Harry was a bad egg , but that 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . If your father had been one of those other Lockwoods , we would n't be having this conversation . You do see that , do n't you ? " " Yes . "  | " Furthermore , a lot of us liked Harry , and I was one of them . We do n't like what he did , but we still like him . That 's one of the nice things about Philadelphia . Some day your grandsons will benefit by that . Make haste slowly , Locky . " " Why did you say that ? " " Because you 're right . We are inbred , and George or at least his son may furnish us some new blood . " " That is not what I have in mind for him , Morris . " " How interesting . Would you care to tell me more ? " " No . " " But there is a lot more . I feel sure of that . " " Indeed there is , my friend . Indeed there is . " " Well , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as though all of Abraham Lockwood 's plans were laid out on the lawn before them , the whole Concern exposed to view , and Morris Homestead was too much of a gentleman to steal a look . " Adelaide is looking well , " said Morris Homestead . " She must be very proud of George , too . " " Yes , she is looking well . " " Ca n't say the same for Martha , but then Adelaide 's life and Martha'sdo n't bear comparison . " " No , I guess not . " Morris Homestead smiled . " I should hope not . Martha 's getting a little old for that sort of thing . " " What sort of thing ? " " She has an affinity , and everybody knows who it is but nobody will come right out and say it . " " Then how do they know ? " " That 's the great mystery , how those things become known . My own theory is the way they sit together , and the way they avoid each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . Martha and her affinity would never go away together  --  on the same train , that is . But I 've watched these two . At a party he 'll never sit with her first , always with others first . Then when he does finally sit with her they 're much too formal for two people that have known each other all their lives . When they 're alone together at a party they seem to have nothing to talk about , but they have to sit together for a little while , because not to would be too obvious , too . " " I would n't know what to talk about with Martha . " " But you 'd find something , and in any event I 'd expect you to have to make conversation with Martha .

Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upturn . That 's how I happened to know about her and her affinity . It corroborated my other evidence , my observations . But I also happen to know that Martha has all the money she needs to meet her expenses . " " How much , for instance ? " " Well , can only guess , but on her present scale of living , she must spend close to a thousand a month . " " Would the gentleman give her , say , a large settlement ? Securities ? Twelve thousand a year is two hundred thousand at six percent . Would he settle that much on her ? Two hundred thousand ? " " He could . I do n't know that he has . In our small world it might be wise to , instead of paying her by the quarter or semi-annually . A goodsizedsettlement , a quarter of a million , would be better than having to pay her bills several times a year . No use reminding people to be suspicious . " " What if she took that money and then told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never ! He can do that to her , but she would n't dare do it to him . No one would ever speak to her if she did that .

Not very practical , either . " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Abraham Lockwood . " The bird in the hand ? No , Locky . There may be more than two birds in that bush . What I 'm implying is that she may stand to get more than twice two hundred thousand , eventually . " " lie could n't just put it in his will . " " Nothing as broad as that .

And besides , Mr. Lockwood may not understand . " " I delight in taking you down a few pegs , old boy . You 're so confounded deistic , if that 's the word I mean . " " It is n't .

" And now , Morris , run along , will you please ? I 'd like to have a word with Mr. Lockwood . " " Well , what 's he done that the Rector has to take him aside ? " Morris Homestead , genuinely mystified , left them . " I thought I ought to speak to you beforehand , Mr. Lockwood . The fact is  --  your wife and Mrs. Downs have had words .

I went upstairs to use the toilet and she was just coming out .

I just went in , and when I came out she was still there in the room , waiting . I started to walk past her , but she stood in my way . " Please let me pass , " I said to her . " Not before I give you a piece of my mind , " she said . Maybe those were n't her exact words , but something like that . " Not before I give you a piece of my mind .

HE reader will do well to remind himself that the Lockwood Concern existed throughout the better part of a hundred years withoutever being given a name . It was for that reason that George Bingham Lockwood always had difficulty in establishing the point at which his awareness of the Concern began . At first vaguely and then clearly he saw that his father had plans for him , that there was some sort of governing theme to his father 's direction of his life ; but where other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for the law , that for medicine , to train certain muscles for use in certain games , to cultivate alliances with some contemporaries but not others , George Bingham Lockwood could find in his father 's counsel only the recurring wish that George  --  and the younger brother Penrose  --  would always remember that home was Swedish Haven , Swedish Haven was home . Repetition of this wish , expressed in various forms , eventually resulted in George 's recognition of SwedishHaven residence as his father 's rather modest hope for his family 's future , and this was not difficult to understand , since at St. Bartholomew'snearly every boy accepted  --  or was already rebelling against  --  the eventual return to some place ; a city , a town , an estate , a plantation , from which he had come , and which was more than the middleclassidea of home . The place , whether it was a populous one or an isolated establishment in the country , had implications of family continuityand prestige , and even those boys who were already rebelling against returning showed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter . This was as true of the city boys  --  New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore  --  as of those who were listed in the school roster as coming from Prides Crossing , Massachusetts ; Towson , Maryland ; Purchase , New York . The city boys invariably referred to some rural postoffice or estate name in a tone that was more meaningful than the manner in which they spoke of their town residences . It was never strange to them that Georgep165Lockwood should come from a place called Swedish Haven ; the names of their own places were just as strange . ( The boys from Chicago and Buffalo had a worse time of it in that respect ; the Chicago boy was nicknamed Chicago , and the Buffalo boy , Buffalo  --  both nouns being considered sufficiently disparaging for prep school nicknames . ) His father 's one wish seemed moderate enough and happened to conform with George 's own intentions as of his final years at St. Bartholomew 's and the beginning of his career at Princeton . He was still young enough to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather in Richterville , to collect the presents from his Richterville relatives , to go to the young people 's dance in Gibbsville ( his social stock in Gibbsville had jumped immediately upon his admittance to St. Bartholomew 's , to which no Gibbsville parent had ever applied in behalf of a son ) , to eat the rich , heavy Pennsylvania Dutch sweetmeats , to go on sleighing parties for chicken-and-waffle suppers . The Philadelphia parties were fun , but less fun than the festivities closer to home . The Philadelphia parties were fun because George Lockwood knew that girls liked him ; the Lantenengo County parties were fun because girls liked him and he did not have to be so careful about being too attentive to them ; in Gibbsville everyone , without exception , knew who he was . The knowledge did not make for universal cordiality ; some of the boys and some of their fathers were hostile or indifferent ; but they knew who he was , and though he was young , he was old enough to like being recognized . Life in Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At St. Bartholomew 's the boys and their parents were discouraged by Arthur Francis Ferris from all ostentation . George Lockwood and everyone else could name the boys whose families actually owned ocean-going yachts and racing stables , but there were other boys whose families could afford yachts and great stables and chose not to . Consequently , in among the inconspicuous nonspenderswho possessed great wealth were mixed the sons of those who could not be called wealthy . There was so much wealth at St. Bartholomew 's that it was not fashionable , and any display of it was considered gauche . It was hardly a democratic school in its attitude toward candidates for admittance ; social prestige , which was usually accompanied by more than adequate means , was the first requirement for entrance , and a George Lockwood never could have got in the school without the support of Morris Homestead and Harry Penn Downs , who vouched for Abraham Lockwood as an acceptable if not quite accepted man . No Jew , even of the Sephardic aristocracy , and no Roman Catholic , even of Maryland or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nineteenth Century . No native of the vast area between Charleston and New Orleans was able to satisfy Arthur Francis Ferris 's social standards , nor would he let in any son of a brewer ( distillers ' sons were acceptable if they belonged to the landed gentry ) , a meat packer , a Baptist , a dentist , an Italian , a South American , or a grand opera singer male or female . A clergymanwho wore gaiters had a better chance of getting his son into St. Bartholomew 's than a minister of the gospel who wore a business suit , and a surgeon 's son had a better chance than the boy whose father was a pill-doctor . The president of a country bank got his son on the St. Bartholomew 's list a full generation ahead of the cashier of a large city bank . ( None of this deterred Jews , Catholics , Alabamans , brewers , meat packers , Baptists , dentists , Italians , South Americans , tenors , Presbyterians , general practitioners or bank cashiers from trying to have exceptions made . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the elite , thereupon made a conscientiouseffort to treat them all alike . He was a despot , but one who insisted on democratic practice among the boys . They dressed alike in a non-military uniform that was similar to the Etonians ' ; they made their own beds and washed out of tin basins ; they formed ranks to march from classroom to classroom . Ferris 's strictness in regard to the possession of cash made money illegal tender , and the richest boy in school at any given moment was the one who had earned the most privileges , which consisted of intangibles such as a boy 's being allowed to study in his room instead of going to study-hall ; leaving his light on after nine-thirty . Sometimes that boy had been George Lockwood , although he had never been elected Head Boy of his class or of the school , and the democratizing process had left him eagerly receptivetoward the admiration , friendliness , obsequiousness , and adulationthat awaited him in Swedish Haven , Richterville , and Gibbsville . The growing conviction that he was brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attractiveness to girls and older women , had together created an egotism that needed that which St. Bartholomew'shad denied and which on his home ground was freely given . In such a state of mind he entered the freshman class at Princeton , already committed to one condition of the Lockwood Concern . He would never live anywhere but Swedish Haven . At Princeton the slightly spurious democracy of St. Bartholomew 's vanished immediately . Only one other boy  --  " Chicago "  --  had come down from St. Bartholomew 's to Princeton ; all their classmates had , gone to Harvard , Yale , and  --  the Philadelphians  --  to Penn . But there were eight St. Bartholomew 's boys in the sophomore , junior , and senior classes , and they had taken their proper place in the Princetonp167social hierarchy , thus easing the way for G. B. Lockwood and Anson " Chicago " Chatsworth . The formidable front presented by boys from Lawrenceville and The Hill made for a defensive unity among St. Bartholomew 's boys that was not necessarily the case at Harvard or Yale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially fond of Lockwood or Chatsworth in prep school now called on them and made a point of being seen publicly with them . These old boys had already made friends among the few graduates of Groton and St. Paul 's at Princeton , and Lockwood and Chatsworth were tentatively absorbed into this smallish group . This cabal bypassed the boys from the New Jersey and Pennsylvania high schools and the lesser prep schools , and since their existence as an informal homogeneous unit always contained the threat of formal organization , they were always able to get themselves elected to one or two of the more fashionable eating-clubs . A club composed of their own number would automaticallyhave become as prestigious as any in the university , with an inevitable loss of some prestige for the clubs already in being . In his first week at Princeton George Bingham Lockwood discardedthe notions of democracy that had been superimposed at St. Bartholomew 's . It was ridiculously easy summarily to dismiss onethirdof the freshman class on account of their clothes ; but by the same token it was easy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good taste in clothes would never be enough to overcome handicaps that were not so readily apparent . In his first few days George Lockwood became friendly with a welldressedclassmate about whom he knew nothing except that he came from New York , obviously had money , and in spite of his blue eyes was of French extraction . The classmate 's name was Edmund Auberne . It came as a jolting surprise to learn that the man 's name was O'Byrne , that he was an Irish Catholic and a graduate of Fordham Prep . George Lockwood never had heard or seen the name O'Byrne , never had heard of Fordham Prep , and felt slightly tricked that he had not immediately recognized an Irish Catholic . As he saw more of O'Byrne and heard his quite deadly comments on undergraduates and faculty George Lockwood recovered his confidence in his judgments ; if he could have heard the Irish name at the start of their friendship he would have known that such sardonic humor did not belong in the makeup of the kind of man O'Byrne had seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently friendless . A secondjolting surprise came with the early discovery that O'Byrne had an older brother who was a guard on the football team . ( Football was not then played at St. Bartholomew 's , and George Lockwood had never seen an intercollegiate game . ) O'Byrne therefore was not quitep168so lonesome as George Lockwood had guessed him to be . O'Byrne , in fact , constantly upset George Lockwood 's notions of him ; he was an entirely new experience for George Lockwood , whose personal knowledge of the American Irish was limited to the laboring men who lived in Irishtown , on the mud flats of Swedish Haven , and to a few others who worked around horses as coachmen and hostlers . O'Byrne 's father was a Dublin-educated doctor , presumably a successfulone . Edmund , or Ned , had been abroad twice , and he spoke of Bourke Cockran , Chauncey Olcott and Agnes Repplier as visitors to the O'Byrne house in New York in an impressed way that preventedGeorge Lockwood from confessing that he had never heard of them . Ned O'Byrne 's whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who did not believe his friend was in any position to be critical of a system that would automaticallyreject him . But when O'Byrne mentioned one day that his father was on a special train , touring the West with one of the Vanderbilts , George Lockwood once again was confused by this fellow who would not stay in a pigeonhole . O'Byrne was also a good card-player , who quite frankly expected to supplement his allowance while at Princeton with his winnings from the undergraduate body . ( In the first semester of freshman year O'Byrne won more than five hundred dollars from Anson Chatsworth alone . " We must do everything we can to help him pass his examinations , " O'Byrne told George Lockwood . " You help him with his math and I 'll help him with his Latin . That chap is going to make up for my old man 's stinginess , these next three years . " ) George Lockwood was prepared to terminate his friendship with O'Byrne whenever it was expedient to do so , but he found that as he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of young men with only the common tie of a hope to graduate in 1895 , he would seek out the company of O'Byrne and two others . Those three were his choice , and finally O'Byrne was his choice of the three for two apparently contradictory reasons : he could relax with O'Byrne , and O'Byrne stimulated him . The other two of the three were Ezra Davenport and Jack Harbord . Davenport was having a second try at freshman year , having flunked out on his first try , with the distinction of having failed his examinations in every subject . His indignant parents , unable to expendtheir wrath on Princeton University , put Davenport in a crammingschool from February to August , and he was readmitted to college as a freshman . At nineteen he already had the look of a voluptuary , and he would grow into the look as time went on . He was a cigarette-fiend and affected the habit of speaking with a cigarette stuck on his lower lip , which bounced up and down as he spoke . Hep169was constantly pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He cocked his head at an angle , to keep the cigarette smoke out of his eyes , and this habit made him appear to be attentive to conversations in a worldly-wise way . It took George Lockwood the better part of four years to realize that Ezra Davenport had attached himself to him , that Ezra had a weak stomach for alcoholic beverages and that his conquests of the female sex were largely , although not entirely , imaginary . Merely by flunking out of college in his first freshman year Ezra Davenport had established himself among the hellers of the campus , and his prematurely dissolute appearance gave credibility to the role he had assumed . He was actually a meek little fellow , an only son of two good-sized fortunes , who was unequal to the demands put upon him by his father and mother . In other circumstanceshe might have become a hotel clerk or an ineffectual member of the clergy , but he too was a victim of a Concern . Jack Harbord was as correct as Ezra Davenport was wrong . It was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first nineteen years of his life , a little harder to believe than that Davenporthad become so worldly in the same time . Harbord was a rich boy , well dressed , gentlemanly manners and all , but in his case the accoutermentsof wealth and upbringing were reassuring ; Jack Harbord would never use his money or his personality for sinister purpose . He was a tall blond with a magnificent physique , and he was elected class president without opposition , almost entirely on a fixed smile and a seemingly inexhaustible willingness to be helpful and good . " A very good man , Harbord , " said O'Byrne . " All good . No evil at all , not a bit . Does n't need an ass-hole like you and me . I understand he was born with his second teeth all in place . A good , good man , our Jack . " " But that 's what he is . Why are you sarcastic about him ? You prefer him to Davenport , do n't you ? " " He 's not as trustworthy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How can you trust a man that 's so good ? I can trust Davenport because you know what a bounder 's going to do . A pious son of a bitch like Harbord , watch out for his kind . He 'd hang me , given the chance , but you would n't understand that . " " Then explain it . " " Wait , and I wo n't have to explain it . He wo n't put a rope around my neck , but I 'm not counting on his vote . I voted for him , by the way . " " Why ? " " Because I wanted to make it unanimous . Harbord knows howp170many are in the class , and one vote against him would have caused him loss of sleep . He 'll be a strong class president , very good with the faculty . But he would n't have been quite as good if everybody did n't love him . At heart a despicable , cruel coward . The infant Jesus protectme from the like of him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just do n't be seen with him too often , George . The clubs get the impression that you 're not going to be a good club member if you have a close friend that 's not going to make a club . " " Is n't O'Byrne going to make a club ? " " His brother 's club , probably . But not any that you or I want to be in . Your father was a Zeta Psi . Well , that 's what Ivy used to be . A word to the wise , George . After you 're in , see as much of him as you feel like , but take my advice . " George Lockwood said nothing to O'Byrne , not so much from a desire to spare O'Byrne 's feelings as from a reluctance to concede that O'Byrne had been right about Harbord . O'Byrne 's sardonic accuracywas not an endearing quality , and the friendship very nearly was terminated a few weeks after Harbord 's conversation . George Lockwood managed to see O'Byrne frequently , but he contrived to have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , George ? Have you decided ? " " Decided what ? " " Just about the only thing we decide for ourselves here . Is it going to be Ivy , or one of the others ? " " That 's something it 's not good policy to talk about . " " I know , I keep hearing that . Everybody I 've talked to says the same thing . " " If you go around talking about it , you 're going to be left out in the cold . " " Oh , it 's no problem for me . Either I ride in on my brother Kevin 's broad shoulders or I do n't ride in at all . Kevin 's a wild man , you know . If 1 do n't get invited to join his club he 'll resign , not that he has a strong feeling of brotherly affection , mind you . No . But we have a younger brother that Kevin wants to go to Princeton , but Jerry thinks he 'd like to go to Yale , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . So you might say I 'm in the middle , with nothing to worry about . It 's all up to Kevin . You have a different kind of a problem . " " Have I ? " " Oh , yes , but if you do n't want to talk about it . . . I thought it would do you good to get it off your chest . " " I have a younger brother , too . At St. Bartholomew's. "  | " How old ? " " Four years younger . " " But four years at St. Bartholomew 's , he may want to go to Yale or Harvard . Or Penn . " " No , he 's coming here . " " Ivy or no Ivy ? " " No matter what . " " Hmm . You wo n't even mention the name . That 's good form , George . You must have been taking lessons from Jack Harbord . " " Oh , go to hell . " " Very good form . It 'll be Ivy for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There 's a poker game tonight . Chatsworth 's room . Will you be playing ? " " No . " " Be glad to take your I. O. U. " " I 'd be glad to take yours , but I have to study . Do n't you ever study ? " " In the mornings , sometimes . I was a day scholar , so I 'm used to getting up early . I 'll never like it , but I 'm used to it . . . Oh , I have a bit of friendly advice for you , chum . " " What ? " " Do n't get too chummy with Davenport , at least till after the club elections . He does n't pay his gambling debts . At least he does n't pay me , and I 've been given to understand that he still owes some from last year . That 's going to come up during the club elections , and you do n't want them thinking he 's your bosom companion . As far as that goes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll never be able to say I renege on gambling debts . " To the eternal confusion of the undergraduate body , at club electionsEzra Davenport and Jack Harbord were taken into Ivy , George Lockwood and Ned O'Byrne into Orchard , and inoffensive Anson Chatsworth got nothing . George Lockwood did not receive an Ivy bid ; Ned O'Byrne did not receive a bid from his brother 's club . Lockwood and O'Byrne each had three other bids besides Orchard 's . Davenport 's only bid was from Ivy ; Harbord had a bid from every club in the university . " I have n't seen Kevin , " said O'Byrne . " But I hope he 's holding his temper . " In George Lockwood 's junior year the contingent of Eastern Pennsylvaniansat Princeton were joined by a freshman named David Fenstermacher , from the town and county of Lebanon , and from Mercersburg Academy . George Lockwood did not notice Fenstermacheruntil they took the same northbound train from Philadelphia during the Christmas holidays . Fenstermacher was very young ( but allp172freshmen looked young ) and George Lockwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Princeton-pennant sticker on Fenstermacher 's valise , a bit of ostentation that had never appeared on George Lockwood 's luggage . The freshman and the junior were standing near each other , waiting for the train platform gate to be opened . Ordinarily George Lockwoodwould have ignored the younger man , but in the spirit of Christmas he opened the conversation : " I see you go to Princeton . " David Fenstermacher smiled . " Yes I do , Mr. Lockwood . I 'm from Lebanon . " " I see . Then you change trains at Reading . " " Yes sir . " " Take the Fort Penn train there , I guess . " " Yes sir . I get off at the Outer Station and take the Fort Penn train and I 'm home inside of an hour . I 'll be glad to get home . " " Why ? Do n't you like Princeton ? " " Oh , I like it all right but I like home better . I have n't had a square meal since September . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a freshman , are n't you ? " " Yes sir . " " Where did you go before Princeton ? " " Mercersburg for two years , before that , Lebanon High . " " Oh , then you have a lot of friends at college .

" " You were pointed out to me by a friend of mine , a boy from Gibbsville . Alden Stokes . He was in my class at Mercersburg and I 'm going to visit him during the holidays .

You going to Gibbsville . But I guess Gibbsville is n't very different from Lebanon . I 've never been to Lebanon . " " Gibbsville is livelier . They have more parties than Lebanon .

" " Well , if I do n't see you during vacation  --  back at Princeton . " " Goodbye , Mr. Lockwood . It was a pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's Eve , at the Gibbsville Assembly . George Lockwood 's " drag "  --  the girl he had invited to the dance  --  came down with an attack of boils on ChristmasEve , and he attended the function as a stag . He thus was free to keep his card as full or as empty as he wished , to have a cigar when he felt like it , and to visit the punchbowl . He was having a glass of punch when he was accosted by Red Phillips , a Gibbsville acquaintance . " I 've been looking all over for you , " said Phillips . " Not in the right places . " " Listen , George , there 's a girl here from Lebanon says she would like to meet you . You know her brother or somebody in the family . Are you free for the second waltz after intermission ? " " Let me look . Yes . What name ? " " Eulalie Fenstermacher. "  | " Oh . Her brother 's a freshman . Is she pretty ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second waltz after intermission George Lockwood presented himself , was introduced to Miss Eulalie Fenstermacher , and swept her out onto the dance floor . " You were very nice to my brother . Thank you . " " The pea-green freshman ? Oh , he was a nice kid . " " You sound like Methuselah . You 're going to wish you had n't some day . " " Not I. It 's girls that want to pretend they 're younger , not men . Have you started to lie about your age , Miss Fenstermacher ? " " No , and I never intend to . I just wo n't tell anybody . " " You wo n't have to . You 're either nineteen or twenty now , so I 'll always know within one year how old you are . " " You 're so clever , Mr. Lockwood . " " What 's clever about that ? It is n't hard to guess a girl 's age . I can guess any woman 's age , under thirty . Then it becomes more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you go to school ? " " I graduated last June . From Oak Hill . " " Oh , that 's not very far from Princeton . To think that you went to school near me  --  and Lebanon is n't so very far away either . Do you think it 's a small world , Miss Fenstermacher ? " " That depends . " " On what ? " " On whose world you 're talking about . Your world is small . You lived in the same college with my brother for three months , but you never saw him till last week . That 's because your world is tiny . Therefore you make the world itself seem infinitely larger . " " I follow you so far , but I did n't know I was going to get into higher mathematics . Do n't tell me you 're a bluestocking , Miss Fen-stermacher . " " Oh , I would n't try to tell a Princeton man anything . " " Why not ? Just because it 's so hard to educate your Lehigh friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least Lehigh men are willing to learn . " " They 'd better be . They have a lot to catch up on . " " I thought Red Phillips was a friend of yours . " " Well , he introduced me to you , I 'll say that for the poor , unsophisticatedpiece of humanity . Did you go to the ball in Fort Penn the other night ? " " Yes , why ? " " Because now I wish I 'd gone . " " My uncle was on the committee . "  | " Are you fending off a compliment ? I said I wish 1 'd gone . " " I heard you . I did n't know whether you intended it as a complimentor because you wish you 'd been there to tease me . " " Was Red at the ball ? " " Red Phillips ?

When I arrive at your house I sincerely hope you will have got rid of the mandolin players , at least . " " How did you  --  " " Oh , that 's obvious . I 'm sure the whole F. &; M. glee club serenadesyou all summer . " " Did my brother tell you that ? " " Good Lord , no . That would be obvious too . Franklin and Marshall . Lebanon Valley .

" " Oh , I know Hoffners . In Richterville . " " They 're the ones . What do you say to my suggestion ? " " I say no . If you wish to dance with me again , you have to ask Red . I think my card is filled . " " Well , I gave you the opportunity of a lifetime . You ca n't say I did n't . " " I did n't say you could n't come and see me in Lebanon . " " No , you did n't , did you ? Well , when ? " " Spring vacation . My brother 'd be only too glad to invite you , and we have plenty of room . " In August of that summer , his last college vacation , they reached an understanding . An understanding was an unofficial , unannounced engagement to be married , and had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Lockwood wanted to be engaged to her . " Have an understanding , " said Mrs. Fenstermacher . " You can have an understanding till George graduates . That 's always better . " An understanding did not involve the young man 's obtaining the consent of the girl 's father , and the father remained out of the picture until the propitious moment . The custom of having an understanding , which in the lower classes was known as " going steady , " offered most of the advantages without entailing the risk of a publicly announced and publicly broken engagement . Thus it could be said of a young couple , " They had an understanding , but they changed their minds , " and neither party would be marked as jilted . During an understanding a young couple could be together a great deal , but their friends did not entertain specifically in their honor . Mainly what was implicit in an understanding was that the young man and the young woman were already forsaking all others , and only waiting for circumstances , such as time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was something more honorable in an understanding than in an engagement . Mutual trust and confidence was deeply involved . An engagement had the status of a quasi-legal agreement , and a young man was hound by public opinion to conform to the social laws governing engagements . Strictly speaking he was not so bound in an understanding , except by honor and decency and love , and he was technically freer than in an engagement . In many cases the formal engagement came as a relief to both parties , since the restrictions of an engagement were traditionally defined , and both parties knew what they could and could not do . During an understanding , for example , a young lady could be escorted home from a picnic by a young gentleman who was not her fiance-to-be , provided that the fiance-to-be was not at the picnic . But after the announcement of her engagement she would not attend a picnic without her young man . At a ball an engaged young lady deferred to her fiance 's wishes as to her dancing partners , and engagements had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enveloped Eulalie Fenstermacher during the months of her understanding with George Lockwood , and this was acceptable to George Lockwood . Their early kisses , which had led to the understanding , were now timed to the precise point where amorousnesswas about to proceed into eroticism . The young man and the young woman were now so enormously conscious of the implications of marriage that if Eulalie parted her lips , if George put his hand anywhere on the front or the lower part of her body , he or she would withdraw from the embrace . Nor could they permit themselves top177have conversation that mentioned her bosom or her legs . George Lockwood was not a virgin . During his first year at Princeton his father had recommended an establishment in Philadelphia that was the present-day version of the Phoebe Adamson place . " It 's where you 'll be safe , " Abraham Lockwood had said . " But always wash to be sure . " It had not seemed strange to George that his father should know of such a place ; most fathers knew of such places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes with the injunction that a boy of eighteen should stop " flogging the dummy " and when he felt horny to save it for a woman . Once on a visit to Ezra Davenport 's house in northern New Jersey Mrs. Davenport'spersonal maid , a French woman , had taken off her clothes for Ezra and George and rather roughly disposed of Ezra and sent him out of the room while she gently but quickly attended to George . " This Ezra , pouf ! Nothing . He only wish to see me with you , " she said . But she was ugly with her clothes on , and on George 's second visit to the Davenports she was no longer there . Once on a northboundtrain from Philadelphia a heavily perfumed woman wearing an ostrich-plumed hat sat beside George , looked him up and down several times , and put her hand on his thigh , kept it there , then slowly moved it upward and gently massaged him . " Open up honey so I can get inside . " He undid his trousers and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train was slowing down for Reading , when she handed him a calling card . " If you 're in the neighborhood , honey . A high-class place , for gentlemen . " With so much experience in addition to the lore and legends he had absorbed at St. Bartholomew 's and Princeton , George Lockwood was not ignorant of the female body or of the excitements and pleasures to be enjoyed in intimacy with it . He was moreover conscious of an effect he had on members of the opposite sex , conscious of it when frequently they were not . Bold women  --  the Davenports ' maid , the woman on the train  --  seemed to recognize his special interest in them or at least to be aware of him as a comrade in a game . The girls in his own circle , the sisters and friends of his friends , might be less forthrightor generous , or more obtuse , but within the restraints of the conventions they had always seemed to like him more than they did most of his contemporaries . His success with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of his erotic experiences with them , since everything that could be done to deny privacy was being done . Ten minutes , five minutes completely alone with a girl was a rare occasion , even after Eulalie and George had reached their understanding . Girls were constantly watched by mothers , by sisters , by brothers , by servants , and especially by other girls . A maid wouldp178enter a room carrying a feather duster , a brother would come in to look for a book , and a girl 's contemporaries would not even bother to make a feeble excuse . But the closest surveillance was that of the young lovers themselves , by their sharpened vigilance over their erotic impulses . There were times when George knew that Eulalie was letting him make the next , more intimate move , anticipating the hand on her breast , the creeping fingers inside her thigh . She would sit on the sofa , enjoying the liberties he would not take , letting him enjoy them with her until he would take his lips away from hers and they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not be sure how far the suppressed excitement had taken her , or had not taken her , but nearly always at such times she would say , " I love you , " in a way that was meant to be a reward , and a reward which indeed he had earned . There was no doubt for George that he loved her . His curiosity made the familiar tests , and his feeling for her passed them all : wanting to he with her , needing to write her , looking forward to her letters , wanting to confide in her , to tell her unimportant things , using her as a standard of her sex , wanting to protect her , and imagining the riotous pleasures that awaited them , to be followed by tenderness immeasurable . Then there were manifestations that surprised him : he became fond of her brother , wanting only the best for him . He becamejealous of a friend named Mildred Haynes , whom Eulalie saw every day . And always , always , he wanted to talk about her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obviouslywrong , confidant  --  the sardonic Ned O'Byrne . But O'Byrne 's ironic wit was one language ; he also spoke another , that of sympathy ( George now recalled how quickly O'Byrne had understood Ezra Davenport ) and warmth . " I 'm going to have my brother Penrose as best man , but I want you to be an usher , " said George Lockwood in their senior year . " Do n't commit yourself , George . There 'll be a lot of noses out of joint if you have me . " " Fuck them . " " Well , if you feel that strongly about it . " " I do . I 'm not going to have anybody from St. Bartholomew 's . Except my brother , of course . And nobody from Philadelphia . Nobodyfrom Ivy . " " Not Ezra ? He 'll cry his eyes out . " " He can be ring-bearer . I might ask one boy from St. Bartholo-mew 's . " " Chatsworth . " " Yes . How did you know ? "  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shitty end of the stick here , some day they 're all going to be God damned sorry , because Chatsworth is a better man than most of them . " " Why do you think that , Ned ? I agree with you , but we 've never had much to say about him . " " Well , I do n't know . Dignity . Anson Chatsworth was more entitled to a club bid than I was . More so than at least half of those that got in the best clubs . I think it was an accident that he was passed over . You know now how those things can happen . A fellow like Chatsworth , nothing to make him outstanding , and yet eligible for every club here . So by accident no club gives him a bid , because they all think he 'll be in some other club . But he was n't a crybaby , and he did n't resign from Princeton . The opposite of Ezra . I 'm sure Ezra peed his pants when he made Ivy , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to know how he made it . I think he had a great-great-grandfather that was a signer of the Declaration of Independence . " " Chatsworth had an ancestor that was president of Harvard . " " There , you see ? If Chatsworth had gone to Harvard he 'd have been in one of their best final clubs , but here he was left out in the cold . I wish we could get him in our club . " " He would n't come in now . And anyway , I 'm going to have to work hard for my own candidate . " " Your future brother-in-law . You have your work cut out for you . Dave 's a nice kid , but a wish-wash . " " No he is n't , not really . He 'll improve with age . " " George , he 's a wish-wash . He 's a perfect example of a no-bid fellow . Do n't get into a scuffle over Dave Fenstermacher . You 're the only man in the club 's going to be for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but everybody in our crowd is going to think that you only want him because you 're going to marry his sister . Another thing you ought to take into consideration , it wo n't break his heart if he does n't make a club . He must know by this time where he stands . " " You never know , and you always keep hoping . " " Well , I 'll grant you that . You do keep hoping . " O'Byrne laughed . " When I got my bids , for about sixty seconds I thought maybe one of them would be Ivy . " " Would you have taken Ivy ? " " No . For one reason , and one reason only . I could n't learn to stomach Jack Harbord . That mealy-mouthed hypocrite , there 'll never be room on this earth for the two of us . If I heard he was at death 's door I would n't blow my nose to save his life . " " Well , when we leave here we 'll never have to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . You 'll never see me at a class reunion . The last Princeton thing I do will be to usher at your wedding , and then I 'm going to disappear . I 'm heading straight for the Kimberley , to make my fortune in the diamond fields . " " You never liked it here . Why did you stay ? Family ? " " Why else would I stay ? My father . I 'm very fond of my old man . I understand hint perfectly , you know . My mother was determined that at least one of us would become a Jesuit priest , but my father was just as determined we would n't . So he pushed Kevin and me into Princeton , away from the Jesuits , and then my younger brother into Yale . He 's hoping that I 'll follow Kevin into medical school , but he knows it 's a forlorn hope . " " Why is he so much against the Jesuits ? He 's a Catholic . " " He 's a Catholic , but in Ireland he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesuits try to make them feel that they 're hoi polloi . And maybe they are . I think they are , but I 'm a snob . Anyway , there 's always some Jesuit having dinner at our house and my old man has been fed up with them for years , the way my mother worships them . I 've observed on occasion that my old man is also a bit fed up with my mother , though he may try to hide it . " " I 'll tell you something in strict confidence . I think my mother and father really hate each other . I 've never said that to another human being . " " That 's no rarity , George . The number of husbands and wives that hate each other must be appalling , appalling . It 's one of the reasons why you never hear of me going out with a nice Catholic girl . I do n't want to get married , but I 'm soft-hearted and if I fell for a Catholic girl 1 'd hear myself proposing to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe side , I bestow the privilege of my company on Protestant girls and now and then a pretty little Jewess . That should keep me a bachelor for a good many years . But do n't let me discourageyou , George . " " You do n't . Lalie and I are n't like my father and mother . " " Your mother I take it was English extraction . " " No , she was Pennsylvania Dutch , the same as Lalie 's family . " " Oh , but Lalie  --  nothing against your mother , mind you , but inyour mother 's time girls were n't given much of an education . " " Well , my mother had the same amount of schooling as Lalie . Infact , my mother was pretty bright . Is , I should say . She can readFrench and High German , as well as speak Pennsylvania Dutch . " " I see . You mean that you and your father are different . " " Yes . Very different . " " I only saw your father that one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very much alike , but you ca n't tell much from such a short meeting . You did n't look very much like him , but you had some of the same mannerisms . " " He 's all business . " " Well  --  you 're not all monkey-shines , if it comes to that . When you set your mind to a thing  --  " " Are you trying to tell me I 'm like my father ? I 'm not . We 're very different , outside and inside . " " I would n't argue that question . I do n't know what you 're like inside . " " Funny you should say that . " " Why ? " " My brother said that about my father . Nobody knows what Father'slike inside . ' The same words . . . So you 're going to South Africa ? " " Unless I change my mind . You know . Last year I wanted to go to Oxford . I expect to be a citizen of the world , and I thought Oxford would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entree that being an Oxford man gives you . I forget why I gave that up . I guess I fell under the influence of Villon . But now I fully intend to make a great fortune in the Kimberley , buy a steam yacht and equip it with heavy guns and prey on British shipping . In other words , become a pirate . A freebooter . Then maybe be a sort of Patrick Sarsfield , raise hell in Ireland . Every so often we have to remind the English that they 're trespassing . " " Do you really think you 'll ever do any of this , Ned ? " " Well , it takes money . " " I meant go to South Africa . " " That takes money , too . I wo n't travel steerage . I may have to spend the rest of this year playing cards with Chatsworth and Davenport . I wish Harbord played cards , but he promised his mother . So he says . I do n't believe him for a minute . He just does n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chatsworth ? " " Altogether ? I guess about three thousand , but that was n't all clear profit , as you well know . You took your share of it , and I do n't want you to play in May and June , when I open my big final campaign on the Chatsworth bankroll . When you 're in the game the others try to play like you , and it 's a restraining influence on the betting . Davenportespecially . Is your fiancee going to let you play cards ? " " Let me play cards ? It 's not up to her whether I play cards or not . I 'd never ask a woman permission to do a thing like that . I 'd just go and do it . "  | " Well , good for you , and the best of luck , " said Ned O'Byrne . In late winter , following conversations with Lalie and her mother , George arranged to meet Judge Fenstermacher to obtain his consent to the marriage . " You write a good letter , George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a man if he can express his thoughts without committing himself too much . But now you want to commit yourself , do n't you ? " " Yes sir . I wish to ask for Eulalie 's hand in marriage . " " Yes . Well , you 've had this understanding for some time now and both of you have a level head on your shoulders . I 'm going to give my consent . I 've looked into your background , and I 've observed you in my house . Yes , you may marry Eulalie , and I trust you 'll both be very happy . " " Thank you sir . " " Mrs. Fenstcrmacher informs me that you wish to announce the engagement after you graduate . " " Yes sir . " " What do you plan to do for a living , George ? I know your people are comfortable , but what do you expect to go into ? " " I have n't decided . My father and I 've been talking , but I have n't decided . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go right out and get a job . Your family are comfortable . You 'll wish to make your home in Swedish Haven ? " " Oh , yes . " " Well , I 'm in favor of that . We 've always lived here , and I hope David will settle here when he graduates . I want him to study law at my college , Dickinson , and then settle here . Did you ever hear any of your family speak of William L. Lockwood ? " " No sir . " " Never heard of William L. Lockwood . Well , William L. Lockwoodwas one of the founders of my college fraternity . Sigma Chi . " " Is that so ? " " Thomas C. Bell , James P. Caldwell , Daniel W. Cooper , Benjamin P. Runkle , Franklin H. Scobey , Isaac M. Jordan , and William L. Lockwood . They were the founders of Sigma Chi , at Miami Universityout in Ohio , the year 1855 . They were all members of Deke with the exception of Lockwood . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that so ? " " Be nice if you could trace some connection with William L. Lockwood . That would make you and me fraternity brothers , so to speak . I wish they had Sigma Chi at Princeton . They did have , butp183then Princeton did away with fraternities . I would have liked David to be a Sigma Chi . Is your father a Mason , George ? " " No sir . He 's a Zeta Psi . " " Well , you do n't mention the two together . " " Oh , I thought you mentioned Sigma Chi and the Masons . " " Not exactly together , though . I guess you did think I was coupling one with the other , so that 's my fault , but that 's neither here nor there . Your Grandfather Hoffner 's a Mason , that I do know . " " Is he ? " " You did n't know that , George ? Yes , you have very good Masonic connections on your mother 's side . We 'll have to speak about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about David at Princeton . You have these clubs at Princeton , so it is n't as if I could write to the Sigma Chi chapter , but David 's told me he does n't expect to join a club . George , now that you 're coming in the family , I wish you 'd have a talk with David , make him see how important it is to mix with people . " " It 's a ticklish subject , Judge . " " Ticklish subject ? How so ? " " Well , I belong to a club  --  " " I know you do . One of the best , I 'm told . " " Thank you . But if I talk to David about the advantages of joining a club , he may get it in his head that I 'm trying to get him to join my club . " " Well , what if he does ? I 'd be satisifed to have my son and my sonin-lawin the same club . If you ca n't both be Sigma Chi 's ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge . I do n't decide who gets invited to join . I can blackball somebody , but that does n't mean I can invite somebody . You know how these things work . " " Of course I do . But this club you belong to is only a club , not a secret organization like Sigma Chi , or the Masons . It 's just a club . " " We have secrets , just the same as if we were Alpha Beta Gamma Delta . " " Then what David 's been trying to tell me is that you 're not going to invite him . It is n't that he does n't want to join . Do you realize what you 're doing to the boy ? Do you realize that three of his friends from Mercersburg are sure to be invited to clubs , and he is n't ? " " They ca n't be sure , his friends . They wo n't know till the last minute . " Judge Fenstermacher tapped his heel on the carpet , ran his fingers around his neck between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , then came back and stood before George Lockwood . " Let me hear it from you in plain language . You ask permission to marryp184my daughter , but you 're doing nothing to help her young brother . " " Judge , I 've done all I could to help David . " " All you could ? What have you done ? Sat idly by while other young pipsqueaks keep him out of your own club . Do you think any member of my family would ever set foot in such a place after that ? Do you think Eulalie would visit your club ? Or I ? Or Mrs. Fenster-macher ? " " I 'm sorry , Judge . I do n't know . I only know that I 've been trying for nearly a year to get David invited to our club . But I 'm not the one that decides . It 's a committee . " " Damn your committee ! " " He may be invited to join some place else . " " I do n't want him to join some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-in-law has any standing with his friends . If not , then I do n't want him for a son-in-law . " " Well , then I guess that 's that . " " What do you mean , that 's that ? " " I 'll have to tell Lalie that you 've turned me down . " The meeting had taken longer than was expected by Lalie and her mother , who were waiting in the sitting-room , and when George Lockwood joined them their nervously expectant smiles vanished . " What happened ? " said Lalie . " He says to wait ? Is that it ? " said Mrs. Fenstermacher . " He thinks I should have got David into my club . " " Oh , dear me . I was hoping that would n't come up . David understands , but I knew Judge would n't . Oh , dear . " Lalie went into his outstretched arms . " Do n't cry , " he said . He turned to her mother . " I 'm over twenty-one , Mrs. Fenstermacher . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , but do n't do anything  --  rash . " " It wo n't be rash , " said George Lockwood . " I can support her . I 'm very well off . " " It is n't that , George . Let me deal with Judge . " It was a Sunday . They had all been to church , but they had not yet sat down to the large Sunday dinner that always followed attendance at divine service . Now they heard the judge 's deep voice . " Bessie , come here , " he was calling . " You two stay here , " said Bessie Fenstermacher . George Lockwood never knew what was said between the judge and his wife . He sat with Lalie in the sitting-room for fifteen minutes behind the rarely closed doors . They comforted each other with the words and sentences of love , with kisses and tears and the common anger . Then there was a knock on the door , the door was opened , andp185Bessie Fenstermacher , half-smiling , said to them : " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Dinner 's ready . " " Mama , what did you tell him ? " said Lalie . " I talked to him . Do n't ask me any more questions . Dinner 's ready , " said Bessie Fenstermacher . She rested her hand on George 's arm . " You have sense , George . " " All right , Mrs. Fenstermacher . " " He 's a judge , remember . He has to be right , so do n't put him in the wrong . Be polite , like nothing happened . " " I 'll do my best . " There were only the four of them for dinner . The judge stood up while carving the roast chicken , which gave him something to do . " George , can I give you light or dark ? " " I like the white , " said George Lockwood . " I see you have plenty of sweet marjoram in the filling , Bessie , " said the judge . " Maybe George does n't like so much sweet mar-joram ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that 's lucky . Lalie , you pass George his plate , please . And George , help yourself to the mashed and sweets . The gravy 's there in front of you . Lalie , you want the second joint ? " The conversation at the beginning was on the topic of food , always a reliable and inexhaustible topic among the Pennsylvania Dutch . The meal consisted of the large main course and dessert of hot mince pie and ice cream . George and the judge drank coffee with their meal , the women drank water . But though there were only the two courses , the amount of food was prodigious . Meat , candied sweet potatoes , mashed white potatoes , red beets , stewed corn , mashed turnips , creamed onions , and endive in olive oil , with side dishes of cranberries and a slaw . Thought was put away while the two men and two women concentrated on emptying their platters , and conversation never got far from the principal topic , the business at hand . Distractingtalk was never encouraged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Prattling children would be asked , " Did you come to eat or did you come to gabble ? " and it was within the rules for a talky child to lose a piece of pie to a non-talking neighbor . " That 'll teach you not to talk so much , " the parents would say . ) After dinner the men went to the judge 's den for cigars . " When do you have to go back to Princeton ? " said the judge . " On the 3 : 1 o . " " Change at Reading , and then change at Philadelphia ? What time does that get you there ? Around supper , I guess ? "  | " It 'll be after supper . " " Well , we better pack a box for you to eat on the train . " " Oh , I 'll be all right , thank you . I 'll manage . " " On a Sunday it wo n't be easy , but that 's up to you . You wo n't get to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train after another , it seems a shame . " " It was worth it to me , sir . " " Well , I hope so . We had our angry words , but now it 's all over and done with . " " But there 's something I want to say , Judge . " " Is it about that other subject ? My son ? " " Yes sir . " " Then do n't say it . I consider the matter closed and I do n't wish to talk about it , now or ever again . I gave a promise . " " Very well , sir . " " Some day you 'll have a son of your own  --  no , I wo n't say any more . You make Lalie happy and I 'll be satisfied . . . Well , George , I think there 's the team to take you to the depot . Yes , there 's the barouche . Is your valise all packed ? Oh , you did n't have one , of course . All day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Well , thank you , Judge . " " No hard feelings on either side , George . " " No sir . " But back at Princeton , away from Lalie 's pretty face and miserable tears , George Lockwood had his first doubts , and he found that curiously , perversely , they were centered on Bessie Fenstermacher . Until this too-eventful day he had regarded her as a round , meek woman who obeyed her husband and kept house for him , who was still obeyed by her children but would soon yield even that authority . But on this day , in a quarter of an hour , she had created another picture of herself ; and as George Lockwood thought about it , he recalled that it was Bessie Fenstermacher who had made the decision to have an understanding instead of an engagement . And now he thought back upon the scene in the sitting-room , with Lalie in tears of disappointment . Tears of disappointment , indeed , but whose disappointment ? It came to him now that Lalie had immediately looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her unhappiness was as much due to her mother 's disappointment as her own . And then , he recalled vividly , the words Bessie Fenstermacher had spoken : " I was hoping that would n't come up . David understands , but I knew Judge would n't . . . Let me deal with Judge . " The round , meek woman had anticipated possible trouble , had apparently discussed the club problem with David  --  and was fully confident of her ability to deal with the judge.  |p187The  round , meek little woman , who dominated her family 's lives , and who so often reminded George Lockwood of Lalie . It was natural enough for a mother to remind you of her daughter , for a daughter to remind you of her mother . George Lockwood went for a walk , but he knew as he left the dormitory that he would be looking to see if Ned O'Byrne 's light was on . He knew that he hoped O'Byrne 's light would be on , and it was . O'Byrne , who roomed alone , was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on a hassock . He was in a shabby wool bathrobe , smoking a calabash pipe . He held up a book . " I was just thinking about you . " " What are you reading ? " " It 's Missionary Travels in South Africa , by David Livingstone , You remember , Dr. Livingstone , I presume ? ' I presume ? " " Why would that make you think of me , for the Lord 's sake ? " " Because I 'm doing my homework , getting ready to go to Africa . And you 've been spending the day in Lebanon , P-A , doing your homework . So you 're back , eh ? Sit down and tell me about it . There 's a cigar in the top drawer there . I was saving it for after breakfast , but you smoke it . That way I 'll have to smoke me pipe , which I 'm trying to break in but with very little success . " " I have a cigar , thanks , if you 'll give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match-safe , to your right on the desk . What went wrong , man ? Something did , I can tell . " George Lockwood related the incidents of the day , but withheld the newly forming doubts . " Well , " said Ned O'Byrne . " Is that all you have to say ? " " Oh , no . Ay me ! For aught that ever I could read , / could ever hear by tale or history , / the course of true love never did run smooth ; / but , either it was different in blood ,  --  / or else misgraffed in respect of years ,  --  / or else it stood upon the choice of friends ,  --  / or , if there were a sympathy in choice , / war , death , or sickness did lay siege to it , /making it momentany as a sound , /swift as a shadow , short as any dream , / brief as the lightning in the collied night ,  --  ' " " All right . " " Shut up . Lightning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfolds both heaven and earth , / and ere a man bath power to say , Behold ! ' / the jaws of darkness do devour it up : / so quick bright things come to confusion . ' I 'm finished , but I gave you the whole damned thing instead of just the usual course-of-true-love . " " Thank you very much , it was heart-rending . "  | " The mother seems to exert a great deal of authority , George . I 'd keep on the right side of her if I were you . She 'll come in handy some day , and it 's plain as day she 's all for you . There 's one person I 'm glad I 'm not tonight . " " Who 's that ? The judge ? " " The girl . Lalie . " " Why ? " " Oh  --  it 's hard for me to say . " " Have n't you got some quotation from Shakespeare that covers it ? " " I 'm sure there is one , but I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl that 's had a pretty bad day , all in all . You 'll want to hit me in the mouth for this , George , but I do n't think you love her . " " I do n't want to hit you in the mouth . " " Then for God 's sake tell her  --  no , do n't . " " Tell her what ? " " Is this freeze you had today , is it going to last ? Maybe better give it a couple of days , but you have n't been talking like a man in love , and the fair , honest thing is to put an end to it before more harm is done . I wish you had n't come here tonight , I swear to Christ I do . I nearly always take the woman 's side , in spite of knowing that they damn well can take care of themselves . All right , then I 'll take your side . " " Do n't take any side . " " I 'll take your side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , but they 're wiser and smarter than we are in these things . So look at it from our point of view . Supposing you did break it off . If you do n't love her , you 're doing her a favor . If it turns out you do love her , which I doubt , you 're the principal loser . Why are n't you arguing with me , protesting that you do love her ? You know why , George . You ca n't make yourself lie to yourself . " " I do n't know what I think , or what I want to do . " " Write her a letter tonight and sleep on it . Pour it all out and see how much of it you believe in the morning . You know we have one thing in the Catholic Church that I 'd like to hold on to . Confession . I stopped going when I came here , but I think it helps a lot of poor souls to go on living . They pour it all out once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the box feeling that they have a new start . Absolvo te , the man says , and for fifteen minutes it 's a new world . Till you bump up against a pretty ass in the trolley car , but then your impure thoughts and desires are on a new slate , not the old one . Very comforting , and I miss it . "  | " You 're all a bunch of hypocrites . " " I do n't doubt it for a second , but the purest of angels for fifteen minutes or so . Not a worry in the world , not the slightest concern . Will you write the letter , George ? You may learn something about yourself . " " What ? " " I do n't know . It 's you learning about you . You may find out that you love this girl much more deeply than you realized . I consider myself a very wise fellow , but it 's my own belly-button that fascinates me the most . By the way , Chatsworth 's in trouble . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him you were away for the day . " " A woman ? " " A girl in New Brunswick . He told her he was from Rutgers but her old man tracked him down to here . She 's knocked up . They want a thousand dollars , and the most Chat could raise was around four hundred . He has till tomorrow night to raise the full amount . " " Well , let 's go over and see him . I can let him have the money . " " I gave him two hundred , that was all I had . I 'll win it back . Do you want to go over now ? " " Sure . " " He wants to get the money in secrecy . There were only a few he wanted to ask . You can write a cheque for six or seven hundred , and get it cashed ? " " Yes . Or more , if necessary . " " Well , then let 's go over and see Chat . Is it cold out ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long has he been screwing this girl ? " " Since last fall , he told me . " " I can go to the bank in the morning . Is Chat taking the full responsibility ? How does he know he 's the one ? " " We talked about that . He said the father honestly did n't want to make trouble . The girl was n't virtue itself . But she 's knocked up and the father 's a poor man and wants Chat to pay for the kid . He says he wo n't blackmail Chat . " " That 's what he says , but what 's he doing ? " " Well , he knows Chat 's graduating in June and he may never see Chat again . Oh , Chat takes the blame . He does n't deny anything . But there 'll be hell to pay in Chicago , and if the faculty finds out , Chat 's through here . " " Yes . Well , get a wiggle on . " " I 'm ready . " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two flights and knocked on his door , but there was no answer.  | " Fell asleep , " said O'Byrne . He opened the door gently . " No one here . " " Wait a minute , " said George Lockwood . " The wardrobe . " Both doors of the wardrobe were open , all the suits and coats that belonged in it were on chairs and on the cot . Ned O'Byrne and George Lockwood went in , and now they saw Anson Chatsworth . There was a noose of dirty clothesline about his neck and tied to the thick cross-bar of the wardrobe . He was wearing trousers and a shirt without a collar . " Mother of God , " said O'Byrne . " Jesus , " said George Lockwood . " How did he do it ? " " Cut him down , George , " said O'Byrne . He stood over the wastebasket and vomited . " I have n't got a knife . He 's dead , is n't he ? " " Yes , he 's dead . That you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handkerchief . " We ca n't leave him like that . " " Do n't we have to ? For the police ? " " Ah , fuck the police . What a way to talk , in the presence of ... " He did not finish the thought . " I want to untie him , but I ca n't . " He suddenly was forced to vomit again . " George , I 'll go for the police , if you can stand to be alone . " " You go , and I 'll wait in the hall . " " You sure you do n't mind ? I 'll do this again if I do n't get some fresh air . " " Go on , Ned . I 'll stay out in the hall . You 're sure he 's dead ? " " I know he is . I saw one once before . " He departed , and George Lockwood stood in the hall to wait . Then quite slowly he began to cry , and he put his head on his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I-Icy , Lockwood ? Are you drunk ? " George Lockwood did not turn to face his questioner . " George ? What 's the matter ? " the voice asked . George Lockwood shook his head , and the unknown student put his hand on his shoulder . " George ? Can I help you ? What is it , old fellow ' ? Do n't cry , George . Tell me what it is . " " Chat , " said George Lockwood . " What ? Chat , did you say ? " " He 's dead . Do n't go in , " said George Lockwood . " Chatsworth is dead ? You mean he 's dead in there ? " George Lockwood stopped crying . " Oh , hello , Bender . Have you seen O'Byrne ? " " I saw him downstairs , he was in a hurry . " " Yes . Chat hung himself . He 's dead . We found him . "  | " Chatsworth ? I saw him after supper . He 's dead ? You mean he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , Benson . I mean Bender . I always get you mixed up with Benson , I 'm sorry . " " That 's all right , George . Come on down to my room and wait there . Do you want me to get you a glass of water ? " " No thanks . Yes ! Will you get me a glass of water ? Please ? I did n't know I was thirsty . I would like a glass of water . You do n't have any whiskey or anything like that , have you ? " " No , I do n't drink . At first I thought you were drunk , though . " " I know . " " I 'll get you the water and maybe you 'll feel better . " " Thanks very much , Bender . " Bender with his tumbler of water and O'Byrne with a constable arrived together . " Are you all right , George ? " said O'Byrne . " We sent for a doctor , too , but I know it 's no use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some half dressed , some in nightshirts , some in bathrobes . They heard the constable say , " He 's dead , all right . Where 's the two boys that found him ? " " He wants you , George . You and O'Byrne , " said Bender . The constable was trying to control his own agitation . " You 're bothhere at the college , ai n't you ? I seen you before . What 's your names ? " " O'Byrne . " " Lockwood . " " Lockwood and O'Burns ? The senior class ? " " Yes sir , " said George Lockwood . " We 're both seniors . " " And this poor fellow 's name you say is Chatworth ? " " Chatsworth . Anson Chatsworth . He comes from Chicago , Illinois , " said George Lockwood . " And the two of you come in and found him hanging here . What time was that about ? " " Less than an hour ago , " said George Lockwood . " Less than an hour ago , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask next . " Are you his roommates or  --  no , there 's only the one cot . You 're friends of his ? " " Yes sir , " said O'Byrne . " Uh-huh . There was no sign of life when you seen him ? " " They would n't have let him hang , you damned fool , " said a voice in the growing crowd . " Who said that ? I 'll run you in , " said the constable . " Ca n't we cut him down ? " said O'Byrne . " Is there any reason why you should leave him like that ? "  |p192Action  was something the constable understood . " Yes , I guess it 's all right to cut him down . You . O'Burns . Give me a hand . " " Not me ! " " You 're the one wants him cut down , " said the constable . " I do n't want to touch him . " " Make way , please . " A voice with authority was heard . A middleagedman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go to your own rooms , fellows . Disperse . You 're only in the way here , " he said , but having said it made no further effort in that regard , and no one left . " O'Byrne . Lockwood . You discovered him ? " " Yes sir . " Revercomb entered the room . " Good God , let 's get him down . In the name of decency , let 's get him down . This is grotesque . Constable , ca n't you cut that rope ? " " I was just getting ready to , but I need help with the corpse . " " Well , I 'll help . Lockwood , you stand on his left side and I 'll standon his right . Constable , you cut the rope , and Lockwood , you and Icarry him to the cot . Good God . Good God . " George Lockwood shivered upon touching his dead friend , but he did as he was told and they put Chatsworth on the cot . " Cover him , " said Revercomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mc , " said O'Byrne . " Well , I do n't blame you , but let 's open a window . What do we do now , Constable ? I mean the legalities. " " 1 sent somebody for Doc Perry . " " He can take as long as he likes , " said Revercomb . " He 'll do no good here , or any other doctor . " " Well , I guess if I write down some more witnesses the next thing is send for the undertaker . " " O'Byrnc and I , and Bender , " said George Lockwood . " We were the first here , " " As far as you know , " said the constable . " Listen to him ! " said a student . " As far as you know . ' " " I warned you before , I 'll run you in , " said the constable . " Shut up , whoever said that , " said Revercomb . " Show some respect , please . And you , Constable , bear in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that I was sent for , Professor . " " Oh , all right , all right , " said Revercomb . " What shall we do ? Lock this room till the undertaker gets here ? You fellows did n't find a note or a letter , did you ? " " I never thought to look , " said George Lockwood . " Neither did I , " said O'Byrne.  | " Yes , there ought to be some kind of a letter , " said the constable . " They usually leave a letter . Though not always . The women are more apt to leave a letter , those that can read and write . If anybody finds a letter , or a note , turn it right over to me . " " You mean now ? " said George Lockwood . " Of course , now . I 'll look in his pants pockets , and Professor , you go through his desk . " The four searched , but no letter was found . " Lockwood , O'Byrne , there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to your rooms and try to get some sleep . The authorities will notify us if they want you . Inquest , I suppose . I 'll stay here till the undertaker comes , and that 's about all we can do to-night . " " What about his family , Professor ? " said O'Byrne . " I 'll attend to that . We will . We 'll get off a telegram as soon as we have more details . Goodnight , now , boys . " " Goodnight , sir , " they said . Out in the cold air the friends of Anson Chatsworth walked aimlesslyin the shadows of the bare elms . " Do you want to come back to my room ? " said O'Byrne . " All right , " said George Lockwood . He had two roommates , Lewis and Loomis , but they were not his close friends ; propinquity had not created intimacy . " I do n't think I 'll sleep , do you ? " " Well , you can stretch out in the Morris chair . You ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christ's-own of an exhausting day . " In O'Byrne 's room George Lockwood said , " Would you ever do that , Ned ? " " Meaning what Chat did ? I 've thought about it . I 'd never hang myself . That 's because Judas Iscariot hanged himself , I guess . " " I had a friend at St. Bartholomew 's , his father was a friend of my father 's . He shot himself in the head . I think I 'd shoot myself in the heart , or take poison . I would n't hang myself , either . Especially after tonight . He should n't have looked that way . " " He was n't thinking about how he 'd look . " " But I would . Would n't you ? A bullet in the brain they say  --  " " I know , I know . " " I 'd care about how I looked , and I 'd care about the shock to people that saw me . " " I guess I would , too , and I guess for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chat was a pretty simple sort of a fellow . " " Not stupid . " " No , of course not stupid . But not used to worrying , not used top194thinking about things the way you and I are all the time . He was n't used to trouble , and this thing he got into was too much for him . " " I guess that was it . " " Hear the bell . " " Uh-huh . The end of the day . Now it 's Monday . The new week is starting . But not for Chat . " " No , not for Chat . It 's all over for Chat . " " Jesus , I 'm tired . " " Go to sleep . Do n't fight it . Sleep , George . " " Think maybe 1 will . " He was asleep before O'Byrne put the blanket over him . Their testimony at the inquest was brief , and they were treated with consideration . George was therefore surprised when O'Byrne , on leaving the borough hall , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there ! " " It was n't as bad as I thought it 'd be . " O'Byrnc looked behind them and said : " I got this in the mail , Tuesday after Chat died . With it was $200 , the same money I gave him that Saturday . Read it . " Ned :  --  It 's no use . Even if I get the money that will only be the beginning of my troubles . I could not face my family after bringing this disgrace on them . Thank you for being a true and loyal friend . This is goodbye . A. C.They had stopped under a street lamp so that George Lockwood could read the note . He handed it back to O'Byrne. " 1 do n't know whether to keep it or burn it . In a way it 's evidence , " said O'Byrne . " Yes , but they gave a verdict , the only one they could give . Chat hung himself while of unsound mind , or whatever the wording was . You did the right thing , Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have asked a lot of questions . It 's better to let the whole thing die down . " " If the girl 's father keeps quiet . " " No use making trouble now . " " With Chat 's family . " " Chicago 's a long way from New Brunswick . I just do n't think he 'll make any more trouble . What would be the use ? Even if he went to Chicago Chat 's family would n't have to believe him . It would never hold up in court , I do n't think . " " I wish I knew the girl 's name , " said O'Byrne . " What would you do ? " " I probably would n't do anything , but it does n't seem right . Youp195realize that you and I are probably the only ones here that really knew why he did it . " " That 's a blessing . Let 's keep it that way . " " All right . Shall we take an oath ? I solemnly swear that I will never reveal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I solemnly swear the same thing , " said George Lockwood . Their oath was tested on the following day . Each of them was called into Revercomb 's office on the campus . " Lockwood , Mr. Chatsworth is coming here in the next few days and he 'll want to know all there is to know . Is there anything you would care to tell me ? " " No sir . " " Nothing at all you want to tell me ? You know more than you told at the inquest , of that I 'm sure . " " Why are you sure , sir ? " " Do n't answer me with a question . You know why Anson took his life . " " I have nothing to say , sir . " " Well , I 'm not going to make any threats . But you were under oath at the inquest . " " All they asked me was to describe what I saw . " " And to tell the whole truth , et cetera . You 're fencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your opinion , sir . But I was away all day Sunday , in Lebanon , Pennsylvania . The last time I saw Chatsworth was the Friday before he died . " " Do n't start building up a big alibi , Lockwood . All I care about now is whether you have anything to tell me that might be of some comfort to Chatsworth 's family . " " No sir , I have n't . " " By inference , of course , you know something that would not be a comfort . Well , all right . You may go . " " Thank you , Professor . " George Lockwood got to his feet , took a few steps toward the door . " Lockwood , " said Revercomb . " Sir ? " " I had a visitor last week . A man from New Brunswick . " " Did you sir ? From Rutgers ? " " You know he was n't from Rutgers , not this visitor . He was a niceman . A working-man , and he spent his own money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Chatsworth . He even told me why . " " He did ? "  | " Yes . I want you and O'Byrne to know that when Mr. Chatsworth comes here , I 'm going to tell him about my visitor , and after that it 's up to him , Mr. Chatsworth . We 're not taking any official position in the matter . Chatsworth is dead . But I want you and O'Byrne to know that personally , not officially , but speaking for myself , I ca n't help admiring your loyalty to your friend . Carry that into the world when you leave Princeton . " " I 'll try sir . Thank you . " George Lockwood and Ned O'Byrne compared their experiences they had had in Professor Revercomb 's office . They were very nearly identical . " I asked him to tell me the name of the man from New Brunswick , " said O'Bryne . " And ? " " He said it was none of my business . He was right , too . " " I 'd just as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking it over , me too . " The death of Anson Chatsworth had served to divert the young lovers from the distressing effects of George 's scene with the judge . Lalie was eagerly and perhaps excessively sympathetic ; her thrice weekly letters in the fortnight following Chat 's suicide made no mention of her father , her brother , or of the anguish she had been caused by her father 's outburst . Instead she wrote of the sadness of death , the mystery of suicide , the advent of spring and new life and hope . The first of these letters was welcomed ; the others seemed forced , insincere , strategic , and for a stretch of five days George could not bring himself to answer her . His silence disturbed her ; she sent one of her rare telegrams : MISS YOUR LETTERS HOPE ALL IS WELL LOVE . He showed the telegram and explained the circumstances to O'Byrne . O'Byrnc shook his head . " I 'm sorry , George . I do n't want to say anything . " " I do n't want advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm not giving any . " " I just want to talk about it . " " You want to get me talking about it . Please do n't ask me to , because whatever I say will be wrong . It 's your problem . Write a letter . Write several letters . Write a half a dozen . And do n't show them to me . Pick out the one that says what you think , what you feel ,  |p197and  send it off by special delivery mail . The few pennies extra wo n't break you . " " Are you inferring that I 'm stingy ? " " The word is implying , as you should know from your St. Bartholomew'sLatin . " " Implying , then . Are you implying that I 'm stingy ? " " I have n't seen you light your cigars with ten-dollar notes , not lately . " " I have n't seen you with a ten-dollar note since Chat died . " O'Byrne jumped to his feet , but even with that much warning George Lockwood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch to mouth and nose that blinded him . " Only a bastard would say a thing like that , " said O'Byrne . " Put up your fists . " " I can lick you , O'Byrne . But I should n't have said that . " " You 're only bigger . You ca n't fight better . I want to fight you for that . " " No . " George Lockwood , taller and at least as strong , pinioned O'Byrne 's arms to his sides and shoved him to his cot . Then he left the room , and there was blood from his nose on his handkerchief . An hour later he heard O'Byrne 's voice through the open window . " Lockwood ? I want to talk to you . " " Go on down and talk to him . We 're trying to study , " said Lewis , one of the roommates . O'Byrne was standing in the light from the entryway lamp . " I brought you your telegram . And my apologies . " " Nobody behaved very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter is that you hit a sore spot , and I did n't know it was there . " " Do you need money ? " " No . Let 's walk , and I 'll tell you . " They set out in the direction of Kingston , marching silently in step for the first few minutes . " I hit you because the truth hurts . I 'm not broke . But I was counting on my winnings to take me to Africa . I ought to know better than to count on winnings . " " There 's still Davenport . " " There 's Davenport and a rich sophomore that transferred from Ohio State . But I no longer want to play . There 's a game tonight I could come out winners , I 'm sure . There I go again , but I could . But I 've lost interest . Ever since Chat died I have n't wanted to play . I used to like to play with him . I took his money , he had plenty of it , and we always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you blame yourself because he did n't have enough money that time ? " " No . It is n't that . You had money in the bank and we were on our way to give it to him . " " True . " " No , I do n't blame myself that way . It 's just that the fun 's gone out of it . If I sit clown and see a deck of cards and a stack of chips , I 'm afraid it 'd be too much for me , I do n't think I 'll ever want to play cards again . Gambling  --  yes . That 's too much a part of me to give that up . But not cards . The irony is that cards are the only gambling I 'm good at . " " How much do you need to go to Africa ? " O'Byrnc shook his head . " No thanks , George . I 'll never go to Africa , either . That was part of it , do n't you see ? Chat . Poker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I can see how that would be . " " Did you ever stop to think of these things , George ? Chat went up to New Brunswick . Met a young woman that took his fancy . Gave her one too many cockloads , and now she 's bearing him a child that will grow up a bastard . The terrible thing that happened to Chat , the grieving his mother and father are left with , forever asking themselves why , why , why . And of considerably less importance , one Edmund O'Byrne , Class of 1895 Princeton University , is unable to conquer the diamond fields of Africa . Take a look at that bluish ball up there , hanging in the sky , and think of all we know about it .

As far as I know , God is supposed to be so big , so powerful that it 's no problem for Him to invent , I mean create , the moon and you and me . " " My friend , that 's another argument , but it does n't argue anything . That 's just a statement of faith . I 'd rather put one theory up against another instead of making one theory into a great universal truth . You 'll never get any fun out of your intellect if you do n't argue with yourself .

Princeton is only four years of my life , and Princeton means nothing to me but four years of my life . Princeton without the four years of my life does n't mean anything to me .

" " Maybe I ought to marry an Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I guess so . " Now they could laugh , and they did . Harvey Fcnstermacher  --  Harvey Stonebraker Fenstermacher , to give him his full name  --  prided himself on two things : he was a man of his word , and he was not a hypocrite . He also prided himself on being a good Christian , a good Mason , a good Sigma Chi , a member of an old Lebanon Valley family , an honest judge , a Godfearing member of the Reformed Church , a better than average shot , a prudent hanker , a knowing farmer , a fancier of fine Holstein stock , a good judge of trotters , a pleasing baritone , and a real family man . Now , however , he was disturbed by his deviations from excellence in the matter of keeping his word , in his sincerity , and in his role as family man . He did not feel right about the way things were turning out with regard to his daughter Lalie and George Lockwood . There were often times when he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way as her mother ; that she was a female woman . Bessie Fenstermacher was a female woman , all right , and not only did they have the children to prove it , but Bessie , in the long years of their marriage , had been quite surprising in her demands on his masculinity . That had not been the Bessie he married ; she was just like all the other girls of good family  --  at first  --  but she certainly had learned quickly . Harvey Fenstermacher supposed that that was the same thing that would happen to Lalie ; that she was a female woman and , once married , would probably behave the way her mother behaved . But Harvey Fcnstermacher did not like to think about that , and so he did n't very much . He preferred to think of Lalie as she looked at , say , fifteen , with her hair plaited and hanging down her back and wearing a girl 's version of a sailor suit , and not bothering about or bothered by boys . No , not fifteen . Twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already started mensing , had been mensing for over a year . Why did they have to grow up and all ? Well , they did , and it was nature . Harvey Fenstermacher put up no serious objections when Bessie favored an understanding between Lalie and George Lockwood . As far as he was concerned , an understanding could go on forever  --  though he knew better  --  or it could end in a few weeks . Understandingswere harmless if the parents exercised a little extra vigilance , and he could count on Bess to take care of that . But then after Christmas Harvey Fenstermacher was unexpectedly reminded of the other , permanent and final possibilities that an understanding could imply . In his professional life he could have managed postponements and given his law clerk some investigative work to do ; but now Bess was prevailing upon him to give his quick consent to an engagement . She wanted Lalie to marry this Lockwood boy , and she wanted no interference from Harvey Fenstermacher . " We do n't know so much about him , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I made inquiries , and you can bet your boots he 's as good as there is in Lebanon , or better . The father is worth up in the millions , the mother was one of those Hoffners from Richterville . You stay out of this , Harvey , and do n't ruin Lalie 's chances . " " I do n't have anything against the boy , but what 's the hurry yet ? " " The hurry is there is no hurry , " said Bess . " The hurry was last summer when I made them have an understanding . Now the understandingtime is over and the engagement time starts . You do n't go out in the yard and shake a George Lockwood out of the pear tree . You should hear David on how lucky Lalie is . David considers himselfhonored if George Lockwood gives him the time of day , that 's what David thinks of him . " " Is he that friendly with David ? Maybe he 'd do something for the boy . " This is n't your politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Lalie engaged and married . " If that was how Bess felt about it , Harvey Fenstermacher was not going to oppose her . She was pretty sharp in some things , and if Lalie was ready to get married , let her mother take the full responsibility . In a way he had said goodbye to Lalie when she was fifteen . Or twelve . He did not really know this female woman who said she was in love with this Lockwood boy . Let her marry and go away , and then bring him some grandchildren . It would be nice to have some grandchildren . Cute little buggers they 'd be . So it rested until the day of George Lockwood 's formal request forp202Lalie 's hand . Harvey Fenstermacher tried to be agreeable , tried his best , but Lockwood rubbed him the wrong way . The fellow did not talk like a Pennsylvanian , he dressed too old for a college senior , he had artificial manners . He was like one of those out-of-town lawyers that came into Harvey Fenstermacher 's court for Iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they lost they always appealed . They treated his court like a way-station on the Fort Penn , Richterville &; Lantenengo . Lawyer in his court or suitor in his home , George Lockwood rubbed Harvey Fenstermacher the wrong way , and the quarrel which happened to be over son David and the club situation at Princeton was inevitable ; they might just as easily have quarreled over something else , and honestly admitting this to himself , Harvey Fenstermacher was troubled . He had pretended all was well , but he felt hypocritical , miserable . If it was possible to justify what he was about to do , he would justify it , but justified or not , he was determined to keep Lockwood from marrying Lalie . Within two weeks from the time of the Sunday quarrel Harvey Fenstermacher had all the justification he needed , and there was sweet triumph over Bess to make the justification more than complete . Ironically , she had furnished him with one of his leads ; conveniently , right in Lebanon . On the way home from the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor-candy store , occasionallystopping to pick up a brick of ice cream or a box of candy . Vic was a prosperous merchant , a good Mason , a Godfearing member of the Reformed Church , although not ever a visitor to the Fenstermacherresidence . " Afternoon , Vic . " " Afternoon , Judge . Half a pound of jordan almonds , pound of chocolate nougats . A day early this week . Must of had company Sunday , say ? " " Uh-huh . Company . If you got a half a minute , Vic ? " said Harvey Fenstermacher . It was not unusual for the two men to speak in privateon lodge and church matters . They seated themselves on bentwirechairs in the rear of the establishment . " All right , we 're private , " said Hoffner . " You 're related to a family named Lockwood over in Lantenengo County , " said Fenstermacher . " Distantly . Only distantly . I know the family you mean . That 's the young fellow come in here with Lalie . Well , his mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins . She was , uh , uh , Adelaide Hoffner and married this Abraham Lockwood . I was to thep203wedding . They 's married back , oh , I do n't know , twenty-five-so year ago . " " Tell me all you can . " " Well , you mean about the Lockwood side ? Swedish Haven is their town . Very well-to-do . I heard he was a millionaire , Abraham Lockwood , and I would n't doubt it . You want everything , Harvey ? " " All you can tell me . " " Well , Levi Hoffner , my cousin , he had these six daughters and he was well-off , too . But I do n't remember him being too pleased with Adelaide marrying Lockwood , rich or no rich . Now I have to think a minute . . . Ah , yes . Abraham Lockwood had a father , and where he come from I 'm not reliable . I did know , but I forgot . Anyhow , the father of Abraham Lockwood murdered a fellow in broad daylight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot him dead and he stood trial for it . They must have the records of it in Gibbsville . Is n't Gibbsville the county seat over in Lantenengo ? " " Yes , and it does n't surprise me , anything that happens over there . " " Me either . Some of those mining villages , they have a murder every payday . Irish Mollie Maguires , they call them . " " Oh , sure . I remember them very well . " " Well , Lockwood got off free , but then he killed another fellow . No ! No , it was the other way around . He killed one fellow first , and they could n't prove it . I think that was what Levi said . Then the second time he killed a fellow , they hauled him into court . But he went free . " " This was the father of Abraham Lockwood ? The grandfather of the young fellow that 's been in here with Lalie ? " " You have right . But there 's more yet . This they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me think a little . . . Ah , yes . Lockwood , Abraham , was all right in the head , but his mother not and his sisters not . The sisters they had to put away . Oh , yes ! Now I remember ! The one sister was in the crazy-house and the other they did n't put her in till the wedding was over . " " And the mother ? " " You 'll have to ask , Harvey . Here my memory is not so good on . But she was wheely . You know , going around in her head the wheels . Slang . " Harvey Fenstermacher nodded . " Does your wife know all this ? " " No . I was n't a married man then and I never said nothing to her about any Lockwood . " " Well , she got this far without hearing it ... "  | " I 'm not a talker , Harvey . Do n't you worry . " To obtain court records from Lantenengo County would take some time , and Harvey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidential law clerk acquire so much information about a prospective son-in-law . And what was the use ? He did not want legal documentation ; what he had got from Vic Hoffner was enough for his purpose . He took the train to Reading and from there to Swedish Haven . Abraham Lockwood 's offices were in a small one-story brick buildingin the business district of Swedish Haven . There was a brass plate on the front door , and there were dark green curtains on rings that slid on a brass rail , shutting off pedestrians ' view of the interior . The legend on the brass plate was Lockwood &; Company , Est. 1835 . It was a suhstantial-looking place , and just inside the door there was a polished walnut fence as a reminder to visitors that they were not free to proceed unannounced . " I wish to see Mr. Abraham Lockwood , " said Harvey Fenstermacher . " Here is my card . " A middle-aged woman in a shirtwaist and skirt , wearing a fleur-deliswatch and oilcloth sleeve covers , said : " Judge Harvey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly take a seat , Judge ? " " I 'd rather stand , thank you . " The woman went back to a private office , and Harvey Fenstermachersaw a man at a roll-top desk take the card , look up , and look out toward the visitor . The man signaled to Harvey Fenstermacher to come back to his office . " Good morning , Judge Fenstermacher , " said Abraham Lockwood . He was a tall thin fellow and a bit of a dude ; the cut of his suit was not unusual , but it was light grey and had satin facing on the lapels , and he wore a gold question mark as a stickpin in his Ascot . He had a Greek-letter fraternity pin on his waistcoat . Lockwood kept a hand on the doorknob and waved Fenstermacher to a chair with the other hand . Accidentally or by design he was not offering to shake hands . " Good morning to you , sir , " said Fenstermacher . He waited for Lockwood to sit down , observing the manner in which Lockwood flicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar , Judge ? " " Not this early in the day , thank you . " " In town for the day ? Of course I 've heard about you from my son George . " " George is what I came to see you about . "  | " Well , that does n't surprise me , Judge . I guess matters have proceededpretty fast with our young people . Mrs. Lockwood had a letter from George day before yesterday . " " Saying ? " " Saying that he 'd proposed to your daughter and been accepted . " " Is that the first you heard of it ? " " The first I knew that it had gotten to that stage . The young people today seem to take things into their own hands more than we ever did . " " Some do , some do n't . " " Yes , I guess that 's true . George does . I always encouraged George to be self-reliant , and he is . That makes it easier for me , in a way . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and we have no arguments about it . I do n't often have to speak to him twice . " " I see . Then maybe that makes things easier all around . My daughter was taught to obey but we did n't do it the same way you did . We gave her her orders every day of her life . " " Well , that was your way , and we had ours , and both ways work , " said Lockwood . He suddenly leaned forward . " The question is , Judge , what is it that 's made easier all around ? " " Uh-huh . You 're a clever man , Mr. L ckwood . " " A busy member of the bar does n't jusl accidentally pay a call on a business man sixty miles away . Clever ? Well , I inherited some horse sense from my father . " " What else ? I do n't mean money . " " What else did I inherit ? Is that what you came to see me about ? " " Partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " You do n't like clever men , do you , Judge ? " " No , I do n't . " " Very well , since you 've already called me clever , I have nothing to lose , so I 'll be clever . You want to stop this marriage because you 've been digging into our family history . " He turned around and faced Fenstermacher . " All right . I 'll stop it . " " How ? " " That 's none of your damn business , Judge . Your business is to go back to your little pile of shit in Lebanon and crow like a rooster . " " Do n't you talk to me like that , you  --  " " What will you do ? Fine me for contempt of court ? Get out before I kick you out , you dumb Dutch bastard . And keep your distance or I 'll brain you with this poker . " Lockwood balanced the poker from his fireplace . " You got already two murders in your family , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " He shook his fist at Abraham Lockwood . " Set foot in Lebanon County once , Mister , " he said , and left . " You 'll never get the truth out of your old man , " said Ned O'Byrne . " Neither will Lalie out of her old man . But it stands to reason that Judge Fenstermacher went there with a chip on his shoulder . He 's the one that went to Swedish Haven , not your old man to Lebanon . " " My father 's pretty clever sometimes . He could outfox the judge , if he wanted to . But I wonder if he wanted to . " " Oh . You think your old man was against this marriage ? " said O'Byrne . " Why ? " " All , that 's where he 's clever , my father , " said George Lockwood . " He never lets anybody know what he 's thinking , or why he does anything . " O'l3yrne looked quickly at his friend ; it was the first time in their four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anyone in such tones of innocent admiration . It silenced O'Byrne 's ready irreverence . Agnes Wynne was not a member of the main , Thomas Wynne line , but as a second cousin and the only living female of her generation she partook of the benefits and protection that went with the name . tier father was always taken care of with some job in the Wynne Coal Company that did not require a technical knowledge of coal mining . He was paymaster at one colliery , purchasing agent at another , assistant superintendent in charge of outside  --  surface  --  work at two of the larger operations . Before he was thirty years old he realized that the name Wynne , that had got him his jobs , also kept him from enjoying the complete trust of the men he worked with . The company spy was to be found in all grades of coal mining personnel , and while the employes he dealt with were not actively hostile to this gentle , amiable man , they never could forget that he was a Wynne . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept him in daily contact with the men who worked with their hands , but conditions did not greatly change when he became assistant superintendent . A superintendent always had his eye on the colliery next above , and thep207superintendents of the largest collieries were ambitious for general managerships and vice-presidencies . Every superintendent 's secretary always knew more about a colliery than Assistant Superintendent Theron B. Wynne , the cousin of Old Tom . But there was no place else to go , and Theron Wynne knew it , and so he went fishing at the company dams and wherever he could find an unpolluted stream ; he painted his pictures of the breakers and the culm banks , and once or twice a year he would be off to Wilkes-Barre or Gibbsville for a threedaydrunk . One advantage of being a Wynne was that he could tell his boss beforehand that he was taking a few days off on private business , and since he was not indispensable , no questions were asked . On his return he would always have nice presents for his wife and for Agnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to this defeated man , with his frail body and his awkward efforts to make people fond of him . He could tell Bessie , and no one else , that in college he had wanted to become a missionary , but his older cousin was footing the bills for his education and expected him to go to work for the Wynne Coal Company . He had failed Cousin Tom while still in college , when a physician said he could never work inside a mine and should therefore abandon the thought of studying to be a civil engineer specializing in mining . The defeat of Theron Wynne was accomplished early in life , for he had also failed himself for the same reason , health , that prevented his fulfilling his secret ambition to bring Christianity and the Presbyterian doctrines to the black man in Africa . Sometimes , watching the men quitting the mine at the end of a shift , Theron Wynne sardonically observed that the faces and hands of the miners were blackened as dark as any he would have preached to in the jungles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his preaching would have been . as firm ; but Theron Wynne made no attempt to convert the Irish and Lithuanians and Poles . His own faith was shaky , as frail as his body . As the years passed and he did not die , he discovered that his constitution had acquired the habit of staying alive and become equal to the few demands he put upon it . He could walk many miles through the woods if he did not hurry , and his semi-annual debauches in Wilkes-Barre and Gibbsville seemed to exact no more than a temporary distress . Even his conscience ceased to trouble him two days after he got home and was once again in the routine of respectability . He loved Bessie and was gratefully fascinated by her love for him and for her having made him a fully functioning man . But his love for Bessie was not comparable to the love he breathed for his daughter . The mystery of Agnes Wynne had no beginning ; he accepted as fact the evidence that by making love to Bessie he had started a lifep208that grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , but from his first sight of this thing that was his child he understood that the changes in himself had already begun ; he did not know when . Nor care . In a little while his first sight of her was also lost in the past , as had been the love-making , as had been Bessie 's uncertainty and then conviction that she was carrying a child . The presence of his daughter in his life enabled him to admit that he had not wanted a son ; he had been ashamed to admit that even to himself while Bessie was carrying Agnes , but he could confess to himself after Agnes was born that he had been afraid his child would be a boy . When a boy grew up he would expect his father to be strong and forceful and talented in ways that Theron 13 . Wynne was not . That boy would have been embarrassed by his father . The possibility that a second child would be a male was less frightening to Theron Wynne ; Agnes would be there to stand between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 13ut the breeding capacities of Bessie and Theron Wynne were exhausted in Agnes , and she remained unique in her father 's experience . Bessie Wynne did all the hard things that were necessary to the raising of the child ; the disciplining , the punishments . But Bessie in her wisdom and contentment was satisfied to have Theron appear to he benevolent , provident , loving , as though in his place as father and husband he were above the hard things . He in turn conceded nearly all authority to Bessie . " It 's no use going to your father , " she would say to the child . " He 's as strict as I am . " The child was taught not to test her father 's strictness , and the myth became in a practical sense a reality : Agnes believed that her father was the true source of strength in the family , and his favors and amiability were made to seem like rewards . It was a quiet household , wherever they happened to be living , in whatever Company house they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hired girl ; once a week they had a woman in to do the washing , and Agnes was brought up to help with the household chores . Later there was always a hired girl as well as a Monday-and-Tuesday woman for the washing and ironing . Theron paid no rent in the Company houses , and nearly everything he needed for himself and his family could be bought wholesale through the Company stores  --  food , clothing , their Chickering upright piano , his fishing tackle , his art supplies . Coal for their stove and furnace was delivered free of charge , and Theron Wynne had the use of a horse and buggy or cutter as a privilege of his rank . The social standing of the family was doubly automatic ; they were Wynnes , and Theron Wynne 's jobs were always considered office jobs.  |p209Agnes  was sixteen before her second cousin Tom Wynne got what he called a real good look at her , and what he saw he liked . " Theron , you know who this girl looks like ? She looks like Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named her after , Cousin Tom . " " You look like your grandmother , girl . Pity you never saw her . You remember Theron 's mother , Bessie ? " " I sure do , Cousin Tom . But I do n't want you to spoil this one telling her she resembled Grandmother Wynne . Do n't want to turn her head . " " They wo n't turn this one 's head , will they , girl ? You look to me like a pretty sensible young lady . Where you got her in school , Bes-sie ? " " Here . Hilltop High School . " " Uh-huh . What are you taking , girl ? " " Which course ? The four-year . I 'm a junior . " " I 'm in favor of that . You intend to give her a year away at boarding school , Theron ? " " After she finishes High , we might . " " You did n't say what subjects you 're taking , girl . " " The regular four-year course . This year I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is . English . First-year French . High School Civics . And drawing . " " Keep you busy ? You passing everything ? " " Yes sir , " said the girl . " Tell Cousin Tom , " said Theron Wynne . " She has the highest marks of any girl in her class , and the best of anybody , boys or girls , in Latin and French . " " Conduct ? I guess I do n't have to ask that . " " Oh  --  all right , I guess , " said the girl . " Tell him , he wants to know , " said Theron Wynne . " She has the highest mark in Deportment , too . That 's Conduct . She never had anything but A , ' all through High . " " I knew it . You can tell by looking at her . Theron , I recommend you and Bessie do n't wait till she finishes Hilltop High . Send her to boarding school . Young lady , will you excuse yourself while your father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Excuse me , " said Agnes , leaving them . " Do you realize this is the only female Wynne of her age ? Her generation . I 'm going to do something for this girl . I like the cut of her jib . Good manners . Neat and clean . And I had no idea she was so smart . You pick out a good school , and I 'll foot the bills . " " Oh , Cousin Tom . . . " Bessie Wynne began to cry . " Hell , I put her father through Lafayette and he did n't disappointp210me the way some other relations have . You know who I 'm talking about . My own son , yet to do an honest day 's work . The money he cost me , I 'd like to see my money do some good for a change . You pick out a good school and we 'll sit down and figure out the cost and I 'll put that money in the Hilltop bank , in case some Union hooligan takes a shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Cousin Tom , " said Bessie Wynne . " They would n't , eh ? You must think the Mollies are a thing of the past . Maybe you do n't hear about them so much any more , but I never go anywhere without a pistol in my pocket , let me tell you . The Mollie Maguires had big families , do n't forget , and my brother Albert helped to hang some of them . . . Anyhow , you pick out a school for Agnes , and Theron , you write me a letter . " He brought his voice down to a whisper . " Do n't want her to get interested in boys . Hilltop High School . Boys . Wrong ideas . Calf-love . Marry some Schwakie . " " I know , " said Bessie Wynne . " Well , you decide , " said Cousin Tom . " And Theron , I 'll hear from you in a day of two . " " You bet , Cousin Tom , " said Theron Wynne . " And I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And has looks , into the bargain , " said Cousin Toni Wynne . " I have to be going . " Agnes was taken out of Hilltop High after junior year and enrolled at Miss Dawson 's in Overbrook , where , like herself , most of the boarders were girls who had had a year or two in a public high school . The day pupils were the daughters of nearby Overbrook , Chestnut Hill , and Germantown families , and many of them would be leaving Miss Dawson 's for New England and Southern boarding schools for the final two years . As a result there was a constant turnover in the student body that made life interesting for the girls but did not make for efficiency among the teachers . The good ones did not stay long . " This place is like the Broad Street Station , " said one teacher in parting . But to Agnes Wynne and her parents and to the citizens of Hilltop and the other coal towns Miss Dawson 's was a fashionable finishing school that put the finishing school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who were going to Wilson and Goucher and Hood and Bryn Mawr , the bluestockings , who went to college because they wanted to go into competition with men . Cousin Tom Wynne , for all his admiration of Agnes 's brains , did not volunteer to continue her education , although she graduated from Miss Dawson 's at the head of her class . She had made good , and it was time for her to come home and wait for a suitable husband . Cousin Tom Wynne sponsored her by giving a dance at his house , top211which were invited all the coal and lumber and beer and whiskey and legal and medical plutocracy of the area . George Lockwood was not invited to the dance . Swedish Haven , although it was only a few miles from Gibbsville , was not considered to belong to the coal region . It was the last Pennsylvania Dutch town on the way northward , and Gibbsville was the first coal town . It made no difference that George Lockwood was only half Pennsylvania Dutch ; he belonged to Swedish Haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Dutch spoken more than English ; in Gibbsville even the families of German ancestry were letting the patois die , while they adapted themselves to the New England Yankee influence that had always prevailed . George Lockwood , of Swedish Haven , got to the Thomas Wynne dance because he was a Princeton man who was in the Wynneville neighborhood for a Princeton wedding . It was the year after the breaking of his engagement to Lalie Fenstermacher . He was living at home , getting started on the task of taking over his father 's business interests . Abraham Lockwood systematically acquainted George with the real estate holdings in the town and the farm properties in the rural area ; the bank , the distillery , the coal-dredging operations in the river  --  and the portfolio of shares in distant enterprises . Instead of a liberal allowance Abraham Lockwood put his son on the Lockwood payroll and gave him a desk in the Lockwood &; Company office . Father and son walked to work together every day and had noon dinner together at their table in the Exchange Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor properties to his son , and in a year 's time George Lockwood was already a well-to-do man in his own right . He was also , without realizing it , becoming more and more involved in the affairs of Lockwood &; Company and in the advancementof the Lockwood Concern . He was a beloved son , in whom his father was well pleased . His mother could not stand the sight of him ; he was replicating the original Abraham Lockwood with an eager innocence that she found as distasteful as though he had set out to taunt her . Adelaide Lockwood was sickened and then sick as she watched her son adopt his father 's mannerisms and try to overtake him , sometimes successfully , in cleverness . Abraham Lockwood was delighted and proud when George produced schemes to save money or make it ; he would overlook the unsuccessful ones and over-praise the effectual . And always the father consciously and the mother vaguely were observing the son 's seduction by the Concern . This thing , whatever it was , that Abraham was trying to engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on George , and she wasp212only half-hearted in her attempts to hold on to Penrose . The younger son , now a freshman at Princeton , would succumb to George 's influenceas George had succumbed to his father 's , and Adelaide Lockwoodcaught one cold after another until a particularly heavy congestiondeveloped into pleurisy and death . She could look back and find only one triumph over the Lockwoods : she had made her father-inlawtake down that wall . Not a man or woman in Swedish Haven knew that it was not pus in the chest that had caused her death . There was no diagnosis of hatred or chagrin or frustration , and of the three tall men who stood at Adelaide 's graveside the younger two seemed grieved and baffled . The oldest man seemed only grieved , but then he was older and the aging learn to accept the inevitable . A nice stained glass window eventually was installed in the Lutheran Church in Adelaide 's memory . Pastor Bollinger was secretly grateful that Abraham Lockwood wanted no special ceremony dedicating the window ; Bollinger had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what could you say about a woman who would never be missed ? The widower and the bereaved son made a handsome pair on their marches between home and office , and with the departure of Adelaide Lockwood from the local scene , the all-male Lockwood establishmentcreated less resentment than hitherto had been the case . Abrahamand his son George kept pretty much to themselves , as the Lockwoods had always done , but the citizens were beginning to look upon Abraham and George Lockwood as something more than individuals ; they represented , or George represented , the family 's third generation in the town ; three generations of money , two generations of money with style , higher education , military service , imposing connectionsin Gibbsville and Philadelphia , and a continuity of residence in the town and of increasing earning power . The two men walking together , father and son , were now being spoken of in not altogether unfavorable tones as " our aristocracy . " Bigger towns had their aristocracy , and now Swedish Haven discovered it had one of its own . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now permissible and even admirable in the all-male Lockwood family . The Concern had been expedited by the departure of the female member of the family , and now Abraham Lockwood was ready to proceed to the next phase . The Fenstermacher fiasco , he decided , was a lucky accident . A union with the Lebanon County Fenstermachers , headed by a judge , had at first glance offered some advantages ; but from his own experienceAbraham Lockwood became convinced that the Concern wouldp213be better served if George could find a suitable wife who was not Pennsylvania Dutch . The Pennsylvania Dutch knew how to hold on to their money and to make more , and they were extremely respectablewhen they got rich ; but they were stodgy . They were middleclassGermans and with few exceptions they so remained , generation after generation . Adelaide and her family had pre-Revolutionary roots , and had been rich for more than a century ; but no one even in jesting tones had ever called them aristocratic . They had shown no disposition to capitalize on their long American history or their generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the look of an aristocrat was her son George , and it had taken Lockwood blood to achieve that . If George went to the Pennsylvania Dutch for a wife , his children might turn out to be Hoffners , and the Lockwood Concern would be dissolved in a single generation . Abraham Lockwoodwas determined that next time he would be more vigilant from the beginning when George took an interest in a young woman . Meanwhile he would consolidate his position in the boy 's esteem , which he would do by companionability , sensible generosity , and tokens of respect for his son 's judgment , and at the same time exercisingearly caution in the control of George 's relations with young women . The boy was concupiscent and susceptible , his father knew , and obviously attractive . He had to be watched . Fortunately he had gone through college without becoming a boozer . Abraham Lockwood was careful not to turn into a bore . At the office he kept the boy busy and on many days they would have no conversation from eight-thirty until noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . " How would you like to go to the crew races next week ? " " Next week ? I 'm sorry , Father , but that 's the week I 'm going to that wedding , " said George . " What wedding is that ? Who 's getting married ? " " A fellow in my club , a fellow named Lassiter , is marrying a girl whose name I forget . They both live near Hazleton . " " Franklin M. Lassiter 's son ? " " Yes . Coal-mining . " " Oh , I know that . The Lassiters . The Wynnes . Well , you ought to have a good time up there . Those coal millionaires know how to spend their money . " " Yes , I 'm catching a train here , stopping just for me . A special train that starts in Philadelphia , picks up fellows along the way . Sleeping cars , a diner , and a chair car . We use the train as a hotel while we 're up there . "  | " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'm sorry you 'll miss the crew races but you 'll have a better time where you 're going .

We were in a city , do n't forget . " " Yes , I 'll bet you were a gay blade . " " On that subject , silence is golden , my boy . I prefer you to have some illusions about your father . " " All right , if you have yours about me . " " None . Absolutely none . But have your good time now . " At the last minute Thomas Wynne extended a blanket invitation to the young gentlemen in town for the Lassiter-Powell wedding , and they were conveyed to the Wynne estate in mule-drawn buses . The Wynne gardens were lit by Japanese lanterns and a special pavilion had been erected for the dancing . The pavilion , in approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slope just below the Wynne mansion and thus offered a view of the Company-owned Lake Wynne and of Lawyer  --  originally Loire  --  Valley . The location was remarkable , and visitors always exclaimed at its beauty . " You know why it 's so pretty , " Tom Wynne would reply . " All around here , to the east and the west and the south , are coal mines . No matter how you conic here , by train or by team , you have to go through the mining patches . Then you get up here and you do n't see a single breaker , no culm banks anywhere . That takes you by surprise , and that 's the way I want it to be . Some day after I 'm dead and gone they 'll sink a shaft there where you see that little village , they 'll start cutting timber . But as long as I have any say it stays this way . " In the twilight before Agnes Wynne 's dance George Lockwood listened to the old man 's set speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said George Lockwood . Thomas Wynne turned to him . " Yes , if you want to reckon it in dollars and cents it is , young man . You 're Mr. Phillips ? " " No sir , this is Mr. Phillips . My name is Lockwood .

Are you in business , or you still studying ? " " I 'm in business with my father . " " Would that be Abraham Lockwood ? Over in Swedish Haven ? " " Yes sir . " " I know the name , " said Tom Wynne . " Well , gentlemen , I **26;6415;TOOLONG ( " Children nowadays prefer to buy Nutty Buddies , " Miss Faye said ) , they still went on baking , eating the cookies themselves , growing fat together and comparingnotes on their identical heart conditions .

" And Mr. Pike was saying , " Well , I know , I know , " and nodding gently without seeming to be listening . There was chicken salad on his chin , which meant that both the Potters kept staring tactfully down at their gloves instead of looking at him . Joan passed him a paper napkin , but he ignored it ; he sat forward on his chair and said , " It surely was nice of you to come . Nice to bring us supper . " " It 's the least we could do , " said Miss Lucy . She looked around her , toward the kitchen door , and then lowered her voice . " Tell me , " she whispered . " How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just breaks my heart , " said Mr. Pike . " Oh , my . " " Not a thing I can do , seems like . She just sits .

" " Never gave her a fair share . "  | " If it 's not one reason it 's another , " Miss Lucy said . " I 've seen that happen plenty of times . " " Maybe if you talked to her , " said Mr. Pike . He pushed his plate away and straightened up . " You think you could just run up there a minute ? " " Well , not run , no , but  --  " " I did n't mean that , " he said . " No , you can take the stairs as slow as you want to . But if you two would talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind  --  " " Why , we do n't mind a bit , " said Miss Faye . " We 'd be proud . " She reached up to set her flowered hat straighter , as if she might like to put an extra hat on top of the first one for such a special visit . And Miss Lucy pulled gloves to perfect smoothness , and then folded her hands tightly over her purse . " I just do n't like to trouble you , " Mr. Pike said . " You stop that , Roy Pike . " They rose simultaneously , with their backs very straight . But even making the trip across the kitchen they walked slowly , preparing themselves for the stairs . " Be careful , " Joan told them . " Just see they do n't get out of breath , Uncle Roy . " " I will . " But Simon was frowning as he watched them leave . " I ley , Joan , " he said . " Hmmm ? " " When they go up to bed at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps and then rest and talk ; they bring their knitting along . " " Well , that 's kind of silly , " said Joan . " Could they crumple up and die on our stairs ? "  | " No , they could not , " she said . " It would take more than that . " " How do you know ? " " I heard Dr. Kitt tell them so . They just should n't get too out of breath , is all , or run in any marathons . He said  --  " " I got an idea , " Simon said . " What ? " " Listen . " He stood up from his place at the table and came around to face her , with his hands hitched through his belt loops . " How about us going to a movie , " he said . " That Tarzan movie . " " We 're not supposed to . " " Well , I got to get out , " he said . She looked down at him , considering . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour still clung to it like some sort of sad clown makeup and his hair stuck up in wiry tangles . " Well , I do have to get Aunt Lou 's prescription , " she said . " Would you comb your hair first ? " " Sure . " " All right , we 'll go . " " Right now ? " " If you want to . " He nodded , but with his face still wearing that strained look , and turned to go upstairs and then turned back again . " I 'll wash downstairs , " he said . " There 's no soap here . " " I do n't care . " He turned on the water in the kitchen sink and splashed his face , and then he reached spluttering for the dishtowel . " My allowance money 's all the way upstairs , " he said . " I 'll pay you back tomorrow , if you 'll lend me the money . " " All right . " She went into the living room , with Simon following , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was combing his hair she went upstairs for her shoes . Mrs. Pike 's door was open now . She was lying on her bed , with her head propped up on two pillows and the sisters beside her talking steadily , and when Joan walked past , her aunt followed her with her soft blue eyes but only vaguely , as if she were n't seeing her , so Joan did n't stop in to say anything . She put on her shoes and picked up a scarf and went downstairs , where Simon was waitingwith his hand on the newel post and his face strained upward . " What 're they doing ? " he asked her . " I do n't know . " " Are they crying ? " " I do n't think so . " " Well . I would 've gone upstairs , " he said . " You know . " " I know . " " Did you think I would n't ? " " No . " She sighed suddenly , looking back toward the stairs . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well . " They went out the front door , across the porch , and down the wooden steps . It was beginning to get cool outside . Joan could hear tree frogs piping far away , and the wind had died down enough so that the sound of cars on the east highway reached her ears . She clasped herp54hands behind her back and followed Simon , cutting across the road and through the field toward town . " Remember I 've got heels on , " she called . " I remember . " " Remember that makes it hard walking . " He slowed down and waited for her , walking backwards . Behind him and all around him the field stretched wide and golden , with bits of tall yellow flowers stirring and glimmering like spangles in the sunlight . And when Joan came up even with him , so that he turned and walked forward again by her side , she could look down and see how his hair , bleached lighter on top , took on a varnished look out here and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned shiny and golden like the field he was walking in . " Right about here . . . " he said , but the wind started up just then and blew his words away . " What ? " she asked . " Right about here is where I lost that ball . Will you keep a lookout for it ? " " I will . " " Do you reckon I 'll ever find it ? " " No . " " I do n't either , " Simon said . But they walked slowly anyway , keeping their eyes on the ground , kicking at clumps of wild wheat to see what might turn up.  | " Hold STILL , " JAMES SAID . He bent over and peered through the camera . No one was holding still . Line upon line of Hammonds , from every corner of the state , littered the Larksville Hammonds ' front lawn , sitting , kneeling , and standing , lettingarms and legs and bits of dresses trail outside the frame of his camera . Whole babies were being omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the grown-ups stood there with their dusty blue , look-alike eyes smiling happily , certain that they and their children were being saved intact for future generations . James straightened up and shook his head . " Nope , " he said . " You 've moved every which-away again . Close in tighter , now . " He waited patiently , with his hands on his hips . For five years he had been going through this . Every year there was a picture of the Hammond family reunion to be put in the Larksville paper , and another two or three56for the Hammonds themselves to choose for their albums . By now he was resigned to it ; he had even started enjoying himself . He smiled , watching all those hordes of Hammonds close in obligingly with sideways steps while their eyes stayed fixed on the camera . Moving like that made them look like chains of paper dolls , bright and shimmering in the heat . Eyelet dresses and seersucker suits blurred together ; their whiteness was blinding . James shaded his eyes with one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent down over his camera again . But someone else was moving . It was Great-Aunt Hattie in the front row ; she had started coughing . She was sitting in a cane-bottom chair , with children and animals tangledat her feet and the grown-ups forming a protective wall behind her . When she began her coughing fit , they closed in still tighter in a semicircle and the oldest nephew leaned down with his head next to hers . The coughs grew farther apart . After a minute the nephew raised his head and said , " She 's sorry , she says . " The others murmured behind him , saying it did n't matter . Swallowed down the wrong throat , " said the nephew . Someone called out , " Give her brown bread . " And someone else said , " No , rock candy will do it . " But the aunt spread her old hands out in front of her , palms down and fingers stretched apart , signifying she was betternow and wanted to hear no more about it . " Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty or thirty Hammondsclosest to him drifted back to their original positionsand made their faces stern again . Mothers looked anxiously down the rows , gripping their neighbors ' arms and peering around them to make sure their childrenp57were at their best , and fathers hooked their thumbs into their belts and glared into the lens . " Hold it , " James said . When he snapped the picture there was a little stirringthrough the group , and everyone relaxed . " That 's the second , " he called to the hostess . " You want an-other ? " " One more , James . " While he was fiddling with the camera people began talking again , still standing in their set places , and some lit cigarettes . He peered through the view-finder at them . If this were any other picture he would snap it now , catching them at their ease , but family pictures were different . He liked the way they stood so straight in jumbled , self-conscious rows , and molded themselves to make a block of tensed-up faces . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it again  --  closed their mouths and narrowed their eyes and set their shoulders . He snapped the picture that way . Then he said , " That 's all , " and watched the children as they shook themselves and scatteredoff to play . The hostess walked up to him , trailing white lace , sinking into the ground at every step in her high-heeled pumps . " There 's one more I want , James , " she said , and then stopped and let her eyes wander after her youngest child . " Joey , you know not to ride that dog , " she called . " Yes , ma'am . " " I want you to photograph Great-Aunt Hattie alone , " she told James . " She 's getting old . Can you do that ? " " If she 's willing , " said James . " She 's not . "  | " Then maybe we should  --  " " Now , do n't you worry , " said Mrs. Hammond . " I 'll talk her around . They 're serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you some , and when you 're through I 'll have Aunt Hattie ready . Hear ? " " Well , okay , " James said . But Mrs. Hammond had n't stayed to hear his answer . He folded his equipment up and put it on the porch , out of the way of the children . Then he went across the yard to the driveway , where the others were standing in line for ice cream . They looked different now , quickmovingand flexible , with the paper-doll stiffness gone . In a way James was sorry . Some of the best pictures he had were these poker-straight rows of families , Hammondsand Ballews and Burnetts ; he kept copies of them filed away in his darkroom , and sometimes on long lonesomedays he pulled them out and looked at them a while , with a sort of faraway sadness coming up in him if he looked too long . He might have seen any one of those families only that morning in the hardware store , but when he looked at their faces in pictures they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once you 'd take a giggly picture , " Ansel said . " You make me so sorrowful . " ) Thinking about that made James smile , and the girl in front of him turned around and looked up at him . " I 'm thinking , " he told her . " That 's what it looked like , " she said . Her name was Maisie Hammond , and she lived across town from here and sometimes came visiting Ansel . She thought Ansel was wonderful . James was just considering this when shep59said , " How 's that brother of yours ? " and he smiled at her . " Just fine , " he said . " He 's home reading magazines . " " Well , say hello to him . " She moved up a space in line , still facing in James 's direction and walking backwards . Standing out in the sunlight like this she was pretty , with her towhead shining and her white skin nearly transparent , but Ansel had always said she was homely and only out to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from an old family ) . Whenever she came visiting , Ansel turned his face to the wall and played sicker than he was . That was how he planned to scare her off , but Maisie only stayed longer then and fussed around his couch . She liked taking care of people . She would fetch pillows and ice-water , and Ansel would wave them away . When she was gone , James would say , " Ansel , what you want to treat her like that for ? " But by that time Ansel had fooled even himself , and only tossed his head on the pillow and worried about how faint he felt . To make it up to Maisie now ( although she was n't aware there was anything to be made up ) , James stepped closer to her in the line and said , " Maisie , it 's been a good two weeks since you 've been by . " " Two days , " said Maisie . " Day before yesterday I was there . " " I never heard about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some arrangements for the Pikes . " The man ahead of her left with his Dixie cup of icep60cream , and Maisie turned forward again and took two cups from the stack on the table . " Here , " she said . She passed him a fudge ripple , with a little paper spoon lying across the top of it . " The children got to the strawberry before us . " " That 's all right , " said James . " I do n't like straw-berry . " He followed her back across the lawn , preferring to stick with her rather than interrupt the little individual reunions that were going on among the others . When she settled on the porch steps , fluffing her skirt out around her , he said , " You mind if I sit with you ? " She shook her head , intent on opening her ice cream . " I 'm going to take a picture of your great-aunt , " he said . " Oh , her . " " Do you like sitting out in the sun like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she looked hot ; she was too thin and bird-boned , and being the slightest bit uncomfortablemade her seem about to topple over . James was used to Joan , who was unbreakable and built of solid flesh . When he had pried the lid off his own ice cream , and dipped into it with his paper spoon , he said , " It 's sort of melty-looking . " Maisie did n't answer . She was staring off across the yard . " Better eat yours before it turns to milk , " he told her . But Maisie said , " Ansel was laying down , when I went to see him . " " He does that , " said James . " I mean laying still . Not doing anything . " " Well , it was nice of you to come , " he said.  |p61She  shrugged impatiently , as if he had n't understood her . " You were out doing something , " she told him . She seemed to be starting all over again now , telling the story a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was helping Mr. Pike with some arrangements , " said James . " That 's what Ansel said . " " I 'm sorry I was n't around . " " Well . When I came in I said , Hey , Ansel , ' and Ansel did n't even hear me . He was just laying there . I said , Hey ! ' and he jumped a foot , near about . He was a millionmiles away . " James was making soup out of his ice cream . He had it down to a sort of pulpy mess now , the way he liked it , and then he looked up and saw Maisie wrinkling her nose at it . He stopped stirring and took his first bite . " Ansel 's a great one for daydreaming , " he said with his mouth full . " He was n't daydreaming . " " Oh . " " He was crying , near about . " " Ansel ? " " Well , almost , " said Maisie . She sat forward , with the ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansel , what 's the matter ? ' But he never did say . His eyes were all blurry . " " You got to remember Janie Rose , " James said . " It was only three days ago . " " Well , I thought of that . But then I thought , no , Janie was n't all that much to him . She was right bothersome , as a matter of fact . We had her over for supper just ap62month ago , her and her family ; we gave them chicken . Marna forgot about Janie being vegetarian . Janie said , This chicken 's dead , ' and her daddy said , Well , I hope so , ' and everybody laughed , but Mama 's feelings were a little hurt . Though she went to the funeral and all , just like anyone else . I said , Ansel , is that what 's bothering you ? Janie Rose Pike being taken ? ' But the way he was acting , I do n't think that was the real reason . " " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is serious , James . " " I 'm being serious . " " Anyway , " Maisie sighed , and she took the first mouthful of her ice cream . It bothered him , the way she ate it ; she chewed , slowly and carefully , even though the ice cream was nothing but liquid now . When she had swallowed , she said , " All he would talk about was dying . He said he could see how it would all turn out ; they would mourn him like they mourn Janie Rose , not sad he died but sorry they had n't liked him more . He 'd rather they be sad he died , he said . " " Oh , now , " said James . " He 's been on that for days . It 'll pass . " " Will you listen ? I ca n't hardly sleep nights , for thinkingabout it . I keep wondering if he 's all right . " " Of course he 's all right , " James said . But Maisie was still hunching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . A child ran by , chased by another child , grabbing Maisie 's knee for supportas he pivoted past her , and Maisie only brushed his hand away absentmindedly . " Those times he goes away , " she said finally , " those times he starts to get bet/ter and then goes off drinking for a night and ca n't be found till morning . He 'll die of it . " " He wo n't die , " said James . " He could lead a life like any other man , if he was n't so scared of needles . " " He might die , " Maisie said . " What if one of those nights of his , he do n't come back ? " But James was getting tired of this . " Look , " he said firmly . He swallowed the last of his ice cream and said , " Ansel only goes so far , you notice . Only enough to worry people . You ever thought of that ? " " What ? Well , if that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll go ? " " I just do , " James said . " I been through this . " " Can you say for sure how far he 'll go ? " " I been through it hundreds of times . " " I believe you do n't even give it a thought , " said Maisie . " That 's what Ansel said . He said , What does James care  --  ' " " Well , we 've got to be clearheaded about this , " James said . " You 're clearheaded , all right . " She jabbed her spoon into her ice cream and left it there , standing straight up in the middle of the cup . " What does James care , ' he said , and then just lay there with his eyes all blurry  --  " " I do everything I can think of , " said James . " Oh , foot . " " I try everything I know . " " Then tell me this , if you do so much all-fired good . Can you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you thought about Ansel 's going off and letting you be someday ? "  | " Well , for  --  " " Never thought how nice it would be to live on your own for a change , just one little old TV dinner to pop into the  --  " " I try everything I know ! " James shouted , and then noticed how loud his voice was and lowered it . " I mean  --  " But Maisie just folded in the rim of her Dixie cup with all her concentration , as if her mind was made up . Then she rose and said , " Well , I 'll be seeing you . " Her skirt was rumpled in back , but she did n't bother smoothing it down . When she walked away James stood up , from force of habit , and waited until she was halfway across the yard before he sat down again . Inside he felt slow and heavy ; he was chewing on his lower lip , the way he did when he did n't know what to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned his empty ice cream cup around and around in his hands . In front of him some children were playing statues . An out-of-town boy was flinging the others by one arm and then crying , " Hold ! " so that they had to freeze there , and when he came to Janice Hammond , who was the littlest , he swung her around so hard that she spun halfwayacross the lawn and landed against Mrs. Hammond , who was heading over toward James . " Hold ! " the boy said . Mrs. Hammond looked down at Janice , who was clutching her around the middle . She said , " Oh , Janice , " tiredly , and was about to pull away , but the other childrenstopped her . " No , Janice has got to stay that way , " said the out-of-town boy , and Mrs. Hammond seemed too tired to argue . She stood still , rising above Janice'sp65circled arms like the figure of someone passively drowning , and called out , " James , we 're ready with Aunt Hat-tie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Over there . Standing up . We wanted her to sit but she says no , she 'll do it standing . Die with her boots on . She does n't like cameras . " She came to life suddenly and disentangled herself from Janice , ignoring the other children'sprotests . " She 's fading , " she said . James looked over at Janice , surprised , and Mrs. Hammond caught his look and shook her head . " Aunt Hattie , I mean , " she said . " Just fading away . " " I 'm sorry to hear that , " said James . He gathered up his equipment and came after her . " She looked all right to me . " " Well , she fades out and then in again . " They circled a little group of women , all standing in identical positions with folded arms while they watched the children playing statues . " I do n't like doing this if she do n't want me to , " James called . " Some people just have an allergy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulder and kept walking . Out here on the grass the sun was still hot , and the back of Mrs. Hammond 's powdered neck glistened faintly . She had the same brittle little bones as her niece Maisie , only covered now with a solid layer of flesh . James looked away from her and shifted his equipment to the other shoulder . " Right here would be a good place , " he said . He had n't really looked around ; he just wanted to stop and not do anything any more . The heaviness inside was weighing him down . Hep66set the camera on its tripod and then leaned on it , with his chin propped on his hand , and Mrs. Hammond said , " You all right ? " " I 'm fine , " James said . " You look kind of tired . " He straightened up and tucked his shirt in . There was Great-Aunt Hattie , only a few yards away now , being led gingerly by Mrs. Hammond . Aunt Hattie looked neither to the right nor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't there . The closer they got to the camera , the farther away her eyes grew . " Right here would be a good place , " said Mrs. Hammond . " Do n't you think so , James ? In front of the roses ? " " Fine , " James said . He had started adjusting his cameraand was n't really looking now . But when he raised his eyes again he saw that the old woman had been placed directly in front of a circular flower bed ; she seemed to be rising from the middle of it , like an intricatelysculptured garden decoration . James smiled . " I 've changed my mind , " he said . " I do n't think she should have those flowers behind her . " " They 're so pretty , though , " Mrs. Hammond said sadly . " Well . But I think she should have just grass behind her . You mind moving over , Miss Hattie ? " " I have just one thing to say , " Miss Hattie said suddenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell me where to go , but do n't push me around . " " Oh , I wo n't , " said James.  | " The last time I had my picture taken  --  " " I think he wants you to move over , " Mrs. Hammond said . " Could you step this way , dear ? " The aunt stepped stiffly , jerking her chin up . " I was saying , Connie , " she said , " the last man that took my picture was in need of an anatomy lesson . I told him so . He came right up to me and pushed my face sideways but my shoulders full-front , and my knees sideways but my feet full-front , so I swear , I felt like something on an Egyptian wall . You should have seen the photograph . Well , I do n't have to tell you how it looked . I said  --  " " If I were you I 'd let my beads show , " said Mrs. Hammond . " They 're such nice ones . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " snapped Aunt Hattie . She raised her hands , heavy with old rings , and fumbled at the neck of her crepe dress until she had closed it high around her throat , hiding the beads from sight . " Now no one can see them , " she said , and Connie Hammond sighed and turned to James with her hands spread hopelessly . " I try and I try , " she told him , and he looked up from fiddling with his camera and smiled . " Why do n't you go on and see to the others , " he said , " and I 'll call you when I 'm through . I bet you have n't even had your ice cream yet . " " No . No , I 've been so busy . Well , I might for just a minute , maybe  --  " She trailed off across the yard , lookingrelieved , and the last part of her to fade away was her voice , which still flowed on and on . " She 's putting on weight , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera ready now , but he was waiting because he wanted the picture to be just right . He bent down and cleared away a dandelion from one of the tripod legs , and then over his shoulder he called , " You comfortable like that ? Do n't want to sit down ? " " No . I 'll stand . " Connie Hammond would n't like that , but James was glad . To him Aunt Hattie looked just right this way  --  standing against a background of bare grass , holding her shoulders high to hide the beads and jutting her chin out at him . She had terrified high school students for forty years that way , back when she taught Latin I. Peoplestill told tales about her . She had declined her nouns in a deafening roar and slammed her yardstick against her desk on the ending of every verb . While students could lead other teachers off their subjects just by asking how they 'd met their husbands , Miss Hattie had only strayed from Latin once a year , at Christmastime , when she read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could picture that . He wished he had her in a classroom right now , to photograph her the way she stood in his mind . But all he had was this wide lawn , and he would have to make do with that . He stood there , pressing a dandelion between his fingers and squinting across at her . " That 's right , " he told her . " That 's what I want . " She shifted her feet a little . " How many prints you plan to make of this ? " she asked . " Ma'am ? " " How many copies . " " Oh . As many as you want . "  | " Well , I want none , " she said . " I 'd like to request that you make the one picture asked of you and have that be that . " " Oh , now . " " Connie can have one , if she wants it so much . But that 's because I do n't like her . Nothing she could do would make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't have one . " " Danny who ? " he asked . " Raise your chin a little , please . " " Danny Hammond . Is there anyone in this world whose last name is n't Hammond ? " She raised her chin but went on talking ; James leaned his elbow on his camera and waited . " Danny I put up with , " she said . " How long will they hide him away from me ? " " Danny Hammond ? Why , I saw him only last  --  " " You saw him . You saw him . But do you think I do ? They rush him away the moment I come around ; he looks back over his shoulder all bewildered . He 's only seven . " " Could you turn more toward me ? " asked James . " They think he insulted me last Valentine 's Day . " " Oh , I do n't think Danny would  --  " " Made me a present . None of these easy-breaking things from the gift shop . Made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact shape of my head , with even the wrinkles painted in . " " That 's nice , " said James . " Do you know where the salt came out ? " " Well , no . " " My nose . Ho , out my nose . Two little holes punchedp70for nostrils , and out came the salt . Can you picture Connie'sface ? " James laughed . " I sure can , " he said . " Well , of course she had n't seen the thing , prior to my unwrapping it . She thought it was a bobby-pin holder or something . She said , Danny Hammond ! ' and made a grab for it , but I was too quick for her . I meant to keep it ; it 's not often I get such a personal present . But Connierushed him off like I would eat him and there I sat , all alone with my saltshaker . No one to thank . " " Maybe you could  --  " " I still use it , though . " " Ma'am ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I would too , " said James . " Then you see why he should n't have my picture . " That stumped him ; he had to consider a minute . ( If Miss Hattie Hammond was fading out , should he not just let it pass and agree with her ? ) But Miss Hattie seemed the same to him as ever , as sharp as a rock against the green of the lawn . " I do n't see what you mean , " he said . " Ah well . " " I do n't understand what pictures have got to do with it . " Not much , " she said . " But they 're photographing me because I 'm old , you know . They think I 'm dying . ( I 'm not . ) They think they 'll have something to remember me by . But pictures are merely one way , Mr. Green . Should a person that I like have a picture of me ? " " I would n't let it worry me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures anyway , once they get hold of them . " " I do n't want Danny remembering just a picture . Rememberingsomething flat and of one tone . What is ever all one way ? " " Well , " James said . He frowned down at his fingers , sticky now with dandelion mild . " Well , plenty of  --  " " Photographs , " said Miss Hattie , " are the only thing . Do n't interrupt . Everything else is a mingling of things . Photographers do n't agree , of course . Why else would they take pictures ? Press everything flat on little squares of paper  --  well , that 's all right . But not for people that you 'd like to stay interested in you . Not for Danny Hammond . " " Now , wait a minute , " said James , but Miss Hattie held up her hand . " I already know , " she said . " I know photographers . " James grinned and bent over his camera again . " As far as things that 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can name " No . Not a thing , not a person , Mr. Green . Take your picture . " He gave up . Through the frame of his view-finder he saw her standing just the way he wanted her , old-fashioned-lookingand symmetrical , with her hands across her stomach and her mouth tight . Her face was like a turtle 's face , long and droopy . It had the same hooded eyes and the same tenacious expression , as if she had lived for centuries and was certain of living much longer . Yet just in that instant , just as his hand tightened on the camera and his eyes relaxed at seeing the picture '  |p72the  way he had planned it , something else swam into his mind . He thought of Miss Hattie coughing , in the center of that family reunion  --  not defiant then but very soft and mumbling , telling them all she was sorry . He frowned and raised his head . " Well ? " said Miss Hattie . " Nothing , " James said . He bent down again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped the picture . For a minute he stayed in that position ; then he straightened up . " I 'm done , " he said . " I should hope so . " " I 'll get one copy made , for Mrs. Hammond . " " I 'm going in then . I 'm tired . " " All right , " he said . " Goodbye , Miss Hattie . " " Goodbye . " She nodded once , sharply , and turned to go , and James watched after her as long as she was in sight . Then he stared down at his camera . Just to his right Connie Hammond materialized  --  he caught a fold of lace out of the corner of his eye  --  but he did n't look at her . " Well , now ! " Mrs. Hammond said brightly . She was out of breath and looked anxious . She came around in front of him and went to stand where Miss Hattie had stood , with her eyes intent on the ground , as if by trackingdown the print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some understanding of her . " I 'm sure it 'll come out good , " she called over her shoulder . " Well . " " What 's that ? "  | " Yes , I 'm sure it will , " James said . He folded up his tripod and gathered the rest of his equipment together . " I 'm leaving now , " he told her . " Oh , are you ? " " I 'll have the pictures ready in a day or two . " " That 'll be fine , " said Mrs. Hammond . But she was still staring at the ground and looking anxious ; she did n't turn around to say goodbye . James 's pickup truck was parked on the road at the edge of the lawn . He circled around the children , being careful to stay clear of the ones playing statues . Their game was growing rougher now . Little Janice Hammond was frozen in the exact stance of a baseball pitcher , her right arm drawn back nearly out of joint , and even her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire set of braces on her teeth . But she unfroze just as James passed her ; she shook out her arms and smiled at him and he smiled back . " I want to come out pretty in them pictures , " she said . " You see what you can do about it . " " I 'll see . " He placed the camera on the leather seat of the pickup and then went around to the driver 's side and climbed in . It was like an oven inside . First he started up the motor and then he rolled down his window , and while he was doing that he caught sight of Maisie Hammond . She was standing high up on the lawn , waving hard to him and smiling . He waved back . This time when the heavy feelinghit his stomach he did n't shrug it off ; he sat turning it over in his mind , letting the motor idle . As long as he sat there , Maisie went on waving . And when he had shiftedp74into first and rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in the rear-view mirror and saw her still waving after him . He thought suddenly that she must be having two feelings at once  --  half one way and half another . Half angry at him , and half sorry because she had told him so . And now she had to keep on waving . He looked down beside him at the camera , where Miss Hattie was so securely boxed now in her single stance . But the fields he drove through shimmered uncertainlyin the sunlight ; the road was misted with dust , and he was driving home now not knowing if he wanted to go there or not , not knowing for sure what he thought about anyone . All he could do was put the heavy feeling out of his mind , and let only the road and the fields alongside it occupy his thoughts.  |p75THAT  SUNDAY , JOAN BEGAN thinking about Simon'shair . She started out by saying , " Simon , tomorrow morningfirst thing I want to find you in that barber 's chair , " but Simon said , " Aw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Since that movie yesterday he had changed his mind about town ; he had n't even asked to eat in a restaurant today , and Joan could see his point . Going downtown meant people murmuring over him and pattinghis head , asking Joan in whispers , " How is he taking it ? Is his mother coming out of it ? " while Simon stood right next to them , his chin tilted defiantly and his eyes on their faces . Little boys who were usually his friends circled him widely , looking back over their shoulders in curious , half-scared glances . They had never seen someonethat close to funerals before , not someone their own age . When Simon and Joan were coming out of the movie theater a member of Mrs. Pike 's church had stopped smack in front of them and said to her friend ,  | " Oh , that poor little boy ! " Her voice had rung out clearly and hung in. the air above them , making other people stop and stare while Simon pulled on Joan 's hand to rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never went downtown again . So instead of insisting , she said , " Well , all right . But we 've got to cut your hair at home then . Today . " " It 's not so long , " he said . " Curls down over your ears . " " Well , we 've got nothing to cut it with . " " Scissors , " Joan reminded him . " Your mother 's sewingscissors . Anything . " " Okay . Tomorrow , then , " said Simon . " Bright and early . " " Tomorrow 's a tobacco day ; I wo n't be here . You know that . " " Other boys have hair lots longer . " " Orphans do , " said Joan . " Will you fetch the scis-sors ? " He slid off the couch , grumbling a little , and went for his mother 's sewing basket . It sat in one corner of the living room , gathering dust , odds and ends of other people 's clothing poking out of it every which-way . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the women in Larksville . ) The materials on the top Simon threw to the floor , making a huge untidy pile beside the basket , and he rummaged along the bottom until he brought up a large pair of scissors . " These them ? " he asked , and walked away from the basket with that heap of material still lying beside it . Joan let the mess stay there . She followed Simon into the kitchen , ap77few steps behind him , with her eyes on the back of his head . Where it had been pressed against the couch his hair was as matted as a bird 's nest . It would take a sickle to cut all that off . In the kitchen she found an apron and tied it around his neck , to keep the hair from tickling , and then she had him sit on the high wooden stool beside the kitchen table . He revolved on it slowly , making the seat of it squeak , while Joan looked him over and debated where to start . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him . " When was the last time you went to the barber 's ? " " I do n't know . " " It could n't have been all that long ago . " " You sure you know how to cut hair ? " Simon asked . " Of course I do . " " Whose have you cut ? " " Well , my own , " Joan said . He stopped revolving and looked at her hairdo . " It 's a little choppy at the ends , " he told her . " It 's supposed to be . " " Will mine come out like that ? " " I surely hope not . " " If it does , what will we  --  " " Now , Simon , " Joan said , " I do n't want to hear any more about it . Let 's just get it over with . " He sighed then and gave in , but with his shoulders squinched up and his neck drawn into itself as if he thought she might slip and cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapping downwards like hay on a haystack . When Joan cut too much from one of the sun-yellowedp78upper layers it sprang straight up , choppy and jaggededged , and she quickly pressed it down again and shot a look at Simon to see if he had noticed . He had n't . He sat slumped on the stool , idly swinging one boot and gazing out the window . The only sound now was the steady snipping of scissors . Out in the back yard Joan could see her uncle  --  just his head and his crumpled blue shirt . He was tilting back on an old kitchen chair in the sunshine , with one hand resting absently on Nellie 's neck . That was the way he had been sitting all day . When Joan called him for his meals he came in docilely and ate everything set before him , and then he went out back again . Twice he had gone upstairs to see his wife , but that had taken only a minute ; he must have given up trying to talk to her . Even Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedroom , to where she was lying on her back with the covers pulled up around her , and asked her to come down for a bite to eat , her aunt only said , " No , " and closed her eyes . Saying that one word seemed to take all the strength she could muster ; Joan did n't dare argue with her . In the back of her mind she kept trying to think up little plots , planning ways to get her aunt interested in something , but she was n't the kind of person who could do that . The most she could do was try and take care of the house for a while , and feed Mr. Pike and Simon . Even that was hard ; she had never learned how to keep house . The top part of Simon 's hair was cut now . She squinted at it , not sure if this was how it was supposed to be or not . It seemed a little homemade-looking . But thenp79she shrugged and began on the shaggy part along the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on . Outside , Ansel called , " Is anybody home ? " His voice was thin and wavered in the wind . Simon gave a sudden start and turned his head , so that Joan nearly gouged him in the neck . " Hold still , Simon , " she said , and Ansel called again , " Is anybody home ? " " It 's him , " Simon said . " Who do you mean ? It 's Ansel . " " I know . It 's him . " " Just stop wiggling , " said Joan . She raised her voice and called out , " We 're out here , Ansel . " " Out where ? " " Out here . " " Well , is someone going to come and let me in ? " " It 's not locked , " Joan said , and returned to her cutting . She did n't like Ansel and had never pretended to ; he could open his own doors . When he came ambling out to the kitchen , walking in that shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did n't even turn around to look at him . " How are you , " she said , making it a statement . " Oh , not so bad , I guess . " " Turn a little to the left , Simon . " " Hey , Simon , " Ansel said . Simon frowned at his boots . " Hey , boy . " " He 's having his hair cut , " said Joan . " Ah , I see . That makes it impossible for him to speak . " " Will you have a seat ? " " I might , " he said . He pulled out one of the chairsp80from the table and sat down , facing Joan and Simon . He was looking better than usual today . The yellowish pallor of his face had faded and he sat nearly erect , with his arms folded across his chest . When he saw Simon frowning at him he smiled his dippy smile and said , " What 's the matter with the barber , boy ? " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't answer . Joan said , " I 'm cutting his hair myself this time . " " I see that . " " I 'm using the sewing scissors . " " I see . " That seemed to leave nothing more to be said . Joan hesitated a minute , with the scissors in mid air , and then she said , " Turn around , Simon . " " Are we done ? " Simon asked . " Almost . I want to think what to do about the front part of it . " " Where 's Mr. and Mrs. Pike ? " said Ansel . " Uncle Roy 's out back . " " Where 's Mrs. Pike ? " Joan was frowning at Simon 's hair , trying to figure out how to begin on that front shock . Any way she managedit , it was almost sure to end up looking like bangs . She snipped gingerly at one piece and held what she had cut off up to the light to examine it . Then she said , " Ansel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " Did n't James tell you not to bother her ? Where is James ? "  | " He 's taking pictures of the Hammonds . " " Did n't he tell you not to come around here ? " " Well , yes , he did , " Ansel said . " He suggested that I not . But I was sitting reading on the couch and it occurredto me : I thought I might just wander over and see how you all are doing . " " We 're doing fine , " said Joan . She snipped off another piece of hair . " Joan , you 're ruining that boy . " " It 'll turn out all right . " " Well . I was sitting reading a Guideposts , " Ansel said , " and after that two outdoor-type magazines , and then I read them again . I would 've read them a third time , if I had n't come on over here . I read even the smallest inchlongads for worm farms ; I read the list of editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I thought I might come and see you . " " Simon , maybe you better get a mirror , " Joan said . " I 'm not sure what you 're going to think of this . " " Aw , I do n't care , " said Simon . " Is it done ? " " You go look in a mirror and see if it is . " Simon stood up and little rags of hair fell around him , spilling off the apron around his neck . When he walked out of the room he trailed fuzz in a long path behind him . " He wo n't thank you for this , " Ansel said . " I do n't think it 's so bad . " " Twice before , I started to come , " Ansel said . " I got up and headed for the door and then I thought , No . ' I cut my fingernails . I cleaned out my wallet . Then I thought I might as well come over . I thought  --  "  |p82When  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingertips together , as if words came hard to hint and he had to consider . Yet in reality the words came flooding from him ; it always made her feel swept away and drowned , with so many useless words spilling around her . Sometimes she could even get interested in what he said , but she never lost that drowned feeling . While he talked she stood silently by the stool , keeping her face blank and idly snipping at thin air with her scissors , but inside she was thinking , I wish you would go . The pale thinness of his face irritated her . She thought about all the long evenings of three long years , with James sitting next to her on the porch and never taking one step forward , never asking for more than tonight 's kiss and tomorrow 's date and never mentioning marriage or a family or any of those other things she was sitting there waiting to hear . And the reason for it all was Ansel , who hung limp and heavy in his brother 's living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stronger than any of them . He had that flood of words , after all , and that sad dippy smile , and that way of placing his fingers together as if asking people to be patient while he fumbled for what to say . " I thought I would cone offer sympathy and then leave again , " he was saying , and Joan snapped , " Well , you 've offered it . Are you leaving ? " " Huh ? " Ansel said . He looked up , bewildered . " Joan , I ai n't even seen your Aunt Lou yet  --  " Simon came in , with his hair plastered down by water . " It looks kind of like I expected it to , " he said . " You do n't like it ? " " Well , yes . It 'll grow out . "  | " I could trim it around the edges a little more , " Joan said . " No , that 's all right . Thank you anyway . " " Or maybe tomorrow you could  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up straight , listening , and when the other two turned toward him he pointed at the ceiling . " Footsteps , " he said . It was the slow , clapping sound of Mrs. Pike 's mules , crossing the upstairs hallway . " She 's only going over to the bedroom , " Joan said , but then the sound continued to the stairs , and Ansel said , " She 's coming down . " He stood up , preparing to meet her . Joan reached out and touched his arm . " Let her be , " she said . " Why do n't you go home ? " " I wanted to say hello . " " Do it some other time . " " No , I want  --  " The footsteps descended slowly , like a child 's  --  both feet meeting on the same step , then another hesitant step downwards . Joan left the kitchen , with a wave of her hand toward Ansel to show that he should stay there . He did , which surprised her a little . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the stairs , looking up . Her aunt had just barely reached the halfway point . She was holding on to the railing and gazing steadily at Joan , her face blank without its makeup , her dark yellow hair straggly and uncurled , and her plump body wrapped in a chenille bathrobe . The grayness of her made her blend into the dark stairwell . She said , " Joan , " and her voice came out blurred and gray also , without expression . " What ? " Joan said.  |p84But  her aunt did n't answer . She continued down the stairs laboriously , and when she reached the bottom she would have gone straight into the kitchen except that Joan took hold of her by one arm . " Do n't you want to sit in the parlor a while ? " she asked . " I 'll bring coffee . " " No . " " Ansel 's out there in the kitchen . " " No . " Mrs. Pike went on walking , not pulling away from Joan but just walking off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow her . She dropped it . Her aunt said , " No , " again , as if some new question had been raised , but Joan was trailing behind her now in silence , frowning at Mrs. Pike 's back . Her back was soft and shapeless , and folded in upon itself at the waist where her sash was tightened . When she walked the hem of her robe flutteredout and Joan could see the dinginess where it had dragged across the floor . Ansel was standing , ready to greet her . He said , " Mrs. Pike , I been waiting to see you , " and Mrs. Pike said , " Ansel , " and crossed to one of the kitchen chairs . Over by the window Simon stood with his back to her , his hands jammed awkwardly in his pockets and his chopped-at , straggly head wearing a stiff and listening look . " I only came to tell you how I feel , " Ansel said gently . " Then I 'll leave . " " Where is Roy ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get him ? " " No. "  |p85Mrs  . Pike was sitting craned forward a little , with her hands on her stomach as if it hurt her . After a minute Ansel sat down opposite her , but Joan remained standingand Simon stayed by the window . Mrs. Pike did n't look at any of them . " I thought I would come downstairs a little , " she said . " That 's the way , " said Ansel . " You should n't sit alone . " " I was n't sitting . " " What I actually came to say , " Ansel said , " was how bad I feel about all this . That 's all I wanted to tell you . I told James , I said , It 's like the tragedy has struck at our own lives . I know just how she feels , ' I said . I said  --  " " No , " said Mrs. Pike . " Ma'am ? " But Mrs. Pike only looked away then , toward the screen door . Behind her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began tying knots in it , small tight knots running up and down the length of the cord . " What was you saying no for ? " Ansel asked . Mrs. Pike did n't answer . " Was you saying I do n't know how you feel ? Mrs. Pike , I know how you feel better than you do yourself . I been through this before . " " Ansel , " Joan said , " you 've offered your sympathy now . I think you 'd better leave . " " But I 've got so much I want to say to her  --  " " I came down to eat , " said Mrs. Pike , " but I do n't think I will . " Joan turned away from Ansel and looked down atp86Mrs . Pike . She said , " Why , Aunt Lou , there 's all kinds of things to eat in the icebox . Everyone 's been bringing things . " " No , " her aunt said . " I know that when my mother died , " said Ansel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They said that mourning has never brought the dead back . But it 's only right to mourn ; it 's only natural . People have their faults but when they 're dead you mourn them , and you expect to be mourned yourself someday . " " Janie Rose did n't have no faults , " said Mrs. Pike . " No , ma'am , of course she did n't . When my  --  " " We do n't know how it might have turned out . She was a little chubby but not , you know , really fat . She might have slimmed down some later on . I never said to her she was fat . I do n't know what she thought I said but really I did n't . Never a word . " " When my mother died , " said Ansel , " I thought of all the bad things I ever said about her . I got in a real swivet about it . She was a fine woman , but scared of everything . Would n't stand up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on she had a way of sort of humming underneath her breath , slow and steady with no tune , and sewing away at someone 's overalls without looking up . My father was  --  " Joan came over and stood between Ansel and Mrs. Pike , bending down low so as to make her aunt look into her face . " I want you to eat something , now , " she said . " There 's a stew . Would you like that ? " " No . " " There 's a whole icebox of things . "  | " No . " " My father was not what you 'd call a man of heart , " said Ansel , placing his fingertips together . " Very strict . We always kept two goats around the place , to eat off the underbrush  --  " " Is n't it funny , " Mrs. Pike said , " that no one sent roses . Roses are a very normal flower , yet nobody sent them . Everything but , in fact . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the spring , when the goats had kids , " said Ansel , " we would fatten them up for eating . Only by the time they were fat they 'd be good pets , and we would beg for my father not to kill them . We would cry and make promises . But my mother sat humming ( though she loved those goats the best of all and had names for every one of them ) and my father always killed them . Only there was one thing that made up for that  --  " " Ansel , " Joan said , " Will you go home ? " " Wait a minute . When my mother brought a roasted kid in , or any part of it , holding it high on a wooden platter with potatoes around it , she always dropped it just in the doorway between the kitchen and the dining room . It never failed . The meat on the floor , and the potatoes rolling about like marbles and leaving little buttery paths behind them . Pick it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about germs and never let us eat it . I have n't yet tasted a piece of roasted goat . I think about that often now ; it makes up for that humming , almost . I 'm sorry I ever  --  " Someone knocked on the front door . Joan said , " Ansel , will you go see who that is ? "  | " Why , Joan , it 's your house . " " I do n't care ; just go . " " I 'm not well enough to go bobbing up and down for people , " said Ansel . But he rose anyway , moving slowly like an old man and holding his chest . " Who is it ? " he called . " Is that you , Ansel ? " It was James , with his voice sounding loud and steady even though he was still outside the house . Hearing him made Joan straighten up and feel suddenly more cheerful , and Simon turned around and let the window-shade cord slip out of his hand . " Ansel , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 're you doing here ? " " I 'm looking for you . I been looking all over . " James had let himself in now , seeing that Ansel was n't advancing to the door very quickly . He crossed the parlor in long strides , and appeared in the kitchen entrancewith his hands on his hips . " I 'm taking you home for supper , " he told Ansel . " I 'm sorry about this , Mrs. Pike . " Mrs. Pike only gazed at him unblinkingly , without appearing to hear him . Joan said , " I wish you would , James . " " Come on , Ansel . " " Supper in the afternoon ? " asked Ansel . " It 's getting on towards sunset . " " Well , I do n't feel so good , James . I 'm not hungry . " " What 's the matter with you ? " James asked . " My head is swimming . " " You been resting enough ? "  | " Well , yes . But after lunch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , urn  --  " Joan leaned back against the table , watching . She had never seen James actually listen to all this before ; it seemed strange , and she could n't figure out why he was doing it . The more James listened , the more Ansel 's symptoms expanded and grew in detail ; even his face looked paler . But James kept on nodding , saying " Hmm , " every now and then . Finally he said , " I 'll put you in bed . You can have your supper on a tray , if you want . " " Oh , I think I 'll just stay here and  --  " " It 's time to go , Ansel . " Ansel sighed and let himself be led toward the doorwayby one elbow . To Mrs. Pike he called , " I hope you 're feeling better , ma'am . I 'll be back tomorrow , maybe , or the next day  --  " " Come on , " James said . They stopped trying to be graceful about it . James gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , almost on Ansel 's heels , to hurry him out . After her came Simon , with his face looking small and curious under his ragged haircut . Mrs. Pike did n't go with them . She sat quietly in her chair , with her hands still pressed to her stomach , and it was n't until the others were all the way into the parlor that she spoke . " Nobody knows , " she said distinctly . Ansel wheeled around , fighting off Joan 's and James 's hands , and shouted , " What 's that ? " Mrs. Pike did n't answer . " Let 's go , " James said.  | " I just want to tell you , " Ansel shouted toward the kitchen , " I know better than you can imagine , Mrs. Pike . You 're just sorry now you were n't nicer to her , but I know how it feels to really miss someone . I remem-ber  --  " Both James and Joan stopped then , looking first at Ansel and then back toward the kitchen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Mrs. Pike had changed positions . And that seemed to show Ansel what they had been trying to tell him all along : that Mrs. Pike was n't listening right now , and that nothing he could say would do her any good or any harm . So he shrugged and let himself be led the rest of the way out . When Joan stepped back a pace , indicating that he should go first and that she was staying in the house , he nodded goodbye to her gravely . " One thing I 'd like to make clear , Joan , " he said . He was facing her squarely , acting very formal and dignified . " I do know , " he told her . " All right , " Joan said absentmindedly . " I remember how it feels . My memory 's excellent . " " I believe you . " " Clutters my mind at night , it 's so excellent . " James pulled him gently . " When I want to sleep , it does . Clutters my mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He led him on out to the porch . When he passed Joan she could smell the smoky , outdoors smell of James 's hair , and he bent closer to her and said , " If you need anything , I want you to tell mc . " " I will . "  | " And when you can get away , come over and see us . " I will . " She stood in the doorway with her hand on Simon 's shoulder and watched after them  --  Ansel tall and thin and leaning against James , who was solider and could bear his weight . She heard Ansel say , " Right through my temples it is , James . A sort of spindle of dizzy-feeling , right through my temples . " James said , " We 'll lie you down . You feel tired ? " " Naw . I was thinking  --  " " You sure now , " James said . " Huh ? " " I want you to tell me . " " Tell you what ? " Ansel asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening with a frown because it was so strange to her , felt suddenly lost and uncertain . She retreated into the parlor again , letting the screen door swing slowly shut behind her . But there was no one to listen to what was bothering her . Only Mrs. Pike , staring at the wall in the kitchen , and Simon beside her with his funny new haircut.  | " Now , I CAN HAVE my ideas , " said Missouri , " and you can have yours . Mind what you 're doing there , Miss Joan . First off , I do n't believe in sitting . I have never believed in sitting . Minute a person sits his mind gives way . Will you watch what you 're doing ? " Joan sighed and handed her the next bunch of tobaccoleaves . It was Monday afternoon , late in the day but hot , and even here under the shade of the pecan trees she could feel the sweat trickling down between her shoulder blades . Beside her stood three other women  --  two handing to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other helping Joan do the handing to Missouri . Missouri was huge and black , and every move she made was a wide slow arc , but she could tie nearly as fast as Mrs. Hall . She stood at the end of her rod with her broad bare feet spraddle-toed in the dust , and first she yanked a handful of leaves from her daughterLily and then from Joan , wrapping each handful top93the rod with one sure circling of the twine so that the leaves hung points-down and swinging . If Joan or Lily was too slow with the next hanging she would click her tongue and stand there disgusted , holding the twine taut in her fingers , and when the leaves were ready she would take them with an extra hard yank and bind them so hard that the twine cut into the stems . Now it was Joan who was slow ( they were down to the last of this tableload , and she was having trouble finding a full handing of leaves ) and Missouri made her clicking sound and shifted her weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she called down the table to Mrs. Hall , " I bind across the stick . You bind on the same side , and I declare I do n't see how . With Miss Joan on the left , I take her leaves and bind them on the right , and backwardsfrom that with Lily . You follow my meaning ? " " Yes , and I think it 's just as inefficient , " Mrs. Hall said . She stopped her trying to brush a piece of wispy blond hair off her face . " That 's three inches wasted motion every bunch you tie , Missouri . " " Ha . Fast as I move , who cares about three inches . " " It adds up . You see if it do n't . " " Ha . " She yanked Joan 's bunch from her and lashed it to the rod . That finished up the stick ; it looked now like one long chain of hanging green leaves , with the rod itself hidden from sight by the thick stems that stuck up on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jimmy Terry raised himself from the side of the barn and set down his Coke bottle . By the time he had ambled over to Missouri she had lifted the stick from its notched standp94and stood making faces because of the weight of it , holding it very carefully so as not to crush the leaves . " Watch it , now , " she said , and thrust it at him , and he started back to the drying - barn while she bent to take another rod and lay it in the notches . " I was saying something , " she said . She tied the white twine around the end farthest from her and then snapped it off at a length of five feet or so , while Mrs. Hall stopped tying to watch her . ( Mrs. Hall spent every day of every tobacco season trying to figure out how Missouri snapped off her twine ahead of time without measuring it . ) " I was talking about sitting , " Missouri said , grandly ignoring Mrs. Hall . " This table is bare , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you sit , your blood sort of sits along with you . It do n't go rushing around your brain no more . Consequently , it takes that much more time to get rid of some sad idea in your mind . The process is slowed considerable . Whereas if you hurry your blood up some .. . There is a sizable amount of people could benefit from what I know . I could just go on and on about it . But do you get what I mean up to now ? " " Well , so far , " Joan said . " Good . Now , what started me on that  --  well , I do say . Took you long enough . " She was looking off toward the dirt driveway , where the men were just coming with the mule . Behind the mule was a huge wooden sled piled high with tobacco leaves , and it must have been heavy because the mule was objecting . He had stopped trying and began to amuse himself by blowing through his nose at the flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back he only switched his tail and gave an extra hard wheezep95through his nose . Mr. Terry pulled out a bandanna and wiped his face . " You stop that and bring him here , " Missouri commanded . " We 're out of leaves and getting paid for standinghere with our aim folded . " " Well , I would n't want that , " Mr. Terry said , but he went on wiping his face with his back to the mule . He was an easygoing man ; it was a wonder to the whole countryside how he ever got his tobacco in . Behind the sled was James Green , filling in for the day because Mr. Pike was at home with his wife , and he was n't doing anything about the mule either . His face was dark from the sun and glistening , and his hair hung in a wet mop over his forehead . When he saw Joan he grinned and waved , but he did n't look as if he gave a hang whether that mule ever moved , so Missouri heaved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , " she said , and circled the long picnic table where the women were standing and headed for the mule . " Jefferson , you no-good , you , " she told the mule , " you going to keep us waiting all day ? " " That 's not Jefferson , " Mr. Terry said . " That 's my brother Kerr 's mule , Man O'War . He 's only a distant cousin to Jefferson . " " I do n't care who he is . " She reached up and grabbed the mule by one long ear , as if he were a little boy , and pulled in the direction of the table . The mule followed , sighing sadly . " In the end , it 's the women that work , " Missouri told him . " Stand still now , you hear ? " " I wish it was Jefferson , " said Mr. Terry . " He was some good mule , old Jefferson . " " He sick ? " Missouri asked  | " Nah . Dead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . They know , them mules . " " Mr. Graves shot him down , " Mr. Terry said . He and James were both at work now , lifting armloads of leaves from the sled and carrying them over to the table . " He says he has the right , because Jefferson kicked his boy . " " Nah , that ai n't so . Only if Jefferson killed the boy , outright . Takes more than that to kill Sonny Graves . Sonny ai n't dead , is he ? " " Oh , no . " " Well , you go on and sue then . Go on and do it . " " Well , " Mr. Terry said . He took the mule and turned him around , and when he slapped him this time the mule headed back toward the fields with the empty sled skitteringbehind him . " We 'll let Saul take care of him , " Mr. Terry told James . To the women at the table he called , " That was the last load , there . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beer up at the house . " " Do n't you give Lem more than one , " Missouri said . " You know how he gets . " " Well . " He headed toward the house , wiping his face again with the bandanna , and James turned and said , " You yell when you 're ready to go , Joan . " " All right , " Joan said . When the men had left there was a different feeling in the air , blanker and stiller . The smell of sweat and mule and hot sun had drifted away , and for a minute the women just stood looking after them with their faces expressionless . Then Missouri said , " Well , " and she andp97Mrs . Hall took their places at their rods again and the others turned to the new heap of leaves on the table . " That James stays out in the sun much more , he 's going to change races , " Missouri said to Joan . " I guess he might , " Joan said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet  --  do n't let things show through . " " No . " Missouri waited , still without going back to her work . Finally she said , " Just where is he from ? " The others looked up . Joan said , " Oh . . . from around here , he says . " " Well , so are we all , " said Missouri . " But what town ? " " He does n't talk much about it . " " That 's kind of peculiar , " Mrs. Hall called . " You ever asked him ? " " He 's not wanted or nothing , is he ? " said Missouri . " No . " " You never know . I 'd been married two and a half years before I found out Lem had been married before . Mad ? I tell you  --  " " If I were you I 'd ask him , " Mrs. Hall said . " Well , I did , " said Joan . She was beginning to feel uncomfortable . " He told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , like Larksville  --  " " Then why do n't he say so ? " " Well , you know Ansel , " Joan said . " There 's an odd one . " " He does n't like for James to talk about it . He 's afraid James 'll send him back . "  | " Good thing if he did , " said Mrs. Hall . " You ever been invited to meet their family ? " " Well , no . " " They had some kind of falling-out , " Missouri 's daughter Lily said . Everyone looked at her , and she said , " Well , that 's what Maisie Hammond said . " " Maisie Hammond do n't know beans , " Missouri said . " Have n't you learned not to listen to gossip ? " " If I was you , Joan , " said Mrs. Hall , " I 'd just march right up and ask him . I 'd say , James , will you take me to meet your family ? ' Just like that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went on watching her , waiting for her to say more , but she did n't . She concentrated on grouping the leaves together by the stems , a small cluster at a time , so that they lay flat against each other , and then she held them out to Missouri and waited patiently until Missouri gave up and started tying again . Each time Missouri took the leaves from her there was a funny numb feeling in Joan 's fingertips , from the leaves sliding across layers and layers of thick tobacco gum on her skin . Tobacco gum covered her hands and forearms , and it had worked in between the straps of her sandals so that there was black gum on the soles of her feet . Tonight when she walked barefoot through the house she would leave little black tracks behind her . She rubbed the tip of her nose against a clean spot on the back of her hand , and Missouriclicked her tongue at her to tell her to hurry . " I want to get home , " she told Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed them to her . In her sleep she would see tables full of tobaccop99leaves , stack upon stack of yellow-green leaves with their fine sticky coating of fuzz and their rough surfaces that reminded her of old grained leather on book covers . Whenever she told her aunt about that , about dreaming every night of mules and leaves and drying barns , her aunt thought she was complaining and said , " Nobody asked you to do it . I even told you , I said it right out , I did n't want you doing it . Secretaries do n't work tobacco , honey . " But then Joan only laughed and said she liked seeing leaves in her sleep . " There 's lots worse I coulddream of , " she said , and Mrs. Pike had to agree . Missouri had started talking again , now that she saw Joan was n't going to answer any more questions . " Let 's get back to sitting , " she said . " What led me to speak of it was , your working and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , honey , do n't you mind Mrs. Pike . I know her , she feels like even James should n't of come . Feels like it shows disrespect . But look at it head-on and  --  " " Well , not disrespect , " Mrs. Hall called across . " Not that , exactly . But I see Lou 's point . I would n't have come today , Joan . I do n't mind telling you . " " What would I do at home ? " Joan asked . " Sit ? " " Exactly what led me to my discussion , " said Missouri . " What sitting does , is  --  " " You could have stayed around and helped out , " Mrs. Hall said . " Made tea and things . A person needs companyat a time like this . And James there , why , he is very close to being Janie 's cousin-in-law , or once removed , or whatever you call it  --  " Once again they all looked at Joan , but she went onp100grouping leaves and they sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mrs. Hall , " with his own brother on the verge of  --  " " Well , this is sort of pointless , " Joan said . " You just think one way , and me another . I do n't think she wants any more than her own husband there , and that 's what she 's got . And Simon too , if she wants him . " " Ai n't that a funny thing , " Lily said suddenly . " Up to last week , it was Janie Rose she never paid no attention to  --  " " You hush , " Missouri said . " This is Miss Joan 's relativeswe 're talking about . " " Well , I know that . Now , wo n't it Simon she used to brag on all the time ? Wo n't it Simon that was spoiled so rotten he  --  " " Hush . " " My feet are killing me , " said Mrs. Hall . Her second bander , the pale one named Josephine , looked down at Mrs. Hall 's feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her sneaker . " With me it 's sneakers or barefoot , " she said . " What you wearing leather shoes for ? " " Because I 'm older than you . I have to look decent . " She snapped off her twine and turned to the barn . " Boy ! " she called . " Will you look ? " said Missouri . " She 's a stick and a half ahead of me , and you two are poking along . Hurry it up , Lily . " Lily handed her the next bunch and then stretched , raising her thin black arms an enormous length above herp101head . To show her disapproval Missouri jerked her string with a twanging sound , and one of Lily 's leaves fell out of its bunch on the stick and landed in the dust . " Oh , Lord , " Missouri said . She handed her string to Joan and bent to pick up the leaf , holding the small of her back with one hand . A pink slip strap slid down over her shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said when she had retrieved the leaf . " Now it 's four thirty . When 'll it ever be five ? " " Wo n't help you if it is , " called Mrs. Hall , " so long as you 've still got leaves on your table . " " Well , I ca n't help it if they loaded the most leaves on me . " She pulled her strap up again and took the end of the twine away from Joan . " I was saying something , " she said . " I have that fidgety feeling , like I was n't fin-ished . " " Sitting , " Joan reminded her . " Sitting ? Oh , sitting . My lord , how long I been on that ? Well , anyway . " She snapped her fingers at Lily , who was gazing open-mouthed at a pecan tree , and Lily jumped and handed her another bunch of leaves . " Originally , " Missouri said , " I was getting around to a remedy for Mrs. Pike . Well , now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to start working again . " " Working ? " Lily said . " I did n't know Mrs. Pike worked . " " Will you hush ? " Missouri switched the twine to her left hand and reached across to slap Lily 's arm . " I do n't know where you spend all your time , Lily , " she said . She took up the twine in her right hand again and snatched Joan 's leaves from her . " Well , it so happens she doesp102work . She 's a seamstress . Teen-iney stitches and a Singer for her machine work . Miss Joan can tell you . Most of it 's altering things , but she makes things from scratch also . Reason you might not know , " she told Lily , " is she does it at home . Works in . A lot of right important people go there . Mrs. Lawrence , the judge 's wife , does  --  saw her drive up to the door once . Do you see what I 'm getting at , Miss Joan ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're saying this would snap her out of it . But being a seamstress is like working in a beauty shop  --  you have to carry on a conversation . And Aunt Lou just is n't capable right now . " " Of course not , " said Mrs. Hall . " Why , she just do n't have the heart to do that . Will you look at you people ? " " I got the answer , " Mrs. Hall 's first hander called . " I do n't see why you are all worrying . " She kept on handingas she spoke , thrusting precisely neat bunches at Mrs. Hall with lightning speed . " It 's like when you 've been sick , " she said . " They have to walk you around by the elbow a while . Well , Mrs. Pike needs to be walked around too , only in the talking sense . Joan here only works every other day ; she can spare the time . She can greet the customers and tell them the news and all , so 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then by and by Mrs. Pike 'll start to get interested in what Joan is talking about . She 'll begin uncurling and saying a few words herself . That 's why she was such a favorite before , Mrs. Pike was ; she could talk up a storm . " Missouri was watching her with her mouth open . " Charleen , " she said , when Charleen had finished speaking , " you are just as silly as you look , Charleen . Youp103must think Miss Joan is some kind of a walking newspaper . Do you ? She do n't say two words in a day , Joan do n't . Customers would drop off like apples in the fall , and Mrs. Pike would have one more reason not to get a grip on things . " " Silly yourself , " Charleen muttered , and bent closer over her pile of leaves . " Mrs. Pike 's no worse than my sister Mary was , " said Mrs. Hall . " When Mary 's oldest died she sat on the porch seven days and seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd mold , before we got her in again . Mrs. Pike is at least talking some . " " Not much , " Josephine said . She was scraping tobaccogum off her hands with a nail file while Mrs. Hall tied a knot at the end of her stick . " I went up to her at the burying and , Mrs. Pike , ' I said , I surely am sorry . ' And you know what she said ? She said , This is where Simon 's bedroom was going to be . ' I tell you , it scared me . " " Well , they were going to build a house there , " Mrs. Hall said . She slammed another stick in the stand . " I say they should have put Janie Rose by the church , but that 's a individual matter . " Missouri took off her straw hat and began fanning her face with it . " You can rest , " she told Joan and Lily . " We 're even now . Boy ? " " Yes 'm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joan and Lily leaned back against the table , half sitting on it , and Missouri tilted her head back so that she could fan her neck . " Sun 's about gone , " she said , " butp104still working . What was it I was thinking , now ? Lily ? " " Well , I 'm sure I do n't know , " Lily said . " Hush . Wait , now  --  oh . " She stopped fanning herself , clamped her hat on her head again , and bent for another rod . " Stop that standing around , " she commanded . " Charleen , I take it back . " " What ? " " What I said . I take it back . You only half silly . " " Oh , why , thank you . " " Only half as silly as you look . Stand up straight , Lily , you 're a mess . What 's that all over your hands ? " " It 's tobacco gum , what you think ? " " Oh . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching closely , and reached for Joan 's leaves . " I 'm a little vague , but I 'm thinking , " she said . Then she frowned into space for a while . Finally she said , " Growingold surely do damage a person . " " Well , is that what you 've been getting ready to say ? " Mrs. Hall asked irritably . " Oh no , " Missouri said . " It was something entirely different . I was working up to something . " " You were talking about Aunt Lou , " Joan reminded her . " Well , I know I was . If you all would just let me  --  " " Personally , " said Mrs. Hall , " I think this is a lot of fuss for nothing . You think it 's something wrong if Mrs. Pike sticks to herself a few days . Well , something is wrong . Somebody died . And that 's all I 'm going to say . "  | " It 's just as well , " said Missouri . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You said , " Missouri reminded her , " you said that was all you was going to  --  " Mrs. Hall sighed and turned her back , muttering something but not attempting to argue any more , and Missouri nodded to herself several times . " There now , " she said . " Now , what was I  --  ? " But when Lucy clicked her tongue in exasperation , exactly like her mother , Missouriwaved her free hand at her to tell her not to speak . " Now I remember , " she said . " Growing old surely do  --  Well . Anyway . Now , of course we 're not saying anything'swrong with Mrs. Pike . Sure she 's sad . Going to go right on being that way , always a little sad to the end of her days . But that do n't stop us from trying to make her feel better ; that 's just natural . We all got reasons . Maybe we want to stop remembering the dead ourselves . Or a host of other reasons . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , you , " she said to the fly , and then reached out for Joan 's leaves . Joan was holding the leaves too high and far away , and Missouri had to snap her fingers at her . " Come on , " she said . Joan came to life and handed the leaves over . " Anyhow , " said Missouri . " Now I 've lost my place again . Where was I ? " " Mrs. Pike , " Joan said . " Mrs. Pike ? Oh , her . Well , no , I was passing on to someone else . What's-his-name . What 's his name ? "  | " Mr. Pike ? " Lily suggested . " Just hush . Though he 's in this too , of course . No , just hush  --  Simon . That boy of theirs . You know him , Joan ? " " He 's my cousin , " said Joan . " Oh , yes . Yes . Simon . Going to go to pieces if things go on this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , no . " " It 's as plain as the nose on  --  Boy ? Come on , now , quit that poking . I 'm saying it 's Simon should be in her beauty shop with her . " " In her  --  ? " " I mean in her sewing shop . Look what you done now , got me all confused . Well , that 's who you want . " " You mean he should entertain the customers , " Joan said . " That was my point . " " Well  --  " " He 's the only one can help now . Not hot tea , not people circling round . Not even her own husband . Just her little boy . " " I do n't see how , " said Joan . Missouri made an exasperated face . " You do n't know , " she told her . " You do n't know how it would work out . Bravest thing about people , Miss Joan , is how they go on loving mortal beings after finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell you that ? " She snapped her twine tight and held it there while she watched Joan scrape up the last of the leaves . " I despise finishing the day on half a stick , " she said . " Well , I 'll be , " said Charleen . She leaned back against the table , shaking her head and watching Mrs. Hall tiep107the end of her stick . " I never . Was that what you did all this talking to say ? " " It was , " said Missouri . At the other end of the table , Mrs. Hall suddenly looked up . " That 's true , " she said slowly , but when they turned toward her she only shook her head . " That 's true , " she said again , and lifted her tobacco rod gently from its notches and handed it to the waiting boy.  |p108JAMES  WAS HALFWAY THROUGH his second beer before he saw Joan coming toward him . He was sitting on Mr. Terry 's porch , leaning back against the side of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men talking , and the beer can was making a cold wet ring on his knee . There were four other men there , all sitting just like he was in a line against the house . Maybe if Joan had n't come he would have sat with them till supper , just to rest up from the long day 's work and let the breeze dry his damp shirt . But then Mr. Terry said , " If you 'll look out yonder  --  " and James raised his eyes toward the fields and saw Joan padding down the dirt driveway in bare feet with a sandal swinging from each hand . " Out yonder to the east is what I mean to cultivate year after next , " Mr. Terry went on . He had been saying that for as long as James had known him . " I aim to extend the alfalfaa bit . No sense in letting good land grow wild , I say . " James only nodded , not really listening . Hep109squinted his eyes so as to see better  --  Joan was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly and gently along the dusty wheel-tracks . Her head was bent , so that her hair fell forward and nearly hid her face . Way behind her were the other women , going in the opposite direction toward town , and once they turned back and waved at Joan but she did n't see them . The women bobbed on , farther and farther , until all that showed of them was their bright dresses between the tobaccorows and two huge black umbrellas shading Lily and Missouri from the sun . " I also been thinking about the eight acres out back , " said Mr. Terry . " They 're Paul Hammond 's , but he 's not using them . " " No , " James said . " You listening ? " Joan had reached the edge of the Terrys ' front yard . She crossed onto the grass , sliding her feet a little as if she liked the coolness of it , and Mr. Terry stopped talkingand the others sat forward and took their hats off . " Hey , Joan , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the steps and smiled up at them . " Lem , " she said , " Missouri sent you a message . She said to come right on home . " Lem tipped back again in his chair , shaking his head . " Must be a mistake somewheres , " he said . His eyes were faraway and dreamy , and the others laughed softly . " Well , anyway , " said Joan . " I came to see if you 're ready to go yet , James . Or do you want to stay on a while . " " No , I 'm ready . "  |p110He  finished his beer in one gulp and stood up . Down at the end of the porch , Howell Blake looked up from cleaning his fingernails with a pocket knife and said , " You coming tomorrow ? " " Depends on Roy Pike , I guess . Looks like he 'll be sitting with his wife a while . " " Well , just so 's one of you makes it , " said Mr. Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You tell him , Joan . " " I will . " James went down the steps toward Joan , and she switched one sandal to the other hand so that he could take her free hand in his . Both of them were coated with tobacco gum . The gum had lost its stickiness by now but it still clung to their skin in heavy layers , so that it was like holding hands with rubber gloves on . He kept hold of her anyway , and turned partway back to nod at the others . " See you tomorrow , I guess , " he said . " I or Roy , one . " " Okay . So long . " " So long . " They crossed the yard together and then they were on the dirt driveway again , heading toward the gravel road . When James looked down , he could see the dust rising in little puffs around Joan 's toes every time she took a step . Her toes were gum-covered too , and the dust had stuck to them like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bath , " Joan said , as if she had been following his eyes . " No . I like you this way . " " I 'm serious . You have to have one too , and then we can sit outside and cool off . "  | " Okay , " James said . He pulled her along faster , because he liked the idea of just the two of them sitting out on the porch a while . But Joan slowed him down again . " I have to put on my sandals to walk fast , " she said . " Do you want me to ? " " No , that 's all right . " But she bent down anyway , and James stood waiting while she slid her feet into the sandals . She was wearing bermudas and a faded blue shirt with the tails out , and when a breeze started up it ballooned out the back of her shirt and made her look humpbacked . He put one hand on the hump . It vanished , pressed flat by the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her backbone through the thin cloth of her shirt . It seemed to him he knew Joan 's clothes by heart . He could tell the seasonsby them , and if she bought something new , he felt uneasy and resentful toward it until it had become wornlooking . When spring came he never really felt it until those old cotton shirts had come out again , though for days he might have known about the bits of green on the trees and the flowering Judas buds by the side of the road . He smiled down at Joan now and she straightened up and looked at him , not knowing anything about what was going on in his mind . " What 're you thinking ? " she asked him . " Nothing . " They turned onto the gravel road , holding hands again . A station wagon drove past , clanking and rattling as if it would fall apart before their eyes , and Joan waved at whoever was driving but James did n't look up.  |p112He  was concentrating on the gravel beneath his feet , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finallyhe said , " I 've got an idea . " " What ? " " How about coming over and cooking supper tonight ? We could sit out and eat it on the porch . " " You know I ca n't cook . " " Well , hot dogs is all right . " He dropped her hand and put his arm around her , so that he could feel her shoulder moving against his rib cage as they walked . They were going very slowly now ; he had stopped caring if they never got anywhere at all . He would like to go on down this road indefinitely , with everything around him shining and wearing a clean , finished , end-of-the-day look . The sun picked things up slantwise , and the fields were very still in between the gusts of breeze . When they rounded the bend and their house appeared , long and shabby with its tin roof batting the sunshine into their eyes , it seemed surprising and out of place . Both of them slowed down still more to stare at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race you home . " " Now ? " " Come on . " She started running , moving in bursts of uneven speed and letting her hands stay open instead of doubling them into fists the way most people did . Beside her , James ran at a slow easy pace because he did n't want to leave her behind . When he ran like this he was scarcely breathing hard , but Joan was out of breath and laughing . They reached the edge of the yard , and she stopped to tuck herp113shirttails in . " You were n't even trying , " she told him . " That was no race . " But he reached out for a tall blue spiky flower and presented it to her gravely , as if she had won , and she accepted it . " When you coming over ? " he asked . " In an hour or so . I have to take a bath and see that the others eat . " " Can you leave your aunt ? " " I 'll see how she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands together , with the stem of the flower between them . " Hey , Nellie , " she said . " That you ? " The bushes beside the lawn rustled and the dog poked just her head out , her nose pointed upwards . " Where you been ? " Joan asked her . She made little coaxing motionswith her hands . For a minute James watched , and then when it looked as if Nellie would be a long time making up her mind to come he turned toward the house . " I 'm going on in , " he called . " All right . Come on , Nellie . " James crossed the yard and climbed the steps at his end of the porch . In the seat of Ansel 's chair was a rumpled magazine , which he picked up to take inside with him . " I 'm home , Ansel , " he said in the doorway . But Ansel did n't answer , and his couch was bare . " Hey , Ansel ? " On the coffee table was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly with the hollow sides up.  |p114This  must have been one of his bored days , spent wanderingaimlessly through the house with an occasional pause to glance over some possession of his before he grew tired of it and began wandering again . But he had n't been flipping through James 's photographs , the way he usually did on those days . And he was n't in the kitchen , or up in his room . " Ansel ? " James called once more , and his voice rang out into a waiting , ticking silencethat worried him . He went outdoors again . Joan was still in the yard , sitting on her heels and patting Nellie . When she saw James she said , " You 're supposed to be in the tub by now , " but James only shook his head . " I ca n't find Ansel , " he said . Joan stood up then and came over to the porch . " He 's probably just gone visiting , " she told him . " Did you look for a note ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll be back . " " I do n't know . I want you to check your aunt 's for me ; I do n't like bothering her . " " All right . " She turned and made a kissing sound at Nellie , who danced after her toward the porch . " It 's time for your supper , " Joan told her , and then led her through the Pikes ' door by snapping her fingers high above Nellie 's head . After they had disappeared into the house James stayed out on the porch , waiting to see if Joan had found his brother . If she had , she would need help coaxing him out . He had a sudden clear picture of Joan backing out the door again , snapping her fingers at Ansel to lead him forward the way she had led Nellie.  |p115He  smiled , and then relaxed and swung one foot up onto the porch railing . But when Joan came out she came alone . " He 's at the Potters ' , " she said , before James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Simon would n't let him in . He went on to the Potters . " " Well , maybe I 'll just check , " said James . " Oh , he 's all right , James . What 's got into you lately ? " " I just want to make sure , " he told her . " I wish you 'd come with me . If I go alone I 'll never get out , once they start to talking . " " Well , all right . " She came over to stand beside him , and he knocked on the Potters ' door . There was no screen on it , because they did n't need one ; they kept the inner door shut . Summer and winter their part of the porch had a closed , unbreathing look , and they had long ago paid James two dozen cinnamon buns for taking the baggy old screen door off its hinges and carting it out back . When James knocked there was first a faint movement of the paper shade  --  they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of two bolts sliding back . The door cracked open ; Miss Faye poked her round face out . " Why , James , " she said . " Hello , Miss Faye . " " And Joan too . Both of you together . Joan , honey , do n't you look fresh and outdoorsy today . I was saying to Miss Lucy just a  --  well , step on inside , step in . " " Actually , " James said , " I just wanted to see if you had Ansel here . " " Ansel ? " She had the door wide open now , and wasp116throwing back one arm to show that they were welcome . James kept trying to peer past her , hoping to see Ansel , but the way the Potters ' house was arranged made it impossible . They had set up a labyrinth of tall black folding screens with needlework flowers on them , so that the house was divided into a dozen or more tiny rooms . No matter how James craned his neck around Miss Faye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens behind that . " Oh , Ansel , " Miss Faye was saying . " James , I worry about that boy . I was saying just a while ago ; I said  --  are you coming in ? Do n't stand outside ; come on in . " " We 've only got a minute , " Joan said gently . " Is Ansel here ? " " Well , let 's see . " She stepped further back , leaving them the whole doorway to enter through , and after a minute the two of them came in . Who could tell what might be hidden in this maze of screens ? The air was dark and stale , from being separated into so many cubiclesin a tightly closed house . And there was a thick feeling to the walls that must have come from the heavy tapestries , because every place else in this house was shell-thin . When they were inside , Miss Faye shut the whole world behind them out ; she said , " Now , " and slammed the door and slid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him uneasy , being locked in this way ) but Joan only looked amused . " You were going to tell us if Ansel 's here , " she remindedMiss Faye . " Yes . Yes , I was saying  --  Lucy ? Lucy , are you coming to say hello ? "  |p117They  heard Miss Lucy 's footsteps , sounding very faint and taking a long time to weave in and out among the screens . First she came close and then went farther away again , and suddenly she popped out right behind Miss Faye . She wore a huge white apron with jokes about outdoor barbecues printed all over it . " Lucy , look who 's here , " said Miss Faye . " Well , is n't this nice ? " Miss Lucy came towards them with both hands outstretched , making James wonder , just as he always did , what he was supposed to do when she reached him  --  hug her ?  --  but Joan saved the day by stepping up and taking both Miss Lucy 's hands in her own . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and then gave a little giggle and shook her tight cap of curls . " We 've had so much company today that I 'm getting all  --  " " Well , that 's really what we came to talk about , " said James . " Are n't you going to sit down ? " " We wanted to ask  --  " " You have to sit down . " She began backing around the first screen , still holding Joan 's hands . James glanced over at a puffy plush chair , with its layers and layers of antimacassars , and then shook his head . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " but it looks like Ansel is n't here , and that 's what we came about . " " Oh yes . Yes , he was here . " " When ? " James asked . " At three o'clock today , on the nose . No , more like three fifteen . I forget , Faye ... " " It was three twenty exactly , " said Miss Faye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had looked down at it , while checking to see if my blouse was clean , just before I answered the door . And it was Ansel at the door . Will you sit down , please ? " " That was nearly two hours ago , " James said . " No , you 're wrong , James . " " Well , it 's way past five . " " Oh , it was nearly two hours ago that he came , all right . But it was more recently that he left , because he stayed to have a jam braid . " " Well  --  " " Also a glass of milk . I said , Ansel , we 've got to get some meat on your bones . ' So did Miss Lucy . She said so too . Ansel said , Oh , Miss Faye , I just do n't know . ' He was feeling sad . " " What about ? " asked James . " He did n't say . Well , you know how he is . Some days the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he put it . Miss Faye , ' he said , some days the world is just too much for me . ' He told Lucy that too . Miss Lucy , ' he said , some days the  --  ' " " Did he say where he was going ? " " Why , home , I reckon . " " I have to leave , " James said . " Oh , now . You only just  --  " " I 'm sorry , Miss Faye . Come on , Joan . " He reached the door before Miss Faye could , and he slid the bolts back himself , with Miss Faye 's hands flutteringanxiously above his . Then he shot out on the porch , not even trying to be polite about it . Joan followed , but with her head turned toward the Potters , herp119voice drifting back to them as she tried to smooth everythingover . " I 'm sorry we have to leave this way , " she said , " but I know you see how it is  --  " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did . " Just please come back , " Miss Faye told them , and James nodded tiredly and let the door swing shut . The two bolts slid back into place . When they were outside again James just stood there , trying to think where to begin . Joan did n't seem worried at all . She said , " I got tobacco gum all over Miss Lucy 's hands . " " That 's too bad , " James said absently . " She was staring at her hands all funny-like ; that 's how I noticed . Little bits of black were sticking to them . " James turned around and looked at her . " Will you listen ? " he told her . " I ca n't find Ansel . " " I 'm sorry , James . " She grew serious , and came over to stand beside him . " He 'll come back , " she said . " I do n't know . " " He always has before . " " Well , I just do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stayed that way , looking down the porch to see who might be coming along the road . No one was in sight . " We do n't know what might have happened , " he said . Joan squatted down beside him and said , " Well , he 's come back every other time , James . " " You already said that . " " I just meant  --  " " I know he comes back . I been through this a hundredp120times . If I did n't even go looking for him , he 'd come back . But I ca n't be a hundred per cent sure of that . " Down the road came a red hen , strutting importantly , sticking her neck far out as if she were heading someplacedefinite . As she walked she talked to herself , in little conversational clucks . James and Joan watched after her until she had disappeared . " Somehow I ca n't get what Maisie said off my mind , " James said finally . " How would I feel if just once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame but me , if that happened . " " Maisie who ? " Joan asked . " Maisie Hammond . " " Well , if you did go after him , you know how it 'd be . You ever seen Ansel standing on a street corner waiting for you ? He goes somewhere you 'd never think to look , James . You go up and down town all night searching for him , waking every drinking man to ask him if he knows , and where does it get you ? You always end up right here , waiting for him to decide to come back . " " I like to think I looked , " James said . " I know that . " She stood up again , and the cotton smell of her shirt floated past him . " I can see it better than you can , " she told him . " I do n't like him . I can see easier than you how he will always come back . " " You ca n't see . " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Things were getting better for a while . You were n't fussing over him , and he had almost stopped wandering off . Why have you started acting this way ? " He stared down at her feet , long and dirty in sandalsp121that had molded themselves to the curl of her toes . Her feet made him so angry that he almost did n't answer her . But then she looked down at him , with her face worried and unsure , and he said , " I do n't know . " " Well , there 's got to be some reason . " " Will you stop asking me that ? You do n't have a brother . " " Maybe not , " Joan said , " but there is nothing I like or understand about you going to look for Ansel all the time . If he wanted he could have done a full day 's work today , and been off at a dance right now . " " No , he could n't . " " Yes , he could . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace . We could be doing something . We could be someone besides an old familiar couple that 'll be courting when they 're seventy and the town 's fondest joke . Are you listening ? " " No , " James said . He got up off his knees and went down the porch steps . Bits of tobacco gum and dust from the floorboards clung to the knees of his pants , but he did n't brush them off . The sunset glowed red and dull across the roof of the pickup . " Do n't bother fixing supper , " he called . " I would n't think of fixing supper . " He stopped and looked back at her . She was standing at the edge of the porch now , with her arms folded and her feet planted solidly apart . " I wish you 'd wear some real shoes once , " he said . " What ? " " I 'm sick of those sandals . " " Well , I 'm sick of everything , " Joan said.  |p122Her  voice was flat now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her one more time , but by then she had turned away and was walking down the porch . " Joan ? " he said . She went on walking , not answering . From behind , her folded arms gave her a thin , roundshoulderedlook , and she stepped in that gentle way she had , with her bare pointed heels rising and falling delicatelyacross the long gray porch.  |p123AT  NIGHT , WHEN EVERYONE was in bed , the houseseemed to belong to one family instead of three . The separate sleeping-sounds mingled and penetrated through all the thin walls , and by now James could identifyeach sound exactly and where it came from . He knew Miss Faye 's snore , as curlicued and lacy as she herself was , and the loud , honking sound that Mr. Pike made . He knew Miss Lucy 's rat-a-tat on the walls , first on Mr. Pike 's wall when the snoring grew too noisy and then on his own wall if he talked in his sleep . He thought it must be a thimble she tapped with . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house and the Pikes ' end , he was n't sure of the softer sounds there  --  Simon 's snoring , for instance , or Mrs. Pike 's . And he had always wondered if Joan snored . But he had heard Janie Rose 's nightmares often enough . They came through loud and clear , drifting up from the open window of her tacked-on bedroom downstairs . " That 's notp124something you should be doing , " she would say reasonably . And then , " Daddy , would you come quick ? " and the floundering thuds across the floor as Mr. Pike began groping his way toward her voice in the dark . But if Simon talked in his sleep , he must have talked quietly . All James heard of him was in the morning , when they tried to wake him and he bellowed out , " Oh , fine , I 'll be right there ! I already got my socks on . Ai n't this some day ? "  --  yet all the while sound asleep , and just trying to fool people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many beers on a Saturday night and throw all the pillows out the window . " Ninety-nine point two per cent of all the people in the southern states die of smothering , " he would roar to the night , and then Miss Lucy would rap on the wall . Miss Lucy never slept at all ; James was convinced of that . She spent her time policing the area . On nights when Ansel was restless , when he tossed around on his old wooden bed across the room from James ( he would n't sleep in the other bedroom , for fear of waking alone and finding his feet numb ) , and when he kept calling , " James , how long has this night been going on ? " Miss Lucy would tap very gently and ask if Ansel wanted her hot water bottle . " No , ma'am , " James always said , and Miss Lucy would go back to her quiet , patient pacing . Sometimes James had a great urge to go see what she was wearing . He pictured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , like the ones sewn into curtains , because it dragged so loudly across the floor at every step she took . But once he had had a horrible nightmare , right after eatingp125two pizzas . He had shouted out , " My God ! " and awakenedshaking , with the terrible sound of his own shout still ringing in his ears . Then Miss Lucy had tapped and called , " Why , it 's going to be all right , " and the horror vanished . He had lain back down , feeling comforted and at home , and now it never annoyed him to hear Miss Lucy 's bathrobe dragging . In the Potters ' bedroom the clock struck four , whirringand choking before each clang . James lay tensed , counting the strokes , although he already knew how many there would be . He had slept only in patches all night , and even in his dreams he was searching streets full of people for the thin stooped figure of his brother . In the last dream it had been a year ago  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Ansel had been run over , but neglected to add it was only a bicycle that had done it . After that he could n't sleep at all . He thought of all the things that had happened to Ansel in the past , the really serious things , and all the things that might be happening to him tonight . When the clock had stopped whirring he found that he was frowning into the darkness so hard that the muscles of his forehead hurt . Then , as if that clock had been some sort of musical introduction , a faraway voice began singing outside : There 's sunshine on the mountains , And spring has come again ... . James sat up and pulled back the curtain . Outside it was pitch black , with a handful of small stars scatteredp126like sand across the blue-black sky . The trees beyond the field were only hulking dark shapes , and not one light glimmered from the town behind them . My true love said she 'd meet me , But forgot to tell me when . He climbed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At his bedroom wall there was one sharp tap , questioning ( he had learned to read Miss Lucy 's thimble language ) , and he called , " It 's all right , Miss Lucy . " She resumed her pacing again , with her robe trailing her footsteps like a murmuring companion . James shot out of his room , still buttoning his pajama top , and went downstairs in the dark . The voice was nearer now . I was walking down the track , Lord , With a letter in my hand , A-reading how she 'd left meFor that sunny Jordan land . The front door was open but the screen was hooked shut . James pushed the hook up , jabbing his finger , and swung the screen door open . Then he walked across the porch barefoot , with the cold rough grain of the wooden floorboards stinging the soles of his feet . Around his ankles the cuffs of his pajamas fluttered and ballooned and nearly tripped him ( they were Ansel 's , and too long ) ; he bent to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dark as he tried to see . He was halfway down the path before he stopped , more by sens/ing someone in front of him than by seeing him . Ahead of him was a long tall shape , swaying gently , smelling of bourbon . The voice was so close now that James could feel its breath . Oh , there 's sunshine on the hills , Lord , And the grass is all of gold ... . His reedy roice was piercing , but the thinness of it made it seem still far away . James stepped closer . " Ansel , " he said . My love has gone and left me , And I 'll cry until I 'm old . " Ansel , " James said again . " I 'm singing , please . " " Come on in . " He took Ansel by the arm . It was stone cold ; he could feel the bone underneath . When he pulled Ansel toward the porch Ansel came , but lifelessly and with the shadow that was his face still averted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the dark . " They got a thing about it . " Careful , " said James . " We 're coming to the steps . " " The Potters downright lock you in . Slide little bits ofmachinery around . You mind if I finish my song ? " " I certainly do . " " I might just finish it anyway . Where you taking me , James ? "  | " In , " said James , and half lifted him up the first step . Ansel was as limp as a rag doll . His limpness made James realize suddenly how angry he was at Ansel , after all this worrying and waiting ; instead of guiding him so carefully , he felt like giving him a good shove into the house and having done with it . " Get on in , " he said , and took his hand away from Ansel 's arm . Ansel gave him a deep lopsided bow and entered first . " Certainly nice of you to ask me , " he told James . " Certainly are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansel  --  " " I 'm starved . " " Cook up some eggs , " said James , and began making his way across the dark living room toward the stairs . Behind him Ansel said , " Hey , now  --  " but James paid no attention . The way he felt , he could n't even make a cup of coffee for Ansel ; he had been worrying for too long , and all he wanted now was sleep . Already he was unbuttoning the tops of his pajamas , preparing to go back to his bed . " Do n't you have food waiting ? " Ansel asked . " Nope . " " Do n't you even care if I come back ? " " You know how to fry an egg . " " ' Well , I 'll be , " said Ansel , and sat down suddenly on something that creaked . " I take it back , James . What 's so hospitable about you ? " The stairs were narrow , and James kept stubbing his toes against them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bubbles of the wallpaper as he slid his fingers along it . Behind him Ansel said , " You madp129at me , James ? " but James did n't answer . He could alreadyhear the tapping sound that was coming from upstairs . Miss Lucy must be worried . " I reckon you 're wondering where I was at , " Ansel said , and there was another creak when he stood up again . " You always do wonder . " He banged into something , and then his footsteps wavered uncertainly toward the stairs . " You 're taking all my places from me . Once I tell you , I ca n't go back no more . How long you guess it 'll be before I 've used up every place there is ? " He was climbing the steps behind James now . His voice rang hollowly through the stairwell . For a minute James paused , listening to him coming , and then he continued on up and reached the top , with his hand still on the wall so that he could find his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ansel said sadly . " Time and geography . " " If you 're coming to sleep in my room , " James told him , " you 'd better shut up that talking . " " Well , I only want to explain . " " I 'm sleepy , Ansel . " " I only want to explain . " James kept going , heading in the direction of Miss Lucy 's tapping thimble . He could hear Ansel 's hands sliding along behind his now on the wall , and then the sliding sound stopped and there was a click as Ansel snapped the hall light on . For a minute the light was blinding . James screwed his eyes up and said , " Oh , Lord  --  " and Ansel turned the light off again , quickly and guiltily . " I just thought , " he said , " as long as we had electricity  --  " " It 's four a.m. , Ansel. "  | " What 're you , wearing my pajamas ? " " Go to hell , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but James was past listening . He was in the bedroom now , and on his way to bed he reached out and knocked on Miss Lucy 's wall for her to stop that tapping . She did . He eased himself down between the sheets , which were cold already and messyfeeling . When he was lying flat he closed his eyes and wished away the figure of Ansel , standing like a long black stick and swaying in the bedroom doorway . " I wisht I knew what was wrong with you , " Ansel said . " You angry with me , James ? " " Yep . " " I only went out for a walk . " " You usually end up half dead after those walks . It 's me that 's got to nurse you back . " " Well , wait now , " Ansel said . " I can explain . All you need to do is listen . " " How can I listen when I 'm asleep ? " asked James , and turned over on his side with his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffling into the room , and he knew by the soft thumping noise that he had reached the other bed and was sitting on it . " I tried and I tried , " Ansel told him . " I went to the Pikes ' first off , but Simon do n't like me any more . I went to the Potters ' , and they locked me in and requested news of my hemoglobin . What could I do ? At the tavern I said , Charlie , ' I said , I got a problem . ' But all Charlie did was sell me hard liquor under the counter ; he did n't listen to no problem . " Ansel 's shoes were dropped on the floor , first one andp131then the other . There was a small whipping sound as he flung his tic around a bedpost . Even with his eyes shut James could picture his brother , how he would be leaningtoward James with his shoulders hunched and his hands flung out as he talked , even though he knew he could n't be seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Ansel only sighed and began unbuttoning his shirt with tiny popping sounds . " This all has to do with Janie Rose , " he told James . " Are you listening ? " " No . " " Just about everything has to do with Janie Rose these days . I do n't know why . Looks like she just kind of tipped everything over with her passing on . Janie do n't like gladioli , James . " James did n't answer . A button flew to the floor and then circled there for an endless length of time , and Ansel stamped one stocking foot over it and shook the whole house . James could feel the floorboards jar beneath his bed . There was a long silence ; then Ansel bent , with a small puff of held-in breath , and scrapped his fingers across the floor in search of the button . " Got it , " he said finally . " All today , I was so sick and tired . I had looked at that picture of the Model A too long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I thought , well , I 'll just go up the hill and pay my respects to Janie Rose . I 'll go slow , so as not to get overtired . And I did . I stopped a plenty on the way . But when I got close I saw her flowers , how they had got all wilted . I thought : I wisht I 'd brought some flowers . I thought : I wisht I 'd brought some bluets . You listening , James ? "  |p132James  gritted his teeth and stayed quiet . " There 's four names for bluets I know of . Bluets , Quaker-ladies , pea-in-the-paths , and wet-the-beds . You can count on Janie Rose ; she called them wet-the-beds . ' Well , she had problems herself in that line . But what I thought was : I wisht I 'd brought some bluets . I did n't think : I wisht I 'd brought some wet-the-beds . " " Oh , Lord , " James said tiredly . He turned his pillow to the cool side and lay back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good funeral flowers . Too teeny . But Janie Rose is not a funeral person . Usually it 's only the good die young . Consequently I thought : I wisht I 'd  --  " James raised his head and shouted , " Ansel , will you hush ? " and on his wall there was the sudden sound of frantic tapping . " I do n't want to hear , " he told Ansel more quietly , and then lay back down and forced his mind far away . " I 'll just get to the point , " Ansel said . " I have to tell you this . James , there are gladioli on Janie 's grave . " James heard a zipper slide down , and after a minute a pair of trousers was tossed shufflingly across the floor . Then Ansel 's socks dropped one after the other beside his bed , in soft crumpled balls , and James heard them fall and winced because his ears seemed raw tonight . " Janie Rose despises gladioli , " said Ansel . James said nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wands , all frilled up . She told me so . " James opened his eyes and rolled over . " Funerals are for parents , " he said . " Ansel , Janie Rose is dead . "  |p133He  waited , frowning . Out of the corner of his eye he could see the white blur that was Ansel in his underwear , standing before the bureau with his skinny arms folded across his chest . Finally Ansel said , " I know . " " She 's dead . " " I know all about it . Nevertheless , she despises glad-ioli . " " The funeral is not really for her , " James said , and rolled over again to face the wall . " It do n't make any difference to her about those gladioli . " " Oh now , " said Ansel . " Oh now . " He crossed to his bed , heavily . " It 's hard to bury people , Jamie . Harder than digging a hole in the ground . " " Will you go to bed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of speak-ing . " James dug his head into his pillow . " I remember Janie Rose 's religious period , " Ansel went on comfortably . " It was a right short one , would n't you know . But she took this tree out back , this scrubby one she was always drawing flattering pictures of . Dedicatedit to God , I believe ; hung it with tin cans and popcorn strings . Did n't last but a week ; then she was on to something new . The birds ate the popcorn . But those tin cans are still rattling at the ends of the branches when a wind passes through , and Mr. Pike sits out back all day staring at them . Thought he had placed every last bit of her in a hole in the ground . Ha . " James reached behind him for the sheet and pulled it up over his head , making a hood of it . The rustling of the sheet drowned out everything else , and then when hep134was still again the sounds could n't come through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he sat down was muffled and distant , and his voice was thinsounding . " I ought to studied botany , " he was saying . " Do n't you think ? All I know about flowers , I ought to studied botany . " James lay still , and stared at the dark vines running up the wallpaper until his eyes ached . " With Mama it was lilies , " said Ansel . " Lord , she hated lilies . All she wanted , she said , was just a cross of  --  " " We wo n't go into that , " James told the wallpaper . " We do n't go into nothing . Getting so the only safe topic around here is the weather . Well , I was saying . Just a cross of white roses , she wanted . No lilies . And you know what they sent ? You know what ? " He waited . The silence stretched on and on . James 's arm , pressed beneath his body , began to go to sleep , but he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiggled his fingers gently , without making a sound . " Well , they sent lilies , " Ansel said finally . " I thought you would have guessed . If you 'd been there , I would n't have to be telling you all this . But I called you . I called you on the phone and said , James , ' I said , will you kindly come to Mama 's funeral ? ' I called you long distanceand person-to-person , Caraway to Larksville . But you never answered me . Just hung up the telephone , neat and quiet . If I was the persistent type , I 'd be asking still . I 'd ask it today : James , will you kindly come to Mama 's funeral ? ' Because you never have answered ,  |p135never  once , not once in all these years . I 'll ask it now . James , will you kindly  --  " " No , I wo n't , " said James . Across the room there was a little intake of breath , quick and sharp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began again , with the weighted bathrobe sighing behind it . Ansel lay down on his bed . " There 's two kinds of sin , " he said after a minute . His voice was directed toward the ceiling now , and sounded dreamy . " There 's general sin and there 's private sin . General sin there 's commandments against , or laws , or rules . Private sin 's a individual matter . It 's hurting somebody , personally . You hear me ? Listen close now ; this is essential . ' What I chose was a general sin , that they 'll be a long time forgiving . I did all that drinking , and ran around with that girl that everyone knew was no good . But what you chose was a private sin , that they 'll never forgive . They got hurt personally by it  --  you forever running away , and telling them finally what you thought of them and leaving home altogether . Then not coming to the funeral . Think they 'll forgive that ? No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someday . But not you . I 'm a very wise man , every so often . " James did n't say anything . Ansel raised himself up on one elbow to look over at him , but he stayed within his hood of sheets . " James ? " Ansel said . " What . " " You do n't care what I say , do you ? " " Yes , " James said . " Do n't it bother you sometimes ? Do n't you ever thinkp136about it ? Here we are . You walked off from them without a backward wave of your hand , and I got thrown out like an old paper bag . Do n't it  --  " " Got what ? " James asked . " What ? " " You got what ? " " Got thrown out , I said , like an old  --  " " You never got thrown out , " said James . " I did . Daddy said I was an alcoholic ; he said I was  --  " " He never said that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave this house , ' he said . You and your drinking and that girl in red pedal pushers , I never want to see you again . ' That 's what he told me . " James raised himself slightly from beneath the hood of the sheet . He peered across the dark room toward Ansel and said , " Do n't you give me that , Ansel . " " What ? " " You left . You left , I left . Tell it that way . " " Well , what difference does it make ? Who cares ? " " I care , " said James . " Do I make excuses for leaving ? Run out on him or do n't run , but do n't make it easy on yourself ; do n't tell me he kicked you out . " " Well , " Ansel said after a minute , " I was drinking all that  --  " " You do n't even like the taste of it , " said James . " I do too . " James lay back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice rose louder . " It has a wonderfulp137taste , " he said . And then , " Well , maybe he did n't exactly throw me out , but anyhow  --  " Up on the tin roof , rain began . It started very gently , pattering in little sharp exclamation points that left spaces for Ansel 's voice . " James ? " Ansel said . " Hmm . " " There 's one thing I do n't get , James . It was you they liked best . The others were n't nothing special , and I was so runny-nosed . I had a runny nose from the moment I was born , I think , and pinkish eyes . One time I heard Daddy say , Well , if there 's ever a prize for sheer snivelinessgiven , he 'll take it , ' and Mama said , Hush , now . Maybe he 'll grow out of it . ' They did n't think I heard them , but I did . " " They did n't mean that , " said James . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did you leave ? Why did n't you come to the funeral ? I said , Daddy , ' I said , you want I should ask James to Mama 's funeral ? ' Which James is that ? ' he asks . James your son , ' I tell him . And he says , Oh . Oh , why , anything you want to , Ansel . ' This was when I was still home and they had hopes I would change my ways ; they let me do some things I wanted . I called and said , James , will you kindly come to Mama 's funeral ? ' Then he asked what happened . Ansel , ' he said , did you invite that person you had mentioned previously ? ' And I said no , figuring it was better that way . Daddy said , He would n't have come . He was born that way , ' he said , lacking our religion . There was no sense asking him . ' " The rain grew louder . Now it was one steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be heard was his words ; the quality of his voice was drowned out . " I 'm going back there sometime , " he was saying . " They 'll forget , and I 'll go back . I crave a religious atmosphere . " He lay back down and James nodded to ' himself , thinking maybe he would be sleepy now . " Churches here are somewhat lacking , I think , " Ansel went on . " Quiet-like . At home it was better . Mrs. Crowley spoke in tongues . There was things that bound you there . A red glass on the windowsill in the choir loft , with something brown rising above it like the head on a beer . I think now it was wax , and the glass was a sort of candle . But before I thought it was a sort of brown fungus , some kind of mold just growing and growing . Do you remember , James ? " He waited a minute . " James ? " he said , and now his voice had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring of the rain . " No , I do n't , " James said . " Sometimes I think your mind is just a clean , clean slate , James . " " I keep it that way , " said James . " You do . I bet when I go back you wo n't even miss me . I 'll go and bring presents . A natural-bristle hairbrushfor each sister and a table game for Claude , and a French briar pipe for Daddy . Flowers for the grave and a set of them new , unbreakable dishes to go in the kitchen . A conch shell with the crucifixion inside to make up for that one you dropped , and a crane-necked reading lamp ... "  |p139The  rain roared on , and James listened to that with all his mind . He thought it was the best sound he had heard all day . The heavy feeling was beginning to fade away , and the rain was lulling him to sleep. " ... a new swing , " Ansel was saying , " though none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a tire we swung on . It was all right and it went high enough , but there was n't no comfortable way to sit in it . Inside it , your legs got pinched . Straddled above it , you 'd be dizzy in no time what with all that spinning . Stop ! ' you 'd say , and cling like a monkey on a palm tree while everybody laughed . . . "  |p140ON  TUESDAY MORNING , Mr. Pike was the second personawake . He arrived in the kitchen wearing his work clothes and carrying a nylon mesh cap , and when he sat down at the table he sat heavily , stamping his boots together in front of him and scraping the chair across the linoleum . " I 'm picking tobacco today , " he told Joan . Joan was at the stove , peering into the glass knob on top of the percolator to see what color the coffee was . When her uncle made his announcement she said nothing , because she was thinking of other things , but then she turned and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said . " I 'm going to pick tobacco , " he repeated . " Oh . All right . " But he still seemed to be waiting for something . He folded his big bony hands on the table and leaned toward her , watching , but Joan could n't think what was expected of her . She picked the coffeepot off the stovep141and carried it over to the sink , in order to dump the grounds . " We need the money , " her uncle said . Joan shook the grounds into the garbage pail , holding the coffee-basket by the tips of her fingers so as not to get burned . " Well , sometime I got to start work , " he said . " Of course you do , Uncle Roy . " " Things are getting worse and worse in this house . I thought they 'd get better . " " Pretty soon they will . " " I wonder , now . " He watched as Joan set his cup of coffee before him . She handed him the sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd never seen one before . " Sugar ? " Joan prodded him . He shook his head , and she set the bowl down at his elbow . " It 's no good sitting in a room all my life , " he said . " Drink your coffee , " Joan told him . She poured a cup for herself and then sat down opposite him , hitching up the knees of her blue jeans . Her eyes were still foggy from sleep and things came through to her blurred , in shining patterns  --  the blocks of sunlight across the worn linoleum , the graduated circles of Mrs. Pike 's saucepan set hanging on the wall , the dark slouched waiting figure of her uncle . When she stirred her coffee with a kitchen knife that was handy , the reflection of the sunshine on the blade flashed across the wall like a fish in a pool and her uncle shifted his eyes to that . He watched like a person hypnotized . She set the knife down and the reflec/tion darted to a point high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . " You going to want sandwiches ? " she asked . He did n't answer . She took a sip of her coffee , but it was tasteless and heavy and she set the cup down again . " Putting my foot down , " her uncle mumbled . Joan drew lines on the tablecloth with her thumbnail . Outside a bird began singing , bringing back all the spots and patches of restless dreams she had had last night , in betweenlong periods of lying awake and turning her pillowover and over to find a cool place . Ever since the rain stopped those birds had been singing . She rubbed her fingers across her eyelids and saw streaks of red and purple behind them . " In regard to sandwiches , " her uncle said suddenly , " I do n't want them . I 'll come home for lunch . " " All right . " " Least I can do . " " All right . " " What 's the matter with you ? " he asked , and reached finally for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . I think it 's the best thing you could do . Do n't forget to tell James he wo n't need to work today . " " I thought you 'd do that , " said Mr. Pike . " " You can . " " You 're not working today ; you can spare a minute . " " No , I 'd rather you do it . " " Oh now , " Mr. Pike said suddenly . " You two have a fight ? " Joan took another sip of coffee . It still had no taste . Ap143hummingbird swooped down to the window and just hung there , suspended like a child 's bird-on-a-string , its small eyes staring curiously in and its little heart beating so close and fast they could see the pulsing underneath the feathers . Mr. Pike gazed at it absently . " I never did hold with long engagements , " he said . " What ? " " Longer the engagement , the more time for fights . Should n't allow it , Joan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And anyway , it 's none of my doing . " Her uncle looked away from the hummingbird and frowned at her . " I do n't know about that , " he said . " And I 'll tell you . Some men need a little shove . " " I do n't believe in shoving . " " Only way , sometimes . I ever tell you how I came to marry your aunt ? " " I 'm not in the mood for that , " said Joan . " I was only going to mention . " " No , I do n't want to hear , " she said , and pictured suddenly her aunt , no longer young , lying so still upstairs . " You go tell James , " she said . " Aw , Joan . " " Someone has to . " " Aw , Joan , you know how it is . I 'll go over and there will be Ansel , all talkative and cheerful . Cheerful in the morning  --  can you feature that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ansel ? No . I heard him come in long after midnight just singing away , and I reckon he sang all night and is singing still . Where 's Simon ? "  | " In bed . " " Been days since I seen that boy . Send him over . " " He wo n't go either . " " Look , " said Mr. Pike . He stood up , jarring the table , and the hummingbird flew away without even preparing to go . " I ca n't see Ansel today , " he said . " I do n't know why but he gets under my skin nowadays . Will you please go ? " " Oh , all right , " Joan said . " All right , that 's settled . Thank you very much . " He sat down again , and Joan went back to looking at the patterns in the kitchen . Everything she saw made her homesick , but not for any home she 'd ever had . The sunlighton the linoleum reminded her of something long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with a linoleum kitchen , never in all her memory . She kept staring at the design of it , the speckled white floor with bars of red and blocks of blue splashed across it , and the sun lighting up the dents and scrapes made by kitchen chairs . Finally she looked away and into her uncle 's frowning , leather-brown face , but her uncle only said , " We need the money , " so she looked away again . Her coffee had cooled , and the surface of it was greasy-looking . She drank it anyway . When her uncle was through with his coffee he pushed the cup toward the center of the table and rose , clamping the mesh cap on the back of his head . " You can take care of things here , I guess , " he said . " Yes . " " I 'll be running along , then . " He clomped off toward the front of the house , swing/ing his boots in that heavy way that Simon always tried to copy . His steps made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open with a twang of its spring and then slam shut again , rattling on its hinges . Then the clomping continued across the porch , and she waited for the extra-heavy sound of his boots descending the wooden steps to the yard but it did n't come . " Joan ? " he called . " What . " " Joan ! " She rose and went out front , wondering why men always had to shout from where they were instead of coming closer . Her uncle was standing on the edge of the porch with his back to the house and his cap off , scratchingthe back of his head . " What is it ? " she asked him , and he turned toward her . " Well , I already informed your aunt , " he said , " but I 'm not certain she heard . " " Informed her about what ? " " About my working . But I 'm not certain she heard . Will you tell her again ? " " All right , " said Joan . " Say we need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All right , Uncle Roy . " " I ca n't sit looking at trees all my life . " " No , I know , " said Joan , and reached out to give his shoulder one gentle push so that he would turn and leave . He did , still frowning . Then halfway across the yard he slapped his cap back on his head and thrust his hands in his pockets and began walking more briskly , getting ready to go out into the world again . Joanp146watched after him till he was out of the yard , and then she went down toward the Greens ' end of the porch . Ansel was in his window , chewing sunflower seeds . He looked very happy . He spit the hulls out on the porch floor and then leaned over , his hands on the windowsill and his elbows jutting behind him like bird wings , and tried to blow the hulls all the way across the porch and into the yard . Joan wished he would fall out . She stood over him with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again , and then she said , " Ansel . " " Morning , Joan . " " Ansel , will you give James a message ? " " If I can remember it , " said Ansel . " My health is poorly this morning . Seems to be growing worse and worse . " " Does n't look to me you could get much worse , " Joan said . " At least you noticed . James just do n't even care . He 's in a ill mood today . " Joan gave up on him and stepped over to the door and knocked . For a minute Ansel stared out his window at her , puzzling this over ; then he shrugged and withdrew . He came to the door and opened it with a flourish . " Morning , Joan , " he said . " Where 's James ? " " Ai n't seen you in a long time . James ? He 's in the back yard , emptying out the garbage . " " Will you tell him he does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're planning to forget I 'll just do it myself . "  | " Oh , I 'll tell him , " Ansel said . " Come in and set , why do n't you . Old James 'll be back any minute . " " No , thank you , " said Joan . " Well , suit yourself . " He yawned . " Saw your uncle go off to work this morning , " he said . " Seems kind of soon for him to be doing that , do n't it ? " " No . " " Well , I just thought I 'd point it out . " He yawned again and fished another sunflower seed from the packet in his hand . The shirt he had on was James 's , she saw . It was a dark red plaid and hung too loosely on him . She stared at it a minute and then , without a word , turned and went back up the porch . " Hey ! " Ansel called after her , but Joan was inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut behind her . Upstairs , Simon was sound asleep , with his pajamaed legs sprawled and all his covers kicked loose from the foot of the bed . Joan went over and touched him gently , just on the outflung , curled-in palm of his hand . He stirred a little and then mumbled and turned away from her . " Get up , Simon , " she said . " I am up . I am . " " Come on . " " I 'm half dressed already . I got my  --  " " Simon . " He opened his eyes . " Oh , light , " he said , and Joan smiled and sat down on the bed beside him . " I got something I want to talk over , " she told him . " Okay . "  | " You listening ? " " I just ca n't find any clean jeans , " he said , and closed his eyes and was asleep again . Joan picked up his hand and shook it , but it hung loose and limp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 'm listening . " " I think your mother should start working today . " He turned over and squinted at her , through foggy brown eyes . " What at ? " he asked . " At her sewing . I want you to stay around and help with the conversation , all right ? Missouri says I 'm no walking newspaper . " " What ? " " Will you help me out ? " " Oh , why , sure , " Simon said , and would have been asleep again if Joan had n't pulled him to a sitting position . He stayed there , slumped between her hands , with his head drooping to one side . " I was in this boat , " he said . " Come on , Simon . " " Then we started sinking . They told me I was the one that had to swim for it . Do you believe that 'll happen someday ? " " No , " said Joan , and pulled hard on him till he was standing beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , " Simon told her . " It 's true . Last year I dreamed Mama would find out about me smoking and sure enough , that night at supper there was my half-pack of Winstons lying besidemy plate and Mama staring at me . It came true . "  |p149He  bent down to examine a stubbed toe and Joan stood up , preparing to go . " You come down when you 're dressed , " she said . " I do n't have any clean jeans to wear . " " That 's just something you said in your sleep . You have lots of jeans . " " No , really I do n't , " Simon said . " No one 's been doing the laundry . " Joan crossed to his bureau and pulled open his bottomdrawer . It was bare except for a pair of bermudas . " Oh , Lord , " she said . " I forgot all about the laundry . " " I told you you did . " " Well , wear bermudas till this afternoon , why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans . " " Have my knees show ? " Simon asked . " What 's wrong with that ? " " Boys do n't have their knees out any more . You ought to know that . " " Well , la de da , " said Joan , and rumpled the top of his hair . " Wear a pair of dirty jeans , then . " " They 'd all call me sissy if my knees showed . " " All right . Hurry up , now . " She closed the door behind her and went downstairs . In the parlor she sat down on a faded plush footstool and reached for the telephone , which sat on a table beside her . She hooked the receiver over her shoulder and then opened the telephone book to the very back , where there was space for frequently used numbers . The page was filled to the bottom , and looked messy because of so many different handwritings . Mr. Pike had listed thep150names of bowling pals in a careful , downward-slanting script , and Simon had scrawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to them by telephone , and Janie Rose had printed names in huge capitalsthat took two lines , after asking several times how to spell each one  --  the four little Marsh girls , each listed separately , and the milkman who had once brought her a yellow plastic ring from a chicken 's leg , which she had worn every day until she lost it . Mrs. Pike 's handwriting was small and pretty , every letter slanting to the same degree , naming off her steady customers one by one with little memos to herself about colors and pattern numbers penciled in lightly beside them . Joan went down the list alphabetically . Mrs. Abbott , who never talked . Mrs. Chrisawn , who was in such a black mood most of the time . Davis , Forsyth , Hammond . . . She stopped there . Connie Hammond was always good to have around duringa tragedy . She brought chicken broth whether people wanted it or not , and she knew little things like how to make a bed with someone in it and what to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Joan was concerned , having a person talk incessantly would be more harm than help ; but her aunt felt differently . Her aunt had actually sat up and answered , the last time Connie Hammond came . So Joan smoothed the phone book out on her knees and dialed the Hammonds ' number . Mrs. Hammond was talking to somebody else when she answered . She said , " If that 's not the worst thing  --  " and then , into the phone , " Hello ? " " Mrs. Hammond , this is Joan Pike , " said Joan.  | " Why , Joan , honey , how are you ? " Mrs. Hammond said , and then softened her shrill voice to ask , " How 's your poor aunt ? " " Well , that 's what I wanted to talk to you about , " said Joan . She spoke at some distance from the receiver , in case Mrs. Hammond should grow shrill again . " What 's that you say ? " " I said , I wanted to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , my . " There was a rustling sound as Mrs. Hammondcupped her hand over the receiver and turned away . " Lou Pike is just miserable , " she told someone . Her hand uncupped the receiver again and she returned , breathless , to Joan . " Joan , honey , I told Mr. Hammond , just last night . I said , I have n't ever seen someone take on so . Well , of course she has good reason to but the things she says , Joan . It was n't her fault ; it was that noaccountNed Marsh who did it . How he manages to drive even a tractor recklessly is more than I can  --  " " Um , " Joan said , and Mrs. Hammond stopped speakingand snapped her mouth shut audibly , to show she had been interrupted . " Um , she has n't even gotten up today . She 's still in bed . And Uncle Roy 's at the tobacco barns  --  " " The where ? " " Tobacco barns . Working tobacco . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , he ca n't just sit staring at the trees all  --  " " He could comfort his wife , " Mrs. Hammond said . " She wo n't listen . So I was thinking , as long as he'saway today  --  "  | " Men are like that , " Mrs. Hammond said . " Work is all they think about . " " As long as he is at work , " Joan said firmly , " I think maybe Aunt Lou should start working too . " " Working ? " " Working at sewing . Missouri said  --  " " Mrs. who ? " " Mrs.  --  never mind . Wait a minute . " Joan switched ears and leaned forward , as if Mrs. Hammond could see her now from where she stood . " Mrs. Hammond , " she said , " I know how good you are at helping other people . " " Oh , why , I just  --  " " I know you could help Aunt Lou right now , if anybodycould . You could bring that dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Lilac , " said Mrs. Hammond . " Princess style . " " That 's the one . " " Lou said it would add to my height a little , a princess style would . " " That 's right , " Joan said . " That 's the one . " " Especially since it has up-and-down pinstripes . " " Yes . Well , I was thinking . If you could just bring it over and get her to work on it for you , just take her mind off all the  --  " " You might be right , " said Mrs. Hammond . " Why did n't I think of that ? Why , the day before the funeral , when I came  --  you remember  --  I did feel she was doing wrong to sit so quiet . I said so . I have always believed that baking calms the nerves , so I said to her , Lou , ' I said , why do n't you make some rolls ? ' But she looked atp153me as if I 'd lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dozen , and a cake besides . Yet I felt she ought to be doing something ; that 's what I was trying to tell her . You just might be right , Joan . " " Well , then , " said Joan , " do you think you could come over sometime today ? " " I 'll come over right this minute . I just would n't feel at rest until I had . You say your aunt 's still in bed ? " " She was a minute ago , " Joan said . " Well , you try and get her up , and I 'll be there as fast as I can find the dress . I 'll be there , do n't you worry . " " All right , " Joan said . " It certainly is nice of you to come , Mrs. Hammond . " " Well . Goodbye , now . " " Goodbye . " Joan hung up and sat back to rub her ear , which felt squashed . Now that all that was settled , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to back her up in this . Simon was standing in front of his mirror when Joan came in . He was wearing blue jeans but no shirt , and scratching his stomach absently . " Hey , " Joan said , and he jumped and looked up at her . " Find yourself a shirt , " she told him . " Connie Hammond 's coming . " " Aw , gee , Joan . Mrs. Hammond ? " " She 'll be here any minute . Come on , now . It 's a specialfavor to your mother . " " I bet she 'll never notice , " Simon said , but he pulled a bureau drawer open . Joan closed the door and went on to her aunt 's room . Mrs. Pike was sitting up against two pillows , fat andp154soft in a gray nylon nightgown . She had her hands folded across her stomach and was looking vaguely at the two points her feet made underneath the bedspread . " Good morning , " Joan said , and Mrs. Pike raised her eyes silentlyand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way through mist . But she never answered . After a minute her eyes passed on to something else , dismissingJoan like the wrong answer to a question she had asked . Joan came to stand at the foot of the bed . " Aunt Lou , " she said , " would you like to get up ? " Her aunt shook her head . " Mrs. Hammond 's coming . Do you want her to find you in bed ? " " No , " said Mrs. Pike , but she did n't do anything about it . She settled lower into the pillows , with her eyes worrying at the wallpaper now , and in so much dim clutter she appeared to be sinking , overcome by the objectsaround her . Under Joan 's feet were cast-off clothes , everywhere , everything her aunt had been persuaded to put on in the last few days . She had stepped out of them and left them there , returning wearily to her gray nightgown . Mr. Pike , on the other hand , had made some effort at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the platform rocker , where they rose in a layered mountain that seemed huge and overwhelming in the half-dark . On the bureau were hairbrushes and bobby pins and old coffee cups with dark rings inside them . The sight of it all made Joan feel caved in and despairing , and she went over to raise the window shade but the light only picked up more clutter . " Aunt Lou , " she said , " we just have to get organized here . "  | " What ? " " We have to start cleaning things up . " Her aunt nodded , without seeming to pay attention , but then she surprised Joan by moving over to the edge of the bed and standing up . She stood in that old woman'sway she had just acquired  --  searching out the floor with anxious feet , rising slowly and heavily . For a minute she stood there , and then she shook her nightgownout around her and faltered toward the bureau . " I 'm going to clean up , " she told Joan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once she reached the bureau , was to stare into the mirror . She put both hands on the bureau top and leaned forward , frowning into her own eyes . The alarm clock in front of her ticked loudly , and she reached out without looking to set it farther away . " Some people stop all the clocks when someone dies , " she said . " What 're you going to wear , Aunt Lou ? " " If Connie Hammond 's coming , why , she 'll have to turn around and go off again . " " What dress are you going to wear ? " Joan asked , and the sharpness of her voice made Mrs. Pike sigh and stand up straight again . " Any one will do , " she said . She pulled out a small plastic box from a half-open drawer and began putting bobby pins into it . One by one she scraped them off the top of the dresser , working like a blind woman with careful fingers while she kept her eyes on the mirror . Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little clinking sound against the bottom of the plastic box , andp156each time the sound came Mrs. Pike winced into the mirror . " My grandmother stopped all the clocks , " she said . " She would also announce the death to each fruit tree , so that they would n't shrivel up . But we do n't have no fruit trees . " Her fingers slid slowly across the bureau top , and when she found that all the bobby pins were picked up she closed the box and set it down again . Then she went back to bed . She tucked her feet down under the covers and drew the top sheet with great care over her chest . " No , wait , " Joan said . " I did what I could , Joan . " Joan went over to the closet and pulled out the first thing she touched , a navy blue dress with white polka dots . " Is this all right ? " she asked . " No . " " This , then . " And she lifted a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without waiting for an answer . " It 's the prettiest one you 've got , " she said . Outside , a car screeched to a halt and sent up a spray of gravel that Joan could hear from where she stood . She looked out and saw Mrs. Hammond 's Pontiac swerving backwards into the yard with one sharp turn of the wheel , while Mrs. Hammond herself remained rigidly facing forward . The car came to rest right beside James 's pickup , within an inch of running over Simon 's bicycle . Then Mrs. Hammond shot out , clutching bits of cloth and tissue paper to her chest and leaving the car door open behind her . All she needed was an ambulance siren . Joan leaned out the window and called , " Mrs. Hammond ? " and Mrs. Hammond looked up , with her fact startled and worried-looking.  | " Just walk on in and come upstairs , " Joan told her . " Aunt Lou 's in bed still . " " Oh . All right . " She bent her head over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear her quick sharp heels along the porch and then inside , across the parlor floor and up the stairs . " Oh , law , " she was saying to no one . She sounded out of breath . But Mrs. Pike did n't say a word to all this . She just lay back against the pillows and folded her arms across her stomach again , her face expressionless . When Mrs. Hammond burst into the room and said , " Why , Lou ! " as if Mrs. Pike had somehow taken her by surprise , Mrs. Pike only nodded gently and watched the wallpaper . " Lou ? " said Mrs. Hammond . " She was just now getting up , " Joan told her . " Well , I 'll help . That 's what I came for . " She set her load down on the dresser and peered into the mirror a second , pushing back a wisp of hair , and then she came over to sit on the edge of the bed . Every move she made was definite ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its swampiness . Her face was carefully made up to cover the little lines around her mouth , and she was packed into a nice summery sheath that Mrs. Pike had made two years ago . The sight of so much neatness made Mrs. Pike sit up straighter and pull her stomach in , even though her face stayed blank . " I was talking about stopping all the clocks , " she told Mrs. Hammond . " Oh , no . " " I 've about decided to do it . " " Oh , no . I do n't think that 's necessary . "  | " But Mrs. Pike said , " Yes . I do n't know why I did n't think of it before . " " It depends on the type , " Mrs. Hammond said . " Ormolu , for instance , or mahogany  --  that you would stop . But those are the only kind . Is n't that so , Joan ? " Joan had n't heard that before , but she said , " Well , yes , " and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only if it 's ornamental , " she told Mrs. Pike . " Oh . I did n't know that . " " You would n't stop a Baby Ben or anything . " " No . " " Do you want to get up ? " " Connie , I just ca n't , " Mrs. Pike said . " I just do n't have it in me . You 're going to have to go off again . " " Oh , now . " Mrs. Hammond shook her head and then began examining the room , as if anything Mrs. Pike said was to be expected and she was just planning to wait till it was over . " This place could use a bit of cleaning , " she said . " Also , if I was you I 'd add some patches of color to it . You know ? I put an orange candlestick in Mr. Hammond'sbrown den and it just changed the whole atmosphere . He do n't like it , but you 'd be amazed at the differenceit makes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Pike said distinctly . " Now , Lou . " " I just want to sleep a while . " " After you make up my lilac dress , I 'll let you sleep all you like , " said Mrs. Hammond . " I need it for a party . "  |p159She  stood up and went over to the bureau , where she pulled open the top left drawer as if she knew by instinct where Mrs. Pike kept her underwear . From a stack on the right she took a nylon slip and held it up to the mirror . " Oh , my , how pretty ! " she said , and tossed it in the direction of the bed . Mrs. Pike caught it in her lap and stared at it . From across the hall came the clattering sound of Simon 's walk , closer and closer . He had his boots on now . When he reached his mother 's door he walked on in without knocking and said , " I 'm ready . " Then he stood there at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward way he had and keeping his hands jammed tightly in his pockets . " What 're you ready for ? " Mrs. Hammond asked interestedly . " To be sociable at the sewing , " Simon told her . " Would you like to know what was the cause of that fight Andy Point 's mama and daddy had ? " " In a minute I would , " said Mrs. Hammond . " Right now I 'm trying to get your mother out of bed . " For the first time , Simon looked at his mother . He looked from under bunched eyebrows , sliding his eyes over slowly and carefully . But she was n't watching . He kicked at one leg of the brass bed , so that a little jingling sound rose among the springs . Then he said , " Well , I 'll be down getting me some breakfast , " and sauntered out again . Mrs. Hammond looked after him and shook her head . " Something is seriously wrong with that boy 's hair , " she told Mrs. Pike.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep on like this , Lou ? " Mrs. Pike looked down at her hands and then shook her head , as if that were her secret . " Are you sure not to stop the clocks ? " she asked , but Mrs. Hammond did n't answer . She had picked out the rest of Mrs. Pike 's underwear , and she tossed it on the bed and then reached out to pull her gently to a sitting position . " That 's it , " she said . To Joan she said , " You go along and get that boy a decent breakfast . I 'll have her down in a minute . " It did n't look to Joan as if they 'd ever be down , but she was glad to leave the room . She shut the door behind her and descended the stairs quickly , taking two steps at a time , trailing her fingers along the railing . When she reached the kitchen Simon had already taken out the makings for a peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwich . He was running his thumbnail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripples in it . " Would you like some milk coffee ? " she asked him , but he only shook his head . He stopped playing with the label and opened the jar , and Joan handed him a knife . " From now on , I 'm going on no more boats , " he said . " I take stock in dreams . " " That 's kind of silly , " said Joan . " I know when I been warned . " He slapped mayonnaise on top of peanut butter and clamped the two slices of bread together . Then he began to eat , starting with the crust and working his way around until all he had was a small crestless square with scalloped edges . When that point was reached he looked relieved , because he hated crusts . He took a bite out ofp1561what was left and began talking with his mouth full . " Instead of staying here , " he said , " I just might to on over to Billy 's house . His daddy gave him a chemistry set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say anything . " I might do that instead of staying around here talking , " he told her . " Well , suit yourself , " said Joan . " Mama 'd never notice . " " Sure , she would . " " I bet not . " Joan went over to the cupboard and took down a huge plate , a green glass one that looked like summer and river-water . She began laying out cookies and cakes on it , choosing from boxes that neighbors had brought , while Simon watched her and chewed earnestly through a mouthful of peanut butter . When Joan was finished she stepped back and looked at the cake plate with her eyes squinted a little . " Aunt Lou does it better , " she said . " Oh , I do n't know . " " She puts it in a design , sort of . " " One thing , " said Simon , " she do n't ever lay out that much . Not with just one customer , she do n't . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkly plate . " " Well , it 's too late now , " Joan said . She picked up the plate and carried it out to the parlor , where she set it on a lampstand by the couch . Then she swung her aunt 's sewing machine out into the middle of the room . It was the old kind , run by a treadle , set into a long scarred table . From one of the drawers underneath it she tookp162her aunt 's wicker spool box , and while she was doing that she heard the slow careful steps of Mrs. Pike beginningacross the upstairs hall . " That 's it , " Mrs. Hammond was saying , " that 's it . " The kitchen door swung open and Simon came out , chewing on the last of his sandwich , to stand at the foot of the stairs and gaze upward . ' Mama 's coming down , " he told Joan . " I see she is . " " First time she 's come before noon . How long have I got to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " " Well , maybe I will for a minute , " said Simon . He swung away from the stairs and went to sit on the couch , and Mrs. Pike 's feet began searching their way down the steps . " That 's it , " Mrs. Hammond kept saying . Joan pulled a chair up to the sewing machine and then stood waiting , with her face turned toward the sound of those heels . When Mrs. Pike appeared she was dressed more neatly than she had been in days . Her brown dress was freshened up with a flowered handkerchief in the pocket , and her hair was combed by someone who knew how . The only thing wrong was that she had lost some weight , and her belt , which had had its eyelets torn into long slashes from being strained across her stomach , now hung loose and stringy a good two inches below the waist of the dress . Mrs. Hammond was following close behind her to pull the belt up from in the back , so that at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again . " Does n't she look nice ? " Mrs. Hammond asked , and both Joan and Simon nodded.  |p163In  Mrs. Hammond 's other hand was the bundle of cloth and tissue paper . She escorted Mrs. Pike to the chair Joan had ready and then she set the bundle down on the sewing table beside her , saying , " There you are , " and stepping back to see what Mrs. Pike would do . Mrs. Pike did n't do anything . She looked at the lilac cloth as if she 'd never seen it before . " Well , now , " said Mrs. Hammond , and began opening out the bundle herself . " If you 'll remember , you cut this out back in May , before all that business about Laura 's wedding came up , and I have n't tried it on since . Joan honey , do you want to bring your aunt some coffee and a roll ? " " I 'm not hungry , " said Mrs. Pike . But Joan escaped to the kitchen anyway , while Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tomato diet for three weeks , " she was saying , " all in honor of this princess-style dress . So now , Lou , I want you to pin it on me again . Do n't make it an inch too big , because I want to lose five more pounds , Lord willing  --  " Joan took two cups and saucers down and set them on the tray . Then she poured out the coffee , taking her time because she was in no hurry to get back to the parlor . When the last possible thing had been seen to , she picked up the tray and carried it out . " The older you get , " Mrs. Hammond was saying , " the harder the fat clings . " She had patches of lilac pinned on over her regular dress now , but she was more or less doing it herself . Mrs. Pike just kept smoothing down the already pinned-on patches , running her fingers along the cloth with vague fumbling motions . " There 's only four pieces , " Mrs. Hammond reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You remember that 's one reason we decided on this . You could whip it up in a morning , you said . Do you remember ? " In the silence that followed the question Joan set the coffee down by the cake plate and passed the two cups over . Her aunt 's she put on the table , and Mrs. Hammond'sshe placed on the chair arm , but neither woman noticed . Mrs. Pike seemed fascinated by the little wheel on her sewing machine . Mrs. Hammond was waiting endlessly , with her hands across her breasts to keep the lilac cloth in place . She seemed to be planning to keep silent forever , if she had to , just so that one question of hers could be answered . But Mrs. Pike might not even have heard . Then Simon said , " Urn , why Andy Point 's parents wo n't speak to each other  --  " and Mrs. Hammond looked up at him . " Why they sit in their parlor in chairs faced back to back , " he said , " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Andy says . But I could n't hardly believe it , it was such a little thing that set them fight-ing . " " It 's nearly always little things , " said Mrs. Hammond . Mrs. Pike nodded and took a packet of pins out of her spool box . " They were on their way to church , see , " Simon said . " Andy was along . They made him come . When suddenly they passed this sign saying , Craig Church two miles , visitors welcome . ' Mrs. Point she said , Why , I never have seen that before . ' Just being conversational . And Mr. Point says , Well , I do n't know why not . It 's beenp165there a year or more , ' he says . No it ai n't , ' Mrs. Point says . Yes , it has , ' Mr. Point says ... " " Well , now , is n't that typical , " said Mrs. Hammond . She turned slightly , but Mrs. Pike pulled her back again to pin two pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of pins , and her eyes were frowningat everything her fingers did . " So anyway , " Simon said , " that was what began it . Andy says he never saw such a thing . He says they 've even had to order another newspaper subscription , because they would n't share the one between them . " " If that is n't the limit , " said Mrs. Hammond . " Ouch , Lou . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " said Mrs. Pike . Everyone looked toward her , but she only went on pinning and did n't say any more , so Mrs. Hammond took up where she had left off . " What does n't make sense , " she told Simon , " is Mary Point 's nature . She 's not the type to bear a grudge . " " Oh , it wo n't her fault , " said Simon . " Andy says she had forgot about it . She just went on into church and never thought a thing about it . But then at dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made himself a sandwich right after . That 's a sign he 's mad . Mrs. Point said , Andy , ' she said , I 'll be . Is your daddy mad about something ? ' And Andy said , Well , I reckon he 's mad you said that sign was n't there . ' So she said , Oh , I had forgot all about that , ' but then it was too late . Now she 's mad at him for being mad , and it do n't look like it 's ever going to end . "  | " You have n't lost a pound , " Mrs. Pike said . She had finished pinning the pieces together now , and she was shaking her head at how tightly they fit . " I have too , " said Mrs. Hammond . " You allow a good inch for the dress I 'm wearing underneath it , Lou . " She acted as if it were perfectly natural that Mrs. Pike was speaking , but right on the tail of her words she shot Joan a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel too sure of anything yet . But Simon kept on bravely , with his hands clutching the edge of the couch and his eyes on his mother , even though it was Mrs. Hammond he was speaking to . " I asked him , " he said . " I asked , Andy , how you think they 're going to end it ? ' And Andy says , Same way it started , I reckon . By accident . ' " " Well , no , " said Mrs. Pike , and once again everyone 's attention was on her alone . She removed the pins from her mouth and laid them on the sewing table , and then she said , " It 's not that easy . Why sure , one of them might speak by accident . Mary might . Then Sid might answer , being glad she 'd spoken first , but by then Mary would have caught herself . She 'd feel silly to speak first , and only snap his head off then . It 's not that easy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Joan thought she would have agreed no matter what her aunt had said . " You have to think about the  --  " The telephone rang . Mrs. Hammond stopped speaking , and Simon leaped over to pick up the receiver . " Hello ? " he said . " What ? " He was silent a minute . " No , I knew about it . I knew , I just forgot . Well , thank you anyway . Bye . " He hung up.  | " Who was that ? " asked Mrs. Hammond . " Just that station . " " What ? " " Just that radio station . They got this jackpot on . They call you up and if you do n't say , Hello , ' if you say instead , I am listening to WKKJ , the all-day swinging station  --  ' " " I 've heard about that , " Mrs. Hammond said . " If he 'd just called before , boy . It 's not me who was prepared for them to  --  " Mrs. Pike 's spool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thread went every which-way , rolling out their tails behind them , and Mrs. Hammond said , " Why , Lou , " but Mrs. Pike did n't answer . She had crumpled up against her sewing machine , leaning her forehead against the wheel of it and clenching both fists tightly against her stomach . " Lou ! " Mrs. Hammond said sharply . She looked at Joan and Simon , and they stared back . " Did something happen ? " " I said something , " Simon told her . Mrs. Hammond kept watching him , but he did n't explainany further . Finally she turned back to Mrs. Pike and said , " Sit up , Lou , " and pulled her by the shoulders , struggling against the dead weight of her . " What 's the matter ? " she asked . She looked into Mrs. Pike 's face , at her dry wide eyes and the white mark that the sewingmachinewheel had made down the center of her forehead . " What 's the matter ? " she asked again . But Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan stared at the floor.  |p168ALL  TUESDAY MORNING , Ansel had visitors . The firstone was Joan . She must n't have stayed long because she came and went while James was emptying the garbage , which only took a minute . When he returned Ansel said , " Joan 's been here , " and then dumped a cupped handful of sunflower hulls into an ashtray and sat down to read the paper . " What 'd she want ? " James asked . " Oh , nothing , " said Ansel . He opened the paper out and stayed hidden behind it , with just one tuft of pale hair on the top of his head exposed to view . " You wo n't have to work tobacco today , " he added as an afterthought . " How 's that ? " But Ansel did n't answer . Ever since he had awakened he had been angry ; James could tell by his long silences , but he knew there was no point asking what was wrong . So he went on fixing breakfast , and while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say her uncle was working today . He flipped over a fried egg that was burning and called , " Ansel ? " " Hmmm . " " Is Roy Pike working today ? " But that was another question he never got to answer to . All he heard was the steady thumping of Ansel 's foot ( Ansel kept time to everything he read , as if it were a poem ) and the crackling of newspaper pages . He did n't try asking again . The second visitor was Maisie Hammond . She came while Ansel was eating breakfast off the Japanese tray , and when she walked in Ansel said , " Urn . Maisie , " and went on munching on his fried egg . ( It was one of those days when James had brought a tray without being asked , simply because it was more comfortable to eat in the kitchen alone . Ansel had said , " Well . I see you 've taken up cooking again , " which had n't even made sense . ) Maisie was wearing a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his couch like Florence Nightingale and bent down to inspect Ansel 's egg . " What 's that ? " she asked . " Fried egg , of course . " " It looks kind of funny . " " It 's James 's , " said Ansel . " Ah . " And she turned around , so that now she could see James where he sat eating in the kitchen . " Hey , James , " she said . " Hello , Maisie . " " Taken any pictures lately ? " " No. "  |p170That  seemed to end the conversation ; she turned back to Ansel . " You mind if I sit on your couch ? " she asked . " I 'd prefer the armchair . " " Well . " She settled on the very edge of the armchair , spreadingher skirt around her . When she bent her head toward Ansel , with the tow-white hair falling over her face , the morning sun seemed to pass right through her hair . She looked like glass . James studied her through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't look his way again . " I came to ask you to a picnic , " she told Ansel . " Oh , no . Thank you anyway . " " Aunt Connie 's giving it . " " Well , it 's nice of you to ask , " Ansel said . " Do n't you want to come ? " " Oh , I ca n't . James , I 'm through with my tray . " " Put it on the table , " said James . " There 's too much other stuff there . " James scraped his chair back and went to the living room , still chewing his piece of toast . By the time he reached the couch , Ansel was already preparing to lie down ; he held the tray out in one hand , while he swung his feet up onto the couch . " Ansel wo n't come to Aunt Connie 's picnic , " Maisie said . " That 's too bad , " said James . He picked the tray up and went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , " Maisie called after him.  | " Maybe he do n't feel up to it . " " Will you hush ? " Ansel asked . " I 'm not giving any excuses ; why should you ? " " Sorry . " James made another trip back for the salt and pepper , which were sitting on the arm of the sofa . As he bent to pick them up , Maisie said , " Will you talk to him ? " " Nothing I can say . " " Why does n't he ever go places ? " " That 's my secret , " Ansel said . They looked at him . He was lying on his back , with his hands crossed over his chest as if he expected to be laid out any minute , and his eyes were staring upwards , wide and blank . But now that he had their attention , all he did was switch his eyes suddenly to the window overhead and say , " Well , now . Yonder goes a jet . " They both waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said finally . " Are you in some pain ? " Maisie asked . " Well , yes . " She looked across at James . " Ansel 's in pain , " she told him . But James just sat down on a wooden chair , still holding the salt and pepper , and stretched his legs out comfortably in front of him . If Ansel began an answer by saying , " Well , " there was no use believing him . " What shall I do ? " Maisie asked him . " I do n't know . " " Get him a hot water bottle ? " " Hot water bottle on my feet wo n't help , " said Ansel . " Oh . Is it your feet that hurt ? "  | " I think it is . " " I declare , " said Maisie , and then looked at James again , but he did n't offer any suggestions . Finally she said , " Is that why you wo n't come to the picnic ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd be all better by then . " " I just do n't want to come , " Ansel said . " But thank you anyway . " Maisie could n't seem to find anything to say to that . She sat there , twisting at the hem of her white skirt , and James began hitting the plastic salt and pepper shakers together until he had worked up to a good rhythm . He was considering starting some more complicated beat when Maisie said , " Will you stop that noise ? " James stopped . Outside a car suddenly drove up , making a great racket as it skidded to a stop on the gravel road . Maisie stood up and bent forward a little to peer out the window . " It 's Aunt Connie , " she said . " Maybe she 's come to invite me personally , " said Ansel . " No , she 's going toward Mrs. Pike 's . " " She wo n't stay there long . Mrs. Pike wants to be by herself . " " Aunt Connie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm very cheering , but you know what happened when I  --  " " It 's Aunt Connie 's biggest party of the summer I 'm asking you to , " Maisie told him . " That 's all . The one where she hires the magician and all . " Ansel sighed and looked at the ceiling . After a minutep173he said , " The actual place it hurts is right behind the anklebones . The pain is awful . " " The anklebones ? " " Last night I walked too much . " " Where 'd you walk to ? " Maisie asked . James frowned at Ansel . He did n't want Maisie to hear about last night , not after that scolding she 'd given him . But Ansel was n't looking at James ; he went on , placidly . " I walked just about everywhere , " he said . " I thought , I got to get out of here . This is no place for me . ' I went everywhere I could think of . " " You should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have no idea how dizzy I was , " Ansel told her . " How swimming in the head I was . I could n't even pack my things . I had to have a little something first to steady my nerves . " " To  --  oh , " Maisie said , and she shot a glance over at James and narrowed her eyes . " Ansel , you know what happens . If you get to drinking , you see how you feel . " " It was my mood , " said Ansel . " I started walking . " James sat forward and said , " There 's a pitcher of Kool-Aid in the icebox . Anybody want some ? " " No , " Maisie said . " Where were you when all this was going on ? " " I was working , " said James . He stood up , before she had a chance to say any more . " I 've got to go see Dan at the paper . Take him those pictures . " " Well , goodbye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was relieved she had let him go that easily . In the darkroom he got his pictures together  --  one fire , one family reunion , two ladies ' meetings  --  for this week 's paper . Then while he was hunting for a manila envelope he heard a knock on the door . He straightened up and listened ( it might be Joan again ) but it was only the Potter sisters , dropping in for their biweekly visit to see how Ansel was . He heard their little chirping voices , with Maisie 's voice running flatly behind them . " We brought some Jewish grandmother cookies , the kind you like , " Miss Lucy said , and Ansel said , " Why , that 's real  --  " " I 'll take them , " Maisie said . Maisie was always butting in , James thought . He set down his pictures and came out to the living room , just to say hello , and saw that both the Potter sisters were still standing in the doorway while Maisie sat back in her easy chair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you sit down ? " he asked them , and then the chirping sounds began all over again , and the sisters came toward him with their hands outstretched . They had on those dressy white gloves of theirs with the ruffles around the wrists . Seeing that made him sad  --  they looked as if they were expecting so much out of the visit , when all they were going to do was sit on the threadbare plush chairs a minute and then go home again . He said , " It 's good to see you , Miss Lucy . Miss Faye . Nice of you to bring the cookies . " " We like doing it , " said Miss Lucy . " Will you have a seat ? " Miss Faye took the chair he pointed out to her , but Miss Lucy chose to sit by Ansel on his couch . He did n't object . He was sitting upright now , and when she settledp175down next to him he only smiled at her . " I heard you tapping those walls last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Maisie . Miss Lucy looked very severe suddenly and tucked her head further inside her high collar . She never mentionedher nightwalking during the daytime . " We came to see if you 're well , " her sister said , " and to remind you that tomorrow 's Wednesday . Time for your shots . " " James already told me , " Ansel said . " Last time you forgot anyway . You went visiting . " " That 's true , I did , " said Ansel , and then he sat back and smiled around the room , looking so happy and pleased with himself that everyone else smiled back . The Potters made little ducking smiles down at their gloved hands , and Maisie smiled with narrow eyes straight into Ansel 's face . James stood up ; now that people were seated and comfortable he could go . " I have to see Dan Thompson at the paper , " he told the Potters . " Sorry to run off . " " Well , now , have a good time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that announcement about our niece 's baby ? " " I sure will . See you later . " He went back to the darkroom . Here it was cool and distant-feeling ; the voices in the living room were faded . He put the week 's pictures in the envelope and then , to prolong his stay in the coolness , he set that down and began filing away the pictures that Ansel had been looking at a couple of days before  --  the Model A , Ansel on his couch , Joan in the dust storm . When he came to the picture of Joan he stopped and studied it ; he thought itp176might be the best thing he had ever done . Her figure made a straight , black line through a circle of wavery blurs , and her head was bent forward in that way she had when she walked . He did n't know how many hundreds of times he had seen her like that . And facing that photograph head-on , having a tangible picture of the way he saw her in his mind , made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this morning , he had been trying not to . It seemed to him , now that he stopped to consider , that if he wanted things to be smoothed over again it would have to be he who took the first step . Joan would n't . She would never change her mind about Ansel or even pretend to , in order to make things easier . He would have to go over and say , " Well , however we feel , I 'm sorry that fight happened , " or else she would just stay quietly in her own house , playing games with Simon and occupying herself with little private chores until she died . And all over nothing . He tucked her picture back into the file . Mr. Pike was always saying , " Someday , boy , that girl is going to walk off and leave you , " and he did n't know how right he was . Last month Joan had packed her things and gone downtown to catch a bus for home , but then she had decided she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the movie was over she had changed her mind and come home again , dragging two big suitcases behind her and hobbling along on her dressupshoes . She had told James about it , laughing at herself as she told it , but James had n't laughed with her . If she were to go , what would he decide to do about it ? Out in the living room , he could hear Miss Lucy dis/cussing her nephew , who was a missionary in Japan and a great curiosity there because of his red hair . " You ought to see him bow , " she said . " They bow all the time , he tells me . . . " James half-listened , drumming his fingers on the steel file drawer . If Joan were to go , he had only two choices . That was the way he saw it . He could let her be , and spend the next forty years remembering nothing but the way she used to walk across the fields with him from the tobacco barns and the peppermint smell of her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go after her and say , " Come back . And will you marry me ? " In his mind he could say that , but not in real life . In real life he had Ansel , and would have him always because he could n't walk out on that one , final member of his family that he had n't yet deserted . And in real life , he could never make Joan and Ansel like each other . " I 'll take Africa any day , " Miss Faye was saying . " Africans know they need a missionary , but these Easternersare eternally surprised . " And Miss Lucy chirped something at the end , but James could n't hear what she said . He stood up and rubbed his knees where they ached from being bent so long . Then he picked up the pictures for the paper and left the darkroom . Instead of going out through the front he crossed to the back door , in order to make his escape as quickly as possible . Outside , his eyes searched out those daisies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and about to be too old . He tucked the pictures under his arm and went deeper into the field , heading toward the tallest ones . It always madep178him feel silly , picking flowers . He did n't mind doing it ( Joan liked daisies far better than bought flowers , or any other kind of present ) , but he did n't like thinking that anyone might be watching . In case someone was , he picked very offhandedly  --  yanking the daisies up nearly by their roots , jumbling them together helter-skelter without looking at them . But while he was rounding the side of the house and heading toward the front yard he arranged them more carefully , and held them up to see if they were all right . Mrs. Hammond 's car was gone ; that was one good thing . She must have left while he was in the darkroom . Now all he wanted was for Joan to be the one to answer the door . He knocked and waited , frowning tensely at the screen . For a long time nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan called , " Was that a knock ? " Her voice echoed ; she must have been standing at the head of the stairs . " It 's me , " James said . " Simon , will you let James in ? " Simon came out of the kitchen , dragging his feet . Through the screen , all James saw of him was his silhouette  --  his spidery arms and legs , his shoulders hunched up as if he were scared of something . Before he reached the door he stopped and said , " You come by yourself ? " " Who would I be bringing ? " asked James . " Oh , no one . " And he came the rest of the way to the door and pushed it open . " Joan 's upstairs , " he said , " putting Mama to bed . She 'll be down . "  | " Your mother got up already ? " " Well , but now she 's going back to bed . I said everythingall wrong . " " I 'll bet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what he was talking about . He closed the door very softly behind him and went over to a chair . " Is Joan too busy to talk ? " But just then they heard Joan coming downstairs , walking on tiptoe and taking only one step at a time where usually she took two . Simon jerked his thumb toward the sound . " Here she is , " he said . When Joan came into view she looked at James blankly a minute , as if she 'd forgotten he was here , and then she smiled and said , " Oh . Hello . " " Hello , " James said . He stood up and held out the flowers . " I brought you some daisies . I was walking through the field and happened to come across them . " " That was nice , " she said , and then frowned at the daisies . James looked at them . They seemed old and draggled now , in a messy little cluster in his hand . " They 're not all that special , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of her thoughts . " I think they 're fine , " she said . " I 'll get a vase . " " Oh , you do n't have to get a vase for them  --  " " Well , of course I do . " She went out into the kitchen , still seeming to walk on tiptoe . Now that James thought of it , there was an uneasysilence about this house . He could n't tell if it was because of something to do with Mrs. Pike or because Joan was still mad at him , and he did n't know how top180ask . He looked across at Simon , who was still standing and staring into space . " Did I come at a bad time ? " James asked him . " Huh ? " Joan came back , carrying a cut-glass vase full of water . He asked her , " Did I come at a bad time ? " " Oh , not really . " " Well , did I or did n't I ? " " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel well this morning , but she 's upstairs now and everything'sall right . " She took the daisies from him . Her hands when they brushed his were cool and impersonal , and she did n't look at him . " We have to go gradually , " she said . " I keep forgetting that . I do n't seem to have a light touch with anything . " Yet her fingers when she arrangedthe flowers were as light and gentle as butterflies , and the daisies stood up or bent gracefully over the minute she touched them . When she was done they had stopped looking draggled ; James was glad now that he had brought them . " You ought to work for a florist , " he told her . But she set the vase down on a table without even noticing how they looked . She had n't glanced at them once , all the time she was arranging them . " Mrs. Hammonddoes , " she said . " Have a light touch , I mean . But I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't know that I follow you , " James said . She shook her head and sat down , as if she had given up on him . " Never mind , " she said . " Mrs. Hammond has a light touch ? "  | " Never mind . " She looked suddenly at Simon . " Simon , do you want lunch ? " she asked him . " I just had breakfast . " " Oh . " " You have a light touch , " James said . " You have the lightest touch of anyone I know . " " Oh , James , you do n't know . " " Well , I 'm trying  --  " He stopped and glanced toward Simon . It seemed to him Simon looked cold . " Do n't you want to sit down ? " he asked . " I 'm okay . " " Come on . " Simon shrugged and sat down on the couch . Now that they were all seated here , facing each other and keeping their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . It seemed they should be having a conversation of some kind , something that made sense . Not these little jagged bits of words . He tried smiling at Joan but all she did was smile back , using only her mouth while her eyes stayed serious and maybe even angry ; he did n't know . " Would you rather I come back another time ? " he asked . " It 's all right . " " Well . " He sat further forward and looked at his fingernails . " I guess your uncle 's working today , " he said . " Did n't Ansel tell you so ? " " In a way he did . " " There 's nothing bad about it , " said Joan . " Why , no , of course not . " " You have to do something . You ca n't sit around . It 's not fair to sit around , reminding people all the time  --  "  |p182She  stopped , and James looked sideways at her while he kept his head bent over his fingernails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did n't know what he was supposed to say to her . But then she said , " Well . So you do n't have to work tobacco any more . " " No , " James said . " That 's good . " He waited a minute , and then cleared his throat and said , " It 'll be a good season , they say . " " Billy Brandon told me that , " Simon said suddenly . " Barns are nearly full already . " In his shirt pocket he found a plastic comb , with little pieces of lint sticking to it . By running his index finger across its teeth he made a sound like a tiny xylophone , flat and tinny . Joan and Simon both sat watching him . When he saw them watching he stopped and put the comb back in his pocket . " I guess I 'll be going , " he said helplessly . " I could come some other time . " " All right , " said Joan . " Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he still was n't sure . He stood up and went over to the door , with Joan and Simon following solemnly behind . Then he turned around and said , " I could take you to the movies , maybe , Thursday night . The two of you . " " We 'll see , " Joan said . " Do you want to come or do n't you ? " " I do n't know yet if we can , " she said.  | " Well , I would n't ask so far in advance , but tomorrow night I ca n't go . I 'm going to take Ansel playing cribbage . But Thursday  --  " " We 'll see , " said Joan . " I know I was n't going to chauffeur him around no more , but lately he 's been  --  Well . We do n't have to go into that . " " I 'm not going into anything , " Joan said . " Yes , you are . " " I was n't saying a word . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was n't looking any way . I was n't even thinking about it . " She sounded near tears . James stood there , trying to think of what to say next , but he figured anything he came up with would only make things worse . So he waited a minute , and then he said , " I think I 'd better leave . Goodbye . " " Goodbye , " Simon said . He was down the porch steps and halfway across the yard when he heard their door close ; Joan had never said goodbye . The only sounds now were from Ansel 's window  --  the birdlike sounds of women laughing , all clustered around his brother , their laughter pealing out in clear happy trills that drifted through the window and hung like a curtain across the empty porch.  |p184THAT  AFTERNOON , Joan had a telephone call from her mother . She was upstairs when it came , getting Mrs. Pike out of bed for the second time and finding it a little easier now than it had been in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , and her aunt actually answered , with only a slight pause beforehand . " The beige , I guess , " she said . She waited while Joan lifted it off the hanger . " Can I wear the abalone pin with that ? " " Of course , " Joan said . She would have agreed if her aunt had wanted to wear the kitchen curtains . She picked the pin out of the bureau drawer and laid it besidethe dress , and then the phone rang . Both of them stopped to listen . " Hey , Joan ! " Simon called . " I 'm up here . " " Someone wants you on the telephone . " " Well , I 'll be back , " Joan told her aunt , and she wentp185down the stairs very fast , two steps at a time . She did n't know who she was expecting , but when she heard only the ice-cold , nasal voice of the operator she was disappointed . " Miss Joan Pike ? " the operator asked . " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Long distance calling . " " All right , " Joan said . There was a pause , and then her mother said , " Is that Joan ? " , formally , and waited for Joan to go through the whole business of identifying herself again . " It 's me , " said Joan . " Hello , Mother . " " Hello , " her mother said . " I called to see how Lou was . Your father said to ask . " " She 's getting better , " said Joan . She heard her mother turn and murmur to her father , probably relayingJoan 's answer . In normal speech her mother had a very soft voice , held in as if there were somebody sick in the next room . But when she returned to the phone her tea-party voice came back , louder and more distinct , the voice of a plump woman who stood very straight and placed the points of her shoes outward when she walked . " Your father feels bad we could n't make it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's only a sniffle he has , but I do n't like the sound of it . Is there anything we can do for Lou ? " " Not that I can think of . The flowers were very nice  --  Uncle Roy said to tell you . "  | " Well . We were n't quite sure . Some people have a dislike of gladioli . " " No , they were fine , " said Joan . " That 's good . How 's Simon ? " " He 's all right , I guess . " " Tell him hello for us , now . Tell him  --  " Her voice had grown almost as soft as it normally was . Joan could picture her , sitting on the edge of that rocker with the needlework seat , with Joan 's father standing behind her and bending cautiously forward to bear what was going on . He was a little afraid of telephoneshimself ; he treated them as though they might explode . She saw how her mother would be smoothing down that little crease between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crease come back the minute she dropped her hand . The thought of that made Joan miss her ; she said suddenly , " I 'm tired . " " What ? " " I 'm just tired . I want to come home . I do n't want to stay here any more . " " Why , Joan  --  " her mother said , and then let her voice trail off . Finally she said , " Do n't you think you should be with Lou now ? " " I 'm not helping , " said Joan . " She just sits . Every place I look , Janie Rose is there , and I do n't feel like staying here . Nothing is right . " " Does n't Simon need you ? " " Well  --  " Joan said , and then stopped because her father must have asked to know what was going on . The two of them murmured together a while , her mother 's voice sounding faintly impatient . Joan 's father was grow/ing deaf ; he had to be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sighing , and her voice was loud again . " You know we 'd love to have you , " she said . " As soon as you can come . When were you planning on ? " " I do n't know . A day or two , maybe . By bus . " " Or maybe James could drive you , " said her mother . " We 'd love to have him . " " He wo n't be coming . " " Your father 's been asking about him . " " He wo n't be coming , " Joan said firmly . There was another pause , and then her mother said , " Is something wrong ? " " What would be wrong ? " " Well , I do n't know . Shall we expect you when we see you , then ? " " All right . Do n't go to any trouble . " " It 'll be no trouble . Goodbye , now . " " Goodbye . And thank you for calling . " She hung up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver . Out of the corner of her eye she caught sight of Simon . He was leaning against the frame of the kitchen door , eating another peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwich . " Hey , " she said , but he only bit off a hunk of sandwich and chewed steadily , keeping his eyes on her face . " That was your Aunt Abby , " she told him . " I know . " " She called to see how everyone is . " He straightened up from the doorframe and came over to her , planting his feet very carefully and straightp188in front of him . When he had reached her he said , " I hear how you 're going there , " and waited , with the sandwichraised halfway to his mouth . " We 'll see , " said Joan . " You going by bus ? " " I might not go at all . I do n't know yet . " " How long would you go for ? " " Look , " said Joan . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be good to get away . So do n't tell anyone , all right ? " " Well , all right . " " Not even James . " " All right , " said Simon . He was good at keeping secrets ; it was an insult to suggest he might tell somebody . " If you do go  --  " he said . " I might not . " " But if you do go , can I go with you ? " " Oh , Simon , " Joan began , and stopped there because she did n't know what else to say . " Your parents need you here , " she said finally . " They wo n't notice . " " Your daddy will . So will your mother , pretty soon . " " No . " " Yes . See , she 's coming downstairs now . " He turned and looked toward the stairs . Mrs. Pike was coming down of her own accord , taking each step uncertainlybut not asking for help . She had pinned the abalonepin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the material a little . When she reached the bottom of the stairs she looked from Joan to Simon and back again , asp189if she were expecting them to tell her what to do next . Joan went over to her . " I could fix you a bite to eat , " she said . " I came to sew . " " To sew ? " " I came to sew Connie 's dress together . " " Oh , " Joan said . She looked around at the sewing machine , and was glad to see that the dress still lay there . ( Mrs. Hammond had gone away all helter-skelter , talking to herself , leaving everything behind her . ) " It 's all here , " Joan told her . " Is there anything else you need ? " " No . I just want to sew . " " Shall we sit here and keep you company ? " " I just want to sew . " " All right , " said Joan , but she waited a minute anyway , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She went over to the chair at the sewing machine and lowered herself stiffly into it , and then she picked up the material and began sewing on it . She did it just that suddenly , without examining what she was about to do first or even looking at it  --  just jammed two pieces of cloth beneath the needle of the sewing machine and stepped hard on the treadle . Finally Joan turned away , because there was nothing more she could do . " Let 's go to the kitchen , " she told Simon . She steered him gently by one shoulder and he went , but he kept looking back over his shoulder at his mother . When they reached the kitchen he said , " See ? " but she said , " Hush , " without even asking what he meant . " Maybe we could go for a walk , " she said.  | " I found my ball . " " What ball ? " " That one I lost . I found it . " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is it all beatup ? " " It 's fine . You want to play catch ? " " Not really . " " Aw , come on , Joan . " She frowned at him . " We should have taken you to a barber , " she said finally . " Just for fifteen minutes or so ? I wo n't throw hard . " " Oh , all right , " she said . Simon went over to the door and picked up the baseballthat lay beside it . It was grayer than before , and grass-stained , but lying out in the field for two weeks had n't hurt it any . He began throwing it up in the air and catching it , while he led the way through the kitchen and out the back door . " If we had a big mowed lawn , we could play roll-abat , " Joan said . " Roll-a-bat 's a baby game . " They cut through the tall grass behind the house , partingthe weeds ahead of them with swimming motions and advancing beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass was shorter . Janie Rose had set fire to this spot not a year ago , while trailing through here in her mother 's treasured wedding dress and holding a lighted cigarette high in front of her with her little finger stuck out . James and Mr. Pike and Mr. Terry had had to fight the fire with their own shirts , their faces glistening with sweat and their voices hoarse fromp191smoke , while Ansel leaned out the back window calling " Shame ! Shame ! " and Janie Rose sat perched in the tin can tree , crying and cleaning her glasses with the lace hem of the wedding dress . Now the weeds had grown up again , but they were shorter and sparser , with black scorched earth showing around them . Joan and Simon took up their positions , one at each end of the burned patch , and Simon scraped a standing-place for himself by kicking down the brittle weeds and scuffing at the charred surface of the soil . " Here goes , " he said , and wound up his arm so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward it off before he had even let go of the ball . Simon stopped winding up and pounded the ball into the palm of his other hand . " Hey , now , " he said . " You going to play like a girl ? " " Not if you throw easy like you promised . " He squinted across at her a minute , and then nodded and raised his throwing arm again . This time the ball came without any windup , cutting in a straight clean arc through the blue of the sky . Joan caught it neatly , rememberingnot to close her eyes , and threw it back to him underhanded . " Overhand , " said Simon . " Sorry . " Little prickles of sweat came out on her forehead . She tugged her blouse out of her bermudas , so as to make herself cooler , and almost missed the next ball when it whizzed low and straight toward her stomach . " Watch it , " Simon said . " You watch it . That one burned my hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little short , so that Simon had to run forward to catch it . While he was walking back to his place a screen door slammed behind them , and Joan automatically turned her head and listened to find out what end of the house it had come from . " Coming , " said Simon , and just then Joan saw , in the corner of her eye , someone tall in James 's plaid shirt , untangling his way through the field and toward Joan . She turned all the way . " Watch  --  ! " Simon said , and something slammed into the side of her head and made everything green and smarting . She sat down , not because she had been knocked down but because she was so startled her knees were weak . Beside her , nestled in a clump of grass , was the baseball , lookingwhiter than she remembered . Her temple began throbbing and she lay all the way down on her back , with the scorched ground underneath her making little crisp brittle sounds . " Joan ! " Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thudding closer and closer . It was Ansel . She saw that and closed her eyes . In the same moment Simon arrived , with his breath coming fast and loud . He thumped down beside her and said , " Joan , oh , shit , Joan , " which made her suddenly grin , even with her eyes closed and her head aching . She looked up at him and said , " Simon Pike  --  " and tried to sit up , but someone yanked her back by the shoulders . " Where did you  --  " she began , but then Ansel clapped his hand over her mouth . His hand smelled of Noxzeina . " You lie still , " he said . " Do n't you sit and do n't you talk . I 'll call a ambulance . " " An ambulance ? " And this time she out and outp193laughed , and sat up even with Ansel trying to press her back down again . " Ansel , " she said , " I really do n't need an ambulance . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Simon said . " Oh , Lord , people break so easy . " He settled back on his haunches , clutching his knees , and for a minute it looked as if he would cry . " Oh , hey , now , " Joan told him . She struggled all the way up , letting Ansel keep hold of one of her elbows , and then reached down to give Simon a hand up . When she stood her head hurt more ; it was throbbing . She patted Simon 's shoulder . " It was my doing , " she said . " I turned to see who was coming . " Ansel kept hanging on to her elbow , too tightly . She tried to pull away but he only tightened his grasp and bent closer over her , looking long and pale and worried with his light eyes blinking anxiously in the strong sunlight . " You 're coming inside , " he told her . " I 'll call a doctor . " " I do n't need a doctor , Ansel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heaven 's sake , " she said . " I 'm not about to die on you . " " You never know . You never can  --  " She pulled away from him , this time so hard that he had to let her go , and reached out for Simon 's hand instead , in case she got dizzier . Simon accepted her hand like a grave responsibility and led her , soberly and silently , toward the house . Ansel followed , panting from all this unexpected exercise . " We 'll go to my house , " he said , " where I have iced tea . "  | " No , thank you . " " I want you to go to my house . I feel responsible . And anyway , I 'm lonely . James has gone off to Dan Thomp-son 's . " " Oh , all right , " Joan said . It was true that she did n't want to go back to that parlor again . They veered toward the Greens ' end of the house , with Ansel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusted car parts so that Joan could have a clear passage . When they reached the back door he held it open for them and ushered them in with a bow , though neither Simon or Joan paid any attention to him . " Head on to the front room , " he said . " I 'll tell you what , Joan : you can lie on my couch . " " Oh , well , Ansel , I do n't need  --  " " It 's not often I let someone do that . " " All right , " she said , and went on toward the couch , feeling too aching to argue . The house smelled like James  --  a mixture of darkroom chemicals and shaving soap and sunshine  --  and there was a little of that medicinesmell of Ansel 's there too . She lay back on the couch and closed her eyes . Ansel brought iced tea , with the ice cubes tinkling in the glasses and a sprig of fresh mint floating on top . It surprised her , because Ansel was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't even know where the glasses were . He set the tray down on the coffee table and handed a glass to both Simon and Joan . Then he picked up his own glass and carried it over to the easy chair , where he sat down a little uncertainly , as if he had never sat there before . Maybe he hadn't.  | " Cheers , " he said , and held his glass up high . " In reference to this doctor business , Joan  --  " " I feel fine . " " But maybe you should see one anyway , " said Simon . " You just do n't know what might have happened . " " Nothing happened . Will you hush ? " She took a sip of iced tea and closed her eyes . It felt good to be cool again . The room was dim and quiet , and the couch was comfortable , and the heat of outdoors had made her feel relaxed and sleepy . " What else is good , " Ansel was telling Simon , " is to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried that ? " His voice was far away and faint , because Joan was half-asleep . She heard him shift his position in the creaky old chair . " You ever tried it ? " he asked again . " No , " said Simon . He was still being cautious with Ansel , although Joan could n't figure out why . " You ought to have your mother make it for you , " Ansel told him . " She wo n't care . " " Sure she will . Sure she will . " " We drink mainly Cokes , " said Simon . " This is better . " There was a long silence . Joan reached over to set her glass on the floor , and then she lay down again and put the back of her hand across her eyes to shut the light out . " James is at Dan Thompson 's , " Ansel said . " You told me that , " said Simon . " He just walked out and left me here , alone . "  | " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll forget what name to put on the headstone . " " I do n't care . " " Ah , well , " Ansel sighed , and there was the sound of his stretching in the chair . " There is a collection , in this world , " he said , " of people who could die and be mourned approximately a week . If they 're lucky . Then that 's the end of it . You think I 'm one ? " " I do n't know , " said Simon . " I 'm not listening . " " Oh . " There was another pause , and someone 's ice tinkled . Ansel 's , probably . Ansel said , " I 'm going to go away from here . " " Everyone is , " said Simon . " What ? " " Grown-ups can go and not even let on they 're going . I wish I could . " " You can come with me , " Ansel said . " Where 's that ? " " This town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it north ? " Simon asked . " North of what ? " " North north . Is it ? " " It 's south , " said Ansel . " Oh . I want to go north . " " It 's all the same . Who you kidding ? This town has got a cop that acts like a night watchman . He goes through the town on foggy nights crying out the hours , singing Sunshine on the Mountain ' and all other sunnyp197songs , middle of the night . Ai n't that a thing to wake in the night to , boy . " " Yeah , " said Simon . " To wake up after a nightmare to . " " Yeah . " The throbbing in Joan 's head kept time to Ansel 's words . She wanted to leave now , and stop listening to that thin voice of his going on and on , but the throbbing made a weight on her head that kept her down . She listened dreamily , without interrupting . " Lately I 've been thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral that did it , somehow . " " You did n't go to the funeral . " " It did it anyway . The only problem is , it 's hard to know what way to think about it . No telling how it 's changed , and I get no letters from there . James does , from our sisters . He writes them once a month , letters all full of facts , but when he gets an answer he pretends he does n't . I do n't know why . I mean he goes on writing but never mentions what their letters to him have said , never comments on them . Why do you think he does that ? " " I do n't know , " Simon said . " This cop , does he sing every night ? " " Just about . And there 's a feed store that gives away free hats . Big straw hats , with red plumes curling down like Sir Walter Raleigh 's . Walk down Sedad Street and it 's just an acre of people wearing hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farmers wearing hats , everyone but little old ladies wearing hats . Old ladies do n't like them hats . You go down to Harper'sp198River and find little boys and colored men fishing in leaky boats , wearing red-plumed hats . Why , you can tell when you 're coming home again . You look out the bus window into those country fields and find farmers plowing , wearing hats with red plumes , and the mules wearingthem too but with holes cut in them for the ears to stick out . That 's how you know you 're nearing home . " " How about me ? " asked Simon . " How about you . " " If I was to ask , would they give me one too ? " " Why , surely . " " I 'll ask , then . " " You do that . " More ice tinkled . Joan 's hand had stuck to her damp forehead and she took it away , making a tearing sound , and sighed and turned over on her side . " What exactly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caraway , N.C. " " Is there buses to it ? " " Six a day . " " Is there people my age ? " " Is there ? " Ansel asked , and he laughed suddenly , a chuckle deep in his throat so that he sounded a little like James . " Is there , boy . Well , lots . I ought to know . Anotherthing . This is something I 've never seen in any other town , now : the boys wear one gold ring in their ear . " " Earrings ? " " Oh , no . No , this ' is like pirates wear . Pierce their ears and put one gold hoop through . Everyone did it . "  | " Did you ? " " My family did n't want me to . Well , I was n't actually in that particular group , anyway . But James was . He had a hoop , but he took it off finally . Only got one because the family told him not to . Eventually everyone takes them off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll hear someone say , So-and-so 's engaged now . He 's got a steady job , and there 's no more gold in his ear . ' But I never had gold in my ear to begin with . " " Does it hurt ? " Simon asked . " Does what hurt ? " " When they pierce your ears . " " Oh , no . At least , I do n't think so . Not for long . " " If I went there , would I wear a earring ? " " Sure you would . " " How long is it by bus ? " Joan felt herself drifting off . The house seemed to be spinning around her , making streaky yellow shimmers of sunshine through her eyelids , but when she found that she was n't even hearing the others ' voices now she pulled herself sharply awake . She opened her eyes and found that she was looking at one of Ansel 's shoes , tapping lazily on the floor . " Have I been asleep ? " she asked . Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " " Not yet three , " said Ansel . " How 's your head ? " " It 's fine . " " You sure ? " " Yes . Sorry to disappoint you . " She sat up and tuckedher blouse in . " Simon , we got to get going , " she said . " Aw , I was just hearing something interesting . " " It can wait . "  |p200She  let him go through the front door first , and then she turned to Ansel and smiled at him . " Thank you for the use of the couch , " she said . " Nothing to it . " He poked his head out the door , past Joan , and looked at Simon . " You be making your plans , now , " he said . " All right . " " Plans for what ? " Joan asked . " Nothing , " said Simon . Joan yawned , and followed him down the porch toward home.  | " THERE 'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE between one personand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be true . Would you agree with me ? " He raised himself up from a prone position on the couch to look at James , who was sitting nearby with the paper . " Would you ? " he asked . " Well , more or less , " said James , and turned to the sports section . " Course you do . You have to . Is that the Larksville paper ? " " Larksville paper 's not out till tomorrow . " " Oh . I thought today was Wednesday . " " It is , " said James . " The paper comes on Thursday . " " Oh . " Ansel lay down again and stared thoughtfully upwards , lacing his fingers across his chest . He had been flat on his back all morning , complaining of dizzy spells , and James had been sitting here keeping him company . It was easier that way . Otherwise Ansel would contin/ually think up reasons to call him into the room and things to ask him for . " James , " he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who gave sermons on the street corner ? " Or , " Whatever happened to that seersuckersuit I used to have ? " And in the long run James would have to spend just as much time in this room as if he 'd been sitting there all along . He yawned now and turned another page of his newspaper , and Ansel switched his eyes back over to him . " It 's a fact , James , " he said . " People do n't vary a heck of a lot , one from the other . " " You told me that , " said James . " Well , yes , I did . Because it 's true . If you will hark your mind back to that Edwards boy , that bucktoothed one that joined the Army  --  what was his name ? " " I do n't know . " " Oh , sure you know . Sure you know . ' What was his name ? " " Ansel , " said James , " I just do n't make a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't brag about it . Clarence , that was it . Or Clayton ; I do n't know which . Now , Clarence , he went almost around the world with that Army outfit of his . Almost everywhere . And you know what he said when he got back ? He said that every single country he 'd been in , one thing always held true : when mothers and children climb into a car to go visiting , the first act a mother undertakes is spitting on a hanky and scrubbing her children 's faces with it . Always . Canada , France , Germany  --  always . If that does n't prove my point , what does ? " James ran his eyes down the baseball scores . Hep203frowned over them , absentmindedly making a little tch sound under his breath when he came upon a score he did n't like . After a while he became aware of the silence , and he looked up to see Ansel watching him with his eyes wide and hurt . " You were n't even listening , " Ansel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was listening and reading both , " he said . " No . What 's it take to make a man listen ? " " Well , I 'm sorry . You can tell it to me over again , if you want . " " No . " Ansel turned slightly , so that his cheek was resting on the sofa cushion , and closed his eyes . " I 've noticed more and more , " he said , " that no one listens when I talk . I do n't know why . Usually I think about a thing before I say it , making sure it 's worthwhile . I plan it in my mind , like . When I am dead , what will they remember but the things I talked about ? Not the way I looked , or moved ; I did n't look like much and I hardly moved at all . But only the things I talked about , and what is that to remember when you never even listened ? " " I listen , " said James . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I 've said something , when no one 's saying anything back because they did n't hear me , I look at myself and think , well , my goodness . Am I here ? Do I even exist ? " " ph , for heaven 's sake , " said James . He opened the paper again . " When I am dead , I wonder what people will miss me . You ? Simon ? Mrs. Pike will wish she 'd brought more hot soup . Joan wo n't notice I 'm gone . Will you miss me ? "  |p204James  read on . He learned all about a boy named Ralph Combs , who was planning to be Raleigh 's contribution to the major leagues . He read Blondie and Dick Tracy and Part 22 of the serialized adventure story , and then he noticed the silence again and he lowered his paper to look at Ansel . Ansel was asleep , with one arm flung over his head and his fingers curling in around the sofa arm . His eyelids were translucent and faintly shining , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he had when he was twelve . Seeing him that way made James feel sad . He rose and came over to the couch , standing at Ansel 's head and looking down at his long pale face tipped back against the cushions . If he had n't known better , he would have tapped him on the shoulder and said , " Now I 'll listen . " But then Ansel would wake up and be twenty-six years old again , nervously testing himself for new symptoms , beginning some long monologue that he had begun before , changed forever from that scared small brother who could sit a whole evening without saying a word or raisinghis eyes from the floor . That twelve-year-old would vanish without a trace , leaving not even an echo of himself in the way Ansel smiled or said a certain word . James moved away from the couch and went over to the window . Because of the way he felt , the view from the windowtook on a sad , deserted look . Everything was bowed low under the breeze , straightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bicycle lay on its side with a drooping buttercup tangled in its spokes . At the edge of the yard the Potters ' insurance man was just climb/ing out of his Volkswagen . ( He came every week , because the Potters had to be constantly reassured that their policy really was all right . ) He looked tired and sad . While he was crossing the yard he mopped his face and straightened the plastic carnation in his buttonhole , and then on the first porch step he snapped his head erect and put a bright look on his face . After that James lost sight of him . But he could hear the knocking , and the sound of the Potters ' door cautiously opening and the bolts being slid back after the insurance man was taken inside . They slid easily in their little oiled tracks . The quickness of them made James smile , and he could picture Miss Lucy 's eager fingers fumbling rapidly at the locks , shutting little Mr. Harding in and the loneliness out for as long as she and Miss Faye could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . Back in the kitchen it was even worse . There was one daisy on the counter , a stray one from the field in back , and it was dead and collapsed against Ansel 's untouched lunch tray . ( " I 'm not eating today , " Ansel had said . " Do you care ? " " Suit yourself , " said James . ) Out the back window was the half-mowed field , looking bald and straggly . Simon Pike was leaning against an incinerator staring at it all , and while James watched , Simon straightened slowly and began wandering in small thoughtful circles around the incinerator . With the toes of his leather boots he kicked at things occasionally , and he had his shoulders hunched up again so that he looked small and worried . James stuck his head out the window . " Hey , Simon , " he said . " why do n't you come in ? "  |p206Simon  raised his head and looked at him . " What for ? " he asked . " Well , you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . " " Well , anyway , " said James , " I want to take a picture of you . " That made Simon think twice . He stood still for a moment to consider it , with his chin stuck out and his eyes gazing away from James and across the field . Then he said , " What kind of picture ? " " The kind you like . A portrait . " " Well , then , I reckon I might . I 'll come in and think about it . " " That 's the way , " said James . He let Simon come in his own good time , stopping to kick at a bootscraper and wasting several minutes examiningsome blistered paint on the door . When Simon was troubled about something , this was the way he acted . He circled all around the kitchen without once looking at James or speaking to him , and he picked up several things from counters and turned them over and over in his hands before setting them down again . Then he jammed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mama 's hemming a dress , " he said . " That 's good . " " She talks a little , too , but not about any concern of mine . " " Well , you got to give her time , " said James . " First thing people talk abut is weather and things . " " I know , " Simon said . " Daddy is at the fields , and Joan too . It 's her tobacco day . Everybody 's busy . "  | " So 're you , " said James . " You 're having your picture taken . " " Yeah , well . " But when James headed toward the darkroom , Simon followed him . " Where are we going to take it ? " he asked . " Outdoors , if you like . " " I 'd rather the living room . " " All right , " James said . He opened the door of the darkroom and led the way to where his cameras stood . " You got to be quiet , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's one of his dizzy days . " " Oh , tripes , " said Simon , and he started walking in circles again . He put the heel of one boot exactly in front of the toe of the other , and keeping his balance that way made him fling both arms out and tilt sideways slightly . " It 's a bad day for everyone , " he said . " I declare . " He seemed to be walking on an imaginary hoop , suspended high above the ground . James had seen the kind of portraits that Simon and Janie Rose liked best  --  the ones taken against a dead white screen , with the faces retouched afterwards . He favored a homier picture , himself . He left the screen behindand brought only a couple of lamps , not the glaring ones , and his favorite old box camera . " We 'll put you in the easy chair , " he told Simon . He had given the camera to Simon to carry , and Simon was squinting through the view-finder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing anything special ? "  | " Yes , " Simon said . " I want to be smoking a cigar . " " Be serious , now . " " I am serious . You asked me what I wanted to be doing . Well , all my life I 've been waiting to get my picturetook with a cigar . I been counting on it . " " Oh , what the hell , " said James . He set his lamps down and went over to the living-room mantelpiece . From the old wooden cigar box that had belonged to his grandfather he took a cigar , the fat black kind that he smoked on special evenings when no one was around to complain . " Here you go , " he said . " But do n't you light it , now . Just get your picture took with it . " " Well , thank you , " said Simon . He crossed to the easy chair , giving Ansel a sideways glance as he passed , but Ansel only stirred and did n't wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Simon whispered . " Me with a cigar , boy . " " It 'll all be recorded for posterity , " said James . While James was setting up the lights , Simon practicedwith the cigar . He opened it and slid the paper ring off , and then he sat with his elbow resting on the chair arm and his face in a furious frown every time he took a suck from the unlit cigar . " I 'm getting the hang of it , " he said , and looked around for an ashtray to practice tappingashes into . " When do you reckon they 'll let me smoke these for real ? " " Never , probably , " said James . " Always someone around that objects to the smell . " " Ah , I would n't care . I 'm going to start as soon as I 'm out on my own , boy . Soon as I turn sixteen or so . "  |p209James  smiled and tilted a lamp closer to Simon . He had been listening to Simon for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was planning to do at age sixteen . Smoke cigars , take tap-dance lessons , buy his own Woolworth 's , and grow sideburns . Janie Rose had n't even been going to wait that long . She asked her mother weekly , " Do you think it 's time I should be thinking of getting married ? " And then she would smile hopefully , showing two front teeth so new that they still had scallopededges , and everyone would laugh at her . James could see their point , though  --  Jamie 's and Simon 's . He could n't remember that being a child was so much fun . So he nodded at Simon and said , " When you turn sixteen , I 'll buy you a box , " and Simon smiled and settled back in the chair . " Might not wait till then even , " he said . " You never can tell . " " Well , I would , " said James . " Tobacco stunts your growth . " " No , I mean to go out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck out his tongue and flicked an imaginary piece of tobacco off the tip of it . " I been thinking where I could go . " " It 's kind of early for that , " James said . " I do n't know . You know Caraway , N.C. ? " James stopped fiddling with his camera and looked up . " What about it ? " he asked . " I just thought you could tell me about it . If that 's where you are from . " " Nothing to tell , " said James.  | " Well , there 's hats with feathers on them , and them gold earrings the boys all wear . Do you think I might like that town ? " In the view-finder his face was small and pointed , with a worried line between his eyes . He was leaning toward James with the cigar poised forgotten between his thumb and forefinger , and in the second of stillness that followed his question James snapped the picture . " That 'll be a good one , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see how . Do you ever see me going to Cara-way ? " " Well , the boys wear gold earrings , " Simon said again , and he sighed and rubbed the top of his head and James snapped that picture too . " Sure , the boys , " he told Simon . " They 're the worst in the state , Caraway boys . Got tight little Church of God parents . All they want to do when they grow up is come somewhere like Larksville . What you want to do in Car-away ? " " I could board with your family , " Simon said . James looked up from his camera with his mouth open and then threw back his head and laughed . " Hoo ! " he said , and Ansel stirred in his sleep at the noise . " I 'd like to see that , " he went on more quietly . " Would you turn sideways in your chair now , please ? " Simon turned , but he kept his eyes on James . " Ansel says  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ai n't he from there ? " " He do n't know . "  | " Well , anyway , " said Simon , " I could go and look it over . " " Your mother would love that . Now , quit watching out of the corner of your eye , Simon . Look at the fire-place . " " Do you think she 'd miss me ? " Simon asked . James clicked the picture and stood up , squinting at him sideways to see which way to turn him next . " I think my mother 'd say , Who you say 's gone ? Oh , Simon ! ' she 'd say . Him . My goodness . Did you remember to bring the eggs ? ' " He sat forward again then and frowned at James , twining the cigar over and under the fingers of his left hand . " You see how it 'd be , " he said . " You know that ai n't so , " said James . He stepped a little to one side and got Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the argumentto continue . But it did n't . In the square of the viewfinderSimon suddenly sighed and slumped down like a little old man , staring abstractedly at the wet end of his cigar . " Ah , hell , " he said . " It do n't matter . " That made James look up , but he did n't say anything . Instead he snapped the picture and frowned over at the lamps , measuring how much light there was . " Outdoors would 've been better , " he said finally . " I also hear , " said Simon , " that they sing all night in the dark . And them plumed hats , why , even the mules wear them . With holes cut for ears . " " Look over toward your left , " James said . " There 's six buses going there a day , Ansel told me . " James folded his arms across the top of the camera and watched Simon a minute , thinking . Simon staredp212straight back at him . In the light from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see beyond the flat surface of them . His chin was tilted outward a little , and his lashes with their sunbleached tips gleaming were like curtains over his expression . Who knew what was in his mind ? James uncrossed his arms then and said , " Put your cigar away , now . This last one 's for your mother . " " Aw , my mother wo n't even  --  " " She wants a picture she can show to the relatives . What would they think , you with a big fat cigar in your hand ? " " She wo n't  --  " Simon began again . But James said , " You 're growing so much , this summer . She wants to get you in a picture before you 're too big to fit in one . " " She tell you that ? " asked Simon . " Why , sure . " " She ask you out and out for a picture of me ? " " Sure she did , " James said . " She said , James , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of Simon . We do n't have a picture that looks like him no more . ' I said I 'd try . " Well , then , " said Simon after a minute . He rose and crossed over to the mantelpiece , where he laid down the cigar . When he returned to his chair he settled himself very carefully , tugging his jeans down tight into his boots , running both hands hard through his hair to smooth it back . He looked more posed now ; the relaxed expression that he had worn in the other pictures was gone . With both hands placed symmetrically on the arms of the chair , his back very straight and his face drawnp213tight in the beginnings of a smile , he stared unblinkingly into the lens of the camera . James waited a minute , and then he pressed the button and straightened up . " Thank you , " he said formally . " Oh , that 's all right . " " I 'll have them for you this afternoon , maybe . Or tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I want to take that before I start develop-ing . " " Okay , " said Simon . He stood up , frowningly tucking in his shirt , and then suddenly he looked over at James and gave him a wide , slow smile , so big that the two dents he was always trying to hide showed up in the center of his cheeks . " Well , I 'll be seeing you , " he said , and sauntered on out , slamming the screen door behind him . When James went to the window to look after him he saw him in the front yard , picking up the bicycle he had n't ridden for days and twirling the pedal into a positionwhere he could step on it . The buttercup still hung in the spokes , its little yellow head dangling drunkenly from the front wheel and its withered leaves fluttering out like banners when Simon rode slowly off . He rode in the direction of the Terrys ' farm ; he would be going to see the tobacco pickers , the way he used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when James had turned and seen that Ansel was sleeping still , he himself went out the screen door and down the long front porch . The Pikes ' window shades were up now . He peered in through the dark screen door and saw Mrs. Pike at her sewing machine , not running it at the minute but sewing by hand on something that was in her lap . " Mrs. Pike , "  |p214he  called gently . She lowered the sewing and looked up at him , her mouth screwed up and lopsided because of the pins in one corner of it . " Mrs. Pike , can I come in a minute ? " " Joan 's handing tobacco , " she said . Speaking around the pins made her seem like a different woman , like that waitress at the Royal Crown who always had a cigarette in her mouth when she talked . " Did you want to see Joan ? " " Well , no , I just wanted to tell you  --  " said James . He pulled open the screen door and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I took a picture of Simon , " he said . " Oh . " " Sitting in an easy chair . " " Well , that 's real nice , " said Mrs. Pike , and bowed her head to nip a thread off the dress she was sewing . " Well , I took it for you , Mrs. Pike . " " That 's real nice of you , " she said again . She held the dress up at arm 's length and frowned at it . James shifted his weight to his other foot . " What I actually told him , " he said , " was that you asked for it . Asked me to take it for you . " She lowered the dress to her lap again and looked over at him , and James thought that surely she would say something now . But when she did speak , all she said was , " It must be right hard , taking pictures of children "  --  politely , as if he were a stranger she was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did n't say more . She had lowered her head to her sewing again , fumbling at itp215with quick , blunt fingers and absentmindedly working the pins from one side of her mouth to the other . So he said , " Well , ma'am , not really , " and then turned and quietly let himself out the door again . All the way down to his end of the porch he kept thinking of going back and trying once more , but he knew already it was n't any use . So he entered his own part of the house and then just stood there a minute , thinking it over , watching Ansel as he slept.  |p216THE  THINGS Joan Pike owned in this world could be packed in two suitcases , with room to spare . She was putting them there now , one by one , folding the skirts in two and laying them gently on the bottom of the big leather suitcase her father 's parents had given him to take to a debating contest fifty years ago . Her own suitcase , newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked . She had saved out her big straw pocketbook , which was hard to pack and could hold all the things she might need on the bus . It stood on the floor , with one corner of a Greyhound ticket envelope sticking out of it . The ticket she had bought this morning , after spending all of Wednesday night lying in bed rolling up the hem of her top sheet while she thought what to do . She had ridden into town for it on Simon 's bicycle , and come back with it hidden inside her white shirt . Nobody knew she was going . When her closet was empty she cleaned it out care/fully , picking up every stray bobby pin and button from the floor and bunching the hangers neatly at one end of the rod with the hooks all pointing the same way . Mainly she wanted to save her aunt the trouble , but also she wanted to go away feeling that she had left a clean sweep behind her  --  not a thread , not a scrap of hers remaining that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it seem as if she had never been here , if that was possible . So she closed the closet door firmly and turned the key in its lock . Then she began on the rest of the room . She rolled her silver-backed dresser set in sweaters , so that none of the pieces would get scratched . Seeing the set , which her parents had given her on her eighteenth birthday , made her remember that she should be bringingback presents for them , and she frowned into the mirror when she thought about it . Always before , after two weeks at Scout camp even , she had brought back gifts for each of them and formally presented them , and her parents had done the same . But this time she had n't thought far enough in advance ; she would have to come home empty-handed . The idea bothered her , as if this were some basic point of guest etiquette that she , always a guest , had somehow forgotten . She shook her head , and laid the wrapped silver pieces carefully on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon was running an imaginary machine gun , shouting " ta-ta-ta-ta-tat " in a high voice that cracked and aiming at unknowing wrens who sat in the bushes behind the house . She could see him from her window  --  his foreshortened , blue denim body , the swirl of hair radiating out from a tiny white point on the backp218of his head . With luck , he would n't see her go . He would stay there in the back yard , and his mother would stay in bed for her afternoon nap , and she could sneak out of the house and across the fields without anyone 's seeing her . It might even be supper before they noticed . Mr. Pike would fuss a little , feeling responsible for his brother'schild . Mrs. Pike was still too sad to care , but Simon would care . He would ask why she had left without tellingthem , and how would they answer him ? How would she even answer him ? " Because I do n't want to think I 'm really going , " she would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in words . She stopped folding a slip and looked down at where Simon sat , with his legs bent under him and the toes of his boots pointing out , sighting along a long straight stick and pulling the trigger . As soon as she got home , she decided , she would telephone to make it all right with him . Then after supper James would come . " Joan ready ? " he 'd say . " She 's gone , " they 'd tell him . Then what would he do ? She could n't imagine that , no matter how hard she tried . Maybe he would say , " Well , I 'm sorry to hear that , " and remain where he was , his face dark and stubborn . Or maybe he would say , " I 'll go bring her back . " But that was something she did n't expect would ever happen now . A week ago , she might have expected it . She 'd thought anything could happen , anyone would change . But now all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty , James would still be enduring , on and on , in that stuffy little parlor with Ansel in it ; and she could n't endure a minute longer . She turned away from the window and went back top219her suitcase . Everything was in it now . The bureau was left as blank as the bureau in a hotel room ; its drawers were empty and smelled of wood again . On the back of the door hung her towel and washcloth , the only things left of her . She plucked them off the rack and carried them out to the laundry hamper in the hall , and then she was finished . No one would ever know she had lived here . When she had locked the second suitcase , and stepped into the high heels that she had taken off so as not to make a noise , she stood in the doorway a minute making sure of the blankness in the room . Then she picked up the two suitcases and the pocketbook and went downstairs . Carrying it all was harder than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one arm to the other , and although the suitcases were n't heavy they were big and bulky and banged against her legs when she walked . Before she was even off the front porch she was breathing hard . Then in the yard , the spikes of her high heels kept sinking into the earth and making things more difficult . If she 'd had any sense , she thought , she would have called Mr. Carleton and his taxi service . Except then everybody and his brother would have known she was leaving . She waited until she had crossed the road and was into the field and then she took her first breather , chafing the red palms of her hands and looking anxiously back at the house . No one had seen her yet . All the evening walks through this field with James or the children had taught her the shortest way to town  --  the straight line through burrs and bushes , leading ap/parently to nowhere but more field , emerging suddenly upon Emmett Smith 's back yard and from there to Main Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stockings , and kept her eyes strained ahead for the first sight of the Smith house . Around her ears the breeze made a hot , lulling sound , drying the dampness on her forehead to a cold thin sheet . Then another sound rose , like wailing , and she turned and saw Simon running to catch up , his brown hands fluttering to part the weeds in front of his chest and his face desperate . " Jo-oan ! " he was calling . He made two syllables out of it . Joan set down the suitcases and waited , with her hands crossed over her pocketbook . " Joan , wait ! " he said , and flounderedon . " Oh , Simon , " she said , but she kept waiting . When he came up even with her he was out of breath , and covered with burrs . For a while he just stood there panting , but then his breath came more slowly and he straightened up . " Can I come ? " he asked . " Oh , Simon  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't find you ; I thought  --  " He stopped , and switched his eyes from her face to the field behind her . " I would n't be a bit of trouble , " he said softly . She leaned forward , trying to catch his words , and he said it louder : " I would n't be a bit of  --  " " Well , I know that . " " Old James came over with that picture he took yesterday , " he said . " You were gone off on my bicycle . Ile brought it in a special brown envelope like he does to customers . I said , Mama , here is that picture you was asking for . ' She says , What ? ' I pulled it out to show her.  |p221She  said , Oh , ' and then went back to her sewing and did n't look any more . I put it back on James 's doorstep . " " Well , now , do n't you worry  --  " said Joan , but she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking about . She stood frowning at him , with the wind whipping the hair around her face and her hands clenched white on the pocketbook . " I wo n't be a bit of trouble , " he said again . She said , " No , " and stooped nearer to him . " I ca n't take you , " she said . " I have to go off , Simon . And you have to stay with your family . When they are back to normal , though , you can come and visit . " Simon just stood there , very straight . She did n't know what to do , because he had his head drawn back in that way he had and if she 'd hugged him he would have hated her . So she waited a minute , and then she said , " Well , goodbye . " He did n't answer . " Goodbye , " she said again . She kept on facing him , though , because she could n't turn first and just leave him there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way forever he swung around and left , and she watched him go . He stumbled through the field in a zigzagging line , not partingthe grass ahead of him but pressing on with his hands at his sides . " Simon ? " she called once . But Simon never answered . When she turned away herself , and bent to pick up her bags again , she was thinking that out of all the bad things she had ever done this might be the one sin . It made her feel suddenly heavy and old ; the weight of her sadness dragged behind her through the fields like anothersuitcase , and she could n't look up or let herselfp222think about anything but walking , putting one foot ahead of the other . The Smith house loomed up suddenly , just beyond a little rise in the ground . Inside a wire fence the hens scratched irritably at the dirt , and from the house came the sound of someone 's singing . Joan set her suitcases down and looked back , thinking to see some sign of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope of wild grass stretching as far as she could see . Behind that was James , dark and slow and calm , rocking easily in his chair and never knowing . And that long front porch where she and Simon used to shell peas on summer evenings , while Janie Rose sang " The Murder of James A. Garfield " through the open window . She picked up her suitcases and walked on , with that sudden light , lost feeling that came from walking in a straight line away from people she loved . The clock in the drugstore where the buses stopped said there were ten minutes to go . Tommy Jones behind the soda fountain checked her bags and handed her the tags , and she said , " Thank you , " and smiled at him dazedly without thinking about him . " Coke while you wait ? " he asked . " No , thank you . " " On the house . " " Oh , no . " Her voice sounded thin and sad . She felt like a stick , very straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely people should have noticed it , but they did n't ; Tommy smiled at her as if this were am normal day , and the two other people in the store wentp223on leafing through their magazines . Dan Thompson 's wife came in , wearing one of Dan 's baggy printing aprons the way she usually did and carrying a fresh stack of this week 's newspapers . The insides of her forearms were smeared with ink from them . When she saw Joan she smiled and came over toward her . " Hi , " she said . " You want a paper ? " " T guess so , " said Joan . She fished in her purse for the money and handed it over , and Carol gave her a paper off the top of the stack . " Nothing but the most startling news , " she said . " We took it all from the Rockland paper this week . Usually we get it from Clancyville . " " Well , that 's all right , " Joan said . " I have n't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I think sometimes ? " She heaved the papers onto a soda fountain stool and began rubbing the muscles of her arm . " Sometimes I think , what if every paper gets its news from the other papers ? What if this is twenty-year-old news we 're reading , just circulating around and around among newspapers ? " " I do n't suppose it 'd make much difference , " Joan said absently . " Well , maybe not . " She picked up the papers again . " You bring James over for supper some night , you hear ? We have n't had the two of you together in a long time . " " All right , " said Joan . She did n't see much point in telling Carol she was leaving , not if Carol had n't noticed for herself . And she had n't . She went off jauntily , with a wave of her hand , and threw the papers on the floor inp224front of the magazine rack and left the store . Yet there was Joan , all dressed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other customers again , but they went on reading their magazines . When the bus drew up , she was the only person to board it . The driver did n't smile or even look at her ; already she was outside the little circle of Larksville , and only another stranger to the people on this bus . She sat in a seat by herself , toward the rear , and smoothed her skirt down and then looked at the other passengers . None of them looked back except a sailor , who stopped chewing his gum and winked , and she quickly looked away again and sat up straighter . The bus started with a jerk and wheezed up to full speed along Main Street , making a sad , going-away noise . Through the green-tinted windows Larksville looked like an old dull photograph , and that made her sad too , but once they had passed the town limits she began to feel better . Some of that light feeling came back . It crossed her mind , as she was pullingon her gloves , that all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading alone in a little house kept by old people , remembering to greet her mother 's friends on the street , smiling indulgently at other people'schildren . But then she shook that thought away , and folded her gloved hands in her lap and began looking out the window again . It was almost an hour before the bus made its next stop , in a town called Howrell that Joan had always hated . Gangling men stood lined along the street , spittingtobacco juice and commenting on the passengers whose faces appeared in the bus windows . Underneathp225Joan was the slamming and banging of bags being shoved into the luggage compartment , and then the driver helped a little old lady up the steps and into the bus . She wore a hat made entirely of flowers . From the way she advanced , clutching her pocketbook in both hands , examining the face of each passenger and sniffing a little as she passed them , Joan knew she would sit beside her . Old ladies always did . She stopped next to Joan and said , " This seat taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer . While she was getting settled she huffed and puffed , making little comments under her breath ; she would be the talkative kind . " I thought this bus would never come , " she said . " I thought it had laid down and died on the way . " Joan smiled , and turned her face full to the window . ' When the bus had started up again , and was rolling through the last of Howrell , Joan checked her watch . It would be nearly suppertime now . If she were in Larksvilleshe would be sitting at the kitchen table cutting up a salad . She pictured herself there , her bare feet curled around the rungs of the chair . In her mind she seemed to be sitting an inch or so above the seat , not resting on anything but air . She ran through other pictures of herself  --  sitting in her parents ' parlor , sitting on the porch with James , even sitting now beside this old lady on a bus rolling west . In all the pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the firmest seat she knew  --  James 's lap , in the evenings when Ansel had alreadygone to bed . But even there , there was a good two inches of air beneath her and she seemed to be balanced there precariously , her arms tight around James . Shep226turned away from the window quickly and said to the old lady , " It 'll be getting dark soon . " " It certainly will , " said the lady . " My daughter will be getting supper on now . The married one . I left them a cold hen , barbecued the way I like to do it . " Joan went back to looking out the window . She stared steadily at the clay banks that rose high and red along the side of the road , and the tall thin tobacco barns from which little strings of brightly dressed women were scatteringhome for supper . Who would take her place tomorrowat the tobacco table ? She stopped watching the barns . All around her in the bus , people were settled firmly in their seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads tipped against the white starched bibs on the backs of the seats . They talked to one anotherin murmuring voices that mingled with the sound of the motor . A little boy was playing a tonette . " I 'm going to my other daughter , " the old lady told her . " The one that never married . She has a kidney ail-ment . " " I 'm sorry to hear that , " said Joan . " She 's in terrible pain , and there 's no one to take care of her . " Out of the corner of her eye Joan saw the Larksvillc paper she had bought , folded neatly and tucked down between her seat and the wall of the bus . She picked it up quickly and unfolded it , and the old lady turned away again . There would be nothing interesting in the paper , but she read it anyway . She began with the first page andp227read through the whole paper methodically , not even skipping the ladies ' meeting announcements or the advertisements . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two deaths . The first death was Jones , Laramie D. , whom she had never heard of , but she read all about him anyway  --  the circumstances of his death , the highlights of his life , the list of relatives who had survived him . The second death was Pike , Janie Rose . The name hit into her stomach , as if she had n't known of the death until this instant . She started to pass over it , but then she went back to it and read it through : Pike , Janie Rose . At County Hospital , in her sixth year , of internal injuries caused by an accident . Beloved daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Roy J. Pike , sister of Simon Lockwood Pike . Funeral was held from Collins Memorial Home , July 16 , interment in family cemetery . She read it twice , but it seemed unreal still , something vague and far off . Nothing that bad could happen . When she had finished with it a second time she folded the paper very carefully in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went on to the rest of the paper . She read very closely now , even moving her lips , so as to shut out all thought of anything she had read before . " Teller-Hokes Wedding Held in First Baptist Church , " she read , and although neither name meant anything to her she was careful to find out exactly what the bride wore and who her guests were . Next came the memorial notices , ringed in black like the obituaries . She hadp228never looked at the memorial notices before . She read about someone named Auntie Peg Myers , who had passed away on July 16 , 1937 , and was dearly remembered by her two nieces . Then she read about Nathan Martin , who had been taken from his wife in 1941 . For him there was a quotation . " Too dearly beloved ever to be forgotten , " it said . Further down , for other people , there were little poems , but Joan stopped reading . She had a sudden picture of all the years of this century , stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yellower as the years grew older . 1937 was almost orange , older than she herself was ; 1941 was growing brittle at the edges . How would this year look ? The print on January was already blurred . And then she pictured how it would be when today was yellowed too , years from now , and the Pikes themselves were buried and Simon an old man . Then on the third week in every July he would print his notice : " In memory of Janie Rose , who passed away just fifty years ago July 13th . Fondly remembered by her brother Simon . " He would be remembering her as someone very small with spectacles , who had lived in the tacked-on bedroom in back of the house . But he himself would be a grandfather then , and nobody Janie would recognize . How would Simon look in fifty years ? Joan tried to think , but all she saw was Simon as he was today  --  hunching his shoulders up , tucking his head down in that uncertain way he had . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling up , and the bus station with its linep229of coin machines . " Is this where you get off ? " the woman asked her . " No . " " Oh . You just sat up so sudden  --  " " No , " said Joan , " but I think I might buy a Coke . " She stood and wormed her way out past the woman 's knees , and as soon as she was out the woman slid quickly over to the window . Joan did n't care . She went down the aisle without looking at anyone , and then descended the bus steps . A team of some kind was waiting to board , a group of boys in white satin windbreakerswith numbers on them , and when Joan stepped down among them they remained stolidly in her path , ignoring her . " Excuse me , " she said , " excuse me , please , " and then when no one noticed she shouted , " Excuseme ! " For a minute they stopped talking and stared at her ; then they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding her head up . Out here she felt thinner and more alone than before , with the team of boys all watching her down the long path to the Coke machine . And when she reached the machine she found she did n't even want a Coke . But she put her dime in anyway , and just as she was reaching for the bottle someone said , " Ma'am ? " It was a young man in sunglasses , standing beside her and looking straight at her . She felt scared suddenly , even with all those people around ( had he been able to see how alone she felt ? ) and she decided not to answer . Instead she uncapped the Coke bottle and then turned to go.  | " Ma'am ? " he said again . She could n't just leave him there , still asking . " What is it ? " she said . " Can you show me where the restroom is ? " " ' Why , it 's right inside , I guess . Over there . " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see . " " Over there . " " I do n't see . I 'm blind . " " Oh , " said Joan , and then she just felt silly , and even sadder than before . " Wait a minute , " she told him . She turned around and saw two bus drivers walking toward her , looking kind and cheerful . When they came even with her she tapped the older driver on the arm and said , " Urn , excuse me . " " Yes . " " Can you show this man the restroom ? He does n't see . " " Why , surely , " said the driver . He smiled at her and then took the blind min by the elbow . " You come with me , " he said . " Thank you , sir . Thank you , ma'am . " " You 're welcome , " Joan said . The other driver stayed behind , next to Joan . He said , " Can you imagine traveling blind ? " and stared after the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't " Joan said . She automatically followed the driver 's eyes . Now that she looked , she could n't think why the blind man had frightened her at first . He wore his clothes obediently , as if someone else had put them.  |p231on  him  --  the neat dark suit with the handkerchief in the pocket , the shoes tied lovingly in double knots . He remindedher of something . For a minute she could n't think what , and then she remembered and smiled . That slow , trusting way he let himself be guided forward , with his hands folded gently in front of him , was like Simon during the first year she 'd lived there , when he was six and still had to be awakened at night and taken to the bathroom so he would n't wet his bed . He had gone just that obediently , but with his eyes closed and the shadows of some dream still flickering across his face . ( You could n't stop walking with him for a minute , not in a doorway or going around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had reached the bathroom and proceed to go right then and there . ) He had held his elbows in close to his body that way , too , against the coolness of the night . Joan stopped smiling and looked down at her feet . " You all right ? " the driver asked . " I want to go back . " " Ma'am ? " " I want to go back where I came from . Can I take my bags off my bus and wait for the next one going back ? " " Why , surely , " the driver said . " You on that bus over there ? " " Yes . I know this is  --  " " Women got a right to change their minds , " the driver called . He was already heading toward her bus , and Joan followed him with her untouched Coke bottle still in her hands . " I always do this , " she said . " But this time it 's  --  "  | " You got the right , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help it , this time ; I 'm not just  --  " But the driver did n't hear her . He was walking up ahead of her and laughing over his shoulder , thinking it was all a joke . She stopped trying to tell him it wasn't.  |p233SOMETHING  WAS WRONG at home . James knew it instantly , the moment he stepped out of the pickup carrying his two bags of groceries . There on the porch stood the Potter sisters and Ansel and Mrs. Pike , all huddling together , and Mr. Pike was a little distance away from them . He was facing toward the road , frowning down at an Indian elephant bell that he held in his hand . When he heard the pickup door slam he looked up and said , " James . " The light from the setting sun turned his face strange and orange . " What 's wrong ? " said James . " We ca n't find Simon . " " Well , where is he ? " he asked , and then to cover up the stupidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at lunchtime . " " We thought you might have him with you , " Mr. Pike said . " No. "  |p234They  all kept looking at him . Even Ansel . James hoisted his groceries up higher and then said again , " No . No , I 've been running errands all afternoon . All by my-self . " " Well , then , " Mr. Pike said . He sighed and turned back to the others , who still waited . Finally he said , " He 's not with James . " " Maybe he 's with Joan , " James offered . " No . Joan must have gone off somewhere , but after she left Simon was still around . Lou says so . " James looked over at Mrs. Pike . She was dry-eyed and watchful ; her arms were folded firmly across her chest . " When was the last time you noticed him ? " he asked her . " I do n't know . " " Ma'am ? " " I do n't know , " she said , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the boys he plays with , " Mr. Pike said . " And we called the movie-house . " " Did you ask about buses ? " " No . Why ? " " I 'd do that , " said James . He climbed the steps at his end of the porch and set the groceries on Ansel 's chair , and then he straightened up and rubbed the muscles of his arms . " Call the drugstore , " he said . " Ask them if he 's  --  " " Well , I went to the drugstore , to see if he 'd gone there for a soda . Mary Bennett was on ; only been there a half hour or so , but she had n't seen him . "  | " Might have gone earlier , " said James . " Did you look at the bus schedule ? " " No I did n't . What would I want to do that for ? " " Just in case , " James said . " Who was there before Mary Bennett ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it were n't for Lou I 'd just sit and wait for Simon , but Lou thinks he left with a purpose . Thinks she might have sent him away somehow . " James looked over at Mrs. Pike again . For a minute she stared back at him ; then she said , " You believe he 's on some bus . " " I did n't say that , " said James . " You think it . " " Now , Lou , " Mr. Pike told her . " I can tell . " " Well , it would n't hurt to ask , " said James . " I 'd track that Tommy down , if I was you . " " Oh , now , " Mr. Pike said , and accidentally clanged the elephant bell . Everyone jumped . " Sorry , " he said . For the first time , Ansel lost his blank tense look ; he winced , and leaned back limply against the front of the house . Mr. Pike said , " Sorry , Ansel . But where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lots of places , " said James . " Not as many as you 'd think , " Ansel said . " World 's shrinking . " " Hush , " James told him . He jingled his keys thoughtfully . " Roy , can I use your telephone ? " " What for ? " " Let him , " Mrs. Pike said . The Potter sisters steppedp236closer to her on either side and patted her shoulders , as if she had suddenly had an outburst of some kind . " You know where it is , " she told James . " Yes , ma'am . " He walked toward the Pikes ' end of the porch , with everyone 's eyes following him . At the door he stopped and said , " Did he have any money ? " " He gets an allowance , " said Mr. Pike . " I do n't know if he saved it . " " Did he get some this week ? " He was asking this of Mrs. Pike , but she just shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James turned back again and went on inside . It was Tommy Jones 's mother who answered the telephone . Her voice was breathless , as if she had had to come running from some other part of the house . " Hello ? " she said . " Mrs. Jones , this is James Green . Is Tommy there ? " " No , he 's not . " " Do you know where he is ? " " No . Is this about Simon still ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " They have n't found him ? " " No . Do you think Tommy 'll be getting back soon ? " " I really do n't , " she said . " He 's off someplace with his girl . Shall I have him call ? " " No , thank you . Sorry to bother you . " " It 's no bother . " He hung up and stood thinking a while , and then he went out to the front porch again . In just the short time that the telephone call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sunset into twilight . The others were standing where he had left them , still looking in his direction as if their eyes had never moved from the spot where he had disappeared . " Tommy 's not there , " he said . " Well , I could have told you that , " Mr. Pike said irritably . He swung his arms down , making the bell clang again , and started toward the front yard . " I 'm going to round up a couple others , " he called back . " We 'll look in all the places where he goes , and ring bells or fire guns if we find him . Want to come , James ? " " I 'm not sure that 's the way , " James said . " Only thing I can think of . Mind if I use your truck ? " " Well , wait , " said James . He came down the steps and crossed over to Mr. Pike . " No , I 'd like to take the truck and follow up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I was a little boy . . . " Ansel announced , and everyone turned around to look at him . he had recovered from that last clang and was standing erect now , placing the tips of his fingers together . " When I was a little boy , I had to tell my mother everywhere I went . It was a rule . And I could never go out of hearing range of this old Army bugle , that my father would stand in the doorway and blow at suppertime  --  " " If you could come along , " Mr. Pike told James , " and bring a noisemaker of some kind , why , we could startby  --  " " I was thinking of Caraway , " James said . " Caraway ? " " I was thinking that was where he might 've gone . " " Oh , Caraway , " Mr. Pike said impatiently . " I beenp238there . No , more likely he went off on some hike or other , and forgot to let us know . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James . " But James , that 's a waste of  --  " " Let him , " said Mrs. Pike , and once again the Potter sisters closed in on her and patted her shoulders . " Hush , hush , " they whispered . James pulled out his billfold and checked his money ; there was plenty for gas . He turned to Mr. Pike . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I just feel I know where he 's at . " " Well , that 's all right , " said Mr. Pike . " Sure wish I could have the loan of your pickup , though . " " I 'll make the trip as fast as I can . " " Well , sure . " Mr. Pike sighed , and then he set off wearily across the yard . He carried the elephant bell upsidedown , with his fingers poked through the inwardcurlingteeth of it to hold the clapper silent . ' When he reached the gravel road he turned back and said , " Ansel ? You feel up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ansel . " I just feel miserable about all this . " Mr. Pike nodded several times and then continued down the road in the direction of the Terrys . " Poor man , " said Miss Lucy , and then she and Miss Faye beganpatting Mrs. Pike harder than before . James said , " Ansel , take in the groceries . And fix yourself something for supper , in case I 'm late getting back . " " Well , all right , " Ansel said . " I do n't expect you want to come with me. "  | " No . " James descended the porch steps . In the distance he could see Mr. Pike , far and small already , marching on steadily with his shoulders set . It seemed so clear to James that Simon was in Caraway  --  where else would he be ?  --  that he felt sorry to see Mr. Pike going to all this trouble . He wanted to call him back , but he knew there was no use . So he just turned around and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was standing right behind him . " Oh , excuse me , " he said . " I did n't hear you coming . " She remained silent , with her arms still folded and her head bowed meekly . " Well , " he said . " Ansel , I 'm going to call you at the Pikes ' number when I get there . To tell you what happens , in case Mrs. Pike is going to be over at the Potters ' . " " All right , " said Ansel . " Does that mean I can stay at the Pikes ' until you call ? " " I do n't care , for heaven 's sake . " He continued on toward the pickup , and Mrs. Pike kept following after him . When he opened the door on the driver 's side she opened the other door , and it was only then that he realized she meant to come along . They stood staring at each other for a minute across the expanse of seat ; then Mrs. Pike lowered her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could see that the others on the porch were just as surprised as he was  --  they came closer together , and turned to look at each other  --  but Mrs. Pike did n't offer to explain herself . She sat quietly , with her eyes straight ahead and her hands clasped in her lap . Even when he craned his neck around to look out the rear window as he was backing out , shep240stared ahead . The stoniness of her face gave her a calm , sure look , as sure as James felt inside ; she must know where Simon was by instinct . When they were on the main highway James turned his lights on . Already the opaque white look of early twilight was growing bluer and more transparent , and other cars as they came towards him clicked their own lights on . But he could see around him clearly still : the landmarks of the journey to town slipping by , and then a brief glimpse of Main Street itself before he passed it . It felt funny to keep going straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his stomach , and he looked into the rear-view mirror and watched the town lights fading away from him . " Do n't worry , " he said suddenly to Mrs. Pike , but Mrs. Pike was n't looking worried at all ; she only nodded , calmly . " I 'm just waiting , " she told him . " Oh . " " I 'll take what I get . Whatever I deserve . " " Yes , ma'am , " James said . He swerved around a little boy riding a bicycle . Where was Simon at this minute ? Maybe swaggering down a street alone , trying to look as if he knew where he was going . Searching for some sign  --  a boy with a ring in his ear or a woman in a red-plumed hat , someone who would expect him the way he had expected them . James frowned . The clomping of Simon 's leather boots seemed louder than the sound of the motor ; the fuzz down the back of Simon 's neck seemed clearer than the road ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said.  | " Yes . " " Where 's Joan ? " " I do n't know , " said Mrs. Pike . She looked out at the road a while , and then she said , " I sewed a dress today . " " Oh , did you ? " " Yes . " " Well , now , " James said . He cleared his throat . " I always thought a dress would take days to make . " " Anything that happens , " said Mrs. Pike , " it 's only my fault . My fault . " " Well , now , " James said again . The truck was traveling too fast , he thought . Already the countryside looked like Caraway countryside ; not Larksville . In his mind he had added mile upon mile to this trip , stretching the road out long and thin till Carawaymight have been in Asia . Yet before they had been on the road half an hour they reached Stevens 's Esso Station  --  the halfway mark  --  and he braked sharply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pike . She nodded . The meter said the tank was half full , but stopping this way would slow things down a little . Mr. Stevens himself washed the windshield and filled the tank , with only a brief smile to James because he did n't recognize him . " Three dollars , ten , " he said . " Nice evening . " He held his hand out flat , palm up , outside James 's window , and James counted out the exact change very slowly . When he had paid he said , " This the road to Caraway ? " to stretch the stop out even longer . " Sure is , " the man said . " How much further ? "  | " Be there in half an hour . " " Thank you , " James said . He started the motor and looked over at Mrs. Pike , but she did n't seem surprised at the questions he had asked . She just looked down at her hands and waited for him to drive on . Almost no one else was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , and in silence , looking at the country around him whenever they were on a straight stretch of road . At first it was just the occasional , very noticeable things that he recognized  --  that humped bridge that looked like something off a willowware plate , the funny barbecue house off in the middle of nowhere with pigs chasing each other rapidly in neon lights across the front porch . But after another ten or fifteen minutes , he began to recognize everything . The objects that flashed by were all worn and familiar-looking , as if perhaps without knowing it he had been dreaming of them nightly . Even the new things  --  the brick ranch houses rising baldly out of fresh red clay , the drive-ins and Dairy Queens  --  seemed familiar , and he glanced at them mildly and without surprise . ' When he reached the town limits it was just beginning to grow really dark , and his headlights glared briefly against the slick white surface of a newly painted sign . " Caraway . Bird Sanctuary , " it read . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caraway . " And he had looked at it and thought , I 'll never see that sign again , not for any reason . He had n't known the Pikes then , nor Joan , nor the Potters ; he had n't foreseen the existence of Simon . He slowed down as soon as they reached the actual town , and Mrs. Pike straightened up and began lookingp243out the window more intently , perhaps already searching for Simon . James kept his eyes straight ahead until they got to Main Street . Then he pointed to an all-night grill and said , " This is where the buses stop . " " Oh , " said Mrs. Pike . " Do you want to go ask if they 've seen him ? " " I guess so , " she said , but she was looking at him , obviously expecting that he would be the one to ask . He sighed and swung the truck into a diagonal parking place . " I 'll be right out , " he told her . " All right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pickup , he felt clumsy and conspicuous . Girls in barebackeddresses waited with their dates in front of the movie theater next door , and when he stepped on to the sidewalk they pivoted on their high heels and glanced over at him . He stared back , but there was no one he recognized . And the waitress in the grill was a new one  --  a fat blond he did n't know . He came up and laid both hands palms down on the counter and said , " Were you here when the last bus from Larksville came ? " " Yes , " she said . Her voice was tired , and she seemed hardly able to raise her eyes and look at him . " Did you see a little boy get off ? " " I was n't watching , " she said . She began swabbing off the counter with a pink sponge , and James walked out again without thanking her . On the street he looked up and down , hooking his thumbs in his belt and staring over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon . For the first timep244he felt uncertain about him , and frightened . He returned to the truck . " She was n't watching , " he told Mrs. Pike . " She was n't , " she agreed , and went on looking calmly out the window . James knew where he was heading , but he was hoping he did n't have to go there . So he drove down Main Street very slowly , looking right and left , peering into the windows of restaurants and soda shops and scanning the faces of people out for evening walks . Several times he saw people he knew . Seen through the truck window , walking in half-dark , six years older and unexpected in new clothes that James had never known , they looked worn and sad to him . He would look after them a minute with a feeling of bewilderment , almost forgetting Simon until Mrs. Pike touched him on the arm . Then he would drive on . Mrs. Pike did n't ask what he was doing when he turned off Main Street . She seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caraway that anyone might follow , and she gazed in tourist-like respect at a three-foot high statue of Major John Caraway . ( " This is Major Caraway , " James 's father always explained to them . " He fought in the Big War . " Meaning the Civil War , though there 'd been others since . " He certainly was a small man , " said their mother . Their father never answered that . ) Even when they turned down Hampden Street , where there were no statues and only private houses , Mrs. Pike said nothing . She kept on searching the sides of the road , poking her nose toward the window so that the skin between her chin and the base of her throatp245made one slanted line . James drove more and more slowly . He turned left on Winton Lane and then drew to a stop , letting the truck roll into the grass at the side of the road . They were in front of an old gray house with a great many gables , its yard sprinkled with the featherwhiteskeletons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while James sat silent , tapping the steering wheel with one finger . Then he looked over at Mrs. Pike . She was still searching out the window , almost as if she thought they were still moving . " I 'll be back , " he told her . " All right . " He opened the truck door and climbed out stiffly , careful not to make too much noise . But no dog barked . In his mind , he saw now , he had pictured the dog 's barkingfirst . He had imagined that everyone would come to the door to investigate , long before he had reached the front steps ; he had seen the long rectangle of yellow light from the doorway and the silhouettes of many people , watching as he walked awkwardly through the dandelions . Yet he came to the door in utter silence , with no one noticing . He opened the screen , which creaked , and knocked several times on the weatherbeaten wooden door and waited . For a while no one came . Then there were footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes on a point just a little above his own eye level , where he would see that hard white face as soon as the door opened . But when the door did open , he had to look lower than that . He had to look down to the level of his shoulders , much lower than he had remembered , into the oldp246man 's small lined face and his eyes in their pockets of bone . His hair was all white now , gleamingly clean . He wore suspenders , snapped over a frayed white collarless shirt which was only folded shut , without buttons . And his trousers bagged at the knees . " The dog did n't bark , " said James . " She died , " his father said , and stepped back a step to let him into the house.  |p247THE  FIRST THING Simon said was , " If I 'd known you were coming , I 'd of hitched a ride with you . " He was sitting in old Mr. Green 's platform rocker , with his elbows resting lightly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . " Did you just leave home and not tell anyone ? " he asked . " I told everyone , " said James , and looked straight across at the others . They stood in a line behind Simon , the three of them  --  his father , Claude , and Clara , the one brother and sister still at home . They were standing very still , all three of them in almost exactly the same position , with their eyes on James . When James looked at them Simon turned around and looked too , and just in that one turn of his head , with his chin pointed upwards and the shock of hair falling back off his forehead , he seemed to be claiming them somehow , marking them as his own . James 's father looked down at him soberly , and Clara smiled , but by then Simon had turned to Jamesp248again and could n't see her . " I came on a bus , " he said . " I guessed you had . " " I found them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you sit down ? " " Oh , I guess not , " said James . " Did you call the po-lice ? " " I do n't hold with police , " his father said . " I forgot . " " We figured you 'd come after him . We did n't call no one . " " I see , " James said . He folded his arms and stared down at one shoe . " His mother was wondering where he was . " " Well , now she 'll know , " said his father . " Your mother used to wonder . " " Sir ? " " What did she say ? " Simon asked . " Did she see I was gone ? What did she say about it ? " Instead of answering , James turned around and looked out the open door . There was Mrs. Pike , picking her way through the dandelions and toward that rectangleof light across the porch . She had come unasked , having waited long enough in the pickup , and because she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing here her face had a puckered , uncertain look . She stumbled a little on the porch and then came forward , her eyes squinting against the light . " James  --  " she began , and then saw Simon and stopped . " Is that Simon ? " she asked . Her fingers began plucking at her skirt , and she stayed poised there on the porch . Simon stood up and looked at James , but he did n't say anything.
