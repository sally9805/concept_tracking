But Scott said that he and attorneys general and their representatives from six other states , meeting at O'Hare air- , port , agreed this was not the proper appoach . They thought the answer was to support each other in direct action against polluters , he said . Denies Feud with Ogilvie " There is no feud between Gov . Ogilvie and myself , " Scott said . " The governor has suggested one method . I have taken : his suggestion under considera. tion . We feel direct action will produce the most immediate results . " Ogilvie , in his address before the federation 's annual meeting in the Palmer House , said he favored filing the suit in the Supreme court because it is the court of jurisdiction in interstate matters , because " speed ' : is essential , " and to avoid dc- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Illinois Also to Blame " But he stressed that " the enemy is pollution " and " not our sister states , our industries or theirs , or the municipalities of any state or region . " Tho Illinois would bring the suit , he said , " Illinois is far from blameless in the deadly poisoning of Lake Michigan . " The suit he proposes , the governor said , would involve also the major industries and municipal corporations " responsible for the wanton pollution of the lake . " " If we do not stop the empty rhetoric , the foot drugging , the confusion , anti the uncoordinated efforts of the past , irreparable harm will be done to . he lake . . . .

Then Scott , speaking for the group , told reporters in part : " Suits between states are complicated , delayed , and expensive . We feel that our cooperative efforts should be aimed at the real goal  --  cleaning up Lake Michigan  --  and not engaging in internecine warfare between states . " States , as such , are not polluters . Our lake is being destroyed by individual polluters , industrial , municipal , and private . Our efforts should directly attack these sources . " We have agreed that when an individual state takes action against a polluter , wherever located , the attorneys general of the states bordering Lake Michigan will , on a case basis , undertake to join as friends of the court and contribute legal and technical assistance . " Then , in response to questions , Scott said : " Gov . Ogilvie and I are working together constantly . No two people agree on everything . We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
