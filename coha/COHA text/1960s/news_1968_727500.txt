What is more , West German pay packets will continue to grow next year , which might not have been the case had Bonn yielded to allied pressure and revalued the mark . The United States , Britain , and France , according to German Finance Minister Franz Josef Strauss , came to the Bonn conference determined to obtain a revaluation of the mark . Raising the value of the mark to 3.60 to the dollar perhaps , from its present 4 , might or might not have cut German exports sufficiently to slow down West German factory production and even cause some unemployment . But the Germans thought this might happen . So Bonn 's gold dust twins , Mr. Strauss , and Economics Minister Karl Schiller , dug in their heels and refused to comply . On Nov. 22 Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesflger backed up his ministers by promising the Germans " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he remained chancellor .

Naturally , this arouses against the 3ermans , who-25 years after World War II // *For Paris , Londonn-uspinch is on //  --  are much better off than the European victors . Some press reports in London and Paris assert that the German acted with arrogance in refusing to revalue the mark . But these charges do not ring true to many observers here . Strength of currency The deutsche mark grew strong because a disciplined West German labor force avoided strikes and because the government nipped inflation by clamping on fiscal and monetary controls in time .

Destroyed during the war , Germany 's industrial plant could be modernized from scratch . Hitler had bequeathed the Germans an autobahn highway system that greatly aided the flow of goods and materials from one part of the country to another . Neither France nor Britain had anything to match this . Finally , and of key significance , the exodus of nine million Germans from Communist-occupied Central Europe gave the federal republic a skilled labor pool , eager to work . This influx of newcomers was an added inducement to German unions to avoid strikes , since ? until the economy regained its full stride ? other workers always were available . Despite its refusal to revalue the mark , West Germany was the first among the group of 10 powers to announce measures designed to restore monetary stability . Revised taxes included These included revised taxes to make German exports more expensive and imports cheaper . Bonn also acted to halt the flow of hot money into the federal republic .

Hard to assess , but bound to occur , is a shift of political weight within the alliance , as France and Britain struggle to regain their footing . President de Gaulle always has insisted , that France was , and should be , the senior partner within the special Paris-Bonn axis sealed by a 1963 treaty of friendship between the two nations . That insistence manifeStly was based on illusion , which now will be stripped away , as the franc crumbles before the strength of the mark . The German-British relationship also is complex . Bonn has acted as London 's advocate within the Common Market  --  though never to the point of angering General de Gaulle . Feelings ruffled Now , however , German and British feelings have been ruffled by the monetary crisis . British officials resent the unchanged parity of the mark .

" The mark would collapse overnight , " one observer remarked , " if the United States simply took its Army home . " He exaggerated for effect .
