ONCE , the art of the silversmith was high art . In the Middle Ages silver in Europe was reserved for kings , princelings and powers , whether religious or secular . An established sculptor like Benvenuto Cellini did not consider it beneath him to fashion elaborate silver ewers and saltcellars , even though they looked more like the Trevi fountain than a functional device . <P> The tradition of artistic elegance passed on to succeeding generations of silversmiths , and continued even after the discovery of Peru 's rich silver mines in 1533 made the metal available to Europe 's relatively common people . A selective congeries of master craftsmen began to turn out standard household items : porringers , tankards , sherry beakers , stirrup cups , and such utilitarian items as knives and spoons . Their art was so prolific , in fact , that for years nobody paid much attention to the artistic quality of their products . <P> Somewhat Stunned . In the past several years , collectors have discovered that a good many of these early designers not only produced objects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been matched . The result has been a spectacular boom in the silver market that has left even its dealers somewhat stunned . In the past four years , they figure , the average price of silver pieces has approximately doubled . <P> The reasons are various . Unlike fine porcelain or glassware , silver is rugged enough to be used on the dining table . George I coffeepots go for as high as $15,000 and George II candlesticks for $3,000 , largely because any host can not only use them , but be more than proud to display them . ( What housewife dares entrust to a maid , or even herself , the washing of a Ming plate or a Meissen cup ? ) Some private collectors are charmed by the nostalgia that exudes from an emblazoned baronial crest , enchanted by the social history implicit in a snuffbox and fascinated by the expertise needed to decipher the silversmith 's hallmarks . <P> Mystique of Style . Inflation only enhances the upward sweep of prices , since many silver collectors buy as a hedge against it . Devaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward like startled fawns . Then , of course , there is the whole mystique of style . Most congenial to the eyes of modern collectors is the gracefully severe Queen Anne style , which was developed by French Huguenots who fled across the Channel to England to escape religious persecution in 1685 . The rococo elegance of mid-18th century English designers like Paul de Lamerie has an extravagant appeal of its own . The robust baroque styles of the 17th century are rarer , but in some ways the most memorable of all . Last November , two James II tankards , delicately chased with drawings of posturing Chinese potentates , fetched $134,400 at Christie 's in London . Since the tankards had last changed hands in 1963 at a price of $47,600 , mathematicians calculated that they had been appreciating at a rate of $1.80 per hour .
