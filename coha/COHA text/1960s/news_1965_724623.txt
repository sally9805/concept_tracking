txt What 's ahead ... The faction-ridden Congo will go to the polls sometime between March 15 and April 30 . Leftist rebels continue to strive to overthrow the government of Premier Moishe Tshombe . But they are largely concentrated in a pocket in northeast Congo . However , many nations in the 36-member Organization of African Unity are openly opposing Mr. Tshombe . Some are even helping arm the rebels . The Congo government is believed to be recruiting more mercenaries to counter this . To further complicate the picture , there are 223 political parties in the Congo . Mr. Tshombe has succeeded in uniting 49 of them into a single front behind his candidacy . He will probably win the election . But it wo n't mean the end of strife in the Congo . 0 Austria is knocking at the door of the Common Market . The market 's six nations  --  known as the European Economic Community ( EEC ) ? will take the matter up March 19 . If Austria is admitted as an associate member it may set a precedent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , competitive , industrial economy to associate with the EEC . Greece and Turkey are associates . But they are not exporting nations , and therefore not competitors . Austrian businessmen press for EEC membership because their best customers are among the Common Market countries . If admitted , Austria would not run into the EEC 's high external tariff wall . Letting Austria associate might evoke a Soviet protest . Moscow has already said such association would violate Austria 's neutrality pledge . Top government officials in Vienna expect , however , that the Kremlin will not go beyond diplomatic protests . Trends ... Militant communism is finding an increasingly snug harbor in the Moslem world . In the recent elections in the Indian state of Kerala , pro-Chinese Communists won a quarter-million votes ? 10 seats . Some of these were wrested from the Moslem League itself . This has triggered Hindu concern . Observers see Kerala as a symptom of a larger emerging pattern . India , the world 's third-largest Islamic country , has 50 million Moslems , a potentially rich harvest for communism . The Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 million members , plus a youth organization of 1.5 million . Indonesia has been veering increasingly left . In Pakistan , the largest Islamic nation in the world , the Communist Party is outlawed . But up to 1954 when it became illegal it had 380,000 members . And Pakistani President Ayub Khan just returned from a roaring welcome in Peking . As communism continues to set baits throughout the Arab world , this pattern of Moslem procommunism also worries the West . How and why ... Behind almost every challenge to the West in Asia for 15 years has lurked Communist China . The ultimate challenge in Korea in 1950 was from China . The threat in the background in Vietnam today is from China . The open attack in India came from China and there now is renewed danger on that border . Two things happened in Southeast Asia after World War II . First , the British , French , and Dutch colonial empires collapsed . Second , an ambitious Communist regime took over on the China mainland . On the one side a vacuum was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill it . New underdeveloped nations suddenly independent were left exposed . An alarmed United States saw the Communist danger and rushed in with economic and military props . It fought and maneuvered to hang on until a barrier of nations strong enough to resist communism could form . Communist China just as doggedly sought to supplant American influence . That process still goes on . But it has become harder for the United States for two reasons : First , China is growing stronger . Many of its Asian neighbors lean its way simply because it is nearer and they are convinced it , not the United States , is the coming dominant power in Asia . Second , when the United States arms one Asian country against communism , it oftens irks another . When it helps South Vietnam , it alienates Cambodia . When it rushes aid to India , Pakistan protests . Washington for many months has seen negotiation as an acceptable solution . Its major effort now is to get to the bargaining table in a strong position .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
