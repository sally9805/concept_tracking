txt The Republican platform committee approved today " a liberal plank calling for a new Governmentindustry approach toward resolving " the crisis of the cities . " The plank pledges new efforts to solve urban problems , ranging from housing to mass transit , from unemployment to air and water pollution . The recommendations are mot specific . The plank accepts the need for Federal action but lays considerable stress on enlisting private industry to provide jobs and housing in the slums . Economic incentives , such as tax credits , are proposed to attract private capital and investment . Conservatives Make Bid Outmaneuvered and outnumbered on the urban plank , a vocal Southern conservative bloc sought to stiffen a moderately worded plank on crime and violence . As presented to the full Committee on Resolutions , the proposed plank on crime and violence stresses that the law be obeyed while steps are taken to eliminate the causes of crime and violence . Throughout a day of haggling over amendments , conservatives unsuccessfully sought heavier emphasis on the need for forceful Government steps to put down violence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conservatives succeeded in incorporating an amendment specifying that " persons should be held accountable for their actions . " The liberals offset this with an amendment calling for a " just society " that would eliminate the causes of violence . At one point in midafternoon , when the conservative tide was running strong , supporters of Governor Rockefeller began dropping hints that they might file a minority report to the platform . The threat subsided when the tide turned toward the liberal side . The urban and crime planks reflected the ideological split developing within the Republican ranks over the direction the party should move on domestic issues . Oa the crime issue , with the encouragement of former Vice President Richard M. Nixon , the party appeared to be movI ing toward a right-of-center position . But on social welfare issues , under pressure from liberals and with the acquiesence of Mr. Nixon , the party leaned toward a moderate-to-liberal position . The urban plank was the first to be adopted by the 102 ? man committee as it moved tediously and with some dissension toward the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention Tuesday . The Republican National Convention opens Monday . The committee 's closed discussion in the Hotel Fontainebleau 's Voltaire Room was more often about semantics than substance and moved at such a slow pace that after an evening and long day of debate only one-fourth of the platform had been considered . ' We All ' or ' All of Us ' The members , for example , quarreled for seven minutes over whether the platform should read " we all " or " all of us " and for 30 minutes over whether " a " should be regarded as a prefix or a word . As the discussion dragged on , the platform grew  --  at the latest count it was more than 10,000 words  --  to the point where Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois , the Senate Republican leader who is the committee chairman , despaired of a relatively brief , " pungent " platform or of completing a draft by tomorrow . Senator Dirksen 's tactic was to let the members tire themselves out with talk and then reassert his leadership in pushing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decades that weariness is a wonderful weapon , " he confided to a discouraged aide . A series of amendments from conservative forces sought to modify moderate-to-liberal domestic planks drafted by Senator Dirksen and his nine  --  man executive committee . On the urban plank , however , liberals believed that they had scored a victory despite some weakening amendments . Conservatives succeeded in beating down a proposal that the Johnson Administration be criticized for ignoring recommendations of the National Advisory Commission on Civil disorders . Goodell Blocked The proposal , sponsored by Representative Charles E. Goodell of upstate New York , would have pledged the Republican party to pay close at- , tention to the commission 's recommendations for ending what it called a racially divided society . A commission recommenda tion was for tax credits to attract private capital into the slums . This was opposed by the Administration when it was advanced by Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Charles H. Percy , Republican of Illinois . Conservatives also defeated a proposal by Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York that the platform urge a " huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a phrase first suggested by John W. Gardner , former Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare in the Johnson Administration and now chairman of the Urban Coalition . To conservatives , such a phrase represented too much of an open-ended commitment Liberals succeeded in entitling the urban plank " Crisis of the Cities , " a name sponsored by Senator Javits . To liberals , the name ? as well as the tone of the plank ? reflected a recognition by the Republican party that a crisis existed in the cities and a commitment by . the party to do something about it . With domestic issues out of the way , major fights were expected to develop over the trade plank , which currently has a strongly protectionist tone , and the Vietnam issue . In the last few days , according to committee members , the Vietnam plank has been stiffened to place the party on record in support of the American commitment in Southeast Asia . Supporters of Governor Rockefeller are preparing substitute planks asking a negotiated settlement .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
