A dozen years ago , Critic John Mason Brown defined television as chewing gum for the eyes . Now the record industry has come up with bubble gum for the ears . Set to a chink-a-chink beat , bleated out with pep-rally fervor , it goes like this : <P> Yummy , yummy , yummy , I got love in my tummy , And I feel like a-lovin ' you ; Love , you 're such a sweet thing , good enough to eat thing , And that 's just a-what I 'm gon na dooooo . <P> Bubble-gum music is the latest confection created for the subteen market , which accounts for about one out of every four single records sold . These customers , who range from high school freshmen all the way down to third-graders , are the displaced persons of the rock revolution . Today 's groups sing about such everyday teen-age concerns as war , alienation , racism and narcotics . But to quite a few subteens , especially the more sheltered ones , having a social conscience means worrying about getting home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necking , and the byword is do n't trust anybody over 13 . <P> Bubble-gum music speaks to them of their own concerns , or rather unconcerns . Since they are at the awkward age , midway between playing house for fun and playing it for real , the music shrewdly looks both ways , combining nursery rhymes with sex . In May I Take a Giant Step ( into Your Heart ) , the lines go : <P> I remember how it started . . . All the kids were out to play , Then she said , " Hey , let 's play ' May I. ' " On a forthcoming record , a group called the Salt Water Taffy chants Sticks &; Stones : Nothing you could say could ever make me leave her . . . . Save your breath ' cause I 'm ignoring , But do n't forget it 's me that 's scoring . <P> Simon Says . The bubble-gum trend has been puffed up largely by a 25-year-old former actor and rock-'n ' - roll singer named Neil Bogart . Last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he set the formula with a recording called Simon Says . It sold 1,700,000 copies . The latest in a line of 28 similar disks is Yummy , Yummy , Yummy , by the Ohio Express , which last week was No. 15 on Billboard 's bestseller chart of 100 . <P> In all , Buddah has piled up first-year sales of $5,800,000 and has already grown to be the nation 's seventh largest producer of single records . <P> Now other groups and labels are cashing in on the same market , including the Cowsills on MGM ( Indian Lake ) and Manfred Mann on Mercury ( My Name Is Jack ) . But Buddah and Bogart hold the original charter . " We are giving kids something to identify with that is clean , fresh and happy , " Bogart says . " Let them worry about the world 's problems when they get older . " <P> Fair enough . But many parents will find more reason than rhyme in the lyrics of Bubble-Gum World : <P> You think you 're in a bubble-gum world . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going a little insane .
