Kenya 's 65,000 white inhabitants , already bitter over Britain 's repeated concessions to the colony 's black nationalists , had more to swallow last week . They had accepted an increased political role for the Africans in the hopes that moderates would come to power and learn gradually the art of governing . But after eight years in prison and exile , extremist Jomo ( " Burning Spear " ) Kenyatta , the organizer of the Mau Mau terror , proved himself once again the most powerful man in Kenya . <P> Kenyatta , who says his age is about 70 , has been confined to the desert village of Lodwar since his release from prison two years ago . Kenya 's British Governor Sir Patrick Renison refused to grant Kenyatta full liberty and refused to let him return to politics . But eleven African political leaders flew to Lodwar from Nairobi last week to ask Kenyatta a question . Should they cooperate with the British in putting into e " ect Kenya 's new constitution ( its third since 1954 ) , under which the Africans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's answer : accept no half measures , fight on for full independence . <P> Jomo has a personal stake in the struggle : his own freedom . Governor Renison - who once described Kenyatta as " a leader to darkness and death " - has agreed to move Jomo soon to a more pleasant location in the Kenya highlands , but still in confinement . In London , British Colonial Secretary Iain Macleod backed Renison 's stand in Parliament . <P> Unmoved by all this , Kenya 's biggest African party , the K.A.N.U. , led by James Gichuru and Tom Mboya , vowed to sabotage the new constitution until Kenyatta gets his freedom . Both Gichuru and Mboya now refer to Kenyatta as " our national leader , " openly profess their intention of installing him as Kenya 's first African prime minister . In part , this deference to Jomo is dictated by fear of the almost godlike status which 30 years of nationalist struggle has won Kenyatta among Kenya 's black masses . <P> Despite Kenyatta 's intransigence , the British still cling to the hope that Kenya 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be persuaded to participate in the new Kenya government . But the realistic prospect is that no African faction will dare oppose Kenyatta 's wishes for long . The Africans who visited him last week insist that , contrary to earlier reports , Jomo is neither ill , feeble nor alcoholic . Recently , he produced a child by his young third wife , who shares his Lodwar cabin . Said Tom Mboya : " I can assure people who consider that his age has impaired him mentally and physically that they are quite wrong . For the Europeans , this is the end to their wishful thinking .
