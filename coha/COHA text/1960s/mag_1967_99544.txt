Be honest  --  what do you think of when you think of an umpire ? An argument , right ? A ballplayer and an umpire standing nose to nose yelling at each other with the crowd booing  --  and if you think the one they 're booing is the player , then you have n't been to a ball game lately . In baseball the umpire is always the villain . // I 'd like to know where that got started . I know booing is Part of the Game and The American Way and all that . But why is it ? Who started it ? Who was the first guy who booed the umpire and called him a blind bat and yelled , " Kill the ump ! " I wish I could find him . I 'd tell him a few things . // Maybe a lot of it is in good humor , but you ought to see some of the people who wait for an umpire after a game just to abuse him . You ought to hear the nice things they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some players and managers are pretty good with that stuff , too . I know one thing  --  you never hear a compliment , though baseball without umpires is nothing . They could n't play the game without us. // Umpires are abused , insulted , underpaid and overtraveled , yet they expect an umpire to have a perfect temperament at all times . If some lug starts spouting filthy insults and an umpire gets a little hot under the collar , oh , is n't that terrible . He 's lost control of the game , they say . He does n't have the right attitude . Listen , if they can find a fellow who can swallow all that stuff , then they do n't have an umpire . When you 're out on the field umpiring , you 're dealing with professionals you know and admire . I respected the ground that a ballplayer walked on , and I respected the player himself . I never cursed a ballplayer in all the years I was an umpire . I had no right to and no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no right to . And they had no right to curse me or call me any of those names . I know all those names , and I 'm none of them . I respected the players , but in turn I demanded respect from them . And I got it . The ballplayer has to respect the umpire . You ca n't take abuse from a player , because that is when you lose control of the game . // They say a squabble with the umpire lends color to baseball . All right , I agree . I do n't object to an argument . In fact , I kind of like one occasionally . I like a ballplayer who fights for his rights . It shows that he takes the game seriously , that it means a lot to him . But that does n't have anything to do with him calling me a foul name . It does n't have anything to do with the phony arguments and rotten abuse you get from some of these so-called colorful characters . Like Leo Durocher. // Durocher ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues for five seasons and in the National League for 25 , and I never saw anyone else like him . He is the king of the complainers , the troublemakers , the malcontents , the ones who can never , never , never accept a tough decision that goes against them . // There are n't very many of them , thank the Lord . I do n't mean the fellows who get in an occasional argument and get thrown out of a game once in a while . That happens . That 's part of baseball . I mean the ones who are always bickering , always making trouble , who seem to go out of their way to stir things up , the ones who play to the crowd to get the fans down on the umpire . There are only one or two on a team at the most , but they can make an umpire 's life hell . // Durocher was the worst in my experience . He 's two-faced . He jumps you one minute , and the next minute he comes up oozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fool me . I 've known him too long . Great umpire ! He never bothered to call me a great umpire when I made a good call against his team . You 'd get nothing but trouble then . // I remember back in the early ' 40s when he was managing the Brooklyn Dodgers and he swore at me and kicked dirt on me at home plate because of a decision I made , and it was the right decision . // The Dodgers and Chicago Cubs were tied 1-1 with the Dodgers batting in the bottom of the sixth inning . Bobby Bragan walked and Goody Rosen was hit by a pitch . With two out , Frenchy Bordagaray hit a long single to center . // Now , Bragan was one of the slowest base runners I ever saw , and Rosen was n't much faster . Ordinarily you would have put in a pinch runner for Bragan . As little as I think of Durocher , there is no question in my mind but that he was a first-class manager . If only he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the best managers of all time . But this was during the war and Durocher did n't have enough players to maneuver with ; he needed Bragan in the ball game . When Bordagaray hit that shot to the outfield , Bragan tried to score from second . Well , here he came lumbering home with what should have been a run , and there was Rosen racing for third . The throw went in to third base , and they got Rosen for the third out of the inning . // I was umpiring at the plate and , naturally , I did n't call the play at third . That was the base umpire 's decision , and nobody made any objection to it . But as plate umpire I had to see whether Bragan touched home plate before Rosen made the third out , and Bragan didn't. // Everybody in the ball park was watching the play at third base , so no one saw me signal that the run did not score . They have all sorts of telephones and public address systems now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitutions and rulings on plays like this to the official scorer by shouting up to him in the press box . I turned and waved my arms and screamed , " The run does not score ! " // Durocher was on the lines coaching . He came running up to the plate and yelled , " You son of a bitch ! Did you say that run does n't score ? " I said , " It does n't score , " and I chased him out of the game for his language to me. // " Why , you lousy bastard , " he said , and he kicked dirt on me . There was always a lot of soft , granular dirt around home plate in Ebbets Field ; you were forever sweeping off the plate because just a kick of the foot could cover it with dirt . When he kicked dirt on me , he spattered me from head to foot . It was all over me . He kicked the dirt , and then he turned and went toward his dugout and I followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my coat , so I could n't take that off , but I tossed my mask away . That was kind of dumb on my part . If I was going to have a fight , I should have kept it on and let him break his hand against it . // I yelled , " Hey , turn around . " // He stopped and turned . // " Take a punch at me , " I said . I was boiling . // " Why ? " he said . // " So I can knock you out , " I said , " right here . " // He turned and kept going into the dugout . // Meantime , the fellows who ran the scoreboard thought the run had come in , and they put a big 1 up in the sixth inning for the Dodgers . When they put a run on the scoreboard in Ebbets Field it did n't matter whether it counted or not . That was their run . Never mind how it got there . It was theirs . // But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up instead . When the run came down , so did everything else in the stands : sandwiches , pickles , hunks of salami , tomatoes . And bottles . There must have been at least a hundred bottles , all aimed at me . They called it a pop-bottle barrage in the papers , but all I saw was beer bottles . I was standing near home plate , and those bottles kept flying out of the stands . Charlie Grimm was managing the Cubs , and he came running up . // " You hardheaded Irishman , " he said , " get out to second base before you get hit with one of those bottles . " // I said , " I 'm staying here , watching the bottles . I 'm not running for anybody . " // I liked Charlie , but I did n't want just one manager coming out and standing there with me . That did n't look good . So I said , " If you do n't get out of here , you can join that other punk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and he ran like the devil for the Cub dugout . You remember how Charlie Grimm used to run , with that waddle , with his arms down straight and his hands spread ? That 's the way he ran . It was funny , and maybe that helped ease things , because after a while they stopped throwing bottles . Just about the same time four policemen appeared on the field and plenty more started moving throughout the stands , and I think maybe that had more to do with it . Either way , I was happy to see the bottles stop . It 's not a very comfortable feeling to be standing at home plate while people you do n't even know are throwing beer bottles at your head . ( They stopped selling beer and soda in bottles after that . I 'm the guy who put paper cups in the ball parks. ) // We got the game going again , and the Cubs scored a run in the seventh . That 's the way it ended , with the Cubs winning 2-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Ebbets Field the umpires used to get on and off the playing area through the field boxes down along the right-field line . That was so we would n't have to mingle with the players . I started down that way after the game ended , but the captain of police over there at that time , a big Irishman named Murphy , met me and said , " Come on , Jocko . We 'll go out this way . " Meaning through the Dodger dugout and down the runway that was fenced off from the crowd . // I said , " No , I 'm going out the way I came in . " I was a little stubborn , and I did n't want them to think I was scared . // Murphy was very patient . He smiled and said , " No , Jocko . We 're going this way . Now , I do n't want you to worry about a thing . There 'll be policemen outside , and you 'll have nothing to worry about . " He led me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the umpires ' dressing room . I was working with George Barr and Dusty Boggess . The newspapermen came in and asked questions about the fuss , and I never in all my career closed my door to the newspapermen . I always gave them an answer , and they were pretty fair to me . One or two I did n't like , but most of them were fair . Answering their questions delayed me in getting dressed . I was just taking off my second shin guard when Barr and Boggess patted me on the back and said , " We 'll see you tomorrow , Jock . " And they were gone . // " I 'm alone , " I said to myself . " How could they get dressed so fast ? Or did they dress ? Did they go out of here in their umpires ' clothes ? " // I was alone , and I could hear the crowd still yelling and milling around outside the ball park . I got dressed , and I walked along to the rotunda , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . I was staying at the Astor Hotel in New York , and the way I went back there from Brooklyn was to walk three or four blocks to the station at Prospect Park and take the subway to Manhattan . There must have been 3,000 or 4,000 fans outside the ball park , just waiting for me , and I could n't see a policeman anyplace . I knew the crowd was waiting for me , because I could hear my name , and I could hear things like " that blind so-and-so . " It was June , and I had on a very handsome light-tan suit , a panama hat and brown-and-white shoes . I was kind of a dude then . I edged out , and finally I walked right through the middle of the crowd . None of them recognized me . They were looking for a guy in an umpire 's cap and a blue suit . // I walked down Sullivan Place toward Prospect Park . I was feeling sort of cocky , but then two bruisers started to move toward me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly , even though it was dark . They began to follow me . I started to walk faster , and they followed right along , maybe 20 or 30 feet behind me . I figured they were going to wait until I got to the subway , because it was a long way down those subway stairs and it would n't take much of a knock to send me all the way down them and ruin me . I looked for a cop , and I could n't see one . I thought , " Well , I 'm not going to let them get me on the subway steps , " and I turned around and faced them . I figured , let them try to get me up here ; at least I have a chance . They came toward me and I took a swing at one of them , but the other grabbed me . He handled me like a toy . He said , " Take it easy , Jocko . We 're policemen . The captain told us to keep an eye on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is , the whole point is , the entire situation was caused by Durocher . He could not accept the decision . It was his batter who got put out at third base . It was his base runner who was slow and failed to score before the third out . I did n't do any of it . I did n't prevent the run from scoring . I did n't put the run up on the scoreboard for the people to see , and I did n't take it down . All I did was call the play the way it happened , and ail Durocher did was cause all the trouble . Typical of him . Typical . // Durocher was definitely the alltime champion crybaby , but for most of the time I was umpiring he was a manager , not a player . The most difficult player I had to deal with was Jackie Robinson . // Jackie was one of those fellows who could never accept a decision . I give him credit for being an outstanding ballplayer . He was a dangerous hitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever saw in my life . He kept an umpire on his toes when he was running the bases , because he had such quick reflexes . He could slide either way , and he could feint you out at the last minute , the last second , the last instant . He could start one way and go another . He was like Ty Cobb that way . He was more like Cobb in temperament and style than any other player  --  very intense . But almost every time he was called out on strikes , or on a close play on the bases , there were a few words from him  --  the pitch was inside or the fielder missed the tag or he was n't on the bag . He wore you out . // Umpires were n't too crazy about Jackie . He had a rough tongue . I put him out of a game once in Philadelphia for calling me a name , and everybody was shocked . Not at Robinson , at me . I had done a terrible thing : I had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me did n't matter , I guess . It was n't the first time he had been thrown out , and it was n't the last . He could get an umpire 's goat . // I remember one time in Japan , when I was there with the Dodgers on a postseason tour . There was a little shortstop playing on one of the Japanese teams . Everybody liked him . He was forever bowing and saying , " Mushi-mushi , mushi-mushi ! " He had everybody saying mushi-mushi . He was a good little ballplayer ; he could run fast , he could field , he could throw pretty well . But he could not hit . He was an out man all the time : strike out , pop up , weak grounder. // Toward the end of the trip , one of the last games they played , this little shortstop came up with the bases empty , and he hit a ball down toward short to Pee Wee Reese . Pee Wee sort of took his time fielding it . He let it come to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ball before he threw it , and then he threw it not too hard to first . It was obvious that Reese was hoping the little guy would beat it out for a hit . And Gil Hodges at first base  --  a fine fellow and one of the finest-fielding first basemen I ever saw  --  instead of stretching for the throw , took it right on the bag , and maybe even on the wrong side of the bag , to give the guy more time . They still had him out by a step . // I called him safe . It was the only time in my career that I ever called a man safe when I knew he was out . He was such a fine little fellow , that shortstop . But Robinson , who was playing second base , came charging over at me , waving his arms and yelling about the guy being out by five feet and so forth . // I said , " Just play second base . " // He yelled , " Why do n't you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // He just galled me . Everybody else knew what was going on , and he did n't . I suppose it was because he was always such a competitor , but even so  --  // " You 're never in position , " he yelled . // " I 'm in a dandy position for you right now , " I said . " Get out ! " I chased him . // After the game I rode back to the hotel in the bus with the ballplayers , and as I walked down the aisle to my seat at least half a dozen guys , including Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella and Jim Gilliam , winked at me and smiled and nodded their heads . They all had a lot of respect for Jackie , but he wore them out once in a while , too . // Another thing happened with Robinson on that trip to Japan that I got a kick out of . I suppose I should n't have , because an umpire is supposed to be impartial , but it was so funny I enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and two , and first base was open . The Japanese manager stood up and pointed to first . In other words , walk him , make ball four intentional , give him the base . They feared Jackie  --  he was some hitter , especially in the clutch . The catcher moved out a little to one side and held his glove out wide . Everybody relaxed as the pitcher started to throw because we all knew it was going to be ball four . But the pitcher busted one right down the middle , hard , right through the gate ! They must have had a special signal . I do n't know , maybe they signaled with their teapot . They always had a teapot in the dugout instead of a water cooler . However they did it , the pitch was over the plate and the catcher hopped back in and caught it . Robinson was so surprised he just stood there . " Sneak attack ! " I yelled . " Strike three ! Another Pearl Harbor ! " // I had a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly because of Durocher and Robinson , I guess . But one of the worst hassles I ever got into was with Branch Rickey . It was just after Rickey had taken over at Brooklyn . Johnny Allen , a hot-tempered guy , was pitching for the Dodgers and Mickey Owen was catching . I was the plate umpire , and George Barr was umpiring at third base . Barr called a balk , and Allen blew his top . He ran over to Barr , yelling at him and grabbing at him , and Barr fell to his knees . I liked Johnny Allen  --  I played against him in the International League  --  but I yelled to Barr , " Hit him ! He 's got no right to put his hands on you . " George did n't swing , but Allen was thrown out of the game and later was suspended for 30 days . // After that game was over , Rickey sent Arch Murray , a New York sportswriter , into the umpires ' room to talk to me . Arch was a nice little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a pigeon for the ball club . Rickey sent him in and he had Murray ask me , " On that play why did you shake your head and tell Owen it was n't a balk ? " // I said , " What are you talking about ? " // Murray said , " When Barr called the balk , you shook your head . " // " Get out of here , Arch , " I said . I opened the door and ushered him through it . // He said , " Jocko , we 're still friends , are n't we ? " // " Yes , " I said . " Sure . But do n't give me that baloney . " And I closed the door . // I got dressed , and when I left the dressing room Rickey was there waiting for me . He was angry . // " Young man , " he said in that big voice of his , with his eyebrows hanging down over his face . " Young man , when Barr called that balk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balk , and you shook your head no. " // I said , " I did not . " // He said again , " Owen asked you if you saw Allen balk , and you said no. " // " I did not , " I said . // Now , it was true that I shook my head when Owen asked me , but not because I thought Barr had made a mistake . What I meant when I shook my head was that I had n't seen a balk  --  not that there had n't been one . A plate umpire adjusts his mask and crouches to get ready for the pitch , and he looks down at the plate to get his bearings . He takes his eye off the pitcher for an instant . That 's why we had three umpires  --  three then , four now . If Barr called a balk , Allen balked. // " You are a liar , " Rickey said . // " Do n't you tell me I 'm lying , " I said . " You are making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snapped , " Good night , " and he left . // That thing stayed with me . I could n't sleep . Rickey was a big man in the league ; and I 'd only been an umpire in it for two or three seasons . But , I thought , I ca n't umpire if a man calls me a liar . // The next day , early , I went to Owen and I said , " Mickey , did I tell you that Allen did n't balk ? " // " No , " he said . // " What did we say to each other ? " // " I asked you if you saw the balk , and you said no. " // " But did I say he had n't balked ? " // " No. " // I said , " Mickey , would you vouch for that with Branch Rickey ? It 's kind of a hard thing to ask you to do . " // He said , " Jock , I believe in telling the truth . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell Rickey the truth . " // Barr and some others knew what I was doing , and they said , " Do n't . You 're only making trouble for yourself . You could lose your job . " // " I do n't need the job that bad , " I said . // Before the game began Rickey came down and sat in his box , and I walked over to him . I was still in my street clothes , and I said , " Do you know me , Mr. Rickey ? " Sometimes people do n't recognize umpires in street clothes . // " Yes , " he said . " I know you . " // " You owe me an apology , " I said . // " I do ? " And the eyebrows went up . // " Yes , you do , " I said . " You interpreted that balk thing yesterday entirely differently from the way it happened . You owe me an apology for the remarks you made to me . And if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // He gave me a long look , and then he said , " Young man , you are 100% right . I found out today from Owen . I was wrong . I apologize . " // " Thank you . That 's all I want , " I said . // I walked back and found Owen . // " Thanks , Mickey , " I said . And I meant it . He had gone out of his way to do an umpire a big favor . // Most ballplayers and managers do n't give an umpire trouble . In fact , some of the fellows I seemed to be having trouble with on the field were really a lot of fun , like Danny Murtaugh and Frank Frisch . I had big arguments with them and I tossed them out of games , but the arguments were never mean or vicious . When I chased Murtaugh or Frisch , it was usually because of some clowning thing they had done . I threw Frisch out of a lot of ball games , yet he never resented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of being chased so much . // Casey Stengel was a lot of fun on a ball field , too , though Casey could be pretty rough on umpires , and he meant to be rough . But Casey was a competitor all the way ; there never was anybody else like him . I played for him in the minor leagues in 1930 when he was managing Toledo , and he and I became good friends , real close friends . What a year that was ! Casey used to have a meeting with the players every morning . Games started at 3 in the afternoon . He 'd call the meetings at 10:30 , and those were the only meetings I can ever recall in baseball where the players got there early . Not just early , but an hour early , because Casey would n't wait until 10:30 to start talking . He started in the minute he got to the clubhouse , and nobody wanted to miss anything . // They talk about Casey and his conversations when he was managing the Yankees and the Mets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk through the clubhouse in his underwear and he 'd look around and he 'd say sweetly , " Are all my boys here ? " We 'd have lost the ball game the day before , and he 'd start in on what we had done wrong . He 'd give an exhibition of fielding and pitching and hitting and base running and everything ; he 'd go on and on and on . It was great . // He 'd get dressed as he talked . One day he finally had everything on except his pants . He had his shoes on and his socks rolled at the knee , and he had on his uniform shirt and his cap , and there were his bow legs sticking out of his underwear . It was a Sunday and we had a doubleheader , which started at 2:30 instead of 3 , and , I swear , Casey talked steadily , without stopping , from before 10 until a couple of minutes after 2. // That day he was getting on a player named Max Rosenfeld . Max could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against Rosy Ryan of Minneapolis , who had a beautiful curve . Casey was telling Max what he was doing wrong and what he should do right . // He 'd say , " Now , this is the way I did it in the National League . You stand there and you watch that pitcher and you cock the bat , and you lay for that curve ball . " Max Rosenfeld was nodding his head and saying , " Yes . O.K. All right . " // Max had on a light Palm Beach suit  --  he had n't had a chance to dress yet with Casey talking  --  and he was sitting right in front of Casey . There was a box filled with sawdust between them , a low box filled with chew tobacco and all the slop that guys who had been playing cards in the clubhouse had tossed into it . It was a mess , that sawdust box . But Casey was using it as an imaginary home plate as he explained to Max how to wait on the pitch and lay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Casey did it when he was playing ball . Casey said , " McGraw always told us to lean over . " And he leaned over that sawdust box . " And lay for it . " He cocked the bat and waited . " And then hit it ! " Wham ! Casey swung the bat and he smacked the box , and the sawdust and chew tobacco and slop flew up in the air and it all hit Max right in the Palm Beach suit , right down the front of it . Max jumped up , and he was almost crying . He said , " You can show me how to hit , but you do n't have to cover me with all that slop ! " Casey gave him a look , tossed the bat away and said , " Well . That 's the way I hit ' em . " // By then it was 2 o'clock and somebody said , " Time to warm up the pitchers , " so we had to go out on the field . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women in the park . From the dressing room we had to walk underneath the stands before we got to the runway that led to the dugout . Everybody filed out , and Casey came over and sort of growled out of the side of his mouth , " How did you like that exhibition of hitting ? " // " Oh , it was swell , " I said . " You really hit that curve ball . You nearly killed poor Max . He 's got to have his suit cleaned and everything now . " // Casey said , " Yeah , yeah . Well , if he hit those curve balls like that he would n't be having trouble with his suit . " // He started to go out of the dressing room and he said to me , " Take a couple of those things out with you , will you ? Take the ball bag . " // I picked up the ball bag and I followed him . He was carrying a couple of towels , I think , and a fungo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still did n't have his pants on , but I did n't say a word . I walked right along with him . We went out past the concession stands and along under the grandstands , and the women in the crowd were staring at Casey and saying , " Oh ! Oh my . " A couple of them called , " Casey ! Casey ! " // Stengel was walking along , swinging the fungo bat like a cane . He said , " They got some crazy women here in Toledo . " // I said , " Yes , I guess they do . " // We kept on walking , and the people watching us were making more and more commotion . Casey looked around and frowned , and he said , " What are they hollering about ? The game does n't even start for half an hour yet . " // And then he stopped . And he looked down . And he said , " Why , I have n't got my pants on . " // I just smiled at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungo bat , and he said , " Why did n't you tell me I did n't have any pants on ? " // " Why , Casey , " I said . " I did n't even notice . " // He hurried back inside and put his pants on , but when he went out on the field they were all yelling , " Casey ! Casey ! Where are your pants ? " // The women loved to yell at Casey , and he was great with them . One day in Milwaukee before a game we were crossing the field to the visitors ' dugout . They really liked him in Milwaukee because it 's a German town , and Casey is a Dutchman , you know . His nickname was Dutch before it was Casey . He had some telegrams in his hand , wires about players and notifications from the league office and things like that , and he was glancing at them as we crossed toward the dugout . The women in the stands were shouting to him and yelling his name , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey ! Der telegram . Vot did it said ? " We were right in front of our dugout by then . He looked up and said , " Just another widow died and left Old Case $10,000 more . " He ducked down into the dugout and said , " That 'll take care of those old gals up there . " // I did n't have much of a season for Casey because I hurt my ankle . He used to tell about that later on , and the story got better and better . We were in the ninth inning of a tie game , and Casey said , " I 'll buy a suit of clothes for the man who wins this game for me . " I got hold of one , and I stretched it into a triple . I slid hard into third , and when I did I hit my ankle . Oh , it hurt . Casey was coaching at third , and he bent over me. // " Are you hurt ? " he said . " I 'll put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right . I do n't need a runner . " // The next batter hit a long fly , and I tagged up and went in and scored the winning run . And boy , that ankle hurt then . I barely made it to home plate and then I fell flat on my face . They carried me into the clubhouse , and someone said the ankle was broken . // " Jocko , " Casey said . " You 're tough . " // " Never mind that , " I said . " Where 's the suit ? " // Every time Casey saw me , in a World Series or an All-Star Game or in spring training , he 'd tell that story . He 'd be giving that doubletalk to the newspapermen and I 'd come out on the field and he 'd say , " There 's my boy . There 's one of my boys . Now look at that . There 's a boy scored from third for me on a broken leg . " It was a chipped bone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit , and I had to hobble home , but with Casey it went from a chipped bone in the ankle to a broken leg , and I think some days he had a piece of broken bone sticking through my stocking . But that was all right with me , because I never did get that suit from him . When I reminded him , he said , " Ah , that 's the way you 're supposed to play for me. " // Casey could be funny , but when it came to winning or losing he was never a clown . He was dead serious , though a lot of fans never realized that . It 's strange how mistaken fans can be about some ballplayers and managers . Some have a reputation with fans for being nice guys , and others have a reputation for being real bums . Sometimes the fans are right . There never was a nicer fellow than Stan Musial , and Gil Hodges was a prince . But there were others who got a bad rap . // Ted Williams , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoot him , boo him , drive him to distraction . And yet I would say that there has never been a ballplayer who behaved better toward umpires than Ted Williams . You 'd think a man like Williams , who was supposed to be tense and irritable and high-strung , would blow up when he got a bad call at the plate , particularly since he knew the strike zone perfectly . He knew it better than any other ballplayer . Yet he 'd never say a word . He never complained . // I met Ted Williams when he was a minor league player with the Boston Red Sox farm team at Minneapolis . I was working in the American Association , and I had been assigned to Minneapolis for spring training . That was a strange setup . Here I was an umpire , and they had me rooming with a ballplayer , a kid named Robert Robertshaw , a left-handed pitcher . This was in Daytona Beach . Williams had just been assigned to the team , and he was in the next room to ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in bed sleeping one morning , my face pushed down into the pillow , and Williams came into our room and jumped on top of me. // " Get up , Bush , " he said . " Let 's go ! " He always called people " Bush , " all through his career . // I pushed him off and rolled over and said , " Get out of here , you big skinny punk . What 's the idea of jumping on me ? " // " You 're not Bush , " he said . " You 're not even a ballplayer . You 're too old to be a ballplayer. " // " Who are you ? " I said . // " I 'm Ted Williams , " he said . " I hit 23 home runs in San Diego . I 'll hit 40 home runs in this league . " // " You better wait till the league gets started . Maybe you wo n't even be here . " // " Is that so ? You watch me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit 43 that year . // I liked him , right from the beginning . He seemed awfully cocky , but he was a nice kid . I was in the hotel one morning when Mike Kelly called me . He owned the Minneapolis ball club . This was my first year umpiring in that league , but I knew Mike from having played ball in the Association . // " I want you to come out and take a look at a boy we have . Tell me what you think of him . " I went out with Mike to watch morning practice . The ball park was n't the one in Daytona Beach that 's near the ocean . It was back inside someplace , and it had a tremendous long fence . Williams came up in batting practice , and he hit three or four balls out of that park that looked as though they were shot out of a cannon . // " How do you like him ? " Mike whispered . // " He 's something , " I said . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " Yes , he 'll do , " Mike said . " He 's great now , but he 's going to be greater . " // Mike and Ted had a warm feeling for each other , a mutual admiration society . But Donie Bush , the Minneapolis manager , could n't stand it when Ted would walk after a ball in the outfield  --  which he would do now and then . Williams was such a wonderful hitter that the crowd always expected him to hit , every time . That went on all through his career . Whenever he made out , they booed him . I know that at Minneapolis he could hit home runs his first two times at bat , but if he struck out or popped up the third time the crowd would get on him . He was just a young kid , and his feelings would be hurt . If a ball was hit to him in the outfield the next inning , he 'd walk after it . I saw Donie Bush pull him right out of a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donie in , and he said , " Do n't you ever take that boy out of a ball game again . You ca n't take a player like him out . Where will we ever see another like him ? " // Then Mike got hold of Frank Bowman , the trainer , who later worked with the Giants , and he said , " Tell the boy I want to see him . " When Ted came up to his office , instead of bawling him out about walking after the ball Mike put his arm around his shoulders and said , " You know , I used to do the same thing when I was a kid . " And he would talk so gently and so skillfully that by the time Ted left the office he was practically crying . Williams often told me , " There was nobody else ever like Mike . " // They had a special promotion one night in Minneapolis . They called it Centennial Night , and they had 13,000 people there in that old Nicollet Field . How they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hanging from the eaves . Oh , it was jammed . Williams hit two home runs , and they were tremendous . They landed on the building across the street from the outfield fence . And then in the last of the ninth he came to bat with the bases loaded , two out and Minneapolis behind by a run . The count went to three and two . I was umpiring behind the plate . The crowd was yelling for another home run , or any kind of a base hit , or even a walk to force in the tying run . And I ended the ball game by calling Williams out on strikes on a pitch right at his knees . // Donie Bush was coaching at third base , and he came running in. // " Strike ! " he yelled . " It was down by his ankles . It was on the ground . " A low pitch is always on the ground , and a high one is always over his head . The crowd was furious . Bush was yelling at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I 'll never forget , and it is one of the reasons I consider him a close friend of mine in baseball . He looked at Donie Bush and he shook his head . // " No , Donie , " he said . " It was a good pitch . It was a perfect strike , right at the knees . I should have hit it . " // I could have thrown my arms around him . // I walked off the field and I thought , " What a man that is . " I never had anyone else in my career do anything like that . // Another time , in the 1947 All-Star Game , I called Williams out on strikes again . It was in the Cubs ' park in Chicago . I think Ewell Blackwell was pitching , and I called Ted out on a low pitch , a bad pitch . As soon as I called it , I knew I had made a mistake . The pitch was too low . I should have called it a ball . Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch in an All-Star Game . You know what he did ? He put his bat on his shoulder , and he walked away . He did n't say anything . // I 've always felt bad about calling that one wrong on Williams , but he never said a word to me about it . All through his career , for all his temperament and his difficulties with the fans and the press , he had the same reputation with umpires that Stan Musial had . I 'd ask American League umpires , " What kind of a guy is this Williams ? " To a man , they said , " Jock , he 's the greatest . " He never complained . He never argued , not a word . // An umpire has to go for a man like that . I remember talking to George Moriarty once before I ever umpired or even thought of it . Moriarty was from my neighborhood in Chicago , and he was an American League umpire . Earlier he had been both a player and a manager in the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mix with the ballplayers . I do n't waste my time talking to them . If you had this job you would n't talk to them either . It 's the only way you can get respect . " // After , when I was an umpire myself and I had had a hard time with some player , I 'd remember what Moriarty said , and I 'd think , " You know , he 's right . I 'm not going to talk to any of them anymore . The hell with them . " But it is n't in a man 's nature to be silent . It 's not silence that gets respect from the players . It 's working hard and knowing your job and doing your best and not taking any cheap abuse . It 's being in charge . You are the authority . You take command . You run the game . That 's all there is to it . // Sounds easy , does n't it ? But then you do n't know Leo Durocher.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
