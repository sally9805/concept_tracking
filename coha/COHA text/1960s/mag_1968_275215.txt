W. Preston Battle , criminal court judge in Tennessee 's Shelby County , is determined to keep the trial of James Earl Ray from turning into a courtroom circus . To make sure , Battle has issued a code of procedure that , among other things , prohibits any prejudicial , out-of-court discussion of the case by the principals . Last week , with the trial of Martin Luther King 's alleged assassin still more than a month away , Battle made it clear that he meant what he said . He not only found Ray 's lawyer and private detective guilty of contempt , but he issued contempt citations against two Memphis newsmen . <P> What touched off the jurist 's wrath was the behavior of Defense Attorney Arthur J. Hanes Sr. Hanes has not only talked to the press about the possibility of a Communist conspiracy in the King murder , but has also complained bitterly about the sheriff 's unusually strict guard over Ray . Some of his protests were dutifully echoed by Defense Detective Renfro Hays . Like good courthouse reporters anywhere , Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memphis Commercial Appeal printed the complaints . <P> Ray 's Rights . No one denies that Ray is being guarded with extraordinary zeal . Since his extradition from England last July , he has been kept in a third-floor cell in the Memphis courthouse , watched over by two ever-present deputies . Eight bright mercury-vapor lamps burn at all times . Two closed-circuit TV cameras are always trained on the cell . Except when Ray is conferring with his lawyer , a microphone listens in . Only one other murder suspect in the U.S. is currently being held under such strict security provisions . That man is Sirhan Sirhan , who will stand trial in Los Angeles for the murder of Robert Kennedy . <P> Hanes has protested what he called the " cruel and unusual punishment " of his client . But at last week 's hearing , Judge Battle saw no violation of Ray 's rights . He described the security measures as " reasonable . " Even more exasperating to the judge was the defense 's out-of-court suggestion that Ray 's sanity may be in danger . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes a clear and present danger " to picking an impartial jury and holding a fair trial . Certainly , the state 's case might be damaged if any jurors felt that Ray had been driven out of his mind . As for the lights , Battle said that Ray could buy a sleeping mask for his eyes . Looking squarely at the prisoner , who appeared healthy enough , Battle said : " Ray has been sleeping more than I have lately . "
