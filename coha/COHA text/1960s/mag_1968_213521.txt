HUBERT HUMPHREY began swinging hard-at last , said his friends . <P> When antiwar hecklers interrupted him outside Cleveland , the Vice President dismissed them as " damn fools . " He introduced Emmett Kelly , the clown , as " Nixon 's campaign manager and economic adviser . " Pointing to a nearby statue of William McKinley , he sniped : " That represents as much forward movement as the opposition 's ever had . " When Humphrey loosed a fusillade at Nixon during an A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Minneapolis , a happy worker bellowed : " Give ' em hell , Hubie ! " Answered the Vice President : " What do you think I 'm doing ? " <P> Humphrey 's tone is calculated to evoke memories of Harry Truman 's bruising 1948 campaign against Thomas E. Dewey . Whatever ground Humphrey may have gained with it last week , however , was not quite enough to endanger his underdog status . The Vice President remained an astonishingly inconsistent campaigner . At times on the stump he could be inspiring and almost pithy-a quality at odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph , he could sound again like a political calliope , cliches ablast . " Government of the people , for the people and by the people , " he told one audience , " is as American as apple pie . " <P> Humphrey also suffered from some bizarre campaign scheduling . During a two-day swing through California , he spent fully four hours at conservative Pepperdine College in Los Angeles . " If we had gone to U.C.L.A. , " explained an aide , " we would have been in for uncontrollable rudeness or total indifference . " Thus he was spared the heckling of student militants , but he was also spared exposure to crowds of voters . He expended two valuable hours at Leisure World , a housing complex for the elderly in Seal Beach , where Comedian Jimmy Durante introduced him as " Hoi-but Humphrey . " The residents were undoubtedly pleased when he advocated a 50% across-the-board increase in social security payments , but that gratification soon evaporated as he rambled garrulously on for nearly an hour under a broiling 98 sun . <P> Dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his campaign still has an air of nervous uncertainty about it . Well it might . Grave problems of financing and organization persist . The Vice President 's financial sources dried up after Robert Kennedy 's assassination ; many of his backers had contributed out of their fear of R.F.K. 's attitudes toward businessmen . Only recently have the funds begun to flow again , mostly from New York . While Nixon has jammed prime-time with television announcements , Humphrey plaintively told California students last week : " I have n't been able to afford a TV ad since last Aug. 20 , so help me God .
