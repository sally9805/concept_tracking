txt A million city residents and half a million commuters would not have the chore of filling out city income tax ' orms under a plan that Mayor Lindsay believes would save the city $1.5-million in administrative costs . Any city resident whose annual income is less than S6,000 end all of it is in wages , would not have to file a city tax return , the Mayor said yesterday . Any commuter whose city earnings tax has been deducted from his salary , regardless of how large it is. would also be excused from filing a return . Both would continue , however , to pay a city income or earnings tax at the same rates . But the amount already with- , held by their employers is so close to their final tax that the city has decided it would not . be worth the administrative , effort to collect the difference . Mr. Lindsay in a statement , announcing the plan , said the Legislature would have to make a " slight modification " in the city 's tax laws to permit the exemptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to accomplish this , and that he was confident it would be passed in time to apply to the 1966 returns . Tax Status Unchanged Finance Administrator Roy M. Goodman , the author ( If the plan , emphasized that the exemption would be only on the filing of returns , and would not change the tax status of the two groups . They would only be spared the task of filling out another form , in addition to those they must complete for Federal and state income taxes , he said . However , if they wished to claim rebates on what has already been deducted , they would have to file returns . " We tried to make our original tax form short and simple , and then we made it even shorter , " he continued . " Then it occurred to us , maybe there is a whole group of taxpayers who would n't have to fill out a form at all , and the city would still receive the revenue they provide . " We said we were trying to do everything to simplify this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will serve as the aspirin . " I It is estimated that . about a million city residents earning 6.000 or . less , all from wages , would be affected by the plan . About 500,000 commuters would be affected . Mr. Goodman has estimated that it Will cost the city about In to process each tax return . 1The projected saving of $1.5. - million would be equal to al ! most a quarter of the expected cost of collecting the city income and earnings taxes each year . Late last month the city mailed more than three million tax forms and instruction books to residents . Those who would be eligible under the $6,000 plan may ignore these , Mr. Goodman said , if the Legislature approves the change . The Others Must File He stressed , however , that any city resident or commuter who earns money other than wages , or who has a second job with a salary from which the city tax has not been deducted , must file a return . Commuters working in New York City who earn additional money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt from city taxes on these sources . But any commuter who is self-employed at work done in the city must file a return . So must any city resident who is self-employed , even if he makes ' less than $6,000 a year . It is estimated that a married resident with two children who earns $6,000 in wages alone has about $15.60 deducted each year by his employer . The total tax he owes the city would be about $15.60 . So . the city has already collected virtually all of the tax this man would have to pay and a tax return would not significantly change the final amount , Mr. Goodman explained , The city had originally planned to distribute tax forms to commuters by placing them in train and bus stations , and in city banks . Under the new plan , only about 100.000 commuters will have to fill out returns . Therefore , the forms will be placed only in the banks . Mr. Goodman said .

But neither the Legislature nor the Governor has shown any interest in this request . It has been estimated that the city will have to spend between $6-million and . $8-million in administrative costs to collect an ? estimated $l50-million in city income and commuter earnings taxes . Mr. Goodman warned yesterday that the proposed exemption from filing returns would not make it easier for a nonsalaried city earner or commuter to avoid paying taxes . " Our auditing lists are very good and it will not be any easier to cheat . " he said .
