was only happy when he was bedeviled by constant interruptions , faced with an enormous correspondence which must be dealt with immediately , hounded by an insistent phone ringing just as he was rushing from the office for an ap/pointment to which he was already late , wrestling with an impossibly crowded appointment pad and overpowered by the feeling that he was being whirled helplessly in a Gargantuan washing machine . Of course , it was against all the tenets of executive efficiencyfor a top man to have such a crowded desk . He was a poor delegator . Everyone in the office knew it . It was a carryoverfrom the early days when the staff had been so small that he had been obliged to do almost everything himself if he wanted it done right ( or at all ) . Later he rationalized his weakness by saying that a man could delegate work to a point where he only participated in the business by drawing his salary , but all he needed to do to prove the fallacy of this statement was to sit at Gleason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you get rid of some of this stuff ?

Now I 'm going to leave it to you . Whenever you see something that you think can be delegated , let me know . " That would silence her . She had been working beside him for so long that she knew that no one else had his personal touch , that no one else would take the pains to explain little things in words that inexperienced people could understand , that no one else could make the least-important customers feel that Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner existed to serve them and them alone . The idea that the business could be conducted without his touch was something that had never occurred to her any more than it had to Mr. Crombie.  |p101Every  so often , at officers ' meetings , he had been in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get rid of the unnecessarydetails .

" This was merely standard procedure  --  theory which he knew did n't work in practice , even while he preached it . When a man sat down at a bare desk to do constructive thinking , the odds were that he could n't think of anything constructive to think about and that he would end up wondering with whom he was lunching or whether his son , Sam , was ever going to make enough money at architecture to support four children . As " R " DAY DREW NEARER MR . Crombie began to realize more clearly what he was about to lose . Because he had built the business , because it was so much a part of him , it had never occurred to him that the deference he received from morning until night was for the job rather than its incumbent . This was not because he was egotistical ; he had just never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his big corner office for granted , as he had all the comfortable grooves in which his life was channeled . Now , as what the personnel men referred to as " the terminal date " drew near , things that he hadp102scarcely noticed up to this point suddenly began to acquire new values ; the familiar faces of the staff looking up and smiling at him as he passed , the obsequiousness of headwaiters , the pride in the junior officers ' voices when they introduced a prospective customer ( " I want you to meet our president , Mr. Crombie " ) , the requests to act as chairman of committees , the tiny minutiae of everyday business life which , like moisture particles , formed a fleecy cloud on which he had been borne unheeding these many years . The duties and obligations that he had complained of so bitterly suddenly began to appear in a new light now that he was about to be relieved of them .

So many of these activities had acquired an unrealized social quality . The men with whom he had sat through the years on charitable and commercial boards , who had worked with him on club committees , and on groups appointed to investigate and report on some hopeless muddle  --  had graduallybecome his friends . To some degree they had replaced his college and prebusiness connections . As long as he was the active head of a large , successful companynothing would change . It was becoming disturbingly evident , however , that on the day he retired his status would suddenly shift from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community , unwanted and unneeded , not because people did n't like him , but because their financial attachment was to Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner , the institution , rather than to Graham Crombie , the man . He fought against the despondency that these thoughts induced . He knew how irrational it was , how full of bathos and self-pity . What was about to happen to him was normal and proper , in his best interests as well as those of his company . He was moving into a life of greater self-expression where , for the first time , he would be free to follow whatever paths might interest him . But the black moods were hard to dispel . IN APRIL , AS THE FIRST SOFTbreezes of spring crept timidly through the shadowed canyons of the City , Mr. Crombie lost his nerve and bought the Highfieldhouse for the asking price . Well , Jinny had had her way . As time passed he even began to believe that this move to the country was something she had initiated and brought about . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said at breakfastthe following morning . " I know we should . We must , of course . I sort of dread it . " " Why , for heaven 's sake ? " " Oh , I do n't know . The children have been so queer about this whole idea of a country place . I was thinking about it lastp104night . When we first told them what we had in mind they scarcely made any comment . And from that day to this , not one of them has shown the least interest . It is n't like them . " " Now that you speak of it , that 's right , " said Mr. Crombie . " What do you suppose is the matter with them ? " " I do n't know , but I suspect they think we 've gone financiallyhaywire and that their future inheritance is being poured quietly down the drain . It 's just a hunch . Their reactionsare so uniform that I 'm sure they 've talked this over among themselves and being very well-mannered children they 've decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still and hope we do n't find any place we like . " Mr. Crombie laid down his paper irritably . " Listen , dear , we bought this place for ourselves  --  for you and me . We bought it after a lot of thought because you . . . because we both wanted to live in the country . " A pained look flitted across Mrs. Crombie 's face . She started to say something , then stopped . " We 're swinging into the last lap , " he continued , " and I want you to have what you want . " She wished he would n't keep referring to the " last lap " and the " last mile " all the time . She felt like the heroine of a cowboy ballad . " Let the children fight about our money when we 're gone . We 've bought a beautiful place and if they do n't like it they need n't come . " " Of course , darling . You could n't be righter . But a place like that simply screams for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of you and me . " " Well , why should n't there be grandchildren ? There 's a whole national forest right outside the kitchen door for them to get lost in and an enormous hay barn where they can break every bone in their bodies and a brook to fall into  --  what more do they want ? "  | " Oh , I 'm sure they 'll like it , " she said . " It 's just that everyone is so quiet about it . " " You 're overtired . You always get apprehensive when you 're overtired , " he said . " Let 's get the whole gang in and tell them about the place . They 'll go for it like hot cakes . " A WEEK LATER MRS . CROMBIEsucceeded in bringing all six members of the Crombie family together at dinner  --  a feat only made possible by the dismayed conviction on the part of all three families that the old folk had finally gone off the deep end . They assembled one Wednesday night like the scattered chieftains of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to a catastrophe . Pat and Bud were the first to arrive . Pat was the oldest and Mr. Crombie 's favorite , although he mistakenly supposed he had no favorites . Strikingly beautiful , blonde , of the type referred to among the horse crowd as " clean-limbed , " she showed no trace of her thirty-nine years or of bringing up three children in the midst of an inflation while at the same time taking a violently active part in the superthyroid life of Redding Ridge . She had married Bud Lansing during the war , an equally extroverted lad compounded of dismaying energy and brash self-confidence , two qualities highly respected and rewardedp106in his Madison Avenue habitat . The Lansings called themselvesLiberal Democrats and were full of advanced ideas  --  most of which , it seemed to Mr. Crombie , had to do with the deployment of other people 's money . From the jungles of Westport came the Dexter Crombies . Dexter , thirty-six , was an electronic engineer who lived in a world completely incomprehensible to any but his associates . In his moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , Elizabeth , who was an editor of Motherhood Magazine and chairman of the Eastern chapter of the Planned Parenthood Association . Mr. Crombie enjoyed Dexter and Elizabeth although they always left him with a slight feeling of inferiority . Sam and Linda were late . The residents of Sneden 's Landingmade a cult of being late , refusing to be shackled by the bonds of time . Sam and Linda represented the arts in the Crombie clan . Sam was an architect and his wispy , mouselike wife painted on porcelain and bore children . As he made the drinks , Mr. Crombie let the measuring jiggerslop over a bit into each glass . In spite of his bold words to Jinny , he sensed that this might not be a soft sale . And in spite of his declared conviction that what he and Jinny did was nobody 's business but their own , he knew in his heart that this was not so . He had decided to play the announcement down and bring it in casually after dinner . As a result the meal went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argumentsbetween the Lansings and the Dexter Crombies . EventuallyVerma , the colored maid , brought in the after-dinner coffee . Mr. Crombie took advantage of a momentary lull . " We bought the place in Highfield , " he said , casually . " It 's called Sunset Hill . " It seemed to him a direct , simple way of approaching the subject and had the advantage of finality . It was what they had been waiting for . He saw Pat glancep107quickly at her husband . " You mean the one with the brook running across the front lawn that you told me about , Mother ? " Mrs. Crombie nodded . " It 's so dreamy , " she said . " I ca n't wait for you all to see it . " " How much ? " It was Dexter who asked the crucial question , and typical of him , Mr. Crombie thought . Only an engineer would have approached it with such slide-rule bluntness . " Well , I do n't think that 's anything I 'd want to discuss , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was quite a bargain  --  quite a bargain . " They looked relieved . " How far is it by car ? " asked Sam . " Well , it 's a little over 150 miles from here , " said Mr. Crombie , " but it 's an easy drive . " " The grandchildren will just love it , " said Mrs. Crombie , a shade too enthusiastically . " There are miles and miles of real forest right behind the house and a huge barn and we 're going to put in a swimming pool . " Mr. Crombie looked surprised . " We 'll expect you every weekend . Some of you , anyway , " she finished lamely . " Listen , Mother , how do you think we 're going to get the children up there over a weekend ? Suppose we came up Friday night . Bud does n't get out to Redding Ridge till about six o'clock . Before he 's fed and we can get off , it would be seven . We 'd get there around midnight and have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there any train ? " asked Elizabeth . " Jamie gets carsick if he goes more than five miles . " " Yes , you can go to Middleburg . That 's where the college is . We could meet you there . It 's only fifteen miles away . " " The round trip would cost more than ten bucks , no matter how you go , " said Pat . " How can anybody afford that ? "  | " Why should you talk ? You 're loaded . Try being an architectwith four under five and you 'll take off your shoes when you come in the house just to save them . " Mr. Crombie looked crushed . This was an angle neither of them had considered . " I 'll pay for your gas or your train fare , " he said . " Oh , we 'll come , Dad . Just do n't expect us to do it often . " " If you really want to see us , " said Dexter , " just invite us to spend the night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's no treat to us . It 's a night in the city we look forward to . " Besides which we all work like pack mules every weekend on our own places , " said Bud . " Every time we go away we find ourselves working on somebody else 's place . That 's all right for the somebody else but it does n't do us any good . " Mr. Crombie had grown visibly smaller during this conversation . Now he drew himself up in his chair and his jaw protruded slightly . " Well , I hope you can come once in a while , " he said . " Mother and I have decided we want to live in the country . We 're going to put this apartment on the market . " " You 're going to what ? " There was unbelief in Pat 's voice . " Of course . We ca n't have two big places . We 're just going to have a hole in the wall in New York to use when we come in for the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we going to stay when we come in ? " asked Sam . " As you know , I 'm always here once or twice a week . " " And Bud and I always plan on one night a week during the winter . " " Where am I going when I work late in town ? " " I do n't know , " said Mr. Crombie unhappily . " I just do n't know . Maybe you can use the hole in the wall when we 're not there . " They dropped the subject . They were polite , much too polite . There was a trace of hostility in the air . At half-pastp109nine Sam rose . " I have to be up at the crack of dawn , " he said . " I think we 'll be pushing along . " The others leaped to their feet . Mr. Crombie stood with them in the vestibule waiting for the elevator . Pat kissed him good-by . " Thanks for the dinner , Pops . And I 'm glad you 've found a place you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get all the fun out of it you can . " The elevator door closed on them and he and Mrs. Crombie were alone , very much alone . They prepared for bed silently . Neither wanted to be the first to bring the evening up . Mr. Crombie tried to read , gave it up and snapped off his bed light . " We seem to have made a mess of things , " he said , addressinghis remarks to the darkness . " Nonsense , " she said . " Wait till they see it . They 'll be fightingfor beds . They just wo n't accept anything new in spite of the fact that they like to think of themselves as tomorrow 's babies . We 've got a lovely place . Now you just go to sleep and dream about it . " Hours later she listened to him snoring contentedly into his pillow while she lay staring at the reflection of the street lights on the ceiling , wondering , wondering . MAY FOLLOWED APRIL AS IT ALwayshas , only this time it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Miss Parkinson , " are you going to start clean/ing out your files and your desk drawers ? You certainly do n't want to lug all this junk home with you and you ca n't expect me to know what you want to throw away and what you want to keep . " " I assume by junk ' you mean my personal correspondence and private papers , " said Mr. Crombie coldly . Miss Parkinson nodded . " I promise you I 'll get after it , or them , immediately . " " I thought you might do it this Saturday , " she said . " You 've been about to do it immediately ' for a month . " " Saturday , " he said , reaching for his pocket engagement book . " I think . . . " " You have no engagements . Mrs. Crombie called me yesterdayand I asked her . " " O.K. , O.K. , " he said , returning the book to his pocket . " You two seem to know more about my life than I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , sir , " she said firmly . " This is your show . Nobody can do it for you . I 'm going to visit friends in New Jersey . " Mr. Crombie felt decidedly sorry for himself as he unlocked the entrance door of Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner at ten o'clock the next Saturday morning . The great empty office reminded him unhappily of some dear , dead friend . The old familiar features were there but , without the life that ordinarilysparked them , they were rather gruesome . He walked quickly to his own office , closing the door after him to shut out the emptiness beyond . He was cross at Miss Parkinson as he thought of her kicking up her heels in some New Jersey suburb . He hoped it was a dump . The row of files , painted to match the walls , confronted him with their grim challenge . Pulling open a drawer , he regarded its closely packed contents with dismay . Surely no man could have created all this correspondence in the course of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asp111full as this one . He wondered whether he should give the . whole works to Harvard . Would some sucker ever edit them ? The Letters of Graham Crombie in five volumes . He might be a modern Pepys . Perhaps he had better warm up by cleaning out his desk . Seating himself in his worn leather desk chair he pulled out the top middle drawer . It contained neatly sorted supplies of rubber bands , paper clips of various sizes , white scratch pads , a box of loose sheets headed " From the Office of Graham Crombie "  --  surely Miss Parkinson did n't expect him to go through the paper clips and discard the ones that were sprung . Near the front of the drawer was a sheaf of miscellaneous calling cards . They represented the gleanings of a decade . He removed the limp rubber band that bound them together and regarded the top one curiously . " E. Townsend Wombeck , Universal Mortgage Company . " Who in hell was E. TownsendWombeck ? He 'd never even heard of the Universal Mortgage Company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that was a beginning , anyway . The next one was from " William Cullen Lowenstein , U.S. Management Corp . " Was it possible that he was cleaning out the wrong desk ? " The Rev. Ovid Sims , Denver , Colorado . " " Marcus T. Bamburger , National Furniture Manufacturers ' Association , Grand Rapids . " He riffled through the remainder rapidly , seeking for at least one name that he could even dimly recall . Then , replacing the rubber band carefully , he tossed the lot into the basket . In the rear of the drawer was a box of his own business cards . He opened it and took one out . " Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner , Investment Counselors . Graham Crombie , President . " He started to put the box back in the drawer ; then it occurred to him that in another four weeks these cards would be merely souvenirs , like his college diploma or his honorable-discharge certificate from the Army . He had more than enough in his wallet to last for a month.  |p112Im|pulsively  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " Graham Crombie , President . " Feeling like one who has committeda painless form of hara-kiri , he turned to the right-hand top drawer . He and Miss Parkinson had always referred to this drawer as the Drug Department . Over the years any man is bound to have a few minor attacks of this or that . The remedy , usually purchased on his way back from lunch , eventually found its way into the Drug Department , there to remain forever after , for neither Miss Parkinson nor Mr. Crombie believed in throwing anything away that might conceivably be useful at some future time . Now , mixed in with the sodium bicarbonate , Gelusel tablets , Turns , Alka Seltzer , milk of magnesia tablets and whatnot were mysterious bottles of pills bearing Dr. Bailey 's name . He had no idea what they were for and there were seldom more than two or three pills missing from each bottle . Mr. Crombie could never remember to take pills . Just having them in his desk was apparently sufficient to cure whatever ailment was uppermost at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became part of the permanent collection . Mixed among them were rolls of chlorophyll tablets . Almost inevitably when you were forced to drink cocktails before lunch in the name of business hospitality , the Company 's most important and strait-laced customer was sure to drop in right after lunch and they always had noses like bird dogs . In the farthest corner was an old safety razor , a tube of shaving cream and a package of blades . He took out the razor and examined it curiously . He had had it in college and carried it in his musette bag all through World War I. This was something to be kept by all means . The rest he scooped up and tossed into the basket . Speculating on the cost of the unused drugs which he had thrown away in the course of a long life and how Thoreaup113would have reacted to such a situation , he turned to the drawer below . This Miss Parkinson referred to as the Odds and Ends Department . Its contents largely consisted of gift paperweights and letter openers bearing the names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that none of them would ever , under any circumstances , appear on the top of the desk , but as Miss Parkinson said , they were obviously too expensive to throw away in cold blood . Both felt instinctively that by putting them into storage for a suitablelength of time the amenities would be satisfied and then someday one could dispose of them without conscience interfering . The trouble was that anything that went into the Odds and Ends Department never came out . Well , the amenities had been satisfied and they were going to come out now . Pulling the wastebasket from under the desk , he dropped the contents of the drawer into it one by one . It gave him a feeling of freedom . The last one , a heavy bronze disc , he held in his hand for several minutes , thinking what a splendid noise it would make if he sailed it through the window beside him . Then sanity took over and he flung it into the basket with a satisfying crash . In the back of the drawer he discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out the photograph and snapped on his desk light to examine it more closely . It was the picture of one of his old girls , his first love as far as he could remember . Someone had sent it to him long after he married Jinny . He had n't seen it , or her , for years . Her head was thrown back and she was laughing , just the way she used to laugh when she was a kid in Cleveland . Gosh , she had been attractive ! He 'd never had a chance against that curly-headed lump of muscles she 'd finally married . Well , he hoped she was happy with him . Odd he 'd never taken this picture home . He was aboutp114to tear it up , but changed his mind . Taking an envelope from another drawer , he placed the photograph in it , sealed it and printed " Personal " across its face . Then he placed the envelope in the now almost empty Odds and Ends drawer . What he thought was going to become of it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other drawers were filled with office supplies , check books and canceled checks . Miss Parkinson could certainly take care of all that . He wheeled his chair around and faced the files once more . How could anyone possibly go through this endless accumulation of typed pages ? He pulled out a folder at random . The first letter in it was a carbon copy : " Dear Joe , Sorry you ca n't make lunch on Thursday . I wanted you to meet Mike Huntley before you go back . Better luck next trip . " It had been written eight years before . He could only remember Mike Huntley dimly and had entirely forgotten why he wanted Joe Ball to meet him . Well , that was one item that could be destroyed . He tore it up carefully . His eye fell on a series of folders marked " Projects 1954 , " " Projects 1955 , " " Projects 1956 , " etc . There was one for each year for at least two decades . He pulled out " Projects 1945 " and started to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copies of memos to various members of the staff , suggesting , decreeing , urging , wheedling . They were models of tact . " As you suggested at the officers ' meeting yesterday . . . " Always let the other fellow think the idea is his . These ideas were tops . What in the world had become of them ? Why had n't they been put into effect ? Or had they been and had they subsequently been quietly sabotaged ? He thought of all the effort that had gone into evolving them ; the preliminary research , the conferences , the painful drafting and redrafting , until every word carried the meaning intended for it , the announcement to the staff , after which thep115majority of them were allowed to wither on the vine until all that was left was a carbon copy in a project file . He thought of this process being duplicated in thousands of corporations throughout the country . They talked about the loss of man hours due to strikes . They should find a way of measuring the lost man hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special lock . This containedthe top-secret stuff  --  the files marked " Private and Confidential . " He unlocked it with a duplicate key which he kept among the abandoned ball-point pens in the top middle drawer of his desk and selected a file marked " Dunky Matter . " It had to do with the disappearance of ten thousand dollars ' worth of government bonds . The FBI had been in on the case and they strongly suspected a mouse of a man named Dunky in the Auditing Department . The bonds had turned up four or five years later wedged between a wall and a radiator in the Accounting Department . Unfortunately , poor Dunky had passed on to a less suspicious world in the meantime . Perhaps he never knew ; Mr. Crombie hoped not . He glanced at his wrist watch . It was almost one o'clock . How could he have spent three hours poking among these dusty fragments of an almost forgotten past , like an old crone hovering over a trash barrel ? The question was whether to go to the Club and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . He would probably work more efficiently with a little food . The big cocktail table in the main room of the Club was surrounded . That was the way it went . Some Saturdays there would n't be anyone in the place and the following week all the old-timers would assemble as if at the call of a soundless trumpet . He sat down next to Joe Backer , who was in the midst of a long dialect story , and rang the bell for the bar waiter . It was almost three o'clock when he returned to the office ,  |p116feeling  drowsy . It annoyed him to find the Confidential File drawer still open just as he had left it . Who did he think was coming in to close it ? At the rear of the drawer was an open space behind the manila folders . He put his hand in and pulled out a pair of rubbers that had been missing for several years . It was hopeless . There was only one thing to do . Jettison the whole thing  --  lock , stock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up . His wastebasketfilled quickly . He brought in one from Miss Parkinson'sdesk . Would she get a surprise when she came in Monday morning and found the filing cabinets empty ! His wrists grew tired . Tearing up files reminded him of a strongman who once came to a summer hotel where he went when he was a little boy and tore up telephone books . Miss Parkinson 's basket overflowed . He let the pieces fall to the floor in an ever-growing mound . What was he accomplishing by all this conscientious demolition ? What cleaning woman would ever want to read this stuff ? He drew out half a dozen files and threw them on top of the heap untorn . Now he was getting somewhere . With a mounting frenzy he emptied drawer after drawer . This was the way firemen must feel . He was standing knee deep in manila folders . Closingthe last empty drawer with a bang , he pulled his chair back to his desk . Picking a sheet of paper from the floor , he found a red pencil and printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the pile . It was too small . She would never see it . He would get one of the big graph sheets from Statistical and use the reverse side . He stopped in the chartroom just off Statistical . This was Joe Hennessy 's baby . The charts were mounted on hinged panels which you could flip over and examine like wallpaper samples . Joe had charted every possible situation he couldp117think of ; the price of barley since the American Revolution , the relationship between the cost of labor and corporate profits , the fluctuations of the cocoa market . It was the living world reduced to saw-toothed lines ; weak lines attempting to keep up with strong ascending lines , then giving up in despair and sinking limply to the lower right-hand corner ; competitivelines , battling savagely with one another across the charts ; turbulent lines , suggesting a cross section of the Grand Tetons . These things must cost a fortune to maintain and no one really looked at them except prospective customers  --  who were forced to . The man hours lost keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preparation of abandonedprojects . Picking up a piece of graph paper from one of the desks , he returned to his office and prepared a new notice for the cleaningwoman . As he surveyed the wreckage he was glad that it would all be picked up by Monday morning before Miss Parkinson came in . She would disapprove of such a careless disposal of important papers and insist on everything being reduced to confetti . He felt emotionally disturbed , as if he had thrown away a part of himself  --  unread . Perhaps it would be a good idea to walk home and settle back to normalcy before seeing Jinny . He found himself passing the Club and decided to drop in just to check up on who was around . He felt the need to reestablishcontact with the familiar . There was no use seeking companionship upstairs . The Saturday-afternoon bridge playerswere hard at work there and brooked no interruptions . He wandered to the bar , which was empty except for Freddie Wimple , who was seated at a table gazing moodily at the bartender who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p118Thanks  to the diligence of his ancestors , Freddie Wimple had never done a day 's work in his life . Mr. Crombie had always considered him as more or less of a joke . Now his urge to talk to somebody , anybody , caused him to greet Freddie almost effusively . " Have a drink ? " he asked . Freddie made a noise intended to indicate that he consideredthis a sound idea . They ordered two Scotch and sodas and sipped them silently for several minutes . " Where you going this summer ? " asked Freddie . He usuallystarted all conversations with checkup questions of this nature . " I 'm retiring , " said Mr. Crombie . " We 've just bought a house in the country and we 're going to be busy getting settled . " " Retiring ? " asked Freddie , puzzled . " You mean from busi-ness ? " " Of course . Did you think I meant I was going to bed ? " " Congratulations , " said Freddie , his voice animated for the first time .

People sittin ' in conferencestalkin ' about things they do n't understand . Writin ' memos to each other nobody pays any attention to . Mr. Crombie winced . Thinkin ' up new ways to be complicated just to impress somebody . Waste , waste , waste . All the business in the world could be done between ten in the morning and noon if people would cut out the waste . " " Oh , come now . You live on the earnings of business , do n't you ? " .

Freddie Wimple had been just the medicine he needed . In another month he would be free to kick his heels and start raisin ' hell . MR . CROMBIE POUND THAT WHENthey were alone in the evening he had a tendency to go to sleep right after dinner .

Sleepy as he was , he did n't want to go to bed , because he knew that after a few hours of drugged sleep he would be catapulted into consciousness once more , condemned to lie staring at the ceiling for the remainder of the night . Of course at such times the obvious thing to do was to make his mind a blank and go back to sleep , a task which reminded him of a man rushing around an old house trying to keep the wind from seeping through loose windows . After a while some particularly worrisome thought would move in and he would cease to struggle . It used to be the office . Now , more and more frequently , it was the new house in the country that took command . How in the world was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to clean houses for you in the country ? Would Jinny ever find a small apartment in town ? Or would he go bankrupt carrying their present apartment and the country place ? How did he know that , when Jinny found a new apartment , they would be able to sell the one they were in ? People did n't want a big barn of a place like this any more . The first thing he knew he 'd be stuck with three places . He suddenly realized that he 'd never gone into the water system in the new house . How did one go into a water system ? He 'd asked where the water came from and they had said an artesian well . What else should he have asked ? As a matter of fact , he 'd never gone into anything at all in connection with the new house . Did it leak ? Was it full of termites ? Was the furnace any good ? Was the place infested with rats ? Were there mosquitoes in summer ? These were all things a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All he had done was to hand the owner a check for what she asked . A place like that would take two men to keep up and he was tackling it all by himself . He must be crazy . He felt all right now , but in five years he 'd be seventy and men of seventyp121did n't go around chopping out underbrush and staggering around with armfuls of firewood . He turned over violently , hoping that Jinny would hear him and say something , but her breathing only became more peacefully regular . When they moved , part of the furniture would go to the country and part to the little apartment that Jinny had n't found yet . How in the world were they going to divide all this stuff ? And how were the movers going to know what went where ? The whole thing really was a mess . He wondered what Jinny would say if he announced to her at breakfast that he was putting Sunset Hill on the market . In the next bed she broke into a contented purr . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so relaxed , so far removed from Mr. Crombie 's tortured world , that it infuriatedhim . It was as if she had dumped all their common cares and problems into his lap and gone on a vacation . He turned on his bed light and arranged his pillows for reading , hoping that she would wake up . She did n't stir . He opened his book and read until his eyes , straying over the top of the book , noted the first ghostly light of dawn . It was more than he could take . Closing the book he snapped out the readinglight and wriggled under the covers until only the top of his head was showing . In a few minutes he was asleep . He was awakened by Jinny 's hand shaking his shoulder . " Gray , you 're going to be late again and get yourself into a lather the way you did yesterday . " He looked at her with sleep-heavy , appealing eyes . " Oh , no , " he said . " Do n't . I had just gotten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes ago . " " Nonsense , " she said , " you snored like a grampus all night . " There was no use arguing . A man knew if he had n't slept and it did no good to prove it to anyone . He swung his feet out of bed and after a moment or two padded unsteadily to the bathroom.  |p122THE  INEVITABLE DINNER TO THEretiring president was over  --  at least his part in it was over . He and Gleason and a few others had pulled out around midnight . The others were still sitting in the oak-paneled dining room at the Club . There they would remain , drinking faster and faster , talking louder and louder , until either their control towers closed for the night or the silent , patient waiters removed the portable bar from the corner of the room . Mr. Crombie entered the apartment quietly and placed a bulky flannel-swathed object on the table . The idea of going to bed was repugnant to him . He wanted a Scotch and soda . God knew he did n't need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only another highball could quell . There was a note from Jinny on the hall table . " Hope the dinner was all you deserve . Ice bucket and the necessary in the library . " That was so typical of Jinny . She knew just when to do the right thing even though it did n't fit into her woman 's ideas . If more wives would realize that men and women were quite different  --  as different as dogs and cats  --  Reno would still be a small town . He mixed himself a drink and let his body fall wearily into the big leather chair in the library . After a few moments he rose and picked up the flannel bag from the hall table . Untyingthe drawstring he pulled out a large silver bowl which he held up to the light so that he might read again the en/graved signatures which covered its gleaming sides . Every officer was there and , in addition , old " Jackal " Jones . That had been a touch  --  having Jackal at the dinner . He had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardiner was organized and had been his humble , loyal slave for thirty-five years , asking nothing , giving all . He turned the bowl so that the light from the table lamp lit up the inscription : To Graham Crombiewho had the courage to put hisdreams into action . This bowl is a symbol of the enduring esteem and affectionof those privileged to have had a small part in the building of a great enterprise . The words brought into focus something that had been bothering him all evening . Dinners like this marked a point in time  --  a dividing point  --  when there was no longer anything in common between the hosts and the honored guest . The former were , in effect , dropping the pilot . He , his role completed , could only look backward . They , although they made a brave pretense that this was also for them an evening of nostalgia , were only concerned with the future . The pilot had brought them through the narrow places . Now , for them , the open sea lay ahead . He would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces into semidarkness ; the long table littered with bottles , glasses , silver ice bowls and crumplednapkins ; the deep shadows on the faces of the diners ; everyone clapping and cheering as Gleason finished his speech of presentation and handed Mr. Crombie the bowl ; Tommy Potter , who had wanted the top job so badly , rising , very drunk , to make an impromptu speech and being pulled down with laughter and much horseplay by Bingham and Joep124Loomis ; the young account executives whose early , respectful reserve had been swept away by a reckless absorption of martinisand the Club 's choicest wines , egging Tom Potter on , trying to show him by their enthusiasm that he was still their man and that they regarded Gleason as a stuffed shirt . Mr. Crombie was on his feet , then , waiting for the din to subside ; ready with his swan song . The first and last part of his speech had been a tremendous success . He was a natural storyteller and he had opened with two or three of his best efforts just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more receptive audience . It was too bad after such a good start that he had dwelt so long on the early history of the Company . Reminiscences , which meant so much to him , were tales from the Dark Ages to most of these boys . Their risibles had been aroused by his stories and they had sat alert , at first , ready for fresh opportunitiesfor laughter . Their responses gradually became formallypolite until finally their faces froze into those masks of attention behind which men hide when they cease to listen and abandon themselves to their own thoughts or to their lack of them . He was too old a hand to have fallen under the spell of his own words , but that is just what he had done . He had always made a point of watching the faces of his audience for signs of inattention , but tonight his eyes were turned back on other scenes . It was not until young Applegate ( Miss Parkinson 's " cute Mr. Applegate " ) fell off his chair that he came to his senses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and calling the dinner sharply to order . He was quite able to control his own crew . He had wound up the speech quickly and sat down . They gave him an ovation that constricted his throat so that he could not speak . There had been a dreadful moment when he thought he was going to cry . He chose to think that a goodp125part of the enthusiasm was because they realized there would be no more speeches , but he knew in his heart that they liked him . You did n't want to take these overtures too seriously , however . Of course a certain percentage of it was personal . The rest was for that idol of clay , the great god Boss . The build-up of an executive was a highly developed technique . One moment you were the promising young man , permitted to sit , on occasion , in the councils of the elders , but unheeded and unnoticed ; then , suddenly , a few men came out of an inner room smiling knowingly and sent for you . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of the whole world changed . Customers who had never spoken to you before stopped at your desk to ask your opinion on things you knew nothing about . Committees waited on you deferentially to ask you to join other committees . Corporation presidents asked you to lunch at the Downtown Association and the Brook Club in order to sound you out as to whether you would undertake some backbreaking philanthropic job . Old jokes that you had trotted out previously and in vain at many a tongue-tied business lunch were suddenly received with overhearty laughter . Ideas that you had tried to sell for years were now adopted with acclaim . At Christmastime your home and your office were flooded with greetings from wellwishers . Tycoons from whom you had never been able to drag two words suddenly became shoulder-patting buddies . It was heady stuff . It ruined some . Few came through the ordeal without being changed to some degree . The very care with which you must now weigh your words was bound to have some effect on one 's character . Whereas yesterday people paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to get your point across , now the very opposite was true . Small wonder that over the years the top-brass men grew taciturn.  |p126Taciturnity  was n't as bad as pompousness , though , but few wholly escaped the latter either . Few went through the ordeal of success without acquiring some trace of what Miss Parkinsonreferred to as " boo boo boo . " Gleason had more than a trace of " boo boo boo " and oddly enough one of the troubles with Tom Potter was that he had none at all and never would have . Perhaps just a dash of it was necessary in a top executive , just as a dash of overassurance was necessary in an actor . Perhaps the gap between executives and actors was not so great as people supposed . He wondered how pompous he appeared to his staff and to the world . Heaven knew he did n't feel pompous . He might well have become so , however , had he not been flanked by Jinny and Miss Parkinson . It would be hard to imagine two more alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a year to go before she also was retired . The most lonely person in any organization is the late Boss 's secretary . Gleason had taken her on , but quite obviously she never would be happy with him . With her old boss gone she only waited for retirement so that she could travel and read . At least that was what she had told him . It was hard to think of Miss Parkinson traveling or reading or doing anything , in fact , but sitting in the outer office taking care of him . And how faithfully she had done that . How could he have survived those early years without her ? How he had survived them even with her was something of a miracle . What strange conceit , born of ignorance , had led him to believe that he was qualified to start an investment-counsel firm and lead it to success ? He was not an investment expert . He was not even investment minded , if he wanted to be thoroughly honest with himself . How had he been able to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about securities than he ever knew ? How had hep127brought in those first accounts which had enabled them to survive until a rising stock market paved the way to the top ranks ? Perhaps it was because he was genuinely fond of most people . He is sure of one thing  --  if you sincerely liked a man you could be reasonably sure that he liked you . And the reverse was equally true . If you did n't like him , the odds were that he thoroughly reciprocated your feelings . And even if he was one of your best customers no amount of backslapping and mutual protestations of good fellowship could change that fact and it was well to take it into your calculations . He had also discovered early in life that men do not grow up in quite the same way that women do . In spite of their seeming maturity most of them remain little boys at heart . That was why they responded so readily to conventions and outings , fishing trips and poker clubs , reunions , old school ties and outdoor cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business life . It was one of the factors which enabled him to mingle with men easily and informally after a relatively short acquaintance , while others were never able to get past the stage of stiff formality . He was surprised to find that his highball glass was still half full . He looked at his wrist watch . It was two-thirty . He heard Jinny calling , " Gray , what 's the matter with you ? Have you gone to sleep in there ? " " No , dear . Just thinking things over . I 'll be in in a minute . " He heard her get out of bed and come down the hall . " Do you know you 've been sitting here almost two hours ? How did it come off ? " " They dropped the pilot , " he said . She looked at him , anxiously . " Come on now , darling . Get some sleep in bed before it 's time to get up . "  |p128EVEN  IF THE SAND ON JONESBeach were to be removed a grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one grain would remain . No matter how endless the days seem as we look ahead and count them by years , then months , then weeks , the last day will eventually creep up behind us and pounce with the unexpectednessof a panther springing from the branches of a tree . " Well , boss , this is it . Gateway to freedom day , " said Miss Parkinson . " I 've given all your office mail to Mr. Gleason . There 's some personal stuff here that you 'll probably want to answer . " While I have a secretary , " he added , with the thin smile of a martyr who watches the faggots lighted about his feet but is determined to be a good sport about it . She looked as if she were going to say something , then she compressed her lips into a thin straight line , sat down in the chair beside his desk and opened her notebook as she had done so many hundreds of times before . The letters she had saved for him were mostly from business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lightly , confidently . They were good letters . He could confirm that by watching Miss Parkinson 's sensitive face . He always knew when he was on the beat by the appreciative little smile that played around the corners of her mouth.  |p129The  phone rang . It was the first time it had rung that morning . Miss Parkinson picked up the receiver . " Mr. Garbotchto see you , " she said , placing her hand automatically over the receiver . " He just wants to say good-by . " Mr. Crombie made a face . " Typical of him , " said Miss Parkinson , scornfully . " Do you want me to get rid of him ? " " No , he 's a perfectly good customer . Tell him to come in . " Miss Parkinson went out and a moment later Mr. Garbotch entered , loud and overhearty . " Crombie , I ca n't believe it . This is n't going to be the same place without you . I 'm not going to say good-by , though . We 've been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Just dropped in to wish you all kinds of luck . " Mr. Garbotch settled his immense body into the chair beside the desk . " No , sir . We 've known each other too long to lose contact now . I 'm going to keep in touch with you , Crombie . I value your views on market conditions more than those of anyone I know . That 's not saying much , though , because any guy that can forecast the market today is Superman , I 'm telling you . " He looked belligerently around the room at the colored prints as if waiting for Mr. Crombie to contradict this statement . " You know what I think ? I think we 're just starting the biggest boom in history . Let me have that pad a minute . I want to show you some figures . " For the next half hour Mr. Garbotch contentedly filled page after page with figures , all demonstrating the fact that in six months the Dow Jones average would be a hundred points higher . Miss Parkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , yes , " exclaimed Mr. Crombie , raising his voice in order to penetrate Mr. Garbotch 's statistic-laden consciousness , " Ralph Barton . You know Ralph Barton , Morris . Tell him to come in , Miss Parkinson . "  | " I 've got to go , " said Mr. Garbotch . " I 'm late now . The point I want to make is this . . . " He was off again , tearing sheets from Mr. Crombie 's pad and dropping them on the floor . Mr. Barton appeared in the doorway. " , . . department-store sales in the ten key cities , " said Mr. Garbotch . " Hello , Graham , " said Mr. Barton . " I just ca n't believe it . I did n't come in to say good-by . You 're going to be around and I 'm going to keep in touch .... " Mr. Garbotch , obviously annoyed by the interruption , tossed his last sheet of unfinished forecasts on the floor . " I got ta be going , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Crombie tried to accompany him to the door , but Garbotch had disappeared before he could round his desk . " I hope I did n't interrupt . . . " said Mr. Barton apologetically . " Miss Parkinson said to come right in . " " That 's right , " said Mr. Crombie , picking up Mr. Garbotch'slitter . " You did n't interrupt a bit . Old Morris was just giving me a preview of tomorrow 's financial page . How are you , anyway ? " " Well , I 'm not so good , " said Mr. Barton . " But I did n't come to talk about myself . I ca n't stay a minute . Just dropped in to congratulate you on your retirement , or commiserate you , or whatever you do when a guy 's leaving the old treadmill . " ' Well , I appreciate it , " said Mr. Crombie . " Sorry to hear things are n't right with you , though . What 's the trouble ? " " Oh , it 's a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulationis n't right . Ankles swell up . Doctors ca n't find out what the matter is . " Mr. Crombie , not knowing what to say , clicked his tongue sympathetically . Mr. Barton nodded . " Then Mrs. Barton 's not very well .... " " I 'm sorry to hear that . " " Yes , she has dizzy spells , " said Mr. Barton . " Ca n't tellp131when they 're going to hit her . One minute she 'll be talking to you about this and that , bright as a button . The next minute she 's on the floor . The doctors ca n't figure it out . " Mr. Crombie shook his head . " You get these things when you get older , " said Mr. Barton , almost cheerfully . " I watched my father and mother go and I want to tell you , Graham , I 'll never forget it . " He launched into a harrowing account of the last ten gruesome years of his parents ' lives . Miss Parkinson appeared , eventually , and placed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Miss Pankhurstis on the phone . " There was no " Miss Pankhurst . " She was a figment of Miss Parkinson 's imagination , to be used for rescue work . Mr. Crombie was now free to say , " Will you see if you can get her to talk to Mr. Gleason ? I do n't want to be interrupted right now , " or " I 'm afraid I 'll have to take this . It 's important . Tell her I 'll be with her in a moment . " He chose the latter alternative , to Mr. Barton 's obvious annoyance . " I 'm sorry I did n't have time to finish , " he said , rising unwillingly . " It 's an interesting story . Well , I must run . You 've made me late for an appointment as it is . All I wanted to do was to congratulate you on your retirement , or maybe I should commiserate you . Be seeing you . " " Mr. Gleason wants to come in when you are free , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " No , please . He said for me not to tell you , but to let him know when you were free , else you 'd be coming to him . " She returned to her desk and in a few minutes Gleason appeared in the doorway . " I really feel like a traitor to do this , Graham , but you made me promise to tell you if the staff was planning any little whimsies , so I suppose I have to . I got it through the grapevine that they 're going to waylay you on your way out this after/noon and give you three rousing huzzahs , or call for a speech or something . " Mr. Crombie 's face was contorted with anguish . " Oh , no , " he said , " they ca n't . I could n't take it . Please . " " Nonsense , " said Mr. Gleason . " They want to and they should . This company 's losing something , Graham , and you 're the only one that does n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm sorry , Joe , I have a date . " " Well , there was nothing on my mind . Just thought we could break bread for once without talking business . Oh , well  --  there 'll be plenty of other chances . I 've got to get back now . Mr. Marston is coming in . " Nothing that Gleason could have said would have depressed Mr. Crombie more than the announcement that Marston was coming in to see him . For a quarter of a century Kendrick Marston had never discussed his ramified and complex affairs with anyone but Mr. Crombie . He rose from his desk and walked to the window . Fifteen stories below him the ceaseless traffic of Park Avenue moved north and south , halting with the long line of red lights , then resuming its antlike progress as the line turned green . " They do n't even wait for the king to die , " he muttered . He walked to the outer office and took his hat from the rack . " I 'm going to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's only twelve o'clock , " she said . " I know . I 'm going early . Have an errand on the way . " " Where are you going to be ? You have no luncheon date today ? " " I 'm going home , if you have to know . For keeps . I ca n't take it . " Then , seized by a sudden impulse , " I do n't suppose you 'd have lunch with me , would you ? Last rites and all that sort of thing ? "  |p133She  shook her head without looking at him . " Thanks a lot , " she said . " We would n't know what to say to each other after all these years . " He reached out and touched the back of her thin hand with his finger tips . " I 'll be seeing you , " he said . She could only nod as she watched his heavy frame pass through the door . Then she jumped up from her desk , went into his office and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was silent.  |p137MRS  . CROMBIE SANK LIMPLY INTOan armchair . The floor of the big , low-ceilinged living room of Sunset Hill was filled from wall to wall with cartons , furniture , lamps without shades , shades without lamps and lumpy packages . " Well , " she said , " we 're in . " " We sure are , " said Mr. Crombie . " Up to our necks . " " Do you know something , " she said , " there 's a crack in that ceiling . " But he was not listening . He had opened one of the cartons . Seated on the floor he was examining its contents . " I have n't seen a lot of this stuff for years , " he said . " This is my old war diary and here 's the map I carried the day we went over the top at Bois des Forges . Gosh , I 'd forgotten all about this . Listen . This was written right after the attack on the 26th of September . Last night they moved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel to wheel . At .. " " For heaven 's sake , Graham , have n't you got enough trouble without starting to fight World War I all over again ? Before you begin emptying cartons and digging up your past , let 's get some of this truck out of the way so we can walk aroundp138the room instead of climbing around it . Now those cartons over there are all books . Why do n't you take them into your library ? That will give us room to turn around at least . " " Why do n't we mix a couple of martinis instead ? " he suggested . " I 've been working since eight o'clock this morning . I 'm pooped . " " But it 's only four o'clock . We have two hours work ahead of us . If we do n't keep at it we 'll never get straightened out . " Mr. Crombie groaned and picked up a carton of books . " Why do people insist on carting around a mountain of books they 're never going to read again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staggering to the door . " Do n't talk to me . They 're your books . You would n't part with one of them for money . " " In my present state of mind I 'd part with everything I own for money  --  including my wife . " " That crack in the ceiling bothers me , " she said . " I wonder why we did n't notice it before ? " IT HAD BEEN A TEMPESTUOUSthree weeks . Mr. Crombie felt tired and worn . The old apartment on the river had been sold . The greater part of its contents , accumulated during thirty years of living in one place , had found its way to Sunset Hill , the balance had gone into storage until the little apartment in New York , which they had also bought , was ready for occupancy.  |p139Never  in all his years of active business life had he toiled so hard , so continuously and with such a sense of frustration . He was used to working in accordance with an orderly pattern , but there was no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , begins to be pulled apart , the operation quickly assumesan explosive quality . There were moments when he felt like a disaster victim standing amid the wreckage of his old familiar world , not knowing what to lay hold of first or where to turn . Through it all , the routine demands of living kept piling up relentlessly . Each morning , while they were still in the old apartment , the incoming mail would be left by the elevator man on the little marble-topped table in the foyer . Each day the ringing phone would bring its quota of small problems  --  problems which , despite their unimportance , must be met . Would he leave a two weeks ' visitors ' card at the Club for Joe Marcus from Milwaukee ? Would he be willing to serve on a little special committee  --  no work , just a couple of meetings ? A young Englishman was coming to New York  --  a charming fellow ( all Englishmen always were ) . Would it be convenient  --  would they  --  could they ? Ordinarily he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and dumping it on Miss Parkinson 's desk the next morning . But there was no longer any Miss Parkinsonto take down his replies , to make telephone calls for him , to arrange his life and smooth his way . His comfortable old ruts had disappeared overnight and he stood in the middle of a vast plain devoid of direction signs . He had thought of retirement as something serene , tranquil , orderly , and during his last few months at the office he had frequently looked forward to his first day as a free man : the day when he could turn over and go to sleep again if he so desired , when he could do as he chose , dress as he chose , take a drink if he wanted to , not take one if he did n't want to ,  |p140go  to sleep when he felt tired , be himself , in short , for the first time in decades . It had turned out so differently . Instead of sleeping luxuriouslyfar into the morning he had begun the day by waking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no question of going back to sleep . He had slipped out of bed and worked at his desk in the already half-dismantled library until breakfast was ready . There was something about the feel of a desk under his elbows that soothed him . At breakfast he had placed the New York Times beside his plate with a feeling of anticipation . He had always been too hurried to read the Times thoroughly . Now he proposed to go through it at his leisure from front to back . Mrs. Crombie glanced apprehensively at the pantry door . " Verma 's served notice , " she said . " She wo n't go to the country . " He looked up , unbelieving . " Verma ? " he said . " Why she ca n't do that  --  she 's been with us for twenty years . " " Well , she can and , what 's more , she has . All this talk she 's been hearing about retirement has proved contagious . She 's going to retire herself  --  going out to live with her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Well , you know , dear , I 've been thinking about it and I 've come to the conclusion that maybe it 's a good thing . In the first place , it saves us money and you say we have to economize . Mr. Crombie nodded eagerly . " And in the second place , we 'll be coming to New York once a week and you ca n't keep dragging Verma back and forth like a French poodle . Besides , there 's no maid 's room in the little apartment and she certainly would n't want to stay out in that lonely place all by herself . " " It is n't a lonely place , " he said . " It would be for Verma. "  | " But who 's going to do the cooking ? " " I am , I suppose . I ca n't say I look forward to it . " " I ca n't say that I do , either . You have n't tried to cook since we were first married , but I can still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but maybe I wo n't when I get used to it . At any rate , that 's the score and we might as well face it . " " I suppose so , " he said , " but this is a fine time of life to start facing things . Oh , well  --  we 'll get along somehow . Most of our friends seem to . " He tried to make his voice sound cheerful as he resumed his attack on the Times , but he felt uneasy and disturbed , conscious that already something comfortable was moving out of his life  --  something he had always taken for granted . Was n't it John Marquand who had said that we never appreciated anything until we lost it ? He finished the Times and discovered that it was almost ten o'clock . That was far too long a time to spend absorbing news , most of which he forgot before he turned the page . On the other hand , now that he was retired time did n't matter so much . Perhaps it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . Did he know that the morning was half gone and there were a thousand things to be done in connection with the country house and the new apartment and the impending sale of the one they were in ? All that day he had answered phones and run errands . Just before lunch Jinny had given him a long list of things demandingimmediate attention and disappeared . He never knew where . The apartment was unbearably still and lonely . Feeling put-upon and low in spirits , he went down to the Club for lunch . He ate at the long common table with a group of men he had never seen before and , after doing a few of Jinny 's errands , returned to the apartment exhausted . He felt sleepy . Well , he was free now . If he was sleepy why not sleep ? He threw himself on his bed . After dozing for fifteen minutes , he sprang up . God , was he going to startp142hitting the sack in the middle of the afternoon ? He wandered into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he never had any opportunity to read the magazines to which he had been subscribing for years . He started to read the first article , but either it was extremely dull or there was something the matter with his brain , for at the end of ten minutes he had no idea what the author was talking about and no great desire to find out . The cleaning woman appeared . He had n't known she was in the apartment and he was startled . She wanted to know when she could do the living room . He delivered it into her hands and went back to his desk in the library with the feeling that this was where he had come in . THEY SOLD THE OLD APARTMENTalmost immediately . The purchasers , an unlovable couple who went about peering into closets and exchanging sneers , wanted occupancy as soon as possible  --  or sooner . Jinny said it was better that way . A move as big and as complex as this should be done quickly , not dragged out . They would select what they needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weed it out after they moved in . In that way the whole thing would be very simple indeed . " We can save some money , " said Mr. Crombie , co-operatively , " by taking out as much as we can in the station wagon  --  all the loose stuff and that sort of thing . "  |p143The  day elevator man at the apartment began to dread calls from the tenth floor , knowing that when his door opened he would be faced by a hallful of dilapidated suitcases , loose clothes on hangers , open cartons from which things fell when you picked them up , floor lamps , framed pictures , most of them so old that the paper was hanging from their backs , books , radios , and a motley of small articles all of which , under the ground rules governing apartment houses , he must deliver to the doorman , armful by armful , while the other tenants of the building buzzed angrily for the elevator . People living in high-grade apartments simply did not go in for this slaphappy , gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper kind took themselves off to Antigua or Jamaica or the Arizona Biltmore while duly accredited membersof the movers union transferred their goods from the old home to the new with such efficiency that when the master and his lady returned , their clothes were hanging in the new closets in their accustomed order . Mr. Crombie became so uncomfortably aware of this that he tried to compensate for his behavior by tipping like a movie star . Fortunately he did n't have to repeat this costly process at the other end of the line . There he was on his own in the most literal sense . " I 'll help you , " Mrs. Crombie would assure him , seizing several hatboxes and a loose Thermos bottle as they drew up in front of the kitchen door at Sunset Hill . Then she would disappear permanently into the house while Mr. Crombie staggered back and forth with insecure armfuls until the station wagon was empty . " Where do you want me to put this stuff , " he would yell as he entered the kitchen door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , cheerily , from some remote part of the house . After waiting a few minutes he could no longer stand the pain in his arms and would pile everything on the floor and gop144back for another load . They would work until sunset and drive back to town in the evening , stopping for dinner at some roadside tavern along the way . Mr. Crombie was so used to eating in public places on an expense account that it pained him to see his pocket cash melt like butter on a stove . The day had been when the friendly greeting of a headwaiter was something to warm the heart . Now he began to regard all purveyors of food and drink as bandits , and as he looked about at the family groups stuffing themselves phlegmatically all around him , he could only conclude that everyone in New England was loaded except the Crombies , or else they did n't pay their income taxes . And then came " M " Day , when a group of beefeaters invadedthe apartment and in grim silence began transferring their belongings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observing similar piles of other people 's furniture standing at the curbside , waiting to be packed into vans . It had always interested him to note that , no matter how expensive the apartment house from which these lares and penates came , they always looked as if they belonged in a tenement and not a very good one at that . Now , when he went down to inspect progress at the van level , he was shocked to discover that their fine old mahogany pieces and their interior-decorator upholstered chairs , when exposed to the glare of the noonday sun , had the same dilapidated , beaten-up look . It depressed him so that he considered the advisability of giving everything to some thrift shop and starting all over again , thus saving the hideous cost of vanning.  |p145IT  WAS SUNDAY MORNING . THEYwere having breakfast in the sun-flecked dining room at SunsetHill . Through the open door leading to the terrace a warm breeze entered from the valley and ruffled the pages of Mr. Crombie 's paper . All about them the floor was strewn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid there because the person carrying them did n't know what else to do with them . " If we do n't get this mess cleaned up pretty soon , I 'm going crazy , " said Mrs. Crombie . " I know , " he said , " but the thing to do is not to get excited about it . There 's a lot to be done , but we have eternity to do it in . I 'm retired . We must get used to that . Plenty of time for everything . That 's the kind of philosophy we must cultivate . Then life will flow like a river . " " That 's nice , " she said . " But do n't forget we go to New York tomorrow afternoon for your directors ' meeting Tuesday morning and the river stops flowing for a couple of days . " There was a look of dismay on his face as he laid down the paper . " Oh , no , " he said , " we ca n't go off and leave things like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , of course not . " They were silent , she waiting , he thinking . " I 'll tell you what we might do . If we drive down to New York after lunch it somehow knocks the whole day out.  |p146I  do n't know why , but it does . Could n't we start at six o'clock and have dinner on the road ? Then we 'd have a full day here . It probably would be a good idea to do the same thing on the way back . I think it 's nicer to drive in the cool of the evening , anyway . " O.K. , " she said . " I 'll do anything to get this place straightenedout so we can begin to live in it , and of course we 've got the same problem with the place in town . What it amounts to is that , now you 're retired , life is so hectic we have to run a night shift twice a week . " " Once we get settled . . . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of toast ? " " Do you realize , " said Mrs. Crombie , dropping two slices of bread into the toaster , " that we must buy another toaster for the apartment ? " The dreadful implications of this statement slowly permeatedMr . Crombie 's consciousness . " And do you realize , " he said with dramatic slowness , " that that applies to almost everything we own ? " " Oh , sure , practically everything . " " I 'll have to have another safety razor and another hairbrush . We must duplicate all the kitchen things . We 'll need another ice bucket , another radio , another television , another set of dining-room furniture , china  --  we 'll have to order writingpaper for both places . Good God ! " " Of course , " said Mrs. Crombie . " What did you think we 'd do  --  tow a U-Haul-It after us everytime we went to town ? " " I did n't think , " he moaned . " Why do n't people ever think of the simple , obvious things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Ark . At least the animals were for free , but this  --  this is going to cost a fortune . " " Oh , well . Take it easy . We 'll just get the things we have to have and if we buy the rest gradually we wo n't even notice it.  | " I do n't know why it is , " said Mr. Crombie , " that you seem to feel that if we can spend money in such a way that we do n't notice it , it 's the same as not spending it at all . " But Mrs. Crombie was n't listening . As far as she was concernedthe crisis was over . She was casting an appraising eye at the congestion around them . " You know , " she said , " when you have an apartment as big as ours was you never have to throw anything away  --  you just push it behind something and there it stays forever and ever . Now that it 's finally been pulled out into the daylight , for heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again without getting rid of the things we really do n't want . " Mr. Crombie looked pained . " This thing is like an openendedpipe , " he said , " with the water running in one end and going out the other . Half our time has to be spent buying duplicates of practically everything we own and the other half throwing things away . Why is it that what was so preciousa few years ago suddenly becomes so objectionable that we wo n't even give it house room ? " " Because , dear , things get worn out . Our habits change . We have no further use for things . There are lots of reasons . Now you take that beaten-up raccoon coat that you used to have in college . The fur is all worn off the back . You 're never going to wear it again , but there the old moth sanctuary hangs , taking up room . Now that 's just one item . . . . " " You bet it is , " interrupted Mr. Crombie . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . That 's the coat I wore all through Harvard . I sometimes think women are devoid of sentiment . Why , I would n't let that coat go for anything . Anyway , I 'll get a lot of use out of it in the country . " " Doing what ? Sleigh-riding ? " " No , not sleigh-riding , " he said . " Listen . I do n't go around throwing your clothes away . Why do n't you leave mine alone . " " O.K. , O.K. , " she said . " I did n't know you were going top148get all worked up about it . I 'm simply trying to tell you that I do n't want to store away a vanload of things we know we 're never going to use again . Now here 's what I suggest . You sort out the rest of your books and papers and get them stowed away in your library . While you 're doing that I 'll go over the rest of this stuff . Whatever I think we should get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll swear not to throw anything away until you see it . " " All right , " he said , " but I do n't want anybody fooling with that coonskin coat . " Her face twitched slightly . " I 'm going to work right now . We can do the breakfast dishes later . " Mrs. Crombie hated " doing the dishes " almost as much as she despised cooking . IN HIS PANELED LIBRARY , WITHthe door shut against intrusion , Mr. Crombie emptied the cartons onto the old floor boards . Occasionally he opened the door and tossed an empty carton into the hall just to let the world know he was n't browsing . Gradually , like a rising tide , their contents inundated the floor of the library , the fireplace , his desk , all available chairs , the empty bookshelves and the window sills . As he hurled the last box out and picked his way back into the room , he felt like a man standing in the exact center of his past life . Surrounding him was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hopes , celebrationsand disappointments . All were recorded in this un/organized mass of papers , photographs and clippings . Was it wise to preserve these things ? Who , other than himself , would ever care about them or even know their meaning ? Was n't it better to obliterate the trail as one went along ? He picked up a bundle of paper tubes held together with an ancient elastic band which immediately disintegrated . Selecting one , he unrolled it with difficulty . It was a panoramicpicture of his Twenty-fifth Reunion . Taking it to the window he cleared a chair and sat down to examine it more closely . There he was in the second row with Jinny . Lordy , she had been beautiful in those days  --  still was , as a matter of fact ; in a more autumnal way , of course . And there was Joe Sims . You 'd never know him now , God knows . That must be Skip Binger right behind him , looking a bit potted . He probably had been . Poor old Skip had certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better word . Well , that was something that would n't be thrown away . He released the edges of the picture , which immediately rolled itself back into a cylinder as if anxious to return to the oblivion from which it had been so briefly snatched . He picked up another tube . It was a picture of his World War I outfit taken " somewhere in France . " He had known all of these men intimately , lived with them day and night for months , damn near died with them a couple of times . Now he could n't even remember their names . All through the morning he burrowed like a mole into the past , rereading old letters , diaries , speeches , looking over dozens of loose photographs , thrown into boxes to await the day  --  which would never come  --  when someone would paste them into albums . It was like swimming backward in rime through waters in which he no longer belonged . Heaven knew what he was going to do with all this stuff , but certainly he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't throw his life into the scrap basket like so muchp150Christmas wrapping . No . That was what executors were for . They 'd get one look at this verbal compost heap and give it the old heave-ho . He hoped he would n't be hovering around like those people in the Topper book . Carefully , almost tenderly , he piled everything in the cabinets under the bookcases . Step two would be to go through it all some rainy day , putting everything into chronological order . For what ? For whom ? For his executors to throw away , of course . As the hours wore on he felt more like the curator of an ancient museum than a man embarking on a new life . Why did older people always prefer to look backward rather than forward ? Probably it was because they had too little future left to completely occupy their attention . At any rate it was a habit which he intended to fight . They belonged where they now were , The Private Papers of Graham Crombie , nesting undisturbed in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , but the unseen part  --  the part that pertained to his roots and not to the Graham Crombie who lived in the open air above ground . It was almost three o'clock . He went in search of Jinny who , dirty and disheveled , had been equally engrossed , although along radically different lines . " Well , did you weed out a lot of that rubbish ? " she asked as they ate their luncheon sandwiches in the cluttered kitchen . " Oh , yes , " he said vaguely , " quite a lot . " " I 'll bet you did n't get rid of one empty envelope , " she said . " You 're hopeless , but the library 's your department , not mine . Now I really accomplished something . As soon as you 've finished your lunch I want you to come up . " There was triumphant excitement in her voice . Men , thought Mr. Crombie , are basically collectors ; women , disposers , whether it be money or goods . This was too nebulous an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPARE ROOM LOOKED LIKE ANovercrowded attic . Mrs. Crombie glanced anxiously at him as he entered . " I know it seems like a lot to throw away , " she said defensively , " but this is all stuff that is broken or worn out . We just have no use for it . Now take this old rocker that used to be in the maid 's room . It 's all coming to pieces . We do n't want that , certainly . " " But it can be fixed , " said Mr. Crombie . " Surely you do n't throw things away just because they need a little glue . That 's just the kind of project I want for my workshop . " " But if you fix it  --  which I doubt if you ever will  --  what are you going to do with it ? We have n't any maid 's room either here or in the City  --  or any maid to rock in it . " " Listen dear , maids are n't the only people who like to rock . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " She 's dead . " " The trouble with you is you get a notion about something and that 's the end of it . You say rocking chairs are no longer fashionable so let 's take all the rockers down to the Salvation Army and get rid of them and then on the way home let 's stop at that antique shop and look at that cobbler 's bench and that darling little child 's cradle that would be just the thing for firewood in your study . ' You ... " " All right , all right , " interrupted Mrs. Crombie . " Putterp152with it if you want to , just as long as you get it down in the cellar , or wherever you think you 're going to do these things , so I can get this house in shape . " " That 's more like it , " said Mr. Crombie . " I 'm not set up down there yet , but I 'll put it somewhere in the meantime . Do n't tell me you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wedding present . " " Darling , it 's so scratched and battered that there 's no finish left on it . I would n't put it in a kennel . " " Why would you put a sewing table in a kennel ? All it needs is refinishing . I can scrape it and make it look like new . " " All right , " she said with a sigh , " if you want to fill the place with derelicts that you 're never going to do anything with , go ahead . " " What do you mean I 'm never going to do anything with ' ? " " Graham Crombie , you 've never handled a tool in your life . You 've never been able to hang a picture without knocking half the wall down . Now , God knows I want you to have your hobbies , but you seem to think that just because you have a big cellar to play around in you 're automatically a cabinetmaker . I do n't know anything about these things , but my common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to think . I have a feeling that if you do n't start slowly you 're going to get so discouraged you wo n't be fit to live with . Why do n't you do the little necessary things first ? For instance , there 's a broken sash cord on the spare-room window and there are about a dozen panes of glass that need fixing . Those are things that have to be done . If you want to save money , start on them . " " Listen , Jinny , you do n't understand . Today there are power tools . Do you know what I mean by power tools ? They do all the hard work for you and a child can handle them . And there are how to ' books that make the whole thing easy . You 're thinking of the old-fashioned cabinetmakers . Thep153hand-finishers . Now , do n't you worry , I 'll take the sewing table , too . " Piece by piece Mr. Crombie transferred much of the wreckage of their past to the back porch preparatory to taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the big attic . " What do we have an attic for , " he said . " Did n't you like to browse around old attics when you were a little girl ? Where 's the romance in a great big empty attic ? And all these old curtains and things . Kids love to dress up . This will be a regular costume shop . " " Darling , the kids have their own places now and their own things . " " It 's the grandchildren I mean  --  you have to make the place interesting for them if you want them to like it . " In the spacious front hall the movers had placed a big wooden settee with a high carved back embellished with a mirror and numerous hat pegs . " Gosh , " said Mr. Crombie . " I have n't seen that in thirty years . It used to be in the front hall of that house we had in Bronxville just after we were married . That really is a horror . Where 's it been all these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , " she said . " Well , we certainly can get rid of that  --  no argument on that one . And that about takes care of things , I guess . " She put her hand on the old dark wood . " I suppose it should go , " she said , " but it makes me sort of sad to say goodbyto it . It used to stand in our front hall in Cleveland when I was a little girl . I do n't know whether you remember that dark , ugly old house . It was a palace to me . " " I know , " he said firmly , " but the past is the past . Trying to hang onto it is one of the most dangerous things in the world , especially at our age . By the way , what did you do with my coonskin coat ? " " I hung it in the hall closet until I get a chance to spray itp154and put it in a new mothproof bag . Why ? Do you want to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's knock off , " he said . " We 've done enough for one day . " " LAST NIGHT I WORKED OUT Aschedule for myself , " said l4r . Crombie at breakfast . " If you do n't have some kind of a systematic plan you never get anythingaccomplished . " " I thought you told me we had all of eternity to get things done . " " That wo n't be long enough if we do n't get some order into our lives . It makes me nervous just to flop around like a codfish on a dock . First of all I 'm going to get up at a regular time every morning . Seven is about right . I 'll slip on an old T shirt and a pair of pants and take a fast walk down to the village for the paper . By the time I get back , shave and take a shower you 'll have breakfast ready . Now I think breakfast is important . It should be a nice , quiet meal . . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After breakfast I 'll take care of whatever letter-writing there may be . Then I want two uninterrupted hours for reading . I 've never had two uninterrupted hours to read in my life and I 'm going to begin right now . Then we 'll have a cocktail  --  just one  --  and lunch . After lunch , a half hour 's shuteye  --  nomore. "  |p155'Wait  a minute , " interrupted Mrs. Crombie . " When are you going to do all this ? " " I 'm beginning today , " he said . " Like fun you are . Not with all there is to be done around this place . Yesterday you put all that broken furniture that you 're going to fix out on the back porch . You said you were going to take it down to the barn or someplace . I do n't care where you take it , but I want to get that porch cleaned up . I have a hunch that in a town like this more people come in by the kitchen than by the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch ? " pleaded Mr. Crombie . " That 's my chore time . " " It could not , " she snapped . " There 'll be plenty of chores ' after lunch  --  and remember we 're leaving for New York at six . " All right , all right , " he said resignedly , " but there should be a rule  --  there must be a rule  --  once I get started nothing is to interfere with my morning schedule . " " As soon as we get this house settled , I 'll promise not to interrupt . you even if I drop dead . " 8MR . CROMBIE LOADED THE BROKENfurniture into the station wagon and drove down to the old barn . Since their arrival he had been too busy to inspect the barn . In fact , he had had no time to leave the house at allp156except to go down to the village for newspapers and the mail . His life in New York had been nomadic in comparison . The huge barn doors , built to admit a loaded hay wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull one open at the bottom far enough to insert a piece of board . Using this as a lever he pried the door open still farther and inserted a second board above the first . This was a most inconvenient way to open a barn door , but he was in the country now , where men must learn to contend with all sorts of things . As he pried the door open with the second board far enough to insert a third , he felt a glow of satisfaction that he , Graham Crombie , was able to meet a difficulty of this kind using the tools at hand . This was the way his ancestors had built America . As he put his weight on the third board there was a sound of splintering wood and what was left of the door swung open . Oh , well  --  it had to be fixed anyway . Just another project . It took him some moments to get used to the half-light inside the barn . A few rays of sunshine entered through the cracks between the sideboards tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left was an empty hayloft . Beneath it there had probably been stalls for cows . These had long since been ripped out , however , and the entire barn was filled with a conglomeration of shapeless objects . It was obviously an old structure ; probably older than the house . The rough ax-hewn beams were fitted one into the other and secured with wooden pegs . The floor boards , hacked and splintered by thousands of horseshoes , were even wider than those in his library . The whole place smelled of rotting wood , musty burlap , mice and age . A crude , homemade ladder led to the hayloft . Mr. Crombie climbed it cautiously . Near the edge lay an ancient Flexible Flyer with a crushed runner . Behind it was a picket gate , attached to a gatepost with long iron hinges . Gate to what ? Hep157climbed into the loft and stumbled over a rusty bar bell and an assortment of round weights . Why in the world would anyone need exercise in a place like this ? A number of posts which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacked in a corner . What porch ? Under a pile of boards the mildewed head of a rag doll protruded like a hurricane victim . Beside it was what looked like the top of a human skull . On closer inspection it turned out to be a battered white croquet ball . He descended to the floor of the barn without looking further . The first thing was to make room somewhere for the furniture in the station wagon . He had to think for a moment why it was he was storing it here anyway . An old rope swing which hung from an almost invisible rafter stirred uneasily as a sudden breeze blew in the open door . He started nervously , then smiled as if someone had been watching him . Picking his way to the nearest corner , he began to clear a space ; a broken doll carriage , a bicycle with the back wheel missing , an oar from a racing shell , an old wooden hayrake with most of the teeth missing . Leaning against the wall behind them was an atrocious oil painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so bad it might be valuable . He reminded himself of an archaeologist uncovering layers of civilizations . This was not his place at all . He was an interloper , a trespasser on other people 's property . He could almost feel the presence of past generations staring at him angrily from dark corners , chin-whiskered farmers , little girls in sunbonnetsand pantalettes , bronzed young college athletes , little boys with bubble gum . . . ' What are you doing here , old man ? This is our barn . Get out and leave our stuff alone . " Quickly , almost apologetically , he unloaded the furniture from the station wagon , piled it in the corner and hurried out into the sunlight . The brook ran close to the southern end of the barn andp158between it and the barn he noticed a half-obliterated path . He followed it , pushing aside the brambles with his legs . Behind the barn , half-buried by weeds and young bushes , were the foundations of what must have been a chicken house . Nearby were the ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses had fallen in and the few remaining shingles were green with moss . The runways were still marked by a few rotting posts and shreds of sagging chicken wire . He followed the path to a point where it crossed the stream on flat rocks . On the other side it disappeared into the woods through a tangle of briars . Ahead of him in the fork of a big sycamore were the remains of a tree house . The climbing-cleats , nailed to its shaggy sides , were already halfabsorbedby the bark . Scattered everywhere among the sumac bushes were old boxes , broken camp chairs and rotting posts . Under a blanket of brambles a battered sawbuck lay on its side . He managed to pull it free . He would need this for sawing up firewood . The sun was warm in the sheltered clearing , the gurgle of the brook pleasantly soporific . He crossed on the flat stones and sat down with his back against the sycamore . All this mess would have to be cleared out . It was a Gargantuan task , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firewood for the winter . Once cleaned out , it occurred to him that it might be a likely spot on which to build a shack ; a place where he could get off by himself and think , secure from interruption . At that moment he saw Mrs. Crombie 's head appear around the corner of the barn . She was shielding her eyes with her hand and apparently looking for something . " Gray , " she called , and there was a note of panic in her voice . He hesitated a moment . " Yes , " he called back , rather crossly . " For heaven 's sake , Gray , where have you been ? You hadp159me scared half to death . The station wagon has been standing there for an hour with the doors open and you nowhere around . " " Do I have to be around when the station wagon doors are open ? " " Do n't try to be funny , dear . I was really worried . There are so many things that could happen to a person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing back here ? " " Looking the estate over , " he said , getting to his feet . ' Well , you 'll have to look it over some other time . That damn Iittle pump in the cellar has stopped working and we have no water . " 9 " THE PUMP , EH ? " SAID MR . BARN  --  hauser , the real-estate agent . " Well , it was about due to go . Them people never took no care of things . I 'll tell Guernsey to come over and slip in a stand-by pump while he 's ordering you a new one . Got to have some water pressure somehow . " " What do you mean while he 's ordering a new one ' ? I thought you said the mechanical equipment was all O.K. and that the people who had owned the house always kept everythingup . " " The pump 's O.K. , " said Mr. Barnhauser , " but O.K. don'tmean things do n't wear out . That 's a good little pump . Best there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Who 's Guernsey ? " asked Mr. Crombie suspiciously . " Guernsey Le Bleu ? " said Mr. Barnhauser . " He 's the plumber that 's handled your house all his life . His pa and his granpa before him  --  only his granpa was n't a plumber . He was a carpenter , if you know what I mean . Folks has changed things around so often on this place , shiftin ' em here and shiftin ' em there , that Guernsey 's the only one knows where anything is . " " Is he any good ? " " Guernsey , you mean ? " said Mr. Barnhauser as if they had been discussing a number of alternatives . " Oh , Guernsey 's all right . He 's a bit excitable sometimes . Apt to go off his rocker if he gets crossed up . But he 's a good plumber all right . Whether he is or not , he 's the only one what understands where anything is . " " Well , send him right up , will you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnhauser . " I 'll get him to drop whatever job he 's on . Do n't make no difference how important it is . " An hour later a battered Cadillac limousine tore into the driveway and came to a skidding halt . A little man , so smeared with oil and grease that it was difficult to distinguish his features , slid out from behind the wheel and approached the kitchen door , where Mr. Crombie was waiting for him . " I 'm Guernsey Le Bleu , " he said in such a loud voice that Mr. Crombie instinctively took a step backward . " Bit deaf . Do n't hear good . Bad ears . Barnhauser says old water pump 's finally give out . Fell apart . Done in . " " When I bought this place they told me it was in first-class condition , " shouted Mr. Crombie . Mr. Le Bleu made a sound like a sheep that has bitten into some bad-tasting weeds . " Ai n't been no good for years , " he said . " Not much good when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on a box and pulled out a pipe which he proceeded to fill carefullyfrom a dirty envelope.  | " Got a nice place here , " he said , " if you ever get it in shape . Last owners did n't care about nothin ' but fishin ' and huntin ' and likkerin ' up . Used to be good fishin ' and huntin ' around here . Not so good now . Too many people . Overpopulated . Was a time , though , when a man or a boy could go out . . . " Half an hour later Mr. Le Bleu , having expounded at length on the past glories of the town of Highfield , was launched on a detailed description of the shortcomings of Sunset Hill 's former owners . Mr. Crombie could find no suitable place to interrupt . Remembering what Mr. Barnhauserhad said about Mr. Le Bleu 's tendency to abandon his rocker if crossed up , he decided that the situation did not warrant taking any unnecessary chances . Finally sheer weariness , caused by leaning against the doorpost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about the pump ? " he shouted . " We have no water . " Mr. Le Bleu frowned . He had obviously been crossed up . " Do n't worry your head , " he said . " Stop worryin ' . Loosen up . Relax . I 'll put in a stand-by for now . Take three-four weeks get a new one . Buncha drag-heels . Dopey . Dumb . " " Do you think we have to have a new pump ? " " Oh , sure . Three-four weeks . Then you get it . Good pump . A-I . Mr. Le Bleu rose from the box reluctantly and removed a huge kit of tools from the rear seat of the Cadillac . " Tools , " he said , stamping imaginary mud from his feet before entering the kitchen . " Morning , ma'am . " " Good morning , " said Mrs. Crombie . " I do hope you 're going to get us some water pretty soon . " " How much does a new pump cost ? " shouted Mr. Crombie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . " Mighty pretty weather for June , " he said , snapping on the stair light . " We 'll have this bugger out in a jiffy . Right away . Quick . "  |p162Mr  . Crombie followed him into the cellar . He watched Mr. Le Bleu for some time in silence . " Can I get anything for this pump in trade ? " he asked timidly . Mr. Le Bleu , already furiously at work disconnecting pipes and unscrewing bolts , gave his sheep cry , which Mr. Crombie interpreted to mean that no one in his right mind would give him a nickel . Mr. Crombie hoped there might be some mention of what the new pump was going to cost , but Mr. Le Bleu was so absorbed in ripping the old one apart and creating general chaos that it did n't seem to matter very much , so he went upstairs . Mr. Le Bleu made frequent trips to the Cadillac and each time he paused to shout a word of encouragement . " Not long now . Pretty soon . Poco pronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally appeared wiping his hands on a bit of oily rag which he laid on the kitchen drainboard . " Think you got a leak in line to artesian , " he said . " Ca n't tell . Do n't know . Do n't worry . Get it fixed quick . Ought to be pressure now in half-hour . If gauge do n't go up to fifty pounds let me know . Somethin ' wrong . Leak . Nice to meet you . " He disappeared , leaving an oily smudge on the knob of the door . ' Well , I certainly hope that whatever it is goes up goes up , " said Mrs. Crombie . " I never thought about water before . I always took it for granted . Turn on the tap and there it is waiting to leap out at you like that Moses affair . By the way , where is the artesian well ? " " I do n't know , " said Mr. Crombie miserably . " I just never thought to ask . " " Well , what does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round place with a roof over it and a pulley  --  you know what I mean . Old-oaken-bucket stuff . There 's certainly nothing like that around here . "  | " I think an artesian well is some kind of pipe , " said Mr. Crombie , uncertainly . " We 'll have to find out about that . " " Fine time to be finding out , " snorted Mrs. Crombie . " Anyway , you tell that greaseball that we 've got to have some water . " Mr. Crombie made frequent trips to the cellar . The wheel on the side of the little pump was whirling around at what seemed to him alarming speed , but there was no response from the pressure gauge . At the end of an hour he phoned Mr. Le Bleu . Mrs. Le Bleu did n't know where her husband was , but she 'd tell him the minute he came in . No , she did n't know when he was coming home . She thought he was working on the school job . Two hours later there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that the Iittle pump became silent . It was dark outside when Mr. Le Bleu finally appeared . " Burned out my stand-by , " he shouted . " Never mind . Old . No good . Leak somewhere . " There was a hole high up in the cellar wall through which an assortment of pipes escaped into the darkness . Mr. Le Bleu produced a long flashlight , climbed up on a box and started to insert his body into the hole . It gave Mr. Crombie claustrophobia just to watch . " Where are you going ? " he asked anxiously . Mr. Le Bleu , already inside the hole , turned his head and looked under his arm . " Got to look at artesian well . Leak someplace . No compression . On the bum . " " Where is the well ? " Mr. Le Bleu slid back out of the hole . In the half-darkness of the cellar Mr. Crombie could only see the whites of his eyes shining like dim lamps in his blackened face . " Used to be out behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new wing doggone architect built it right over well . It 's right under one of them beds . Just dug a crawl space big enough for a snake . Too small . No good . Pfui. "  |p164He  hoisted his body up to the hole once more and , like a lizard entering its cave , slowly disappeared . Mr. Crombie climbed up on the box and followed his progress by the reflectedglow of the flashlight . The thought of Mr. Le Bleu entrapped under the floor of the downstairs spare room was disturbing . He would have to rip up the flooring to save him . How in the world did one rip up a floor ? And if Mr. Le Bleu died in there .. . " Are you all right ? " he shouted . There was no answer , but a distant metallic clanking indicated that at least the worst had not yet happened . Could it be that Mr. Le Bleu was signaling for help , the way trapped submarine crews hammered their S.O.S. messages on the side of the hull ? He almost shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight finally shone in his face , indicating that the return journey had commenced . In due course his dirtsmearedhead appeared once more in the opening . " Take the flashlight , " he said . " Got to turn ' round and come out way I went in . Backassward . " The man seemed to be made of rubber . As his feet touched the box , Mr. Crombie restrained an impulse to seize him by the hand and congratulate him on his escape . " Foot valve 's gone , " said Mr. Le Bleu . " Rusted out . Rotted . Kefui . " " What 's the foot valve ? " shouted Mr. Crombie . He felt as if he might be going to throw up . " Bottom o ' the well . Pump sucks water through tube . Valve shuts . Else water runs right back into well . Understand ? See ? Nothin ' to worry about . " " But what do we do now ? " " New valve , " said Mr. Le Bleu . " Got ta pull old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pipe 's right under floor . Got ta dig a hole under foundation of house . Dig a little room underp165floor . See ? Line it with concrete blocks so 's we can git at it again if we hafta . Cut off pipe . Pull up foot valve . Not bad . Might be worse . " " But who 's going to do all this ? " " Son-in-law , " said Mr. Le Blue , promptly . " Mason . Plasterer . Good boy . Busy now on new school . Get him around soon 's I can . Quick . Prompt . " " But what are we going to do for water ? " There was a quaver in Mr. Crombie 's voice . Mr. Le Bleu pushed back his cap and scratched his head . " Well , " he said , " neighbors 'll be glad to lend you a few pails . Emergency . Everybody help . Got any place you could go ? " " We are going to New York tonight for a day or so , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Have yourself a time . Gay white way . Relax . Enjoy it . Come back . All done . Finished . Complete . Good as new . " " But how much is all this going to cost ? " asked Mr. Crombie . Mr. Le Bleu was gathering up his tools . " Son-in-law 's just had a baby , " he said . " Boy . Son . Got three nice kids . One 's a little backward . Be all right . O.K. Mother 's not so hot herself . Well , do n't worry . All fixed up when you get back . " " Perhaps instead of coming back on Wednesday night we ought to stay in town until that awful man is sure everything 's running right , " said Mrs. Crombie . She seemed to accept this alternative quite philosophically . ' We 'll give him a ring Wednesday , " said Mr. Crombie . When they phoned Mr. Le Bleu he was in fine spirits . " O.K. , " he said cheerily . " All done . Fixed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No more trouble . Had a little accident , though . Nothin ' much . Little thing . Must have jarred house , poundin ' . Living-room ceiling let go . Came down . Nothin ' hurt . Just a couple little china things . Made the placep166a mite dirty . Moved furniture into dining room . Son-in-law 's comin ' tomorrow . Good plasterer . O.K. Top grade . Come back any time . Everythin ' workin ' . Hunkeydory . That old ceiling 's been due to fall for years . Lucky you was n't sittin ' under it . Good break . " " If we stay in New York any longer , " said Mr. Crombie , " that man will have the whole house flat on the ground . We 're going back . " FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS THEY ATEin the kitchen . Mr. Le Bleu 's son-in-law , an enormous , Samsonesqueyoung man , who always stripped to the waist before he commenced work , had built a low platform on the livingroomfloor which enabled him to reach the ceiling without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster dust , had been moved into the dining room , where it lay piled , one piece on top of another . " These are the days , " said Mrs. Crombie , " to get everything else in the house set . Then , when Muscles gets through admiringhis torso in the mirror , we can fix up the living room and were in . " Each day they worked like galley slaves from early morning until the sun began to sink across the valley . Then they also sank , exhausted , into the big wooden chairs on the terrace to watch the western sky put on its evening show behind the hills . The valley was filled with a smoky haze . The silence wasp167unbroken save for the sound of the brook gurgling nervously to itself as it hurried across the lawn to seek refuge in the woods . " I can hardly believe it , " he said . " A month ago I was a businessman ; an office slave . Now I 'm free ; free as the birds . And we own this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living-room ceiling has been a little discouraging , of course , but we were foolish to think that you can buy an old place like this and not find something the matter with it . " He tossed the ice cubes out of the two slender-stemmed glasses and filled them from the pitcher . Sipping contentedly , he gazed across the valley . " Pretty nice , " he murmured . " Pretty nice . " Whether he meant the view or the cocktail did n't really matter . " It is lovely , " agreed Mrs. Crombie . " You know , if it was n't for cooking dinner and washing up afterward it would even be wonderful not having a maid . " " I know what you mean , " said Mr. Crombie . " Eat whenever you want to . " " Providing you can find something to eat . I 'm so tired , the thought of getting supper makes me ill . " Mr. Crombie sipped his martini with the expression of a man weighing a heavy problem . " There must be some stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I 'm so stiff from wrassling junk in that barn that all I want is a couple of these and a hot bath . " She sank back in her chair as if Mr. Crombie 's remark had relieved her of further responsibility . They sat in silence watching the valley shadows grow deeper . She made a sudden slap at her forehead . " Do n't tell me , " she said . " If there are mosquitoes in this place I ca n't bear it . " " I have n't felt any , " said Mr. Crombie . " Imagination , I guess . Psychosomatic . I asked Barnhauser about them when we bought the house and he said most of the natives up herep168did n't know what mosquitoes were . " A moment later he slapped his ear violently and then his ankle . " Good gracious , " he said , " the place is alive with them  --  all of a sudden . " " Where in the world did they come from ? Hold still , there 's one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sent half the contents of his glass over the stones of the terrace . " Sorry , " she said . " We ca n't stay out here , that 's certain . Let 's finish our drinks in the kitchen . " They sat dejectedly on either side of the metal kitchen table . " The one thing we bought this place for was that view , " said Mr. Crombie , " and now we can only look at it through the window on account of the goddam mosquitoes . " She did not reply for several minutes . " Do you know what I 'm afraid we 'll have to do ? " she said finally . " We 'll have to build a screen porch on part of the terrace . Then we could sit there in any kind of weather , regardless of mosquitoes or tornadoes or what disasters have you . " " We could eat out there , too , " he said , turning the idea over in his mind . " That might be pretty good . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rain you do n't have to herd people into a hot , stuffy house like cattle . " " We could build a chimney at one end for cookouts , " he said . " And then you could do the cooking . Men always do the cooking outdoors . You could have a big apron with funny jokes written all over it and I 'd never have to go near that damn stove again . " " I 've always thought I 'd like to be able to cook a few things well , " he said . " Specialties . You know . " " I wonder who does that kind of work around here ? " she said . " What kind of work ? Specialties ? "  | " Building screen porches . " " Mr. Le Bleu 's son-in-law , I suppose . I 'd like to get this out of the family , though , so we can be sure that while one relative is working he does n't bust something up for the next relative to fix . I 'll check up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village today . Name of Battle  --  Oswald Battle . Came here for his health about thirty years ago . Runs a little antique shop , but I guess it 's mostly to give him a place to get away from his wife . He 's a great talker . Knows everybody . I 'll check with him tomorrow . " " Do n't go hog wild , " she said , picking up the pitcher and the glasses . " We seem to be running up quite a lot of expense . Well , I suppose if we 're going to eat we 'd better face it  --  unless you just want a hot bath , the way you said . " MR . BATTLE WAS ENTHUSIASTICabout the idea . He not only knew of a contractor who would be just the man for building a screened porch , but he also thought he might possibly be able to lay his hands on some porch furniture of distinction . He had in mind a chap by the name of Charlie Crumb to do the building . Quite an unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd save money . ( Mr. Crombie could n't remember hearing about the first place . ) Well-read fellow , too . Quite a philosopher . Mr. Battle would bring him around that afternoon . The two of them arrived just about cocktail time . Duringp170the day Mr. and Mrs. Crombie had moved the furniture back into the living room . " I guess we 'll have to sit inside on account of the mosquitoes , " she apologized . " Looks like a good place to sit , " said Mr. Crumb , sinking into Mr. Crombie 's favorite chair . He was a frail , wispy little man with a bulbous forehead who looked more like a professor from a small-time college than a contractor . Mr. Crombie came in carrying a tray with four glasses . " Nothing for me , " said Mr. Crumb , holding up his hand like a traffic cop . " Hardly ever touch it and we 're only going to stay a minute . I got to get home to supper . " " Same with me , " said Mr. Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out wondering what 's become of me . Great worrier , Mrs. Battle . " " Why do n't you telephone your wives and tell them to come over ? " suggested Mrs. Crombie . " Oh , no , " said Mr. Battle in alarm . " No , that would n't do at all . I 'll just take a little one and hurry along . " " That 's me , too , " said Mr. Crumb . " Just a little one for sociability 's sake . " Mr. Crombie gave them each a brimming glass and they settled back contentedly . " It 's very good of NIr . Battle to bring you over , " said Mr. Crombie . " We 've been thinking about adding a screen porch . . . . " " Do you remember that screen porch of old Mrs. Meadows ? " asked Mr. Crumb , addressing his question to no one in particular . " The screening got so old it rusted out , so her husband took it off entirely . But he did n't say nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she set great store by that screen porch . " ' Well , sir , she never noticed the screenin ' was gone and she used to set out there every evenin ' an ' the funny thing was that the mosquitoes had become so used to the screenin ' thatp171they just assumed it was still there and never tried to come in . " Mrs. Crombie was too absorbed in her immediate problems to appreciate this bit of folklore . " Do you have mosquitoes here all summer ? " she asked . " Oh , lordy , yes , " said Mr. Crumb . " But that Meadows outfit were a queer lot . They had a daughter .... " By seven-thirty Mr. Crombie had taken the martini pitcher out to the kitchen twice . From time to time he tried to bring up the subject of the porch , but Mr. Crumb and Mr. Battle were too busy discussing their intimate friends and neighbors , most of whom appeared to be either fools or knaves . The phone rang . " It 's for you , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my , my , " he said nervously , " it 's probably Mrs. Battle . I know it is . Wo n't you tell her we 've just left and I 'll be home in about five minutes ? " " But we have n't talked about the porch , " said Mr. Crombie . Mr. Crumb gave him a puzzled look as if trying to recall something . " Oh , the porch , " he said , his face relaxing . " I 'll be up in the morning with my stone mason an ' we 'll take the measurements . " " But I 've got to know what it 's going to cost before we go ahead . " " Absolutely , " said Mr. Crumb . " Sound business . We 'll do it on a cost-plus basis . That 's the best way on a job like this where you do n't know just what you 're runnin ' into . Saves you money . Saves me money . " " I 'll tell you one thing , " said Mr. Battle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the valley . " " That ai n't necessarily sayin ' much , " said Mr. Crumb . They both gave hearty exit laughs and prepared to leave . " Come on , " urged Mr. Battle . " I 'm going to get hell . " ' What you worryin ' about , " said Mr. Crumb . " You 'd get hell  --  anyways.  --   |p172MR  . CRUMB AND HIS ASSISTANTappeared the next morning while Mr. and Mrs. Crombie were having breakfast . Mr. Crumb introduced Mr. Salvatore , who shook hands all around . " We do n't want to disturb you folks , " said Mr. Crumb . " Just tell us where you want the porch an ' we 'll go out and have a look around . " " We want to put it right off the end of the living room , where the terrace is , " said Mrs. Crombie . " Datsa good place , " said Mr. Salvatore , beaming amiably . " Maka fine porch . All terrazzo . " " We do n't want terrazzo . We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace now . " Mr. Salvatore looked hurt . " No terrazzo ? " he said . " Those are details , " interrupted Mr. Crumb . " We 'll just go and measure things up . " The Crombies finished their breakfast hastily . " Let 's get out there , " said Mrs. Crombie , " before they begin building it out of concrete , encrusted with seashells . " Little stakes had been driven at each corner of the terrace . Mr. Salvatore was stretching a white string between them . " We 're goin ' to pull up all this old stone and give you somethingnice , " said Mr. Crumb . " This stuff is no good . Old field stone , most of it . "  | " But we like it , " said Mrs. Crombie , " and besides we do n't want a porch as big as the terrace . " " We just want a small porch where we can sit and maybe eat , with a chimney at one end so we can cook out , " added Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously puzzled . " Ca n't usa these stone anyway . Got ta build platform twothreeinches high so'sa water ca n't run in . Maka nice floor . Different colored stones . . . " " But we do n't want different colored stones , " said Mr. Crombie . " Just plain flagstones laid in concrete . Plain . Understand ? Plain flagstones . The whole thing should n't be more than so big . " He paced it off . " How much do you estimate for that ? " Mr. Crumb , obviously disgruntled to find the job diminishingto chicken-coop proportions , figured rapidly for several minutes on an old envelope . " About $3,000 , " he said , " maybe more , maybe less . We 'll do it cost-plus , then you wo n't have to worry . " " Three thousand dollars ! " cried Mr. Crombie , dismayed . " What amount did you have in mind ? " asked Mr. Crumb coldly . Mr. Crombie looked despondent . " I guess I did n't have anything in mind , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " Mr. Crumb relaxed . " Time was when you could build a little cottage for three thousand dollars . " Mr. Crumb and Mr. Salvatore , concluding that this must be some kind of a crazy city dweller 's joke , laughed politely . " While you 're at it , " said Mr. Crumb , " you might as well have nylon screening . Latest thing . Practically invisible . Never rusts . " " That would be nice , " said Mrs. Crombie . " Screen porches always make me feel as if I was in a cage . " " We 'll use hand-split shingles on the roof like is on thep174house and hand-hewn beams doctored up to look old like the rest of the house . " The Crombies agreed this would also be nice . " And we can cut an entrance right into your livin ' room here . Look nice with a Dutch door . And then you 'll need lightin ' . Base plugs all round and some kind of a handsome fixture comin ' down from the ridgepole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can lay my hands on a beauty . And carriage lamps either side of the door gain ' out to the terrace . Got a fine pair at the shop . " " Got ta put some drains on terrace , " said Mr. Salvatore , " elsa water back up . Got ta dig a dry well . " " Wo n't all that cost an awful lot of money ? " asked Mr. Crombie . " Gracious no , " said Mr. Crumb , reassuringly . " What I always say is , if you 're goin ' to have somethin ' then have somethin ' good , not somethin ' you 'll be ashamed of . " " Datsa right , " nodded Mr. Salvatore . " We builda da fine porch . You no be ' shamed . " " How long will it take ? " asked Mr. Crombie , feeling like a bug whirling helplessly toward a drainpipe . Mr. Crumb scratched his head and looked appraisingly at Mr. Salvatore . " Well , let 's see . I 'm tied up a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go to work right away . You ca n't build the porch till you build the founda-tions . " When they had gone , Mrs. Crombie dropped into a chair on the terrace . Mr. Crombie paced nervously back and forth over the despised field stones . " Listen , dear , " she said . " Do n't get so upset . This is n't just a whim . We have to have a porch . " " Nobody 's had to have a porch up to now and the house has been here for a hundred and seventy years , " he said . " Why do we have to be the fall guys ? "  |p175'Well  , the people before us must have had citronella for blood , " she said . " I tell you a porch is a must , Gray . We 've put a lot of money into this house and we certainly want to be able to sit outside without being eaten alive . What 's a few thousand dollars after all you 've poured into it ? " He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind . " I 'm going to clear out some more of that rubbish behind the barn , " he said , finally . " If we 're going broke , we might as well be tidy about it . " A WEEK LATER MR . LE BLEU APpearedin his Cadillac . Mr. Salvatore and two assistants were busy making a mess of the formerly neat terrace . " Addin ' on ? " asked Mr. Le Bleu , hopefully . " Buildin ' somethin ' ? Expandin ' ? " " No , no , just a little screened porch , " said Mr. Crombie casually , hoping to dispel any notions that might be forming in Mr. Le Bleu 's mind that the village had discovered a new Comstock lode . Mr. Le Bleu nodded . " Come to check furnace , " he said . " Clean out tubes . Boiler . Go over compressor . Ai n't been done for years . Poor economy . Do n't pay . " He disappeared into the cellar , emerging from time to time to fetch additional supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he finally came up for the last timep176covered with black soot . " Judgin ' by what I took out of the bugger , " he shouted , " system ai n't been cleaned since it was put in . All clear now . Drink out of it . Condenser 's all shot , though . Get you a new one . Old condenser never was much good . New kind last you a lifetime . Lot of your couplin 's wore out . Comin ' back tomorrow . " He stood halfway through the kitchen door scratching his head while holding his greasy cap between his thumb and forefinger . Mr. Crombie had already learned that when Mr. Le Bleu hesitated something cataclysmic was apt to be in process of gestation . " Spose you know that furnace 's too small , " he said . " Been tellin ' ' em that for years . Tryin ' to save money . Economize . Pfui . " " What do you mean it 's too small ? " asked Mr. Crombie belligerently , but with a sinking heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to heat the whole town with tea kettle . Heats old part O.K.

" " Pfui , " said Mr. Le Bleu . " Ten radiators ai n't no good , ai n't no steam in ' em . Furnace 's in wrong place . Ought a be over in other corner . Might help if I change all the valves . Old kind . Never was no good . Ca n't get at ' em anyway . All that panelin ' around radiators . Got ta come tomorrow . Nice day . Too hot . Muggy . " " I wonder if it would n't be cheaper , " said Mr. Crombie , when Mr. Le Bleu had departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull this old wreck down and then build ourselves a split level . " " Darling , you always get so depressed when things don'tp177go just right . You know , I 'm beginning to think that plumber has something the matter with his own valves . " " Anybody that hangs around this place long enough is bound to have , " said Mr. Crombie . HE WAS WEEDING THE FLOWERand bush beds outside the kitchen window . His neat mind had always looked forward to weeding a garden . One 's businesslife was bound to be more or less overgrown with unfinishedprojects , loose ends , things which must be made to fit even though they did n't . And there was nothing you could do about it . By contrast , a garden offered something sharply defined , tangible , where through quiet concentration one might achieve at least a momentary perfection of clean brown earth and flowers . It was a perfection which did not last , of course , but its realization , if only for an instant , brought a sense of peace by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't have to go to New York every Monday evening . There was so much to be done around Sunset Hill that a man needed a ten-day week to do it all instead of the four or five days that they spent here . And even though they did n't start for the City until six o'clock in order to have a full working day , the preliminaries to starting seemed to carve out a large slice of the afternoon for some reason or other.  | " Gray , if you 're going off in the woods someplace be back here by four o'clock . " " Why four , dear , if we 're not starting until six ? " " Because it takes you half an hour to let go what you are doing and the best part of an hour to scrub yourself and get into your store clothes and then you 've got to pack your own overnight bag . I 'm too busy . " " I do n't see why you have to fuss so , " he complained . " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will spoil and I have to have some clothes in town and there 's a mountain of stuff to go to the cleaners . Oh , do n't try to understand . Just take my word for it and pack your own bag . " They had finally settled on an ancient tavern about halfwaybetween Highfield and New York . The food was good , but the service was bad , as a result of which it was usually ten-thirty before they reached their destination at either end . " It 's like having a hundred and four evenings a year chopped off your life and thrown away , " said Mrs. Crombie as she climbed wearily into bed at the end of the journey . " By the way , I found a note from Jane Marbury asking us to dinner on Thursday and to go to the theater afterward . Do n't you think we could stay in Thursday and go back to the Hill Friday ? " " But that 's what we did last week . We 'll never get anythingdone " " Nonsense , " she snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart he was inclined to agree with her . What it all added up to was that they lived in two places , each of which made full-time demands on them that must be met on a halftimebasis.  |p179THE  CROMBIES HAD FRIENDS INLitchfield , Connecticut , who were not only inveterate gardeners , but who also seemed to have solved the riddle of keeping perfection static . No weed was ever visible in their immaculateflower beds . For them grass grew like a lush carpet where grass was supposed to grow , but no blade had the temerity to encroach upon the areas where grass was taboo . The turf bordering the graveled walks was cut with ruler straightness and even the trees co-operated in the general discipline by failing to develop any dead branches . These were the standards that Mr. Crombie had set for himself , but they were not easy to live up to . In fact , like everything else in this new life , simple things , like weeding , seemed to be full of technical problems which only experts could solve . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always popping out of the earth . If one pulled them up they proved to be flowers . If one let them continue popping , they popped as weeds . Grass also had an irritating way of sprouting right in the midst of things that properly belonged there , as a result of which it had to be plucked out blade by blade . Then , again , it was quiet and peaceful to sit on the grass with outstretched legs and weed the front portion of a bed , but when one came to grips with the rear areas the situationp180was quite different . Sitting down was then obviously out of the question . You had to stand , legs apart , bent over like a grazing giraffe . Giraffes , however , were used to this sort of thing . They were brought up that way . But after fifteen minutes the effect on retired men was excruciatingly painful . Bushes presented their own particular problems . They were a natural sanctuary , for instance , for last fall 's dried leaves which , with the solicitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their inner branches . The only way to get them out was to lie flat on one 's face and reach under with clawing fingers . Each handful removed disclosed a new nest nearer the center and when you pulled yourself stiffly to your feet , it was usually to discover that you had been lying on a clump of iris . It was the edging , however , which really defeated him . No matter how carefully he stretched his strings , his half-moon cutter would eventually tear out a clod of weeds , leaving a deep nick in the nice straight edge . Each time he was forced to cut back a little farther in order to straighten out former blemishes . It was quite apparent that even at this slow rate of attrition the entire property must ultimately be reduced to one great flower bed . On this particular morning , as he grubbed for crumbling leaves between the back of a lilac bush and the foundations of the house , his pre-retirement philosophy about gardening began to undergo a subtle change . Instead of symbolizing basic order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living creature which fought nature in this absurd way . The birds and the beasts accepted things as they were and utilized them in their daily lives . The little creatures of the forest and fields did n't run themselves ragged trying to remove dead leaves from under bushes or pulling up weeds from the meadows . All these things belonged where nature had placed them and man merely proved what a muttonhead hep181was by stubbornly refusing to acknowledge this obvious fact . Thus bemused he heard a voice issuing through the screen of the kitchen window like a muted radio . " Gray , where are you ? Gray . For heaven 's sake . There 's a woman coming up the driveway in a convertible . She 's getting out . She 's dressed up like Astor 's pet horse . Come quick ! " Welcoming the excuse to stand upright , Mr. Crombie placed his garden tools in the basket and walked around the end of the house . His face was covered with grime through which rivulets of sweat had cut brown channels . His hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves in his hair . Mrs. Crombie in a torn sweater , her hair disheveled , was talking to a smartly dressed woman just outside the kitchen door . As she saw Mr. Crombie roundingthe corner her face became so contorted by dismay that the stranger turned to ascertain the cause . " Oh , Gray , " she said accusingly , " this is Mrs. Partridge . " " Miss Partridge , " corrected the lady . " Of course . I 'm so sorry . Miss Partridge is being kind enough to call on us . She lives right over the hill . " She waved her hand vaguely . " I ca n't tell you how embarrassed I am , Miss Partridge , to have you find us in this condition . You see , we have no maid .... " " I have no maid , either , " said Miss Partridge in a tone which indicated that in spite of this she did not go around looking like a comedy tramp . One fleeting but nonetheless comprehensive appraisal of her trim tweeds had already told Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daily life were like . She belonged to the cool ones . " We really are n't quite settled yet , but you must come in . The house is a mess  --  but we love the dear old place already , " she added , hastily , sensing that when one lived in a town like Highfield one loved old houses . " I 'll go around and open the front door for you . "  | " Not at all , " said Miss Partridge , crisply . " I always come in through the kitchen . Everyone in Highfield comes in through the kitchen . " She walked through the cluttered confusion and Mrs. Crombie was miserably aware that no detail escaped her guest 's keen eyes . " For heaven 's sake go and wash , " she hissed . " We 'll be in the living room , dear , " she said , more loudly . Miss Partridge sat stiffly on the edge of the sofa and took a swift inventory of the room . " You have some nice things , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid not , " said Mrs. Crombie . " It 's a reproduction we bought just after we were married . " Miss Partridge lost interest . " What in the world is that platform affair you 're building at the end of the house ? " she asked . " That 's going to be a screened porch , " said Mrs. Crombie , eagerly . " We 're going to cut a doorway leading to it in that corner of the living room . We 're thrilled about it . " " A screened porch ? " Miss Partridge 's disbelieving voice could not have been more incredulous if Mrs. Crombie had said they were building a " two holer . " " This is a New England Historical Society marked house , you know . " " I know , " said Mrs. Crombie , " we 're very proud of that . " Her face fell . " Is n't it all right to build a screened porch on a New England Historical Society marked house ? " " Well , if you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't quite belong . " " But the mosquitoes in the evening . . . " Mrs. Crombie 's voice broke . " There were mosquitoes here when all these old houses were built , " said Miss Partridge , " but people did n't put on screened porches . It 's your house , of course , to do with as you want and it 's presumptuous of me to even mention it , but I 'm afraid Highfield people all feel they have a kind of proprietaryinterest in these old places . You 'll probably hear ap183few squawks , but just do n't pay any attention to them . You 've got to go ahead now , with the foundation half done . People know you 're new here and they 'll understand . " Mrs. Crombie was crushed . " I could n't be sorrier , " she said . " We never thought . We wanted a place where we could sit out in the evenings and maybe eat out occasionally . We just never thought about what it would do to the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Miss Partridge . " When people see it they 'll probably all build screened porches on their houses . This is just a fussy , ingrown old town , that 's all . You know there 's a saying around here that in most communities a house is a home , but in Highfield it 's a profession . Could we look around a bit ? I know the place so well I 'd like to see how you 've fixed it up . " At the head of the stairs they could hear Mr. Crombie singingin the shower . " This is our bedroom , " said Mrs. Crombie . " We love it . It 's so big . And in the morning the sun just floods in . " Miss Partridge seated herself in a chair by the window . " This room has n't changed one iota since Alice died in it . You did n't know Alice Clayton , did you ? Of course not . She was my closest friend . This was her room . I used to come in every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oldest families in Highfield . Alice 's greatgrandfather . . . " She lost herself in the chronicles of the Clayton family . Mrs. Crombie sat uneasily on the edge of the bed , wishing Graham would n't bellow so in bathrooms just because they made his voice resonant. " . . . and then one day the end came while I was sitting just where I am now . " Miss Partridge , overcome , began pawing through her handbag . Mrs. Crombie handed her a paper handkerchief from a box on the bedside table . At that moment the bathroom door opened and Mr. Crombie , still singing , strode into the room in the starko . Miss Partridge gave out something between a sob andp184a gasp . " Good God , " said Mr. Crombie simply . Turning with dignity he re-entered the bathroom and shut the door softly . " Do n't worry about it another minute , " said Miss Partridge as Mrs. Crombie followed her to her car . " I should n't have dropped in at this time of day without letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , especially on new neighbors . I 'll give you a ring soon and put on a little dinner so you can get acquainted with some of the nice people who live around here . Say good-by to Mr. Crombie . I 'm sorry I did n't see more of him . " MISS PARTRIDGE WAS RIGHT . HIGHfieldwas a great place for calling . Mr. Crombie learned to keep an eye out for strange , shiny automobiles . When he saw one turn in the drive he hid in the woods , if possible , like some shy creature of the forest . Finding a comfortable place under a tree and ignoring his wife 's calls , he would lie drowsing and watching until the visitor went away , after which he would reappear casually around the corner of the barn , dragging some object to indicate that he had been busy in a remote part of the property . Gradually the inhabitants of Highfield and its vicinity began to emerge as individuals . There were not too many of them and all were gregarious , with the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bridge evenings.  | " Good Lord , " said Mrs. Crombie . " New York was a lonely wilderness compared to this place . " " What bothers me is how we 're ever going to pay back all these people , " said Mrs. Crombie . " I 'm sure of one thing and that is I 'm not going to put on a dinner party and cook it myself . We 've ruined ourselves enough already by building this porch . " " There must be somebody that will come in and cook . " " I 'm going to find out , " she said , " and if there is n't we 'd better put the house on the market . " Several days passed , then as they sat resting for a moment on Mr. Salvatore 's stone platform , like actors in a tableau , Mrs. Crombie brought up the subject again . " There are two cooks , " she said . " Two . In the whole village . One is Mrs. Frankenthal and the other is Mrs. Peabody . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and then the other . It 's like two clubs . Mrs. Frankenthal heads one club and Mrs. Peabody the other , and if you choose one and she is n't available you do n't go poaching in the other gang 's territory . " " Sounds like the makings of a good rumble , " said Mr. Crombie . " Which gang are you joining ? " " There 's no question of that , " she said . " Miss Partridge decided it for us . She called Mrs. Frankenthal to tell her that we were regular . " " Then we do n't have to have letters of recommendation ? " " Not with Miss Partridge around . Now I think we ought to build a dinner around the Morris Clements . They 're awfully nice and they 've asked us for dinner twice . I 'll try and work it for next week . " " Better nail down Mrs. Whosis first , " he advised . " Oh , I will . Do n't worry . "  |p186THE  FOLLOWING DAY AFTER Amorning spent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house for lunch . He had postponed his regular morning schedule until this major chore was done . The clearing out of this relatively unimportant area had become an obsession with him . It was like a gladiatorial contestin which one or the other contestant must perish and it sometimes seemed to him that the cards had been stacked before the show started . As he whacked away at the brambles , the sweat running into his eyes , his muscles aching from the unaccustomed demands being made upon them , his heart pounding , he envisaged the day when his body would be discovered lying face down in a clump of poison ivy . " Mr. Graham Crombie of Sunset Hill , Highfield , who has been missing from his home for several days , was found this morning in his wood lot ( that was better than behind the barn ' ) , where he had been workingwhen he was overcome . . . . " He swung his Sears Roebuck machete savagely at the base of a clump of brambles . " Mr. Crombie was a latecomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respect of the entire community . . . . " He heard the sound of organ music and a great sadness welled up within him as he struck another blow with the machete . Now , as he approached the house , the vision of an ice-coldp187martini drove all other thoughts from his mind . He realized that it had been playing around in the back of his consciousnessfor the last half hour . He 'd better watch out . When retired men began to hit the stuff they were apt to act like South Sea characters in a Conrad novel . What bunk ! He used to take a drink before lunch when he was in business without all this flimflam . Ah , but then he was entertaining some customer . All right . Now he was entertaining Jinny and if it put him to sleep most of the afternoon he could n't think of a more delightful prospect . Was n't he a free man ? His step quickened . He went to the little portable bar that had been set up in the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to start making those things regularly in the middle of the day ! " That was one of the troubles with being retired . In the old days he had been his own master from the time he left the house in the morning until he came home at night . " I 'm exhausted , " he said . " You 'll be more exhausted after a couple of those . " " Good , " he said . " Then I take it you 're not going to join me . " Oh , I do n't care  --  I suppose if you 're going to have one " Do n't have one to please me , " he said . " This stuff is white gold . " Why was it that so many women acted as if they were doing you a favor by drinking sixty cents ' worth of your liquor ? They sat on either side of the kitchen table . " Wait till I tell you about our dinner party , " she said . " I called Mrs. Frankenthal first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take some kind of a day job in one of those little modernistic factories down in the valley . She was booked up this Saturday and the next , but she 'd be glad to come the Saturday after that , if you please . So I nailed her down and called Mary Clement.  | " Now here 's where the story begins to get good . Mary said  --  get this  --  Mary said she could n't be sorrier , but she 'd just engaged Mrs. Peabody to cook for her on that night on account of some people coming from New York for the weekend . " So I got her to save the next Saturday . Then I called back ' Mrs. Frankenthal and believe it or not she was free . So 1 called Mary back and clinched the deal and then I got those attractive Bakers who have been so nice to us , and Miss Partridge , and that deaf old Mr. Fogarty . He likes to play bridge because when people sit around and talk he does n't know what they 're saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight people three weeks from Saturday . " Mr. Crombie looked distressed . " I thought things would be simpler in the country . You know  --  I thought we 'd be able to call people around five in the afternoon and say Why do n't you drop over and have a bite with us ? ' That 's the way I 'd like to live . " " Well , it is n't the way I want to , " said Mrs. Crombie . " Not when I have to do the cooking . " THE INTERVENING WEEKS PASSEDquickly . " Good Lord , " exclaimed Mrs. Crombie . " I completely forgot we have that doggone dinner party coming up on Saturday.  | " Who 's coming ? " asked Mr. Crombie . " I 'll have to look it up . " " Better phone them . They 've probably forgotten by now . " " Or they might have the year wrong , " she said . On the Saturday morning of the dinner , the phone rang while they were at breakfast . It was Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , but Morris and I are both in bed with some kind of a flu virus . We 're just able to crawl around enough to keep from starving , but we could n't possibly go out tonight . No , dear , there is n't a chance . If you could see us you would n't want us . " There were tears in Mrs. Crombie 's voice as she replaced the receiver . " There goes my party , " she said . " We gave it for the Clements . " " Get somebody else , " said Mr. Crombie reassuringly . " You can get somebody else . " She shook her head dubiously . " I 'll try , " she said , " but at this late hour . . . " It was a rainy , raw day . He spent the morning in his library catching up on his mail . At eleven o'clock Mrs. Crombie appeared , in obvious distress . " Old Mr. Fogarty was going up the front steps of his house this morning and they came away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ankle . " " How do you do a thing like that ? " he asked . " He must be a retired acrobat . " " I could n't care less . All I know is the old mummy ca n't come for dinner tonight . The only people I could get to fill in for the Clements were the Penlocks . They 're terrible and we certainly owe them nothing , but if you 're going to give a party you have to have guests . " " Never heard of them . " " Oh , yes you have  --  we 've met them half a dozen times . Now we 're only going to have one table of bridge and you canp190talk to the Penlocks . They play so badly you ought to be glad . " An hour later the Bakers fell out . The virus was spreading . But the accommodating Penlocks immediately came through with two unexpected house guests . " It would be much easier , " said Mr. Crombie that night after they had poured out the Penlocks and their house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , paid Mrs. Frankenthal and locked the house for the night , " if , in the country , where the simplest things are complicated , we could send a check to people whom we owe for hospitality instead of paying them in kind . " " It would be even easier , " said Mrs. Crombie , cryptically , " if the country was filled with country people and the city with city people and never the twain . . . never , never , never . IT SOMETIMES SEEMED TO MR . Crombie that retirement was like getting married all over again . Both parties were forced to make as many adjustments as a bride and groom . Ever since their marriage , for example , Mr. Crombie had been leaving the house at eight-thirty each morning and returning some time before dinner . During the intervening nine or ten hours he and Jinny lived in separate worlds . Of course , they discussed happenings of mutual inter/est when they came together in the evening , but their daylight hours were nonetheless independent because of that . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that neither of them had ever thought much about it . It was taken for granted that a businessman should spend approximatelynine hours a day away from home . In addition to that , both parties to the marriage contract normally devoted another eight or nine hours to the business of sleeping , includinggoing to bed and getting up . They were thus left approximately six hours of each day for connubial bliss of what might be called the more routine sort . When one looked at it that way and realized that marriage only affected about twenty-five per cent of one 's life , it was hard to understand why people had so much difficulty with it . Both he and Jinny had welcomed the opportunity which retirement afforded them to spend more time together , but they were soon aware of the fact that just because of this , each one had lost something that they had valued more highly than they realized . Jinny had never asked him to account for his time away from home . If he did n't get back to the apartment until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He , in turn , never asked her where she had been . It was a mutual , tacit agreementbetween them , a warranty of freedom , and it had worked for forty-two years . During his courting days she had been one of the most popular girls in Cleveland . Even after he had won the long , competitive race he had gone through agonies of doubt when she was out of his sight . Try as he would , he could not help questioning her anxiously as to where she had been and with whom  --  above all , with whom  --  until one day she put her arms around his neck and said , " Darling , you ought to know by this time that I love you . If you do n't , you 're dumber than I think . But do n't ever try to build fences around me and I'llp192never build them around you . If I have to hold someone with fences , I do n't want them and I do n't believe you do , either . " They had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , to be away all day , engrossed in the scrambled activities of an active business life . Under those circumstances what one did in the late hours of the afternoon became no more important than what one did during the late hours of the morning . It would be an entirely different matter for a retired man to hang around the house all day and then suddenly disappear around five o'clock on an unexplained errand . There was no occasion for such eccentric actions in a town like Highfield , but it irked him to realize that had there been he would be obliged to account for it . Although she never intimated it , Mrs. Crombie also missed the days when her dearly-beloved cleared out at eight-thirty each morning and she was free to chart her own course for the rest of the day without comment or criticism  --  days when she could go to the hairdresser without having to explain why it was necessary , why it took so long , or to listen to a satirical discourse on the amount of money which her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out of pigtails . " Why in the world you girls insist on calling them ' permanents ' when they have to be done every few weeks is more than I can figure . And why ca n't women wash their own hair . I do . It 's just a matter of standing under the shower and rubbingsoap on it . " And when she came back from the supermarket and he helped her carry in the huge paper bags , he always looked for the cash-register slips . " Good God ! Twenty dollars and eightyfivecents ! What are we having , a banquet ? I could take you to the top restaurant in New York for that . " " Darling , if you 'd only let me run my department and youp193run yours . This is n't tonight 's dinner  --  these are staples that we have to have in the house . " " Do we have to have frozen brownies ? " He was unloading the bags . " How do we know these people are n't overcharging us ? Do you ever go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She made a despairing gesture with her hands . " No , I do n't go around to other stores checking prices . These people are not cheating us . After buying food all these years I think you might at least give me credit for knowing when I 'm being overcharged . And do n't tell me again that if you ran your businessthis way it would have gone broke long ago . " There was n't any question about it . She missed her old freedoms ; the ability to have lunch with a friend and talk girl talk ; the fast snack out of the refrigerator when lunch was merely nourishment instead of a meal ; the afternoons spent wandering around Bergdorf 's , Saks , Bloomingdale 's and the little side-street shops , just keeping in touch with things ; the silly hysterical afternoon bridge games at Susie Allen 's , the matinees , the casual five-o'clock drop-ins on friends where you would always find amusing people . She missed these things . There was another side to the coin , however . Gradually , Mr. Crombie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run a house . As he watched Mrs. Crombie handle the countless minute details involved in keeping two people alive under modern conditions  --  the little daily stints of laundering , the never-ending round of bed-making , room-straightening , food preparation and the disposal of its messy aftermath , the tendingof plants , the interminable letters  --  his admiration for her ability mounted each day . Jinny 's life was devoted to keeping dozens of little things going at the same time . He remembered an act that he had seen once at Radio City Music Hall in which a young manp194started two dozen dishes spinning on the tops of wobbly sticks lined up on a long table . As each dish slowed down and threatened to fall , he managed to reach it just in time to set it spinning again by rotating the sticks . That was Jinny 's day  --  rushing from one plate to another , setting each in motion before it fell , then on to the next . As a background to it all were the interruptions to which she seemed to be constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the ones with which he was familiar at least had some slight relation to the business in which he was engaged . Jinny 's interruptions were related to nothing . A young man from the Fuller Brush Company ; a fresh-faced youth selling combined magazine subscriptions ; a neighbor , choosing a moment when Jinny was up to her elbows in suds to pay a formal call ; the amazing regularity with which her time-saving gadgets , the dishwasher , the vacuum cleaner , the washing machine , broke down and the hours she spent trying to persuade the repairman to come and set them in motion again . Frequently he was pulled into these crises . " Gray , dear , the car is making the most horrible noise . It goes wheek , wheek ' every time I let in the clutch and it almost stopped , coming up from the village . Wo n't you take it to Robbins Garage and find out what 's the matter ? We ca n't get stuck without any car . This is the night we 're going over to Smithtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a second car if we 're going to live in the country . " Or , again , " I hate to keep interrupting you , but I have n't had a chance to do the marketing and now Mabel Harris is coming over to talk about the Community Chest and , knowingMabel , the stores will all be closed before she gets through . Would you be a darling and slip down to the A &; P and get the things on this list because we have n't anything to eat in the house . "  | " Dearest , the most terrible thing  --  I was letting the water out of the basin upstairs and all of a sudden a foul jet came jumping out of the drain hole and hit me right in the face . I called the plumber and he said it was the tile field which has been in for about fifty years . Only , the trouble is the man who put in the tile field is dead and nobody seems to know where it is , so wo n't you talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend and we certainly do n't want dirty water squirting in their faces . " As he lounged around Robbins Garage waiting for the car to be fixed , or stood patiently in line with his wire baby carriagewaiting for a woman who had apparently bought food supplies for a polar expedition , or held long , technical discussionswith the plumber , quite certain that neither one of them knew what he was talking about , but that it was sure to cost a lot  --  as he watched whole days get rubbed out standing around , waiting around , rushing around on futile errands , he occasionally wondered what would have happened if retirementhad n't occurred just when it did and released him for this kind of duty . Had he been obliged to go to the office , who would have done all these things ? But he did n't have to go to the office so it was a rhetorical question . But what did men do who lived in the country and had to go to work each day ?  |p196IT  WAS SUNDAY NIGHT . THEY HADjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the name of that odd creature with the beard ? " asked Mrs. Crombie . " Did n't you know ? That was Professor Turner from the college . He teaches philosophy . Somebody told me he was quite a scholar . Written a lot of books and all that sort of thing . He asked us to drop in the next time we 're over in Middleburg . " " Well , you can have him . I thought he was a terrible bore . All he talked to me about was what dreadful people his associateswere . " Mr. Crombie looked disappointed . " It might be an opening into that college crowd , " he said . " I 've always thought it would be stimulating to get to know them . " " If Professor Turner 's a sample . . . well , we 're not going over tonight and I 'm going to get some sleep . If we 're driving to New York tomorrow I 've got a bad day ahead of me . I wish to goodness we could stay put for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So do I , " he agreed . " Here we are at the end of three months and I have n't even started to set up my workshop in the cellar . Outside , the whole place still looks like an abandonedduck farm . I was going to do a lot of reading and Ip197have n't cracked a book . I was going to do so many things . Where does the time go ? " There was a trace of hysteria in his voice . " I do n't know , dear , " she said soothingly , as to a small child who shows signs of a tantrum . " But you must remember that we 've been through a whale of an adjustment . Four months ago you were living in a push-button world with a slave of a secretary and a highly organized office to back her up . Then you suddenly find yourself in a little country town where you have to do everything yourself . You 're still groping for the push buttons and they just are n't there any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said impatiently . " I want to do things myself . I also want to get my days under control . " " Why do n't you then ? " she asked impatiently . " It may make you happier . " " I intend to , " he said . " From now on I 'm going to spend the morning in my library . I do n't want any interruptions . Just pretend I 'm not here . If people phone , take the message . If they call , you attend to them . If the house catches fire , work it out with the Fire Department . " He looked at her fiercely as if anticipating opposition , but she said nothing . HE FINISIIED HIS BREAKFASTquickly , scarcely bothering to look at the Times . " Good-by , " he said , rising from the table . " See you at lunch . " The sun was shining through the windows of his littlep198library . From somewhere down in the valley came the distant whine of a power saw . A catbird called from the apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the way to start a day ; everything in hand , incisive . The first thing was to get the paper work out of the way . A pile of envelopes , most of them unopened , lay at the end of his table-desk . Probably bills . Those were bad enough , but not half as bad as the letters requiring answers . He hated writinglonghand letters . It took him forever and nobody could read his handwriting . After dictating for thirty or forty years a man forgot how to write . How in the world did men like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson carry on a massive correspondence with an old goose quill ? And most of it just to exchange ideas ! He picked off the top envelope from the pile and ripped it open . It was from George Caulkins of the National Borum Company , enclosing a speech which he had made before some captive audience in Indianapolis . " The Death of Free Enterprise  --  aMurder , but No Mystery . " George loved titles like that and he always thought the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George had written , " I am enclosing a copy of a little talk I gave to the Watrous Society in Indianapolisa few nights ago . I thought you might be interested . Unlesswe want the Democrats to eliminate free enterprise in " Do let me know what you think of my little effort . " In the old days when George 's company had been one of his best customers Mr. Crombie would have dropped the speech into the wastebasket and written a long , laudatory letter . Now he dropped the letter in the basket and placed the speech on a pile of similar documents to be read at some future time . Being retired , he supposed it was important to keep up with these things . His eye wandered through the open window to the platthiscountry , we must all put our shoulder to the wheel.  |p199form  of the unfinished porch . At the point where it joined the house he noticed a pile of rubble obviously left there by Mr. Salvatore . Did that wop think that he , Mr. Crombie , was goingto clear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry note on his scratch pad : " Crumb re mess . " The next few envelopes contained bills which he piled togetherneatly for future attention . Then there was a letter from Frank Babbitt . Frank had proposed somebody for the Club by the name of Otto Jenkins or Jensen . Why did n't people write so you could read their letters . Would Mr. Crombiewrite a letter in Jenkins ' /Jensen 's behalf ? He could n't remember anyone by either of those names . Better let that one simmer . He placed it on a third pile which represented " MattersPending . " The next one was from Gleason . He hoped that everything was going well and wanted Mr. Crombie to know how much everyone missed him . When Mr. Crombie was settled in his new house , which Mr. Gleason had heard was charming ( heard from whom ? ) , they hoped to see him more often around the office ( damned lie ) . In the meanwhile , there was a wild Irishman by the name of O'Kelley who was giving everyone a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small indeed  --  and he was alwaysasking for special favors and hanging around bothering people . They knew that he was a friend of Mr. Crombie 's , but he had become such a nuisance that everyone felt he should be told to take his business elsewhere and they had about decided to do this . Of course , if Mr. Crombie felt otherwise . . . He laid the letter on the table and looked out across the valley . O'Kelley had been a legacy . During the war he had done something for Joe Loomis ' son  --  saved his life somehow or other . When O'Kelley inherited a little money , Joe had asked Mr. Crombie , as a special favor , to take on the job ofp200handling it for him . You were always getting things like that thrown at you in the investment-counsel business . The man had been a headache , just as Gleason said , but over the years he had grown to like the bouncy little Irishman . Once he was cast adrift he 'd lose his money in a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that . Deep in thought , he turned instinctively to dictate a reply to Miss Parkinson , but there was no Miss Parkinson waiting with her notebook on her knee . An oppressive feeling of not belonging swept over him . He seemed to be sitting in somebody else 's paneled room looking out through somebody else 's window on a strange and alien world . He would be in town tomorrow . After his directors ' meetinghe would drop in and see Gleason . At the same time he could get Miss Parkinson to find out who this fellow Jenkins or Jensen was ? More bills . If they did n't stop spending money they were going broke . Here was a letter from Henry Lee inviting him for dinner at the Club to say good-by to Fletcher Sands . Fletcher was leaving soon to take up his new job as Ambassadorto Spain . That would be a good dinner . He knew just who would be there . But it was on a Friday night . He 'd have to write Henry immediately and explain to him that although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country on either Wednesday or Thursday night . They might make an exception , of course . What was the difference , when you stopped to think of it , whether they were in the country or the city ? He 'd speak to Jinny . Certainly he could n't answer this now . He placed it on top of " Matters Pending . " He was bored . His eye wandered to his bookcases and noted that Europe since 1815 was upside down . He got up and set it on its feet . Some day he wanted to read it again . Next to it stood The Journals of Lewis and Clark . He had asked for it for Christmas several years ago and never read it . He won/o1dered how many of these books , that he claimed to love so much , were still unread . He began making a test count on the left-hand section . The door opened and Mrs. Crombie stuck her head in , timidly . " I hate to do this to you , darling , but I really do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peterborough . He 's got some banker with him who thinks he knows you . They insist on seeing you just to say hello . " " Why did n't you tell them I was out ? " " I did and they laughed at me and said they saw you through the window as they turned in the drive . " Mr. Crombie groaned dramatically . " The Admiral is showing his friend around the outside of the place , " she said . " Maybe if you can keep them outdoors you can get rid of them quicker . " Half an hour later , having pushed the Admiral and his friend into the latter 's decrepit sedan , he resumed his seat in the library . There were only a few more envelopes , all containingbills , which he placed with the others . Well , that took care of the paper work . Now for an hour or so of reading ; something worthwhile , something with meat on it . He got up and walked over to the bookshelves . How about the Lewis and Clark Journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Let 's see what else . . . From the cellar beneath his feet there came the sound of pounding . The ancient windows rattled with each blow . For heaven 's sake what was going on now ? One might just as well try to read in the Grand Central Station . He went in search of Mrs. Crombie , but she was nowhere around and her car was gone . In its place stood Mr. Le Bleu 's Cadillac . Mr. Crombie descended the cellar stairs with a sinking heart . Mr. Le Bleu had removed the metal casing of the furnace and clamped a huge Stillson wrench to some gadget near the top . He was pounding the handle of the wrench with a ham/mer . " Break the son of a bitch if I have to , " he cried as Mr. Crombie appeared in the circle of light cast by the hanging bulb . " Bust it . To hell with it . " " What 's the matter now ? " yelled Mr. Crombie . " Condenser . Wanta take it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too small . No good to begin with . Rusted out . Kaput . " He renewed his attack on the handle of the Stillson . There was a sharp crack and Mr. Le Bleu almost fell into Mr. Crombie 's arms . " Broke off , " he shouted , triumphantly , holding up a jagged piece of metal for Mr. Crombie 's inspection . " Flaw . Bum metal . Pfui . Have to drill the rest out . Take time . No hot water till I get her fixed . Do n't need it this weather . Good thing we got at it before it turned cold . Lucky . " Mr. Crombie followed him dispiritedly up the stairs . " But I do n't understand , " he said , " the furnace is perfectly all right . Then you come in and break it and walk out . " " Break nothing , " shouted Mr. Le Bleu . " Rotten metal . Furnace'sno good . Never was . Wo n't heat house . Tell you what  --  instead of fooling with it I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating . Copper pipes . Back to-morrow . " He was out of the house and into the Cadillac before Mr. Crombie could collect himself . " Get the hell out of here , " he yelled as Mr. Le Bleu swung the car onto the road . " I never want to see you on the place again . " Mr. Le Bleu nodded through the open window and disappeared in the direction of the village . He phoned Barnhauser . " I fired that damn plumber you sent me . He 's nuts . " " Nuts ? " said Br . Barnhauser , thoughtfully , as if weighing the matter . " Sorry to hear that . " " Not as sorry as I am . He comes in here , breaks my furnace and walks out . Now what are we going to do ? "  | " Yes , what are we going to do ? " agreed Mr. Barnhauser in a tone which placed the whole responsibility on Mr. Crombie . " You see , the only good man in town is Henry Hopkins and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where anythingis on that place of yours , neither . " " What good does it do me to have someone who knows where things are if all he does is break them ? " Mr. Barnhauser made a clucking noise . " I 'll drop down to the school an ' see if I can persuade Henry to come over an ' take a look . He 's a good man . Awful busy , though . " Mr. Crombie went back to his library and sat at his table , idly drumming his fingers on its surface and staring out the window . He heard Mrs. Crombie return . She must n't find him doing nothing . Better get at some reading . His nerves were too frayed for anything heavy . The world 's great books could come later . He picked out a murder mystery that he had bought to read on a plane and then had slept all the way instead . The Case of the Unknown Blonde ; that might be just right for today . Turning on the standing light beside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mrs. Crombie , opening the door . His morning in the library was over . " Get a lot accomplished ? " she asked cheerily as they munched their sandwiches in the living room . " I 'm almost nuts , " he said . " What 's the matter , dear ? " " I fired the plumber . " " Mr. Le Bleu ? " she asked , incredulously . " But , Gray . What are we going to do ? He 's here all the time . He 's sort of a plumber-in-residence . " " Not any more , he is n't . He came in this morning , broke off the top of the furnace so we could n't get any hot water , then said he 'd get me an estimate on a new furnace and I threw him out . "  |p204She  looked at him admiringly . " Oh , Gray , why did you do it while I was away and could n't see it ? But what in the world are we going to do without any hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Crombie vaguely . " Well , we go to New York this afternoon , so it does n't really matter , " she said cheerfully . THE FOLLOWING DAY HE MADE HISfirst visit to the office since he had walked out of it , a retired man , three months before . As he entered the familiar elevator he felt as apprehensive as a debutante . The elevator door closed itself behind him with the firm efficiency of a door that tolerates no nonsense . " Floors , please , " said the operator . " Twelve , " said Mr. Crombie . He was under the impression that the other people in the elevator were looking at him curiously . The operator pushed a number of buttons , then , relaxing against the side of the cab , he began to hum while he examined his passengers coldly as if they had been a collection of window dummies . The elevator came to a stop , adjusting itself nervously to the floor level . One had the feeling that it was irritated at something and would speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the operator , interrupting his humming . Mr. Crombie did not move . " Twelve out . Washstep , " said the operator , sharply.  | " Oh , " said Mr. Crombie , as one awakening from a nap . He was in the hall , standing outside the double doors of Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner . Through the glass he could see old Penrose , the receptionist , bending over his desk , sorting cards as usual . He pushed open one of the doors and entered . Old Penrose looked up , then , recognizing Mr. Crombie , he sprang to his feet and hurried around the desk . " Mr. Crombie , sir . " Seizing Mr. Crombie 's hand in both of his he wrung it warmly . This is a great pleasure , sir . We 've all missed you terribly . I suppose you 'll want to see Mr. Gleason . He has somebody with him , but I 'll let him know . How have you been , sir ? You 're looking well . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . You 're looking pretty fit yourself , Penrose . Do n't interrupt Gleason if he 's busy . Is Miss Parkinson tied up ? " " I 'll see , sir . She was with Mr. Gleason a few minutes ago . " Mr. Crombie sat down in one of the overstuffed leather chairs which flanked the round oak table in the reception room . How many times had he come out from his office to rescue customers from the depths of these chairs ? Business Week and Fortune were still in their accustomed places on the table but The New Yorker was missing . It would be just like Gleason to have had The New Yorker removed . In a few minutes he heard a delighted little cry behind him . " Mr. Crombie . I 'm so glad . . . . " He thought Miss Parkinson looked somewhat older , but after a certain age everybody looked somewhat older every time you saw them . He wondered if he looked somewhat older to Miss Parkinson . " Come , " she said . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gleason 's through with his caller . He knows you 're here . " She led the way as though he were a stranger . He sat down beside her typewriter desk . The door to his old office was shut . It made him feel vaguely uncomfortable.  | " Who 's with him ? " " I do n't think you 'd know her . She 's a new client and as rich as an Arab sheik . But now tell me about yourself . How have you been ? How is Mrs. Crombie ? " Mr. Crombie told her . " And you like the country ? " " Crazy about it , " said Mr. Crombie . There was a momentarysilence . " Any changes around the office ? " he asked . She made a face . " Oh , it 's not the same place without you , Mr. Crombie . Everybody hates it . Everything is run by committeesnow . Nobody can get any work done . They 're always at some committee meeting . Some say it 's because Mr. Gleasonca n't decide anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't believe very much in office rules , but he can dream up a new one every few hours . " " What kind of rules ? " " Well , do you know that secretaries ca n't smoke any more except in the washrooms ? That almost caused a palace revolution . And then there are no more coffee breaks . No more coffee breaks , mind you ! And Old Penrose keeps a time card showing when everyone gets in in the morning and when they go home at night and how long they take for lunch . For lunch ! How do you like that ? " Mr. Crombie was careful not to indicate , by the twitch of a facial muscle , how he liked it . " There 've been a lot of changes in the departments , too . The chart group and the economists have been put together in a new department . Tom Potter is in charge of it . " " You mean they put Tom Potter over Myron Crawford ? " She nodded . " We all feel so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of him . " " But Tom Potter is n't an economist  --  he 's an account executiveand a damned good one . " She shrugged her shoulders . " I know , " she said . " Then they put all new business under young Partridge . He 's supposedp207to co-ordinate it , or something . That broke Mr. Applegate 's heart . Oh , there 's been plenty of blood spilt . " " Any changes on the staff ? " " No . Just the usual come and go . You know , of course , that Mr. Buckley is due to retire in December . " The news gave him an unexpected glow of pleasure . So they were going to jettison Buckley , who thought he was so invaluable . He was one of the best technical men in the shop . One by one they 'd all be dropped over the side and he hoped they 'd like it . " Buckley 's a good man , " he said . " He 'll be hard to replace . She fingered the keys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what 's going to happen . I go out myselfnext year . " " You do , do n't you ? I 'd forgotten that . " You insisted on having women retire at sixty . Why , I could never understand , but there it is and out I go . " There was an uncomfortable silence . " They threw poor old O'Kelley out , " she said . " They wrote me that they were thinking about it . " ( So they had acted without waiting for his opinion . ) " I felt sorry for the old fellow . He was pathetic when he came out of Gleason 's  --  Mr. Gleason 's  --  office . This was sort of his home . " " How about you ? " he asked . " Are you getting along all right ? " " Oh , I get along , " she said . " I know how to handle that situation . You know me on office politics . Never open your mouth except to eat and drink . " The inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gleason . " Oh , Graham . I 'm so glad that you 're here . I want you to meet Mrs. Pauling . This is Mr. Crombie , Mrs. Pauling  --  the person I was just telling you about . " " Who ? " asked Mrs. Pauling.  | " Mr. Graham Crombie  --  the founder of Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner . " " Oh ? " said Mrs. Pauling . Having thus taken care of the amenities , she turned back to Mr. Gleason . " I 'll expect to hear from you , then , by the end of the week . " Nodding vaguely in the direction of Mr. Crombie , she hurried out . " Well , Graham , " said Mr. Gleason heartily , " come in . Come into your own office . " He put his arm around Mr. Crombie 's shoulders . " Same office . Nothing changed . Same pictures on the walls . Same furniture . We want to keep things the way you left them , Graham . " Mr. Crombie sat down in the visitor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled an odd chair over from the corner and sat down beside him . They chatted about various members of the staff , about Mr. Crombie 's new life , about the market . As Mr. Crombie recalled the conversationlater , there was much talk , but they really did n't say any thing . Quite evidently Gleason had no problems requiring any advice from Mr. Crombie . Nor was he going to open him self up to gratuitous suggestions . He glanced at his wrist watch . " Graham , I could n't be more apologetic , but I have a meet ing at eleven-thirty and I 'm late now . Look here . All the boys will want to see you . Why do n't you sit here at my  --  your desk and Miss Parkinson will get them in as you want them .... " " No , no , Joe . I would n't feel comfortable doing that . This is your desk now . No , you run along to your meeting . I 'll just wander around and say hello ' to the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassed instructions to Miss Parkinson , scuttled off in the direction of the elevators . Mr. Crombiestarted down the long corridor past the row of private offices , each with its secretary standing guard at the door ;  |p209everything  was precisely aligned , sterile , not a displaced paper clip to mark the fact that this was where two hundred human beings spent a large part of their lives . Myron Crawford was in his office , but he had a visitor . He saw Mr. Crombie and , excusing himself , hurried out to greet him . " Graham , it 's grand to see you . We 've all missed you so . I 'm awfully sorry I 'm tied up . Are you going to be around long ? I want to chat with you . " " No , " he said , " I 'm on my way , but I 'll be popping in from time to time . How are things going ? " Then he remembered what Miss Parkinson had told him and wished he had not asked the question . " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we miss you , Graham . Well , if you 're not around when I finish with this gentleman , do n't forget to stop in and see me the next time you 're in the office . " He lowered his voice , conspiratorially . " This man at my desk is from Texas and I do n't like to keep these oil tycoons waiting . " They both laughed as if this was very funny and Myron Crawford went back to his Texan . The next office was empty . Then came Bill Buckley , who was on the phone as usual . He had a secretary that Mr. Crombie had never seen before . " Will Mr. Buckley be long ? " he asked . " I 'm afraid so , " she said . " He 's been on that call for fifteen minutes already and he sounds as if he were going to go on for quite a while . " Mr. Crombie nodded . " I wo n't wait , " he said . " Who shall I say called , sir ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He moved on . Tom Potter was out . Partridge was out . Tom Bingham was working in a confusion of pamphlets and statistical charts scattered all over his huge oak desk . While Mr. Crombiep210stood hesitating in the doorway , Tom looked up and his face split into a wide grin . " Graham , you old walrus , where in the world have you been hiding all these weeks ? We were going to send out the Saint Bernards . Come in . Sit down . I could n't be more delighted . " He had always liked Tom Bingham . There was nothing complex about him , although he had one of the best brains in the office . His words carried no double meanings . For the first time that morning Mr. Crombie felt at home as he sat beside Bingham 's desk and listened to his booming voice . Tom did n't give a hang about office politics . He had no operational ambitions . He lived in a slide-rule world ; a world of decimal points and book values and times earnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves . " Well , what 's been going on ? " asked Mr. Crombie . He wished he could start a conversation on some other note than " How 's business ? " but it seemed to be the one common denominator , the sole rope that still bound him to these men with whom he had worked for so many years , but who would be strangers the moment the rope was cast off . " Oh , nothing special , " said Bingham . " What we lose on the bananas we make on the oranges . Let 's see  --  you were still here when we brought in the Snowden business , were n't you ? " " Never heard of it , " said Mr. Crombie . " Really , Graham ? I ca n't believe it . That was an interestingshow . California group . One of the hardest nuts we ever had to crack  --  and the biggest . But we cracked it and it 's in . It 's made us God 's gift to the transcontinental airlines , though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce us . " He gave Mr. Crombie a quick summary of the Snowden picture , but Mr. Crombie was an inattentive listener . For thirty-five years he had prided himself on knowing every detailof the business  --  on following every thread of its complexp211texture . Now , a few weeks after his retirement , he had lost touch so completely that he did n't even know about its peaks . This was a good example of the value of retired men as consultants . Bingham was cordial and relaxed as always . Anyone could see , however , that he was up to his neck in work . Mr. Crombiesuddenly remembered the retirement bums who used to plant themselves in the chair beside his desk just when he was working against a deadline . They were so sure you were glad to see them that you could n't bear to hurt them , but they never seemed to sense when a man was busy . He rose quickly as Bingham finished , and when the latter protested , he mumbledsomething about a luncheon engagement . As he wandered aimlessly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl came out of Mr. Applegate 's office carrying a sheaf of papers . She was an exceptionally attractive girl  --  not a girl at all , really , but a woman in her early forties . For a moment he could not place her . Then he remembered  --  she was the one in Statistics ; the one who had done such brilliant work that she had been made head of the department just beforehe left . For the life of him he could not remember her name , but that was nothing strange ; he could n't remember anyone 's name these days . She saw him and hurried toward him . " Mr. Crombie , " she said , " how wonderful ! We 've missed you so . We really have . " Everyone had told him how they had missed him , but this young woman , whose name he could n't recall , was the only one that carried conviction in her voice . " You look so well , " she was saying , " as if you 'd been living out of doors all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What more responsive chord could she have touched in a man of sixty-five ? Mr. Crombie unconsciously sucked in his stomach and drew up his chest . A most attractive , blondehairedgirl with laughter lines in the corners of her eyes  --   |p212what  was her name ? She had a particularly lovely , deep voice ; a voice as confident as her level blue eyes , which seemed to be probing you while she talked . How odd that he had never really noticed her before. " ... ten years younger I 'd say , at the least . Why is it that when people retire they immediately start looking younger ? That would make a nice statistical study someday when we have nothing to do . But tell me . Where do you live and what do you do , now that you 're on your own ? " " Well , " he said , " we live near a funny little village called Highfield in a nice old house that was built in 1790 and looks out across a valley to a range of mountains . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded with pleasant things , " she said . " You can tell the empty-day ones the minute they come into the office . " She leaned casually against a table littered with SEC reports , as if inviting the conversation to continue . What in the world was a girl like this doing in Statistics ? " I 've never been so busy in my life , " he said . " But I do n't exactly know what at . I seem to be so tangled up with things that I do n't have time to really do anything . " She smiled . " Page Miss Parkinson , " she said . " It must be awful to work with someone as efficient as Miss P. and then suddenly find yourself all alone in the boat and on a strange ocean at that . " She straightened up and glanced at the papers in her hand . " Well , it certainly has been nice to see you and I 'm sure that as you get more used to the country you 'll find the time that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . He did n't want to break off the conversation . " What are you doing for lunch ? " It was an impulsive and stupid question , and he regretted it before the words were out of his mouth . She looked startled and drew away slightly . What did shep213think he was going to do ? Grab her ? Then , noting his embarrassment , she grinned . " Why , nothing , " she said , " I was going out for a sandwich . " Well , he was in for it and it was nobody 's fault but his own . " Will you have lunch with me ? " " Why . . . why . . . I 'd like to . . . very much . " Why in the world had he done it ? Why had he put himself in such a ridiculous position ? What would the people in the office say if they saw him walking out with . . . with .. . with whom ? Would n't Gleason love it ? He 'd probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't even know if she was married . He tried to get a glimpse of her left hand . She saw his eyes searching and held out the hand , smiling . " Yes , " she said . " Once . It did n't take . I 'm one of those dangerous divorcees . Still want to take me to lunch ? " " Naturally , " he said . He was conscious of the pleasant sense of not too imminent danger that grass widows always gave him . He took her to " 21 . " No one ever bothered his head about the person you were with at " 21 " unless , of course , it happened to be a celebrity or you were one yourself . The only person who saw them leave the office was Old Penrose and after all there was nothing unusual about two people leaving a big office and going down in a public elevator at the same time . The downstairs dining room at " 21 " was full . He was glad . It was crowded and noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banquette table . " Why do n't we have a pair of martinis ? " he asked as an assistant maitre d'hotel came up , pencil poised over pad . " They 're good here . " She raised a hand in protest . " In the middle of the day ? Do you think so ? Oh , well , here goes one brilliant career in Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner . Make mine a Gibson . If I 'm going to blow gin at them , I might as well lace it with onions . "  | " Two Gibsons , " he said . They sipped the drinks and made small talk . " Why did you ask me to do this ? " she asked suddenly . He studied his glass , turning its stem slowly between his thumb and forefinger . " I do n't know , " he said . " Quite frankly I do n't know . " " Would you be relieved if I just tossed this off and reeled back to Statistics ? " " I think I asked you because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that you were truly glad to see me back . The only one that I was n't interrupting . " " Nonsense , " she said . " They were all glad to see you . PerhapsI was the only one who was n't busy . " " That 's what I mean . I do n't suppose a retired man has any right to go prowling around an office where everything is moving in high . I remember how mad I used to get at the deskparkers  --  theones who just came in to say hello . ' What is this American craving to say hello ' ? And why do retired people want to come back ? Is it a **30;3214;TOOLONG ' complex , or what ? " " Could it be they 're looking for something they 've mislaid ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " I mean something they 've left behind and they do n't know what it is . " " The whole thing is beginning to sound like Peter Pan , " he said . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand that sort of thing better than most of them . " " Who told you that ? " " Miss Parkinson . " " Do you know Miss Parkinson well ? " That was a stupid lead . She laughed . " Do n't worry . I wo n't tell her you take girls to 21 ' whose names you do n't even know . "  |p215To  his chagrin he felt himself blushing . She threw back her head and rocked with laughter . He noticed that the light filtering through the window above the banquette gave her hair a reddish tinge . It was pretty hair . " Would n't it be more romantic if I took on a stage name ? I hate my real one and it 's a good time to get rid of it . To you I am Tanya . I 've always wanted to be Tanya and have a waxen complexion and jet-black hair and dangerous , almondshapedeyes . " He looked so foolish and miserable that she let her hand rest on his for an instant . " Sorry , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how pleased and flattered I am to be here with you . I ca n't really believe it 's true . Tell me more about yourself  --  yourfamily and all that sort of thing . And more about your life in Highfield . " " It 's all pretty tame , " he said , still hurt . " It 's not tame to me , " she said . " I do n't know about the offstagelife of tycoons . " " First let 's have the other half of these . " " Good God , what a man ! Well , I suppose I might just as well be fired for a sheep as a lamb . " He ordered another round of drinks and lunch . Then he started to talk at random , haltingly . Her obvious interest dissipatedhis self-consciousness . With increasing eagerness , as his tension relaxed , he poured out to this unknown girl the story of his life ; his early struggles to build Crombie , Hamiltonand Gardiner ; how close to the rocks they had come in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were over the hump . He told her how he had felt about retirement ; the shock of discovering that it was not just a meaningless clause in a pensionplan , but something that applied to him , personally ; the deep hurt when he realized that his company was not only going to get along without him , but was waiting with re/spectfully controlled impatience for him to pass through the door . He told her things that he had not fully realized himselfuntil that moment and that he had certainly never told Jinny  --  his misgivings as to the new role that he was about to play , his desire to make a clean break with his past because he did not think he could face the future in any other way , his life in Highfield and his present , hitherto unexpressed per- plexities about it . " Well that 's about it , " he said finally , " the biography of nobody . " " The biography of a great guy , " she said . " I wish we 'd had a tape recorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scented air of 21 . ' " They were silent , pursuing their own thoughts . " And now , " he said , " a word about my unknown friend . " She shook her head . " No , " she said . " There is nothing worth telling . Only bad girls make good biographies . " " But what in the world is a girl like you doing in Statistics ? " " I used to ask myself that question . I guess I was always good at math . Girls are n't supposed to be , I know , but I was just queer . When Tom and I broke up , my world was so shattered that I had to do something to put it in order or go stark , raving nuts . Figures are orderly . They 're the antithesis of confusion . They know nothing about half-truths . You add them up and there is the truth . Take it or leave it . I did n't have any training , of course , but it seemed to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me  --  adding up freight-car numbers or something . So I applied and to my dismay they hired me . And that 's the biography of a washout . " " And now you 're the head of the department , " he said , " that 's quite a washout . How many years have you been there ? I ought to know but I do n't . " " Five , come December seventeenth at precisely nine o'clock . "  | " Quite an achievement , " he said . " Quite an achievement . " " No reflection on your management , but the competition was n't very keen . " " Well , it 's too late to start worrying about that now , " he said . " I 'm out from under . A free man . " I wonder , " she said . " Wonder what ? " " How free you are . As you told me your story you sounded a little bit like a lost man and there 's quite a difference . " He looked at her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I should n't have . I do n't really know why I said it . Skip it . " " But people do n't say things without a reason . " " I truly could n't put it into words . Forgive me . It just seems to me that anyone who has contributed so much to the world over so many years ca n't suddenly stop contributing . Men like you are creative just as much as if you were writers or composers or artists or what have you . Painters do n't throw down their brushes when they 're sixty-five and go around shouting I 'm free . ' Writers do n't jump on their typewriters . Musicians do n't drop their instruments in the river . A creative man never ceases to have a creative future as long as his arteries remain open . " He was irritated with her for the first time . " Listen , " he said . " I 've been working like a horse since I graduated from college . I deserve my day in the sun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was being selfish . The world needs men like you so very badly . But you 've earned your right to happiness , God knows . It was just your mention of freedom that got me started . I 'm not quite sure what freedom is , but I have some rather unorthodox ideas about it . " She looked at her wrist watch . " Good gracious . It 's almost quarter of three . Just exactly what am I going to say when I stagger into the dignified offices of Crombie , Hamiltonand Gardiner in the middle of the afternoon surroundedp218by a not-too-faint aroma of Eau de barroom ? Shall I say , The Founder abducted me and got me tight ' ? " " Look haughty and keep still . Remember you 're an executivenow and executives never explain . " He paid the check . They descended to the first floor , passed through the ceaseless swirl of customers and greeters just insidethe entrance and were once more on 52nd Street . An empty cab swerved to the curb . " I 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tiptoe she threw one arm around his neck and kissed him , hard . " That 's for freedom and a wonderfullunch , " she said . Then she was gone . He did n't even know her name . He walked east to Fifth Avenue . Walking would give him time to think . Someone had once said that New York was like ancient Baghdad ; a place where anything could happen , howeverimprobable . But to have it happen right in his own office was something else . When Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner began to go Baghdad it was disturbing . Or had it been just Crombie ? How would he ever dare enter the place again ? As he walked , a strange feeling of emptiness took possession of him and increased until it became almost unbearable . Somethinghad come into his life which had momentarily satisfied an unconscious hunger . Now it was gone and the realization caused the sunny world of Central Park to look suddenly grim and forbidding . What the hell was the matter with him  --  was he getting senile ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was somehow a relief . He threw himself on the bed to think and in a few minutes was snoring gently . He was awakened some time later by the small noises of Jinny moving about the room . " I can always tell when you 've had lunch at the Club , " she said . " Two or three of those lethal martinis and you 're out like a lamp most of the afternoon . "  | " They should be prohibited by law , " he said , yawning sleepily . It was the first time he had ever deceived her . But what alternative did he have ? No woman since Eve had ever believed a story such as his . TIME PASSED SO QUICKLY THATthey failed to see autumn shouldering summer off the stage , until one day the maples began to turn and the air was speckled with falling leaves . Sunset Hill was finally rounding into shape . Mr. Crombie was face to face at last with the projects and plans he had dreamed about on that transcontinental jet almost a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse for procrastination . This realization made him vaguely uneasy . There was something wrong and he could n't put his finger on it . He tried hard to be conscientious about his morning schedule , but it just did n't seem to work out . The trouble was that the world refused to hold sacred the privacy of a man who was merely reading . People read in subway trains and in hamburgerjoints . Why should anyone have to shut himself up in a room to do it ? As a matter of fact , why should anyone choose the busiest time of day to read at all ? Even Mrs. Crombie could never quite understand his irritability when she interruptedhim to say that someone wanted him on the phone , or to announce the arrival of the man to fix the dishwasher . It was the same with his afternoon routine . He had planned to spend the last half of each day grooming what he hoped byp220that time would be an almost perfect garden , or producing little gems of handicraft in his workshop or just lying beside some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he had n't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he had n't found it . It was n't his fault that these things were so . The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately . As a result , life had become a kind of continuous makeready . Once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted . Then , at last , his day would fall into an orderedpattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs . His dogs ? He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams . Then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dogs did something to one 's ego . They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world 's great guys . Regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out  --  and even if they did it would make no difference . Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture . What in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons ? You certainly could n't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns . Why in the world could n't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ?  |p221It  worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day . He would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it . How in the world had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case ? Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? Could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? Or was the answer less metaphysical ? Did older people work more slowly ? Did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ? It might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolentto blink their eyes . Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positivelyantagonistic to it . And then again perhaps the reason why he could n't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he did n't want to do them . There was no compulsion behind them . They could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn . During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting . He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch . It wasp222five minutes after four . On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered . He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus committed , action might follow . He went down to Mills and Bradley 's Hardware Store and bought a full set of carpenter 's tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were . He also bought a huge square of pegboardfor hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and T squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for . " There , " said Mr. Mills . " That 'll get you started . Best not to get everything at once . Add things as you find you need ' em . " He did n't even ask the cost of this collection . After all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . When he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , Jinny had gone with a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second car . He was glad . It gave him ap223chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments . He had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable . He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall . That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools . In front of it would be his workbench . The old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he could n't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away . How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? After the pegboard there would be the paneling . He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem . Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes , why did n't they come right out again ? It all seemed rather hopeless . He turned his attention to the workbench . Perhaps that was the first thing to do . A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench . They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot . How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? Perhapshe had better have someone help him put up the pegboardand build the workbench  --  someone who knew what he was about . Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crumb . To his amazement hep224reached him . Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold . He did n't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly . The only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job . That was why he had n't been able to finish the porch . No , he did n't know of any handyman-carpenter . There was n't any such thing any more . Carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother 's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job . There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way . Nobodyliked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk . Mr. Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night . If he was sober , which was doubtful , he 'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie . Mr. Blatz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr. Crombie 's life since he moved to Highfield , in spite of the fact that he did n't work very fast or very long at a time , and he did n't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him . He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they was n't nobody with you . So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. Blatz 's mind from funny things . At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he did n't like to disclosehis ignorance . While Mr. Blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of his idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar . Mr. Blatz agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste . " Now , " he said , " we got to put in some outlets for them power tools ; then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbenchan ' I guess we 're about through down here . " It all did look very efficient and shipshape . There was no question of that . " By the way , " said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , " them power tools needs extra voltage . I guess you know about that . Before you use ' em the light company 's got to run in a heavy line and you 'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits . That ai n't too bad ' ceptin ' the light company 's so busy you ca n't ever get ' em to do nothin ' . " Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the mystery of the power tools . He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs . As usual , Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils . Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . " Well , " he said , " got your man fixed up nice down there . He ought a be able to build a new house with all them contraptions . " Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . " I was just sayin ' to him that I 'm all ready now for anything else you want done . " Mr. Crombie could n't remember his saying any such thing . " Oh , that 's wonderful , " cried Mrs. Crombie . " I have a thousand things for you to do . Doors that wo n't open , and doors that wo n't close and shelves and broken . .. " " But those are the things I built the workshop for , " protestedMr . Crombie . " Those are the things I can do , now that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get these things done for months , " she said . " We wo n't live long enough if I wait for you , besidesp226which you do n't need to worry  --  there 'll be plenty more . " But the discussion was academic . Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink . Mr. Blatz had peculiar ideas about being paid . Up to this point he had only been willing to accept a small amount each week , paid on account . When he had finally finished the last item on Mrs. Crombie 's list , he was paid in full with a sizable check . Grinning from ear to ear he rattled out of the driveway in his old pickup truck , waving gaily as he turned into the main road . They never saw him again . Questioned about him , Mr. Crumb said he 'd heard he 'd been put in some institution for the D.T. 's , but that might be just loose talk . The little house where he lived was closed up and eventually a bulldozer removed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for a Thruway . Whenever Mr. Crombie had occasion to go into the cellar , he always snapped on the fluorescent lights and looked at his workshop with pride . Everything was spotless . Each tool hung straight and true . The power tools were concealed beneath neat canvas covers . The lights were reflected by the waxed paneling . Some day he 'd have to hang a few pictures down here . Then he would return upstairs , happy in the knowledge that at least one project had been brought to a successful conclusion.  |p227THERE  WAS A FEELING OF SNOWin the air . The sun was setting behind a lattice of bare branches . A lonely chill crept up from the valley . The eveningbreeze , moving through the leafless trees , sang in an alien tongue ; one that Mr. Crombie felt he was not meant to understand . Nature was taking over for the night . He hurried to finish cutting up the pile of branches beside the sawbuck , with the consciousness of intruding in a world from which he was forever barred . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armload on the rapidly growing pile of kindling . His woodpile , neatly separated into different sizes , had become a measure of his daily accomplishment . Picking out a big log for storage on the back porch , he started for the house . Through the shaft of yellow light streaming from the kitchen window passed the first snowflakes of the season . Mrs. Crombie was preparing dinner . He stood for a moment and watched her . There was a tense , worried look in her face . How she hated cooking . And how patient and uncomplainingshe had been about it . It made him feel guilty as he realized that she was doing all this for him . Her face lit up as she heard the kitchen door open . " Hi , " she said . " I was afraid the trolls had taken you . You 're not goingto have a very good dinner tonight . I 've been trying top228make veal scaloppine and it just does n't scaloppine . I 've done everything exactly the way the book says . I guess I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just too bright to stand over a stove and stir things . " " Nuts , " she said . " There are plenty of women a lot brighter than I am who can find their way around a kitchen . Go fix the martinis . I 'll let this mess simmer . " He thought she looked particularly appealing in her smudged work apron , with her hair mussed and that frustratedlook in her eyes . Women who were habitually poised were always more appealing when caught off balance . " I 'm having a luncheon tomorrow for the Women 's Committee of the Community Chest , " she said . " Do you suppose you could shift for yourself , darling ? I hate to put you out , but twelve women would drive you crazy . They do me . " She was in balance again . " Oh , sure , " he said . " I 'll beat it out of here early . " " But where will you go ? You have no Club to hole up in around Highfield . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , vaguely . " I 'll have lunch with some of the college crowd . " What college crowd ? " she asked curiously . " We do n't know any of them . " " Oh , I 've met a few , " he said noncommittally . " I might drop in on Professor Turner . " On the following day he took the car shortly after noon and started down the road without the slightest idea where he was going . He was filled with a sense of having failed somehow . When he had moved to Highfield he had thought that a person with his financial and business experience would be God 's gift to a town of this size . Now at the end of six months he was beginning to realize that whatever financial assistance he might render to the businessmen of Highfield would be in the form of checks drawn in their favor.  |p229He  had conceived of this rural community as his new workshop  --  a place where he could continue to build as he had at Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sound financial basis . After that he would bolster up its civic pride . He would teach it to clean up the litter on the green and outside Gates Drug Store , to put some paint on the firehouse and to take better care of its beautiful old trees . He would get them doing square dances ( about which he knew nothing ) and introduce evening art classes ( about which he knew less ) . He would develop a historic consciousness . A town as old as Highfield must have a history . He had even toyed with the idea of making a New England Williamsburg out of the place . These had been mere formless dreams , but it had not taken him long to realize that the Village Fathers had other ideas . Here was no community of amiable yokels and picturesque characters waiting to be molded . The inhabitants of Highfield were quite as close to the modern world as Mr. Crombie and in many ways appeared better able to cope with it . The only thing they retained from the past was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to drop their chewing-gum wrappers and old newspapers . No one was going to make monkeys of them with crazy things like square dances , nor were they going to be costumed figures in a museum village . They were freemen and if one of them wanted to build an abattoir on his property next of the VillageGreen it was his inalienable right to do so . For some reason Jinny had fitted into the picture much better than he had . It was true that she had not been obliged to contend with the flinty group who controlled the political destinies of the village , but in many ways their wives were of even tougher fiber . In spite of this they had accepted Jinny almost immediately , placing her on their committees , seeking her advice , and before long following her leadership . He had never had an opportunity before to observe her in action.  |p230Now  he had nothing but admiration for her ability and tact ; admiration that was seasoned with a dash of hurt pride . He drove down the hill to the village . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crumb . Mr. Crombie pulled over to the curb . " You fellows want to have lunch with me ? " he asked . They looked puzzled . " We 're both going home to lunch right now , " said Mr. Battle . " Glad to have you come and take pot luck if you got nothing better to do . " " Me , too , " said Mr. Crumb . They looked at him curiously , obviously wondering why he was n't going home for lunch like everyone else . It had been stupid of him . The only place to eat in the village was Joe 's Place , which was only suitable if one was starving and even that was subject to debate . " No , thanks , " he said embarrassed . " Thanks very much . My wife 's having a committee meeting . " He left them to ruminate over this statement . " Odd fellow , " said Mr. Crumb . " Nervous type . He called me up the other day and give me hell for not getting that porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to sit out there all winter . Do n't seem to realize there 's a school job goin ' on in this town . " " Might be he 's tryin ' to get away from his wife , " said Mr. Battle , following a line of thought closer to his heart . " About the only way you can live with some women is to run away from ' em . " Mr. Crombie drove through the village and at the crossroads , a mile out , he turned left on the Middleburg road . There would be some place in a college town to get a decent lunch and then ... What then ? He might call on old ProfessorTurner . No , the old man would be busy and in any event he did n't want to listen to a discussion of the intolerable qualities of the professor 's associates . He 'd go to the movies . Must be one in Middleburg.  |p231He  ate lunch in a students ' cafeteria , reading a copy of the Middleburg Reporter which the last customer had left on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a small building , badly ventilated and filled with students of both sexes who had come there more for the purpose of expressingtheir mutual desire than to see the picture . The film had to do with the adventures of two female impersonators who got into trouble with the police and concealedthemselves among a group of WACs who were embarkingfor some Pacific outpost . The air in the little theater weighed on him like a German feather bed and after a while he fell asleep . The clatter of machine guns wakened him with a start . Where was he ? For a moment it was his inclinationto drop down between the seats . Then things swam into focus . The faintly illuminated clock on the side wall indicated five minutes before four . The female impersonators were beingchased by someone . Then they both fell into the arms of two blonde WACs , a general fell off a dock and the picture was over . Mr. Crombie sleepily joined the crowd of young men and women inching their way up the aisle hand in hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Highfieldthrough the anemic sunlight of a late winter day . Of all the fatuous ways to spend an afternoon , this was it ! What was the matter with him ? He had always prided himself on being rich in resources . Now he began to wonder . He was a book lover who did n't read , a music lover who never went to hear any music , a student of nature who never bothered to look at it , a gardener who pulled up the flowers and left the weeds to grow . He was a phony  --  that 's what he was . A hapless dreamer of impractical dreams . The only thing he knew anything about was how to handle people , and run a business . But that was behind him ; something belonging to the past . If he was goingp232to have a future he must work on it just as hard as he had worked on his past . No more afternoons like this . The Committee had left by the time he reached the house . Jinny was pushing the vacuum cleaner around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " shooting the breeze with a lot of old college professors all afternoon . I 'm never going to let you do that again  --  throwing you out of your own house . " " Oh , I did n't mind it , " he said . " It 's a good thing to get out once in a while and see the world . " " God , those women were deadly , " she said . He felt better . ON NIGHTS WHEN JANUARY WINDStore across the valley , battering angrily at the old house and rattling its windows ; on mornings when , numb with cold , he struggled to start the half-frozen car before the batteries were exhausted ; on days when driving southeast rainstorms created a sea of mud around the house  --  at such times he found himselftrying to remember just what it was that had caused him to decide that this was the setting best suited to what were cheerily referred to as the declining years . By mid-January , winter really went to work on Highfield . The snow fell quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which had already accumulated , until the earth was muted under a thick sparkling blanket and the big plows had transformed the roads into white-walled corridors.  |p233The  plow drivers were friendly people and they kept Mr. Crombie 's driveway open as far as the kitchen door . There it ended in a mountain of snow . With backbreaking exertion he shoveled a path to the barn just wide enough for a wheelbarrowloaded with firewood . It was rather shocking to him to find how soft he was after almost eight months of country life . Fifteen minutes of digging made him lean panting on the shovel , listening to his heart thumping against his ribs like a trapped animal trying to break through and escape . He had never realized that being a successful country gentleman was so much a matter of muscles . The weekly round-trip to New York had become a perilous and uncertain adventure . They would start out on a clear road and end up crawling over glare ice , fed by a half-frozen drizzle which coated the windshield with ice until the wiper was immobilizedand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head out the window like an old-time locomotive engineer . Their friends in New York could not understand why they persisted in struggling back to the wilderness each week at a time when New York was offering its most beguiling charms . But Mr. Crombie was adamant . " We are country people , " he would say . " Highfield is our home , just the way New York is yours . " Mrs. Crombie said nothing , and hours later , when they found the entrance to Sunset Hill blocked by drifted snow , he was inclined to agree with her silence . Then came the January thaw . The winds subsided . The sun blazed fiercely down on the white world . From underneaththe drifts and the man-made piles , little rivulets began to flow . The hard-pressed snow on the roads became slush , tossed and retossed by flying wheels . The surface of the earth turned from ice to water . With the change , the sounds of the living world were once more released , the gurgle of runningbrooks , the drip of eaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch.  |p234In  Mr. Crombie 's immaculate cellar , water began to appear on the gleaming walls , moving slowly downward , drop by drop . It came from everywhere and nowhere and the merged drops finally turned the cellar floor into a shallow lake . Mr. Barnhauser , hastily summoned , came up to look the situation over . He did n't seem particularly disturbed . " What you expect , all this water drippin ' off the eaves ? Just lies there against your foundations . Got ta go somewhere . All these old houses got leaky cellars this time a'year . " " But ca n't you do anything about it ? " Mr. Crombie was not used to situations which could not be controlled . " No . It 'll stop when the ground freezes again . Then it 'll dry up in the spring . Oh , of course you can mop it up if you 've a mind but I would n't bother . Just wear a pair of galoshes when you go down in the cellar . Feels to me like we 're due for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the roads froze into coral-like ridges . The snow acquired a glittering crust . Down , down , down went the mercury . No heat found its way into the guestroomwing . On Monday night the water pipes in the guest bathroom broke and the water , long penned by a core of ice , rushed joyously through the breech over the bathroom floor , under the bathroom door and into the bedroom . They did n't discover it until the following morning . " For pity 's sake do n't just stand there looking at it , " said Mrs. Crombie . " Go down and shut something off . " He put on his galoshes and went down . In one corner a ganglia of pipes disappeared into the crawl space under the guest room . There were valves everywhere  --  most of them marked with red tags on which some former owner had writtencabalistic notations like " 2-B " and " D-4 . " Mr. Crombie stared at them thoughtfully for a long while . Finally he turned all the valves off , and sloshed his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the galoshes and carried them in his hand to the guest room , where he putp235them on again and entered the bathroom . Water continued to pour through the plaster and under the baseboard . He could hear it gurgling contentedly within the confines of the wall . The place was getting like a marina . Mrs. Crombie came to the door . " Something else has happened , " she said . " There 's no water running anywhere in the house . I 've been all around . " " It 's all coming out here , " he said . " Why in the world does n't this one stop when all the others do ? " " I do n't know . Do n't ask me silly questions . Maybe the place is bewitched . I just do n't know . " His face had the dazed look of one suffering from shock . " I just do n't know , " he repeated . " You 'd better get that new plumber up here before we all start floating down the road like a houseboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Parsons , the new plumber , was not home . His wife thought he was working on the school job . Mr. Crombie eventually found him there , or at least he found his legs , which were planted on the top of a stepladder and disappeared through a hole in the ceiling from which a rhythmic clanking sound emerged . " Is this Mr. Parsons ? " asked Mr. Crombie , addressing the legs . The clanking ceased . " Yes , " came a voice , Jehovah-like . " I 'm Graham Crombie . The rhythmic clanking resumed . " There 's a pipe busted in my guest bathroom . " " They 're poppin ' like balloons all over town , " said the voice . " Always do , this kinda freeze . Did you turn off the water ? " " I ca n't find the spigot , or whatever you call it . " The feet began to descend the ladder and Mr. Parsons , covered with dirt , hove into view . " I do n't know where it is , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looked for it ? " " I turned off everything I could find , " said Mr. Crombie.  | " And do n't that do it ? " Mr. Crombie shook his head miserably . " Everything else is shut off but the leak . " Mr. Parsons shook his head , also , but in the manner of one who gives up trying to deal sensibly with a moron . " All right , " he said . " I 'll be up in two-three hours . Damage 's done now . Little more water ai n't gon na hurt none . " Mr. and Mrs. Crombie sat helplessly in front of the livingroomfire and waited for him . The gurgle from the guest-room bath and the incessant tick , tick of the water pump running nonstop in the cellar formed a background for their gloomy thoughts . " Let 's go to New York , " said Mr. Crombie . Mrs. Crombie alerted like a setter aroused from its dreams by the sound of a welcome step outside the door . " Oh , Gray , could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only be until the first of April , " he said , severely . " As a mater of fact , if we go down to visit the Carringtons in Delray in March we wo n't be in town more than six weeks . " " Oh , darling , " she said , her lethargy gone . " Let 's celebrate . I 'll drive down and get a big juicy steak and one of Mrs. Peterson 's pies and you can build a huge fire in the diningroomfireplace . " " I do n't know why we have to celebrate because the house is sinking and we 're abandoning ship . " She did not heed this . " And we 'll put out the best china . A full-dress feast , complete with candlelight . " " To hell with the water pipe , " said Mr. Crombie . " I 'll see if there 's any of that Chianti left . "  |p237THEY  RETURNED TO HIGHFIELD ONApril first . Mr. Battle had become the self-appointed superintendent of Sunset Hill . During their absence he had not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite on his own , had had the bathroom replastered and repainted and the cellar walls waterproofed . He had even persuaded Mr. Crumb to start work on the screened porch . The bills for these various jobs , plus ten per cent for Mr. Battle , lay in a neat pile on Mr. Crombie 's writing table . " It 's lucky we came back , " he said , " before that ass Battle redecorated the whole house . " Like a capricious woman , April changed its moods a dozen times a day . At one moment the hot sun would bring out the intangible , intoxicating smell of spring . Life was poised just beneath the earth like an actor waiting in the wings for his cue . Then suddenly a puff of cold wind would come sweeping up the valley . The cloudless sky of a moment before would become gray and dour and a chill rain would move like a curtainacross the fields and forests . April , harbinger of spring and child of winter , was always luring one with soft promises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought garden books , garden tools , garden seeds . He was ready , whenever April would make up its mind , to cover the black earth with flaming beauty , although he was n't very sure what the little seed packets with the funny names contained.  |p238And  then , one morning , they saw the first green shimmeringin the trees at the edge of the forest ; a shade so delicate that it disappeared as one approached it . The grass had suddenlybecome greener and the song of birds rose from the bushes on the edges of the fields . " Spring is going to be beautiful in Highfield , " said Mr. Crombie . " We ought to plan our weekends  --  who we want and all that sort of thing . Otherwise we 'll get jammed up with a whole lot of people we do n't care a hoot about , and wo n't be able to have the kids . " " Who probably wo n't want to come anyway , " she said . But nevertheless she brought a pad and they made out a schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have only one family at a time and they wanted them all frequently . Then there were people to whom they were indebted and people to whom they wanted to show Sunset Hill and people that they just plain wanted to see . It was a formidable list . " Do you realize , " she said , " that a crowd like this would n't leave us one single weekend to ourselves from now until Christmas ? " " That 's nonsense , " he said , " I want every other weekend free . " " Then you 'll have to cut out everybody but the children , and you 'll have to cut down on them . " They finally reached a compromise which left them with three free weekends , up to Labor Day . " I 'll get the children anchored first , " she said . " Then we 'll have to sign up Mrs. Frankenthal and a maid for the rest of their lives . " " This thing is going to be awfully expensive , is n't it ? " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a houseful almost every weekend you certainly ca n't expect me to entertain them and do all the work besides . " " Oh , of course not , " he said hastily . " I think I 'll do somep239work in my library now . I wo n't have much time from here in with guests and children and gardening and everything . " " You mean you 'll read while I sit on the telephone and call all these people , " she said . When he saw her at lunch she looked disturbed . " Did you get the kids nailed down ? " he asked . " You 're not going to like this , dear . I talked to them all . Each family has agreed to come once during the spring , but then I 'm afraid that 's more or less that for the time being . They wo n't be pinned down too far ahead . You see , darling , you have to look at this from their point of view . " " I know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , it 's the truth , dear . " " Yes , and it 's also the truth that if we offered to take their children off their hands so that they could go somewhere , they 'd jump at it . " " Of course they would , dear . Do n't you remember how we used to try to pawn off the children on your family when they were little ? You must stop being hurt all the time and try to get used to the fact that they 've grown up . They 're not childrenany more ; they have children . They 're adults leading their own lives and would n't you hate them if they did n't . " Do you remember how poor Mother used to plead with us to come out to Cleveland for Christmas or Easter or to spend our vacation with her at the camp ? I suppose this kind of thing has gone on since people lived in caves . If parents could only realize that there comes a point where your children do n't really need you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need us , " he broke in impatiently . " They need us when they pile up a stack of doctors ' bills , and when it looked as if Pat 's marriage was headed for the reefs , she came running to us fast enough , and what would have happenedwhen Dexter lost his job if we had n't been ready to help ? " " I know , " she said , " and that 's the way they ought to needp240us  --  in the pinches , not all day long . We 're there like a backstop . And they know it . And they 'd feel adrift if we were n't , but they 're outside , that 's the point . They 're no longer in the enclosure . And they unconsciously resent any attempt to drag them back . " You always get so psychological , " he said . " We buy this lovely place so we can see our grandchildren . It 's as simple as that . And then , when we ask them to come , everybody gets Freudian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replying . " I 'll tell you what they want us to do , " she said finally , " and we ought to be smart enough to want to do it . They want us to lead our own lives . We led our own lives before they came and now it 's time to pick up where we left off . We did n't buy this place for them . We bought it for ourselves because it represented a way of life we wanted . " " I suppose you 're right , " he said . " I 'm sure you 're right . But I do n't like it any better for that . It makes the whole thing seem rather empty . . . pointless . " " Listen , dear . The trouble is that when people get to this chapter we 're talking about , they begin to look backward instead of forward . They do n't see any future  --  just past . Now , darling , we have a future , you and I. You have one . I have one . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been watching you get the backward look for over a year now . It worries me . You 're a dynamic person . I hate that word ; everything 's dynamic ' these days . But that 's what you are . And dynamic means motion . At least I think it does . And as far as human beings are concerned , there 's only one way for motion to go for my money and that 's forward . " Her voice had become suddenly tense . He looked at her , trying to read in her troubled eyes the import of her words . She resumed her seat , grinning sheepishly . " Gracious , what an outburst . Well , now , back to the weekend schedule . Let'sp241see whether our friends feel the same about us as our chil-dren . " They sat long over the list . " The trouble is , " she said , " we owe so many people . We 've been lazy . " " It 's not laziness , " he said , " but there 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here for the weekend ... " " I wish I could get that on a tape recorder , " she said , " and send it to the kids . But we 've got to pay these people back . Now look . You ca n't have the Applegates with the Browns . That 's for sure . They 'd kill each other at the end of twelve hours . I suppose we must have the Hendersons , but I dread it . She 's stiff as a poker and he 's one of those weekend drinkerswith all the standard reactions . Before Saturday night is over I feel like slipping on a suit of armor . Yes , the Cranshaws , I suppose . God , they 're bores . " " Why do we accept so much hospitality from people we do n't seem to like ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " she said , " but I 'm sure you ca n't tear them up and throw them away now . They 're here , sitting in the middle of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be on the end of a telephone trying to get them to come to Sunset Hill . " " I think I 'll plant some of those seeds , " he said . " Oh , darling , please wait until we can plan it out together . Do n't you think . . . " " I 'm not a complete fool , " he said indignantly . " All you do is poke them in the ground . " " Of course you 're not . And I suppose if you 're going to have a future you might start it in much worse ways than poking seeds in the ground . Remember not to put them in upsidedown . " The sun was hot in the angle of the house . Mr. Crombie sat on the warm flagstones and studied the little seed en/velopes . What was in Jinny 's mind ? What was all this about new chapters and futures ? Probably nothing . She was always dressing up simple ideas in costumes . He ought to put these tall jobs in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . Tall in the back , ground huggers in front . As he carefully planted the seeds in neat rows he was suddenlyseized with the same sense of futility that had come over him so frequently during recent weeks . What in the world was he , Graham Crombie , doing , kneeling on an alien terrace , poking seeds into the ground in the middle of a spring afternoon ? The question irritated him . He was gardening , and gardening was a time-honored occupation , creative and healthful . But who in hell cared whether he planted these seeds or not ? What difference did it make ? That was it . What differencedid it make ? He sat for a long time staring at the little envelopes . The flowers depicted on them looked so gay and colorful that he felt somehow disloyal as he laid the envelopes carefully in the wicker basket and placed his gardening gloves on top of them . Something within him was struggling for expression . He needed to be alone , to be with himself without even the cornpanyof a packet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the path over the brook and into the woods . During the past weeks he had cleared it roughly to a point where it ran into an old wagon track that led down to the valley . He turned into it now , walking as fast as the surface of the ground permitted . He wanted to think , but he was n't quite sure what he wanted to think about . Something was disturbing him profoundly , but he could n't bring it into focus . " You have a future , " she had said . But the trouble was that , to his business-trainedmind , a future meant only one thing : new obstacles to be overcome , new heights to be scaled . Thatp243meant business . There must be roads to achievement , however , which did not lead through the commercial jungle . At the moment he could not think of any that he was capable of following , or wanted to if he could . But what was the matter with the road which he had chosen ? Was n't he writing the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And under the most ideal conditions ? Was n't this where his future lay ; serene , peaceful , contented ? The wagon track came out on a narrow hard-surfaced road . Turning to the right he walked furiously , seeking the muscularfatigue that alone would cure the inexplicable turmoil within him . THEY SAT ON THE TERRACE WATCHingthe setting sun balance itself for an instant on the knife edge of the purple hills . " Whoever named this place Sunset Hill named it well , " she said . " It 's so beautiful at this time of day that sometimes it makes me want to cry . " The sun burrowed into the hill like a hen settling herself on her eggs . " On second thought , " she said , " I 'll make you cry instead . That 's more fun . I finishedbegging people to come for a weekend about an hour ago and if you ever ask me to do a job like that again I 'll divorce you . I 'd rather arrange a Summit Conference . Comep244inside where you can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , " she said , settling herself beside the lamp and puttingon her glasses . " The kids are coming on these four weekends . Generously , magnanimously and unselfishly they have agreed to that . I 've kept three weekends free on the improbablechance that someone might ask us somewhere and every other weekend from now through August is tied up tighter than a drum . There it is , baby . You 'd better start negotiatingwith your liquor dealer . " As he read the list his face registered consternation . " But my Lord , Jinny , most of these people are n't the ones we decided on . " " I know it , " she said . " But every time I 'd get one couple nailed down , nobody else could come on that particular weekend . There were very few of them that I wanted to sit staring at all by themselves for three days , so I had to shop around until I found a pair of lonely hearts to go with them . I 'll admit it has resulted in some odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We seem to know the most forwardplanninggroup of people in America . " " But we hardly know the Thurstons . Why should we have them . And with the Andy Bruces , of all people . And the Carters . They 're dreadful . Why the Carters , for heaven'sfsake ? " i " Because you wanted to fill your weekends , and I could n't find anyone else . I told you that . Maybe you could get some work out of them around the place . " " Would n't it be cheaper and pleasanter if we were to cancelthe whole thing and go abroad ? " he said . " You know  --  urgent and unexpected business  --  terribly sorry . ' , , " No , dear , " she said . " We 've joined the weekend set at the hard end and we 're going to enjoy it if it kills us . Maybe it will be more fun than it looks from here . "  |p245MR  . CROMBIE HAD FOUND LITTLEenough time for the daily chores when they lived a quiet normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staying ( God forbid ) until Monday morning , he had no time for anything . His mail lay unopened on the writing table . His books stood on the shelves as unread as ever . He had turned over the grass-cutting to a pack of young men who had reduced the operation to a kind of lawn ballet . Now , unable to cope any longer with the garden , he handed it over to this same group . When he remembered the hours he had spent on his knees picking out grass blades from between tender petals of iris , he was filled with awe as he watched these young men rush into the flower beds , leaving them at the end of an hour as weedlessly sterile as the beds of Rockefeller Plaza . By these ruinously expensive means he had reduced his outdoor responsibilities to wandering around with a wheelbarrow , picking up broken branches , Jinny 's prunings and odds and ends of paper which were forever being blown about the lawn . Late on Friday afternoon the week 's assignment of guests would arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only temporary . They screamed with pleasure at the view . They could n't wait to see the house , and they deliveredp246their tithes of candy , books and liquor to the usual accompanimentof protests . At first Mr. Crombie welcomed the donations of liquor as so many extra dividends . Later he came to regard these gifts with apprehension , particularly in the case of two-bottle donors who , having deposited them on the piano with a loud bang to assure their having been properly noted , would then cast off the role of guest and assume a kind of suzerainty over Mr. Crombie 's entire supply of bottled goods , suggesting from time to time that it might be a good thing if everyone had a quick snort , after which , without more ado , they would pour unmeasured slugs of Mr. Crombie 's best Scotch , or insist on refilling people 's glasses long before they were empty . " That stuff wo n't do you any good . Let me chuck it out and get you a real one . " In the beginning Mr. Crombie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a weekend would welcomethe opportunity to tone up their flaccid muscles and to draw a little pure air into their carbon-coated lungs . In anticipation of this he made up lists of odd jobs that he had been trying to get done for weeks . He would lead up to the subject with studied obliqueness . " How would you fellows like to take it easy this morning and fool around the place ? Put on your old clothes . I 'm going to dabble around a bit . I do n't want you to do any work , of course , but if you 're itching to get your hands dirty I 've got a lot of tools in the barn . " They would follow him with the sagging shoulders of condemnedmen who , with ropes around their necks , were being asked to dig their own graves . " Here 's a turf-cutter , Bill . If you want to cut back the grass along the walks it will be a great help . Not bad fun , either . And here 's a pair of snippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace need thinning out . " They took the tools without enthusiasm and followed himp247back to the terrace where he tried to instill a little elan into the occasion by keeping up a nonstop pep talk . " It sure is good to get out in the sun and do a little light bending and twisting . That 's the trouble with us old fellows . Never get any exercise . We do n't need heavy exercise . That 's the last thing we want . It 's just the twisting and turning stuff that 's so good for what ails you . Do you remember Walter Camp 's Daily Dozen ? He went to the Zoo and studied tigers .... " They listened apathetically and eventually laid down their tools in inconspicuous places , where he would find them rustingdays later , if ever . Lowering themselves quietly into the big wooden terrace chairs they watched him work , chatting lazily of this and that and with one eye carefully noting the progress of the sun toward its juncture with the yardarm . THE WEEKEND WITH THE BEAMSand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard it as one of the turning points of his life . Joe Beam had roomed with him at Harvard , and had been associated with him in various business ventures ever since . Henry Buckley had been one of the wheel horses of Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner . Both of them had retired shortly after Mr. Crombie . Joe had been the head of a big electrochemical company with plants scattered across the country . He was a huge man , with enormous drive , which for years had kept him moving restlessly over the length and breadth of the United States ,  |p248ins|pecting  his various branches , attending conventions , makingspeeches , keeping himself posted on the activities of his competitors . As a result he knew everyone worth knowing in the businesshierarchy and in spite of his blatant masculinity he had a woman 's sense for gossip . If a merger was in the offing , if a company was having difficulty with its bank credit , if a corporatehead was about to fall , Joe Beam knew about it almost before those involved . Henry Buckley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with people , Henry Buckley 's with figures . He read balance sheets and income statements as a musician reads a score . Figures told Henry Buckley immediately what was wrong with a company , what its stock was worth or the proper terms of a prospective merger . His uncanny ability along these lines had brought much valuable business to Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner . Joe had retired a few months after Mr. Crombie , declaring that he proposed to spend the rest of his life traveling . He wanted to settle down in each country he visited long enough to study its history and its folkways . Whatever he did , one could be sure he would do it thoroughly . At the end of eight months he and his wife had returned to New York scarcely on speaking terms after forty years of congenial married life . Now they were based in a little apartment in New York from which they made sudden impulsive darts to all parts of the world . It was a doubtful compromise . Henry , on the other hand , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his time . Why he had suddenly taken to the sea nobody knew , unless it was that the compactness of shipboard life appealed to his tidy , mathematical mind . After a winter spent mildewing on the coasts of Florida he had changed his mind , or rather , Mrs. Buckley had changed it for him . The boat was about to bep249sold and they were also living in a small apartment hotel in New York trying to reorient themselves . " Sure , traveling was a good life , " said Joe Beam . " Nobody knew better than I did how lucky I was to have a wife who was enough of a tramp to enjoy that sort of existence . Everythinglooked fine , but just sitting around in Saint-Jean-de-Luz reading French history did n't add up to anything . That is , for me it did n't . " Neither does the life we 're living now , dashing around like a couple of nervous bird dogs . Sure it 's fun to fly down to the Bang Bang Club for a weekend of bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in some religious ringding , but so what ? I 'm so constituted that trips like that must be a reward for effort , not just a means of killing time . " " That 's just the way I feel , " said Henry Buckley . " I wake up in the morning all set to lead a life of high achievement and then I suddenly realize that nobody cares whether my achievement is high or low or whether I achieve at all . How in the world can you accomplish anything if nobody cares ? Even the medieval monks who spent their lives in cells illuminatingpages of the Bible must have known that eventuallysomeone besides God would appreciate their work . " Joe nodded . " I agree with you . A fellow has to be working toward an end or he 'll find himself weaving baskets . You ca n't live in a vacuum or as a dot surrounded by infinity . You have to have a goal , and a time limit for getting there , and competition . If you 're not matching your brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ? " Mr. Crombie listened and said little , but he found this conversationdisturbing . The very things that had been troubling him vaguely for over a year were troubling these men as well . " Why do you suppose it is , " he said , finally , " that other men seem able to retire successfully ? Why should we find ourselvesmisfits in a world that seems to suit others perfectly ? "  |p250There  it was ; the admission that he was a misfit in the world of Highfield and Sunset Hill . He had not been prepared to cross this line , but now that it had been done he felt an immenseload lifted from his shoulders . He noticed Jinny watching him with an odd expression on her face . Joe Beam answered it . " Because it 's the way we 're made  --  all three of us . We thrive on competition and we fall apart without it . Being what we are , we lived the kind of life we did and now we ca n't live any other . Luckily for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of men who 've retiredand never lifted a finger the rest of their lives . And they 've been happy as clams . That 's about what they were , in my opinion . When they retired it was n't into a new life . They just kept on doing what they 'd always done  --  nothing . " " That 's pretty rough , " said Henry Buckley , " but I agree with your premise . Men do n't change their characteristics just because they 're sixty-five , whether they want to or not . We just happen to have been thrown up on the beach by a clause in a pension plan and we have n't been able to find our way back to the water . " " You 're so right , " said Joe . " It 's hard to find your way back to the water after you 've been given the old heave ho into the seaweed . You know what ? I wish the three of us could dream up something that would give us an excuse to have an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " I 'm sorry but you lads have to break it up , " said Mrs. Crombie , glancing at her wrist watch . " We 're going to drive over to Sky Mountain for dinner and on the way we 're stoppingin to see Sam Baker 's new house in Bradbury and have cocktails with them . After that we 're taking them to dinner with us. "  |p251AUGUST  ARRIVED , HOT AND STEAMing . Mr. Crombie walked down to the post office rather enjoying the feeling of sweat trickling down his face and soaking his shirt . Oswald Battle was sitting in front of his antique shop fanning himself with an old newspaper . " Why is it , do you suppose , " asked Mr. Battle without preliminarygreeting , " that city folk pay such enormous prices to go to the country in the summer ? If it was any hotter than this in the city , folks 'd be cooked . " Mr. Crombie nodded . He had been turning this very idea over in his mind as he came down the hill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk any more , " he said with some pride . " We 've been here over a year now . We moved in a year ago June 20 . " " You do n't think that buys you citizenship in Highfield , I hope , " said Mr. Battle . " These people do n't measure by years  --  they measure by generations . If your family came here in the 1600s you 're automatically in . An ' I suppose they 'd recognize the 1700S , with qualifications . But after that they begin to get picky and choosy . You know Henry Blossom that has the farm about a mile up the road from you ? Well , his family'sbeen here since they took over the place from the Indians . But he married a girl from Middleburg . He married her forty years ago , but Highfield folk still speak of her as a foreigner . "  |p252The  post office was deserted except by its usual smell of damp , decaying paper . There were only half a dozen letters in his box ; three or four bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a real-estate agent in Middleburg that he 'd never heard of and a letter from Who 's Who . They probablywanted him to revise proof on his write-up . He had planned to stop on his way back for a chat with Oswald Battle , but the latter had left his seat in front of the shop and the shop itself was closed . A little note had been stuck in the door saying that the proprietor would not be back . Disappointed , Mr. Crombie started the long climb back to Sunset Hill . The old house was empty . Mrs. Crombie had gone to some committee meeting . He took the letters into his study and sat down at his writing table . Opening the bills first , he placed them in an already bulging folder . An enormous fly buzzed senselessly as it attempted to escape through the window screen . Mr. Crombie raised the screen and brushed it out . He opened the letter from the Airy Breeze Summer Camp . A half-starved little lad was sitting on a curbstone hugging his bare knees dejectedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stinker and would n't cough up with a few dollars . All right . He was a stinker . He dropped the letter into the wastebasket and opened the envelope from Who 's Who . It contained a printed notice informing him that , because he was now retired , his biography was being placed in file for eventual insertion in an edition entitled Who Was Who and if he was already dead would his executors please notify the publishers promptly . It pointed up the fact as nothing else could have , at that particular moment , that there was something radically wrong with his life . If he was merely continuing to miss Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner , that was absurd . His business life was over . That part of him was in the past tense . He was a re/tired man , free to enjoy the rewards of his years of toil . The trouble was he did n't seem to want to enjoy them . Was it power that he missed ? No , there was something else . Something more subtle than power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current of life all around him . Compulsioncame into it somewhere . There had to be an " or else " element in life to give it seasoning ; a " survival " motivation . Was n't the sickness which seemed to be affecting the peoples of the world due to the efforts of the politicians , the labor leaders and the do-gooders to eliminate the " or else " element ? What was it Joe Beam had said ? " Being the kind of men we are , we lived the way we did and now we ca n't live any other way . " That was the truth . If only , as Joe had said , they could dream up something  --  some form of activity that would recreate at least a microcosm of their old life . The idea which he had originally passed over as a conversationalspark suddenly caught . His mind went back forty years to the day when he had discussed the formation of an investment-counselfirm with Hamilton and Gardiner . Both of them had been far more brilliant than he was in their respectivefields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But apparently he had had something else to contribute , some ingredient that was necessary to combine their talents into merchandise that the public wanted to buy . He put the unopened letter from the Middleburg real-estate agent into his shirt pocket . He wanted to think . It was too late and too hot to bother about lunch . Breaking out a tray of ice he made himself a Tom Collins and carried it out to the porch . A strange feeling of peace and contentment mixed with excitement seemed to flow through his veins . Perhaps he had put too much gin in his drink . He was sleeping when Mrs. Crombie arrived home shortly after five.  |p254HE  FOUND THE LETTER FROM THEreal-estate agent as he was preparing for bed . His first reaction was to throw it away unopened . Then his old training reasserteditself . Always open everything . You could never tell . " Dear Mr. Crombie : I have no idea , of course , whether Sunset Hill is for sale and I am aware of the fact that you bought it only a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing ventured , nothing gained , so I am venturingto bring to your attention a situation that may or may not be of interest to you . " A new Freshman Dean is taking office at Middleburg College in the fall . His name is Matthew Pratt . The Pratts do not want to live on top of the campus . ' They are young and have definite ideas how they want to bring up their three little girls . They want to find a place about ten or fifteen miles away and that puts Sunset Hill right in their range . " We passed your place yesterday while I was showing them the pathetically few things that are available . They fell in love with it and insisted that I write and ask whether , by any chance , you would be willing to sell . I told them what I thought you paid for the place and that you had put a great deal of money into it during the last year or so . That did not seem to faze them in the least and I judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want they will pay a good price for it.  | " Wo n't you give me a ring at your early convenience ? I would have come to see you but I had to go to New York . I will be in my office early Friday morning . " Mr. Crombie handed the letter to Jinny without comment . She was in bed , reading . " What 's this ? " " A letter . " " I had already guessed that . " She read the letter , then rereadit very slowly . Then she gave it back to him silently . She watched his face as he read it again . He placed it on his dresser and crossing the room , sat on the edge of her bed . For a few moments neither spoke , each seeking to read the answer in the other 's eyes . " You know . . . . " he said , finally , and paused . " What ? " He took her hand . " I do n't want to upset you , darling , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know that . You fell in with it because you thought that when I retired I was entitled to live the kind of life I wanted to live . You were a city girl . It took a lot of unselfishness to let the old apartment go and move into the wilderness and I appreciated it . I still do . " " Darling , I . . . " " Let me finish . We both fell in love with Sunset Hill the moment we set eyes on it . We 've both put a lot of effort into it and I 've watched you accept this life and become a part of it . You 've been much more successful at that than I have . You fit in better . Perhaps it 's because a woman does n't have the same pulls that a man does .

But this seems like such an unusual opportunity that I thought we ought to discuss it . This time I want to do what you want . I want to live the kind of life that you want to live . I ... " Her eyes filled with tears . She reached up and pulled him close to her . " Darling , " she said . " My very special darling . Do you think it 's too late to call up that damn real-estate man tonight ?

He often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had passed before they actually bought the property and of the additional months of hard work that had been necessary to put it into shape . And then , with a few pen strokes at the end of a legal document , it was gone . Why , after the expenditure of so much effort , had they agreed so eagerly to abandon it ? What was it that was drivingthem back to the City which he , at least , had always asserted was only a place for work and not for living ? What was this sense of inner excitement which was causing them both to approach the complicated reversal of all their plans with the enthusiasm of children ? And there was no question of its complexity . They were reverting to Scene One . To do so it was necessary to pick out the properties called for in that set and to dispose of those that were no longer necessary . The time had come when the two-of-everything formula must be liquidated . The voyage of the Ark was over.  |p260They  made a room-by-room inventory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this they chose the items that were to go to storage until a bigger apartment had been found ; and a bigger apartment was most certainly called for . If only they had n't sold the old one ! What was left over  --  well , it would have to be given to the children . " It breaks my heart to see all these expensive things that we bought only a few months ago being tossed out , " he said . " Is n't there any place . . . I mean , could n't we fit them in ? " " The answer to that is no , ' " she said firmly . " You do n't have to feel so badly about it . The kids need this stuff in the worst way . The thing to do is to think how happy we 're going to make them . " " It puts me all in a glow , " he said . " How are we ever going to decide who gets what ? " " Very simply , " said Mrs. Crombie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draw lots . " This seemed like a reasonable idea until it was discovered that the children were so trammeled-up in the webs of their frenzied lives that they could n't possibly tell what Sunday they might be able to come to Sunset Hill . The only thing they were agreed upon was that in all probability they could never agree on a common date . Most of them saw no reason for going through so much red tape about a simple thing . Let each one , they said , state what he or she wanted . That was all there was to it . Which might not have been so had they not all wanted the same things . Each conceded everything else to the others , in a big , magnanimousgesture . " I 've often wondered how people tear their hair , " Mrs. Crombie remarked . " This is obviously the place to find out as far as I 'm concerned . " " I 'd much rather send the whole ball of wax to an auction room and let them bid it in if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . "  |p261They  made typewritten lists of everything available and sent a copy to each child , asking that they mark their choices , bearing in mind that no one child could expect to receive all the important items . When the last schedule was in , the score remained unchanged . There followed long evenings of expensive telephone conversations during which it sometimes seemed that the foundations on which the Crombie family rested were being irretrievably shattered . " Listen , Dad . I 'm only an in-law . If Pat wants those things so badly then Dexter and I are going to drop out  --  I mean drop out entirely . Let her have them , for all we care . She raised the same ruckus about that portrait of Dexter 's grandfatherand we 're getting sick of it . " Or , " Dad , it 's your furniture , of course . You 've got a right to give it to anyone you choose , but do you realize that Linda and I have never had anything except those two worn-out old armchairs that nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Crombie after a long telephone conversation with Pat , " that we never have to give away anythingagain  --  ever  --  until we 're both dead . They can pull each other to pieces then , for all I care . " " I 'll tell you one thing they wo n't want , " said Mr. Crombie , trying to cheer her with a constructive thought . " That enormous , hideous samovar your mother brought us from Sweden years ago . It 's always been in the way , we 've never had a place for it and we certainly are n't going to lug it back to town . " " It is n't hideous , " she said . " It 's a lovely antique samovar . It has quite a history . Mother wrote it down for me . I think her letter is still in the samovar . But it is bulky , I 'll admit that . And I 'll also grant you that I 'm sick of polishing it . I wonder whom we might give it to . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . " " Now that you speak of it , when I was in Middleburgp262the other day I saw something called the Swedish-American Home . I remember it because Middleburg seemed such an unlikely place for homeless Swedes . Let me look in the phone book . " She returned in a few minutes . " I was right . It 's the Swedish-AmericanHome for the Aged . Why do n't I call them tomorrow ? " " Writing might be better . They 'll probably insist on half a dozen people approving everything they do . I 'll drop them a line . Maybe we can work out some kind of an income-tax deduction . " He wrote the following morning ; a long , persuasive letter describing the samovar as a rare antique and giving its history taken from his mother-in-law 's letter with embellishments . After a week had passed without receiving a reply he drove over to Middleburg and obtained a copy of the annual report of the Home . From this he learned the name of the Chairman of the Board of Trustees , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several interesting touches to add to the history . This letter was scarcely in the mail when Sam phoned . " Linda , " he said , " just remembered that wonderful old samovar that used to be in the linen closet in the old apartment . Linda 's grandmother was Swedish , you know , and so now the one thing she wants is that samovar . She says we 'll forgo all the rest of the giveaway if she could just have that . " Besides which , he added , they were both sick and tired of this interfamily bickering . It was getting on Linda 's nerves and interfering with her painting and the only thing that he and Linda had ever had . . . " ... was an old armchair that nobody wanted , " interruptedMr . Crombie . " How in the world did you remember that ? " asked Sam . ' Well , that 's the story anyway and that 's the way we feel . "  |p263Delighted  by this unexpected break , Mr. Crombie wrote a long , apologetic note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explaining the situation and withdrawinghis offer . He telephoned Sam at his office to tell him what he had done . Sam said he could n't be more pleased . He knew Linda would be equally delighted . Of course , in their tiny little house at Sneden 's Landing they had no room at the moment for a thing as big as the samovar . They were seriously considering an addition , however , and if this happened they would provide a suitable place for it without question . In the meanwhile they would just leave it where it was . " What 's the matter , dear ? You look depressed . " He slumped into the big wing chair . " It is n't a question of not wanting to dispose of things during your lifetime , " he said . " You ca n't dispose of them . " THE LAST MOVING VAN HAD LEFT . Mrs. Crombie was not there . She had gone to New York the day before , claiming a cold , but Mr. Crombie had a hunch that she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was as bare as the day he had first seen it , a little over a year before . Stripped of furniture it no longer seemed to belong to him . In some subtle way it had establishedan identity of its own . For a brief moment it belonged only to itself , remembering the generations that had occupiedp264it during the past 175 years , waiting for the generations yet to come , quiet , poised and utterly oblivious of this semistrangerwho had rested there for a moment like a migrating bird and was now on his way again . He took one last tour through the empty rooms . They seemed to regard him reproachfully . " Why did you fix us up with such loving ( and expensive ) care if you were going to walk out ? Why did you have that crazy old carpenter put shelves in your bedroom and build a toy closet in the attic ? Why did you spend a whole weekend trying to paper the walk-in closet ? Why , why , why ? " He hurried out the kitchen door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the western hills . It was that lovely amber time of day when all objects appear to grow larger and the countryside assumes a special blue-green lushness . He started to get into his car , then on an impulse he shut the door again and walked down the drive to the barn , where he took the little path that skirted its south end . From the back of the barn he had an unobstructed view of the dark tree masses that flanked the meadows in their descent to the valley . Far below he caught the glint of the river and on the farther side , already partly shadowed by the hills , the scattered buildings of a farm showed gray-white against the darkness of the trees . What had brought him to this place which he was now leaving ? Why had he sought it so persistently ? Was it an unconscious reaching back for something in his childhood which the turning pages of the years had covered up ? Spaciousold houses standing under forking elms ; the singing stillness of summer days ; wagons moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small heaps of dust ; the lazy intermittent whirr of hand-pushed lawn mowers , the importance of the seasons , of the winds , of the weather ; the enormous length of days . Were those the things he had been unconsciously seeking ?  |p265It  was a mistake to try to recapture the past . Thomas Wolfe wrote a whole book about that . The past existed only in one 's memory . Of course , it was true that certain of its physical aspects would still remain , but it was important to bear in mind that the eyes which had seen them originally , and the ears that had heard them , were gone forever and today 's eyes and ears would find them distressingly different . Far better to stick to the memory pictures . He was standing in the middle of the area where he had toiled so arduously during the last twelve months . In order to counteract the sentimental mood which he felt creeping over him like a sticky tide , he tried to conjure up all the distasteful things connected with this spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , the hours spent staggering about with logs for hungry fireplaces , the hopeless , unending struggle with encroaching nature . All these things were etched vividly in his mind and yet all he could see as he looked about him for the last time was beauty . Perhaps this was due to the fact that he was no longer responsible . Now that it was no longer his duty to eliminate them , the flaws had been absorbed into the whole and the whole was good . He walked to the car , got in and drove away without a backward glance.  |p266they  seemed to settle back into the life of the City . Mrs. Crombie had dropped effortlessly into her old routine of committees , lunches , shopping , bridge , telephones and people . It was rather a mystery to her what her husband did all day . She had anticipated difficulty when he was confronted for the first time , as a retired man , with the hyperthyroid life of New York . He had apparently found something to keep him busy , however , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It puzzled her , but , following their established custom , she asked no questions . He seemed happy . Let that suffice . When he was ready he would talk . " You look as if you 'd swallowed a covey of canaries , or a bevy , or however canaries come , " she said as they sat down to dinner one evening in late September . " Come clean , darling . Has some moppet told you she understands you ? " " I was saving it till I had plenty of time for all the gory details , " he replied . " All right , this is as good a time as any . Let me begin at the end and work back to the beginning . Joe Beam and Henry Buckley and I are going into business to-gether . " She placed her soupspoon overcarefully on the saucer and stared at him incredulously . " You 're what ? " " We 're going into business . We 've formed a little company . At least we 're going to form one if the lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what doing , dear ? What doing ? " Her expression was one of such genuine astonishment that his voice became almost apologetic . " It 's nothing big . Do n't worry . We 're not going off the deep end . It just so happens , though , that between the three of us we know a lot of corporationexecutives in this country and we know quite a lot about their businesses and what makes them tick , or not tick , as the case may be . " A few weeks ago Joe had an idea about bringing two companies together and when that fellow has an idea he usually starts working on it . Well , to his surprise the idea began to jell almost immediately and when he told me about it at Sunset Hill that gave me an idea : Here was a piece of business just begging for a company to take care of it . Here were Joe Beam and Henry Buckley and myself just begging for a company to take care of us . I got hold of both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural . Joe and Henry are both experts in their different fields and they complementeach other beautifully  --  a wonderful team  --  and I , oh I guess they 're just taking me along for the ride . " At any rate , they leaped at the idea like a couple of trout . I think it had been rattling around in all of our minds since that weekend at Sunset Hill . It was this piece of business of Joe 's , though , that brought it into focus  --  made it seem practical . " And then , do you know what happened right on top of all that ? Miss Parkinson came back from her cruise . You rememberthey retired her six months ago and she blew herself to a trip around the world . She called me up and asked me how I liked retirement . I told her I was n't retired any more and neither was she  --  she was the senior , and at the moment the only , secretary of the about-to-be-born firm of Crombie , Beam and Buckley . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , naturally , " he said , surprised.  | " But why in the world did n't you tell me about all this ? Why did you keep it a secret ? " " I did n't want to tell you until we were all set . I was afraid you might persuade me not to . Do you think we 're crazy ? " He looked at her anxiously , seeking her approval . She rose from her chair and coming around the table , threw her arms around his neck . " I was never so happy in my life , " she said . " That 's how crazy I think you are . Now I 've covered you with lipstick . Go get a paper handkerchief and then tell me all about it . " When he resumed his seat at the table he looked like a small boy who suddenly finds himself praised when he had expected a scolding . " Do you realize , " he said , " that I will have a regular office again ; a place where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for me every morning and where I can answer it that clay instead of worrying about it for a week . " The eagerness in his voice would have told her the story even if she had not known it already ; the yearning for some place where he belonged , some place where he would be surrounded by the old familiar atmosphere of controlled confusion , some place where he would sense again the feeling of pressure which would indicate that he was once more an integral part of a busy world . He told her more of the details . Joe Beam 's merger negotiationwould be their first piece of business . After that  --  well , after that they would undoubtedly dig up other similar situations . They wanted to keep themselves free , however , to tackle anything that came along which appealed to them and which they thought they were capable of handling . They were sure that other things would turn up . In fact , their difficulty might be to keep the show small , if one could judge by the reception that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Midwest for the purpose of spreading the news.  |p269As  he talked , her mind went back once again to the night when he had told her that he was leaving the Guaranty and forming the firm of Crombie , Hamilton and Gardiner . Now he was doing it all over again . The same pattern . The same judgment of men . The same sense of timing . Old leopards never changed . As ONE MOVED THROUGH THEstreets of mid-Manhattan , in whatever direction , the eye pierced the skeletons of giant buildings in process of construction . No matter where you went you remained within a colossal ring of mounting steel and concrete , a tiny dot in the center of a fantastic arena . On Third Avenue , on Second Avenue , on the connecting side streets , on every important corner , huge top-heavy cranes hoisted steel beams on threadlike cables over the unheeding heads of passers-by . Mountains of brick and sand blocked the all but impassable streets as office buildings and apartments rose phoenix-like from the acrid dust of demolishedbrownstones . The whole face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busses , unable to spot familiar landmarks , got off at the wrong corners and motorists from the suburbs held up the profane traffic trying to read the street numbers . Where did all these businesses come from which moved into these new glass temples almost before they **26;3246;TOOLONG of them were specialists at saving money  --  of necessity on their salaries , although Levin felt one or two went above and beyond the call of duty . Dave Fitznogle could quote from memory the latest Consumer Reports ratings on anything from baby diapers to Piper Cubs . John Cutler , another upstairs man , was fanatic about auctions . He attended those in Marathon on Tuesday nights and bought things at bargain prices . One night he bid a dollar for a case of corn flakes and to his surprise , got it . Cutler could n't stand cold cereal so he gave boxes of it away to colleagues and neighbors . Thanks to his generosity Levin enjoyed two weeks of inexpensive breakfasts . During the fall the men in the coffee room talked about flying saucers , five percenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hunting , fishing , their army experiences , and the graduate school ratrace . There was talk about the weather ; they congratulated themselves on its mildness . Although books were mentioned they were rarely discussed , and Levin continued to confide his thoughts of what he had read to his notebook . At ten and three , when Professor Fairchild appeared in the coffee room , there was standing room only . The old man , his cup in hand  --  he never seemed to drink  --  discoursedhumorously on politics . His subject usually was creepingsocialism , where it crept , the tyranny of the New Deal , which Easchester had four times voted against , and the evils of federal aid to education . No one questioned his argument or contradicted his facts . Even after he left , controversy did not begin . If there was a mild discussion it ended in agreement . The men or the times ? Levin wondered . He had been told there had been " some hot arguments " when Duffy was around . If there was no visible fear in the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence or vacuum he did not inquire into . He was afraid to . Gerald Gilley often sat alone in the coffee room . Levin , on his way to Milly 's office or the water cooler , saw him on the bench , long legs comfortably crossed , his finger on the loop ofp101a half-empty coffee mug dangling down his knee , eyes reflectivelylit ; or the cup full and thoughtfully rising to his puckeredlips . Seeing the instructor going by , Gilley would lift his arm in greeting ; most often he seemed not to know who was passing , involved with his coffee , the sipping so satisfying he smiled as if the brew were bewitched to some useful purpose . Levin envied him his particular cupful , the same brand he tried at night when he had a set or two of themes to knock off before tomorrow , only it did n't jazz up his dreams . If Gerald , examining the interior of his coffee mug , saw a vision of the future , it seemed to please him . He was , as director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving Levin things , ordered for him a Webster 's dictionary , S. LEVIN lettered in gold on the cover , brought in a flowered fin wastebasket , desk calendar , red-ink ballpoint pen , handy for grading ; and he predicted the arrival of a foam rubber backrest for the instructor 's chair , and a replacement , soon , of the cracked window that split the campus scene . " You 're too kind , " Levin said humbly , and Gilley blew his nose . It could truthfully be said he did n't know who next to give what . Levin wondered what the secret of his good nature was  --  constitution ? the woman he had married ? Maybe it was the years he had lived in small towns , his nervous systemprotected from city pressures , city grind ? Maybe a combinationof these things ? Levin was curious about Gerald 's experience  --  his life seemed to have gone along evenly  --  and he wondered if he had ever been ecstatic or miserable . And with wondering Levin wished him continued good fortune . One morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean tea ? We could go across the street to the Student Union for a change ? " " Thanks , Gerald , I just had my cup . " He nodded at the mug on his desk . Gilley shut the door quietly and sat in the visitor 's chair . " I 've been thinking we could drive out to the coast tomorrow , if you 're agreeable , and do some salmon fishing . There 's a riverp102I fish that gives up some good catches on eggs and flashbait . The fish are beginning to color  --  they get bruised up by this time of the year , but they 're still in good condition . I 've more than once taken Chinooks out of the water weighing thirty or forty pounds . What I do is bring my outboard motor and rent a boat . There 'll be plenty of room for you , George , and me . I could lend you a spinner and a couple of lures . The regular license is five dollars but maybe we could get you a one-shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . I have n't seen a warden all year . " " If we went I 'd better pay , " Levin said . " I get socked when I try to get away with something . " He thanked him for the invitation . " I would like to go , Gerald , but frankly , I happen to be loaded down with papers just this week . Maybe we could make it some other time ? " " Sure , " said Gilley , " we 'll do it in the spring . " He did n't seem too disappointed . Still it was nice of him to ask , Levin thought . Gilley looked absently out of the cracked window , then at Levin . " How 's it been coming , Sy ? Your work and all that ? Do you like it here ? " Levin said he did . " Good deal . " Gerald after a minute asked , " I was wondering if you had heard of Professor Fairchild 's impending retirement next sum-mer ? " " Only that and no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's known all over the state . Still , " he said , " there 's a lot to be done in the department . " He had lowered his voice . " He 's a little on the old-fashioned side and that 's hindered us a bit . I say this loyally , you understand ? " " Yes , of course . " Levin felt his throat tighten . " I hear the new dean has a change or two in mind for us . The right sort of thing , I hope , because change just to changep103is senseless . " He sounded moody . " Would n't you agree with that ? " " Sure , " said Levin . Gilley brightened . " If I were head here there are a few things I 'd be inclined to start off with . First , I 'd ask for at least five additional positions . Comp , as you know , is running thirty to a class , about five too many , ideally ten , but who has money for the ideal ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty . If I could bring them down to thirty  --  thirty-five , we might have some class discussions instead of concentrating on lecturing . This is confidential , Sy , but Orville 's a little tight on budget matters . He prides himself on keeping costs down , and I 'm for that myself , a hundred percent , but with a little more depth on the bench we 'd be a better department . " Excited , Levin thought . This is his vision . " Would you agree with that ? " " Certainly . " The director of composition wet his lips almost invisibly . " If you happen to have any suggestions of your own for improving anything I 'd be happy to hear them . " Good of him , Levin thought , but I 'd better lay off . " I 'm really serious about that , " Gilley said . " In that case , " Levin said with a thick tongue , " maybe I ought to say I think English io is a good place to begin teachingwriting . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshmen think a paragraph is a new invention . And I 'm not against grammar but I 'm against  --  I do n't care for only grammar . For the boneheads it 's torture . " " Bonehead is bonehead , Sy , " said Gerald . " That 's why they 're there , to get the drill they did n't get before . As for paragraphing in English io , that 's an idea , but some of the men would shoot anyone who suggested more paper work in that course . " " The continuous workbook stuff is deadening . " " You 've got your reader . " " We could stand one for the bonehead course , somethingp104with a little variety to it . I respect science and technology but it 's not enough for growing boys and girls . " Gerald smiled . " I 'll say this , I 've thought of some of the things you 're talking about , but frankly , Orville swears by the course as it 's given . Still and all , whatever ideas you have for improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time comes . I like suggestions given in a friendly spirit by people who are aware of what the practical problems are and how long it took to build Rome . " Levin decided he had said all he was going to . He stroked his beard , twice yawning . " Anyway , " Gerald said , " I have no doubt that we see eye to eye on the important things . " Levin nodded . " And I can count on your support ? " The instructor left off pacifying his whiskers . " Support ? " " What I have in mind , " Gerald said , " is that I would like us all to work in harmony after Orville retires , to make this the kind of department it ought to be . " " I 'm for that , " said Levin . " Good . " Gerald extended his hand and Levin took it . " Every man counts . " The instructor , without knowing why , blushed . Gilley , looking at his shoe , then at the mountains in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be some sort of contest between Fabrikant and me for the department headship ? Have you talked to him yet ? " " A little , is about all I can say . " " He 's a Harvard graduate and all that , good scholar but stiff as a board . I have seniority over him and I think Orville would like me in after him . That 's just between us , please . It 's not favoritism either . Years ago Orville offered CD the directorship of composition but he turned it down , so I got it . I 've been doing the dirty work while CD has sat behind a locked door , writing his literary papers . That 's why Orville favors me . " " In that case , why worry ? "  | " I 'm really not , but we do have this new dean and , frankly , people in power are just plain unpredictable . If he starts callingdepartment members into his office to consult them about a choice , I want them to know what I stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone . Pauline does n't like it either . " Levin shrugged . " Practical politics . " " I 'm glad you understand , Sy . " Gilley was getting up but sat down . " By the way , would you want a phone of your own put in here so you wo n't have to be running to Milly 's office when she buzzes ? I got George one two years ago . " " Who would I call ? " Levin asked . " That reminds me , " Gilley said . " Pauline has been talking about having you over but there 's been a million things and the kids already have colds . Erik starts off hacking and then little Mary picks it up . " " Spsssh , " said Levin . " Plenty of time . " " I just want you to know we 've been keeping you in mind . Pauline finds it a little hard to get started entertaining after the summer . She says the town is over-organized  --  just too many things for everybody to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been begging her to cut down . Tires her out . She 's on the Library Committee , the Community Chest , and the Women Voters  --  they 're trying to do something about the sewage and she goes to more damn meetings till all hours . I try to get her to ease up but she says it 's all worth while , so she wears herself out . We 've been a little snowed under but we expect to see more of our friends soon . " Levin thanked him . Gilley got up . " One last thing . One of the textbook salesmen is after me to do a freshman reader . Would you care to lend a hand ? It 'd be mostly finding suitable articles and writing up a few questions and notes . After paying off contributors we could expect a yearly five or six hundred apiece for about half a dozen years . After that we could revise without too muchp106trouble and the thing could go on and on . Nobody gets rich  --  Orville 's sales are unusual , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks , again , " Levin said , blowing his nose . " Maybe sometime , but you know how it is on a new job . You have to work at it for a while before you have any spare time on hand . " Gilley grinned . " I think you work too g.d . hard , Sy . You ought to have more fun . I 'm getting worried about you . " Levin , on the verge of cracked laughter , peremptorily cut it out . Over the week-end , in blasts of wind and rain , the walnuts began to fall in the backyard , plopping down on dead leaves and sopping grass . When Levin saw what was happening he ran out with Mrs. Beaty 's big aluminum pot to collect them . The nuts were large , their shells glowing orange when they fell from the broken pods . He greedily cracked one open and tried eating it but the meat was rubbery . When he brought the loaded pot into the kitchen , the landlady set aside those with broken shells and scrubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put up an old window screen , on pipes above the furnace , for the walnuts to dry out on . All day Levin went often to his window and when he saw any nuts on the ground , ran down the stairs with the pot . In bed , for hours he heard the nuts socking the wet earth in the dark . At dawn he quickly gathered them up , not at peace until all the walnuts were in and drying , and the tree was bare . Leaves fell in the rain in droves , multitudes , refugee millions  --  maple , oak , chestnut , walnut , pear , cherry , mountain ash , and the large alien sycamore leaves from across the street ; like a soggy blanket they covered gutter , sidewalk , lawn , backyard , bushes and alley . Levin resisted raking them until he could no longer stand his resistance . One afternoon after class he began to work . He raked first the front lawn , then the sidewalk and swept it clean , carrying wet bunches of dripping leaves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrub=p107and handpicked the bushes clean . Although it was soon dark and he was tired he continued to gather leaves . By the light of the street lamp he scraped up those along the curb , and then in the light from Mrs. Beaty 's kitchen window , raked the backyard . He raked wearily , without thought , both palms blistered , arms and back aching . The landlady , through her window , begged him to stop but Levin raked to destroy all dead leaves . He went on in a misty drizzle , stacking the backyardleaves on the mulch pile behind the garage . When he was through , at an unknown hour , the grounds around the house were neat and clean yet he regretted not having got at the leaves in the gutter . The instructor was thinking of going to Gilley to make it clear to him that he was n't committing himself to anyone for head of department until he knew more than he did about both candidates . Instead , on impulse late one afternoon , Levin knocked on Dr. Fabrikant 's door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall more than once , his white socks visible as he walked , his bachelorhood unyielding , they had not talked since the time Levin had visited his farm . He was in , Levin heard him cough . He waited until something that sounded like a bolt was withdrawn . Fabrikant stared out at him . " Excuse me , I  --  " But the scholar held the door open . " Come in . " Off his horse he looked less formidable . And he turned out to be , without a hat , bald , yet in need of a haircut around the pelted head . His office , as Levin had expected , was overrun by books , including loose-paged piles on the window sill , radiator , and spare desk in the corner of the room . On his desk he had laid out rows of note cards , thickly scribbled ; these ran onto the floor . Levin , envying work in progress , would have liked to know what the scholar was doing , but he had heard from Bucket that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paraphernalia on his desk , Fabrikantp108located a cigar butt , lit up , shaking the match out over his head , then pointed with the smoking stick to a chair . Levin , after stepping gingerly over the cards , removed half a dozen books from the chair and seated himself . " I would hate to interrupt something important . " Fabrikant puffed his cigar butt without comment . " How are you coming along ? " " I ca n't complain . " " I can and do . " The scholar laughed his two syllable laugh . " Do you like the West ? " " Yes , I do . Everybody 's friendly . " Fabrikant , regarding him , grunted . " I would n't live in the East again if they offered me the mint . I 've often thought if the capital of the United States were located out here we 'd have a lot more sanity in our national life . " " I left New York on my own accord  --  " " It was sensible . " "  --  seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This corner of the country was come upon by explorers searching for the mythical Northwest Passage , " Fabrikant said , " and it was opened by traders and trappers in their canoes trying to find the Great River of the West , the second Mississippithey had heard of . Then the settlers came , fighting the Indians , clearing the land , and building their homes out of their guts and bone . " " Marvelous , " Levin murmured . " ' There were giants in those days , ' " Fabrikant said moodily . " Their descendants are playing a defensive game . Their great fear is that tomorrow will be different from today . I 've never seen so many pygmies in my life . " " That 's very interesting , " said Levin . " It reminds me what you said last time : that if I was a liberal I might be called on to prove it . Those were your words and would you care to elaborate a little ? " Though his butt had gone out , Fabrikant still puffed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind he began to search for an exit . " Did I say that ? " " Something of that nature . " " I was annoyed . Frankly , I did n't like the circumstances of your hiring . " " Me ? " Levin had partially risen . " Yes , " said Fabrikant . " The arrangement is for the three senior members of the department  --  Fairchild , I , Gilley  --  to look over applications for positions and make a choice . I wrested this morsel of democratic procedure , together with a course or two , out of them some years ago , but in your case my approval was omitted . " " I 'm very sorry . " " It 's true that there was an emergency when the man we had hired in the spring reneged in summer and a new selectionhad to be made in a hurry . Fairchild was in Walla Walla at his daughter 's , and Gilley , without consulting me , acted on his own . He later contended he had tried to get me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to that was he ought to have driven over to the farm , because he knew my sister was in the hospital with her sciatica and I am usually on the premises . He did n't bother and made the selection alone . He hired you . " " Ah  --  I 'm sorry . " " No fault of yours . " Levin felt low . Once in his life he hoped to be somebody 's unchallenged first choice . " After talking to you , " Fabrikant said , " I was satisfied Gilley had blundered into a suitable appointment . Nevertheless , I have to insist on the few prerogatives I have here . " " I understand , " Levin said . " What I was referring to before is that since there seems to be a contest of some kind developing , I thought I ought to inform myself what your ideas are for running the department , if I may ask . " Fabrikant was deathly silent.  |p110My  God , have I jumped the gun again ? Levin asked himself . " I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " said Fabrikant , " but I 'll answer only if it 's understood I 'm not politicking . I do n't care for that . " " Of course . " " If I become head of this department , " Fabrikant said , " I 'll change plenty . " He gazed gloomily at the book-lined wall . " But this is all premature . I do n't know that I 'm even remotely considered as a possibility . There 's been talk that the new dean may want  --  but that could be no more than rumor . At any rate whoever they may or may not have in mind for the job , I 'll say without false modesty that I am at all odds the logical choice . They ca n't match my educational background , nor my research and publications , granted that they mean something in this institution , which I wo n't grant . " " I have heard that you were being considered  --  " " Possibly . This is strictly confidential , but the administration has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one unpopular cause in the past . " " Like Duffy , for instance ? " Fabrikant grimaced . " Let 's forget him . " " Excuse me  --  " " I 've been too independent for them . I have n't made friends or influenced people . Gilley has made a career of that . He 's always washed Fairchild 's dirty drawers so the old man could be free to potter with his textbook . Such devotion is not for nothing . " " Does Mrs. Gilley approve of that ? " " I have no interest in Mrs. Gilley , " Fabrikant said . " Since you 've brought this matter up I 'll tell you what I would try to accomplish in the department . First of all I 'd ask this new dean to do something drastic about salaries . Fairchild is stingy , so was Dean Feeney , a conjunction of two constipated stars in the same constellation . For years they kept us dancing in our bare bones ; as a result , this department is the lowest paid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he employs human beings , Labhart might have done something more than throw the poor dog a bone . " " Tst-tst . " " Before I brought it to a stop Fairchild was n't spending the pittance we were allowed for a library allotment and was turningpart of the money back to Dean Feeney , who assigned it to those departments who were overdrawn on theirs . " " That 's too bad  --  " Fabrikant drew on his dead cigar . " By the way , what are we paying you ? " " Me ? Three thousand a year . " " That 's scandalous . You should be getting thirty-five hundred , at least . " " Without college teaching experience ? I taught for two years in a high school . " " Even so you 're ridiculously underpaid . " " Dr. Gilley said he would have given me more if I were married . " " What 's that got to do with your ability to perform your task ? I 'm not married and proud of it . " " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few good men here , most of whom I 've insisted ought to be hired , but their efforts are frustrated by those who came to teaching to hide their ignorance . I 'll name no names . I 'd throw them out if I could and bury the rest in composition . " " Could I ask what you 'd do in composition  --  to improve it ? " " I 'd throw out The Elements . " Levin gulped . " He 's got stinking rich out of that atrocity . " " Er  --  What is your position on the liberal arts issue ? Would you try to bring back English majors ? " " One could n't unilaterally , " Fabrikant said . " That 's a political football and would have to be worked out with our idealistic friends at Gettysburg . Of course I 'd plug for the return of the whole liberal arts program , but keep in mind that this situationp112has existed for thirty years and nothing 's going to change it overnight . I do n't think the majority of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But some are ? " " Very few and that includes those in our own division . They 've lived in the graveyard so long I doubt they 'll ever come back to life . I 'm frankly pessimistic and do n't foresee any change in the situation during my lifetime . It takes fifty years to grow a tree and that sort of thing influences people 's ideas around here . " " Should n't we start propagandizing  --  working , that is , for the idea , to recover what we once had ? With the right leader we " There 's only one leader at Cascadia College and that 's Marion Labhart . What he wants is what we get . " " Could n't it be suggested to him ?  --  " " It has been , but it wo n't do any good until he falls over it himself . One has to be careful with that type . " Levin imagined the scholar had n't been . Fabrikant dropped the cigar stub into the wastebasket and rose . So did Levin . The scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without iris . " I 'll have to caution you again to be discreet about our talk . In my position a man has to think along more than one track . If Gilley should be chosen over me I 'd still have to live with him . " " I wo n't say a word . " Levin stepped over the note cards on the floor . " Thanks , I 've  --  ah  --  learned a lot . " Fabrikant lifted his shoe to strike a match , then realized he had discarded the cigar butt . He shook out the match and tossed it into the wastebasket . In afterthought he poured half a glass of water into the basket . Levin had the door open but shut it . " Do you happen to know how much Mr. Duffy was paid ? " " Thirty-seven hundred . " " I guess he had more experience ? "  | " He had never taught before . " " You do n't say ? Er  --  Would you know any special reason or circumstance why I was chosen over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who was willing to take three thou-sand ? " " As I told you , Gilley did n't consult me . " " Thanks anyway . " Levin left . A minute later he was back . " Sorry to bother you again . This popped into my head but I forgot to ask you . They 're showing a good film downtown tonight and I wondered if you 'd be interested in seeing it ? We could have some coffee after  --  that is , if the idea appeals to you ? " " Thank you , no , " Fabrikant said . " I do n't go to the movies , too darn much sex . " Levin guffawed . The instructor had discovered a rich night life on the second floor of Humanities Hall . He found not only Bucket at his lamplit desk  --  door wide open for he felt it unnatural to work in silence after living with five kids  --  but also George Bullock , usually with a half dozen six-footers sitting around his desk ; and Avis Fliss typing or mimeographing objective tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilley popped in once in a while , and it was rumored Merdith Schultz also came in but no one tried to prove it . Levin had several times spoken with Bucket , but only in passing , for the assistant professor was one of the few genuinelybusy men in the department . When not in class he had one or more students in his office , who came early and stayed late . At night Bucket banged away in a fast hunt-and-peck on the latest revision of his dissertation . He worked in the same cement-stained levis Levin had seen him in on the roof , and in socks , his army shoes on the floor . Since he was always so busy Levin preferred not to bother him , but one rainy night in early November , shortly after his talk with Fabrikant , afterp114twice wandering past Bucket 's open door without attracting his attention , the instructor knocked on the jamb . Bucket hastily covered the papers on his desk with a folder and swiveled to face his visitor . " Could I see you for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I wo n't stay long . I know what your time means to you . " Bucket cackled . " I 've meant to visit with you but you know my situation . " " Tst , " said Levin . " It could be worse . " " I admire your patience . " " T is known by the name of perseverance in a good cause ,  --  and of obstinacy in a bad . " ' " Sterne ? " " Touche . " Leaning back in his chair Bucket rested his shoeless feet on the desk . Ile reconsidered and withdrew them . Levin sat with his handkerchief in his hands . Bucket glanced covertly at the typewriter but waited patiently . Levin sighed . " I 've been teaching here five weeks , half the term , without a feeling I 'm accomplishing much . I 'm up to par , " he went on quickly , " according to the syllabus , but short on satisfaction . Maybe you can advise me ? " Bucket glanced out into the hall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door but saw no one . " If you 'll pardon me for saying so , I 'm so busy with The Elements , trying to cover what I have to for the departmental objective , that there 's very little time for much else . " Bucket nodded . " The themes I 've been getting are short on ideas , and I 've had to take time off in self-defense , though the syllabus does n't call for it , to teach how to organize and develop a topic . I know they 're supposed to know  --  "  |p115Bucket  nodded . " Er  --  The Science in Tech essays , when we do get to them are something less than inspiring , for which I blame not the subject but the selection . I blamed myself until I read them again . Believe me , I can understand why Duffy ordered outsidereadings . " Bucket , poking his head into the hall , quietly shut the door . In afterthought he snapped the lock . Stepping into his shoes , he polished his glasses and sat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Levin said , " I sometimes feel I 'm engaged in a great irrelevancy , teaching people how to write who do n't know what to write . I can give them subjects but not subject matter . I worry I 'm not teaching how to keep civilization from destroying itself . " The instructor laughed embarrassedly . " Imagine that , Bucket , I know it sounds ridiculous , pretentious . I 'm not particularly gifted  --  ordinary if the truth be told  --  with a not very talented intellect , and how much good would I do , if any ? Still , I have the strongest urge to say they must understand what humanism means or they wo n't know when freedom no longer exists . And that they must either be the best  --  masters of ideas and of themselves  --  or choose the best to lead them ; in either case democracy wins . I have the strongest compulsion to be involved with such thoughts in the classroom , if you know what I mean . " " I do , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be teachingcomposition ? " " That 's what I tell myself but it does n't help much . " " Take my advice and do n't introduce any extraneous text into the course without Professor Fairchild 's express permis-sion . " Someone knocked on the door . When Levin realized he was looking for a place to hide , he composed himself by smoothing his beard . Bucket , after a quick glance around , got up and turned the lock . George Bullock was standing in the hall , blinking at thep116light , his hat and trench coat soaked . His sharp nose and narrow cleft chin inclined him to hatchet-faced . " Raining , " he said . " So ? " said Bucket . " I heard voices . Thought Gerald might be here . " His glance fell on Levin . " Sorry , " Bullock said to Bucket . Bucket shut the door , he seemed uneasy . " Was he listening ? " Levin asked . " Sh . " The assistant professor kept his ear to the door until they heard footsteps going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Levin asked . " That 's a difficult question . " " Excuse me for asking . " " We 're not friendly , a case of mutual disapprobation . " He put his ear to the door again , then sat down . " What does he do here at night ? " " He tutors athletes twice a week . " " Athletes ? " " Bullock seems genuinely concerned about them as underprivilegedpeople . Sometimes he has more than a half dozen a night who are having trouble in composition or literature , or both . " " Is that an assignment ? " " As I understand it , no official source has commissioned this particular occupation . Bullock apparently thought up the idea on his own and no one opposes it . At first it was a completelyvoluntary , and , I suppose , generous act on his part , but then the Physical Education department heard about it and insisted on paying for his services . I 've heard no complaintsabout it . I understand that Leroy Davis and someone else from upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's request , to help . He 's a popular figure with the athletes . Last Christmas Eve the football and basketball squads serenaded him and Jeannette on their front lawn . They held white candles and sang carols . "  | " Why would a Ph.D . in English be so interested in athletes ? " " The breed has infinite varieties . " Bucket cackled . " Is that sort of thing cricket ? " " Some say no . " " Er  --  Should n't something be done about it ? " " Possibly  --  under the right circumstances . " Levin pondered his remark . " You mean if the right person gets to be head ? " " I 'll say no more . " " I 'll go now . " " You need n't rush . " " I 've wasted your evening . " Bucket denied it . " I 'll be revising this accursed paper for-ever . " " Then one more question : I 've lately talked to Fabrikant and Gilley  --  I 've heard that either one or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's sure , but both very conscious of the limitations of whatever powers they might have in the future  --  in other words , what they can hope to accomplish here . I 'm a little more favorable to Fabrikant , I like his point of view , but I like Gerald too , as a person . I have no illusions that my support , or the lack of it , will mean anything much to either of them but just so that I know what I 'm doing , who 's the better man if you do n't mind saying ? " Levin put away his handkerchief and Bucket pulled his out and mopped his brow . He said in a low voice , " My own considered preference is for CD over Gerald . " " Aha . " " That of course is strictly confidential . " " Of course . " " Gerald , in his way , can be an efficient administrator . He may someday be dean of something or other , but CD , in my opinion , is more truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective in raising our standards . Although I agree with your observation that there 'll bep118few daring innovations under either man , yet what comes with CD will come with increasing value . " " I did n't mean  --  " " When I say raising our standards , ' " Bucket hurried on , " I speak without disrespect for Professor Fairchild , an old and much-liked teacher of mine . I 've often thought it a shame that he did not devote himself entirely to teaching . I 'll testify he does it well . " " Does Fabrikant have a chance at the job ? " " Your guess is equal to mine . I understand the situation is fluid . No one I know quite understands the preference of the new dean in all this . One hears all sorts of rumors . " " Is Gilley at all liberal ? His wife sounds as though she might be . " " I would n't judge him by her . " " He was dead set against Duffy ? " Levin asked , one hand investigating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabrikant defended him ? " " At the outset . " " Something happened between them ? Was it some sort of fight ? " " I do n't think I 'd care to go into that " " Were they ever friends ? " Levin asked . " I believe they respected each other but that 's as far as it went . They were both very independent people and tended not to attract one another . " Having said that , Bucket stepped out of his shoes . " I 'm leaving now , " Levin said , " after this : When Fabrikant dropped Duffy 's defense in the AAP , was n't there anyone else to take it up ? " " He had become universally unpopular . " " Was he , with you ? " " I personally liked him , though I ca n't say I liked everything he did . " Levin rose at last . " Thanks for your time . "  | " Think nothing of it . I rely on your discretion . " He said it with an inquiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried grading papers but could not keep his mind on it and left the office . Downstairs he waited on the porch for the pouring rain to let up , thinking of his talk with Bucket . Whatever 's happening here , he thought , I 'd better not get involved . The door behind him opened , George Bullock . " Want a ride ? " Levin looked at the night . " Thanks . " " Wait 'll I get the wagon , " Bullock said . " No use both of us drowning . " In a few minutes he drew up to the curb in a mauve station wagon and Levin ran down the steps and ducked in . He noticed at once a whiskey odor , and Bullock , as if sensing it , lit a cigarette . He was an intense man and drove with his head thrust forward , his sharp face like a ship 's prow directed against the saturated night . " I 'll take the Bay Area winter fog to this soup anytime . " " Is that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee room you hadrecently turned down an offer from a college in Frisco . " " Nobody but Easterners say Frisco . " " Excuse me , San Francisco . " " Your information was correct . My wife loves her mother . I figure better us alone in Cascadia dew than mama living with us in the California sunshine . " " Aha , " said Levin . " Now that we 're sharing confessions , and without meaning to be personal , I did n't know you were palsy walsy with Bucket . " " Er  --  Should n't I be ? " " Who said so ? I have nothing against the guy even if he does talk like the New York Times , but what makes me un/comfortable is the futility he gives off . Of all the people to write about : Laurence Sterne : a long digression . ' " " What 's wrong with Sterne ? " " That immoral twerp . " " You do n't say ? " " Have you read Thackeray on him ? " " No . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What were you two boys doing with your heads together ? I bet Bucket played up CD Fabrikant for head of department ? " " His name was mentioned , " the instructor said warily . " Bucket overrates him , take my word . CD is a fair-enough scholar but starched like my granddaddy 's collar . " " I hear he 's had a hard life ? " " Who has n't . " " You 've had ? " Levin asked . " At fourteen I was crippled by polio . The doctor said I would never walk again . " " Tst-tst . " " So much for medical science . In college I ran a hundred yards in eleven seconds . " " Wonderful , " Levin murmured . " Have you read any of his stuff ? " Bullock asked . " Fabrikant 's ? " " Yes . " " I expect to . " " Be sure to go over it with a vacuum cleaner . " " It 's dusty ? " " You 'll die sneezing . " " No good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . " " Ah , too bad , " said Levin . " I like the thought of having a good scholar in the department . " " Goddam , imagine bibliographing Civil War fiction . " Bullocksnickered . " Is that what he 's doing ? "  | " That 's what he told Avis . She drops in to see *him every once in a while and he looks at her legs . That 's the only time he keeps his office door open , to show he 's not seducing her . What kind of head of department would he make if you have to get to him with a crowbar ? " " More important , " said Levin , " is does he have qualities of leadership ? " " Who leads behind a locked door ?  --  unless it 's Casanova , which he 's not . " " Sometimes the door opens and out comes a man with a sword . " " If you think so he 's your baby . " " I 've heard some of the men speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they know Gerald is the better choice . He gets along with everybody , and do n't think that 's so easy . He plays pinochle with Labhart and they golf together . When the chips are down I 'll bet lox to bagels that Gerald will get more for the department than CD ever could with his history of antagonizing the administration . " " Are you referring to the Duffy case ? " " No , that time he was safe on base . " " When he dropped the AAP defense ? " " Yes . " " " Would you happen to know why he did ? " " Did n't Bucket tell you ? " " No . " " Maybe Duffy pissed on one of Fabrikant 's Persian melons . Or the old boy finally discovered what everybody else knew all along , that Leo was a fake . Up to then they had a sneaking admiration for each other as members of the maverick 's union . What Fabrikant liked about Duffy was he did what he did n't dare to . Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his head . CD is a Milquetoast Quixote . " As they turned onto Levin 's street , Bullock said , " I 'll tell you what let 's do . Let 's shoot over to my joint and see how muchp122comes out of the rum bottle when we squeeze . Jeannette 's a sociable girl and would be happy to have you . " " Thanks , " said Levin , " but I 'm behind in themes . " Yet when the station wagon stopped in front of Mrs. Beaty 's house , he lingered . " What I do n't understand , " Levin said , " is why everybody is choosing sides . Will our advice be so important to whoever makes the choice ? " Bullock shot his cigarette out of a window he had lowered . " It was an appointive job at one time but may not be now . Gerald was a shoo-in until they dug up Seagram from the cornfields of Iowa . This former buddy of mine who teaches where he did , wrote me the dean had done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  departmental elections . Charlie says he 's bugs on the subject . Well , whatever the method is , appointive or elective , I have my dough on Gerald . He 's the logical choice . " " An election ? " Levin felt excitement . " Nobody knows for sure , but nobody 's taking chances . " He winked in the glass . " Realpolitik . " The instructor , with the door half open , had another thought . " Ah  --  when did Gerald first get wind there might be an elec-tion ? " " I told him last spring after I heard from Charlie that Seagramwas coming here . Why ? " Levin shrugged . He pulled the door shut and went with Bullock.  |p123On  days the rain let up Levin still walked on country roads . Once he passed a barn where he thought he had been with Laverne . He thought of her with desire , up to when Sadek entered . After weeks of rain he thirsted for color , the eye seekingit in whatever light . White birches stood in baths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked black bodies . Chestnut trees in strong sunlight wore orange impasto . Vine maples , the only adventurers , flared yellow , red , and purple around green at the core . In the setting sun maples turned bronze , and oaks red . Toward Thanksgiving , except for willows , flaming vine maples , and a few tenacious birch and oak , most of the trees that had leaves to lose had lost them , bare except for patches of soggy brown rags and abandoned birds nests . It seemed to Levin that just when he was about to take thep124loss , the yearly symbolic death of nature , to heart , he discovered that many of the recently harrowed fields were touched with bright green grass that turned out to be winter wheat . Bread growing in the harvested field  --  this went against pathetic fallacy . One day as he was walking outside a forest trying to persuade himself ( against the NO HUNTING , FISHING , TRESPASSING warning ) to enter and explore , he heard strange noises in the sky , and looking up , beheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geese . The fluttering , honking formation of birds was like a ship borne by the wind into the high invisible distance . Levin 's ear burned all night , as if soaked in pitch and set on fire . He wondered what omen the flight held for him and hungered for a victory over nature . Leaving Humanities Hall late one Friday afternoon , the instructorskidded on a wet leaf on the porch and his books and papers took to the air ; he landed on the wet walk , whacking his head . Star clusters popped in his brain . For a second he thought he would remember everything in his life and braced himself not to . The rain drizzled on him but he was too hurt to move . Ile was vaguely conscious some students , possibly his own , were passing by , but either he was invisible or they were in a hurry . I am a man alone , thought Levin . It seemed a long year but only minutes had gone by before he dragged himself up , found his soiled new hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Levin lay on his bed with Mrs. Beaty 's ice bag tucked under the egg at the back of his bruised and aching head . After twenty minutes ' freezing his brain he got up and stared out the dark window . None but the lonely rain . The instructor riffled through a wet set of quizzes , then thrust them into a drawer where he kept his bird watcher 's guide and a pair of cheap binoculars he had recently bought to follow things in flight . Supper , Levin ? He had planned just a Swiss cheese sandwich and a cup of tea but decided he could not stand Mrs. Beaty 's mental health in the kitchen tonight . Sadek , the clothesp125snatcher , was long since gone with his Lysol bottle , and the landlady , possibly because she realized she was ageing , had not attempted to rent his room ; which suited Levin fine . But he longed for company tonight and considered calling Avis Fliss , though not with great enthusiasm . He was disappointed at how lonely he still was after almost three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , taking over in a new land ? Had the new self failed ? He had had invitations here and there , but as Pauline and others had told him , it was tough to be a bachelor in this town . Without a family you were almost always left out . Even Bucket had never invited him to his house . Levin wanted friendship and got friendliness ; he wanted steak and they offered spam . Each day his past weighed more . He was , after all , thirty , and time moved on relentless roller skates . When , for God 's sake , came love , marriage , children ? Opening a book , he looked down a page without reading , then tossed it aside . In the cellar he filled the sawdust hopper and left the house . Levin walked in the cold rain , the wettest , dreariest he had ever been in . The town was tight around his shoulders , the wet streets long and dark , street lights obscure at corners . A man could drown mid-block and nobody would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed were totally dark . On rainy nights people went to bed ; it was , after all , a diversion for the married ; another was the small blue images of television he occasionally glimpsed through drawn curtains . Levin listened , as he walked , for a human sound and heard himself walking in the rain . He stood for five full minutesat the next street corner , not knowing which way to go , finally wandering toward the Gilleys . Half heartedly he rang the bell . A light in a glass barrel went on over his head and Gerald opened the door . When he saw who it was he seemed embarrassed . " I was passing by , " Levin explained . " But if you 're busy or otherwise occupied , I 'll make it some other time . " " We 're late getting the kids to bed , " Gilley said . He glancedp126back into the house . " Come on in if you can stand the mess . " He spoke without welcome so Levin held back . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department business ? " " No , I was just walking by  --  " He looked at the rain . Gilley peered out . " Better come on in . " He held the door open . Levin , relieved , entered , and Gerald hung up his soaked raincoat and hat . Pauline , in her violet pants , came out of the kitchen with an armful of diapers . Seeing who it was she let out a little shriek and darted up the stairs . Levin was nervously having a beer with Gilley when she reappeared in a green woolen dress . Five minutes ago in pants , uncombed hair , flat chest , she had all the appeal of a pine board . Now , with the same apparatus , the green dress , her hair brushed , she , seemed to glow . She knew how to use what she had , not a bad talent . " Excuse me for coming without phoning  --  " " Excuse me , Mr. Levin . I hope I did n't scare you out of your normal growth but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggled at the way she had put it , Gilley mildly eyeing her . " Gerald , " Pauline said , " please stack the dishwasher while I get Erik out of the tub before he goes down the drain . Excuse me for one minute , Mr. Levin . " " I came at the wrong time , " he called after them . A few minutes later , Erik , in bunny pajamas , waddled in from the bathroom and went through Levin 's beard with both hands . " Any bugs in it ? " " Butterflies . " The boy tugged at the whiskers , then ran with a little cry to the kitchen . He pushed open the swing-door and Levin saw Gerald and Pauline facing each other across a table loaded with dirty dishes.  | " We 've got to get started entertaining again , " he was saying with emotion . " It 's hurting me in the department . " She grabbed the butter dish and flung it at the wall . It hit the electric clock . The butter stuck to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Gilley yanked Erik into the kitchen and the door snapped shut . Levin put down his beer and got into his wet raincoat and hat . He was headed for the front door when Pauline , flushed , entered the room . " Oh , you 're not leaving yet , Mr. Levin ? We have n't exchanged a word . " " I 've got this headache , " he explained , removing his hat and showing her his bump . " I slipped on a leaf and hurt my head . Tell Gerald thanks for the beer . " She touched the bump gently with cold fingers , Levin consciousshe smelled like a flower garden . " I 'm awfully sorry , ca n't I get you some ice ? " " I 've had some . " He moved towards the door . " Try us again soon , " she called after him through the open door . " We 'd honestly love to see you . " He hurried away . The rain had thinned to mist , and a part-time moon wanderedamid the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn to the Student Union by the sound of dance music . He watched a dance through the barred ballroomwindow . The girls were prettier than they had ever been , the men with more possibilities than that morning in class . He stood there for a half hour , envying them their looks , their youth , their future . His own was imprisoned in the old Levin . Where is my life ? What has become of me ? he asked himself . Ancient questions . Once more the music began , the same he had heard in another time , in another world . Though Levin made no sound , his shoulders shook . My youth , my lost youth.  |p128After  recovering from Levin 's beard Avis Fliss took to visitinghim in his office to discuss the tactics of teaching remedial grammar , sometimes staying so long he grew restless . Her virtue was her unique fund of information concerning departmentand college routine ; she always knew what was due when , and usually had it in first . And she seemed to know the activities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive level his eye was drawn to her bosom and ungirdled behind . Whenever in her presence he found himself thinking of her as a woman , he sensed a response but was n't sure . What bothered him about Avis was that as soon as she came close to revealing something personal , her eyelids fluttered autonomously , her voice took flight , and when it returned she launched into a long digression addressed to his shoulder . He had , however , learned she had stopped off at Easchester several years ago , after a summer school vacation in Alaska , to surprise an old friend . The friend had been married and was gone , but Avis , possibly inspired by the event , had stayed on where it had taken place . Although she had only a bachelor 's degree , she had taught in a well-known private girls ' school , and Professor Fairchild , with Gilley 's vote  --  despite Fabrikant 's lack of enthusiasm , " though not against the lady personally although I do n't like having too many around "  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , was a " dear , " and the director of composition , whose unofficial assistant she was , " tops . " She praised him as an able man with a lovely little family , although she said once in passing that his wife was not entirely suited to him . " Really ? " said Levin . He asked her why she thought so . " Well , " she said , with a hesitant laugh , " she strikes me as the sort of person who ca n't always be depended on to strengthen a man 's rear when he 's on the march . " " On the march ? " " Advancing careerwise . " " His rear ? "  | " Figuratively speaking . Please do n't misunderstand me , Seymour , I have nothing against Pauline . She 's been nice to me , especially when I first came to Easchester , kind with invitations to their house , though I suspect Gerald had to ask her to ask me . What I have reference to is that she gives the impressionsion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine some people wonder whose fault that is and unjustly blame Gerald . She can also be absent-minded about her social responsibilities , which rather disturbs him . " " What do you mean in the midst of plenty ' ? " " What any woman would consider herself lucky to have . " " To me they look like people who generally get along . I could be wrong . " " Oh , they do , " Avis said . She seemed worried . " Please do n't quote me . " One Saturday night , Levin , with nothing to do , drifted up to the office . Down the hall Avis ' door was open but apparently no one else was around , Levin wondering if Bucket were sick . He began a letter to a second cousin , a lady in Cleveland who sometimes wrote to him , when Avis knocked . She was looking for a match , but when he had none , discovered a last one at the bottom of her purse . She stayed to smoke , resting one buttock on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , then poetry , and were soon reading aloud to each other from an anthology . Levin read several stanzas from " The Eve of St. Agnes , " and Avis read Tennyson 's " Flower in the Crannied Wall . " One poem led to another , and soon Levin , taking Avis ' bashful hand , gently drew her down upon his lap . A blessed thing , poetry . They kissed , Levin suffused in her orange blossom and tobacco aroma , then kissed again more deeply . " Your whiskers tickle , " she laughed , her bosom heaving . " You ought to cut them off . " " Never . " " " For a person who is n't handsome , Seymour , you act as though you were . "  | " Ha ha , " laughed Levin . After another breathless kiss Avis suggested they go for a drive . " Fine , " he said . " Where 's your car ? " " I was thinking of yours . " " I have none . " " Oh , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . " " Tst-tst . " To test what she had in mind , he said , " We could walk if you do n't mind the rain . " She coughed bronchially . He was considering his room . They could sneak up the back stairs , only Mrs. Beaty was tonight entertaining some club ladies . If sex was approaching Levin wanted it without the worry of visitors . " What about your place ? " he asked . " I dare n't . The landlady 's teen-age daughter sleeps in the next room to mine . " He was weighing other possibilities when Avis hopped quickly up out of his lap . " What was that ? " She listened tensely at the door . " I thought I heard footsteps . " He listened . " Nothing . " Levin was aroused . They kissed at the door . He felt for her nipple . Avis pushed his hand away . An old maid , he thought , I 'd better not . " Would you rather go to a movie ? " " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then let 's be honest , " Levin said . " Will you come with me to a hotel ? " " Not in town . We 'd be recognized as faculty people . I know I would . So would you with your beard . " " We could take a cab to the one in Marathon . It would n't be too expensive . " " The night clerk in Marathon is one of my former Grammar Z students , " Avis said . " Could n't we stay here ? " " In the office ? "  | " Might we ? " Levin seized a practical suggestion . " Gladly . I 'll spread my raincoat on the desk . " " The desk ? " She hesitated . " It seems sacrilegious . " " I hate to mention the floor but what else is there ? " " I have a blanket I keep in my office for football games , " Avis said . " Marvelous . Shall I go get it ? " " You 'll find it in my closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back she had her dress and shoes off and was in brassiere and half slip . He folded the blanket lengthwise on the floor , then removed his jacket and tie . As they were undressing they heard unmistakable footsteps coming up the stairs . Avis frantically stepped into her slippers and pulled on her dress . Levin got his shirt partly buttoned , and tie on , knotted badly . He helped her zip her dress . A knock sounded on the door . " Sy ? " The voice was Gilley 's . Levin shuddered . The danger was if he said nothing Gerald might open the door with the common key . Avis frantically gestured : answer . " Here , " Levin said . He said , " Avis is with me . " There was a pause . " Could I see you ? " " Why not ? " He heaped the blanket and kicked it under the desk . Avis had seated herself and poked her dead nose into a grammar text . Her poor neck was rigid . " I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mackinaw and boots , and was holding a hunting cap . Avis smiled dimly . " Hello , Gerald . " She looked a wreck . Gilley 's eyes roved uneasily but Levin 's glance assured him the blanket was invisible . " Avis has been helping me in Grammar Z. She says I 'm trying to cover too much in an hour . " " Good , " said Gilley . He said he had come up for a book for Pauline . " George and I are taking off for some early shooting.  |p132We  usually snooze in his wagon and are right on the spot when the ducks fly in . Pauline has n't been sleeping too well lately and she wants something by Hardy around . All we have home is The Return of the Native , which she reread recently . Have you got something by him in your bookcase , Sy , maybe Far From the Madding Crowd ? Maybe you have , Avis ? " " No , Gerald , I do n't care for Hardy . " Levin searched his shelves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think she 's read that . Could I give either or both of you a lift ? " " Not me , thanks , " Levin said . " Nor me , " said Avis . " I promised to return a set of quizzes Monday . Now that Seymour has his lessons in shape I think I 'll go back to my office and finish grading my tests . I hate to work on Sundays . Good night , gentlemen . " " Good night , Avis , " Gerald said . " Good night , " said Levin . She walked quickly down the hall . " Thanks for the book , " Gilley said . " Do n't work too late , Sy . " " I 'll quit soon . " Levin yawned . " Got a letter to my cousin to finish up . " Gerald lingered . He does n't believe me , Levin thought . " Give my best to Pauline . I hope she sleeps tonight . " " She has these periods . " He said after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window Duffy cracked , replaced . " " I would appreciate it . " " Gilley said , " Listen , Sy , you might as well know the boss is very strict about the separation of the sexes in offices . That 's why he 's never allowed a man and a woman to share one . " " You do n't say ? " " I just want to give you an idea how he thinks . " " I 'm much obliged . " Still Gilley stayed . " Avis is a very nice gal , but if I were you I 'd keep in mind that women her age who are n't married can be upset pretty easily . Well , so long . "  | " Good night , Gerald . Tell Pauline I hope she sleeps well . " " She will . She has these periods on and off . " When Gilley had gone , Levin rested his head on his arms on the desk . His galloping heart slowed down to a fast trot . He finished his letter and was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up , her orange blossom renewed . Her eyelids throbbed . " Shall we  --  go on ? " Levin peeled his jacket , snapped the lock , and again spread the blanket . " This time we 'd better put out the light , " she said . When her brassiere came off , her breasts , handsome under clothes , hung like water-filled balloons from her chest . Levin shivered a bit , that splendid bosom formless . Still , for a starvingmanOnce more they embraced , Levin in white shorts , Avis in pink panties . He snapped off the light . Again she stopped his hand when he touched her left breast . " Not that one , it hurts . " " Hurts ? " " Feel this . " Her fingers guided his . He felt a long scar on the underside of her breast . She said she had once had an operation . " It was a benign fibroma . Now I have another and the doctor says it 's the same thing but I 'll have to have it out anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what hurts when you press . " He felt a hard spot under his fingers . Levin snapped on the light . " Why , what 's the matter ? " Avis asked . " I 'm sorry for your breast . " " Do n't worry about it . You may fondle the other . " Poor dame , he thought . She has little , why should I make it less ? He wavered indecisively , then reached for his pants and drew them on.  | " I do n't understand , " she faltered . " Are n't you  --  are n't we going on ? " " When we have a better place , when you feel better , " Levin said . " I do n't want to hurt you . " Avis dressed quickly , grabbed her football blanket and left furiously . To escape occasionally from town and loneliness , Levin , after much debate with himself  --  having consulted Bucket and Courtney Haddock , who knew about second-hand cars , bought himself one . He had arranged with a student of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former hot rodder now majoring in automotive engineering , to accompany him to a used-car lot . Almost everyone of his freshman could drive , and most of them owned cars , usually new , but not Levin . Lyman helped him settle on a 1946 Hudson , a brown , twodoor , five-passenger sedan , which though it sagged a bit in the rear , was in decent shape ; and Levin agreed to pay three hundred and fifty dollars , a sum it made him nervous to owe anybody . IIe later learned he had bought ex-Dean Feeney 's trade-in for the latest model . The Hudson did n't look like something he had dreamed of , but at least it moved on wheels , and so might Levin . He knew the town and a mile or two beyond , but not much more . It was time to venture forth . Lyman drove the Hudson home and parked it in Mrs. Beaty 's garage . The next day he gave Levin his first driving lesson . The instructor fancied he would learn fairly quickly but found himself less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it was possible to shift , accelerate , turn , while watching direction , signs , and traffic  --  a confusing task for a mind that was non-mechanical or had come too late to mechanics . At the same time he felt a useless anger against himself for not at once mastering this carapace of tin over box of oil-soaked nuts and bolts . Two weeks later he knew the operation of the car but still overshot corners and skidded against curbs when pulling to a stop . He was uneasy in traffic , especially whenp135making left turns off busy streets . What bothered him most was that he was careless in ways he would not have predicted : momentarily lost in thought he could forget stop signs , and which was one way in a one-way street . Twice Lyman had to grab the wheel to prevent a mishap . As a result , Levin had his fears of the car and said so . Lyman said , " We all have to die sometime sooner or later . " " Better later , " Levin muttered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Levin would feel better once he had passed his test and driven a hundred miles alone . However , Levin seriouslyconsidered giving up the car and going back to walking . He was at best a bus and subway man . As for loneliness , better than a car was a girl ; he would look actively now . A few days later he failed his driver 's test and went home humiliated , convinced he must part with the car . Lyman offeredto see if one of his frat brothers was interested , and Levin agreed to sell for three hundred dollars . He was ashamed of himself and mildly depressed . But after supper that night he sneaked downstairs , and backing the Hudson out of the garage , took off alone , a feat to begin with . It was of course raining and he felt a throb of satisfaction when he turned on the windshield wiper and it worked . Levin drove slowly in the rain , his heart beating thickly over the illegal thing he was doing , at the same time thinking he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt intensely the danger of the adventure , pictured himself blundering into accident , arrest , being forbidden to drive in Cascadia , possibly sent to jail . It would all get into the paper , and everybody , including his students , would know him for the fool and lawbreaker he , by nature , was . Bent over the wheel , peering into the dewy gloom , he drove in the emptiest part of town , practicing turns from street to street , and later  --  heart high and dry  --  drove downtown . Almost at once he saw the police car coming his way and felt paralysis of arm and leg ; but when the car with its spinning blinker passed him , neither of the cops giving him so much as a glance ,  |p136Levin  headed for the main highway out of Easchester . He drove for three miles at his fastest speed ever , a breakneck forty-five  --  then not to tempt fate , turned at a gas station and drove back . Behind him on the misty light-studded highway lay San Francisco , ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S.A. as a structure of highways and freeways , Levin at the wheel , embarked on one leading to another , speeding up hill and down in his trusty Hudson , his lance at his side , driving through a series of amorous and philanthropic adventures . Home safely , though his legs trembled when he stepped out of the car , he was all in one piece and marvelously elated . After passing his driver 's test and getting his license , Levin was giving some thought to calling Avis Fliss , if at all feasible , when an attractive girl in one of his classes , Nadalee HammerAad , began to haunt the surprised forefront of his mind . One day as they were sitting together in his office , discussing her latest theme  --  she had come in to ask about her grades  --  Nadalee , imperceptibly leaning forward , nuzzled her hard little breast against Levin 's lonely elbow . He moved his arm as if bitten although somehow managing not to be abrupt , at the same time considering the touch unintentional  --  someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs , and although he could almost not believe it , the breast again caressed . To test whether this was his imaginationoverworking , Levin kept his arm where it had been , and the girl for the third time gave him this unmistakable sign of her favor as he droned on about her writing , his thoughts in the wild wind . Two minutes later she thanked him for his criticism and left with a happy smile , not the vaguest sign of a blush on her , although Levin glowed as with high fever . He had noticed her more than once , a slim girl with short dark-brown hair , pretty , with greenish eyes , mature face , and shapely figure . Although her lower lip was thin andp137she used eyebrow pencil a bit smearily , she had a way with clothes . Whereas the other girls in her class were contented with skirts and sweaters of pastel shades , or blouses , Nadalee fitted into tight dresses and favored bright colors , a blessing on rainy days . The freshman girls smelled of body heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which when it touched Levin 's nostrils , never failed to interest him . When she slid into her seat in the second row he knew it without looking . There was about her a quality of having been and seen , that made the instructor feel he could talk to her . And she wrote well , sometimes imaginatively . IIe felt let down when she was absent . Still , he paid her no special attention , and had given her not much thought after class until her visit to his office . After that she was in his mind so tenaciously it wearied him . Nadalee took on a private uniqueness , a nearness and dearnessas though he were in love with her . Although he told himself he was n't , she had in a sense offered love , and love was what Levin wanted . Though he tried diligently to cast her out of his thoughts , she sneaked back in with half her clothes off to incite him to undress the rest of her . He tried to figure out how to achieve an honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another season  --  if let 's say , in the Catskills in July or August , he might with comparatively undisturbed conscience have taken a bite of what she offered . But here in Easchester , at Cascadia College , English io , SectionY , 11 A.M. MWF , she was his student and he her instructor , in loco parentis , practically a sacred trust . Levin determined to forget the girl , but his determination was affected by hers . Nadalee appeared in class , the day after the time she had upset him in his office , in one of her prettiest dresses , a thickly petticoatedaffair , white with wine stripes encircling hips , belly and breasts . She crossed and uncrossed her slim young legs enhanced in nylon stockings . On her narrow feet she wore black ballet slippers in which , without much trouble , he could see her on her toes in Swan Lake , himself the evil magician.  |p138Surely  , he thought , this dressing up is n't for me ; and though he went on in class as if he knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  to consume and be consumed . Afterwards , alone in his office , his chest palpitating as though he were contemplating murder , or flying off on a roaring drunk , Levin reread her themes and in one came across a biographicalbit he could n't understand why he had forgotten . When she was eighteen she had spent a summer on her uncle 's ranch in Northern California . In the afternoon when it was hot Nadalee rode her horse to a small lake surrounded by pine trees , tossed off shirt and bra , stepped out of Levis and underpants , and dived into the cold blue water . Though Levin 's legs cramped after a too hasty immersion in cold water , he jumped in after her and spent most of the night swimming with Nadalee . The next day the sight of her skirt clinging to her thighs was enough to upset him . After once glancing at her , every line lovely , conscious of his relentless consciousness of her he vowed not to look again , and managed not to that morning , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butchered him . He beheld his slaughtered face in the mirror and stared at it , wretched . How escape the ferocious lust that enflamed and tormented his thoughts as it corroded his will ? Why must Levin 's unlived life put him always in peril ? Why obsessively seek what was lost  --  unlived  --  in the past ? He had no wish to be Faust , or Gatsby ; or St. Anthony of Somewhere , who to conquer his torment , had nipped off his balls . Levin wanted to be himself , at peace in present time . He tried various means of self-control : exhortation , rationalization , censorship , obfuscation . One trick was to think of the girl as his daughter . He was her old man and had watched her grow from a thing in dirty diapers . At twelve she was menstruating ; on her eighteenth birthday Levin married her off to a successful lawyer , to whom she bore seven children in six years , all boys . Her father , ever a man to be tempted by every damned temptation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight breeze to make a connection  --  was safe and sound in her invasive presence , until by a dirty stroke of fate ( try as he would Levin-pere could not reverse it ) the lawyer expired of a heart attack from overwork . But Nadalee was financially provided for , so Levin went off to Europe to live , traveling from country to country this side the iron curtain . It could n't be said he did n't enjoy his life , though where exactly was home ? Several years later , in Sevilla  --  he was then fifty-five going on fifty-six  --  half drunk on val de pefias one festival night before the corrida , he met this masked beauty at a costume ball . One tango led to another , the dance to a sense of fundamental intimacy  --  what , after all , is a dance ? So , whispering together  --  Levin confessing most of his sins , including advancing age , the senorita saying nothing of importance  --  theyleft for his suite at the Hilton . First they ate . George , the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats , manchiego cheese and some dry white capri , iced in buckets ; after coffee a bottle of anis del mono , which tasted like licorice and warmed all the way . Then they made love . The masked beauty refused  --  despite the inconvenience , which she argued was tit for tat for his grizzled beard  --  to remove her disguise until it was unalterably too late . When he looked at her true face at dawn , he groaned at the misery he had committed . Levin thereupon put out both eyes and threw himself off a high cliff into the shark-infested sea . He argued with himself : I have evil thoughts , expensive to my spirit ; they represent my basest self . I must expunge them by will , no weak thing in man . I must live by responsibility , an invention of mine in me . The girl trusts me , I ca n't betray her . If I want sex I must be prepared to love , and love may mean marriage . ( I live by my nature , not Casanova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her I 'd better stay away . He exhorted himself : teach her only grammar , the principle parts of verbs , spelling , punctuation  --  nothing not in the syllabus . He would not let the casual brush of a girl 's breast against his sleeve seduce him into acting without honor . The self would behavep140as it must . She would not make a fool of him , much less a worm . He would , in denial , reveal the depth of his strongest , truest strength . Character over lust . By night , after these terrible exertions , including two cold showers , Levin 's mind was comparatively calm  --  he had bludgeoned desire , and though exhausted , beaten half to death by the bloody club he carried against the self , felt more or less at peace . About a week later , Levin encountered Nadalee , one morning , in the college bookstore . He had been wandering among the book tables and looked up , experiencing overwhelming relief to find her by his side , for he had at once seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice kid . Levin observed with interest the errors of her face and figure , the thin underlip , too heavily penciled brows ; her legs less than slim although not actually skinny , and her childlike balletslipperedfeet . Objectivity , if it did less for her , did more for him . It was her youth that moved me , Levin thought . Also her unexpected favor . He desired those who found him desirable , a too easy response ; he must watch this in himself . Nadalee said she was looking for an entertaining novel and could he suggest one : " It 's a gift  --  a birthday present for guess who ?  --  me , I 'm twenty today . " Levin congratulated her . " Twenty , did you say ? " She explained why she was two years older than most freshman . " You see , I worked in a bank before coming here . " But the bank had bored her , so she had quit and registered , with some financial assistance from her father , at Cascadia College . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidestep the impression it might be good news . Could good news be bad ? Her age , perhaps , explained her maturity . Yet twenty was not too different from eighteen . Before he could decide how different , if different , or where or why different , he hastened to think : she 's still too young  --  ten years between us  --  a kid . Just look at her feet . Besides I 'm her teacher . Levin found her a novel , tipped his hat , and left for lunch . Later , to prove he trusted his strength he telephoned her top141ask if she liked to walk . " Madly , " Nadalee answered . Since she honestly interested him , he had made up his mind it would be better for his nerves if he saw her now and then , in a Platonic relationship . A walk , a bit of a drive here and there , at most a movie in a neighboring town . Company , talk  --  a blessing under the right circumstances . They met in the park by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poplin raincoat ; Levin had his on . They wandered along the bank of the Sacajawea . The morning had been gray but this afternoon was blue , infused with light of the invisible sun . " Do n't you just love the day when it 's like this ? " Nadalee said . " Very much . " " Look at those clouds in the west . How would you describe them ? " " Vaporous , toiling . " " Tempestuous , like some people 's emotions ? " " Whose , for instance ? " " Yours . " " You are observant , " he said with a sigh , " mature . " " I 'm glad you finally noticed . " Levin bent for a stone to scale on the water but it sank with a plop . " If you had any idea that I am a little-innocent , " she said , watching the ripples in the water , " well , I 'm not , if that 's what you 're worried about . I was once engaged to be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , against desire , fell on his head . He asked in hidden anguish , " Why do you tell me that ? " " Because I am a woman and wish to be treated so . " " By me ? " " Yes , if you must know . " " But why me ? " he asked . " I guess you know I 'm different than most of the other girlsp142in your class ? I 'm tired of college boys . I want real com-panionship . " " But why me ? " Levin said . " There are other men around , graduate students , instructors , some handsome . " " I bet you 'd be better looking without your beard . " " No , I would n't . " " Anyway , the answer is you happen to appeal to me . I 've always liked the intellectual type . I like the way you talk , it 's very sincere . " He was humbly grateful to her . They were standing under a tree and impulsively kissed , her young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat fell off . Levin said , as they went on , hands locked , " I do n't have to tell you Nadalee , the need for absolute secrecy ? Many people would not understand or approve this . It could make trouble . " She said she had thought of that and had a scheme for them to spend some time together alone if he agreed . He agreed . Her aunt , Nadalee said , owned a little motel on the coast . She was planning to visit her daughter in Missoula next weekend , and whenever she left she closed up and lit the novacancysign . There was n't much business at this time of the year , only occasional tourists and some hunters or fishermen . Anyway , Nadalee had promised to look after the place and they could have it to themselves . " We could walk on the beach and the dunes , and picnic and ride around , and just sort of relax . My aunt wo n't get home till late on Sunday . " Levin resisted every sentence but his imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Came Friday . He was resolved to go but not necessarily to collect . The fun was having a place to go , companionship , not something he could unfairly get from the girl . He was obliged to treat her responsibly . He would explain this when he got there  --  she had left by bus that morning but he had a one o'clock to teach ; it had been decided they were not to go or come back together . Let 's be friends , Levin planned top143say . If we can honestly be , later we may think of sex . It will come more pleasurably to friends  --  a two-fold blessing . That he had reached this conclusion satisfied him . After trimming his beard a half-inch around he drove out of Easchester in a marvelous mood . For the first time in his life Levin was on the road alone in a car  --  his own  --  carried along on his own power , so to say . Three cheers for the pioneers of the auto industry ; they had put him on wheels to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things he had learned to do in his few months here : had mowed frequent lawns , the grass still green and growing in December ; raked a billion leaves , fifty percent from neighboring trees ; gathered walnuts in October ; picked yellow pears ; regularly attended and even cleaned Mrs. B 's rumbling sawdust furnace , and so on and what not . Last week he had washed and waxed his car . Levin the handy man ; that is to say , man of hands . And here he was with both of them solidly on the wheel , miraculously in motion along the countryside , enjoying the compression of scenery . Heading towards unknown mountains in voyage to the Pacific Ocean , world 's greatest . Imagine , Levin from Atlantic to Pacific  --  who would have thought so only a few years ago ?  --  seeing up close sights he had never seen before : big stone mountains ahead , thick green forests , unexpected farms scattered over the hillsides , the ghostly remains of forest fire , black snags against the sky . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed a log truck , surely half a block long , pyramided high with enormous tree trunks , heavily chained , thank God . Here and there millponds were afloat with brown logs , to be fished out and cut into boards . He whizzed past a smoldering , tree-tall furnace shaped like a shuttlecock , a black slash burner that consumedwood waste , its head ablaze at night . He was discoveringin person the face of America . And the weather was better than the newspaper had expected . For short intervals warm sunlight  --  through thick clouds breaking into sky streams  --  lit the fields ; some harboring sheep ,  |p144a  few with starlings on their backs , picking a living out of the wool . At times the clouds massed darkly , yet the day managed to be cheery , and the bright green winter wheat yielded hiddenlight . Levin guessed the temperature was around fifty , and this they called onset of winter . It said so on the calendar , and Mrs. Beaty was airing her winter undies and talking of Christmas . Who immersed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant weather ? Here , Bucket had told him , spring came sometimes in midwinter ; autumn in the right mood might hang on till January , and at times spring lingered through summer . A season and a half they called it but Levin would not complain . Only a week ago he had caught the odor of a white rose in the best of health on somebody'sfront lawn . So what if they paid in wetness for the mild climate ; the warmth made up for rain , and was n't it wonderful to be riding to the beach in December ? Who but a polar bear would indulge in the Bronx ? He saw stone ascending and discovered himself doing the same . " Holy Moses , I 'm up a mountain . " As the road turned , his startled sight beheld below a vast forest of pointed conifers , and as he emerged from a corkscrew curve , a mass of peaks  --  rocks and shadow  --  extended into the dim distance . " Alps on Alps arise . " His heart leapt at the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling on , how sheer the drop if he dropped , his heart settled with a wham and he found himselftoiling at driving . WARNING , SHARP CURVES . He was sweating to master them as his tires screeched , rolling the wheel as if fighting a storm at sea ; to stay on the road yet keep from hitting anything that might come zooming around the bend  --  ahead invisibletill he got there ; also to move fast enough to satisfy the irritable pest behind him , sprung up from nowhere and blasting his horn till Levin had a headache . He was doing twenty and considered crawling at ten but did n't dare with this madman behind him . He tried to signal the fiend to stop with the horn , or quell him with a dirty look in the mirror , but no signals worked and he had to keep his eyes glued ahead forp145fear of losing the slightest sight of the perilous , tortuous road . Another blast of the horn filled him with rage and dismay . He considered stopping and getting out to grapple with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and Levin pulled hard against the side of the cliff to let the monster pass . He furiously shook his fist as a dilapidated Chevy squeezed by , the pee-wee driver with a snip of black mustache , more Chaplin than Hitler , offering a thumbed nose . His dusty license plate read New Jersey  --  too small world . With no further stomach for tight curves , Levin considered giving his breath a rest , but since no one any longer fastened onto his tail he went his winding way , conscious of abysses deeper than those in dreams , worried that a momentary lapse of attentionmight send him hurtling into the murderous maw of the forest below , dead , destroyed , never to be seen again . Yet he negotiated each curve as it came , some bent into such unpredictabletormented arcs that it flashed on him he knew for the first time in his life what " straight " meant ; and this insight carried him down the mountain onto a peaceful road . Peaceful for a short happy while , then the grade rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Levin got used to it : Steeplechase , you did what the bear did . There were many mountains and you took them one by one , paying no attention to the rest of the family . Soon the worst seemed over . Descending , Levin was surprised to sail through a momentaryhamlet , a cluster of jerry-built , long-unpainted houses around a general store with a dirty gas pump in front . Here too America ; you learned as you lived , a refreshing change from books . Out of the townlet and embarked on a broadly winding level road , he hypnotically watched a puff of smoke float up from his radiator and evaporate , Levin at once apprehensiveof trouble although he could n't call it by name . He wondered whether to drive back to the gas pump , but the narrowness of the twisting road made a turn impossible . And he did n't like going back once the plan was to go forward . It was getting late , he was slow , Nadalee was waiting . Hep146studied the hood at intervals , and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first service station he hit . By the merest chance his eye caught the progress of the needle of the temperature gauge . It was flirting with HOT . " What 'll I do now ? " Levin asked himself , trying to recall what the manual that came with the car said , but remembering only confusion . So he drove on till he again spied smoke . The red needle had struck HOT . Fearing fire , he quickly brought the Hudson to a stop on the road and shut off the ignition . A cloud of steam rose from the radiator . Levin , agitated , lifted the hood . He burned his fingers trying to unscrew the water cap , then managed to turn it with a folded handkerchief . A hissing stream of steam and bubbling brown water spilled over , a pox on ex-Dean Feeney . Levin remembered having read about thisunder BOILING OVER . Two hours later he was on his way again . The sun was sinkingand he was very late . He had been pushed by a pickup truck to a small gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose **26;3274;TOOLONG had " gone home for half hour , " it said on a stenciled strip of cardboard on the gas pump . Levin fretted as he waited , because he had only twenty dollars in his pocket and Friday was going fast . When at last the man had appeared , he recommended a reverse flush , and though this sounded like a bad poker hand it suited Levin if somebody who knew said so ; but the operation took more than an hour , the man wandering off every so often to attend his pump or sell something . Levin walked down the road and sat on a rock watching time hurrying by and nothing he could do about it . He considered trying to call Nadalee to tell her what had happened but gave it up as too complicated . He had estimated  --  she had  --  that they would be together by four , but four had come and gone , and with it went some of the beauty of the day and the pleasure of anticipation , because he liked things to work out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this incident as a warning of sorts , yet cheered up when the car was ready , paid twelvep147dollars courageously , and was again en voyage with a full gas tank and recommended change of oil , although he had changed it last week . He warily watched the temperature gauge , sufferingwhen the needle went up and rejoicing when it settled back . Since the coast was only thirty-five miles away , he gave himself at the very most an hour to get there , counseling calm , the fun was yet to be , Nadalee will wait for me . The road was presently good and he clocked five miles in six minutes . Although the sun had sunk , and shade arose in the fields , a golden-green glow hung in the sky . He enjoyed the stillness , each tree still , the timbered hills multiplying silence . With some misgiving he climbed a new rise . At the first turn of the road a log truck , like a fat worm pulling itself out of a hole in the earth , rumbled forth hauling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen ; it looked like a threat to humanity . He pulled the Hudson quickly to the shoulder of the road , holding his foot hard on the brake until the long truck puffed by . When Levin was ready to move he discovered he could n't , his right rear wheel sunk in a ditch . " I 'll die , " he muttered after twenty minutes of struggling to free the wheel . Not one car had come by . He pictured himselffrozen to death in the Hudson during the night . In the morning they would haul off a stiff corpse ; he had read of these things in the paper . Levin desperately figured he had to do something , but the right rear wheel had no respect for reason or will . He was wondering why he had come on this impossible journey when a tractor rattled around the bend and wobbled towards him . It was an old machine , the farmer driving it a wizened man with a small leathery face . He wore a wilted straw hat , and sat up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's astonishment the machine passed by , the farmer lost in thought ; he had to yell to get his attention . With a clank the tractor came to a halt , the driver gazing back at Levin as though he could n't understand where he had risen from.  | " Excuse me for bothering you , " Levin explained , " but I 'm stuck in this ditch . " The farmer in silence got down from the seat , dug a length of rope out of his tool box and knotted it to Levin 's front bumper . In less than a minute the Hudson was out of the ditch . It had happened so fast he could hardly believe it . " Three cheers for the American Farmer ! " The farmer smiled wanly . " Say , " he said , " could you give me a hand with some trouble I been havin ' of my own ? " " Gladly , " said Levin , " although I have an important engage-ment . " He stepped out of the car . The fanner fished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle-nose pliers . " Got an achin ' tooth here at the back of my mouth . Could you give it a pull with these pliers ? " Levin 's muscles tightened to the point of shivers . He saw himself trying to pull the tooth , breaking it , not being able to get it all out , as the man bled , and it ended by his having to drive him to the hospital . Yet he wanted to show his gratitude to the farmer for rescuing him from the ditch . " Could n't 1 drive you to a dentist ? " he said . " I 'm on my way to the coast . " " Ca n't stand ' em , " the farmer said . " An ' I got thirty head of Angus to look after . I 'm alone by myself since the missus died . " Opening his mouth he touched a gnarled finger to the offending tooth , a discolored snag . Levin tried several times to get the pliers gripping the tooth . " Is this it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew the pliers from the farmer 's mouth and handed them to him . " I 'd only hurt you without doing any good . " " Sure hurts anyway , " the man said . He tossed the pliers into the tool box and climbed up on his high seat . The tractor rattled down the hill . " God bless your tooth , " Levin called after him . Failed again , he thought.  |p149He  started the Hudson and stepped on the gas . " Nadalee , I 'm coming . " It was almost six . I 've got to make time . He sped along the mountain road , wondering why it was so dark , then hurriedly switched on his lights , gasping as the beams flew forward and were trapped in pools of fog . A sense of doom infected him and he fell to brooding . Where is the fog , in or out ? He had slowed to a crawl , every minute convinced he would the very next go shooting into space . Should he stay rooted ? If he stopped where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to stay put until the fog lifted , if it did , in the morning . If he went on how would he know if he was on the road or off  --  levitated in space before the ultimate crash , decapitation , dismemberment  --  what sort of terrible end for a man who had lived through so much in his life and had so many plans ? He drove on with droplets of mist in his beard , at ten miles an hour , and could see only as many feet ahead , frightened by awesome crags that loomed up before him and the fragments of bare rock over his head . Every few seconds he braked , sounding his horn like a wail as he went , by the greatest good luck skirting half-hidden boulders and grotesquely twisted tree trunks whose crowns were shrouded in fog . He had endlessvisions of disaster , monotonously called himself " idiot " for having invented this purgatorial journey . Levin promised himselfhe would celebrate if he got out alive . It seemed to him , his nerves pricking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abandoned road , had started as a child but was surely by now somebody 's grandpa , his hair turned bone-white , although the face , when he caught a reflected glimpse of it , looked hauntingly dark . He felt he had crawled on for hours , without confidence that he knew which road was presently which , and after a while , with a sense of not much caring . He went where the road went , because it was there ; where it ended he would . He saw then , lit in his headlights , a horse  --  could it be ?  |  --  No , this was a mule standing immobile in the road , gazing at something in the night . It slowly came to Levin , for he was worn out , that the mule was not a nightmare ; it was real and he was staring at it from a distance of thirty feet ; and that the fog had broken into moving patches ; the sky glowing with stars , amid them the moon . Yet even as he sighed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a stone statue , stood broadside on the road , impassable at either end . Ten feet from the animal Levin stopped the car and got out to see what he could do about moving it , offering first a Life Saver , gingerly holding it a foot from the mule 's nose , hoping it might mistake the candy for sugar , but its nostrils did n't even mildly twitch . Levin , walking down the road in the glare of his headlights , tore up some wet ferns . He tried holding out a handful but the salad did not tempt the animal . In exasperationhe hunted for a rock to bounce off its bony back , but as he was looking , gave up the thought . In the car he cradled his head on his arms folded on the wheel . The horn blast startled the mule . It gave a frightened whinny and took off in an unknown direction . The moonlit road stretched ahead for visible miles and Levin made fast time . But after he had traveled another twenty-five and still saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was he on the right road or headed for Mexico or Canada ? Would he get there tonight ? Would she still be waiting ? With these worries he drove through a covered bridge , and as he emerged , saw headlights rising in the distance . Levin pulled to a hasty stop several feet beyond the bridge . After two minutes a car approached . Stepping out of his Hudson , Levin waved both arms and succeeded in flaggingdown a Dodge of ancient vintage , the driver braking to a screeching stop . " If you 'll pardon me , " Levin said , " I 'm looking for the coast . How far to go would you say ? " The driver , an old man wearing a large hat and rimless glasses , peered at Levin 's limp beard.  | " You a Mormon or somethin ' ? " " Just a citizen . " " Live in Cascadia ? " " Yes . " The man lifted his hat , and with a finger of the same hand , scratched his veinous bald cranium . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it t' other way ? " He pointed back over Levin 's shoulder . A minute later his car disappeared into the covered bridge . Levin , about to collapse , tried to figure where he had gone wrong . He guessed in the fog . Somewhere in it he had missed a turn and taken the wrong direction . It served him right for his evil intentions . As he drove aimlessly on , in sadness contemplating all the failures of his life , the multifarious wrong ways he had gone , the waste of his going , he sniffed a sea smell . Whirling down the window , he smelled again and let out a cry . The ocean ! Either the old geezer had n't understood his questionor was lost himself ; maybe he had suspected Levin was a Russian spy . He beheld in the distance a golden lace of moonlight on the dark bosom of the vast sea . Ocean in view , oh the joy . " My God , the Pacific ! " He saw himself as stout Cortez  --  Balboa , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both eyes moist . Some minutes later he asked at a service station the way to Nadalee 's aunt 's place . Though it was about nine when he got there , the motel was dark , no sign lit . But Levin knocked on each cabin door until a light went on in one , and the door fell open . There stood Nadalee in a sheer nightie . " Mr. Levin  --  I mean Seymour . " " Nadalee  --  I got lost . " Before he could say where or why , she had shucked off her garment and her gloriously young body shed light as he hungrily embraced it.  |p152In  the past , Dr. Fabrikant had told Levin , Professor Fairchild , to uphold standards of efficiency and purity , had locked the composition instructors  --  mostly ladies then  --  in one large classroomas they collectively graded departmental objective exams . Although with advancing age he had changed some of his ways , under Gilley other curious customs prevailed , for instancethe competition among instructors and those assistant professors who taught comp , to get done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gerald said he did not encourage the race for itself , though he enjoyed races , but he liked to have comp grades in well ahead of the registrar 's deadline , so he asked all possible speed in correcting papers , tallying scores , and submitting term grades . Though Levin functioned poorly in a rush , he feared being left out of things , so he raced along with the others for hours without pausing to drink or pass water.  |p153Each  exam paper consisted of two hundred short-answer questions on eight mimeographed pages , and the instructor had one hundred and fourteen students , including Grammar Z inmates , who had their own objective tests , made up by Avis . Levin hurriedly counted correct answers , making little red check marks down the margin of the page , later changing to economical dots . He totaled aloud , wrote the number of right answers at the bottom of the page and hastily flipped to the next sheet , once in a while taking a few seconds to work his fingers against cramp . He fidgeted and sweated when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , worrying that they might be turning in their scores while he sat with a great stack of uncorrected papers in front of him . Though the coffee room was open for business , and he thirsted for tea , he did n't dare go in , fearing to fall farther behind . Avis was the talented one at this game and usually led the pack ; at the very worst she came in second to Bullock , another speedster . Her flushed joy in victory matched Gilley 's beamish approval of her deed ; he liked a winner . Try as he would , Levin was no match for the professionals , although he began to like the competitive hurry and the pleasuresof simple arithmetic ; but he finished third from last . Gerald afterwards ribbed him and Farper , who had come in after him , for holding up the making of the departmental curve for an hour . This was the Bell graph of grade scores , which Gilley , according to set percentages , divided into letter grades . As each instructor had handed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a master tally . When the statistics were in , the director of composition retired behind his locked office door and working with a slide rule he was fond of , carefully plotted the curve and divided it into segments , indicating the number of A 's , B 's , etc. , that would be permitted . He hoped someday to have an IBM machine that would do the job , grading and all , in a jiffy . Milly then typed the statistics of the curve on a stencil , which she ran off like a newspaper extra . Gerald grabbed up these papers and strodep154down the hall , handing one to each man who taught comp . Ed Purtzer , formerly a track star , distributed a pile to his colleagues on the third floor . With this latest information , the instructors were able to inscribe letter grades on each exam paper . Once they had this done , they arrived at term marks by averaging the d.o. , with class quiz , and theme averages , the latter two having been figured out during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition would end at this point , since it was late in the day , dark outside , but many of the comp people returned after supper to complete grades and transcribe them on two sets of cards so they could hand them to Milly first thing in the morning . Once all grades were in , working again from the individual tally sheets , Gilley drew a bar graph in colors to show how each man had fared in d.o . results . Avis again excelled ; she had the longest red bar , signifying highest number of A 's , whereas Levin had a medium-sizebar . Hers was twice as long as his , a fact that made him feel momentarily ashamed . He tried to find out who the maul with the smallest red bar was , hoping to befriend him , but Gilley would n't say . Later Bucket confessed it was he . " I never teach directly for the d.o. , " he said . " These tests are distasteful to me . " " Aha , " said Levin . Levin found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their meeting in August , the one who had cut her throat outside her instructor 's bedroom window . She often popped into his mind as he was running the subtle course between encouraging Nadalee not to expect very much more of their lovemaking and pretending he was n't . It had been a mostly happy weekend for Levin until he had left her ; only then would he admit he had felt no true affection for the girl , and that was enough to undo in aftermath some of his pleasure . This reaction was an old stock-in-trade of his and did not help endear him to himself . Why he should feelp155no genuine affection for Nadalee after his previous hot desire for her , he blamed to some degree on the disappointment of his trip through the mountains , and also on the fact that he had perhaps too severely previously subdued his ardency foi her ; or if it was n't exactly that , certainly affection had been overlaid with a fear that troubled him all along , not that she would slit her throat under the cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their affair leaked out , it would end his career at Cascadia with a backbreaking thump . Levin worried she might give them away by a changed attitude , or sign , however unconscious or unwilling , that the teacher-student relationship had shifted to something more personal . It turned out that for the remaining few days of the fall term there was no serious change in her , except that she pretended nothing had gone on between them , and Levin was afraid her pretensewas visible . He also worried that someone might have seen them on the coast  --  Bullock and Gilley , after ducks  --  or that she might , humanly enough , say something to her roommateabout her new boy friend  --  tickle me and I 'll tell you his name  --  a bearded member of the English department , ravished by her charms . The roommate might , in moments of passion , carelessly blow about this information , till it landed in ProfessorFairchild 's lap , whose wrath Levin feared most . He wondered if the fun he had had was worth it . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreet . She had her own reputation to protect ; and supposenews of the non-paying guest got back to the aunt who owned the motel , an affront to business ? Levin learned with relief that neither Gilley nor Bullock had been out for ducks that weekend . Gerald had been on a recruitment trip to high schools in North Cascadia , while the University at Gettysburg  --  it said in the newspaper  --  was working southern pastures , practically a lost cause , since most of the kids there patrioticallyfavored the southern college . And George , according to Bucket , had been busy tutoring his athletes for the finals ; he had had them working last year 's d.o 's . Yet when Nadalee ,  |p156looking  most attractive , appeared in the instructor 's office one afternoon not long after their recent intimacy and suggested another fling before finals , Levin , clearing his throat , said he did n't think it would be a good idea until maybe the Christmas or Easter holidays . He also advised Nadalee to take next term 's English ii with another instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will meet now and again , wo n't we , Seymour ? " " Now and then , " Levin said . " We might go for walks along the river . " " She looked at him curiously . " Is something wrong ? Did I do something you did n't like ? " " Oh , no , " he said , " nothing of the sort . It 's just that we have to be very careful , I told you that . " " " Then when during Christmas will we meet ? I could find an excuse to stay on at the dorm and maybe we could go to your room sometime , or something like that if it could be arranged . " " That would be nice but I may be going to San Francisco during Christmas , " Levin said . " Oh , swell ! Would n't it be nice if we could go together ? I 'd pay my own way , of course . " He said it would be except he had promised a colleague he might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , " said Nadalee . Though they talked longer , she seemed , when she left , to have grown cool to him . He observed this with regret . He was treating her badly . A week later , two days after the English io final , she was in his office again , upset , angry , on the verge of tears . It was a dark mid-December morning , the rain blurring the wet world . She was herself drenched , her raincoat and poplin hat thoroughly wet , and Levin had hung them above the radiator , to dry . She had on a pair of tight red culottes , a white sweater that cuddled her hard little breasts , and white fur-trimmed boots on her childlike feet . Levin had serious second thoughts about the wisdom of so soon having called it quits with her ,  |p157and  even assembled a temporary plan for reclaiming her friendship , but this , on reflection , he abandoned . Yet he felt regret for the reduction , for whatever reason , of his former interest in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in love , he thought . She had come , it turned out , to protest her English grade . At her request Levin had mailed Nadalee her mark ahead of the official transcript , and she was clearly unhappy with the C she had got . She said , with moist , hurt eyes , she surely deserved at least a B and accused the instructor of having leaned over backwards in grading her . " What do you mean ? " Her voice broke . " Are n't you punishing me because you did something you should n't have ? " Levin went to the door and listened . He listened at the walls . " Please , Nadalee , keep your voice down . " She tightened her trembling lips as he , after a minute , spoke . " This I 'll say : your term mark had absolutely no connection  --  it was n't in any way influenced by my conscience , or any other feeling relative to our relationship , which I look back on with gratitude to you  --  if that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out her grade . " First of all , we 're all directed to grade the same way in comp , onethirdeach for class quiz , and theme averages , plus d.o . Now , going into the final , you had B plus in themes and only C plus in quizzes . I was hoping you 'd hit at least a B minus in the d.o .  --  I was hoping for more than that , but at least a B minus to give you a B minus average for the term , which the registrar records as a straight B because he does n't  --  as I understand it  --  like to monkey with plus or minuses because that means more clerical help . Anyway , to my deep disappointment  --  and I 'm very sincere about it  --  you pulled a D for some strange reason , and that made your average C plus for the term , which is what I gave you , and that was the reason for the registrar 's C. I will also admit I considered raising you to a B anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of gratitude to you . But the truth ofp158it is that what happened to us , as you must understand , has no connection with your grade and I ca n't give it any . I thought it would n't be fair to mark you on one standard and everyone else on another . Do you see what I mean , Nadalee ? " She gave up her struggle to conceal contempt . " I see there were things you could bring yourself to do when they suited you . " Levin was shaken . " If that 's honestly so , and there was nothing more to it than that , then I regret it . " She began to cry . She sat in the visitor 's chair and wept in her hands . He pulled a tissue out of his drawer but she would n't take it . " I had the curse when I took that final . I never do well then . " " I 'm sorry , Nadalee . " " You do n't know how much this means to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she dried her reddened eyes and renewed her lips . Though he was tempted to ask her not to say or do anything rash , he managed not to . When she left she had regained a certain composure , but not Levin . IIe was uncomfortable for hours in bed that night , trying to decide what to do . Had he marked her fairly ? Possibly he had gone off a bit in grading her work in class , yet that might have been to her advantage as well as not . On the other hand , since she was a better than average writer in a comp course , why not raise the C plus to a B minus and let it go at that ? Damn the small difference . He would not swear in the light of eternity and/or Second Law of Thermodynamics that his B minus meant a better performance than his C plus . Who was Gilley with his iron law of grade averages , God almighty ? Bullock had once said in the coffee room that he tended to upgrade the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , was inclined to favor a petitioner . A student could arouse his sympathy by saying , " Look , Mr. Levin , I 'm working extra hard this term . I have reformed and hope you 'll notice it . " Or byp159telling him his father had recently died and the widowed mother was entirely dependent on the son 's grades . If his " objectivity " had been influenced before , why not now for her who had slept with him ? He owed her more than he had owed the others . I ca n't , he thought , as he stared out into the wet night . It 's the principle of it . He had resolved nothing . When he managed to fall asleep he woke after an hour and thought of what he had thought before . She appeared in his office again the next day . Her pale face was without lip rouge or eyebrow pencil ; and without perfume her body odor was bittersweet . She looked , Levin clearly saw , like no one he particularly knew , which he blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " I did n't tell you why I needed the B , because I was ashamed to . But I have to have it because I found out I have flunked my math . I need the B in English to keep from being put on probation . If that happens in my first term here , Daddy said he would make me leave and go back to the bank . He 's very strict about everything , Mr. Levin . " Now she tells me . " I ca n't do it , " Levin sighed . " Does n't how close we once were mean anything at all to you ? " Nadalee asked . " It does , but not to make me dishonest . " She looked at him bitterly . " Were n't you dishonest in sleeping with me ? " " How so ? " " To your obligations ? " " Yes . " " Then would it make you any more so to raise my grade just a teeny , to a B minus ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she flung it away , shot him a cold look , and left the office.  |p160Levin  was afraid of the worst : When her father yanked her out of college she would take him along for the ride  --  the end of his short careless career as a college instructor . Ah , if I could begin all over again , he thought . That night he was back at his desk at the office , reading through Nadalee 's d.o . Possibly in the mad rush he had made a mistake . Levin first went through her paper to see that he had n't skipped a page or marked any right answers wrong . He had n't . Then he checked the count on each page  --  correctandtotaled the eight page scores . He added them three times and got three different figures , one twenty-two points higher than that on her paper . He flung down his pencil . He hurried across the hall to Bucket , who obliged by doing the addition on Milly 's adding machine . It came out twentytwopoints higher than the original score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would easily make a B minus , giving her the B she needed . He was elated yet irritated by his carelessness . " Something wrong ? " Bucket asked . " What do you do if you 've sent the registrar a wrong grade ? " " 1 suggest you ask the secretary for a change of grade card ' and say a prayer . " " Really ? What for ? " " The registrar does n't like to change grades . " Levin , in his office , kicked himself for not having checked his additions . He took his pile of exams to Milly 's desk and sat there re-adding scores on the machine . By one A.M. he had uncovered three more errors . One was n't serious  --  did not affect the student 's letter grade ; but three of the four were . Nadalee must , of course , be raised . A veteran in her class had to go up from B to A minus ; and a girl in another section had to have her grade lowered from B to straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Friday before the vacation began , he asked Milly for three " change of grade " cards . She handedp161them to him , concerned behind her harlequin glasses . " They 're hardly ever used , Mr. Levin . " He filled them out on her desk , writing " error in addition " for " reason for change , " and then took them across the hall for Gilley 's signature . Gerald 's face slowly flushed . " For Pete 's sake , Sy , three ? Why , the registrar will go right through the roof . You have no idea of all they have to do right now . They 'll be working through Saturday and Sunday and all of next week while the rest of us are loafing on our vacations . Each of these cards means half a dozen different changes for each student . It 's a mess of clerical work , and they just ca n't spare that much time . The worst of it is it 's entirely possible this girl you want to drop to a C may already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to feel like to get notice of this change ? " Levin , his beard prickly , was apologetic . " I 'm sorry , Gerald , but a mistake is a mistake . " Gilley studied the three cards . " I 'll tell you what we could do . Why do n't you just turn in the two grade raises and never mind the other one ? The girl will have a fit if she finds out her mark has been reduced . She could make trouble not only for you but for the department . Her father or some relative might call the president 's office and the next thing you 'd be sweating on his carpet , and we 'd be hearing about it . " Levin , mopping his face , answered , " I would show him the evidence . " " It would still reflect on our good name . " " Still , " said Levin , " if two changes are going to be made , why not the third ? It 's only logical . " After reflecting another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beet , glumly gave in . " But for crying in the sink , be careful in the future . " Levin promised and hastily left . Later he telephoned Nadaleeand told her about his error . " You mean I had B minus all the while ? "  |p162He  admitted it . " Then thanks for nothing . " She hung up hard but he felt comparatively clear in conscience . During the long winter vacation it rained continuously , the sky a low thick motionless raincloud , the warmish wet-cold season without dry corner . After daylong rain it rained all night , the dark , liquescent , dripping from trees . When he woke in the night to heft his life , he listened to the rain as natural history , the Pacific extending itself over the land . Huge soppingclouds floated over breakers threading the beaches and struck against mountainsides , rain pouring from an armada of smashed hulls , drenching the craggy crawling forests , drowninggreen hills black , soaking the grasslit fields . In the dark Levin remembered the rain of his childhood , blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafless backyard tree in foaming bursts ; but when it had ended  --  after a day , three , a week  --  it had ended and enter light , the worshipful sun . Here was no sense of being between rains ; it was a climate , a condition , the water burbling , thick , thin , fine , ubiquitous , continuous , monotonous , formless . Once in a while he saw two rainbows in the same sky but after rainbows it rained . Wherever Levin went he went in rubbers , raincoat , umbrella ; the only other man he saw with an umbrella was Professor Fairchild . Students stood bareheaded in the pelting rain , talkingleisurely , even opening a book to prove a point . Meanwhile Levin had grown neither fins nor duckfeathers ; nor armorplate against loneliness . Bullock had invited him to drive to San Francisco with him , Jeannette , and the kids , and Levin was willing , but at the last minute George had to change his plans . Levin considered attempting the drive  --  for experience  --  in his Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every mountain top , being stuck in innumerable ditches , breaking down in snow , having to be towed and repaired until he was bankrupt.  |p163So  he stayed home without much to do , though there were one or two little invitations , and he was looking forward to Bullock 's apparently annual New Year 's Eve shindig that Geraldhad been rubbing his hands over . He read a lot , sometimes putting down his book to think of Nadalee , often with desire . One night he went to the tavern to see if Laverne was there but she had quit . He thought of the barn with nostalgia . The new waitress did not interest him so he left after one beer . During the week he visited Millard Scowers and O. E. Jones , and on Christmas night saw four hundred of Dr. Kuck 's color slides . All eight Buckets  --  he had phoned several times and knocked on their door twice  --  had apparently left town . Levin thought of telephoning Avis but remembered her operation . The town had little to offer of entertainment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign film . The next day he drove two hundred , coming and going , to inspect the University at Gettysburg . While in the art gallery there , he bowed his head for the return of the liberal arts to Cascadia College . In the evening he searched the pages of the Easchester Commercial Budget for some local cultural event to attend , but what were Zonta , Daughters of the Nile , Men 's Loyalty Club ? He was too young for Let 's Be Forty but considered dropping in at a meeting of You and Me because he had heard boy met girl there . Before he could go , Levin was sick in bed . He had caught a miserable cold . His throat burned , sour nose dripped , head ached , and he sneezed in bunches . Sleep was hard to come by ; when he dozed , his raspy breathing woke him . Bullock called to say Jeannette had the flu and they were canceling out for New Year 's . Levin felt himself grow depressed . He thought of Nadalee endlessly , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mean way to win a lay . His escape to the West had thus far come to nothing , space corrupted by time , the past-contaminated self . Mold memories , bad habit , worse luck . He recalled in dirty detail each disgusting defeat from boyhood , his weaknesses , impoverishment , undiscipline  --  the limp self entangled in the fabricp164of a will-less life . A white-eyed hound bayed at him from the window  --  his classic fear , failure after grimy years to master himself . He lay in silence , solitude , and darkness . More than once he experienced crawling self-hatred . It left him frightenedbecause he thought he had outdistanced it by three thousandmiles . The future as new life was no longer predictable . That caused the floor to move under his bed . Levin fell into sadness , an old kind ; this lonely man rememberingthis lonely man in the dark of a dirty room . So it went for ages , too long to think about . After came apathy ; a rock with a cold in the head lay in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of shrieking ; in iron desperation he concentrated on the sad golden beauty of a fifth of whiskey . The vision made him terribly thirsty . He reached for a bottle and found himself staring into a pair of brown eyes . Levin shuddered , no one had entered , was he already drunk ? Then he saw Pauline Gilley watching him through the glass top of the back door , something like pity in her eyes . When she knocked , he craftily kept his mouth shut , but she had turned the knob and was already breathlessly in the room , naming , as she placed them on the table , what she had brought him : " Nosedrops , anti-histamine , vitamin C , a lemon for your tea , and some oranges and cookies . Excuse me for coming in the back way , but Gerald said Mrs. Beatty naps in the afternoon , and I did n't want to ring the bell . " She had removed her coat and was unknotting the black scarf on her head . Talking all the while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened the papers on his desk , sayingas though it mattered she would have come before but Gerald had n't told her until today that Levin was sick . " I had asked about you and he said George had said you had a bad cold . I 'm terribly sorry . " He answered nothing , beard clotted , hair matted with sweat , the sick waste of a man . Whatever she thought she must do , let her do it and go . Then she was sitting in a chair by his bed , facing the messp165he was , knitting an obscene gray sock . " I wish you had phoned me . " Her voice was at times inaudible . It made no difference . " There 's no need for you to be alone when you 're sick . My father used to say that did more harm than the illness . Would you like me to read to you ? I 've brought The Woodlanders , a book I like very much . " He waited with shut eyes for her to go . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he heard , as he stared at the ceiling , the click of her knitting needles . When the sound was gone she would be . He waited for that so he could take up his thirst . " The children are n't our own , " she was saying . " We adopted little Mary last year and Erik the year before , after being childless since we were married . " Levin waited with cunning patience and after long silence she put away the needles and got up . The rain had stopped . Under golden clouds the setting sun flooded the room . In the light she was knotting her scarf and then he no longer saw her . Afterwards his nose bled and he could smell the lemon and oranges she had left . Levin got up and dressed . He pulled on rubbers but omitted the umbrella . Going out the back way , he walked along wet streets , sunlight glistening on the branches of black-trunked trees , to where the houses ended and he could see the sunsetover the fields . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . Clouds in surprising shapes and colors floated over his head . One looked like a fat red salmon . Another was a purple flower . One was a golden-breasted torso out of Rubens . His thirst was gone ; everything was wet , trees , puddledroads , the grassy evening earth . His misery had exhaled itself . He was once more the improved Levin . It was that goddamned cold , he thought . If I had kept that in mind I could have saved myself pain . He regretted not having said a kind word to her ; but he felt like a man entering a new life and entered.  |p166He  returned to class still dissatisfied with his teaching . English ii , " more a college course , " Gilley had described it , though an improvement over last term 's course , still dependedtoo heavily on The Elements . Sometimes Levin interrupteddrill in Workbook Form B , to speak of a good novel or read aloud a poem , the only poem some of them would hear in college , possibly in their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . But since that was irrelevant to the subject matter of the curriculum , he felt uneasy . Who am I anyway , the fourth Isaiah ? And he failed more papers than he had last term . He lectured his students for the thinness of their themes , for their pleasant good-natured selves without a critical attitude to life . Then he was consciencestrickenfor not patiently teaching . A few people disappeared from his classes . When he got their withdrawal slips he assumed they had dropped English or left college , until he learned they had been in to see Gilley , who had arranged their transfer to other comp courses . Gerald admitted this to Levin once when they were alone in the coffee room . " Better take it easy , Sy . These kids have every right to be treated with respect . " " That they have , " said Levin , secretly incensed , "  --  to be respected as people . But do n't they have to earn my respect for their work ? " " You ca n't go lecturing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " Would n't it  --  cr  --  have been better if you had advised them to stay with me ? Since the issue was the quality of their work , if you transfer them out of my classes , are n't you really kicking my standards in the pants ? Maybe you should have asked them to talk to me first ? " Gilley rinsed his cup . " My experience is that once a student has no further use for his instructor the best thing is to separate them both . " Though Levin denied the worth of the tactic , the loss of his students confirmed his fear he was n't teaching well.  |p167One  wet January day , with Professor Fairchild present , sucking his yellowed ivory cigarette holder , Gilley convened a meeting of the composition staff to discuss the increase in plagiarized papers . Since October , the director of composition said , Avis had turned in three clinkers , he had lit on one , Farper one , and now Jones thought he had another . Gilley was sure others , as yet undetected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions , and consultation with colleagues if any seemed suspect . Avis had a flair for spotting work that had been copied . " Try her , Dr. Kuck , or me , " he said . " Though the comp room does a good job of holding down the number of cribbed papers , some do get by us . If you suspect a theme  --  if it hits your eye wrong  --  that 's a sure sign to watch out . If you ca n't spot its source right off , as I say , bring it to one of us . I 've nailed quite a few of these tin potatoes in my time and will be glad to help you . " Levin asked what happened to a student who got caught . Professor Fairchild removed his cigarette holder to reply , but Gilley spoke first . " Once we have certain proof , or a confession , the student is brought before the Student Dishonesty Committee . His or her instructor and I are the complainants , and he or she is advised as to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually he or she fails English and is suspendedfrom college for the rest of the term . If the case is very serious  --  if we have proof and he or she wo n't confess  --  we may expel him or her . Professor Fairchild , nodding between puffs , added , " That 's right . And once you 've got a clear-cut case of cribbing , do n't take the responsibility on yourself for judging or not judging guilt . Avoid false pity and turn the guilty one in to either Dr. Gilley or me . Preferably Dr. Gilley . It 's the only way to stamp out this thing . " " That 's right , " Gilley said , but the old professor , with a chuckle , had begun a story : " About a year after I 'd come here "  --  he scratched his eyebrow with one finger  --  " I guess it was closer to five , but no matter . At any rate , I had in one of myp168classes a boy I rather liked . I thought he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once as part of a magazine article I had recently read . You know , I had a chat with this young fellow  --  he came from a good family and readilyadmitted his error . He said he had been loaded down with engineering studies and had n't any time left to do his English . " I said that I 'd forgive him his first offense and not take any drastic measures if he would turn in a makeup paper that same day . He did , that afternoon . It was a good paper . The boy was a competent writer  --  I knew that from a previous theme he had written in class , and I think I gave his makeup paper a grade of B or B plus , most likely B. But something about it did n't quite sit right with me . I woke up out of a sound after-lunch nap and began to wonder about the second paper . Something smelled fishy in Denmark . I spoke to Dr. Femur , in political science  --  he retired after we lost liberal arts degrees  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition in an address by Theodore Roosevelt . I immediatelywrote the boy 's father , a successful shoe merchant , who came from Portland , Oregon , to see me . We had what amounted to an emotional session . The young man , in tears , swore on my wife 's Bible that it would never happen again . I took his word , and so , may I add , did his father . " Well , the boy handed in a third paper , but I was forewarned , and forewarned is forearmed . I asked Dr. Fabrikant  --  I think it was Fabrikant  --  " he looked around the room but Dr. Fabrikant was not present "  --  to read it over . He gave me the clue I needed and I located most of the contents of the third paper in the writings of John Stuart Mill . Needless to say , the boy was expelled from college . As an amusing postscript , I will add that the father wrote me an angry letter , in which he doubted my competence as a professor because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or B plus , whichever it was . " He laughed to himself . " I cite this little story to show how they will take advantage of your good will , Mr. Levin , if youp169are n't alert and on guard . I 've been hard to fool since then . " The meeting broke up , Levin pleasantly excited . With him , to name an evil was to encounter it . In a few days he read a theme he was suspicious of . His suspicions made him nervous because one of his own painful memories was of cheating on a math final in college ; he had copied from a paper a friend had slipped him  --  at Levin 's request . But the instructor felt he had the right to judge his own students ' honesty . It was the way of society : the reformed judging the unreformed . Better that than the other way around . He compared the paper to two others the boy had written , one in class at the start of the winter term . The theme in question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Own House and Like It . " Levin found this paper to be without any of the writer 's usual weaknesses of structure and content , and with a kind of humor he had n't encountered in his previous work . As a matter of fact , it was unusually good . The author of the paper , Albert O. Birdless , nineteen , from Marathon , Cascadia , was majoring in vocational education . His build reminded Levin of a young tugboat . He was stocky , with a short neck , heavy shoulders and legs , and stubby feet in square-toed shoes . His longish crewcut appeared to have gone to seed . On his head he usually wore a freshman beanie . Birdless was the exception to the almost universal rule of cordiality on the campus ; his eyes were blue unsmiling marbles . He was a writer of less than average skill who did not attempt to hide from Levin his opinion that composition was a waste of time . Since he sat in the last row it may have seemed to him that Levin paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and sneaked off a quick catnap during the hour . Levin had by now got over feeling very much annoyed with those who fell asleep on him ; yet he had once or twice with a look tried to get Albert to resist boredom , and Albert had flushed and turned away . As he began to snooze one morning after a poor recitation , Levin asked him to snap out of it . Hep170was then annoyed by the boy 's scowl as he shifted his shoulders and reluctantly sat up , but the instructor suppressed a wisecrack and the incident was over . Later , passing each other in the hall , they exchanged cold glances . To some extent this bothered Levin , for there was little enough good feeling in the world and he did not like to add to the bad . Yet it seemed to him that those you chose to dislike had by some rule of economyin nature chosen you , so that narrowed ill-feeling . Albert 's average was a solid D plus when he handed in his spectacular theme . Although Levin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper he considered giving it an A under a remark that the improvement was miraculous and would he do the same next time they were writing a theme in class . But he was angered at the boy for trying to pull this on him . O. E. Jones , who had given Albert a D last term , shook his head over this paper . After some hesitation , Levin handed it to Gilley , who took in page one in a swoop , and said with a throb in his voice , " No doubt about it , Sy , this is a professional job . You 've caught a rat . " Levin 's throat went dry . " Are you sure ? Where would it be from ? " Gilley , leaning hack in his chair , reflected , one eye aimed at the ceiling . " I guess some place like Reader 's Digest or Coronet . Also try American Home and one or two of that kind . Just thumb through the back issues of the last couple of years . Freshmen , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only so far that the instructor is n't likely to pick up that same issue in the dentist 's office . I do n't think you 'll have much trouble locating it . " " Should I ask him about it first  --  if he did crib it ? " " I have no doubt he did but I leave that up to you . Some ask questions first . Some would rather not until they have the evidence . Avis has a knack of going straight to the Readers Guide , looking over the titles of articles on the cribbed subject for a couple of years past or so , and just about right awayp171putting her finger on the one she needs . Her last incident she had this student nailed dead to rights an hour and a half after she read his theme . We had him suspended by his dean and off the campus before five o'clock of the same day . " After class the next morning , Levin , still uneasy , asked Albert to drop into his office during the afternoon . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you come in . " " Okay . " He popped on his beanie and left . He did n't show up till after five . Levin had his coat on but sat down . " Anything wrong  --  sir ? " " Would you mind taking off your cap ? " " Yes , sir . " He was able to look at Levin without meeting his eyes . Levin asked him to have a seat . Albert , placing his books on the desk , sat on the edge of the chair . When he thought about it he sat back and crossed his well packed thighs . " Could I smoke ? " " Yes . " But he was out of cigarettes and Levin had none to offer him . " I 'll make it short , " he said . " This last theme you gave me  --  this on my desk  --  is a very skillful job . It 's so much better than anything you 've so far handed in that I have to ask you if it 's your own work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at his theme . " You were n't helped by somebody , directly or indirectly ? " " Who says so ? " " Some students do n't quite understand where citation ends and cribbing begins . Sometimes they will copy material from a magazine or book and forget to acknowledge the source . Did you happen to do something like that ? " " Every word on that paper came out of my own head , " Albert said.  | " Every word ? " " Some came out of the dictionary . " Levin nervously stroked his beard . " But how do you account for such an unusual improvement in your writing ? Usually  --  you have to admit , and this holds for your last term 's themes which I 've also looked at  --  you have at least one sentence fragmentin every paper . Your ideas are presented with difficulty and without humor , whereas in this everything is lucid and the humor is really funny . Your paragraphs , Albert , if you do n't mind my saying so , are generally badly built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic sentence , in the rare cases where you have one . Your first two themes , with indulgence , came to D. This , though , is a first-rate A. Suppose you were the instructor , what would you think ? " " If you do n't write so good , that does n't mean you 're a failure . " " I never said so . All I ask is how you can explain this practicallyflawless piece of work ? " He handed Albert the paper . The student opened his mouth to let in air . His voice was emotional . " I worked twelve hours on that one theme . Is n't a guy entitled to a good grade once in a while ? It just so happensI know about house construction . This last summer I helped my uncle who 's a builder . And if this one sounds so funny that 's because there are some things that happen to be funny , so why should n't I write that way ? " He was staring with a wet-lipped grin at Levin 's hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess that 's all . " Albert was also on his feet . " I bet you do n't believe me . " " In this case I frankly do n't see how I can . This paper is thework of an educated man . " " There 's more than one way to be educated . " " This is educated in only one way . " " So you think I 'm lying ? " " I do n't think you 're telling the whole truth . " " That 's what I thought , " Albert said sullenly . " I know damn well you never did like me . I 'm not the only one that has yourp173number . There are a lot of other guys who do n't like your class . " " You 've taken a poll ? " Levin inquired . " I hear people talking . They say you never give anybody a break . " Levin denied it but Albert did not stay to hear . The instructor could hardly wait to get to the library , after supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hand trembled as he thumbed through a volume of magazines . Findingnothing that night , he returned the next morning during a free hour . Albert sat at a nearby table , watching Levin over the top of an open book that covered his face to the eyes . Levin imagined a disembodied smirk hanging behind the book . Once or twice his heart raced as he thought he had the article , but it turned out no . The third day , impatient to get the unpleasant job done with , he gave the whole afternoon to the search . Nothing doing . Every night that week he read in the main reading room , adding other periodicals to those Gilleyhad suggested . Albert was almost always present in the vicinity , sitting behind a stack of books around which he peered from time to time , a sight Levin , to his surprise , found mildly pleasurable . Yet he was annoyed at all the time this was taking , angered that Albert knew what he wanted to know and so far could n't . Amazing how denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twice Gilley came over to lend a hand ; and Avis , now wearing bangs , although still cold to Levin  --  he had heard from Gerald the poor breast had been successfully operated on  --  pitched in for a full evening , together with Dr. Kuck . Though there were occasions they all felt they were approaching a definitive find , nothing came of it . One night after closing , as Levin was going down the stone steps of the library , Albert , a few steps behind , made a noise that even in Cascadia sounded like a Bronx cheer . Levin ground his teeth . He extended his efforts , despite papers to grade and his ownp174reading piling up ; giving every spare minute to the hunt , and some not so spare , devouring volumes of up to fifteen years ago . He read with murderous intent , to ensnare and expunge Albert O. Birdless . Levin saw himself as a man-eating shark cleaving with the speed of a locomotive through a thick sea of words , Albert , a tricky fat eel hidden among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alphabet soup . Levin , in fast pursuit , caught nothing in his toothy mouth and began to doubt he would catch anything . But Gilley cheered him on , though by now Levin was playing with the idea that Albert 's theme had been the work of a talented friend , although how he would rate such a friend was a question . Gerald poohpoohedthe possibility . In class Levin had given up calling on Albert , even avoided looking in his direction . Then one morning , about ten days after Levin had read the allegedly plagiarized theme , happening to meet the boy 's eyes , the instructor saw they were soiled with worry , and his face had taken on a yellowish cast . Levin felt bad : lie had created a victim . Albert might be guilty ; if so he had got to where his guilt , by some trick of human drama , rubbed off on his prosecutor . Levin had n't the heart to go to the library that day . He sat in his office trying to decide what to do . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levin , though almost positive he had n't written the theme , could n't prove it . Not having been able to prove it in a reasonable time  --  reasonable defined by the state of Albert 's sagging nervous system , not to mention ten wasted days for Levin  --  was n't it better to drop the whole business ? He could forever go on investigating and finding nothing , creating a perpetual indictment . I 've got to be quick with a reasonable doubt . He was n't excusing Albert but had to stop torturing him . Levin decided to call it quits . He considered reducing the theme grade to C but could n't logically . It was , as a paper , worth A , and once he dropped the matter , A is what it wouldp175get . Albert would recover his contentment , but it was his contentment . Levin made up his mind over the weekend . On Monday he called the boy to his desk after class . Albert popped on his lid as he approached . He stood near the desk , dully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His breathing was heavy , his breath bad . Levin spoke through a constricted throat . " Albert , I have n't been able to prove your composition was copied so I have to assume you 're innocent . Still , if you 're really not , maybe you ought to say so ? If you admit it , I 'll drop you from the course without a grade . If you do n't I 'm forgetting the matter anyway , and you can stay on in the class without prejudice . The theme will go down for an A. " Albert 's eyes were lusterless , as a smirk , a skull and crossbonesrising on a tugboat 's halyard , by degrees took possession of his face . " I have no confession at all to make , " he said in a quavering voice . " You tried to make a damn fool out of me and made one out of yourself instead . " He was about to cry and turned not to be seen , but Levin , unable to confront his image in Albert 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , until Gilley , seeing him in the hall , called Levin into his office . " How 's it going , Sy ? " " What ? " " The paper Birdless cribbed . How are you coming along on that ? " " Oh that , " Levin said , scratching his cheek through his whiskers , " I could n't prove anything so I dropped it . " " What ! " said Gilley . " Dropped it ? " " I could n't prove anything , " Levin explained . " The boy was punch-drunk and turning yellow  --  his skin , I mean . I thought I 'd better drop it . "  | " If he looked guilty , " Gilley fidgeted , " that 's because he was . He should have been tracked down and exposed . " " I tried , you know I did . I neglected everything else . " " In that case , why do n't you leave his paper with me and I 'll give it some more attention in a day or two ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the case is closed . " " What grade did you give him ? " " An A. " " Are you crazy ? " Gilley stared at him sternly . Levin was startled . Yet when he looked again , the director of composition was smiling . " Sy , do you remember what Professor Fairchild told us all in the last monthly meeting ? About the procedure to be followed in a case of this kind ? " " Was n't it in a different context , " Levin asked , " referring to what to do after guilt was proved ? I did n't prove anything . " " He said to avoid false pity and stamp this thing out . You and I know that boy is guilty . He should have been nailed or he 'll do it again . I wonder if you have any idea what we 're up against in cheating these days ? Not only cribbed papers but all kinds of cheating . Students break into offices for exams . They steal Milly 's wastebasket regularly to see if there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had to change her lock twice this year . They cheat by every means you can think of . Girls pin notes under their skirts which they modestly lower when a proctor comes along . They hide answersin their brassieres . Some of the boys come with sentences diagrammed on their palms and definitions printed all the way up their arms . They keep notes in their cuffs and socks . One kid even had a kind of invisible ink he used to write with on his shirt cuffs , and a pair of dark glasses he could see the writing with . It 's a regular industry and the only way to lick it is to stamp it out without mercy wherever we find it . " Levin agreed . " Still , if you 'll pardon my saying this , Gerald , is n't it  --  er  --  partly our fault ? I 've never heard so much talk about grades as I have around here  --  including the coffee room.  |p177It  's as though grades is what everybody graduates to after batting averages . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into complaining about the grading system . We have to have standards . And I 'll bet you 'll find just as much cheating in the liberal arts colleges as we have here . Let 's stick to Birdless ' paper . " " When I saw how he was beginning to look , " Levin said , " I said to myself a good teacher is a liberator . " " Sure , but let 's be relevant . You ca n't liberate a thief . Once you do he 'll steal again . That was pretty clear from the story Orville told us . That boy cribbed three times in a row . If they did n't throw him out he 'd still be doing it . " " I said to myself , You ca n't indict without evidence , and you ca n't indict in perpetuity . " " You could have got the evidence . " " I tried very hard . " " All this disturbs me . " " It disturbs me too . " " Then why do n't you let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the job ? " " No , I could n't do that . " Levin excused himself and left . An hour later he met Gilley , in good humor , in the men 's room . " Sy , " he said , " something a lot more pleasant . Pauline asked me to invite you to dinner for Friday night . Can you make it ? " Levin tried to think of a way out but could n't and accepted . " Fine , I 'll tell her . By the way , I 've transferred Birdless out of your class . Avis agreed to take him . You 'll get the drop notice in a day or so . " Levin , shaking in his clothes , tried to steady his voice . " Did you  --  ah  --  transfer him to get at his theme ? " " No , " said Gilley , rubbing his hands with a paper towel , " he came in and asked to be taken out of your class . I did it because , as I said before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and instructors . "  | " Do n't you see , " Levin said , " you are destroying my author-ity ? " " Now take it easy , Sy . I 've done nothing of the kind . I respectyour point of view but it 's psychologically a bad thing to have a kid in the class of an instructor he says he hates . The student shows his disrespect in his attitude . He might spread all kinds of rumors or lies about you and it would be bad for class morale . You 're well rid of a troublemaker . " This man is my enemy , Levin thought . He laughed brokenly.  |p181At  the Bullocks ' for cocktails Levin wandered restlessly from one group to another . He listened for a minute with half an ear , then moved on , wondering what he thought he might find in one bunch that he would n't in the next . The house was a stylish split-level on a fashionable western hill , whose large wood-paneled living room could hold thirty without trying and did this Sunday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exception of Avis there was n't an unmarried woman around , and Levin thought that grim fact accounted for his dullish mood . People were pairing him off with her , he had noticed , and this explained , he thought , his recent popularity , if not with Avis . The beard seemed to help , making him in some people 's eyes a person he was n't . They could have it . After a short stretch in the garden at sunset , Levin , a mouthful of martini held aimlessly in his hand , sat on the sofap182between Alma Kuck and Jeannette Bullock , Alma again going on about the British Isles , and Jeannette deathlessly attentive , that rare thing , a beautiful woman who managed to be uninteresting . Pauline said she had never got over the fact she had n't been to college . Levin noticed that although her legs attracted wherever she sat , she spent five minutes trying to hide them under her skirts , a pity . But she had constructed a lovely garden amid the oaks and fir trees on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card on his birthday . As Alma talked and Jeannette listened , Levin , escaping from a yawn , had both eyes on Pauline Gilley across the room , standingpartly turned from him amid some of the younger wives . She was attractive in a tight black dress . A small veil floating before her eyes from a wisp of hat created a mystery where none had been before . Who was the masked lady ? Amazing what entices , Levin thought . Yet when she happened to glance in his direction , her thin-stemmed martini glass like a flower in her fingers , he pretended to be inspecting his new brown shoes . Secretly he continued to watch her . Alma diverted him with a question , and when he got up a minute later and went to Pauline she was gone . Bullock appeared with his flowing pitcher , dispensing a boffo with every shot . The contents looked like innocent water but packed a hard wallop . People at the party were gay , they enjoyed Bullock 's daring pitcher , a departure from the town 's mores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty houses . To dance , Levin had been told , one usually joined a social dancing club . There were dances the last Friday of each month , with extras for holidays . If Professor Fairchild or exDeanFeeney was present at a party , soft drinks and sweet green punch prevailed , but none of the older people having been invited , the host freely poured firewater , an empty glass seeming to threaten his security . Surprising the instructor without a glass , Bullock handed him one and aimed the spout , but Levin , worried by the man 's unthinking prodigality , said he had had enough.  | " I thought this was a party , " George said . When he was drinking he breathed through a half-open mouth , both eyes verging on vacant . But a sweetness descended on him , and he loved on Sundays those he tolerated weekdays . Levin felt that neither of them took to the other . Bullock invited him because he sensed Levin disliked him , and he came because he could n't afford to turn down an invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked , nor were they ever present at Bullock 's . " It is , " answered Levin , " but I 've already had two . " " That was my last batch . This will dissolve the rust on your gonads , if not the gonads . Have three . " Figuring he would abandon the glass , Levin let him fill it . " Nice party . " George blinked . " Think so ? We were late getting off the ground this fall . By now we 've usually had three or four big blasts , but Jeannette has n't been up to it lately  --  flu plus miscarriage ( keep it quiet ) et cetera . I also blame the late godawfulfootball season , let it rest . There 's nothing like a consistentlylosing team to put a damper on your entertaining instinct . It depressed Gerald too . " " Is that so ? " " Yep . Everybody expected a bang-up season . Look predicted a possible Rose Bowl for us , then the roof caved in . We won three out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The alumni are sore as hell at Lon Lewis , the head coach , and he 'll probably be traded for somebody with a T-formation . I know most of the boys on the squad and I 'll tell you it was no inspiration to see their hangdog pusses in class on Monday mornings . " " They 're all in your classes ? " " Some are . They have their free choice of instructors . " " I did n't mean they did n't  --  " " Anyway , " Bullock said , " exit football , enter basketball . We 've copped the first four games and look like a shoo-in to take the coast conference . Bought your season ticket ? "  | " No , " said Levin . " Tough titty . Keep it in mind for next year . Saves you thirty percent . To the future champs . " He raised his , right hand , crossing fingers . Levin lifted his glass . Remembering the red bumper-strip on Bullock 's station wagon : " Keep Basketball King at Cascadia College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin . He had visions of being picked up drunk in town and fined a hundred dollars and costs . " Gerald is also affected by a losing team ? " Levin asked . " After some of the rough ones he ca n't talk for an hour . " " Really ? Pauline too ? " " She has her moments . Jeannette gets listless . " " Is that why the Gilleys did n't entertain much this fall ? " " It would n't surprise me . They like to have people in after a game but did n't do any of that after the shellacking we got from Cal , right off . He 's the fan , though she keeps him pretty steady company at the big games . Both she and Jeannette say sports take their minds off their worries , whatever the hell they are . Pauline can he a moody dame , and I suppose having two kids all of a sudden is no picnic . Gerald did some lousy duck shooting in December . I 've never seen him so bad . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? " Bullock winked . " I did n't say so but she helps , though last year the kids ' colds knocked them both for a loop . Erik gets everything in the book plus some unidentified bugs . That was on top of the fact that Gerald had n't recovered from L'affaire Duffy , the year before . " " It was that bad ? " " He bore the brunt for more than one reason , one being that Orville folds up his tent and goes home at the first sniff of scandal . " " It was really a scandal ? " " It amounted to one . Excuse me , " George said , " the place is going dry . " He lifted the spout but Levin withdrew his glass.  | " Before you go , " he said to Bullock , " have you seen where Pauline went ? " George looked vacantly around . " Try the upstairs bedroom . When she gets high she sometimes lies down . " Levin searched the bedrooms and daylight basement but she was n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He headed for the kitchen , slipped behind some people , and sliding open the opaque glass door , walked down six steps to the patio . Levin sighed at the stars and was at once unexpectedly emotional . An odor of flowers assailed him . Because of the season he thought it was pure imagination , the result of more liquor than he should have had . I 'm back in summer , Levin thought , or that far forward , why nobody knows . But he knew that even if he were living in another time he would be wishing for another time . The view in the dark , stars through barebranchedoaks , and the lights of the town below affected him as though he were listening to music . For the first time in years he thirsted for a butt . Smelling smoke , he looked abruptly around . In the dim light reflected from the interior of the house he made out Pauline Gilley standing between fir trees with a cigarette in her hand . " Did I frighten you , Mr. Levin ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn to her . " I was looking for you , Mrs. Gilley . " He told her he felt bad about that time she had come to see him . " Excuse me , I was sick . " " Do n't you like me ? " Pauline asked . Her scent in the cool air was warm . He wished he could see her eyes through the veil . " On the contrary  --  " She waited. "  --  I like you , " Levin said.  | " Then why did n't you come to dinner Friday night ? " He nervously fingered his beard . " Would you  --  er  --  keep it confidential ? " " I 'm awfully good at that . " " Gerald and I had a disagreement and , frankly , I did n't feel like accepting his hospitality just then . " " It was my hospitality too . " He admitted it . " What were you annoyed with Gerald about ? " " I would rather not say , some department thing . " She dropped her cigarette in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . Now I 'm dizzy again . " He was eager to help . " Can I do something for you ? " She said in a throaty voice , " I should never let George get near me when he 's loose with that pitcher . I ca n't keep track of how many I 've had because he refills after every mouthful . " " For the sport ? " She gazed at the house . " Does n't it look like a ship from here , and here we are , you and I , on an island in the middle of the sea ? Or am I high ? Are you ? " " I 'm not . " " Excuse me for mentioning it but have you graduated to cocktails ? The night we met , you would n't have one . " " Just a sip or two for sociability . I 'm always saying no . " " Why ? " " Habit . " " What do you do for sin , Mr. Levin ? " Levin guffawed but came to quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of Easchester . " I should be home now , little Mary was running a temperature when we left , and I know Erik will have somethingby tomorrow . Have you seen Gerald ? " " No , " said Levin . " Why do n't you stay a little longer ? " " Should I ? " " There 's a bench in the rock garden . " " Just for a short while , I have to get back to my children . Ip187told Zenamae to have them tucked in by seven-thirty but I know they wo n't be . Erik gets up after he 's been put down and goes exploring . " He was surprised , as he followed her across the patio , at her figure from the rear , so much better than he had noticed . The tight dress helped . Her shoulders , long waist and can were very good . Although a bit unsteady she walked with grace . Where were my eyes ? Levin thought . " Do n't be surprised if I fall , " said Pauline . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led her to the wooden bench in the rock garden . They sat in the dark , tall trees behind them . " You look cold . " He offered his jacket . " I 'll get my coat . " " I 'll get it , " Levin said . " You stay here . " " You wo n't know where it is . I 'll be right back , you wo n't lose me , Mr. Levin , " Pauline laughed . She walked across the grass as though concentrating on not falling . Five minutes later Levin was certain she would n't return . He was staring glumly at the stars as she came across the lawn with a coat over her shoulders . " I 'd 've brought yours if I knew where it was , " she said . " Why do n't you go in and get it ? I would n't want you to catch another cold . " " I 've had this winter 's cold . " " Do you plan everything , Mr. Levin ? " " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not much . " " Is that so ? " She touched his beard . " Does it keep you warm ? " She 's high for sure , Levin thought . The veil irritated him . It hid as much as it revealed . " I did have another drink , " Pauline said . " George sneaked up on me when I was inside . I was feeling better and my defenses were down . I hope I 'm not really drunk , Mr. Levin ,  |p188because  when I am I get sick . I do n't want to be sick , please . " " Sit here till you feel better . " " My impression of your whiskers that day we met  --  it was my fault we were late , I was trying to get up my nerve to meet somebody new , would you guess that ?  --  was they were coal black . But they 're really a dark shade of brown . Do you know that beards bring out the quality of a man 's lips and eyes ? You have sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew it in a time of doubt , " confessed Levin . " When I could n't look myself in the face . " " Should I become a bearded lady ? Unless this veil does the trick . Does it hide me ? At least my beastly nose ? " " Ah , but you 're a lovely woman . " " How sweet of you . I 'm not really lovely but I grow on people . I 'd be nicer if I were less superficial and more accomplished . Oh , there 's Gerald . " The glass door had opened and Gilley appeared on the veranda above the patio . He stood there for a wavering minute , a red-headed owl peering into the dark . Levin sat silent , on the verge of disappointment . But Gilley , probably affected by Bullock 's powerful pitcher , blinked without seeing them although staring in their directionHe disappeared into the house . They were motionless until she spoke . I 'll have to go now . Gerald wants me . " Pauline got up but unsteadily sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you feel better . " A light went on in an upstairs room . It went out , and on in another . They watched it until it was out . " What did he do that you did n't like ? " she asked . " It was n't important . " " I 'll bet it was . " Levin shrugged . She did not pursue it . After a while she said , " I remember your saying , the night we met , that you hoped to make better use of your life here . Have you ? "  | " It 's what one always has to do . " " Tell me what you want from life ? " " Order , value , accomplishment , love , " said Levin . " Love last ? " " Love any time . " " Pardon me for asking , but are you unhappy , Mr. Levin ? " ' Why that question ? " " That day I came to see you  --  " " Not as I have in the past known unhappiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you ? " Pauline smiled . " I too am conscious of the misuses of my life , how quickly it goes and how little I do . I want more from myself than I get , probably than I 've got . Are we misfits , Mr. Levin ? " Looking at her veil he thought , Take it off . " Gerald suffers from my nature , " she said , " though he 's a patient man . With a woman more satisfied with herself , less critical and more appreciative of his good qualities , maybe he would have been a different person . " She went on half absently , " Through the years I 've known him he 's substituted a series of minor gratifications for serious substantial ones . He 's partly affected by what he thinks people expect of him , and partly he 's reacted as he has because I 've urged the opposite . Lately he 's developed an intense ambition to follow Orville in as head of the English department . " ' Was n't it always what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or so . " " Ambition is no crime . " " Not if you 're strong . " She quickly said , " I would n't want to leave the impression Gerald is weak . He is n't , Mr. Levin , I assure you . He 's always been an excellent provider , wonderful to me and the children . If you knew him better I 'm sure you 'd like him . " " I do n't dislike him . " Pauline yawned . " Excuse me , I had a restless night . "  |p190Levin  rose . " Shall we go in ? " But she sat there . " If you 're a married woman past thirty you have at that age pretty much what you 're going to have . Still , I blame myself for my compromises , and I resist the homogenization of experience and  --  if I may call it such  --  intellect . I wish I could do more for myself , I really ca n't blame Gerald for not wanting to make a career of you came out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . " " We could all do with a cause . " Pauline said , " Leo Duffy used to say , A good cause is the highest excitement ' " Levin copied it on a piece of paper and slipped it into his pocket . " People talk about him but do n't say much . Was he a friend of yours ? " He thought for a minute she would raise her veil but Pauline sat with quiet hands . " What have you heard ? " " Not much  --  that he livened things up . " " Yes , he did . Leo was different and not the slightest bit fake under any circumstances . He was serious about ideas and should have been given a fair chance to defend his . People were irritated with him because he challenged their premises . " " That I guessed . " " I had the highest regard for him . " " I have his office now . " " So I 've heard . " She gasped as they were drenched in glaring light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the end of the party . George flushes the garden with those lights . " Pauline rose , swayed in her tracks , and again had to sit down , her face so white the veil looked blacker . " I feel deathly sick . Please , Mr. Levin , call my husband before I pass out . " " Could n't I get you some coffee ? " " Just get Gerald . "  | " Let me take you in where you can lie down . " " Tell Gerald to come take me home . " Levin hurried into the house . The party was over , the room deserted except for Leopold and Alma Kuck in overcoats , talking quietly to both Bullocks . " Pauline is n't feeling so well , " Levin said . " Where 's Gerald ? " " He 'll be down in a jiffy , " George said . " She 's in the garden and wants to go home . " The Kucks left . Jeannette saw them to the door . " The dope is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairshead . I understand they both ate something that didn'tagree with them . Maybe I ought to drive her home ? " " You 're in no condition to , George , " Jeannette said . " I will . " " Do n't bother , " Levin said . " I will . " He asked George where the toilet was . " First to the left upstairs . There 's another down here if it's. for your use . " " Not for mine , " said Levin . He raced up the stairs and knocked on the bathroom door . " Gerald , this is Sy . Pauline does n't feel so well . She wants you to take her home . If you ca n't , can I ? " Gilley , after a minute , tiredly spoke . " Why do n't you do that , Sy ? This has caught me by surprise , but I 'm sure it 's something we ate last night , some Italian stuff with red peppers and olive oil . Plus too much vino . We both got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . " Levin hurried down , found his coat , and returned to the garden . George and Jeannette were there with Pauline . " I 'm awfully sorry , " she was saying . " Some food she ate , " Levin said . He helped her to her feet .. " Gerald asked me to drive you home . " She felt his beard and giggled . " For a minute I thought you were somebody else . " " Who , for instance ? " George said . " None of your business , " said Jeannette.  | " I 'm awfully sorry , Jeannette , " said Pauline . " It 's not your fault . " Levin threw Bullock a dirty look but missed . They left by way of the garden . He helped Pauline into his Hudson and quickly drove off . She rested her head against his shoulder . " How do you feel ? " Levin asked . " Awful , but sexy . Do you think George wants to seduce me , Mr. Levin ? He pours me such big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming on . " My one talent , " she said , rubbing her head against him , " only lately developed , is that I know people . I know you , Mr. Levin . " " What do you know ? " " Who you really are . And you know me , do n't you ? " " I 'm not sure . " " She sat up . " I 've told you about myself but not about my children . " " Later , " said Levin . " At first I did n't want them because I was ashamed a big girl like me could n't have her own . When we were first married I had some menstrual trouble and the doctor noticed I had a tipped womb . All along I thought that was the reason why , but years later we were both examined and it turned out Gerald had no seeds . He had had the mumps and enflamed testicles when he was twenty-two . " " I do n't want to hear about his personal troubles . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She fell asleep with her head on his shoulder and awoke when the car stopped in front of her house . Pauline sucked a mint before she got out . He attempted to hold her arm as they walked up the flagstone path to the door but she would n't let him . In the house while she was paying Zenamae she showed no signs of distress but when the girl was gone she collapsed on the sofa , her hat awry , the veil crawling up one eye . " Stay with me and hold my hand . "  |p193Her  dress had risen above her knees . The legs were exciting though the long black shoes were like stiff herrings aimed skyward . Her chest had the topography of an ironing board . " I 'm suddenly terribly hungry . Could you make me a scrambled egg , Mr. Levin ? " That goddamn veil , he thought . On impulse he tried to pluck her hat off but Pauline clasped both hands over her head . " Stop , it 's my only defense . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . Erik called , " Mommy . " " Mr. Levin , " said Pauline , " I entreat you to look after my poor babies . " Her head touched the sofa and she sat bolt upright . " I married a man with no seeds at all . " She fell asleep , her stomach gurgling . Levin went upstairs to the little girl 's room and turned on the light . She stopped crying and stared at him . Her bottle was in the crib so he fed her part of it . In the next room , through the open door he saw Erik sitting up in his bed . " Who 're you ? " " Mr. Levin  --  the funny man . " " I want a drink . " He went to the bathroom and got the water . Erik drank and lay back . As Levin was covering him the child raised his head and kissed him under the eye . Mary was asleep . Levin put off the light and listened to the children sleeping . The poor orphans . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure spring startled Levin at the end of January . He had been forewarned of this , but the long habit of Eastern winter kept him from believing the seasoncould go without once punishing by blizzard or lacerating freeze every dweller in its domain . He felt unsettled for it seemed to him the unused winter must return to extract a measure of revenge for dying so young , so little of it had there been : a few months of darkish rain , a week of soft wet snow ( crowning the mountains and drawing the hills closer ) , gone quickly to slush then gone forever ; the returned rain broken by nine days of sunlit cold  --  never below twenty degrees , afternoons warming  --  which exhilarated Levin although his students complained . Maybe a reluctant icicle had hung for a day or two from the roof of Mrs. Beaty 's porch . Having as a kid , nose and feet burning , waded many times through snowdrifts , and often worn an overcoat into mid-April , Levin felt now as though he had been reprieved by prestidigitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wild wind . If winter were already dead it left him with some guilt , as though he had helped murder it , or got something for nothing when they read the will , rare in his life . Yet the thought remained that to be alive was a short season . Pessimism was momentary . Better enjoy the changes that had taken place with or without his knowing . Primroses , Mrs. Beaty had showed him , were in flower , had been all winter . At Christmastime , as Levin lay gloomily in bed , daffodil shoots were a stiff two inches above the ground ; crocus under January snow . On New Year 's day naked jasmine in the backyard by the cherry tree touched the dark world with yellow light ; forsythia performed the same feat a few weeks later . Camelias were budding in January ; quince and heather in flower , petals touching the stillest air . After the snow Levin had come upon a cluster of violets behind the garage . Rain was lighter , moodier , giving way to broken sunlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-thirty . There was as yet little of spring to smell , either because early spring odors were still too subtle for his city-built nose , or the Northwest cool cheated scent , the throb of emotion in the wake of warm fragrance . If this was spring , Levin knew it because he eternally hunted for it , was always nosing out the new season , the new life , " a new birth in freedom . " On this reasonable facsimile of a late March day , a Thursday when Levin had no afternoon classes , although he had planned to return to the office after lunch and grind away at technicalp195reports , the weather tempted him to a country walk to see what nature across the bridge had been busy at without him ; and to feel the sun 's beneficent hand on his head . He got outofhis bureau drawer , where they had lain all winter , his binoculars and Western Birds , Trees and I ' lowers . Since he had read in last night 's paper it might rain , lie carried his trusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant wood rising to the hills . He went by a route he had not tried before , a country road lined with old pussy willow trees , their sticky budding branches massed against the sky . Although Levin rejoiced at the unexpected weather , his pleasure was tempered by a touch of habitual sadness at the relentless rhythm of nature ; change ordained by a force that produced , whether he wanted it or not , today 's spring , tomorrow 's frost , age , death , yet no man 's accomplishment ; change that was n't change , in cycles eternal sameness , a repetition he was part of , so how win freedom in and from self ? Was this why his life , despite his determined effort to break away from what he had already lived , remained so much the same ? And why , constitutedas he was and living the experience he engendered , he had not won anything more than short periods of contentment , not decently prolonged to where he could stop asking himself whether he had it or not ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How often have I told myself happinessis not something you flush out in a planned expedition , a hidden complicated grail all at once the beholder 's ; that it 's rather grace settled on the spirit in desire of life . We 're here for a short time , often under the worst circumstances  --  possible that man may someday be blown off the tips of Somebody 's Fingers ; the battle lost before we knew what we were about , yet how magnanimously beautiful even to have been is . I have many times in differing circumstances told myself this , so why ca n't I quit worrying if happiness comes and how long lasts , if it does either ? Discontent brings neither cold cash nor true love , therefore why not enjoy this tender marvelous day instead of greeting it with news of everything I have n't got ?  |p196He  was still a distance from the hills when he approached a large wood  --  call it a forest  --  that he had come upon before by other routes . On impulse Levin left the road , hopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the evergreens . Once in the wood he was not entirely at his ease because he was trespassing , and as he went quietly along he worried about possible bears or maybe a snarling cougar or two , though he had heard of none in the vicinity ; if there were any he had only an umbrella to defend himself with . Mostly his uneasiness arose from the thought that his life had been lived largely without experience of very many trees , and among them he felt a little unacquainted . Yet to be alone in the forest , this far in , was already a feat for a born city boy who had never been a Boy Scout . Levin took heart . He walked on soft ground among dark conifers , giants and dwarfs , and a large scattering of leafless other trees ; but now he recognized fir , cedars , in green skirts touching the ground , blue spruce , and even hemlock , the trees in profusion , their branches interlaced , the forest gloom broken by rays of sunlight dappling the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolness , suggestedendless distance and deepest depth . Levin began to be worried about getting lost if he wandered too far in , and to avoid circular confusion , considered marking his way with bits of torn paper . The mystery of the wood , the presence of unseenlife in natural time , and the feeling that few men had been where he presently was , ( Levin , woodsman , explorer ; he now understood the soul of Natty Bumppo , formerly paper ; " Here , D. Boone GILLED A. BAR " ) caused him to nudge aside anxiety and continue to venture among the trees in shade and sunlight . As he came out of the woods into a clearing , a yellow-green , rich grassy meadow sloping downward , a flock of robins  --  from Canada , he had been told , while the Cascadian species was vacationing in California ; you were dealing with strangers who looked like friends  --  scattered noisily over his head . From the wood across the field a bird hidden in a tree screeched atp197the world . Levin 's head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , a woody tattoo . After a short bafflement he located with his glasses a bird drilling away near the top of a dead fir . Hurriedly searching for his bird guide , he read with the greatest satisfaction that he had spotted a red-headed woodpecker , never before seen so clearly . The bird spied Levin and flew into the forest . A moment later he turned pages hastily to identify first a Seattle wren , then a very blue , graybellied blue jay , exciting color ; and a chickadee , the first he remembered looking at and naming ; also a yellow bird he could n't identify , whose flight above the treeline Levin followed with pleasure until it disappeared into light like a light gone out . Who sees this in Manhattan Isle ? None but the gifted . Here the common man rejoiced in what was naturally visible . But being where he was not supposed to be continued to trouble Levin ; he turned as if forewarned someone was in the wood behind him ; expecting , if not a boot in the pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the hell off private property . He would run like mad . Instead , he saw Pauline Gilley watching him from amid trees . She looked like someone he had never expected to see again , or was the thought a trick on himself to protect what was left of unused virginity ? Pauline approached as if unwilling , an expression he attributed to an embarrassment of remembrance ; then as though she had made peace with herself in mid-voyage , she looked up , smiling at his astonishment . Her raincoat unbuttoned , he took in blouse , gray skirt , long blue socks and walking shoes . He also quickly calculated what she had on underneath , an innovation in their relationship . Her hair shone in the sun . " I 'm sorry I startled you , Mr. Levin . I 'm just as surprised to see you . " Levin explained his umbrella ; the paper said rain . She smiled at his armload . " Let me help you . " " It 's nothing much . " Her presence in the wood aroused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late to the right place , familiar situation of his dreams.  | " The day turned out so springlike I left the children with a sitter so I could walk , " Pauline said . " You 've been here before  --  in this wood ? " " Yes , have n't you ? " " No . " " I did n't know you watched birds . " " If you can call it that . Most get away before I know what I 've seen . " " You were engrossed when I saw you . " " When I was a kid I used to look out of the window atsparrows on telegraph wires or hopping in the snow . " " I have n't seen you for weeks , Mr. Levin , " Pauline said . " About two , I 'd say . Time flies . " " I talked so much at the Bullocks . I do n't think I 've been that much affected by liquor in years . " " No need to worry , I 've forgotten what you said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other . When their eyes met , although he obsessively expected a veil , there was none , and Levin beheld an expression of such hungry tenderness he could hardly believe it was addressed to him . Enduring many complicated doubts , he dropped his things in the grass . They moved toward each other , their bodies hitting as they embraced . " Dear God , " Pauline murmured . Her kiss buckled his knees . He had not expected wanting so much in so much giving . Levin warned himself , Take off , kid , and in their deep kiss saw himself in flight , bearded bird , dream figure , but could n't move . They parted , breathing heavily , looked at each other as though seeing were drinking  --  he could have counted twenty  --  and after mutual hesitation to the point of pain , embraced . " My darling . " " Pauline . " He kept himself from crying love . Levin clutched at her chest , and seizing nothing , ran hisp199hand the other way . She gripped his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we go ? " " Anywhere . " She took his hand and they went into the woods , Levin glancing back to see where his things were . " Here , " she said in the green shade . The evergreens were thick , the ground damp but soft with fir needles and dead leaves . " Spread your coat . " She spread hers over his , then stepped out of her shoes . She removed a black undergarment , the mask unmasked . Lying on the coats , Pauline raised her hips and drew back her skirt , to Levin the most intimate and beautiful gesture ever made for him . He hung his trousers over the branch of a fir . When he knelt she received him with outstretched arms , gently smoothed his beard , then embraced him with passion as she fixed her rhythm to his . He was throughout conscious of the marvel of it  --  in the open forest , nothing less , what triumph ! As she was combing the needles out of her hair the woods turned dark and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an old lichenous elm . If he expected uneasinessafter the fact , he felt none . When he searched her eyes for guilt he was distracted by their light and warmth . He held the umbrella over their heads , his arm around her waist . They were resting against the tree trunk , her head on his shoulder . He felt , in gratitude , peace , and tried not to think of what he did n't have to , namely the future . When she spoke he wished she had n't . " Please do n't worry about anything . " " Worry ? " " I mean if you have any regrets you 're not bound to me . There are no obligations . You can leave this minute if you wish . "  |p200Levin  pictured himself leaving her under the tree in the rain . Later he returned to see if she were there . " Why speak of regrets ? I have none . " " Your eyes seem sad . " " The fix of habit . I 'm happy . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh you , your quality . I never had it this way before . " " You have n't had many women , have you ? " " Not many . " " I know you 've been in love . " " Often  --  with the wrong kind . One or two made hash of me . " " I 'm so sorry . " " My own fault , but that 's in the past . " " Poor boy , did you have to connive for sex ? " " Not connive but pleasure never came too easy . " She was silent a minute . " Did this ? " " This is good . " " You respect me ? " " Of course . " " Mrs. Gilley , mother of two ? " " I respect you , Pauline . " They kissed again . She rubbed her head against his . " I 'm hungry to know everything about you . " " I 've had my bad times . " " Tell me what happened . " Levin was reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wo n't ask again . " He said , thick-voiced , half his face crippled , " The emotion of my youth was humiliation . That was n't only because we were poor . My father was continuously a thief . Always thieving , always caught , he finally died in prison . My mother went crazy and killed herself . One night I came home and found her sitting on the kitchen floor looking at a bloody bread knife . " Pauline leaned her face against him . " I mourned them but it was a lie . I was in love with an unhappy , embittered woman who had just got rid of me . Ip201mourned the loss of her more than I did them . I was mourningmyself . I became a drunk , it was the only fate that satisfiedme . " She moaned ; Levin trembled . " I drank , I stank . I was filthy , skin on bone , maybe a hundredten pounds . My eyes looked as though they had been pissed on . I saw the world in yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For two years I lived in self-hatred , willing to part with life . I wo n't tell you what I had come to . But one morning in somebody 's filthy cellar , I awoke under burlap bags and saw my rotting shoes on a broken chair . They were lit in dim sunlight from a shaft or window . I stared at the chair , it looked like a painting , a thing with a value of its own . I squeezed what was left of my brain to understand why this should move me so deeply , why I was crying . Then I thought , Levin , if you were dead there would be no light on your shoes in this cellar . I came to believe what I had often wanted to , that life is holy . I then became a man of principle . " " Oh , Lev , " she said . " That was the end of my drinking though not of unhappiness . Just when I thought I had discovered what would save me  --  when I believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-redemption was n't possible because of what I was  --  my emptiness the sign of my worth . I denied the self for having denied life . I managed to get and hang onto a little job but as a person I was nothing . People speak of emptiness but it was a terrifying fullness , the soul has gas . It is n't exactly apathy , you have feeling but it 's buried six feet . I could n't respond to experience , the thought of love was unbearable . It was my largest and most hopeless loss of self before death . " Her eyes were shut . " I felt I had come to something worse than drunkenness . This went on for how long I ca n't say . I lived in stone . My only occasional relief was in reading . I had a small dark room in a rooming house overrun by roaches and bugs . Oncep202a week I burned the bedbugs with a candle through the bedsprings ; they popped as they died . One Sunday night after a not otherwise memorable day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling I was about to remember everything I had read in my life . The book felt like a slab of marble in my hands . I strained to see if it could possibly be a compendium of every book ever written , describing all experience . I felt I had somewhere read something I must remember . Sensing an affirmation , I jumped up . That I was a free man lit in my mind even as I denied it . I suddenly knew , as though I were discovering it for the first time , that the source of freedom is the human spirit . This had been passed down to me but I had somehow forgotten . More than forgetting  --  I had lived away from it , had let it drift out of my consciousness . I thought I must get back what belongs to me ; then I thought , This is how we invent it when it 's gone . ' Afterwards I experienced an emotionof well being so intense that I 've lived on it ever since . " IIe said no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sensed it . I knew who you were . " " I felt a new identity . " " You became Levin with a beard . " " What was new were my plans for myself . " " I wo n't interfere with them , " she said fervently . " We sha n't meet again . " Pauline smoked as they watched the rain let up . " I 'd better be getting back . " Levin , gathering up his things , tucked the umbrella under his arm , and they went through the wet woods . He called it a miraculous forest but she laughed and said it was the property of Cascadia College , where they trained foresters . " Then it 's no miracle you came here today ? " " I 've often been , on picnics with forestry friends , and sometimes I come alone to walk in the woods . " It worried him they might have been seen , but she seemedp203unconcerned so he was content . Whosever forest it was , he had gone into it , met her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel enough for Levin . On the road to town , although the sun shone brightly through broken clouds , he opened the umbrella over their heads.  |p204In  his room Levin laughed one minute and groaned the next . Breathing heavily , he paced back and forth for hours . Or he stared out of an open window , lost in profuse memory . Sometimeshe silently celebrated his performance in the open  --  his first married woman , sex uncomplicated in a bed of leaves , short hours , good pay . He was invigorated by the experience , one he would not have predicted for himself . A few minutes later he was soberly conscious of this figure within  --  an old friend with a broken nose warning him against risking his new identity . The new life was very new . Yet he wondered what he could be with her . Could he , with Pauline , be more than he was ? Levin thought in terms of experience with her , not necessarily commitment . Had n't she herself denied he was obligated to her ? This could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he was glad he had told her about the past ; it was a relief to share that with someone.  |p205By  night the forest had taken on a dreamlike quality . Was there such a forest ? Were the trees still standing ? Were they real ? Was it Pauline he had met there ? He asked himself , Who is she ? Extraordinary thing to have been in a woman and not know her . Could he trust her ? What did she want from him ; why , for instance , Levin ? Because her saintly papa had worn whiskers  --  beard as totem ? Was there perhaps some design in her choice of him ( Had she purposely followed him into the woods ? Impossible ! ) or was their lovemaking the more or less accidental end of a discontented woman 's desire ? If not , if she had in one way or another sought him out , what could he offer her , a man at thirty still running after last year 's train , far behind in the world ? Nothing . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose behavior he had no way of predicting was no joke . Who could guess what grade she would want changed ; or what she might whisper to her lawfully-wedded spouse in a moment of tenderness , or hurl at him in hatred . If she threw Levin up to Gilley , farewell Levin . He feared his fate in her hand . Yet if she were concealmentitself he knew his relationship to Gilley was changed for all time . This bothered him . Since he disliked him he wanted it to be for a just cause , to wit , Gilley , not because Levin had stolen from him  --  the primal cheating , result , oppressorhating oppressed . The thought that haunted him most was that the slightest revelation of the act under the tree would mean the worst disaster he could think of : end of future . During the week , though she was often in his mind , Levin felt he did n't miss her , and probably vice versa . She could never be interested in a man with his kind of past . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right  --  she had seemed more than sympathetic to him , had practically wept . Probably it was closer to truth to think she had wanted the distraction of an affair , had had it , and quits . Or maybe she 's now ashamed of it . She 's the one with a husband ; thank God I have no wife . So fare thee well . Yet too bad , for what 's good deserves repeating . He had been thinking it was impossible to live onp206memory of sexual pleasure , no matter how satisfying . The better the pleasure the more useless the memory . This was his mood one rainy night , the week after the forest , as he sat in his room . The fire of unseasoned applewood had sizzled out after nine , and Levin , tired of reading , had rebuilt it . He went back to his book but found it hard to concentrate ; had to nail down each sentence before he could move to the next . The alternative was to shut the book and think of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I have her again I must keep romance apart from convenience . Love goes with freedom in my book . He had less than a minute to test his reflection , for there was a sound on the back stairs , and through the blurred glass he saw Pauline about to tap with a key . He rose hastily , his impression that she had been observing him , questioning what  --  his existence ? worth ? good sense ? Levin momentarily thought of disappearing , but went instead to open the door where she stood . Could a man do less on a rainy night ? Pauline entered quickly . " Did you want me to come ? " Her eyes hid from his. 1f he said no it was n't yes , but Levin said yes . Still , it was yes without pain , unless pain could be present without one 's knowing , an unlikely procedure . They kissed and at once parted as if there was much to say , or at least get straight , before they could kiss again . Her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Levin hung up her wet raincoat . Pauline stood before the fire in the green dress he remembered from the night he had banged his head . She wore pendant earrings . " Just let me get my breath back . " But breath she had . What was missing he was n't sure . She seemed troubled , said little . Levin guessed what it probably was  --  the difference between last time and this . Their meeting in the woods was accidental . Tonight she must have lied to Gilley when she left the house . There was , in any case , that house to leave and this to come to.  |p207For  a half hour they watched the fire . She offered no explanation for her mood and he made it a point not to ask . He had disappointing visions of a short sexless evening . At length Pauline sighed and gave him her hand . She looked around . " Is there anyone else on this floor ? " " Nobody . Mrs. Beaty sleeps downstairs . " Pauline plucked off her earrings and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and began to undress . He did the same though nobody had asked him . The contract was in the prior act , there in the forest . In her lace-bosomed slip reflecting the fire she looked at him with a half-sad smile . " Do you like me in this ? " " It 's a poetic garment . " " You 've never seen me naked . " The fact surprised him . She drew the slip over her head and was naked . Her hips were slim . She was long waisted , the legs and trunk gracefully proportioned , her arms and shoulders lovely . Naked , she looked unmarried . But her chest was barren , the flowerlike nipples only slightly fleshy . He had almost looked away . " Shall I keep my slip on ? Would you like that better ? " " No . " He had to watch himself with her . She pressed down the mattress to see if the bed creaked . " Are you afraid ? " he asked her . " Dreadfully . I 'd die if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . " Do n't be afraid . The landlady 's deaf when she 's asleep . She 's asleep now . " She was suddenly passionate , bit his lip . In bed she met him with open mouth . He thought what he must do for her but there was hardly time . " Take me . " She came quickly , at the end half singing out as she had in the woods , a sound that sang in him . At its onset he had taken it for sobbing  --  regret for what she was doing  --  but it was a halting cry ofp208pleasure . She took him with her before he thought it time to go . He laughed at the ease of it . Afterwards she asked , her face lit in the glow of a cigarette , " Does My young love 's rip'ning breasts ' mean so much ? Does my flat bosom bother you ? " " If it did it does n't . " " At least I have symmetry , " she said . " My roommate in college had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for symmetry . " And I 've never worn falsies , would you want me to ? " " You 're not the type . " " What type am I ? " " The type that does n't wear them . " " Please always be honest with me , " Pauline said . He said he had to or got mangled . She asked if he always taught himself lessons from experience . " Almost always . " " My poor Levin . " " I do n't like to make the mistakes I 've made . " She said , after putting out her cigarette , " What will you teach yourself from us ? " " Something good , I think . " " Something lovely , perhaps enduring ? " He said he thought so . " Do you think you could fall in love with a woman without breasts ? " " I 've never tried . " She said , suddenly , " I should n't really be here . " Pauline was at once out of bed . " Gerald 's in Marathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a sitter . I feel like a heel . " But she swept off the bedsheet and tightened it under him . Emptying the ashtray into the fireplace , Pauline aired the room , dressed , and left . Levin was at once asleep.  |p209She  visited him not often but often enough . One of her " meetings " was a good enough excuse for a night out . And Gilley assisted by teaching a winter-term weekly extension course for teachers , in Marathon . Usually Pauline walked the dozen blocks to Levin 's . When she had the car she parked it about two blocks from the house . Gilley was home from Marathonby eleven . She had left Levin 's room at ten-thirty , short but sweet . He could read afterwards without a stray thought , a great convenience . He envisioned a new Utopia , everyone over eighteen sexually satisfied , aggression reduced , peace in the world . Once she came for an hour after Gilley had fallen asleep , worrying Levin . She was no longer dreadfully afraid ; the change in her had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch in Erik 's room and Gilley was a heavy sleeper . In the unlikely event he awoke he would not miss her . But Levin asked her not to take chances . She promised , then went frankly on record in extenuation of the chances she took . " Gerald can sometimes be indifferent to me for weeks . He began to be after we found out the true reason why we could n't have children , although I will admit there are times when it 's my fault , when I just do n't have the energy . " What a waste , he thought . The next time they were in bed , after Levin had dozed and waked , she brought up Gerald . " Why do n't you like him ? " " I never said I did n't . " " Tell me what happened in the department . " " I told you we did n't agree about some things . " " Be patient with him , " she said . " He has good will towards you . " Let 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really been very sweet to me . Sometimes I 'm a moody bitch , but he 's usually patient and I 'd like to be grateful . " He said nothing . " We were n't doing so badly at first , " Pauline said , " then we began to have some nasty spells . He disappointed me in certain ways , some not his fault . I know I disappointed him . We hadp210a very bad time just before we got Erik but it 's really been better since the kids came . They 've made me as nearly happy as I 've been in recent years . Gerald does a lot for us . Lately I 've been thinking I 'd like to be in love with him again . It was very nice when we first were . Do you think anybody can bring past love alive or is it gone forever once it goes ? " " I do n't know . " " Sometimes I 've thought that if I were having an affair he might sense I 'm being attractive to someone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If that happened maybe I would respond . Do you think that could happen ? " " I doubt it , " he said . " So do I , " said Pauline . He interpreted this to mean she wanted pleasure , solace , a momentary change , but no serious involvement with him . Her marriage , deficient as it seemed to him , apparently meant something to her . The situation suited him . If it made their relationship seem less consequential than it might be , on reflectionso much the better . If his affair with Pauline inspired Gilley to respond to her , and she to love him for responding , so much the freer Levin 's conscience . It was n't easy to be helpful while enjoying the fruits of another man 's wife . He anticipated her visits , the tap of her key on the glass . They embraced ardently , her hand going for his fly . Levin guessed this was new for her , probably a new way she saw herself . It was new for him . Off came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breasts or none , her woman 's wealth satisfied him . When he touched her nipples the effect was electric . She could be a little wild in bed . " Your fingers are fires . " He enjoyed her long body , the cool flesh , sex smell , fragrant hair . He enjoyed the possession and adventure , her intensity with detachment . In bed he rarely thought of her as Gilley 's wife . If he did he countered conscience with the thought he could break it off by spending the summer in San Francisco . In the fall he could find some excuse not top211see her . He could say he had fallen in love and was thinking of getting married . The forest had shrunk to a double bed . In bed they lived , in bed explored their bodies and history . She often asked him about his life , what he was like at ten , seventeen , twenty . " A romantic , " Levin said . " That 's still in you . " He shrugged . " Almost gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lived too much on air . " " " I like that in you . " Then she said , " Is love air ? " " Too often it was . " When he asked about her she asked : Did he find her attractive ? Did he like her hair long ? Did he like her legs ? " I have such big feet . " " I 'm not pretty , am I ? " She said once she did n't think she was interesting . " I 've had so few experiences . My life was so prosaically different from yours . It 's almost as though I would n't go the extra step to make somethinghappen , and not much did . " " You are an interesting woman , " Levin said . " Do you mean as a person or sexually ? " " As a person with sex . " " Is that part of me strong , the sex ? " " Yes . " " I wish I had been more that way when I was young . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover or two . " " Did n't you ? " " I was a virgin when I was married . " " After that ? " " I was interested in men but I 've never had the sort of relationship we 're having . " A minute later she asked , " Tell me what you hear about me ? " " In what way ? " " Any way . "  | " Jeannette says you 're a very fine person . " " She 's a very fine person . What does George say ? " " Nothing I remember . " " Avis ? " " She thinks you could do more to help your husband . " " She 's right , " said Pauline . " Is that all she said ? " " Yes . " " She 's had a crush on Gerald for years . " Levin said he had thought so . He fell asleep . She woke him . " A woman my age is too old for a man yours . Would n't you really be better off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts were scattered and he answered nothing . She said wearily , " I 'd be afraid of intense love now . " She dressed and went down the back stairs . He expected her nightly all the next week but she didn'tcome . One day they met by chance on a downtown street . " Did I say something wrong last time ? " Levin asked . " No , I have n't been myself . " " Not my fault ? " " I 've been nervous , nothing new , an effect of periodicity . " " When can you come again ? " After a while she said she would soon . Pauline reappeared the next night . Usually she was at once affectionate but tonight she sat at the fire , chain smoking . They talked but not about themselves . When he looked directly at her she seemed to look away . Levin assumed she felt guilty and foresaw the end of their affair . " Suppose we were to break up ? " she said . " It would depend on you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coat . She looked lonely . Levin , exploring an insight , lifted her and carried her to the bed . She stiff armed him . " You do n't dare . " He pushed her down . Afterwards she grabbed his frontispiece . " I 'll never let you go , Mr. Micawber. "  |p213The  next time after making love , Levin experienced a fiery pain in the butt . He broke into a cold sweat and lay apart from her , his body stiff , pretending to be asleep . He shoved his face into the pillow to keep from crying out . For ten brutal minutes he was in torment , then the pain gradually eased . He felt sickly limp but relieved , thankful for his good health . Less than a week later he felt the same agonizing , flaming pain . Though tensed to misery Levin managed to hide it from her although the torture was worse than any he remembered . It moved up the side , then to the scrotum , then back to the butt , a harrowing embarrassment after sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spasm he began to dread going to bed with her . At the same time he was disgusted with himself -- pure Levin reaction , for every pleasure , pain . He thought of telling Pauline what the trouble was , but for a lover it was a too vital weakness to confess , one which might , if it continued , waken contempt . When she appeared the next time he suggestedgoing for a drive or maybe to a movie in another town . Pauline seemed touched by the suggestion , sweetly agreed , but in one womanly way and another  --  although he sensed her puzzlement  --  enticed him into a performance . Levin paid the price of emission , a fiery pain in the ass . " Are n't you well ? " she asked after minutes of silence . He said he was . " I feel you have n't been enjoying yourself lately , I ca n't quite describe it . Has my breath been bad ? " " No . " " Would you like me to come less often , or not at all ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps afraid to ask more , obviously worried . When the pain was gone , although they talked affectionately , he saw her watching him . Before she left she clung to him.  |p214On  the night of Gilley 's next class in Marathon , Levin tried hiding from her . After supper he went to a movie and later drank beer until midnight . She had left a note : " Sorry I missed you . " He slept badly , dreamed his whiskers were on fire . It seemed to him he had just fallen asleep when he was awakened by footsteps coming stealthily up the back stairs . These were n't her steps . Levin listened , nailed to the bed , his heart thundering . The steps stopped . He jumped up in wet sweat , fumbled for the light , fell over his shoes , sprang up and flung open the door . Nothing . Rain in swirling light . Someone wandered up the inside stairs . Levin hastily got into a robe before Mrs. Beaty knocked . She stood at the door in her flannel robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . He said he had had a nightmare and fallen out of bed . She said to be careful , she knew a man who had broken his back that way . Fearing something serious  --  kidney , bladder , rectal  --  possibly cancer  --  and because he was making Pauline so jumpy she went two moody visits without looking at the bed , Levin decided to see a doctor . He had hoped the pain would go without treatment but it was as bad as ever when they went to bed again . One afternoon he drove to Marathon to someone recommended by Joe Bucket ; he did n't want anyone in Easchester to know his business . The doctor , an old man , examined him elaborately with every instrument he could think of except forceps . He made various tests , then pronounced his judgment . " Tinsion is all I can find . " " My God , what 's that ? " " Some sort of tinsion is causing rectal and other spasms , though possibly it 's the prostate , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet when you have the pain ? " " I 've gone . " " Does it help ? " " No . " " No relief or relaxation ? "  | " Is n't sex supposed to relax you ? " " It is and it is n't . It does and it does n't . " The doctor scratched behind his ear . " Is the lady your wife ? " " Yes , " he lied . " Are conditions favorable for intercourse ? " " Yes . " " You are n't worried about your business or any such wor-ries ? " " No . " " Beats me , I 'm afraid , " said the doctor , " unless you do n't like your wife . " Everyman 's Freud , thought Levin . " You might rest up a week . " " I 've rested , it comes back . " The doctor wrote out a prescription . " Take one of the little green pills before intercourse . If that does n't work , take the white pill afterward . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anti-spasmodic . The other is a pain killer . If neither of them work come back and I 'll give you an antibiotic . " In the street Levin tore up the prescription and scattered the pieces . Levin afflicted by mystery : What was the painful egg the rooster was trying to lay ? In the middle of driving home a thought he had had but never particularly valued , stalled the car . He was asking himself what he was hiding from : That he too clearly saw her shortcomings and other disadvantages , and was urgently urging himself to drop her before it was too late ? That he was tired of the uneasy life , fed up with assignations with the boss 's wife , sick up to here with awareness of danger and fear of consequences ? Here was truth yet not enough truth . After mulling these and related thoughts , Levin tracking an idea concerning Pauline , fell over one regardinghimself : the dissatisfaction he had lately been hiding from , or feeling for an inadmissibly long time , was with him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . Love ungiven had caused Levin 's pain . To be unpained hep216must give what he unwillingly withheld . It was then he jumped up , stalling the car . Once home , he did n't know what to do with himself . Run twice around the block . Stand on his ear ? Dig hard head into concrete sidewalk ? Kiss the mirror or hit it with a hammer for imaging the dark-bearded one who ever complicated the infernally complicated ? And Einstein , it said in the papers , used the same cake of soap to shave and bathe . Levin sat in his chair , momentarily slept , started while dreaming , bounded up to spend hours staring out of the open window at nothing he particularly saw . He lay on the bed , then rose up as if the sheets were on fire . He left his room to hurry somewhereanywhere  --  andawoke to find himself standing on the back stairs . Above the tops of budding trees he watched the flaring , setting sun , wanting to abolish thought , afraid to probe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a fact that would alter his existence . But nature  --  was it ?  --  a bull aimingat a red flag ( Levin 's vulnerability , the old self 's hunger ) charged from behind and the Manhattan matador , rarely in control of any contest , felt himself lifted high and plummeted over violet hills toward an unmapped abyss . Through fields of stars he fell in love . ... Love ? Levin eventually sighed . Is it love or insufficient exercise ? Escape , perhaps , or excitement born from the tension of secrecy , wrongdoing ? Love ? How at all possible if the proposedlover had such profound reservations concerning the game , rules , even players ? Consider once more , for instance , her lank frame , comic big tootsies , nose flying , chest bereft of female flowers . He mourned that motherless breast , the lost softness over the heart to pillow a man 's head . He had once in frustration nipped at her nipple ; she had socked his head with both fists . Levin had never imagined such as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of her ambient : prior claimant , husband-in-law ; the paraphernalia of her married life  --  love her , love her past . With her possibly take kids and their toys . Not for me , he told himself . He wantedp217no tying down with ropes , long or short , seen or invisible  --  had to have room to move so he could fruitfully use freedom . If , ecstasied out of his senses he let down his guard  --  was leapt on by fate  --  Lord help Levin ! But if he loved her why loved he her ? You are comely , my love . Your self is loveliness . You make me rich in feeling . You have grace , character . I trust you . He loved because she had one unforgettable day given herself to a city boy in a forest . And for the continuance of her generosity in bed ( was he less generous ? ) abating desire as she made it grow , taking serious chances ( did he not chance as much ? ) . Or was he moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , to drag truth closer , because he was compelled by his being to be in love with her open , honest , intelligent , clearly not very happy self ? ( Why do I feel I have chosen her because I am her choice ? ) The catechism made little difference , for he knew fait accompli when accomplished . Who was he kidding , or what pretending to delay or dress in camouflage ? " The truth is I love Pauline Gilley . " His confession deeply moved him . What an extraordinary only human thing to be in love . What human-woven mystery . As Levin walked the streets under a pale moon he felt he had recovered everything he had ever lost . If life is not so , at least he feels it is . The world changed as he looked . He thought of his unhappy years as though they had endured only minutes , black birds long ago dissolved in night . Gone for all time . He had made too much of past experience , not enough of possibility 's new forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . ... But Levin had long ago warned himself when he arrived at this intensity of feeling  --  better stop , whoa . Beware the forms of fantasy . He had been , as a youth , a luftmensch , sop of feeling , too easy to hurt because after treading on air he hit the pavement head first . Afterwards , pain-blinded , he groped for pieces of reality . " I 've got to keep control of myself . I must always know where I am . " He had times without numberp218warned himself , to harden , toughen , put on armor against love . It snowed heavily . The snow fell in buffeted veils . It bent shrubs and small evergreens and broke branches everywhere . There had n't been such a snowfall in years , Mrs. Beaty said . Gilley 's Marathon night passed and Pauline did not visit Levin . He accused himself , then blamed the snow , until after three warm days it vanished and she still had not appeared . Had his antics , while avoiding the bed , scared her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she had once asked him not to . Another Marathon night went by and Levin 's desperation grew . He felt he had lost her . When Pauline appeared in his room ten days after he had discovered he loved her , Levin was moved by the glow of her , the lovely form she achieved in being . How love perfects each imperfect thing . What she was was beauty . With breasts she could n't possibly be the one he loved . I must n't forget this , he thought , it 's worth remembering . Yet as she entered the room he knew at once  --  it smote him  --  that her detachment , almost unconcern  --  was something more than of the moment ; and if desire , no more than that , the little she wanted from him , for which he castigated himself . She scanned his face and finding him fit plucked off her earrings . Hearing no objections to the contrary , she undressed for bed . When he embraced her she stiffened momentarily in his arms . When he spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking of forever . He felt he had loved her from the time he had laid eyes on her at the railroad station last summer  --  years ago . They had looked guardedly at one another . Had she guessed he would love her and turned away as though the thought was burdensome ? Could she ever know that before meeting her he had loved the idea of Pauline Gilley ? Did n't that make him worthy of her love ? But what had tilted Levin into love had not tipped her . In bed she dispatched the act with an easy cry . He loved her ,  |p219wanting  as he loved . She fell asleep as he lay awake thinking of the unyielding irony of his life . Afterward she said , " You 've been so strange . " He apologized . " I had some trouble but it 's gone now . " " Is that the truth ? " " Pauline , the truth is I love you . " " She said after silence , " How like a woman to want to love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She held her hands to her ears . He shut his mouth , eyes , his life . She dressed and quickly left . He was n't looking . Each day passed excruciatingly , he tried not to count . He fought thinking of her , a mockery  --  she was in every thought . He beat his brains to destroy her place in his mind without maiming himself . How to be , please God , not Levin ? How to live loveless or not live ? Once more he paid for who he was , a dirty deal . Late one night she tapped on his window and nervously entered . Levin , putting down a book he could n't read , faced her with what dignity he could muster , concealing love in his own defense , and the pain her presence invoked . " I saw your light , " she said . He answered nothing . " I tried not to come , " Pauline said . " It is n't fair to you . " Fair or foul , he would settle for sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 've been through  --  I have no right to love you or expect your love , my poor darling . " He rose with an aching heart . " I love you , " she was saying , " although I try not to . I tried to be fair to you , to Gerald , and my children . " They embraced . She dug her nails into his back . He beat her with his heart . " I love you , Lev . That 's my name for you . Sy is too muchp220like sigh , Lev is closer to love . I love you , I 'm sorry , you deservebetter . " " I deserve you . " " I should never have let you that day in the woods . But I love the kind of man you are , the kind I have to love . " " I love you willingly , with all my heart . " " Oh , my darling , we must do something with our lives . " My God , thought Levin , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilley whether on campus or some downtownstreet . From afar his red head flared ; Levin spun around and walked another way . In Humanities Hall he cut out tea to stay out of the coffee room . He could not avoid him at department meetings but did n't go near his office  --  had n't since Albert Birdless . If it were possible to escape the sight of him , Levin escaped . Yet when they met at somebody 's house , since Pauline was there he felt less self-conscious with Gerald than he thought he would be , guilt diminished because divided . ( She glanced at him ; he looked at her ; she looked away . ) Gilley and he sometimes talked shop , or the sportsman described how to wallop a little white ball across the grass or pull a half-dead fish out of water . He teaches me , thought Levin , and felt , in spite of all , a mild affection for the man , a sort of third cousin by marriage . But when he was alone ,  |p222Levin  worried . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his apple , spitting on his manhood , betraying him in a way the betrayer would have died to be betrayed . Levin had only casually tied morality to sex , the act , that is . Sex was where it grew , where with luck he found it , manna when least expected . What was for free was for free so long as nobody got hurt . If the lady was willing nature approved . But the matter became moral when , in getting at sex , a man interfered with another 's " rights . " Though he loved Pauline he had no right to her at present . Gilley had staked his claim and she had agreed , the marriage contract . Destroy the value of that and every personal right lost value . And pretense to Gerald , at the moment he was sleeping with his wife , that their relationship  --  such as it was  --  continued to be what had it had been , ladled hypocrisy on deceit . He was also ashamed of old-fashioned disloyalty to someone who had favored him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( bearded witch riding Gilley 's corpse ) repaid him with kicks where it hurt most , once , God forbid , he knew he had been kicked . Yet he tried to convince himself not to let his conscience weigh too heavily . Gilley was , after all , not guiltless ; he erred too . Indifferent to his wife in vital ways , did he deserve her fidelity ? His " rights " were formal , less than right because he had n't used them very well , at the very least to keep her from sexual hunger ; and rely on more than two adopted kids to hold the marriage together . He had flubbed his best chances . As to what Levin could do for her , what his chance amounted to ( beyond love itself ) he did not know for sure . Since she was not free it was a matter for the future ; they would have to wait for the right time . Pauline , after confessing her love , had thus far said nothing that reached past present , suggested no startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had , was still bound by the plans he had come with . If they were to live together some day , it would have to be arranged with the greatest care ; neither of them could afford to make the wrong compromises . He thought good must even/tually come from their love , willy nilly Gilley ; and when it came , . would the ex-husband profit less from more in the world ? ' Although such reflections induced no great peace , at least Levin knew where he stood , and was n't knowledge a blessing , even when it weighed on the head like lead ? So he continued to avoid Gilley wherever possible , a bit of a feat because they used the same classroom three mornings a week at contiguous hours . When the bell rang the instructor bolted but had twice managed to run into arms that had held Pauline . One day , shortly after lunch , Gilley knocked on Levin 's office door , the instructor fabricating a cracked smile as the condemnedman entered . Levin felt an odd abashed gratitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear friend ( apart from the fact they shared a wife ) who by his appearance in his office guaranteed his once and future innocence . By definition : a friend was not an enemy . Or as though the husband , present without a club to bash his brains in , was proof of innocence or , at the very least , of gentle pardon . The instructor , flipping open a folded handkerchief , hastily blew his nose , for he felt a tense discomfort until Gilley , visibly on edge , on noticing Levin 's collection of sample textbooks in the bookcase , suggestedit might be a good idea to call a meeting of the textbook committee sometime soon . Levin then felt a little relieved . " We 'll still be using The Elements in comp next fall , " Gerald said with that innocence that made him seem so simple in a complex world , " but you could be thinking ahead about a new freshman reader since we do change that every few years or so . " Levin agreed to call the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasy conscience plastered peril everywhere . Gerald , red behind both ears and back of his neck , lingered a minute over the view through the cracked window before turning again to Levin , who could not help sighing . " Have n't seen much of you lately , Sy . Do n't you drink tea any more ? "  | " Once in a while , " said Levin . " You are n't sore about anything in particular ? " " Not me . " " About the Birdless boy ? " " Not any more . " " Good . I did n't think you 'd carry a grudge . " " Ca n't stand them . " " I 'll try to remember to get that window fixed , " Gilley said absently . " No hurry . " " " But that 's not what I came to say . " Levin , as though in a sudden blizzard , feared the worst until Gerald explained he had been upset by something that had happened in Professor Fairchild 's office that morning . " I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone so I thought I 'd tell you . " Sunshine devoured blizzard ; Levin cautiously relaxed . " It was embarrassing , Sy , though I came in at the tail end , after Orville , who had borne the brunt of it , sent Milly to get me . What happened was this . The father of one of Dr. Kuck 's girl students  --  he 's a millhand in town  --  was waiting in Orville 's office when he returned from his cup of coffee . The man was about fit to be tied . Ile shouted he would n't have his daughter reading dirty stuff even if this is a college . He was objecting to a Hemingway short story Leopold had assigned in his survey of literature class . Orville tried to talk sensibly to the man but did n't get very far . He pounded with his fist on Orville 's desk and broke the plate glass cover . He also brought on one of Orville 's high blood pressure headaches . Finally Orville promised to look into the anthology we 've been using in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to him . Then he left for home , looking like something the cat had mauled . " " What story was he objecting to ? " Levin said , fiddling with his whiskers . " Ten Indians : Do you know it ? " " I do n't remember anything wrong with it . "  | " They object  --  the girl and her father  --  to the sex parts . " Levin rubbed his nose . " I do n't remember anything  --  **25;3302;TOOLONG . " " It has a raw touch of subject matter . The boy in the story has been having intercourse with this Indian girl . The girl 's father  --  the one in Leopold 's class  --  her father  --  said his daughtercame to him so embarrassed she could n't look him in the eye when she asked his opinion of the story . After reading it he forbade her to open the book again . Ile told Orville if he did n't get rid of that book he 'd go to President Lahhart , and if he did n't give him any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believe he would . That was when Orville called me in and it was all I could ( 10 to calm the man down . I read the story at lunch time and , frankly , I think we ought to drop the anthology . " Levin , suppressing excitement , hesitantly rose . " You ca n't do that . Did n't you tell the man what literature is , why we study it ? " " There was no telling him a thing . He was absolutely enraged . I thought he was going to sock Orville , he was that sore . " " Maybe you should have asked him to leave ? " Gilley made a face . " The townspeople are just as good as we are , Sy . " " I would n't doubt it , " said Levin , " but are ideas equal ? " " My policy with complaints is to hear them out , not antagonizeanybody further . " " Fine  --  but  --  er  --  censorship is dangerous business . " " I 'm not sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough spot in his voice . " Whatever you call it , that 's what it is . " " I 'd like to ask you what kind of budget you think this college would rate if this man 's complaint reached the legislature ? It 's more than likely they 'd see it pretty much as he does , We have to watch our step nowadays , or the next thing youp226know they 'd be accusing us of something a lot worse than teaching sexy stories . " " A college is no place to show contempt for art or intellect . If you drop the book , you 'll be making cowards of us all . " Gilley frowned . " Are n't those pretty strong words , Sy ? " Conscious of nervous knees , Levin sat down . Gerald spoke mildly . " You sound as though I were out to hurt the institution , although what I was thinking of first and foremost was our welfare . Let me tell you what happened in one of our colleges of education last year . This art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model to pose in his painting class , which nobody knew anything of till he exhibited the pictures they had painted of her . Well , the exhibition lasted about an hour , but that was long enough to raise a fuss and smell that the newspapers carried all over the state . The next thing everybody knew , it was reported in Time . Only last month one of my former students , who is now in oil in Venezuela , sent me a clipping of it in Spanish . But the worst of it was this . Although the art instructor was canned , in traveling around the state I still hear occasional smutty talk about what the students are learning in the Northern Cascadia College of Education . It would n't at all surprise me if their graduates are having trouble finding teaching jobs in the state , and maybe out . Now we ca n't afford to have that sort of thing happening here . The reputation of an institution of higher learning is sacred . That 's why I did everything I could to pacify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , the girl was just nineteen , and you know how sensitive they are at that age . " " Maybe she does n't belong in college , " Levin said . " Any Cascadia high school graduate is by law eligible to enter Cascadia College . " " If the course is too much for her she ought to drop it . " " That 's not the point . All she does is object to a story I ca n't legitimately defend . " " If you 'll pardon my saying so , I think you 're wrong . "  | " Have you read it recently ? " " No , but I 've never heard any criticism of it as an improper story . " " Leopold had gone through the anthology before he recommendedit to Orville , who at that time was too busy to read it , but he admits he might have slipped up on that particular story . For one thing , the boy 's father seems to have approved the son 's illicit relationship with the Indian girl , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the father  --  had witnessed the girl having intercourse with somebody else in the woods . Now would you defend that as a story for classroom discus-sion ? " Though Levin felt hot under his beard and was contemplating a sarcastic remark , he had quick second thoughts . In the woods ? For a wild minute he was convinced Gilley had followedPauline into the forest that day and was leading up to a devastating accusation . The instructor felt tense and sweaty , but as he guardedly studied Gerald 's face he knew his annoyancewas for something less than a mortal wound . Again he felt secret relief . " What would you have done if you were in my shoes ? " Gilley asked . Levin , limp , said he was n't sure . " I 'll bet you 'd have done pretty much what I had to . I 've read Aereopagitica , too , Sy , but we have to be practical as well as idealistic . Suppose we kept on teaching the story and one of our Indian students , or somebody with Indian blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians ? They 're pictured as drunks , even if there was a Fourth of July celebrationin the story . It would n't be long , I bet , before we 'd have the Un-American Committee here investigating us and making all sorts of nasty charges . Then where would we be ? " Staring out of the window , Levin noticed that the cracked glass resembled forked lightning . He drew a wavering breath but said nothing.  | " It 's a question , " Gilley was saying , " of our bread and butter . " " Not of our immortal souls ? " Levin laughed unwillingly . Responsive to smiles and laughter , Gilley beamed . " I knew you 'd see it my way . We may disagree here and there , Sy , but I think we value the same things . " In shame , Levin looked away . After rereading Hemingway 's innocent little story he felt faint , disgusted with himself for the ineffectuality of his protest . Standing at the lone urinal in the second floor lavatory he tried to think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of Dr. CD Fabrikant penetrated the thin wall from his classroom , and Levin , as though staring the man in his hypnotic big eye , listened . He had on this spot previously heard portions of lectures on " The Noble Savage in James Fenimore Cooper , " " Nightmare in Edgar Allan Poe , " " Huck Finn 's River Journey , " " The American Past , " and parts of other discourses . One heard in Fabrikant 's dehydrated rumble a breath of excitement in the expression of ideas , perhaps his only emotion after too many dry years ; still , he was able to communicate that ideas can excite , and Levin considered him a good teacher . He was at the moment lecturing on Emerson , and the instructor after a while listened with half an ear , still thinking of his upsetting talk with Gerald . Particularly since the Birdless hassle , Levin had thought he would like to suggest an improvement or two in department principles and methodology , subtly or otherwise , if not to Gilley perhaps to Fairchild through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since overcoming his drunkenness , perhaps as interest received on what he had accomplished , or what learned from what he had been through , he had from time to time felt the return of the courage of his convictions . As of old , Levin felt the human lot could be infinitely improved , but what was he doing about it ? The true liberal , in his moral fervor , kept alive the visionary ideal , in the long run perhaps thep229decisive thing , and fought at every opportunity to translate it into a better life for people ; but not Levin . The ideal got no farther than the inside of his head . Although thoughts of " making things better " continued to arrive by inspiration , at Cascadia College he restrained them . He did nothing to resist the status quo . He was , after all , a newcomer here ; of the same race as the Cascadians , true , but a distant relative . And if not abysmally timid , not terribly courageous . Too often , in the midst of discussions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though his nervous system voted conservative  --  brokeinto hot sweat and his knees softened ; lockjaw set in . He blamed this unwilled reaction partly on his personal history , partly it was the effect of the times . He had dragged through the past a weight of shame and sense of exclusion from normal life , engineered by his father , Harry the goniff , misfit turned thief  --  he stole from everyone and his own left hand  --  whose fantastic thieving was the talk of every neighborhood they had to move out of . Levin had his whole life felt imperiled . In recent years he had come to pity his father but was still influenced by his distortions . Add to a backlog of personal insecurity his portion of the fear that presently overwhelmed America . The country was frightened silly of Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers , Communist spies and Congressional committees , flying saucers and fellow travelers , their friends and associates , and those who asked them for a match or the time of day . Intellectuals , scientists , teachers were investigated by numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign loyalty oaths . Democracy was defended by cripples who crippled it . At Cascadia College the American fear manifested itself , paradoxically , in what was missing : ideas , serious criticism , a liberal position . Levin remarked this only to Bucket , who nodded once . No one , for instance , disagreedwith Professor Fairchild 's daily dispraise of " Roosevelt socialism " ; if one did , disagreement was silent . Levin 's protectivecoloration was to pretend he thought like everyone else . Thep230specter of Duffy haunted his head , beware his fate . You have only one life to live , the instructor counseled himself , why lose it here , cut down in your prime at a cow college in a backwoodstown for bucking the petrified order ? For who , after all , was Levin but a poor man trying to make an honest living , a tough-enough proposition for him in the best of times . Thereforebe smart , mind your business , do n't make trouble . Yet because others were more timid than he ( who was striving , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) perhaps Levin , mixing feelings of weakness with intimations of strength , was brave by default ; for even as he whispered warnings to himself the word within sometimes was , " Speak up , do what you must to uphold the common good "  --  emphasis on the issues , Levin , conservative radical , loyal opposition , master of the gentle tactic , patient persuader , calm reasoner . He must on principle not be afraid . " The little you do may encourage the next man to do more . It does n't take a violent revolution to change a policy or an institution . All it takes is a good idea and a man with guts . Someone who knows that America 's historically successful ideas have been liberal and radical , continuing revolt in the cause of freedom . Disaster occurs if a country finally abandons its radical creative past '  --  R. Chase . Do n't be afraid of the mean-spirited . Remember that a man who scorns an idealist scorns the secret image of himself . ( Levin 's notebook : " Insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your purpose as self-improved man is to help the human lot , notwithstanding universal peril , anxiety , continued betrayalof freedom and oppression of man . He would , as a teacher , do everything he could to help bring forth those gifted few who would do more than their teachers had taught , in the name of democracy and humanity . ( Whistles , cheers , prolonged applause . ) The instructor took a bow at the urinal . Such being his mood these days he felt the need to make an issue of the book censorship business , all but convinced that Fairchild and Gilley would retreat if they ran into unexpectedopposition . But Levin though feeling free and energetic ,  |p231remembered  he was in love with Pauline Gilley and stood speechless . If not I , who shall lead ? he eventually asked . Listening to Fabrikant 's voice , the instructor wondered if he ought to ally himself with the scholar , and if Fabrikant managed to come into power , become useful through him ? There seemed no doubt that an election was on its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Bucket , was still eager to become the next head of department , and Levin thought he would offer his support , at least a vote added to Joe 's and a few others ' who seemed to take the scholar 's candidacy seriously . Levin had considered this course of action before but had n't made up his mind because he was still not entirely sold on Fabrikant . CD was n't exactly the open type ; he offered little of self . Sought out , he could be hospitable , laugh you his short laugh , even invite you to come again , but if you did n't he would n't miss you . He was not warm even to warmth . Scowers called him " soured  --  he has lost too many battles . " Leopold Kuck had remarked that privacy represented more than a privilegeto him . " He enjoys it as an exclusion of those he thinks do n't appreciate him . " Levin knew what they meant but tended to explain certain of Fabrikant 's limitations as brought on or intensified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter , his kind of luck . He was a man who had never run ahead of the life he lived . Maybe so , Levin thought , and he wears white socks , and his shoes squeak but what matters are his principles and record . He knew George Bullock did n't think much of either . George had once said that CD had never fought a major battle . " Okay , he 's got good marks for plugging for salary increases , more promotions , freer sabbatical rules , and a better retirement system than we now have on the books . He 's also for academic freedom , but who is n't outside of Congress ? I hear tell he did use to go see Marion Labhart every now and then and urge him to support this or that item , but once when he took a dim view of a policy of required attendance atp232department meetings , Marion blasted him out of his office , and , as I understand it , CD has never gone back in . If you want to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters he 's written in the past few years to the local rag and the college daily . On campus he 's against reports in triplicate , fraternities , and student apathy in college elections . His letters to the Commercial Budget protest the inefficiency of county government . He 's against indiscriminate garbage dumping and dogs that run loose and murder his chickens . He 's also got no use for chlorine and fluorides in the drinking water . What this country needs is a pure glass of water . ' If he 's written one letter on that subject , I swear I 've read five . Do you call that a record ? " On the other hand , Gilley , so far as Levin could learn , had fought not even for a pure glass of water . Beyond his good nature and lovely wife , he had little to recommend him . At the very least Fabrikant stood on principle . Gilley , totally congenial , was blown by every wind , in particular Fairchild 's . Fabrikant , though maybe a little eccentric  --  give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts . Gilley 's strength was to persist in his weaknesses . Fabrikant might grow as an administrator as he loosened to life , once it had at last rewarded him ; Gilley would remain as he was , gregarious , generous , ungrown . Of these two most possible choices it seemed to Levin the better was Fabrikant . Through the wall came his dry voice reading Emerson : " ' Whoever would be a man must be a non-conformist . He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness ... ' That is to say , " said Fabrikant , " not goodness ' but the name of goodness : " Nothing at last is sacred but the integrity of your mind . " ' " Amen , " sighed Levin . The bell in the hall rang . He checked his fly and turned to the sink . Standing there was Professor Fairchild , watching him with interest . " All yours , " Levin stammered.  |p233On  his way out of the building that afternoon he visited Fabrikant in his office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censored anthology . The scholar , his thick brows pressed together , listened gloomily . " It 's been that way as long as I can remember . " " Could n't you talk to Fairchild ? " " It would n't do any good . Once his mind 's made up he 's stubborn as a goat . " " Even if you talked to him ? " " Even if Teddy Roosevelt did . " " Should n't we at least try ? " " It would n't come to anything . I 'd advise you not to worry about that book . One battle is n't the war . " " Unless it is , " said Levin . " It is n't . This is n't the time to fight each petty tyranny or idiocy that comes along but to wait and overthrow the tyrant . " " You think it 's possible ? " " A lot depends on popular support . " Levin said quietly , " I would like to offer my  --  assistance in your campaign , in some way . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand just yet , though I will soon . I have one or two other irons in the fire . Fairchild has promised my long overdue promotion and I want to be sure that 's gone through before I antagonize him again . I should know in a month . " " Do n't wait too long , " Levin advised . " Anyway , " he said , " I 'm your man . I meant to tell you before this . " He felt not quite at ease saying it but said it . " Call me CD . " Fabrikant cordially offered a cigar . Levin refused a light but to be sociable sat with the cigar in his mouth . Feeling foolish , he thrust it into his breast pocket . " I 'd better be getting home . I have a load of papers to go through tonight . " " Feel free to come in . " The instructor thanked him . He almost walked into Gilley in the corridor . Levin tried to hide the cigar but failed thoughp234he crushed it into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levin , wondering which perfidy he knew , absently lifted his hat . If Gilley were alive to political affront , he showed not the slightest sign he was aware of a situation that insulted his manhood ; and Levin 's passion for his wife grew , fed by the secrecy it lived in . His heart was a taut string played hard by love , one further note of longing and it would snap in its face . Secrecy was an intensifying component , another that he saw her rarely now , and lived much in images of desire . At the time of his deepest need ( one way of tormenting himself was to imagine spending twenty-four normal hours in her company ) Gilley 's winter extension course ended and he did not reschedule it for spring . The trout season would n't open till April , and freshman recruitment was temporarily over until a last intensive week in May . Gerald was therefore either home with Pauline or out with her . She saw Levin for occasionalshort visits , but was now hesitant to give as her excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowie , whose house she was supposed to be at , had called one night , and Gilley was mystified until Pauline ( fresh from love with Levin ) said she had remembered the meeting had been postponedand so had dropped in at Jeannette 's . She had become again " deathly afraid . " It 's the town , Levin thought ; too tight to maneuver in . Too much is visible to the naked eye . When they met it still took her a while to stop being afraid . She looked sometimes as though it were all too much for her . Levin said that one night but she denied it . " It 's just that I sometimes worry what would happen to the children . " He had not much thought of them , but now he thought , though not much . She made him promise faithfully never to mention her name to anyone . Though the Gilleys entertained more frequently now , Paulinethought it best not to invite Levin . " It 's hard to pretend no-love when I feel so much for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , they saw each other less . As always he " had " again as have-not ; had n't bargained for this much longing , this much not having what was his to have . Missing her became work . He reveried a warm floral time when they 'd be inseparably together , in various stages of dress or undress , bed or board . My God , if I could only walk in the street with her . He dreamed of her as his wife , but on her belly was tattooed " Mrs. Gilley . " She wrote him suddenly , a spate of letters in official-looking brown envelopes , which he was not permitted to answer because Gillev nia ( le a point of going to the box after the mail delivery daring the lunch hour ; and Levin , after carrying it in his inside pocket , reading and rereading it , burned each letter in the fireplace because she had asked him to . The letters he could n't write her were a further loss . He was in his heart a poet these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's what you do n't say that counts . But she let him telephone if he made sure Gerald was either at his desk or in class . Levin went into a phone booth in the Student Union to make his call , his heart thumping like a hand on a bull fiddle . They exchanged endearmentand hung up . On Saturday mornings she called from downtown , if she could . If Mrs. Beaty , deaf or not , was too close by , she could tell from his voice and said goodbye . If not , each praised the other and both praised love . Afterwards Levin walked unknown distances . They had met rarely by chance before they became lovers , but in March , as though for compensation , he began to see her almost every time he left the house , and he left the house to see her . Walking downtown he would spot her driving the family Buick , tall in the seat , her straight hair touching her shoulders , nose pointing direction  --  where Levin must go . They met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She greeted him vaguely and hurried the kids on . He would pass her on the street and tip his hat . Last fall , when they had met , she had stopped to exchange a word ; he was the one in a hurry . Now her greetings were hesitant , formal . She hid love , a con/cealment painful to him . But there were times when for the slightest second her eyes were in love with him . Sometimes he saw her alone across the street ; he liked her brisk highheeledwalk . Each noticeable new thing about her was an event : what she wore : a split skirt showing a bit of white slip against her leg . Long dark blue socks awoke forest memories . He knew when she had washed her hair . Once in a food market , Gilley and both kids waiting outside in the car , when Levin approached Pauline dropped a can of tuna fish she had just taken off the shelf . It rolled along the floor . He bent for it , remembering the casserole she had ladled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave her the can their fingers touched and his heart grew flowers . Leaving the store , she glanced back at him . He lived on that for a week . One Saturday morning when she had not telephoned , Levin hurried downtown hoping for a glimpse of her . Wherever he went , she was n't . At noon he was returning in disappointment to his car when he passed a photographer 's shop displaying some enlarged shots of the Cascadia basketball team in its window . An intuition stopped Levin and he went to the window . Almost at once he discovered Pauline in a picture ( " Profs and Wives Cheer Team " ) , nothing less than revelation . While the photographer was posing a bridal party in the studio at the rear of the store , Levin entered , plucked the picture out of the window , folded it once , and slipped it into his pocket . He drove home in a hurry and in his room cut out her intense , open , lovely face . Levin then tore up Gilley , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracted her from . He kept this little picture of her hidden among the best thoughts in his notebook and would often gaze at it . Now and then he saw her at people 's houses , a star , a flower amid the full-breasted faculty wives . What they lacked she had . What she had n't nobody needed . It was high adventure for him when she walked in , even with Gilley , even if she hardly seemed to recognize her lover . Better that than not appear ; that broke the night . At these social gatherings talk wasp237small and wit rare , but hospitality and warmth were undeniable ; Levin eagerly laid hold of any invitation that ' might produce her . He was surprisingly often invited where she was , almost as though people sensed romance and fostered it , though he hoped not . Whenever they met the action was as before : although they had talked together casually in the past , now , as on the street , she gave him little more than hello , how are you ? She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ; always conscious of what she was doing , when alone , talking to Jeannette , Alma or another woman , or to men and which men , when in the kitchen , on the sofa , or momentarily gone to the bathroom . IIe must know where she was . From where Levin observed , standing among others apart from her , sitting near her at a dinner table , trying not to stare , or watching from the next room , her face was gentle and luminous , sometimes a little sad ; he created her quality as love created him ; her loveliness enriching her clothes , the air around her . Once she drew back a lock of hair to adjust a barrette and revealed an ear pinned like a jewel to her head . Another time she was wearing her hair in a bun and he whispered , " Your neck is stupendous . " Pauline , in spite of herself , laughed . Lord , thought Levin , how beautiful women are , and how hungry my heart is . But how short life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience to go on hungering ? Love entitled him to create her beauty but never to embrace it when he most desired . They sat in circles and talked ; or , depending on the specialty of the house , watched slides , listened to records , or acted charades . He was pleased when his play acting amused her . There was no mood to a party but Levin 's own . Once after dancing with her at Bullocks , he followed her into a bedroom . Pauline returned his kiss then drew back . " Please do n't when Gerald 's around . " She walked out as he wiped his lips clean . He felt there was no future in their love , until a few minutes later , when as they met in a momentarily empty hall , she took his hand and pressed it to her cheek  |p238Although  during the evening he could blot Gilley out of his mind , what most tormented him was their leaving together , Levin locked out , a dirty trick on a lover . At midnight one of the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole company rose in a body . That ended the party , a blow to a bachelor who slept with his beard . Gilley gave his wife the eye and she went for her coat . They left for what lands , what voyages Levin could n't make . He sometimes walked downtown and ordered a meal , to eat up his hunger . One night at Bullocks she stayed as far from him as she could . She clung to Gilley , on her fourth drink without George 's assistance . He recalled the time she had said she hoped for a revival of Gerald 's love . He does n't deserve it , Levin thought ; but he felt she loved short of his love for her  --  his usual fate . Pauline saw him watching her and went into another room . She stayed apart from him all night . He was embittered , desolate . At midnight when the Bullocks served their elaborate buffet  --  coffee and cake was the customary nightcap elsewhere  --  Pauline filled up a plate and brought it to Gilley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm around her . Levin , jealous of the years and substance of her Gerald had had , put down his glass and went out into the garden . It had begun to drizzle . As he was thinking he would leave from the garden and come around tomorrow for his coat , he heard footsteps on the patio . She was in his arms before he could turn . " Forgive me , darling , Gerald 's been awfully sweet , and I 've felt very guilty . At times I hate myself . " " Do n't feel bound to me . " " The truth is I do . " " Then do n't feel guilty . " " If it were only that easy . " " Is that why you 're drinking ? " " To forget you a little . " They kissed . " I 'd better go , " she said.  |p239He  took her hand . " You 're so lovely . " " I feel lovely with you . " " My heart aches for you . " " I for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll try tonight . " " Do n't if you feel bad . " Pauline said she would try . It was past two when she tapped on the glass . She had slept in Erik 's room after Gilley had fallen asleep . When Erik called for his water she gave it to him , then changed the baby in her sleep and left . " I can only stay a few minutes . " " Did you take the car ? " " I was afraid of the noise it would make . " " I 'll drive you back . " " Not all the way . " But she had not touched her earrings . " Are n't you going to undress ? " She looked at him then looked away . " I ca n't tonight . Gerald wanted to and I could n't say no . " He was struck by a grave sadness . A few nights later she came in at nine . " I 'm supposed to be at a late movie he does n't want to see , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a time of fulfillment . Afterwards Levin said , " I hate to see you so scared . We 've got to think of something we can do . " " What , for instance ? " " Whatever you say . " " What about your plans ? " " Sometime we 'll have to tell him the truth . " " Not yet , " she said . Then she said , " Let 's wait till summer , then we 'll talk about it . " " Why till summer ? " " To see how things go . " " Do n't you think we have a future together ? "  | " Sometimes I do and sometimes not . " " When do you think so ? " " When it suddenly looks possible . I feel calm and see it that way . " " When does n't it ? " " When I feel you ought to have someone with fewer problemsto bring you . " " Forget that . How does it look now ? " " Possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before she left he asked , " Are you sure you love me ? " " So much it takes me time to think how much . Why do you ask so often ? " " All my life I 've been engaged in wanting . " " Love makes a long journey in you . " " Your love inspires me . It always will . " " Do n't make me cry , darling , " Pauline said . She left at midnight , it was raining . She had stayed longer than she had intended ; but she had taken the precaution of dropping in at the Stowers before , to say she had been there too if Gerald asked anything . " The lies shame me most , " she said . He lit her way down the stairs with a flashlight and watched her leave the yard , regretting her going . Tonight the room was empty after she had gone . Levin switched off the light and tried to fall quickly asleep . He was beginning to doze when he heard a knock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray hair in braids , held her battery box in her hand . She was upset . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Levin , but I have my self-respect to think of . I asked Mrs. Gilley not to come here again . I 'm sorry for her and I 'm sorry for you , but it 's not right , and I have the reputation of my house to think of . " He listened with battered heart and stone ear . " A few nights ago when I awoke to get my medicine Ip241thought I saw her coming out of the alley with you . Since then I waited up every night , and tonight I missed her going in but I heard her high heels come down your stairs . At first I was going to talk to you , but then I decided to talk to her . She is n't the right person for you , Mr. Levin , and you 'll get into real trouble at the college if you go on with her . Whether you do or you do n't , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would have been merciful if you had spoken to me . " " I 'm not sure that a married woman carrying on deserves much mercy . I feel sorry for Mr. Gilley . " " What did she say when you spoke to her ? " " All she did was run away . " Levin groaned . After the old woman went downstairs he felt a furious desperation . What had happened now seemed inevitable . He dressed and left the house . Levin walked in the rain to Pauline 's . Her house was dark except for the white tree on the front lawn . He stood across the street , wanting her through walls . Half the night he wandered in the rain . In the morning he was impatient to call her but Gilley was n't at his desk during his office hours and Levin did not want to risk it . Later he found a letter in his office mailbox , a blue envelope addressed in block letters . She had never written him here before . " Just a word , dearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . I was afraid of something like this . I ca n't tell you how bad I feel , God knows how I 'll get through the night . I 'm writing this in Erik 's room . Call me Thurs. between 9 &; 10 , no later . I just had to get in touch . I love you . I miss you so . Destroy this . Pauline . " He kissed the letter . Thursday at nine he called . Hearing her voice made him feel as though they had been separated for years . " When can I see you ? " he asked . " Lev , I 'm frightened to death . Let 's be careful . Not for a while is best . "  | " I could look for another room or maybe a small apartment with a private entrance ? " " If you move now she may tell people . If she lets you stay I doubt she 'd talk . Has she said anything to you ? " " Just only what happened . She has n't asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have plans , Lev . " " I mean in case something happens . " " I do n't want anything else to happen , nothing , nothing . " " Do n't be scared . " " I was brought up to be . " " If I could just see you . " " Not for a while , please . Just call me Tuesdays and Thursdays , about this time . I may write but please do n't you . I 'm terribly sorry  --  I should n't have come so often . She was n't nasty but I felt awful . I 'm sorry I 'm not somebody else , I mean someone not married . You do n't deserve this . " " I deserve you . " " I 'd better hang up . I do n't want to cry on the phone . " Though he telephoned twice a week for a brief word of love , he saw her only in passing , in motion away from him . He thought of her with such intensity it was like waking when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the sound of her voice on the phone and an occasional letter to the office , which he dutifully tore up . Beyond the word he lived on memory : her heart easing presence in his arms . Levin inspired , by her embrace , breath , beauty , the smell and feel of her , their consummation , and aftermath , when because of love 's possibilities the previous minute 's love was deepened . Otherwise hunger . " I never see you , " he said on the phone . " Where are you besides in my heart ? " " Here , " she said , " at this end . " " We 've got to meet . " " Where would we go ? " " I 'll find some place , " he said.  | " A beautiful place , a forest . " At night Levin haunted her street . After a walk to river , or the hills , he came to her house when it was late and unlikely Gilley would step out with milk bottles or the cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick with deephuedpink blossoms . He watched for a touch of Pauline , a glimpse of her dress as she passed the half-shaded window , or whatever morsel luck would let fall into his empty hands . In his thoughts he crossed the street and entered his house . She was waiting for him . They ate together , then when the kids were in bed , talked , read , listened to music . They went to bed and made love without ache or fear  --  was there ever such a life ? Anyway , it was love and he had it , until he was standing alone across the street as she lay in bed with a stranger ... Levin was startled by a touch on the arm . A cop , staring at his beard , said a taxpayer had called and complained of a peeping Tom . " Not me , " said Levin . " Could I see some I.D. ? " Levin produced his automobile license . The cop looked at it and returned the card . " Could you tell me why you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a beautiful night . " " Right in the middle of the sidewalk ? " " I love this tree . " " The lady that phoned said you had been here more than an hour . She thought you might be casing one of the houses across the street . " " That long ? " said Levin . He left , heavy hearted . One early spring night when a brimming moon in the white sky gilded houses , trees , and spring flowers , a moon-drenched Levin wandered along Pauline 's street and paused at the flowering plum . He crossed the street and stood , hat in hand , a few feet from her partly-open , dark bedroom window . Come to the window for a minute , my dearest , and I 'll bep244content for a month . But no one appeared , though he thought of it often . In the stillness he heard the rhythmic creaking of a bed , and then on the night  --  a bird , catch it , hold it  --  the soft cry of a woman at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired moment , satisfied her for him . They made plans to be together but for one reason or another abandoned them . She was afraid they might be seen wherever they met . " It would be absolutely cruel if Gerald found out through gossip . " " Am I never to be with you ? " " Be patient , Lev . " He cursed the day Mrs. Beaty had seen her in the alley . One morning when he was famished for a look at her , she let him watch from down the block as she entered the food market . When she came out , she looked in his direction for several seconds , then walked to her car . This ca n't go on , he thought . Learning on Thursday morning that she was going with Gilley to a post-season basketball game on Saturday night , Levin hurried to the Basketball Palace and with luck got a reserved seat in the balcony , facing the faculty section . On Saturday night he was there early , amid an enormous crowd of students and townspeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birdwatching binoculars . Once the glasses met a pair directed at him , a hard eye for an eye . A chill ran through him as he recognized the flushed half-bald dome and expressionless features of Dr. Marion Labhart . Levin had sulfurous visions of himself as Arthur Dimmesdale Levin , locked in stocks on a platform in the town square , a red A stapled on his chest , as President Labhart stood over him , preaching a hellfire sermon denouncing communist adulterers , the climax of which was the public firing of Levin out of the college . Next to the president sat Dean Lawrence Seagram of the Liberal Arts Service Division . When Levin first saw him in September the dean was a clean-shaven youngish type ; now he was middle-aged and wore a grizzled Van Dyke but at least looked human.  |p245Seeking  Pauline , Levin located Gilley with an empty seat at his side , a gap for Levin . Above in the next row were both Bullocks . Levin , focusing on the empty seat , wondered what had happened to Pauline ; he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his side he learned that Cascadia was playing Los Angeles for the Western Conference Championship . The floor of the court blazed with reflected light , practice went on , and two bands blared . Among the rally girls on the Cascadia side Levin recognized Nadalee Hammerstad . She shook red pompoms , danced and twirled , revealingher slim thighs and frisky black-tighted behind . She performed directly below Pauline 's empty seat , and Levin was uneasy at how life related events and people . When the game started , Pauline had still not come . He considered running downstairs to telephone to make sure she was all right but he was caught in the prevailing excitement and stayed . The L.A. band had antagonized him . Costumed in hard straw hats , red bow ties , shorts and hairy legs , it created a jazz uproar , drowning out the pep songs of the whiteshirtedCascadians . If the strategy was to keep their own players hopped up , they did the same for all present , setting Levin 's teeth on edge , and arousing in him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle Los Angeles broke into the lead , and Levin , realizing the home town was the underdog , found himself cheering it . For a minute he studied himself with a sour eye yet went on as before . Though he had not since college watched basketball , he was gripped by the game . More than once he jumped out of his seat to cheer a good play or boo a had call . What a bad call was he left to the crowd . He shouted encouragement to the players , in particular Whitey Barker , a skinny , long-chested type , a solid C minus student in Levin 's last term 's class , but on the court , canny , alert , graceful , wise . He defended like a matador enclosing the bull , and on offense hit baskets with every kind of shot . His rebounding was outstanding . The instructorwaving his hat , cheered himself hoarse for his formerp246student  --  although he suspected the boy had complained to Bullock about the grade he had got , because George had been cold to Levin for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peering with his binoculars at the faculty section to study George 's face , he discovered Pauline sitting next to Gerald . A little ashamed of having forgotten her , he focused his glasses and was moved by her drawn face . She had lost weight . He could hear the game going on , ten men thundering back and forth , pitching a ball at two hoops , but now he kept his glasses tightly on her , taking his excitement from her presence . Pauline seemed , after a while , to be squirming this way and that ; he realized she had become aware of him and was trying either to shrink or hide from his magnified eyes . Levin lowered his glasses and absent-mindedly watched the last few minutes of play . At the end he did not know who had won . As he was leaving the Palace he thought he had at least shared the town 's big emotion . He would not , if he could , deny them basketball if once in a while the big emotion came from a good book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew talking to another . " Did you see that cat with the black whiskers who had those binocks in front of us ? That 's my comp prof . " " So what ? " " He 's supposed to be nuts about some dame . Maybe he could see her naked in those glasses . " When Levin arrived home , he snipped off his beard with scissors and shaved the rest . When they met , on a street at the southern edge of town , Pauline looked at him in disbelief then wept , though Levin said it was n't too bad . He had searched long in the mirror , felt ill but lived . Too much face , the eyes still sad candles , blunt bent nose , lips without speech telling all , but the jaw looked stronger , possibly illusion.  | " Why did you do it ? " she asked . " It had gotten to look so rich and silky . I hope it is n't bad luck . " He waited until she stopped talking about it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suggested the woods or the riverbank but it rained every day and they had to settle for motels near outlying towns . This was during a time Gilley was beginning to go fishing again . Levin registeredand she stayed in the car , her face averted . Alone , they kissed , he tasting on her tongue the Scotch she had had to relax her . She was still mistress of the quick lay , and once it was over he dozed by her side , dreaming of her . Longing was long , the consummation brief . Satisfaction bred quick hunger . It saddened him he could n't be contented for more than minutes . Levin held her in his arms , longing for Pauline . The thought of all the time that would go by before he saw her again oppressed him . She wanted , of course , not to be nervous but usually was . " I hate motels . Your room was so nice . I felt at home in it . " He offered to move to Marathon , where nobody knew them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'd be miles away and I 'd have less time to be with you . And after a while , no matter where you lived , somebody would find out I was coming to see you and this would start again . " One night when there was not much time and they had worked themselves into desire in Levin 's car , parked by the riverbank , she joked about the back seat , then grew depressed . The result was nothing achieved , his loss , for she seemed soon to feel better , as though she had exchanged nothing for something . He had lost more than a lay . But loss enlarged love , or so they said . And part of the experience of paradise was when it was no longer paradise . This thought had come to him in a former time when he was struggling to accept fate without making less of experience . She said , as he was driving her to the street where she usually got out and walked home , " I 've been thinking if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of leaving him . Please do n't oppose him for the headship . I 'm sure he 'll be good at it . " " There are better men around , " Levin said . " Last night I dreamed he found us in bed and took the children away from me " " That wo n't happen . " " I always knew I would fall in love again but I was n't prepared to feel ravaged so soon . " " Love is life . " " I wish you had n't cut your beard . " " What can I do to make things easier for you ? " Levin asked her . " I could stay away for a month , even till summer if you 'd feel any better . Then in the summer we could come to a decision . " " Could you stay away that long ? " " I could for you . " " I do n't think I could stand it , I 'd worry about you . " " What worry ? " " About how you were and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would . " " No , I do n't want that kind of worry . I 'd rather have this . " Afterwards he wanted to send her something  --  flowers  --  but what would she say if Gilley asked her where they had come from ? So he settled for a pair of gold hoop earrings which he bought for more than he could afford . But when could she wear them except with him , and where would she hide them later ? He kept them for her in his notebook drawer . The next time they talked on the phone she said , " Do n't think of me as poor Pauline , think of me as rich . I may have fears but I have you . I have lovely thoughts of you . I want to give you what you have n't had . I want to make up for all you 've been through in the past . I want to make you happy with me . " He said he was happy . In bed , the next time , she failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levin was disappointed.  | " Do n't make anything out of it , " she said , " I 've been sleeping badly and I 'm usually tired . The kids tire me , and it 's not easy to live with one man and be always thinking of another . I worry he senses something is wrong . And I worry about the strain on you . " " Do n't worry about me . " " " Now you have her , now you do n't is no life for a man . And I worry about a definite break with Gerald . I guess I was not passionately attached to him but I 've never been able to unlove anyone I ever loved . " " We 'll settle it in the summer . " " I already have settled it but my nervous system has n't . That 's what flopped just now  --  not me . But I 'll be myself next time . " Next time was in a little hotel about thirty miles out of Easchester  --  she was insisting they not go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , Pauline , her brow wet , said , " Do n't wait for me , I do n't think I can . " " Are you sure ? " " Come without me . " Finally he did . " I 'm really beat , " she said . " Is that it ? " She said , " Gerald is ardent again . I think he senses something . I told you he might . Sometimes I get so tired of sex . " Now we have truly come to adultery , Levin thought . " I would have skipped it if you had asked me , " he said . She caressed his beardless face . Her eyes were tired , her nose thin . " Please do n't worry . I go through these periods . I was in a bad period with Gerald just before the first time with you . But he 's used to me and does n't seem to mind . " " I mind . " " Do n't idealize sex , Lev . " " Not sex , you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end-of-April night , Levin lay awake while she slept , grinding her teeth.  |p250She  had looked imperiled . He felt he had to do something to help her or this might get beyond her . Since it was almost certainly too late to start writing around for a new job , if he could get an assistantship somewhere , and Pauline a part-time job , things might work out . But making new plans worried Levin ; it was as if those he had come West with had been wrong to begin with . If that was the case would he ever in his life make the right plans ? Yet he felt for her a deep tenderness and dreamed of a decent life for them . When he awoke it was almost six-thirty and Pauline was frantic . They were racing through a thick fir forest . Levin had said he would take her to the Easchester bus station where she could get a cab , and she had in silence agreed , her face calmly locked in fright . " What will you do if he 's awake ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could I go in with you ? " " No . " Above the trees the light brightened , yellow , then foggy gold . " the rising , not the setting sun , ' " " he said . " Who said so ? " " B. Franklin . " " He was wrong . " The fake forest , Levin thought . As he was speeding out of it , a siren sounded behind them . A state trooper in an unmarked car waved the Hudson to the side . Levin cursed . Pauline shut her eyes . Any minute he expected to see gray in her hair . The trooper talked for ten minutes before handing Levin the ticket . Pauline stared ahead , her stomach rumbling . She bent to hide it but could n't . Finally they were off again at fifty . " I 'd better go in with you . " " No , please no. "  |p251They  parted at the Easchester bus station . She hurried into a cab , forgetting goodbye , Until We Meet Again , or even to wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull gray morning . Afterwards Levin sweated it out in his room . He had visions of disaster for all , particularly himself . Yes , she loved him , but she also loved Gilley and she loved the kids . If she had loved Levin as he loved her , she would already have made up her mind to leave Gilley . To go on as they had been , would prolongthe torture and destroy what was left of the joy of love . He stayed in the house Saturday and Sunday , waiting for a word from her but none came . Only Pauline lived in his thoughts . He thought of her as she had been when they were first in love and how worn out and unhappy she had looked lately . Levin struck himself for the harm he had done her . He promised that if , by some stroke of luck she had got in without Gilley knowing it , he would not see her till summer . The rest would do her good . When he went to work on Monday morning , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got in safely . Out of love he gave her up.  |p252May  sunbursts flooded the windows , making the mourner invisible ; he sat , when he came in , unable to move , even a breath unsettling pain . He secretly waited for a word , a sign she loved him , would never let him give her up . She had once seized his flesh : " I 'll never let you go . " He waited for her to redeem the pledge . Through long days he waited , loving her , giving her up , trying to forget the last hours with her , memory repeating memory . But when she appeared  --  through Mrs. Beaty on guard , thick walls , a ring of flame , the salt sea  --  he sneaked her home past her husband at indecent hours ; then in his mind ( to save her from this ) parted from her forever , the worst place to part from anyone . The landlady left a plate of oatmeal cookies at his door . He secretly waited . She did not write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her escape he ate himselfp253slowly ; his heart like a vessel of pain against bare bones ; the mourner attended his perpetual funeral . He had expected in the ruined aftermath a diminished misery , reason the shield , since he had himself brought the affair to its broken end ; but a surgeon operating on himself does not excise the pain , and now he knew the majesty of his . Having betrayed his nature , his deepest need , he had surrendered something of life to death . In pain he mortified what he was attempting to kill , his short-lived love , self-created freedom . Ah , the soaring anticipation of Pauline Gilley ; possessing her in feeling 's fullness ; dreaming of what he had had . Dreams dead by suicide . Silence burdened ache . Why had she not told him she had got in safely , knowing how intensely worried he would be ? He could only explain it that she had given him up at the same moment he had abandoned her , breaking off before impossiblegot worse , ultimately relieved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had left her , in the end , unsatisfied . Why does the last event condition the quality of the past ? In his most desperate moments he felt a hatred of her that relieved the fundamental pain , but with such frightening other effects he preferred the pain . In the midst of which , in some shaded place within , dwelt Levin 's Pauline , tender , lovely girl of the graceful shoulders and shapely can , their own fine art ; the woman he had least expected to be in love with , source of his discoveries of her beauty ( as when her hand or the wind touched her hair ) . Thoughts such as these made his loss unbearable . After he had endured all he thought he could , there was more ; he had in a former existence lowered the threshold of heartbreak . Ah , sweet mastery of life  --  if only Levin could . The more he suffered , no matter how frequent or pure his resolutions to change himself , the more he suffered . For whateverunknown or unpredictable cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bad cause , causing what caused him pain ( " Which way I the is Hell ; myself am Hell . " ) ; somewhere along the line he had erred , his life gone wrong , wronger . Andp255when Levin erred the result was serious , no matter how often he promised to take life more lightly , less frantic seeking of a hold to throw it with . He laughed seriously and suffered merrily , miserere . The sorrows of Levin : his mouth thickened with thirst . He hid a brown bottle under the bed , then slept with it . Ache turned at teasing times to prurience ( original original sin ) within which he imaged a bearded billy goat chewing Someone'spubic hair , the lady responding to the tickle and other jests in 167 satisfying ways . He plowed through the black pants she wore . Pricked with pins her bubless nipples . Clobbered her with sex , though she sobbed no , then begged for more , satisfaction levitating her a foot in the air . Amid such pleasures Mrs. Beaty 's white cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door , fat headless robin . He asked the landlady to keep the cat out of the house but pussy in love was faithful , finding more ways in than he could block off , depositing another bloody-breasted bird . " Eat my heart , " he cried and kicked the beast down the stairs . Ascending on three legs she delivered a mangled rat , then went into heat , her raucous cries sounding throughout the house . He consideredtaking off with packed bags , but to return where he had failed was failure . Depression dug a fast hole and in it be sat drowning . Alas , Levin , ever-drowning sailor . What had he done to his poor self ? .. . But time , though he hid from it , rained him in the face and change changed against the will . He rose once more to the surface , not the same man but who was ? Apathy followed , worse yet . " A grief without a pang , void , dark , and drear , / A stifled , drowsy , unimpassioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , / In word , or sigh , or tear . " This went on too long , till he was ready to secede from the world ; until a fissure appeared in the windowless wall and he wriggled through . No-feeling , purged , left mildewed melancholy . Each day introduced its own variation and quantity of ache . He feltp256sadness for every living thing . Even a tree , when Levin looked , looked sad . He was his own pathetic fallacy . The bright flags of loneliness unfurled and flapped in the breeze . He knew it in every size and shape , hard , soft , black , blue , concrete city-type recalled ; and woodsy-leafy countrykind . He had lived in dark small rooms in anonymous tenementson gray streets amid stone buildings crowding the sky ; loneliness tracked him in the guise of strangers . In the country it dwelt in the near distance under vast umbrella skies . In the city , compressed ; spacious in the country . Space plus whatever you feel equals more whatever you feel , marvelous for happiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed for her to share the burden of his incompletion , the cheat of being human ; longed for a past that was now memory pickled in regret . The unhappy clever purpose of the disease was to compel him to expel it . It would never succeed . Despite all his exertions to forget her , Levin remembered and desired ; the town was small and she lived nearby . He had one day seen Erik scraping the sidewalk in her long shoes . To get away from what he could not escape he drove his car on dusty country roads leading nowhere . Sometimes he stopped and shouted in the stillness . Lonely crows flew up from the fields . White farmhouses and rain-stained barns were lonely , cows and horses , every living thing . Trees were lonely , fences , so was the horizon . That somehow was the worst . The dust blew up behind him as he sped home . He knew that the only way to fight his sadness of spirit was to be among people but he did nothing to be . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . Though an occasional invitation to someone 's house came his way he did not accept , not to see her . He was certain she did n't want to see him ; this made him deathly lonely . He often doubted she had truly loved him . He was at times desperately moved to write her but wrote nothing . If she wanted it ended , he would keep it ended . He would help her resist him if she were resisting.  |p257Levin  resisted with the same arguments : She was , for the thousandth time , a married woman with a family . She had caused herself to love out of discontent , although her discontentswere tolerable . Gilley was good to her ; she had a better than average home , kids she loved . Maybe she was bored but she was n't desperate ; she probably could go on living with him forever . If diversion was what she had wanted , a little love on the side , she was n't made for it , the pleasure butchered by anxiety and shame . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for love . And he doubted he could inspire such love , the limits of her passion conditioned by the man he was . He might awaken love but not madness , although maybe it was mad to chance what she had chanced ; maybe she understood he too was unwilling to give " all . " He had lived through too much , become wary to the frazzled ends of his nerves of too many " lessons . " He was , in love , not Seymour Gordon Lord Byron , but a modest man and would not complain if all he got was no more than he gave . He left to Casanova or Clark Gable the gourmandise , the blasts and quakes of passion . He wanted love like a fountain in the wind . He wanted in a woman loveliness and feeling , of course , but character , constancy . He wanted someone free to love so he could freely love . Whenever Levin saw Gilley he thought of his treachery to him ; it was wrong to have continued to see his wife under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the hiding and guilt had hurt them both . He would have done better to have kept his door shut against her ; only if she were willing to give up Gilley was the way . If she were , there might have been no problem . If she were that willing he might have run from her , over the hills and far away ; at least tipped his hat and backed off . In the street they would nod to each other , a lanky lady and a bearded gent , and hurry by . He would not then have been incapacitated before her husband when there was an issue to fight for , a principle to defend . Somebody should have fought for the retention of the short story anthology ; he was the coward in that affair . Now , if he expected to be of
