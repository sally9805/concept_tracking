" Then came a promise to campaign up and down America " until we drive the crooks and the Communists " out of Washington , a plug for Ike , and he was off . Nixon had not only succeeded in making his family sound exactly like the average middle-class American family of the fifties , but , as one commentator noticed , " the common man was a Republican , for a change . " Although the speech created bad feeling for Nixon as well as good ( many thought it vulgar and tasteless ) , it made him regarded as the country 's most skillful television politician . Later , he used much the same technique for another successful appearance to tell the story of his involvement with Whittaker Chambers , a key witness in the Hiss conviction . The Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireside chat " with Adlai Stevenson , which was in stark contrast to the theatricality of the Nixon appearance . Nixon 's technique was much discussed at the time . It was noticed that he preferred to talk to only one camera , to eliminate the distraction of switching from one camera to another for a variety of angles . Some of those close to Nixon believe that these successes on television went to his head . A close associate in a later campaign said Nixon made the gross miscalculation of thinking that his efforts had been crucial to Eisenhower 's election in 1952 . In fact , there was a serious effort to drop him from the ticket in 1956 . Television , however , may have had less of an effect on the outcome of the 1952 election than the candidates ' preoccupation with the medium would suggest . A study by Miami University of Ohio concluded that television was less of a factor in projecting the Eisenhower personality than were newspapers . Although people who watched television thought they were making the largest gains of information , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicating the issues . Stevenson gained more from television because he began the campaign less // well known than Eisenhower . Another factor was television 's ability to circumvent an unfriendly press . Fair TV and the unfair press Often cited as one of television 's most important contributions to campaigning in the United States has been its injection of an element of fairness . American newspapers have been overwhelmingly Republican in ownership , and although some enlightened owners might permit Democratic candidates a fair hearing in their news columns , the number of papers endorsing Republicans was always greater . It is interesting to speculate how much broadcasting may have contributed to the Democratic hold on the White House since 1932 . It has been estimated that 90 percent of the nation 's newspapers were opposed to FDR . By 1936 , press hostility was so virulent that James A. Farley , the Democratic Party Chairman , later wrote that FDR 's reelection that year would have been impossible without radio . His broadcast election speeches , of course , were reinforced between campaigns by the " fireside chats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President could take his case , unedited , directly to the people made such an impact that those who lived through the New Deal often think they occurred very regularly . Like President Kennedy 's televised news conferences a generation later , the " fireside chats " outshone the more orthodox means of Presidential communication . In fact , during twelve years in office , FDR gave only thirty such broadcasts , and in the years before the Second World War gave , on the average , only two a year.3 They were massively outnumbered by the President 's efforts to woo American newspapers . He held a total of 990 press conferences , averaging more than eighty a year .4 The same issue was still alive in 1964 but the open battle between the conservative and liberal Republicans produced a complication in press loyalties . Faced with the desertion of even staunchly Republican newspapers , Barry Goldwater leaned on television . He told me once : " I would say that 75 percent of the press of this country are against me . The columnists with one or // two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are definitely , so I had to go on television . I found so much distortion of what I had been doing that I had to resort to the televised press conference , in some cases cutting down on regular press conferences . So I went to television merely because I could not depend upon objective reporting 100 percent . " Televised press conferences did not always help , because in public , Goldwater 's mind tended to wander creatively into paths he had not explored privately beforehand . Highly controversial new elements were often thus dropped casually into the campaign . But he believed that the press was the enemy : " I would pick up a paper , for example , the morning after having made a speech . The headline would be a complete distortion of what I said yet the story , the body , would be all right . So if I 'm going to be faced with this fact of life , then I have to use what I call the greatest lie detector ever developed ? television . " The growing tendency of television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause politicians to think less rhapsodically of the medium as a means to bypass the press . Many Congressmen are opposed to television 's finding an editorial voice , even though stations are required by law and government regulation to give both sides of controversial issues . One of the troubles of American television in the informational field is that politicians want to use it only on their own terms and have made sure that at election time at least it is largely kept that way . The ad agencies move in By the time Eisenhower and Stevenson were running again in 1956 , the parties had made a big effort to jazz up their TV campaigning . For the President 's sixtieth birthday , for example , in October , at the height of the campaign , they put on a nationwide television show with a heavy emphasis on show business . Appearing with the President were stars like Helen Hayes , Irene Dunne and James Stewart . One of the main issues in that campaign was the President 's // health . Late in 1955 , Eisenhower had suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to continue in office and to run for reelection , he addressed the nation on television in February , 1956 . The President said that he would not campaign " in the customary pattern " but would rely heavily on the " means of mass communications " to inform the American people of the issues . The country could see that he looked well and there was much comment about how useful television was in such a situation . Still , the whole question was reopened in June when Eisenhower had to undergo an emergency operation for ileitis . He had not finished convalescing when the campaign began . If he had campaigned solely through television , it would have fed the rumors about his fitness to continue as Chief Executive . Adlai Stevenson drew attention to the issue by waging a vigorous campaign . In the event , the President was forced to make several campaign trips to be seen to be well enough to do so . Television coverage of his campaigning , of course , helped to spread that message . Aided possibly by the Suez and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign , Eisenhower defeated Stevenson by a wider margin than in 1952 . The President had steadily improved his own technique on television . Although he still said that it made him feel like an actor , commentators felt that his appearances were becoming increasingly effective . The parties began to feel the greater campaign costs imposed by increased use of television , but the medium itself came to their rescue . An interesting innovation in 1956 was a fund-raising dinner , called a " Salute to Eisenhower , " which was held simultaneously in fifty-two cities linked by closed circuit television . The interconnection cost the GOP a quarter of a million dollars but 70,000 Republicans paid $100 each for their dinners and the party netted $5 million . For financial or other reasons , political exploitation of television was still somewhat restrained in the Presidential campaigns of the 1950 's . All the techniques were in use ? the straight political talk , the staged conversations , filmed programs , telethons and the short commercial . However , the medium had not yet come to dominate // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated for the Presidency in that decade may have been a restraining influence . It is more likely that the men who could visualize the wedding of television with the mass advertising techniques were still not influential enough with the parties . The advertising agencies were very important in campaign planning but not paramount ; pollsters were not yet elevated to become strategists and policymakers . Politics had not yet been taken out of the hands of the lawyers . What that development needed was a new breed of campaign manager , part public relations man , part advertising executive , part pollster , part film-maker , part computer programmer . The new manager began to emerge in the planning for the 1960 Presidential election . A man who gave politics a lot of thought after 1956 was Carroll Newton , a senior executive in one of the country 's biggest advertising agencies , Batten , Barton , Durstine and Osborn . Newton had worked for the agency on both Eisenhower campaigns but felt that television could be used more creatively . In 1956 , he had begun to discover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to turn off . Newton wanted to carry that further , to eliminate the candidate 's " earnest " talks to the camera , and , instead , to use film to build his image . Newton wanted to " market " a candidate . To the advertising industry , that is a perfectly respectable exercise based on thorough research , careful testing of attitudes and a blend of highly developed arts and sciences in a campaign . The perfect candidate for such a campaign would be the Republicans ' vital young Vice-President , the " wonder boy " of political television , who was certain to be the Presidential nominee . Nixon was thinking along the same lines . Even before the 1956 campaign , he knew that buying air time was only the beginning of a modern television campaign . In September , 1955 , he had told a group of broadcasting executives in New York that " candidates should be prepared to spend as much money on building up a program , through advertisements and organization work , as they do on air time . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the 1960 campaign , there was a meeting of minds . // Another of the new breed was becoming seriously interested in politics at the same time . In 1958 , the market research firm of Louis Harris had been hired by John F. Kennedy to take polls and analyze public opinion in Massachusetts before Kennedy 's campaign for the Senate . In October , 1959 , as Kennedy began to plan his assault on the Presidency , Harris was called into the most intimate councils . In the twelve months that followed , Harris took and analyzed more samples of American public opinion than had ever been attempted in a political campaign . According to Theodore White : " Upon his description of the profile of the country 's thinking and prejudices as he found them , were to turn many of John F. Kennedy 's major decisions . " 5 At least in the early planning , both the Nixon and Kennedy campaigns of 1960 were based on fresh thinking about how the techniques of manipulating America 's mass consumer market could be applied to politics . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , if his own hesitations had not undermined the efforts of his creative team . But in those campaigns the union of television , polls and advertising was firmly cemented . For all who dared , or could afford , to use it , a new image-making machinery was available to the politicians of the 1960 's . An end to older-looking men ? It was a warm day in late June , 1964 , in Senator Barry Goldwater 's office on Capitol Hill . The convention in San Francisco which was to put the formal stamp on Goldwater 's nomination for President was still several weeks away but that day in his office on Capitol Hill , he was relaxed . Leaning back in a leather chair , surrounded by mementos of his carefree days as junior Senator , jet flier , student of the Southwest Indians and photographer , Goldwater talked knowledgeably about the problems facing a modern candidate . As often happened that spring and summer , his conversation kept turning to the politics of his own state , as though some part of his political instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACHINE son and was already sorting the problems of returning to the Senate . When he got around to the effects of television , the example he turned to was Arizona 's senior Senator , Carl Hayden , then eighty-six , who would be up for reelection in 1968 . " Some of our best Senators are older men , " Goldwater said . " My colleague , for example , Carl Hayden . I consider him to be one of the most outstanding Chairmen of the Appropriations Committee we 've ever had . But he 'd have a hard time running against a younglooking person . I do n't like this but it 's a fact of life . " He added that the off-year elections two years earlier " probably marked the end of older-looking men being elected to national office . " Carl Hayden has been in Congress longer than the state of Arizona has been in the Union . He is deeply respected . Yet he has begun to look old and frail . As one of Goldwater 's Arizona strategists put it : " We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he looked so decrepit . " They never put him on television . Hayden 's own version of the story was , laconically : " I got tied up and could n't get away . " At just about the same time in 1964 , advisers of the handsome young Illinois Republican Charles Percy may well have been regarding veteran Senator Paul Douglas and thinking that he would have a hard time running against a younger-looking person . In the fall of 1966 , Senator Douglas was challenged by Percy ? the very prototype of the candidate made for television ? and the older , much respected man was defeated . In 1968 , Carl Hayden announced he would not seek reelection , thus removing himself from any trial by age with Barry Goldwater . A few days after Barry Goldwater formally declared his candidacy for the Presidential nomination , on January 3 , 1964 , Democratic Senator Clair Engle of California announced that he was seeking reelection . At the time , Engle could scarcely walk , one arm was paralyzed and he was almost unable to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recovered . His condition was kept secret from the California voters . The declaration in January was made to them in a carefully edited film lasting only forty-two seconds . All that Californians saw on television was a middle-aged man saying with some // hesitancy : " The medical men have given me the green light and I am running . " In some doubt , the Democratic party leadership in California sent a group to Washington to find out Engle 's real condition . They were shocked when they saw him , and Governor Pat Brown finally demanded that Engle 's wife provide medical proof that her husband could run . Some doctors obliged by saying they felt " certain that the Senator will be fully able to take on the active phases of his election campaign . " The Democratic State Central Committee refused to accept the report , but only after another operation was Engle persuaded to withdraw from the primary . He died in July . It was too late to remove his name from the ballot and , although he was dead and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case raises the possibility that a politician physically or mentally unfit for office might be passed off as fit on television . It is conceivable that by propping a sick man up , making him up to look healthy , filming many takes and editing together a reasonablesounding phrase from here and there , the deception might work . It is difficult to exaggerate the power of a medium such as television to make appearance seem to be reality . From the earliest days of televised politics , it has been a rule of thumb among professional party workers , campaign managers and politicians themselves that the man who makes the best appearance on television stands a better chance of being a candidate in the first place and that the candidate who makes the better appearance has more chance of being elected . Obviously there are many other factors ? incumbency , ability to raise money , familiarity of a name ? but a face and personality that televise well are increasingly important qualifications . In 1955 , when television was still comparatively new to politics , the Republican National Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women : " We must choose able and personable candidates who can sell themselves ' because TV has changed the course of campaigns . " When the Democratic party bosses in New York State were looking for someone to turn Nelson Rockefeller out of the Gov138 THE PEOPLE MACHINE governor 's office in 1962 , they finally settled , under pressure from New York Mayor Robert Wagner , on United States Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau . An able but mild-mannered man , Morgenthau was not a popular choice and his nomination was railroaded through the state convention , full TV coverage notwithstanding . But one of the stages in making Morgenthau acceptable to the political bosses who would decide whether he should run was a quietly arranged television audition . The leaders watched him on the monitors and decided that his appearance was acceptable . According to Bob Price , campaign director for John V. Lindsay , the very telegenic Mayor of New York : " You do n't have to look as good as Lindsay , but if you look bad , it 's a minus . An ugly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years ago . " 7 It would be wrong to overemphasize the importance of a handsome face in the politics of the television age . Yet when that requirement is so firmly implanted in the thinking of the people who choose candidates , whether they are cigar-chewing pals in the back room , delegates to a convention or voters in a primary election , it can not be ignored . Television has encouraged the selection of candidates who conform to the values of a commercial entertainment medium . A physically pleasant appearance is one of those values , as Richard Nixon discovered . It is not enough to have regular features and to be free of deformities . Nixon 's features are regular and strong . In person , they give him , as Theodore White noticed , " a clean masculine quality . " On the television screen , however , with his features scanned electronically , converted briefly into a flow of electrical charges , and then reassembled by another scanner in the receiving set , Nixon 's appearance was transmogrified . In The Making of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells and the heavy brows cast shadow on the face and it glowered on the screen darkly ; when he became rhetorically indignant , the television showed ferocity ; . . . when he smiled and his fine white teeth showed , it was the smile made meaningless by the grin of all the commercial announcers who appear with similar white teeth showing . " 8 In 1966 , I accompanied Nixon for a week while he campaigned for Republican senatorial and congressional candidates in the // South . Toward the end of the tour , in Miami , there was a revealing experience . Nixon had an appointment to be interviewed at CBS station WTVJ-TV . In a control room overlooking the interview studio , there were several black-and-white monitor sets in addition to the colored monitors . The interviewer chatted with Nixon as lights were adjusted and the makeup checked . We could watch Nixon both in color and in black and white , and the difference was startling . When the technical director punched up the camera taking a close-up , there was the Nixon of 1960 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under any strain . On the color monitors , a few feet away , was another Nixon , much nearer the man in the flesh , whom we could also see through the control room window . Nixon in TV color was altogether a more personable individual . Technically speaking , color affords the camera a greater range of contrasts between light and dark than does black and white , particularly in shadowed areas of a picture . Nixon 's eyes were quite visible in color and his whole countenance had a more cheerful cast . It is intriguing to speculate that this man might have been kept out of the White House in 1960 by a tiny lag in technology . In the 1950 's , youth and confidence and skill before the camera made Nixon the political television star of the decade . In 1960 , he suffered by comparison with John Kennedy , who looked and sounded better than any of his contemporaries on TV . By 1968 , Nixon the TV performer had made a successful comeback . It 's how you say it Television has conditioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stars they treat as household names . They are not always the standards that political scientists would like politicians to adopt . Campaign director Joseph Napolitan says : " It 's not what you say , it 's how you say it . The general impression that is left is a lot more important than the individual words and phrases . For example , the Kennedy-Nixon debate . " 9 Others in the new breed of campaign directors agree . F. Clifton White , who masterminded Goldwater 's nomination , believes : // " When either party has options in the selection of a Presidential candidate , one of the major conditions they are going to make is the capability of that candidate to campaign through the TV medium . He has to be able to get the mush out of his mouth . " 10 Critic Gilbert Seldes , who wondered what expectancies the years of entertainment programming had created in the audience for the Kennedy-Nixon debates , came to these conclusions : " It has taught the audience to recognize certain moves and attitudes as being desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , put a premium on speed and this is reflected in the superinduced admiration for the quickness rather than the quality of wit and has somehow equated the process of contemplation ? the painstaking working out of a judgment , the careful consideration of what has been said before replying ? with slow-wittedness , with the stooge for the popular comedian 's brightness . " 11 The ideal candidate for television campaigning may not be a man with any original insights to offer his country , he may not be capable of grasping the immensities of the office he aspires to . What he must be is articulate and expressive in ways acceptable and effective on television . He needs to be able to stress the appearance of competence rather than the fact of it . He needs an ability to appear assured and confident , because that is the impression he will leave with viewers long after his words and picture have faded out . Napolitan thinks that Robert Kennedy had this ability . While Kennedy was still alive Napolitan said : " It does n't matter what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talking about . He can make a really impressive appearance even if he is saying nothing . There is nothing wrong with a candidate who says : I do n't know , I 'll find out . I 'd rather not comment right now , ' or We 're working on it . ' You have to look confident , " Napolitan says , " and act confident . That is what leaves the aura . " One professional political worker , Harry O'Donnell , a New York Democrat , says : " There is an aura around Kennedy that makes what he says seem more profound than it is. " 12 It was not Robert Kennedy whom the older style politicians worried about for this ability to project an image of assurance and The Televisible Candidate I 141 competence . Beside Ronald Reagan , Robert Kennedy looked like an amateur . A veteran New York politician , Frank O'Connor , believes that " With men like Reagan , there is a horrible danger that a person who is glib and articulate and an actor can create an impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 Politicians and journalists are still arguing about whether Ronald Reagan , the cowboy star of the Late Late Show , was the first nonentity television has elected to high political office . Such speculation would never have started if Reagan had emerged from the ranks of business , law or journalism to become Governor of the nation 's most populous state . He is a bright and personable man who might have done well in many professions if he had not become a movie actor . As an actor , however , he found that while America may heap riches and fame on movie stars , it does not rate their intellectual capacities high . Reagan has been mocked by almost every political commentator in the nation . To them , it was effrontery that an actor , a hired pitchman for a business corporation , should leap into a governorship and even aim his sights at the White House without having been elected to any lower political office . Reagan 's leap was , in fact , a classic demonstration of how many of the techniques of mass persuasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor who shot Abraham Lincoln Ronald Reagan entered the year 1966 with an image that needed doctoring if he was going to capture the California governorship . He had acquired a vehemently right-wing image from his conservative-oriented speeches before and during the 1964 Goldwater campaign . The first thing his public relations firm , SpencerRoberts , had to do to groom him for the Governor 's race was to soften that image . It was the nicest of ironies that the same firm , when retained by Nelson Rockefeller during the 1964 Republican primary in California , had done its best to label Reagan as an archconservative . Highly skilled in the techniques of getting information to the right quarters in the press , they had branded // Reagan , like Goldwater , an enemy of the progressive income tax , civil rights and the TVA , and , for good measure , a John Birch sympathizer . Two years later , with client Rockefeller back East and client Reagan at the door , Spencer-Roberts found it in their hearts ( for a campaign fee estimated at $150,000 ) to undo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responsible and moderate man . The machine now circulated 50,000 copies of Reagan 's as-toldto autobiography , Where 's the Rest of Me ? , named for a line Reagan spoke in a movie called Kings Row , in which he awoke in the hospital to find his legs amputated . California 's volatile politics nourished the growth of the newstyle campaign management firms long before other states . SpencerRoberts is one of the newest but most successful . Stuart Spencer and William Roberts were both volunteer officials in the Los Angeles County Young Republicans ( Spencer was a recreation director , Roberts a TV salesman ) when they joined forces to create a public relations firm in 1960 . The first campaign they managed they won , sending the conservative Republican John Rousselot to the U.S. Congress . When Rousselot became prominent in the John Birch Society , they dropped him . In 1962 , Spencer-Roberts assisted Senator Thomas Kuchel in being reelected and , in 1964 , picked up the Rockefeller account . Two years later , Bill Roberts , declaring that " the right-wing issue is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new client , Reagan , appear a moderate , to extract the maximum support from California Republicans . Reagan stopped uttering remarks like " there can be no moral justification of the progressive tax , " which had made him a favored political speaker for the General Electric Company . I le was encouraged instead to perfect a standard political speech that would be innocuously appropriate for all occasions . The New York Times described the typical Reagan speech as " a skillful script combining moral platitudes , pseudo indignation , homely examples and harmless jokes . " With a lifetime of memorization and professional delivery to draw on , Reagan became an extremely polished platform and television speaker , handsome and bronzed by the sun , with a particular knack of conveying sincerity . // The content was still basically conservative but bland . The strategy was campaigning by style and personality , not by programs or convictions . Columnist Joseph Alsop said during the campaign that Reagan resembled " a carefully designed , elaborately customerized , supermarket package , complete with the glossiest wrappings and the slickest sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but soap that had been made to a formula based on elaborate surveys to discover which perfumes would offend the fewest consumers . This approach showed a profound understanding of the political realities in California . The population of the state was growing and changing so fast that political allegiances had not had time to jell . Political writer Joseph Kraft reported that from one decade to the next , half the electorate were new voters . Many were strangers to politics , indifferent to past records and with feeble party identifications . It was a state that gave minimum political credit to old loyalties and the maximum advantage to the periodic " new face . " Political decisions thus turned on the ability to appeal to a constantly new electorate . Victory could depend on how many new voters candidates were able to lure to their party 's registers in an election year , and not on how successfully existing voters were wooed . The situation was ready-made for Reagan in 1966 . Pat Brown , the amiable Democratic Governor who had done much in eight years to stimulate California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He traveled the entire state and spent a great deal of money telling Californians that he had been a good Governor , as in fact he had , but the polls revealed indifference . Some people admitted they did not think very highly of Reagan but simply wanted a change . A nuclear engineer was quoted as saying : " I do n't think Reagan would be very good as Governor . But I 'm going to vote for him . I 'm tired of that Brown . " California Democrats , furthermore , were not united behind Brown . Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh , the second most powerful Democrat in California , stayed out of the race , fearing to be associated with what many saw as Brown 's predictable defeat . Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty , who won nearly a million votes when he opposed Brown in the Democratic primary , refused to endorse // him . And some New Leftists , accusing Brown of having moved to the right of his power base , talked nihilistically of voting for Reagan . By wearing only the vaguest conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simmering beneath California 's prosperity , overhigh taxes and high prices , government expenditure and welfare payments , iconoclastic youth at the State University and , particularly , Negro riots . The strategy that Spencer and Roberts mapped out for Reagan on the basis of their polls was therefore principally to be nice and to wait for nice things to happen to him . In addition to filing down his right-wing horns , they also had to make him credible as a candidate , to show that a movie actor who considered Bedtime for Bonzo one of his better films could be taken seriously in politics . Reagan 's movie roles and his years of television exposure as host on Death Valley Days had given him a clear identity . " The problem we had in the campaign , " Bill Roberts said later , " was to transfer this identification to a serious individual who was interested in government ? which he did very effectively . " 14 What is fascinatingly relevant to our examination is that television was the instrument in both processes : by showing his films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the films , made Reagan a household name and face , with a lightweight , actor 's image ; television then made him a political figure to be taken seriously . Judicious injections of substance by Spencer-Roberts gave a serious tone to the image of sincere concern that Reagan was cultivating . Many newsmen who reported on the campaign were impressed by the sheer professionalism of the blending . Listening to Reagan speak , it was extremely difficult to decide how much depth of knowledge and understanding there was beneath the surface of this handsome and apparently intelligent man . At press conferences , it was a different matter . Reagan seemed less sure of himself when detached from his script or led by questions beyond pat answers drawn from campaign rhetoric . During a press conference at Chico , California , on October 6 , Reagan gave contradictory views on open-housing laws . When reporters pointed out an inconsistency , he said he was The Televisible Candidate 145 tired and broke off the conference . After that , no more press conferences were scheduled . With familiar material in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While his old movies continued to run on the late shows , Californians could see him throughout the campaign , on fifteen-minute programs once each week , five minutes every day and on commercials . There were prolonged negotiations with the Brown camp over the form for a television debate . Insisting that he would not engage in " a declamation contest with an actor , " Brown wanted the NixonKennedy format with a panel of newsmen . Reagan wanted a straight debate . In the end , Brown allowed himself to be maneuvered into a compromise that probably did Reagan as much good as formal debating would have done . Brown agreed to appear in three quasi debates with Reagan in which they were questioned separately , one after the other , on scheduled television panel programs . The first encounter , on NBC 's Meet the Press , brought an exchange of charges of extremism . Reagan said Brown 's administration was controlled by " militant left-wing radicals . " Brown , in turn , said that Reagan 's " extremist " views had made him an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Johnson telephoned to congratulate Brown , but the effect had probably been to make Reagan seem more credible as a candidate . The next joint appearance occurred a few days after an outbreak of rioting in San Francisco . Brown had acted forcefully to put down the disturbance , but Reagan charged on television that the disorders indicated a " lack of leadership in Sacramento . " There was a third appearance the next day , on ABC 's Issues and Answers , and immediately the polls showed a sharp decline for Brown . Whether this was attributable to the riots themselves or to Reagan 's exploitation of them on television was not clear . At this point , Brown became worried . His campaign was handled by the firm of Baus and Ross , which had been managing political candidates since 1948 . Their strategy was to have Brown stand by his record and demolish Reagan 's candidacy with ridicule . The theme chosen was right-wing extremism . Brown 's television speeches and commercials played upon the most conservative // remarks Democratic researchers could find in Reagan 's early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security ? on the same day , " the Governor would say . " Extremists see their opportunity to put their blueprint on the largest state . . . the California we know would be starkly different if he should prevail . " They recalled that Reagan had once said , " When you 've seen one tree , you 've seen them all , " and used it to show that the Republican was cool about expensive conservation measures by the state . They hammered away at Reagan for not denouncing the John Birch Society . It did not work . There was a slight narrowing of Reagan 's lead in September but then Brown fell back in October . With Baus and Ross , Brown suddenly decided to alter the strategy . If Californians refused to believe that Reagan was the wicked agent of the far right , they might be made skeptical about an actor trying to be Governor . It was a desperation measure , far too late in the day to start building a new issue . Nevertheless , Baus and Ross drew up a crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not qualified to govern them . Charles Guggenheim , one of the nation 's foremost political film-makers , was flown out . He produced a series of television commercials whose pitch reflected the desperate situation . Well-known movie actors were filmed saying things like , " I 'm a cowboy and I play western roles but I could n't play the role of Governor . " One of the spots even said , " Remember , it was an actor who shot Abraham Lincoln . " Drawing on his success in the recent Pennsylvania primary with a brilliant film made for gubernatorial candidate Milton Shapp , The Man Against the Machine , Guggenheim made a similar halfhour film for Pat Brown called Man vs . Actor . Guggenheim said later that Brown might have done better ? that is , lost by less ? if these commercials had not been shown . " Brown was a loser and looked like one , " he said . The desperation commercials merely helped to drive home the message . The television blitz with Brown 's new theme began in the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots were scheduled and 400 one-minute television commercials , roughly // forty apiece each week on major TV stations . In addition to screening Man vs . Actor , Brown delivered a five-minute talk on television each evening and took part in an hour-long telethon . At the same time , Reagan 's managers switched from fifteen-minute shows to five-minute , one-minute and twenty-second commercials . A strategy from the very beginning to attack Reagan where he was most vulnerable ? his lack of experience ? might have made a difference . Adopted only at the end of the campaign , it did not . The miscalculation was widely criticized at the time by newspapers sympathetic to Brown . It seems doubtful in retrospect , however , that the " actor " issue would have been as convincing to the electorate as it seemed to Brown and to many liberal newspapermen . There were two forces working the other way ? the nature of politics in California , and the wider effect of television on political life generally . The weak organization of both parties at the grass roots level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in some other big states . Like the movies , television was largely a California industry . Politicians felt at home with it and the voters expected a heavy overlay of show business with their politics . Campaigning national politicians surrounded themselves with the biggest and most glamorous Hollywood names they could find . For many Californians , especially after George Murphy 's election to the Senate , it was not unusual or preposterous to see a well-known actor on television talking politics . It can be argued that for the whole nation , television has made the actor-politician inevitable . Television is indispensable to politicians , and the television audience is conditioned to like glamour and style . Therefore , politicians become glamorous and stylish . During the Reagan campaign , the New York Times analyzed this in an editorial : " With its neatly segmented half-hour programs , its well-crafted dramas with their simplified issues , clearly discernible heroes and villains , and fully resolved denouements , and its sincere , well-rehearsed announcers and masters of ceremonies , television has created a new reality , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of viewers . " 15 Brown 's decision to mount an all-out attack on Reagan as an // actor suggests that he and his advisers did not understand how deeply this influence had gone . The Governor complained at one point in the campaign : " I 'm not running against Ronald Reagan . I 'm running against Spencer-Roberts . That 's the candidate . " But he was also running against the influence of television . Kennedy versus Reagan A few months after Reagan began grappling with the real problems of governing California , the national television audience was given an intriguing foretaste of what the future may hold . Having had barely five months in which to familiarize himself with the complexities of state government , Reagan was drawn into an international forum to discuss the Vietnam war . He and Senator Robert Kennedy were persuaded by CBS Television to take part in a Town Meeting of the World . In a studio in London there gathered a group of foreign students angry about American policy . By means of a communications satellite , they hurled difficult and hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan in California . That evening it did not seem fanciful to regard what followed as the opening television debate of a future campaign for President . Reagan , whose bellicose generalities about the war had seemed irrelevant and laughable during his campaign for Governor , had prepared carefully for this appearance . It emerged later that he had asked for a detailed briefing on Vietnam and his staff had prepared a twelve-page memo . After Reagan studied it , they subjected hint to a long question-and-answer session the day before the program . That was the technique John F. Kennedy had used in preparing for the debates with Nixon in 1960 and later for his televised press conferences . No one was more familiar with the procedure than was Robert Kennedy , but his staff later said he made no special preparation for the appearance with Reagan . Admittedly , Kennedy had less need . As a close adviser to his brother he had confronted the problems of the war while in the Cabinet , and later as a Senator had wrestled with his conscience about how to exploit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . Even so , his familiarity with the subject did not come across that evening to the 15 million Americans watching Town Meeting of the World . Reagan fielded the questions with such a wealth of information and good humor that even liberals in the East thought he came off " better than Bobby . " Kennedy projected a diffident , hesitating manner . His ambiguities of expression left a sense of vagueness or uncertainty . He seemed to be trying to convince the students in London that he had no philosophical differences from them , that he was on their side . Reagan , while smiling pleasantly across the world at the questioners , was obviously talking straight to the American public . His syntax was pure and his speech fluent ; Kennedy 's was cluttered and confusing . If Reagan and Kennedy had been debating formally that evening , Reagan would have been called the winner . Behind Reagan 's TV manner is what Newsweek called " his unmatched ability to convince people that the honest face they see on their TV screens is an accurate reflection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " sometimes seems an eerie fulfillment of those prophecies of the early 1950 's that TV would revolutionize American politics , producing comfortably charismatic candidates cast very much in the Reagan mold . " If you like William Penn , you 'll love Milton Shapp Possibly the least charismatic candidate to run for any major office in recent years has been Milton Shapp , Democratic candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1966 . His startling campaign demonstrated the image-making possibilities of a thorough exploitation of television advertising . Shapp 's campaign manager was Joseph Napolitan , who has been described by Life as a " master strategist " and by the Washington Post as " one of the shrewdest professional political managers in the business . " Napolitan , an energetic man in his mid-thirties , is of Italian descent , stocky and voluble . He comes from Springfield , Massachusetts , and was a newspaperman until he and Lawrence O'Brien // ( for a time , President Johnson 's Postmaster General ) became partners in a public relations business . When O'Brien moved off to serve John Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a political pollster , aiding Kennedy in 1960 and Johnson in 1964 . He now heads his own political counseling and research firm and is a consultant to the Democratic National Committee . ( Upon Robert Kennedy 's declaration for the Presidency , O'Brien resigned from the Cabinet to aid him . ) Napolitan says : " If you had unlimited funds you could elect a nonentity to office . But this implies if you do n't do it this way , someone who is other than a nonentity will get elected . " " We had problems with Shapp , " he said . " People who were negative on him pictured him as an arrogant little Jew . The Republicans were trying to foster that image and we had to do something to counter it . " Milton Jerrold Shapp ( born Shapiro ) was the first Jew to run for statewide office in Pennsylvania . He was an aggressive , dryly humorous man who was able to transmute a $500 investment in TV aerials just after the war into the $12 million Jerrold electronics business twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-four , decided to try his golden touch at politics . He had been divorced and remarried . He had a physical appearance Napolitan thought " not impressive ? small , stoop-shouldered . " He was not a powerful speaker and he had no base of power . And he was almost totally unknown . A private poll in April , 1965 , revealed that only 3.3 percent of Pennsylvanians knew who Milton Shapp was . If these were not disadvantages enough , Shapp encountered active hostility from the state Democratic organization . And there was his religion . He was Jewish in a state with only 5 percent Jewish population . His one claim to fame was the assertion that he had been instrumental in persuading President Kennedy to adopt the idea of the Peace Corps . When the Republicans accused him of inventing this cozy niche in history , Shapp produced certification from Vice-President Humphrey . Late in the campaign , he even got Robert Kennedy to do a TV commercial recalling Shapp 's role . Napolitan says the rebuttal The Televisible Candidate 1 151 never received as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claim was a fabrication . Such misfortunes were in the future when Joe Napolitan and Shapp settled down late in 1965 to calculate how they could shove this unknown businessman past the defenses of the Pennsylvania Democrats and into the nomination for Governor . The primary election which he had to contest was on May 17 . Napolitan gambled and kept his mass media campaign under wraps until only fifteen days before the election . When it was released , it covered Pennsylvania in the thickest blizzard of publicity ever recorded in a political campaign . In the months preceding the primary , while Shapp campaigned routinely , Napolitan and the image-makers were preparing . They researched issues and voter responses with such fine detail that they even ascertained which billboard colors were most likely for psychological reasons to catch the eye . They decided on orange and red . They invented slogans worthy of a canned soup campaign ; the most famous was " If you like William Penn , you 'll love Milton Shapp . " Most important , they hired Charles Guggenheim , the best film-maker Napolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guggenheim employed a technique he had attempted with Robert Kennedy in New York in 1964 ? following Shapp on the campaign trail . The thirty-minute " documentary , " called The Man Against the Machine , was regarded by Napolitan and others as the best half-hour political film ever produced . " I do n't believe in putting on poor TV , " Napolitan says . " The competition on TV for a viewer 's time is so heavy that people who are not competitive are losing out . The only way to compete is to put on quality material . " He thinks two other things are essential . One is not to try to tell the film-maker how to do his job : " It would be better if more campaign managers and candidates would get out of the way and not tell the film-maker what to do . Just let him do it . " The other essential is to be willing to spend money in making and promoting your film . " If you do a half-hour film you should promote it heavily . We spent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " Napolitan said . He thinks most politicians are not willing to spend enough money on production . " People must go to experts , " he says . " If they have $100,000 most people want to spend only $5,000 on production . But it is better to spend $50,000 on production . " His emphasis on the half-hour campaign film contradicts the trend since the 1950 's to shorter political programs . Napolitan also uses one-minute and thirty-second commercials in great quantity , but he avoids the five-minute piece because he says the structure of television schedules does not permit politicians to buy good time slots . What is different in his half-hour films is that he uses them as other campaign directors use one-minute spots . Once it is made , the film is shown and reshown as often as the time segments can be bought . On May 2 , Napolitan unleashed the carefully prepared media campaign to force the name and image of Milton Shapp into the consciousness of millions of Pennsylvanian Democrats who had never heard of him and to persuade them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced campaign manager of the old school , the very effort would sound ridiculous . Only newspaper ads were run the first day of the blitz media campaign . The next day came radio spots . Television commercials began running on May 6 , and on the ninth , with only eight days of the primary campaign left , the half-hour film was introduced . It was run thirty-five times in those eight days , including ten showings on the night before the primary . Thirty-five showings of a halfhour film ? seventeen and a half hours ? in just over a week is a staggering amount of television time by conventional standards . The primary cost Shapp $1.5 million of his personal fortune ? but he knocked out the machine-backed Democratic candidate by 50,000 votes . The party regulars , who had regarded Shapp as a joke or an " egotistical buffoon , " as Time put it , caved in . The state 's former Governor and Democratic king-maker , David Lawrence , told a party dinner : " Crow should have been the main dish . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking regular soundings with name-identifiThe // cation polls . In January of the election year , Shapp 's name was familiar to 5.2 percent of Pennsylvanians . In July , a few weeks after the primary blitz , the figure had leaped to 65.5 percent . The whirlwind of advertisements and spots and the saturation showing of The Man Against the Machine had made Shapp even better known than the man he now had to face in the general election , Raymond P. Shafer . Shafer had served two terms as a State Senator and been William Scranton 's Lieutenant Governor for four years , but was known , the polls said , by only 59.1 percent of the voters . The Scranton administration had been popular enough and Shafer , as the chosen heir , had counted on an easy campaign until Shapp won the Democratic primary . Although Shafer 's campaign manager , Robert Kunzig , was soon charging that the Democrats were marketing Shapp " like corn flakes , " the Republicans quickly adopted the same methods . " By using TV effectively in the primary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and to spend money on it . " Shafer had obvious assets as a candidate , in addition to the legacy and backing of Scranton . He was six feet two inches tall , athletic and sandy-haired , a Protestant minister 's son whose very conventional family life was stressed in the campaign . According to Napolitan 's analysis , other Shafer attributes that mattered were an ability to memorize speeches and read them well , possession of the full support of his party , coverage by a friendly Republican press , and previous campaign experience which enabled him to answer questions without getting into trouble . He avoided mistakes and , like Shapp , was amply financed . Ten days after Shapp 's primary victory , the candidates began the now ritual dance of the TV debates . Shafer challenged Shapp to debate . Shapp immediately accepted ( the right behavior for an underdog ) . Seven weeks went by and they heard nothing further from Shafer . Then Shapp reopened the discussion . Napolitan , with the various Kennedys ' experiences in mind , demanded a panel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , on October 14 , with newsmen as questioners , but it was not shown on a statewide hookup . Napolitan thought Shafer did better // in the memorized opening and closing statements , while Shapp handled the questions better . The encounter was regarded as a standoff . Having closely observed Shapp 's techniques in the primary , the Republicans picked up the best film-maker they could find , David Wolper , who had produced highly regarded television specials , including The Making of the President . With Wolper , the Republicans prepared four different half-hour programs , three of which were put on film . Since Shafer was campaigning largely on the Scranton record and did not offer any radically new programs , he concentrated on denigrating Shapp , whom he accused of " arrogance and lack of insight " and of espousing programs that would send Pennsylvania " crashing downward to a state of chaos and tax her to the wall . " Shapp had original and unconventional solutions for everything . The one which brought most ridicule from Shafer was a proposal to offer free tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond issue . " Shifty , dangerous , desperate , cunningcrafty , grandiose , obsessed , crack-brained , " were some of the adjectives Shafer applied to Shapp , while the Democrat attempted to pin the Goldwater label on Shafer . Napolitan and Shapp ridiculed the Republicans with the funniest and most expensive campaign joke of that year . Shafer had been campaigning on the slogan " Something wonderful is happening in Pennsylvania . " One evening , hundreds of Republicans attending a Shafer dinner found a glossy , twenty-six-page pamphlet with the same title at each of their dinner places . They assumed it was a piece of Shafer campaign literature . When they opened " Something Wonderful Is Happening in Pennsylvania , " they found page after page of frightening photographs of slums and dumps , unemployed miners , shoeless children and polluted streams . On the last page was the grinning face of Milton Shapp . This time , the polls were not responding to Napolitan 's treatment . Although Shapp continued to emerge as better-known than Shafer ( 70.9 ? 66.8 percent in September and 78.2 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked . In mid-September , one pollster , E. John Bucci , hired by the Republicans , found Shafer leading // Shapp by 53 ? 47 percent , while Public Opinion Surveys , Inc. , the firm that conducted the name-identification polls , reported Shafer leading by 47 ? 34 percent , with 19 percent undecided . Analyzing the polls , Napolitan decided that Shapp was slipping because the Republicans and his own actions were spreading an image of arrogance . Shapp had publicly boasted , for example , " I know more about Pennsylvania than any other one man in the state . " The media campaign , particularly on television , was therefore redirected to improve Shapp 's image , especially to give him some charm . Parts of some commercials , Napolitan recalls , were shot as many as twenty times to extract just the right expression and feeling from the candidate . The change had a curious effect and exemplified the kind of image manipulation that those who are anxious about the implications of the new campaign techniques like to point to . One man who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the campaign was FCC Commissioner Robert E. Lee . Lee knew Shapp as a smart , cold businessman who was honest and conscientious . " Milton Shapp would have made a good Governor , " Lee said , " but some of the things they put together for him were projecting a personality and charm he did n't have . " 16 Lee feared that the same techniques might be used to elect just anybody . To the contrary , there may have been something of a backlash reaction to the charm commercials . Napolitan says that in trying to " soften his image " through the television campaign , " something of a credibility gap was produced . " Another half-hour film about Shapp was made for the general election . Possessing a dreamy , poetic quality , it showed Shapp walking in the rain , visiting poor people , eating breakfast at home , strolling affectionately with his daughter , talking to students . Whenever possible , Guggenheim designed his shots so as to have Shapp framed in soft , leafy trees , or moving against the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interspersed with soft guitar music . Viewed outside the context of the election campaign , the film is a small masterpiece of persuasion , with a strong emotional quality that is hard to resist even when the viewer knows he is looking at a propaganda film . There // was not a suspicion in the entire thirty minutes that Shapp was arrogant or aggressive or brittle in personality . He came across as a gentle , easily moved intellectual . The film was held back until eight days before the polling and then was shown some seventy times in that period . In addition , the film from the primary campaign , cut down to half its length , was broadcast thirty times . Both sides had trouble buying all the television time they wanted . The Republicans sent out orders to their agents to buy every available twenty- and sixty-second prime-time spot in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh for the final four days of the campaign . All they could get were three twenty-second spots in Pittsburgh ; none were available on the main stations in Philadelphia . Each side spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and production . On the night before the election , Shafer forces mounted a new style of television program which Napolitan thought very effective . It opened in a TV studio , where paid professional actors pretending to be newsmen brought in election-eve reports from different parts of the state . Announcers in the various stations contacted made the reports . Napolitan later said he was surprised that the stations had permitted their employees to take part . Shapp lost the election by a substantial margin . Nevertheless , Napolitan claimed that his candidate was the only Democrat running for major office in 1966 who improved on his party 's performance compared with the previous off-year election . Napolitan believes that " it is impossible to change a candidate , although it is possible to change his image somewhat . " He admits trying to change Shapp 's image but he disputes the Republican charge that they were trying to sell Shapp like a product . " Shapp is the very antithesis of the know-nothing candidate who is maneuvered into office by shrewd unscrupulous handlers , " Napolitan says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offered positive programs . " Nevertheless , Napolitan prided his campaign organization on its ability to select and develop the issues Shapp presented according to the findings in the polls . He said during the campaign that if a // view the candidate was supporting was shown to be unpopular , it was " deemphasized . " What was found to be positive was stressed . That is how campaigns for soap and other consumer products are conducted , on the basis of market research . When Napolitan says Shapp was not sold like soap , he means Shapp was not a nonentity , which is true . But good soap and bad soap are both sold the same way , and Napolitan 's handling of the Pennsylvania campaign was full of lessons for managers with candidates to sell , whether brilliant or empty-headed , if they have the money . Emily Post , or the casual voter It is an article of faith held by many in politics that television inevitably unmasks the phony . Frank O'Connor , Democratic City Council President in New York , says , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV long enough , no matter how phony he is , sooner or later they 're going to catch up with him . " 17 While it is true that television quickly punctures rhetoric and makes a broad platform manner look ridiculous , recent developments in television campaigning make it necessary to reexamine the idea that the television camera searches out falseness . Defending the influence of television on politics , CBS President Frank Stanton wrote in 1964 : " There is no such thing as a ' telegenic ' personality . It can only give a personality that exists a wider audience . . . . Far from creating synthetic personalities , television can only unmask them . " 18 On the contrary , I believe that television can , in a real sense , " create " a personality by filtering out some facets of a man 's own personality and letting through certain others , as happened to Nixon in 1960 . The television audience is conditioned to expect certain traits as attractive by its prolonged exposure to the staroriented entertainment system . Charles A. Siepmann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education , believes that television puts a high premium on facets of a politician 's personality " that are impertinent to the choice of party precisely as they divert our // interest from the matter of his discourse to the man . Note , also , that the diversion of our interest is not merely to personality but to the distinctive and adventitious attributes of TV personality . " 19 Obviously television can do more than merely enlarge the audience . It can inhibit an otherwise confident man ? Lyndon Johnson for example . It can exaggerate traits , put a premium on appearance , favor the man who is glib and seemingly sincere ? again a result of audience-conditioning by a generation of formula entertainment which stresses the slick rejoinder , the ready phrase , professional assurance , the right word on the lips . Can television " only unmask " synthetic personalities ? President Johnson , for example , often exhibits on television something as close as one could come to a " synthetic personality . " It is not his own , as people who talk with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some people oppressed by his speech style and unctuous manner . He may thus offend people but is he " unmasked " ? Is Reagan unmasked when he uses his benign , avuncular manner to sell his political ideas ? The truth is that a skillful performer can more or less choose which personality he will exhibit on television . The more it draws on his own , real personality , the easier the exercise will be . Only the unskillful subject is the victim of his own unattractive manner . Some performers " make it " on television because their own personality , as transmuted through TV , is what the mass of the people want at a certain time . Others present a more studied persona , constructed by them and calculated to appeal . There is no reason why politicians of special ability in this field can not build images as well as actors do . This assumes that a politician , like an actor , is deliberately playing a part on television . Ronald Reagan is said to believe that it is very difficult to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to his " communications director , " Lyn Nofziger , Reagan says : " One thing that the television camera can pick up quicker than anything is insincerity , phoniness. " 20 In the type of modern campaign we are discussing , however , it is not left to the candidate to survive alone on television . He is not // required to expose his naked personality . Each of his appearances is a strictly controlled event . In the case of commercials , it will be a rehearsed and calculated image of the candidate . Joseph Napolitan cites a case in which effective control produced an instant image of a candidate which voters did not recognize after the election . The candidate was Endicott Peabody , gubernatorial candidate in Massachusetts in 1962 . " Peabody was a big , handsome guy , " Napolitan says . " Immediately after the election he started holding press conferences and people said he seemed entirely different than in the campaign . The trouble was he was getting tough questions and giving bumbling answers . Not the clean , crisp image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because maybe you waited eighteen times in filming the spots to get just the right thing . His TV image dropped afterward like a lead balloon . They had elected him on one basis and he seemed entirely different . " Peabody , who scraped into office by 5,000 votes on the coattails of Edward Kennedy , was defeated in the Democratic primary two years later . Questions of image were probably reinforced by the annoyance Peabody caused many old-line Democratic workers and appointees by proposing government reforms which would have blocked traditional channels of patronage . Clif White says : " I still believe that the gol'darned camera shows the man 's real personality . You ca n't dress him up and make him up and still not have his real personality show through . You can get away with a couple of shows and hide a man 's basic personality but not continuously . " 21 Yet is it a question of hiding a man 's basic personality ? It is a question of finding men as candidates who have agreeable personalities on which the image-makers can build . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with the tremendous advantage of being a household name for ability and integrity in service to his country , what made him a successful political commodity year after year was his personality . The political superstructure was erected on top of that , and during his last years in the White House , commentators ( while not questioning Eisen160 I THE PEOPLE MACHINE hower 's integrity ) found almost as many unpleasant things to say about his executive ability as they have said about Reagan 's . If they can possibly avoid it , party officials do not choose a candidate with an obviously nasty personality that needs to be hidden by TV makeup and careful staging . The question that arises as television becomes indispensable to political campaigners is how much agreeable personality is coming to outweigh other assets . It is dangerous to attribute to the inanimate television camera a human or even a supernatural ability to read and reveal character . The circumstance of being on television , as all of us know who have worked before the camera for a long time , can put even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is perhaps the most skilled of all television commentators at keeping cool under the extraordinary pressures of the trade , has to contain and suppress a great amount of nervous tension . Ability to cope with stress may be an indication of strength of character , but inability to suppress it completely on camera is not a sign of character weakness . Eric Sevareid of CBS gives evidence every night of a nervous reaction to the medium ; but that does not make his observations less astute . As Charles Thomson has written in the Brookings Institution study of Television and Presidential Politics : " Possibly a more reasonable approach would be to state that television can unmask a charlatan , if those responsible for the use of camera and microphone want to do so . But given control over the television situation ? makeup , lighting , camera angles , speechwriting , teleprompting and the like ? there is no reason in the world that the basic appearance of a candidate can not be acceptable . It may not be a crashing success , but there are specialists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man past either Emily Post or the casual voter . " 22 In Kennedy Campaigning , Murray B. Levin worries about the possibility " that men skilled in the arts of communication and persuasion can successfully merchandise a vacuous or hollow shell , or a dim-witted fool , or , what is really more to the point , a very average fellow , by creating for him a public image that bears little or no resemblance to his private reality , but is so astutely constructed and sold , that it is accepted as the real thing . " 23 // Make him a star by calling him a star Does television spontaneously create candidates ? Whenever that question is raised , the late Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee is the first example offered . Kefauver was just another United States Senator to the public until the Senate appointed a special committee in 1951 to investigate crime in interstate commerce . Kefauver was made chairman and through extensive television coverage of the hearings became a national figure almost overnight . He was raised , as Bernard Rubin put it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinnacle of national popularity and international interest . " 24 This impetus pushed Kefauver to make an immediate frontal assault on the Presidency in 1952 and he won enough primaries to come close to the Democratic nomination . Obviously , not every chairman of a Senate committee is catapulted into the Presidential arena by televised hearings . Senator Joseph McCarthy was badly hurt by the most explosive hearing ever televised . Extensive television coverage of Washington and of prominent politicians around the country is doubtless a major factor in giving likely candidates public recognition much faster than they could attain it elsewhere . It is perhaps tempting to rely too much on this power , as William Scranton may have done in thinking he had any chance at all of wresting the Republican Presidential nomination from Barry Goldwater . Television can not , as Rubin points out , give people " instant memories of a man . " It may be that the use of free television is most significant when it is timed to coincide with another sequence of events . In the early spring of 1962 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known he wanted to be a Senator , there was vigorous opposition in the Democratic Party both in Massachusetts and nationally . The youngest Kennedy seemed too green ; he was scarcely past the minimum age for a U.S. Senator ( thirty years ) and with President Kennedy 's relations with Congress touchy enough anyway , it looked too much like nepotism . The President himself did not want Teddy to run but changed his mind when the // advance polls showed that he would win easily . On March 11 , 1962 , Edward Kennedy appeared on NBC 's Meet the Press , a launching platform for many campaigns , and said he wanted to be the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts . Four days later , he went to Massachusetts and formally announced his candidacy . It may be that his appearance on Meet the Press helped to give his desire to run some legitimacy and to provide him with the appearance of being a candidate . To the simple mind it might appear that a man who is important enough to appear on Meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate . From that time , as Professor Levin has recorded , Kennedy 's imagemakers took over : " The political campaign makes him a star by calling him a star ? on radio , on television , in documentary films , in billboards , in press releases , in ghost-written speeches , in brochures , in handouts , in one-sheets. " 25 It is probably true that television has merely speeded up a process that was long established . Well before television 's advent , there were recognized occasions when likely prospects were given a moment of glory ? like seconding a nomination at a national convention ? to push them forward . The press always seized upon these and quieter opportunities , such as an unusually provocative speech on the Senate floor or able questioning of a witness in hearings , or the battles of a certain governor with a hostile legislature . Columnists in search of something fresh would pull names out of obscurity and politicians with influence would float trial balloons . All this still happens now , but it happens much faster . These , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political candidates : personality above all else ? a personality not too specific and not the least abrasive , a personality which is pleasantly neutral enough to be built upon ; a pleasing appearance with no features which may light unflatteringly on television ; i assurance ? a way of comporting yourself that suggests , with modesty , that you know more about anything than anyone else and could handle any crisis ; articulateness ? an ability to put anything you say , even if it is " I do n't know what we 're talking about , " in such a commanding and authoritative way that your grasp and leadership qualities will flow through into every living room . In other words , you should be an actor . Debates One evening at the end of the 1960 campaign , after watching a replay of one of his television debates with Richard Nixon , John F. Kennedy remarked to Pierre Salinger : " We would n't have had a prayer without that gadget. " 1 For a short period after 1960 , the televised debate was a feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaust itself after the midterm elections of 1962 . What was hailed as " an event of monumental significance in the history of our Constitution " at the Presidential level became merely another campaign device to be embraced or ignored as tactics demanded . Now politicians have accepted the popular view that the television debate is something freshly honorable , signifying decency and clean campaigning . Avoiding a debate is therefore a matter to be handled with careful attention to public relations and as a crucial part of campaign strategy . When , in 1964 , Robert Kennedy was trying to unseat Kenneth Keating , the Republican Senator from New York , Kennedy 's advisers did not want him to risk a debate with the older , much respected Senator . One aide , Gerald Gardner , has said that " the Kennedy forces were not hungering for debate if it could be honorably avoided . " 2 It could not be " honorably avoided , " but Kennedy and Keating each staged an elaborate charade , trying to make the other appear the reluctant debater . Such games have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at a disadvantage . The experienced man fears to allow his untested opponent seem his equal . The incum-163 // bent does not wish to lend an opponent the prestige of his office by sharing a platform with him . The famous politician may be anxious not to help the other man become better known . The young challenger may worry about looking callow beside a distinguished officeholder ; the older man may in turn fear he will be thought decrepit beside the younger . An incumbent may be trying to keep some issues dormant as he seeks reelection . Any candidate may be uncertain about how his television personality will contrast with his opponent 's when they are together . One of the startling discoveries of 1960 was that since the founding of the Republic , no Presidential candidates had ever been joined in a campaign debate . Americans who had something like a folk memory of Lincoln and Douglas breathing health into nineteenth-century democracy had to be reminded that it was in a contest for the U.S. Senate that they debated in 1858 . Another fact was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election time . Loyal Republicans would pull on their galoshes to wade though the Vermont snow to hear Republicans , but would n't flip the radio dial to hear a Democrat . Democrats were deaf to talk from the other side . Many newspapers contributed to this one-sided approach . Many thoughtful people found serious weaknesses in the 1960 debates , but no one denied that the encounters encouraged Americans to listen to the other side . Sam Lubell , an acute student of public opinion , noted a further benefit . The debates made " both the candidates and the election result more acceptable to the electorate . " The Democrats saw that if Richard Nixon won , it would not be a catastrophe ; Republicans could not help noticing that John F. Kennedy was an intelligent , reasonable human being . Many other claims were made for the debates , especially by the television industry , which felt it had acquired , by association , much prestige . Most of these claims ? that the debates greatly heightened voter interest , increased the turnout and clarified the issues ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that adapting the tradition of political debate to the mass medium did encourage voters to emerge a little from their partisan shells . Debates 165 There had been various experiments with broadcast political debates before 1960 . Dewey and Stassen met on radio in the 1948 Oregon primary . Two Democrats , Kefauver and Stevenson , appeared together on national television with a moderator in May , 1956 , and commentators praised the quiet seriousness of their conversation . Robert F. Wagner and Jacob Javits , who were contesting a U.S. Senate seat , debated in New York . John Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey took part in a televised debate during the West Virginia primary in May , 1960 , and the program was picked up by a number of other stations around the country . Nevertheless , it was the fact that Richard Nixon suddenly changed his mind in the summer of 1960 and ignored the advice he had been given that made the broadcast debate an important part of modern political history . The Great Debates Nixon never explained at the time what prompted the decision . Carroll Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for the campaign , says that the Vice-President told his staff during a planning session : " Absolutely , I will never just stand up in front of a camera and talk and I will never debate or discuss debates . " 3 That was the understanding of his top strategists as Nixon went into the Republican Convention in Chicago . The day after Nixon 's nomination , on July 27 , Robert W. Sarnoff of NBC sent telegrams to Nixon and Kennedy proposing a series of debates . Kennedy discussed the matter at a luncheon meeting with his campaign staff in Hyannisport and then quickly accepted . His advisers said they felt it was important to be first and thus appear to " challenge " Nixon , who they felt would procrastinate . Nixon did not immediately respond in person . A statement accepting the proposal in principle was issued to the press by his press secretary , Herb Klein . The other members of his campaign staff , including Republican National Chairman Len Hall , learned of Nixon 's acceptance through newspaper reports . Four days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a telegram stipulating a " full and free // exchange of views without prepared text or notes and without interruption . " Carroll Newton believes that Herb Klein talked Nixon into accepting . Among those who had urged Nixon not to debate Kennedy was President Eisenhower , who says in his memoirs that his objection was practical : " Nixon was widely known ; Kennedy was not : dramatic debates would therefore help Kennedy . " In his own book , Six Crises , published two years after the debates , Nixon said he had been doubtful about the wisdom of building up an audience for Kennedy , but could not refuse for fear that Kennedy would say he was afraid to stand on the Eisenhower record . On August 24 , in a postconvention session , the House of Representatives approved Senate Joint Resolution 207 , suspending the Equal Time provisions for the Presidential election , and networks began planning the debates with representatives of the candidates . The complicated negotiations , described in The Great Debates , edited by Sidney Kraus , quickly revealed that the candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks wanted the traditional format , the so-called Oregon Debate , in which the candidates would make opening statements and then question each other directly . Both candidates rejected this in favor of a panel of journalists to question them . Their representatives said that a straight debate would not hold an audience and that campaign issues were not sufficiently clear-cut to stimulate good debate . The latter observation was an extraordinary piece of behind-the-scenes candor . Kennedy 's plenipotentiaries went further , saying they were not as interested in the format as they were in getting him on the same television program with the Vice-President . On the other hand , Herbert A. Seitz and Richard D. Yoakam reported , " They realized Kennedy 's skill with the question and answer setup and were really happier with it than a straight debate format . " 4 Douglass Cater , who covered the debates for The Reporter , said that Nixon 's people feared they would be too polite if they interrogated the other side . A Kennedy aide said , " since nobody likes the prosecuting attorney type on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others . " 5 Debates 1 167 At Senate hearings the following year , Republican Senator Hugh Scott , of Pennsylvania , made a point of insisting that he had good information that the networks had imposed the panel format . Frank Stanton , the CBS President , denied it at the time and the evidence in the Kraus studies published by the University of Indiana would appear to support him . It is interesting that the politicians were so aware , before the , debates , of how important considerations of image might be . A political candidate concerned about not appearing to be the nasty ' , prosecutor shows an awareness of the difference of television as a/ campaign medium and a willingness to let that difference influence behavior . A politician willing to modify the traditional structure of a formal debate because he fears he may be branded with too ; aggressive an image is a politician concerned not primarily with , the weight of his arguments but with projecting a favorable image . ) Later , it was widely agreed that the first debate , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the available evidence , Kennedy seems . to have been more aware beforehand than Nixon was that the , general impression he made on the viewers could carry more weight than what he said . I had an unusual perspective on the first of the 1960 debates . NBC had sent me to Berlin to film some advance material on the attitude of West Berliners to the American election . One evening in October , the United States Information Service arranged a screening of the first Nixon-Kennedy debate in the ballroom of the Berlin Hilton . The room was filled not only with Americans but with intensely curious Berliners . At that time , feeling was strongly pro-Republican among the West Germans . They knew Nixon 's reputation for tough anti-Communism and were confident that with him in the White House there would be no softening of the Western position in Berlin . Kennedy was an unknown quantity , reputed to be a liberal , and that worried the Germans . When the lights went on after the debate film had run , most of the Berliners were very glum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a poorer showing than Kennedy . What perhaps emerges most persistently from all the studies of the debates ( and few political occasions have been so minutely scrutinized ) is that the appearance and behavior of the candidates , the // way in which their personalities were transmitted , overshadowed what they said . Those factors , and the argument over Nixon 's tactical wisdom in agreeing to debate , appear to carry the most important lessons for politicians and the public about the true significance of televised debates . The conclusion is reinforced by a study of other TV debates in later campaigns . All the contributors to the Kraus study stressed the importance of image and the relative unimportance of content : Douglass Cater said that the Kennedy-Nixon dialogue " was largely a paste-up job , containing bits and snippets from campaign rhetoric already used many times . As the series wore on , the protagonists were like two weary wrestlers who kept trying to get the same holds . What became clear was how limited the vocabulary of the debates really was and how vague were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Samuel Lubell was concerned that the debates put pressure on the candidates " to project some contrived image ' across the screen into the national living room . " 7 Kurt and Gladys Lang , who did a study of voter reactions in New York City , found that voting intentions changed much less than did the candidates ' images for the voters . Kennedy changed from " an eager , affable , young and ambitious political aspirant into one that epitomized the competent , dynamic and quickthinking candidate " ; Nixon , who had been seen as an experienced politician with reputed great skill in debate , emerged as a disappointing , nervous , complicated personality.8 Theodore White believed that the greatest opportunity ever for a discussion to clarify the issues in a Presidential campaign was missed . He attributed this to the tyranny of timing in broadcasting , " which can not bear to suffer a pause of more than five seconds . " Nixon and Kennedy were thus reduced " to snapping their two-anda-half-minute answers back and forth " and could not stop to think . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates . They revealed that more people thought that Kennedy won the first debate , that the second was very close , that Nixon won the third , with the fourth also close . A study by the Mass Communications Research Center of the // University of Wisconsin concluded that " Kennedy did not necessarily win the debates , but Nixon lost them . " 10 Certainly the first debate , for whatever reasons , gave the Kennedy campaign a substantial boost . Ten southern Governors who had not been overly enthusiastic about his candidacy immediately sent Kennedy a telegram of warm congratulations . A worker in the Kennedy-Johnson campaign headquarters in New York said that before the first debate there had been trouble finding enough mature volunteers ; afterward , there were more than enough applications . Through August and September , Kennedy had been running slightly behind Nixon in the Gallup Poll , with one exception on September 14 , when he was ahead ( 48 ? 47 percent ) . In the poll published on October 12 , after the first two debates , Kennedy had a substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap narrowed toward election day , Nixon never regained the lead . There has been no attempt , however , by students of the debates to suggest that Kennedy " won " because of any demonstrable forensic superiority . Some people who only heard the debates on radio thought that the two candidates had scored about evenly . Even among his close associates , the focus was on the way Kennedy had closed the maturity gap by appearing , in Pierre Salinger 's words , " a mature , knowledged attractive man . " There was an outcry by disappointed Republicans the day after the first debate . The Chicago Daily News headlined its story " Was Nixon Sabotaged by TV Makeup Artists ? " but modified the account when the Nixon camp revealed that it was their own man , not a CBS saboteur , who had applied the makeup . The lighting was blamed , until it was discovered that the candidates ' advisers had been fully consulted . In fact , they had at the last minute asked that technicians put more light into Nixon 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong shade , that Nixon had been badly advised and wore a suit which did not contrast sufficiently with the background . They accused CBS of selecting cutaway , or reaction , shots of Nixon that caught him unawares , wiping the perspiration from his face and nervously tapping his foot . The other two networks went even further than CBS in the // subsequent three debates to protect themselves from such criticism , redesigning the sets and lighting to be more flattering to both debaters . By the second debate , Nixon 's health was restored and there was marked improvement in his appearance . Besides the opinions of voters about the content of the debates and which candidate they considered had won , some studies tried to determine what effect the debates had had , if any , on the actual voting . None of them found any positive evidence that the debates alone had either caused an important switch in voting intention or significantly increased the voter turnout . Lubell 's interviews across the country made him think that " religious prejudice was much more powerful in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that viewers of the debates , if anything , changed less in the strength of the commitment to their party than nonviewers , who only heard or read about the debates . Charles A. Siepmann concluded : " It is by no means certain that , as some people assert , the debates contributed to the making of more intelligent decisions by the voters . Nor has it been established that the debates were responsible for the record turnout of voters at the polls " 1 ' We are left with the paradox that most commentators think the debates harmed Nixon , but with no objective evidence that they swung the election to Kennedy . Perhaps , if the result had not been so close , the effects might have shown up more conclusively in the surveys . It is remarkable that more adult Americans watched the first debate ? the average estimate is 70 million ? than actually voted . Nixon and Kennedy received a total of 68 million votes and the difference between them was only 112,702 . It seems inconceivable that a political event with so many participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy and Nixon thought that the debates had decided the election . Another area worthy of more research is what effect reports by other media and word of mouth about the debates had on people 's attitudes . Some voters heard the first debate on the radio and thought it a draw , but within hours they were hearing from many commentators that it was a clear-cut victory for Kennedy . The Opinion Research Corporation study already mentioned suggests // that such secondhand accounts may have had more influence on voters ' decisions than firsthand viewing . There is yet another feature of such encounters , which was remarked on in 1960 : the advantage to the loser of being exposed to viewers of the winner 's party . It was argued by Frank Stanton of CBS that Nixon as well as Kennedy had something to gain by the nature of the audience . Those who watched the 1960 debates were found to be roughly one-half Democrats , one-third Republicans and the rest independent . Since Nixon , the better-known candidate , came from a party with roughly one-third fewer members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the independents for support to win , he stood to gain from the exposure . As Stanton further points out , the sheer size of the audience ( CBS put the total viewers at 120 million for the four debates ) was of help to both candidates equally , as was its willingness to stay with the programs and not tune out . The typical television family was said to have kept its set tuned to the debates for fifty-four minutes of the hour . Nine of ten television families tuned into some part of the debates ; more than half watched at least three and one out of four watched them all . The four debates attracted television audiences that were on average 20 percent larger than the entertainment programs they replaced . By any standards the Great Debates of 1960 were a remarkable experiment . In further attempts at the Presidential level , it needs to be decided whether the weaknesses they exhibited sprang from the nature of the television medium or could be avoided by modifying the format . The chief criticism of the Nixon-Kennedy encounters was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . Undeniably , that arose partly from the psychological difference between the impact of television and radio , on the one hand , and newspapers , on the other . The novelty of the occasion and the fact that there were only four encounters may have also contributed to this effect by not giving the viewers time to adjust to the personalities . If such debates between candidates became a tradition of Presidential campaigns , it is arguable that voters might gradually pay more attention to what is being said . Similarly , if there were more debates during a campaign , one a // week for example , or if they lasted two hours instead of one , fascination with personality might wear off to a degree . The interposition of a panel of questioners was also much criticized in 1960 . If they had been made to use the traditional form of debate and argue to one specified point , speaking directly to one another , there would have been less chance of their sliding off into superficialities . If televised debates were to become a tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a rule of thumb , however , incumbents are probably going to avoid debates whenever they can . Besides , no one ? political scientists , journalists or television executives ? can really tell any candidate how he should campaign . That is his and his campaign manager 's prerogative . Still , a line of evolution which would result in greater use of TV debates in Presidential elections can be visualized . There may be in the future so much concern about the encroachment of commercials into campaigns that steps will be taken to limit their use . Then politicians and broadcasters will be faced with the need to produce some kind of television broadcast that will continue to hold an audience . Solid half hours of talk by candidates do not ; debates do . Writing about the 1960 debates , Frank Stanton said : " Straight exposition in any form is always the most difficult way to engage and hold the attention of anyone . Conflict , on the other hand , of ideas in action , is intriguing and engrossing to great numbers of people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 An understanding of that truth is of course the foundation of the highly successful formulas of network television . But it may be many years before Presidential candidates accept that their own interests coincide with those of the public and the television industry in the debate formula . As long as they toy with the television debate , shadow-boxing with the public and the networks , lesser politicians will do the same . Another Kennedy debate In his book Kennedy Campaigning , Murray Levin has given a fascinating account of how , in 1962 , Edward M. Kennedy bor- // rowed his older brother 's techniques for two television debates in Massachusetts . The youngest Kennedy was challenging Edward McCormack , nephew of the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives , John McCormack , in the Democratic primary for Senator . Kennedy was without experience , whereas McCormack was a seasoned state politician who had twice been elected Attorney General of Massachusetts . Campaigning energetically and leaning the weight of his illustrious name on the state convention , Kennedy had edged McCormack out of the nomination he expected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Massachusetts families , McCormack challenged Kennedy in the fall primary . The most important incident in that campaign was a televised debate on August 27 in South Boston . McCormack had challenged Kennedy to eight debates . Kennedy stalled for sixteen days , and then took four days to negotiate . He emerged with an agreement to two debates , having insisted on a format with a panel of newsmen , and on being free to choose the site for the first debate . The choice , the South Boston High School , Levin says , cleverly served to draw attention to what McCormack preferred to live down , the image of the corrupt old South Boston Irish politician . For weeks before the debate , McCormack and his advisers wondered whether they should attack Teddy . Kennedy was known to have a fierce temper and it was argued that if McCormack could provoke him to anger on the television screen , Teddy would be lost . McCormack decided to attack . Teddy came well prepared and gave answers heavily seasoned with place names and topical items in the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCormack opened by charging Teddy with running on his name , not on any qualifications , and said Kennedy 's campaign was insulting to the state . In his summing up , Kennedy was emotional . During his last few sentences ? about the tradition of free speech in Massachusetts ? his voice broke and he appeared to be weeping . Then McCormack delivered the body blow . Turning to Kennedy , he said , " If his name was Edward Moore , with his qualifica174 THE PEOPLE MACHINE tions , with your qualifications , Teddy , if it was Edward Moore , your candidacy would be a joke , but nobody 's laughing because his name is not Edward Moore . It 's Edward Moore Kennedy . . . . " According to Levin , Kennedy sat unbelieving , " stunned , rigid and ashen . " But the result surprised them both . It quickly became clear from newspaper , political and public reaction that Kennedy had won . He had inspired a remarkable wave of sympathy for his courtesy in the face of McCormack 's attack . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers said , like a little lost boy whom all the women wanted to cuddle . McCormack , on the other hand , spoke out of the side of his mouth , sneeringly . They also noticed that McCormack 's head looked strangely little on his shoulders , while Teddy 's was handsome and well-proportioned . On such considerations are TV debates won or lost . Teddy won the primary . Then he was challenged to a television debate by his Republican opponent for the Senate , George Lodge . Kennedy repeatedly refused to take up the challenge . Lodge attempted to embarrass him by holding debates with the Independent third candidate , H. Stuart Hughes , always with a vacant chair to symbolize Kennedy 's absence . It did not help Lodge . The voters of Massachusetts did not hold it against Teddy that he had refused to debate ; they sent him to Washington with 57 percent of the vote . The gentle art of avoiding debates The television debate has grown into such an important yet unpredictable factor that one of the skills a modern campaign manager must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates that might be damaging , without losing face . The interest of the public in hearing a reasoned discussion of the issues is seldom a consideration . This is how Joe Napolitan has revealed he would approach the question : " If 1 had a candidate who was a clear favorite , I 'd try to keep him off TV debates . But I would never openly refuse to debate . If challenged to a debate , you say , yes , sure . How about // my campaign manager meeting yours at 4 P.M. on Thursday ? ' Then at five to four on Thursday , you call and say , We 've had a real crisis here , can we make it on Saturday ? ' And on Saturday you put it off till next Wednesday . . . and so on . " Few politicians can match the Kennedy family in such skills . What John demonstrated in 1960 and Teddy exploited in 1962 , Robert Kennedy adapted to a somewhat different situation in New York in 1964 . His opponent was Kenneth Keating , the silver-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keating had irritated the Kennedys prior to the Cuban missile crisis , by repeatedly charging that the Russians had given Castro offensive missiles . Despite Administration denials , the charges became an issue in the 1962 off-year elections . As it happened , Keating turned out to be right , although evidence displayed by the U.S. Government at the height of the crisis suggested the Senator had been right before the fact . Two years later , Keating found his Senate seat challenged by the man who had been President Kennedy 's right-hand aide throughout the missile crisis . The Kennedy clan suspected Keating of having exploited rumors from Cuban refugees about missile installations for political ends . But Robert Kennedy 's advisers in 1964 recognized that Keating 's public reputation was solid . As mentioned earlier , they did not want Kennedy to debate him if it could be " honorably avoided . " One important Kennedy aide told a reporter : " We 're not going to let him appear with that wise old man . " However , the polls turned against Kennedy and a debate seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not sure whether Keating would want to face a confrontation , Kennedy decided to make the challenge . He proposed that he and Keating buy the time , each paying half , to get around the Equal Time regulation , because there was also a Conservative candidate in the race . The maneuvering began . Keating suggested that there be a panel of young people or no panel with only the two candidates speaking . Kennedy 's reaction was , " Does he call that a debate ? " CBS then offered an hour of prime evening time and both sides // accepted . By the afternoon of the program , however , the candidates still had not agreed on the format . Keating still paid for the first half hour . Gerald Gardner , in Robert Kennedy in New York , says that when Kennedy tried to buy the ' other half hour , he was refused . He telegraphed William Paley , the CBS Board Chairman , in California and secured the half hour . By this time , Keating had announced that he was going to debate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters . Bobby said : " I ca n't let him debate an empty chair . " With a retinue of reporters , Kennedy turned up and demanded to be admitted to the studio where Keating was preparing to go on . A CBS official refused to let him enter . When Keating left after his broadcast , he was besieged by reporters but refused to talk . Aides hurriedly pushed prop furniture in the reporters ' paths , while the candidate escaped . Kennedy went on with his own half hour , with radio personality Barry Gray , and afterward portrayed the incident as a victory . When Keating bought more time on NBC for $10,000 and invited Kennedy to appear , Bobby refused . Most of the New York newspapers regarded this competition in trickery as a draw . It was the conclusion of some experienced reporters that Robert Kennedy never had any intention of debating Keating and that the incident of being locked out of the studio was merely a device . The bumper year for television debates was 1962 , the first general election after Nixon-Kennedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Romney debated John Swainson four times in the gubernatorial election in Michigan and won . Unchastened by his experiences with Kennedy , Richard Nixon confronted California 's Governor Pat Brown on television . They exchanged personal charges and neither was considered a winner , although Brown remained Governor . The art of avoiding debates was already advanced . In Pennsylvania , William Scranton was running against Richardson Dilworth for the governorship . Dilworth kept challenging Scranton to a debate , and when he was refused , arranged to go on television alone with an empty chair . Scranton turned up at the last minute with a bucket of whitewash and walked into the studio accusing Dilworth of trying to smear him . Scranton won the election easily . // It is apparent that politicians are as alert to the hazards of TV debating as they are to the advantages . Many politicians have been frightened off . Others wait indecisively on the sidelines , like nervous gamblers eyeing the roulette wheel , wondering if this is their moment to take a chance . Their nervousness may be killing the genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Presidential debate . After his election , John F. Kennedy had announced that he would take part in TV debates if he were the Democratic candidate in 1964 . The prospect of an incumbent President in such a direct partisan confrontation alarmed some people . A panel formed by the American Political Science Association decided : " It may be contrary to the national interest for the President to engage in debates . " Nevertheless , the panel said that the 1960 debates had added " a useful dimension to American public life " and recommended a series of seven debates between Labor Day and the election . In Political Television , Bernard Rubin suggests several grounds for anxiety about debates involving an incumbent President : he could not be drawn into argument involving his thoughts on delicate matters of national security ; he could not easily attack the policies of allied countries ; success as a partisan spokesman might lessen his effectiveness as the nation 's leader ; and in a crisis that coincided with the debates , the President 's arguments would carry undue weight . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and it is not inevitable that the risks would increase because of the pressures in a debate situation . President Kennedy demonstrated in his press conferences that delicate issues and sharp questions could be safely handled on live television . It is not clear why the debate form would uniquely restrict a President 's freedom to comment on the policies of allied countries . Any policies he did not like would already have brought some response from his Administration , which he could defend . If something new burst on the scene , the President would respond with some public explanation . In the case of a crisis , a President 's arguments inevitably weigh more heavily in public opinion than // the arguments of other politicians . Again , why should TV debates make a difference ? Debates with an incumbent President would perhaps make him a more obviously partisan spokesman than recent Presidents have liked to appear at election time . Still , the dignity of the office is not likely to be casually jettisoned . It is too valuable a commodity at election time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to the test . They might have been in 1964 if President Kennedy had lived . The machinery was already in motion to suspend the Equal Time rule once again . President Kennedy had appointed a Commission on Campaign Costs  --  with Herbert E. Alexander as Executive Director ? which recommended the Equal Time suspension for 1964 . Although there was considerable support in Congress , Alexander said that " it appeared to be high Democratic policy to avoid suspension . " The failure of an otherwise amenable Democratic Congress to pass legislation making debates possible was generally taken to mean that President Johnson did not want to take part in debates . Senator Goldwater challenged the President and offered to pay for the broadcast time . To forestall the national-interest argument , he even offered to have the debates filmed in advance to guard against inadvertent security leaks . But President Johnson did not accept . Politically , Johnson was probably wise . Accepting Senator Goldwater as a debating opponent would have narrowed the credibility gap between the two men . It would have shrunk the psychological distance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters in the middle ground of American politics , inviting Senator Goldwater into the same TV studio with President Johnson would have been to haul him back from the outer reaches of that extremist wasteland to which the Democrats had consigned him . Conservative Republicans , taking the measure of the two men side by side on the TV screen , might have been willing to raise Lyndon Johnson a few notches out of the socialist hell they were convinced he inhabited and was planning for them . But the intention of any healthy politician is the reverse ; it is to put an infinity of wisdom and humanity between himself and his opponent . Debates I 179 Furthermore , Lyndon Johnson did not want mere victory . The earliest polls told him he had that . He wanted a landslide . It is probable that by doing Barry Goldwater the honor of debating with him , Johnson would have lessened the margin of triumph . In that case , his mandate for the vigorous social reforms he initiated after the election would have been less convincing , and possibly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every political ground , his decision not to debate appears right . When the interests of the voter are considered , however , the arguments are different . A useful dialogue between the two candidates was possible . One feature of the President 's campaign was the extreme mistiness of the future he was promising . The Great Society was a personal vision of which he vouchsafed the public only tantalizing glimpses . No one pinned Mr. Johnson down on specific programs . By focusing public attention on the supposed radicalism of the Republican candidate , the President was able to imply a program rather than to delineate one . The voters might have appreciated an effort to make him spell it out . Vietnam was also treated vaguely , the problem being reduced to the proposition : President Johnson seeks no wider war  --  Senator Goldwater does . It was not long after the election that Republicans were jokingly saying : " They told me if I voted for Goldwater we would be bombing Hanoi . So I did and we are ! " It is difficult to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men discuss the issue , in person , for an hour . There is a third consideration : the effectiveness of each of the two men on television . In one sense , Goldwater had gifts more suitable to the medium than Johnson . The Senator was a man refreshingly unstuffy in his approach to politics . Naturally leaning toward informality in moments that put others stiffly on their dignity , he often exhibited an absence of pomposity that made him seem open and undevious . His clean-cut , handsome features reinforced this impression of candor , which showed particularly when he was speaking extemporaneously and not following a text . Mr. Johnson 's television demeanor , on the other hand , has always suggested a man more calculating , a man making an effort // to ingratiate himself with the millions . He has often seemed like an insincere preacher at a routine funeral , twisting his features to look grieved . By all accounts he was inhibited by the example of Kennedy 's graceful mastery of television . Yet everyone who has ever talked at length with Lyndon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forceful individual in politics . Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , for one , telling of being exposed to the Johnson " treatment , " says that he " staggered away in a condition of exhaustion , " feeling he had been " under hypnosis. " 13 In common with many reporters who traveled with the Johnson campaign in 1964 , I found myself overwhelmed by the first encounters with the burst-dam quality of his personality . Freed of the unctuous manner he adopts when speaking directly to the television camera , the President was a man who projected genuine charm and concern . It is difficult to believe that these qualities would not have emerged in a television debate . Mr. Johnson made no effort to get Congress to permit Presidential debates in 1964 but his withdrawal from the campaign stimulated new efforts in 1968 . Richard Nixon and Vice-President Humphrey , the two leading Presidential hopefuls , both said they favored such action by Congress . Nixon rejected requests by his Republican rival , Governor Nelson Rockefeller , for a preconvention debate , but shortly before the GOP convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' advice , he would be willing to debate the Democratic nominee . When he made this statement , however , the measure that would have made a Presidential debate possible was still bogged down in committee . In the struggle for the Democratic nomination , Senator Robert Kennedy dodged a debate with Senator Eugene McCarthy until McCarthy defeated him in the Oregon primary . It was a measure of Kennedy 's desperation that he consented to a joint appearance on ABC in California on June 1 . Most commentators gave the " debate " to Kennedy because he appeared more aggressive , although McCarthy benefited from the exposure . Kennedy 's victory in the California primary three days later was less substantial than many observers thought he would have needed ( had he lived ) to give him the momentum to win the nomination . Debates ! 181 By ingeniously calling the Kennedy-McCarthy confrontation a " special edition " of Issues and Answers , ABC did not have to give equal time to other candidates . Regularly scheduled news and news interview programs are exempt . In 1961 , Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make TV debates a permanent feature of American campaigns , said he could not believe that any responsible politicians would seek to resume outlawing them . " It would certainly be incredible cynicism , " he said , " for any public official to conclude that the people were entitled to see and hear candidates in face-to-face discussions only when it served the political interests of a candidate . " 14 It was incredible ? and it was true . Campaigning by Commercial On the screen , two GI 's crouch near the ground , talking about the war . They think it is futile and can see no goal worth fighting for . Suddenly , shooting breaks out again and one of the men is hit . The other GI sees his buddy die , and then , in his frustration , deliberately exposes himself to the enemy and is killed . An announcer 's voice urges , " Vote Republican . " It is not 1968 , but 1952 ? the Korean War . This melodramatic commercial was one of the first ever made to sell a political candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a startling innovation is the rule . In that time , politicians have virtually abandoned television as a campaign platform , preferring to concentrate their money and ingenuity on its power to make a selling pitch . By the 1968 Presidential election , with a tormented country desperately needing rational debate , political argument on the airwaves has largely been reduced to one-minute commercials . The crude radio commercials broadcast on behalf of President Johnson in New Hampshire , accusing Senator Eugene McCarthy of helping the Communists in Vietnam by advocating " fuzzy thinking and surrender , " indicated to what depths even the White House had been brought by the availability of mass advertising . In the same period , the new managers have not been blind to the opportunities afforded by free television . Before we examine the latest techniques for exploiting , paid television , let us see how politicians secure valuable exposure at no cost at all . 182 // Ever since politicians first began to use the broadcasting media to reach voters , some have claimed that the industry should not be making them pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that the airwaves broadcasters used belonged to the public ; radio and television exploited the airwaves profitably , under a franchise ; and a condition of that franchise , laid down in the Federal Communications Act of 1934 , was that broadcasters should operate " in the public interest . " What could be more truly in the public interest than to provide an opportunity to hear the issues confronting the nation discussed by candidates at election time ? The broadcasters did not agree , on the grounds that the government had saddled them with a regulation that tied their hands at election time . Under Section 315 of the 1934 Act , broadcasters must give equal time to all candidates for a particular political office . If there are two candidates for a Senate seat , for example , and a television station gives one of them a half hour of free time to make his pitch , an equal amount of time must be offered to his opponent . If there should be five candidates for that seat and one is given a half hour , each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The regulation appears most onerous and ridiculous to broadcasters in Presidential campaigns . In addition to the two , and sometimes three , serious contenders , there are inevitably a host of lesser candidates , sometimes as many as fifteen , representing fringe groups like the American Beat Party , the Church of God Party and the Vegetarian Party . If the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates were given an hour of network time each , by law each of the others would have to be treated equally . The television industry has campaigned vigorously to have the regulation removed , so far without success . The Equal Time provision does not apply to appearances for which the candidates pay , except that if a television station sells time to one candidate it must be willing to sell it to the others . The broadcasters quickly found it in their hearts to sell virtually as much time as candidates could afford to buy , with the result that candidates with big campaign funds swamp the airwaves and the poorer ones disappear . There have been three kinds of response to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeal the Equal Time provision . Another has been to try to overcome the inequalities of exposure imposed by the enormous cost of television by finding some way to finance campaigns with public funds . President Johnson proposed such a system in 1967 , but Congress did not act on it . A third response , which has attracted less attention than the others , is the increasingly skillful exploitation by candidates of the free time that is available . In 1959 , the FCC removed regular news and news-interview programs from the Equal Time restriction . The only condition remaining is that broadcasters are still required to be " fair " in their treatment of candidates . For instance , in 1964 , if President Johnson spent a day campaigning in New York and a five-minute report appeared that evening on Walter Cronkite , the Republican candidate was not entitled to mathematically equal time on the same program . CBS was required , under the Fairness Doctrine , to ensure that , on balance , during the campaign , the Republican views were presented as thoroughly in news programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappier than the Equal Time provision , for reasons we shall see later . Now , with hours of television news and panel programs open to them every week , the new campaign managers have made it part of their art to get their candidates on those programs . Their skill is considerable , although television often makes it very easy for them . By appearing on a television news program , the candidate is guaranteed an audience that has some interest in public affairs and is predisposed to consider them at that time of day . He is not competing with entertainment programs and runs no risk of antagonizing the audience by preempting its regular fare . The audience , as we have seen , is an almost perfect demographic cross section of the electorate . For this audience largely dependent upon television for its information about current events , news programs form the windows to their minds : if a candidate is to reach them , those windows are the openings where there may be least resistance . Perhaps the most important benefit is the intuition of authority Campaigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are happening in the cities , the country and the world , they are told , and it is on news programs that they learn about those happenings . A man whose activities are part of the news is credible , his doings have the authority of a news event . He is a bona fide news happening , not a commercial . And he is , if we believe the surveys quoted earlier , a more believable event on television than he is in a newspaper or magazine report . The major disadvantage to a candidate is that he can not control all the aspects of an appearance on a news program . He can not edit the film and write the commentary . But if he is alert to the possibilities , he can control a great deal . His campaign manager must first have a real understanding of the value of the " pseudo event . " To make television and the other news media cover his activities , he must invent happenings which are likely to interest them . They are not real events because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the old days of campaigning , a candidate tried to meet and speak to as many people as he could . Today , if he understands his business , he still goes about meeting people and speaking , but he does not do it with those voters principally in mind . His attention is directed to the hundreds of times greater number of voters who will see him that evening on the television news . If the events of his campaign are too repetitive , the coverage will dwindle , so there must be constant variety . The speeches he delivers must make different points and the type of setting should vary . But , principally , he should be placed in circumstances where something news-like will happen . If the first sentence that comes to the mind of a reporter summing up the day is : " Republican senatorial candidate Charles Percy today continued his campaigning through southern Illinois . . . " Percy has not succeeded . If the day can be constructed so as to provide a lead sentence like : " Senatorial candidate Charles Percy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago , " the incident has the appearance of an event . While it has always been an elementary rule not to run a dull campaign , television 's hunger for visual incident has made that precept imperative . Television hunger has also made it easier . As we have seen , in // recent years the network evening news reports have expanded from fifteen minutes to thirty , and there is pressure to make them an hour long . The local news programs which precede the network shows have been lengthened to one hour by many stations . They can be very profitable for the stations but they consume what is for television a staggering amount of material . With so insatiable an appetite to feed , a candidate who runs a creative campaign has an excellent situation to exploit . This is less true for Presidential campaigns ? which will attract constant TV coverage in any case ? than for congressional , gubernatorial or municipal races , where the coverage on local stations might be sporadic . Election coverage for television is an arduous business in which technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of properly exposed film on the air , that the editorial considerations often come last . The campaign manager who enters most sympathetically into the problems of television journalism will be rewarded by the coverage his candidate gets . Television covers an election by sending reporters and film crews to record the doings of the candidates . There is always an early deadline to meet . They must return with the film to their own station ( or , if a network crew , to an affiliate station ) , where the film can be processed and edited and the commentary added . That may mean breaking off from the campaign as much as five hours before air time . The alert campaign manager , therefore , will try not only to devise an event interesting enough to bring the TV people out , but schedule it before the early afternoon , when they must leave . If a TV crew wants to travel with the candidate 's plane , the manager should do his utmost to permit it and to let them film whatever they want . Holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be first off an aircraft or a bus in order to get a shot they want ; providing an extra car in a motorcade for TV equipment ; or getting the candidate to exchange a few words with a TV reporter who has to leave to make a program deadline is a small price to pay for the exposure that results . Some politicians have gone so far as to do some of the broadcasters ' work . In Michigan , in 1966 , Governor Romney 's campaign apparatus regularly produced tapes of his remarks , already Campaigning by Commercial 1 187 edited for use , which were made available to radio stations . The Romney people estimated that they received half a million dollars in free radio coverage with that device . If broadcasting pieces preselected by a political candidate seems an abdication of journalistic responsibility , such a lapse is certainly not going to worry the candidate . Bob Price , campaign manager and later Deputy Mayor for John Lindsay , thinks it is easy to use the television stations in New York . " You have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you are imaginative you can get them to use thirty seconds on any news program . In New York City , it 's duck soup . You just have to think of the personality of the individual TV newsman and think in terms of what he is likely to use . " 1 Although Governor Nelson Rockefeller spent over $5 million to be reelected in 1966 , his staff were very alert to the opportunities news programs provided . Leslie Slote , the Governor 's press secretary , says it is easier to get the cameras out during a campaign than in day-to-day affairs . " It needs inventiveness , " he says . " The challenge is when they get there to make it good . " 2 He referred to the efforts of Rockefeller 's chief opponent in 1966 , Democrat Frank O'Connor . For a variety of reasons ? late nomination , too little money and too many advisers ? the O'Connor campaign had an amateurish air . Frequently , reporters would turn up at a place designated on the campaign schedule to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O'Connor would be seen pacing on an empty street corner or talking to people who were hostile . One night in late fall , the campaign motorcade with O'Connor , his aides and the press was streaming along a road outside New York City . The lead car made a confident turn off the highway , all the other cars followed and the press found themselves sitting with the candidate in a deserted drive-in movie theater ? which had been closed for the winter . It was not the same in Rockefeller 's campaign , where the effect of every campaign stop was calculated . Slote went on : " It 's not difficult getting the cameras out . It 's showing up the Governor in a setting of enthusiasm and response . One of the keys is young people . We had lots of rallies at schools and universities . Most people are working during the days but there are always people at // the schools . He goes to a school and there are six hundred kids . The Governor shakes hands and the TV cameras are cranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The locals will see it that night on the local station . In the middle of that sort of day we would stick a Kiwanis luncheon in as a way of getting the media . " All three Kennedys showed great ability to attract the attention of the media to their activities , both between campaigns and during . It did not happen accidentally . When Senator Robert Kennedy appeared in a full front-page photograph in the New York Daily News , leaning in the door of a squalid Puerto Rican tenement in Spanish Harlem , it was not a coincidence that the photographer was there . Nor was he pulled there by a high-pressure public relations man calling to say , " Hey , we 've got a great picture for you today . " It was all managed more subtly , but it was managed . It is much easier for an incumbent than a challenger . In the opinion of his critics , President Johnson 's sudden flight to Honolulu for a conference on Vietnam during the 1966 Senate hearings on the war was the pseudo event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the newspapers and television shows were full of the Honolulu conference . However much the White House denied it at the time , the conference was very suddenly arranged and did divert public attention from the hearings , which were heavy with criticism of the Administration . The need for visual incident to give variety and action to a television news program can have political effects that worry serious journalists in the medium . The practice is less true in the news departments of the major networks , which are peopled by trained journalists , than in the news operations of local stations around the country . There are more than six hundred of these and many of them still do not have extensive news resources , either in facilities or in personnel . Whenever a political candidate turns up , there is competitive anxiety to put him on the local news . In the rush and excitement of getting to the politician and recording an interview , the last thing that may be considered is the content of the interview . The interviewer may be so preoccupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninformed as to Campaigning by Commercial 189 let the politician simply walk away with the occasion . Such interviewing results in little more than a public relations exercise for the politician . Television viewers , seeing the interview on a news program in the context of other , real events , may give it the benefit of the same trust they bring to that station 's other news items . Nor are such lapses unknown at the network news level . For economic reasons , however , the local station may be particularly vulnerable . To send out a cameraman and have him expose a roll of sound film ( four hundred feet , or ten minutes , is the standard length ) is an investment which stations operating on small news budgets can not afford to sacrifice . Even if the politician 's speech , news conference or private interview results in nothing significant or newsworthy , it is difficult not to run it once the film has been exposed and processed . For that reason , politicians both during campaigns and in normal times get uncritical television exposure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly valuable exposure because they are scheduled most often on the fringes of prime time , just before 7:30 P.M. , when the large audience for the evening 's entertainment programming is beginning to build up , or just after 11:00 P.M. , before the big audience goes to bed . Other opportunities for free television exposure , the regular panel or interview programs , usually occur on the weekends , when the audience is smaller , but their effect is still important . Almost every television station runs at least one half-hour public affairs program a week as a comparatively inexpensive way of demonstrating public service . The most influential of such programs are these on the three networks on Sunday afternoons : Meet the Press ( NBC ) , Face the Nation ( CBS ) and Issues and Answers ( ABC ) . Appearance on such programs is by invitation , and to a relatively unknown figure an invitation from a network can be an important event ( for example , the appearance of Edward Kennedy in 1962 on Meet the Press ) . Prominent politicians are invited often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and can have an influence on the momentum of a campaign . Robert Kennedy agreed to appear on Meet the Press during his 1964 New York senatorial campaign only after careful thought and prepara190 THE PEOPLE MACHINE tion . He followed closely the standards set by the late President in schooling himself for such an appearance . The day before the program , Kennedy spent several hours on the lawn of Gracie Mansion , the official residence of New York 's then Democratic Mayor , Robert Wagner , with a group of advisers . Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , flew in from Washington to join the others in throwing at the candidate every hostile and tricky question they could think of . Programs of this nature have an important built-in advantage for politicians in that the panels of questioners tend to protect them as much as they expose them . Competition among members of the panel each to shine with his own favorite questions may prevent any searching pursuit of a subject . Meet the Press , in particular , often conveys the impression that it is being much tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politician knows how to exploit this appearance of being under attack and gain audience sympathy . In March , 1968 , two days after his announcement that he was entering the Presidential race , Robert Kennedy again appeared on Meet the Press . His motives at the time were being severely questioned . By repeatedly diverting the discussion away from the harm he might do to Eugene McCarthy and by advertising his wider concern for the fate of the country , Kennedy probably helped to make his candidacy more acceptable . These interview programs may not be good exposure for a candidate who is too exhausted from campaigning to bring a fresh mind to the studio . One of the incidents most harmful to Senator Goldwater occurred in May , 1964 , shortly before the California primary , where victory was thought to be crucial to his nomination . Appearing on Issues and Answers , he seemed to suggest that atomic weapons could be used to defoliate the jungle trails used by the Communists in Vietnam . At least , that was the way the Associated Press interpreted Goldwater in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country a few minutes after his appearance . That was the last thing Goldwater should have been saying , from a point of view of campaign tactics . His opponent in California , Governor Rockefeller , had kept Goldwater on the defensive on " the bomb " issue all year . A major effort of Goldwater 's California campaign was to escape from that // issue while reassuring people that he did not have an itchy trigger finger for nuclear weapons . As soon as they heard of the Associated Press version , Goldwater 's press people quickly produced the full text , but the operative sentences were ambiguous enough to keep reporters seeking clarification for the next two weeks . " There have been several suggestions made , " Goldwater had told Howard K. Smith on the program . " I do n't think that we would use any of them . But defoliation of the forests by low-yield atomic weapons might well be done . " However valuable such nationwide exposure may be , it is quite possible to turn it to disadvantage if the candidate does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preparation . In 1960 , forty-four editions of these three network interview programs were devoted to politics , thirteen of them in the final two weeks . In 1964 , there were twenty-eight during the campaign . At thirty minutes a program , that adds up to a great deal of free television time for the candidates , or supporters , who can use them well . In addition , the networks mount a number of political news specials and documentaries in election years , in which politicians in prominent races are covered . Like regular news programs , they have the advantage of giving the politician wide exposure in a context not manufactured by his own publicity apparatus . For the most part , a candidate is treated gently on such programs because television does not usually consider itself as free as newspapers to put politicians under too searching or unfavorable a spotlight . Even when television has decided , because of the personality of the reporter or producer , to attempt a deeper analysis of a man , time limitations work against it . Campaign specials tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with five or seven minutes devoted to each race in a series . Often that is simply not enough time to be thorough . Herbert Mitgang , a journalist who returned to the New York Times in 1967 after several years with CBS News , has said : " I ca n't think of one profile either of a general nature or of a national political figure that really stripped away the sham and allowed the correspondent to be as outspoken as Reston and Wicker two Times columnists are in the press . " 3 Mitgang further said that at
