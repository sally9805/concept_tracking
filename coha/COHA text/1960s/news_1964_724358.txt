txt Staggering under a load that increases by nearly 5,000 persons a month , New York City is fighting what at best is only a holding action against its welfare problems . For the problems are the product of urban poverty across the land , and such poverty can not be successfully attacked without massive Federal assistance , the city administration emphasizes . Welfare is now the city 's thirdlargest expenditure , exceeded only by schools and debt retirement . Welfare Commissioner James R , Dumpson said in an interview yesterday that " if we are really serious about antipoverty and reducing our welfare rolls , the $900 million-plus in the Johnson Administration 's antipoverty bill , is only a small drop in the bucket . " 300,000 Children Aided Mayor Wagner has been equally blunt . The cost of the antipoverty program is " beyond the capacity of the city , " he said recently , warning that New York must seek more Federal and state aid for such imperative needs as immediate improvement in education , housing , job training and jobs . There are 501,131 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's population , receiving some form of public assistance . About 300,000 are children , living in crowded slums , playing on garbage - littered streets . Their clothes are usually shabby ; milk and meat are rare luxuries . The welfare rolls list only " cases , " ' not " families , " for there is no other appropriate way to record the aid given to a woman who has had five children by five different men ; to a child deserted by his father ; to parents of youngsters who drift from corner to corner and who often sleep in doorways and on stoops . ' Known-as ' Little Dynamo ' Thus , the 501,131 persons who were , receiving ? - some sort of welfare aid as of Sept. 30 , when the ' last tabulation was made , represent 200,649 cases , which were granted a total of $37 , - , , 038,837 in September . A year ago it was $5.4 million less for the month . The man in charge of trying to alleviate this mounting misery is Mr. Dumpson , a slightly built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critics of welfare , is known for his zeal in guarding public funds from waste . Mr. Dumpson has been nick- ' named " Little Dynamo " by his fellow workers because of his long work hours . He has been Welfare Commissioner since 1959 . A self-assured , confident man who at 55 dresses in conservative , blue pin-striped suits , he looks more like a bank president than a harassed social service director . He said , however : " I 've just come from my doctor and he fears I have all sorts of stomach ailments . " I told the Mayor that a man should only hold this job about five years , and I 'll probably leave it soon . I want to live , not get sick . " He sees " no end in sight " for welfare departments or welfare payments . His is not an agency that can put itself out of business by succeeding like , for example , the city 's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration . Rather , it is more like a municipal middleman between the poor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a cure for poverty . The welfare department has become throughout the country a municipal whipping post . Here and elsewhere , there is a vast category of cases in which persons who are on public welfare somehow find the money to buy expensive fur coats ; addicts who use their welfare payments for narcotics ; and even some persons who get welfare checks while they hold good jobs . Lowest Rate in U. S. Mr. Dumpson is not disturbed by this . New York , he said , has the country 's lowest rate of ineligible persons on its welfare rolls . Those who are ineligible are continually being weeded out , he said . " Even among the number we have , many are getting welfare because a staff member , newly trained , does n't understand the procedure or the law , " he said . " Many others go to the wrong department and are put on the rolls . A surprising number are not getting as much as they are entitled to under the laws . " Of those who get some sort of welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? at least 75 per cent are Negroes and Puerto Ricans . Out of an estimated population of 8,090,000 in September , 1,320,000 are Negroes and 675,000 , Puerto Ricans . However , the ' Welfare Department statistics show that four out of five Negroes and Puerto Ricans here are employed , and , that most do not receive even supplemental aid from available welfare funds . But the welfare figures keep going up . " It 's been rising for three years . The figures go up because the birth rate goes up . the - population goes up , " Mr. Dumpson said . Flow of the Unskilled A big cause of the growing welfare rolls is the flow of unskilled , poorly educated Negroes from the South to New York and Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico , although the latter migration is decreasing . The answer to this is better education , better housing and more job retraining , Mr. Dumpson believes . Automation kills off , he noted , the very jobs these people do . It is hoped in the city Welfare Department that the Civil Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program  --  will help drain away welfare cases by eventually opening up more job opportunities for Negroes throughout the country , particularly in the South . A total of $244,773,000 was originally budgeted here for public assistance for the fiscal year ending June 30 . The City Council later transferred an additional $7,344,000 to the department . For the 1965-66 fiscal year , the department has estimated that the budget for public assistance in the city must rise by about $71 million . Commenting on continuing criticism of the spiraling wel1 fare costs , Mr. Dumpson said : " Nobody , but nobody , in this country of ours , in terms of our cultural values , has too much respect for dependency . " Nobody likes to have his tax money used for dependency  --  for people they do n't like . We take care of ourselves , sometimes not even our own families , and we attack people who are dependent , rather than the cause of their dependency . " Allotment of Cost Of the 501,131 persons who received welfare aid last September , 464,867 of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such basic items as rent , food and clothing . This totaled $32,251,247 , of which roughly a third was paid by the city , a third by the Federal Government and a third by the state . The remaining persons received aid for such items as foster care for children , the money for which comes from the city Controller 's office , and for hospital care . These funds come from the Department of Hospitals budget . The cost for the 501,131 persons of $37,338,837 , came to $186.09 a case and $74.51 a person . In September , 1963 , 442,819 persons received public aid here . The budget was $31,911,202 , or $176.02 a case and $72.06 a person . The largest single-item in the Welfare Department 's budget consists of aid to dependent children ? $15,578,660 last September , and $12,564,451 in September , 1963 . An even more stark picture of the Welfare Department 's growing problems can be seen in the yearly figures . Direct public assistance in the budget year ending last June cost $416,630,313 , as compared with $339,515,137 for the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from $83,777,074 to $95,236,066 , and foster care for children rose from $52,191,531 to $64,131,167 . The total went up by more James R. Dumpson is city 's Commissioner of Welfare . than $10 million  --  from $475 , - 476,000 to $575.997,000 . In terms . of people , about 58 , - 000 more persons received welfare aid last September than in September , 1963 ; 501,131 as compared with 442,819 . The Welfare Department says that its rolls are increasing at the ' rate of just under 5,000 persons per month . These persons filter through 23 welfare offices in the city . They include a tall , overweight , 26-year-old woman with a pretty face and large , warm , brown eyes , three children and no husband . She lives in a threeroom apartment , badly in need of paint and floor covering . Her only income is a check for $94 from the city every 15 days . What she does with that check depends on a variety of things : her thyroid condition , which keeps her overweight ; the need for shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Each month she also gets 19 packages of food with- a retail value of $17.50 from the Federal food surplus program . Another woman  --  Mrs. M ? receives $3,224 a year from the department for herself and four children . She pays $90 a month for her slum apartment , and she has not had a new dress in 11 years . Mrs. A , another " case , " is 47 and the mother of two . Her husband deserted her two years ago , and every 15 days she receives $99 from the department . Every two weeks $46 of this goes to her landlord for the rent of a sagging , Lower East Side apartment . She is left with less than $4 a day for food , clothing and the other necessities . Slumlords Get Money Much of the criticism directed against the Welfare Department is that a large portion of its aid goes to the ' support of slumlords . But , Mr. Dumpson points out , in many cases there is simply no other housing available for welfare cases . He said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our families simply can not afford it . When they are relocated while the housing is going up , we often have to place them in apartments that are not under rent control . " And , under the law , the City Housing Authority . which builds and maintains the low-rent public housing here , has virtually run out of funds to build more . An example of the type of housing in which welfare recipients often live is the Bryn Mawr , a six-story building at ' 420 West 121st Street near Amsterdam Avenue . Its exterior is practically indistinguishable from other buildings in the area , most of which are inhabited by middle - income families . But the Bryn Mawr has become a magnet for narcotics addicts and prostitutes : ? 50 arrests have been made on ' its premises in the last 44 I months . The Bryn Mawr 's tenants are for the most part Negroes , and many are on public welfare . But , Mr. Dumpson said , " As long as there is a housing shortage in this city we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeks Changes Mr. Dumpson has called for a umber of changes in the laws and the policies of the welfare program . " We must rethink the soundness of the ' means test ' as the cornerstone for eligibility , " he said , so that applicants will not be stripped " of all vestiges of selfrespect and dignity . " He also urged that a " more realistic " policy for " considering an accounting of income of persons in receipt of public assistance " so that their incentive " to self-support may be strengthened rather than discouraged . " Under the city Welfare laws , for example , a man entitled to $60 a week in welfare has no incentive to get a $50-a-week job . If he did get such a job , he would get $10 a week in aid . But Mr. Dumpson ? up to a point that would be determined ? would like the- law to allow the man to keep the salary check and a greater part of the welfare contribution . In b housine. , Mr. Dumpson would amend law to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-income families in middle-income developments . Wants Reorganization He said he would like to see the department entirely reorganized , so that it could undertake more extensive programs to prevent dependency . Another proposal by Mr. Dumpson  --  a controversial one ? would be the " repeal of all laws that relate residence and ' worthiness ' to eligibility for public assistance . " His plan , actually , would not apply to New York . But in many states a person must live in the state for a certain length of time before being eligible for welfare . In addition , he must be considered " worthy ' ? in a moral sense : Thus an unmarried mother , for example , might have a hard time getting welfare funds . " When I leave this job , " Mr. Dumpson said , pointing to the chair in his office , " I would like to challenge all those who have written newspaper articles about welfare to sit in this seat , and I 'd say to them , ' You 've criticized  --  you have the job now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
