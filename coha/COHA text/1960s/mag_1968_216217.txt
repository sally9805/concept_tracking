Church in Crisis <P> Sir : Exalt ye citizens of the secular state , for the Roman Catholic Bishops of the U.S. , supposedly in communion with the See of Peter , have essentially repudiated the legitimate teachings of the Roman Pontiff Nov. 22 . Who knows , these enlightened individuals may next choose to elect their own " assistant Pope " who somehow will share the teaching authority of the Pontiff . And someday the Church of Rome may be declared to be nothing more than a schismatic sect ! <P> GERALD MICHAEL SCHNABEL Assistant Professor of History Bemidji State College Bemidji , Minn . <P> <P> Sir : " Saintly reformers " among the dissidents in the Catholic Church ? You 've got to be kidding . When did the church ever canonize anyone for pride and disobedience ? It is the Holy Father who is holding the church together . Nowadays , everyone is infallible but the Pope . <P> And what 's this about traditional Catholics being " peasants " and uneducated ?

Human beings need a religion based on compassion and understanding , as opposed to one that emphasizes the threat of hell . Catholicism will truly be tried when it unshackles the compact majority and forces it to make its own decisions on matters of faith and morals .

" If he were alive , I think he might agree that it is being tried now . <P> CONSTANCE MALAK Madison , Wis . <P> Sir : The Vatican 's inflexibility with respect to altering long-held dogmas should surprise no one .

On all the significant issues-birth control , divorce , abortion , censorship - the church has n't budged an inch . <P> GARDNER WHITCOMB Manhattan <P> Sir : Perhaps Cardinal O'Boyle is at least partly correct when he says that many of us wish to tear down everything and put nothing in its place . We do , indeed , put " no thing " in its place . We put what we find to be true relationship with God there . And that 's not a " thing . " We find it a very real abstract . <P> If we continue to communicate our conscientious internalizations of faith with one another , we will continue to see the natural , healthy tension that is keeping-or making-us more alive than we 've been in years .
