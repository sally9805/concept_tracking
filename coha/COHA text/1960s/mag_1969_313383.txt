Tension of Too Much Success <P> West Germany has become Europe 's pre-eminent economic power , and the Deutsche Mark the world 's strongest currency . The country 's very strength , however , is now a source of tension and trouble both inside and outside Germany . Twice within seven months , a speculative rush to buy marks has weakened the finances of West Germany 's al lies and roiled international monetary affairs . At home , the blessings of prosperity now threaten to turn into the pangs of inflation . What happens in Germany next will have a vital effect on all of Europe . <P> The fear of inflation has been heightened by the enormous increase in the country 's financial reserves . During the latest money crisis last month , $4 billion in francs , pounds , dollars and other foreign funds flowed into Germany . As of last week , almost $3 billion of it was still there . The influx has not only overinflated Germany 's money supply but depressed the monetary reserves of France and Britain . <P> Germany 's surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the country 's economic surge will continue , probably at a perilously fast pace . The output of German factories so far this year has leaped 17% . Last week Bonn announced that its foreign-trade surplus in April rose to $325 million , compared with $275 million in April 1968 .

By recent estimates of the German Bundesbank , Germany 's goods now cost an average of 7% less than those of its major trading partners . Since the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly surprising that German exports to the U.S. climbed 38% last year . As the world 's most successful exporters , the Germans in 1968 sold $25 billion worth of machinery , vehicles , chemicals , plastics and other products to foreign nations . That was far more than any other country except the U.S. With an economy larger than that of all Western Europe , the U.S. had 1968 exports of $33.4 billion . <P> The latest bulge in Germany 's foreign trade started three years ago , when a credit squeeze followed by a recession shrank domestic demand . In response , German businessmen turned to aggressive selling abroad . The economy soon rebounded , but recession-cut German prices never caught up with those in other countries . For industrial products , Germany 's principal exports , many prices not only failed to rise but actually fell . Retail prices of electric ranges , washing machines , refrigerators , watches and TV sets declined slightly in the past year .
