IN THE days when Lewisohn Stadium , scene of New York 's summer concerts , was being built , a story was told of three planners who were consulted on its design and operations . The first said : " We 'll charge two dollars a ticket and cover the seats with velvet . " The second said : " No , we 'll charge one dollar a ticket and cover the seats with cloth . " Whereupon the third smiled wisely and said : " You 're both wrong . We 'll charge a quarter a ticket and cover the seats with people . " . And that is how Lewisohn Stadium- was built , as anyone who has sat upon its hard concrete tiers ( cushions a quarter extra ) can attest . No such homely philosophy prevails at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts , the vast agglomeration of cultural edifices now beginning to rise in midtown Manhattan . Nothing can so well describe both the scope and the spirit of Lincoln Center as words taken from one of its own promotional brochures issued during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a fourteen-acre site in the heart of New York it will build seven theatres , concert halls , and educational buildings to be used to bring the finest art to the greatest numbers . The Center will be unlike any other in the world today . Nowhere else will there be such an assemblage of great institutions . . . . The buildings at Lincoln Center and the park and plaza which will surround them will give New York a new landmark that will stand for more than a hundred years as a proud monument to American architectural skill . Future generations of visitors from America and abroad will come to Lincoln Center as they now visit great landmarks in Venice , Athens , and Rome : just for the joy of being there , Lincoln Center will make New Yorkers proud . It will make America proud . It is doubtful whether the builders of St. Mark 's , the Acropolis , or the Colosseum were half so sanguine about their enterprises . But if the prose of Lincoln Center 's public statements has too often been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts , the project 's reason for being is essentially an artistic one . The point is constantly stressed that its aim is to " strengthen our performing arts , " " whet the artistic appetite of the nation , " provide a " bold and timely answer to the ' cultural explosion ' taking place in America today , " " make New York City ? indeed make America ? the performing-arts capital of the world . " Originally , the Lincoln Center project received its impetus from the need to find new homes for two of America 's major musical institutions , the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic . The former need was longer-standing , for the Met 's 1883-vintage house has long been inadequate ; but the latter was more pressing , for when the Center was started , the Philharmonic 's house at Carnegie Hall was believed to be doomed to demolition . As it turned out , these fears were as exaggerated as Mark Twain 's premature obituary , for without the Philharmonic 's directors ' lifting a finger to help , Carnegie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlist the interest of the state and city governments . But with buildings for the Metropolitan and the Philharmonic as its nucleus , with Fordham University building a downtown campus just below it , with new apartment houses on its western fringes strengthening its status as a slum-clearance project , Lincoln Center was able to expand and diversify with all the zest of a supermarket opening up new departments . A generous gift of $3 million from Mrs. Beaumont Alien assured the addition of a repertory drama theatre . The Juilliard School of Music agreed to come iii as the major educational institution on the scene , even though this involved substantial changes in its traditional pedagogical patterns in order to provide a new drama department and to concentrate on advanced students of music rather than undergraduates . The New York Public Library decided to move its musical departments into the new complex , despite objections of scholars who were used to the old locations . And to accommodate ballet attractions and possibly light summer entertainment , a Ballet-Operetta Theatre was added to the plans . Lincoln Center , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises ? or at least it intends to run them as little as it can . Instead , it regards each of its constituent members ? the Met , the Philharmonic , the proposed Repertory Theatre , Juilliard ? as master in its own house . And yet at Lincoln Center , according to an official brochure , " The whole is greater than the sum of its parts , " and the constituents will seek for " common artistic goals . " But what , exactly , will be the artistic policies that control the operations of Lincoln Center ? Who , if anybody , is really going to run the show ? What does the cultural , artistic , and entertainment life of New York City stand to gain from Lincoln Center ? or does it stand to gain anything at all ? And where , among the graceful arches , glass facades , climbing columns , and spacious promenades , will that well-known but sometimes neglected patron of the arts , the cash customer , find his place ? THE MET GETS ITS WAY 0 N ANY map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look when it is completed , one institution dominates all the rest , At its front and sides , soaring arches open out upon the Center in three directions . From its rear rises a seventeen-story office tower . Around it are clustered , like satellites , the Center 's other buildings and facilities ? the Dance Theatre and Philharmonic Hall flanking its approaches , the Drama Theatre and Juilliard on its left hand , a band shell and a park on its right . This key building , this center of the Center . is of course the Metropolitan Opera . It will be by far the most imposing , the must elegant , the most costly ( $37,400,000 ) , the most elaborate ( just one of its facilities is a restaurant seating 300 diners ) . But the Metropolitan 's dominance of Lincoln Center extends to other realms than the physical . For even more significant than its height , grandeur , and placement is the simple practical fact that it contains the largest auditorium on the premises , a hall seating an audience of 3,800 ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the one it is intended to replace . And the mere possession of the most capacious theatre not only in Lincoln Center but in the entire city ( aside from movie houses ) will give the Metropolitan a powerful voice in determining who besides itself uses that theatre ? and when . Actually New York today is far less of a big-theatre town than it was a generation ago . An old-time ( but still very active ) impresario , Sol Hurok , can reel Off , like a stockbroker reciting quotations , the capacities of theatres past : Hippodrome-4,700 seats ; Manhattan Opera House-3,300 seats ; Century Opera House-3,200 seats ; Lexington Opera House-3,100 seats . " Those , " says Hurok with nostalgia , " were the days of theatres . " Nowadays , when an impresario like Hurok brings over a major ballet company like the Royal or the Bolshoi or the Moiseyev , he can play it profitably only at the Metropolitan Opera House , which has 3,600 seats and room for 200 standees . That means he is forced to time its arrival for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Met season . And since not even an extended run at the Opera House is always sufficient to meet audience demand , Hurok sometimes plays a few extra shows at Madison Square Garden just to take care of the overflow . In effect , no big ballet or opera company from abroad can play in New York from October I to April 15 , while the Metropolitan Opera is in town either performing or rehearsing . Lincoln Center 's design will perpetuate this situation rather than remedy it . It will do so , moreover , at a time when , thanks to increasing international cultural exchange and to jet transportation , more such visits are going to be in the air ? literally as well as figuratively ? than ever before . Lincoln Center 's answer to this problem is to propose not a change in building plans but a revolution in New York 's concert- and ballet-going habits . " We 're trying to force the expression ' offseason ' out of die vocabulary , " says Reginald Allen , the Center 's executive director of operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure year-round operations , and we expect to keep the new Metropolitan Opera House open and occupied forty-six weeks a year ? forty-two at the minimum . " To which one concert manager replies : " The season is the season . In July and August people are gone from the city , and in June who wants to go to the ballet , even with air conditioning ? Even right after Labor Day is too early . The off-season is definitely out . " The chance of a major foreign opera company coming to New York during the most desirable months of the year will be even dimmer than those of a ballet troupe . Despite the fact that most Metropolitan directors are living exemplars of the free-enterprise system , no prospect displeases the Met more than the prospect of competition . No resident company has given it serious trouble since it bought oft Oscar Hammerstein 's Manhattan Opera opposition in 1910 for $1,200,000 , although the young company that plays at the comparatively humble City Center for Music and Drama on West 55th Street has been a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Scala and perhaps other European companies for short seasons here appear to be both possible and likely ; indeed , such trips are spoken of quite openly by Metropolitan officials . . . under certain conditions . One high executive of the Met puts it this way : " Sure , we 'd like to have other opera companies come over here to play . We 'd like to have a visit from La Scala , and we 'd like them to play at our house in Lincoln Center . But we want them to come after our season . And we want them to come with co-ordination and planning , not only on timing but on repertoire . " Let 's say we 're putting on our new production of Turandot . How would it be if La Scala came over a month before and put on their Turandot ? and with the same singers in the leading roles ? A conflict like that could be disastrous ? that 's why we want to proceed on a co-ordinated basis . " To help avoid such disastrous ? or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost to assure that when it moves into Lincoln Center its old house will be demolished ? without any loophole to permit its preservation , in the manner of Carnegie Hall . Last March 7 , a long-term lease was announced whereby the old Met site will be turned over to developers who are to begin demolition work for an office structure immediately after the Met moves out . Payments to the Met will begin at $200,000 and increase gradually over the years , but the purpose is not exclusively economic . The unexpected preservation of Carnegie Hall was a shock to the Center 's planners , and they dread even more the prospect of a Save-the-Met campaign developing in the three years that remain to the old house under present schedules . Nothing better symbolizes the Metropolitan Opera 's unchanging artistic outlook than its plan to carry over to Lincoln Center ? in a cultural landmark " that will stand for more than a hundred years " ? the traditional architectural pattern , that acme of opulent ill-design , the nineteenth-century grand-opera house . The plans of the new Met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-displayed boxes , and tiers of balconies in the old-fashioned horseshoe shape . To be sure , the Met is taking care to modify its horseshoe so as to permit its side-seat patrons the novelty of an unobstructed view of the stage . But at Lincoln Center , no less than on 39th Street , the orientation of the Metropolitan Opera will continue to be moretoward the nineteenth century than the twenty-first . Its conduct of its labor negotiations last summer , when the fate of the 1961-62 season was at stake , did nothing to dispel doubts either as to its modernity of viewpoint or its sense of responsibility to the nation 's musical public . Nor are its prices expected to undergo any reversal in their steadily upward course since the war . The Met 's top last season was ten dollars and , although not yet publicly announced , an increase is anticipated with the beginning of the 1962-63 season . Whatever price scale is finally set for the new Metropolitan at Lincoln Center , it 's obvious that opera-going there will be a more costly undertaking than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubly important because it is bound to have a magnetic effect upon admission fees in other theatres at the Center . And while the Met 's audience , however it may grumble , can and undoubtedly will pay increased prices , the faithful customers of the New York City Center very possibly ca n't and wo n't . GI VE UP A DOLLAR A YEA R ? T H E question of the City Center 's relationship to Lincoln Center is one of the most intriguing aspects of the entire project , and one which is still far from being resolved . The New York City Center was founded less than twenty years ago in the administration of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia as a kind of experiment in municipally sponsored culture . Today the New York City Ballet , run by Lincoln Kirstein and George Balanchine , is commonly regarded as the finest of American dance companies , and the New York City Opera has brought a fresh , imaginative , and generally successful approach to lyric drama . The City Center also puts on seasons of drama , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And not least of its contributions to New York life is its availability to visiting dramatic companies such as the Com ? die-Francaise , the Kabuki Theatre of Japan , the Deutsche Schauspielhaus , and others . The City Center is unique in New York not only for its variety but for its low admission charges . At all times , the best seat in the house costs $3.95 , making it ? as it has no hesitation in mentioning in its advertisements ? the city 's biggest entertainment bargain . In part this low price scale is clue to the nominal one-dollar-ayear rental charged by the city for the use of a cavernous , reconverted Masonic Temple on West 92 LINCOLN CENTER 55th Street , which was municipally acquired for nonpayment of taxes in the 1930s . But essentially the $3.95 top reflects the size of the theatre which , barn-like as it . is , has 3.000 seats , nearly all of which , like those of Lewisohn Stadium , are usually covered with people . When Lincoln Center was first being planned , a good deal of hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Center should participate in the new enterprise . It is no secret that while some Metropolitan Opera authorities were willing and even eager to have the New York City Ballet come to Lincoln Center , they wanted no part of the New York City Opera , with its vastly lower prices and its not inconsiderable artistic achievements . However , the City Center 's directors made it plain that the ballet and opera wings of the institution would continue together , come what might . In April of 1961 it was revealed that the Met 's board of directors ? which evidently had veto power in the matter ? had " voted unanimously " to withdraw its objections to the City Center 's participation , and had consented to extend an invitation . As of now , that invitation has been neither declined nor accepted by City Center . The position of Lincoln Center today is that " it is hoped " City Center will participate . The position of the City Center , as expressed by its chairman of the board , Newbold Morris , is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can " afford to " financially , and that in the meantime , " we 're happy where we are . " SEATS FOR THE FAITHFUL AM 0 V E by City Center to Lincoln Center is not a simple matter of packing up its belongings and shifting to new and more elegant quarters . The theatre tabbed for the use of the City Center is the 2,700-seat Dance and Operetta Theatre , which bears the official name of the New York State Theatre . It will be paid for by the state government , and will be operated , for its first year at least , in conjunction with the New York World 's Fair . From the City Center 's standpoint there are at least two things wrong with it . One is that its capacity is 300 under that of Mecca Temple , its present home . The other is that its rental costs will run far higher than the present token fee . As it is , the City Center is not making money . Its total operating loss in the 1960-61 season ? one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artistically ? was $200,000 , of which $165,000 was made up by contributions Fromfoundations and individuals . The Center 's officers passed the hat among its friends to get the rest . Iii the Dance-Operetta Theatre it is doubtful that the City Center would be able to main-Lain the $1.95 to $3.95 price structure which is the hallmark of its service . The Dance-Operetta Theatre is regarded by some as a kind of miniature Paris Opera in design . But it 's an open question how well this horseshoe-tiered , garnet-red-and-white auditorium will serve the needs of the City Center and its audience . Aside from the subtle but not necessarily inconsequential effect that a change to lavish surroundings might have on a theatre that has thrived by making a virtue of adversity , there is the very real and urgent question of what a drop in seating capacity might mean both in audience response and price scale . In defense of their decision to limit the Dance-Operetta Theatre to its present size , Lincoln Center authorities assert that modern building codes would require such an extensive structure for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also that the present City Center Building is filled to capacity only over weekends and during holidays , such as Christmas week , when twice-daily audiences of school children jam the hail for Balanchine 's incomparable production of Tchaikovsky 's Nutcracker. * But it 's not difficult to find City Center customers who will argue that in a $140-million project it should be possible to build a ballet-operetta theatre at least as commodious as the one in use now . As for the argument that the City Center is usually filled to capacity only weekends and holidays , one large hail advocate commented sourly , " So is Yankee Stadium . " So the City Center is in a dilemma . If it goes into Lincoln Center it will find its costs up , its audiences down , and its price structure endangered ? it may have gained a whole world of marble and glass only to lose its artistic soul . And Lincoln Center is in a dilemma , too , for if it leaves out City Center it will not only have to find another resident ballet company for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artistic stimulation and audience loyalty of New York City 's one truly popular theatre of music and ballet . *Actually the capacity of the Dance-Operetta Theatre has risen steadily , according to the architect , " in answer to popular clamor and newspaper editorials . " Lincoln Center 's Original announcement gave it as 2,000 , which was subsequently raised to 2,500 . Final plans put it at 2,700 with 100 additional seats available in the absence of a pit-orchestra ? i.e. , for events other than ballet or operetta . The City Center 's proposed new home , like that of the Metropolitan Opera , so far exists only on paper . But the New York Philharmonic 's , a S14,500,000 auditorium , is actually under construction , with its opening set for next year . Despite the impossibility at this late date of further changes in Philharmonic Hall 's design , its history is nevertheless instructive as to the peculiar outlook of its planners ? aside from the irony of their original rush to build a new home while their old one was waiting to be saved all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the premise that assuming Carnegie Hall was doomed , New York City 's need was for a concert hall where the largest possible audience could comfortably listen to symphonic music ? an auditorium at least as large as Carnegie , with its 2,760 seats . Instead , they conceived the notion of a hall that would be " the finest musical instrument in America , " a hall , in other words , with acoustics as perfect as possible . In this hall there would be room for only 2,500 seats-2,400 when the stage was enlarged to accommodate a chorus . When criticism was voiced of this arrangement on the grounds that acoustics is among the most inexact of sciences , that Carnegie Hall with 260 seats more is widely admired for its sound , and that New York 's need , at a time when Leonard Bernstein 's Philharmonic concerts were drawing capacity crowds , was for a larger rather than a smaller hall , the Center 's officials replied with public pronouncements that " the biggest is not necessarily the best " and " there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost at the moment concrete was being poured for the foundations , to squeeze in one hundred extra seats by adding two rows to the auditorium . Important elements of New York 's musical community are unhappy over Philharmonic Hall 's 2,600 capacity , feeling that the audience , rather than acoustics , should have been the starting point in the planning , and that it never was necessary , in any case , to sacrifice the interests of one to the other . SAME SORT OF PEOPLE T H E decisions that have shaped Lincoln Center have been those of a board of directors headed by John D. Rockefeller 3rd and made up predominantly of successful business executives known for their interest in the arts . They are the same sort of people who run the Metropolitan Opera and the Philharmonic ; indeed , they are in several instances the same people . Of the thirteen-member board listed in the Center 's progress report of June 1959 , four were directors of the Met and two of the Philharmonic. * The board has subsequently been expanded to a membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York World 's Fair ; Harry Van Arsdale , Jr. , president of the New York City Central Labor Council , who will represent organized labor ; and General Maxwell D. Taylor , former Army Chief of Staff , who was appointed President of the Center in January 1961 , but resigned in June to become President Kennedy 's military adviser . Besides the advice of its architects , acoustical experts , construction engineers , etc. , the hoard has available to it the artistic counsel of a group known as the Lincoln Center Council , which consists of the operating heads of the various constituents ? Rudolf Ring , general manager of the Met ; George E. Judd , jr. , managing director of the * The thirteen were : Frank Altschul. chairman of the hoard of General American Investors Company , Inc .

Keiser. chairman of the board of the Cuban-American Sugar Company ; president of the New York Philharmonic ; trustee of the Juilliard Musical Foundation ; director of Juilliard School of Music Rev. Laurence J. McGinley , S.J. , president of Fordham University Irving S. Olds , member of the law firm of White &; Case : director of the Metropolitan Opera Association ; trustee of the New York Public Library John D. Rockefeller 3rd , chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation Charles M. Spofford , member of the law firm of Davis , Polk , Wardwell , Sunderland , and Kiendl ; chairman of the executive committee of the Metropolitan Opera Association ; trustee of the Juilliard Musical Foundation ; director of Milliard School of Music George D. Stoddard , dean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Shakespeare Festival Theatre and Academy Philharmonic ( until his death this summer ) ; William Schuman , president of Juilliard ; Robert Whitehead , producing director of the Repertory Theatre , and Reginald Allen , representing the Center itself . The council 's role , although it may grow in importance once actual operations begin , is purely advisory . Although the Center is devoted to the performing arts , there are neither performers nor artists on the board of directors . The closest approximation was Lincoln Kirstein , managing director of the New York City Ballet , who was in the original list of Board members announced in September 1957 . Kirstein , however , resigned in May 1959 , an action which was not widely publicized at the time . He has since made it known that he felt there was little interest in the ballet as such , that he was unhappy over the dance theatre as finally approved , and that even more basically there was " neither principle nor policy nor patronage for the arts " at Lincoln Center . COME EARLY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Lincoln Center 's directors , and those of the institutions committed to it , express confidence in the way it is progressing and in its effect upon the cultural life of the city and the country . Advertisements appealing to the public for funds continue to stress such supposedly mass-level attractions as Philharmonic Hall 's " 5,498-pipe organ that will take more than a year to build , and five months to install " and its removable floor enabling cak tables and chairs to be installed for summer " pops " concerts . The Center , they say , " is going to be great theatre , great music ? and great fun " ? italics theirs . Arrangements will be made for guided tours of the premises , and an agreement to co-operate has been reached with the New York World 's Fair , which is scheduled to open the same year that the Center reaches full operations , 1964 . In the Center 's brochures , emphasis is placed upon the promenades , the plazas , the facades , and the lobbies ? one of which , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a banquet room and reception ball for civic functions . Prospective contributors are invited to " picture the Philharmonic audience of the future strolling ? utcloors from the orchestra level to view the surrounding gaiety of illuminated trees , fountains , and sculpture , joining thousands of other music and theatre lovers attending performances in other Lincoln Center halls . " The purpose of some of these amenities is not entirely decorative , for they are also intended to minimize the transportation problem that is going to be created when thousands of music and theatre lovers pour out into the night at the same time . Lincoln Center will have an underground garage for eight hundred cars , but it is served by only one subway line as against a multiplicity accessible to Carnegie Hall and the present Metropolitan Opera House . What the Center wishes to do is to make its grounds and extra-theatrical facilities so attractive that departing audiences will be tempted to linger . " We hope to attract people early with our dining facilities , " says Mr. Allen , " and to keep them late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple comes out of the show and runs for a taxi . We are seeking a gracious approach to the arts . " But with its major orchestra playing in the smallest auditorium it has had in seventy years , with its most popular ballet company an uncertain and perhaps unwilling participant , with no room for a Bolshoi Ballet or a La Scala Opera except during the traditionally worst months of the year , New York can perhaps wonder , What price graciousness ? For while there can be little doubt that the city is adding a striking and shining architectural complex to its skyline , there is much less certainty that it is increasing its capacity to bring art closer to the people , or the people closer to art . After all , the usefulness of Lincoln Center will be determined not by how many people conic for guided tours through its edifices , but how many come to hear , see , and participate in the artistic experiences it offers . In a purely physical way , Lincoln Center has already done much to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An unsightly , unhealthy slum area between West 62nd and 66th Streets is gone . Better homes have been found for 1,647 families in the neighborhood . Impetus has been given to improvement plans for the entire West Side . All this was accomplished eighteen months ahead of schedule . As a real-estate project , Lincoln Center is already a magnificent success . Yet the challenges it must answer and the needs it must serve are basically artistic . And in this realm , Lincoln Center , as it is currently being designed and developed , shows signs of replacing old problems with new and , when it is finished , of leaving the artistic life of New York ornamented but not enriched . And if it does only this , can it fairly be said to have accomplished its promise of becoming ? in its own words ? " a seed-bed of artistic progress " and a " picture of America 's cultural maturity " ?
