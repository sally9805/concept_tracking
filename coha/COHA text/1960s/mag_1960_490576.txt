Notes and Comment ON the general subject of inane grins , and especially the inane grins one finds on the front pages of newspapers , we intend to have a few words to say from time to time in this space . The inane grins are likely to increase in frequency and decrease in spontaneity as 1960 grows older . As we indicated a few weeks ago , we have done some research on the matter . The phenomenon has been studied from a number of angles . There is more to it than a mere counting of the num- ? bet of teeth shown by politicians , statesmen , and ex-statesmen on the front pages of the local newspapers in any one year . This approach will he continued , of course , in 1960 . This week we only want to point out to those unfamiliar with newspaper photographers that they make a considerable effort to catch political figures when they are not grinning or smiling . A press photographer we often collaborated with in the nineteen-twenties told us in Washington the other day that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not smiling than it was during the Coolidge administration . Coo .. lidge , he says , always tried to smile at press photographers but did n't always succeed . Today , he says , it is a rare feat for a photographer to catch one who is only smiling . Most , he says , grin . Frequently , they chuckle or guffaw . To catch one with a straight face , he says , is virtually impossible . He covers the ' White House these days , and has done so Enr some years . President Eisenhower , he says , does n't invariably flash a grin when he sees a press photographer , but he usually does . He says the President usually does that when he sees anybody , no matter who . But the President is n't running for office . Neither is Truman . Neither is Hoover . We will be chiefly interested from now on in the men who are . This White House photographer says that all the Republican candidates grin more or less automatically at the sight of a flash bulb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a flash bulb somewhere near them , he says . Other photographers , who encounter the Democratic candidates as well as the Republican candidates , tell us this is true of all of them . Using all sorts of devices , we have been told , they try to creep up on candidates of both parties and catch them looking solemn . No soap . Such a photograph would be a novelty , they say , and might he worth a lot of money someday . 1 , Ve believe ever ) , word they say . They are a dependable and hardworking group . We knew Wendell Wi1.11cie a good while before he became a candidate . The acquaintanceship had nothing whatever to do with politics . He was a dependable and hardworking man . He did n't grill much , and he smiled less frequently than many men with more on their minds than he had . After he became a candidate for the Presidency , we happened to be in his company  --  just the two of us  --  when he was crossing a hotel lobby here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight face about something he considered of national , if not international , significance , Then he caught sight of a press photographer . He lit up like a Christmas tree . This was in the late summer of 1940 . Christmas wasmontbs behind him or months ahead of him , depending on how you look at it . In any event , the photographer was n't trying to photograph Willkie . The photographer was looking for somebody else . He had n't seen Willkie . He never did see Willkie . But it was plain to us that Willkie had become a changed man . He had acquired a reflex . We make no predictions , but it would n't surprise us if victory in November goes to the candidate who learns sorriehow to stop smiling and grinning at press photographers or who at least learns to limit his show of public jovialiq to occasions on which there is an evident reason for it  --  a reason that can be clearly and briefly explained in a newspaper . caption . Most of the time , there is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caption writers would find that too long and too dull to go into . Meanwhile , we congratulate the press  --  especially the Times , which won our 1959 prize for showing the greatest number of celebrated public teeth on a single front page . We hope the papers continue to print what the press photographers bring in day after day . These photographs represent an honest record . One may find them unpalatable to look at before breakfast . If so , one can put off looking at them until after lunch . The thing we all have to do is to get to know everything we can about the candidates for the nominations . " One may smile , and snide , and be a villain " is what Shakespeare wrote on the subject , circa 1601 . Plishker 's Folly THIS is notoriously the heyday of the object designed to have not the most efficient shape possible but the shape most likely to catch the eye of the consumer . According to the principle that governs the hardboiled world of retail merchandising , form does n't follow function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , In the rare cases in which this principle has been ignored  --  for example , in the case of electric-light bulbs , which through the years have nearly always been allowed to take whatever shape was appropriate to their manufacture and operation  --  the merchandising people have felt thoroughly frustrated . One merchandising man who has long chafed at the logical but unidentifiable , and therefore practically un-American , shape of light bulbs is Mr Herbert Plishkcr , merchandise manager of the Lamp Division of Westinghous.e . It has piqued poor Plishker that light bulbs have been bought indiscriminately , with little attention to brand names . Shoppers stocking up on bulbs have confessed , under close questioning , that they did n't know whether the bulbs they were buying had been made by Westinghouse or G.E . I An intolerable situation , and one that Pfishker set about remedying some time ago . The first Plishker ploy was the launching , in 1956 , of pastel-tinted Beauty Tone light bulbs , calculated in part to flatter the complexion and in part to distinguish a Westinghouse bulb from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly successful , Plishker , who is known tce his office associates by the affectionate sobriquet of " the mad inventor , " decided to go a step further and create an entirely new shape for the Westinghouse bulb . But let Plishkcr speak for himself : " It has always been an ironic fact to those of us who are in the electric-light-bulb industry and who care deeply for that industry that in comic books and similar graphic outlets the light bulb has traditionally served as the symbol of a bright idea , Ha ! Probably no other consumer item in history has undergone so little change . ' Why , the whole concept of light bulbs has remained virtually stagnant for over a quarter of a century ! More than a billion light bulbs a year are sold in this country , yet the average person fails to notice the slightest difference between brands . And no wonder , because there has n't been any difference , The industry has been dominated by the image of the teardrop ; it has simply failed to imagine any other shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahout imagining dozens of odd , purposely unfunctional shapes , and at last he hit upon the squarish demi-dumbbell that Westinghouse describes in advertisements as " The Shape of Tomorrow " and that is used for a bulb bearing the forbidding official name of " All New Eye Saving White Bulb . " He has admitted that Westinghouse engineers looked askance at Isis project , arguing , in their stuffy , old-fashioned way , that there was no point in chang big the shape of a bulb unless the change reflected a substantial improvement in function . " I knew better , " he says . " Change merely for the sake of change is always of great psychological importance from the consumer 's point of view . Luckily , our general manager had worked in TV and understood the emotional implications of the new shape . At first , people went around the office calling the bulb Plishker 's Folly , but I 'm getting the last laugh . The public 's response has gone far beyond our wildest dreams . I ca n't give you the exact figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but I can tell you that we sold four times as many white square bulbs in the first ten months of last year as we sold white teardrop bulbs in the whole of 1958 . " To Mr. Plishker 's astonishment and delight , and surely to the discomfiture of the Westinghouse engineers , the new bulb has turned out to have certain advantages . For one thing , it 's easier to insert in sockets than the slippery old teardrop bulk , especially in the dark ; for another , its surface area is slightly larger than its predecessor 's , with the result that it diffuses more light and yet gives off less heat ; and , for a third , it collects over five per cent less dust . How Westinghouse and the mad inventor arrived at this particular statistic we have no idea and would n't dream of asking . It is enough that a man should design a perfectly ridiculous new shape and be able to boast that it 's also , by accident , more efficient . Why snoop around for proof ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow is brighter , cooler , cleaner , and easier to handle than the Shape of Yesterday . The Six Watches ANEW YORK . grandmother who travels widely in the summer bought six watches in Zurich last August for her six grandchildren here . She turned the watches over to them at Christmastime , each with a name engraved on its back . All went well , or so she presumed . But last month , one by one , five of the watches were turned back to her , for one reason or another . Remembering what a nice man the watchmaker in Zurich had been  --  he was at the Wapcx A.G. establishment , in the Talstrasse  --  she wrapped the five watches up and mailed them to him , asking him to do what he could with them and then return them to her by mail , along with his hill for repairs . The watches are undergoing overhaul in Zurich now , and she expects to receive them soon , for she got a letter just the other day from the watchmaker , reading as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches and we take care of them of course . But we want to tell you that the watch for Peter is O.K. Nothing is wrong with . Now , the watch for a child ( Ellen ) : the watch runs good , only what happened with the glass ? Did the child put the watch on a hot object ? Thomas is right . His watch lost a little screw , which fixed the movement . We drived home and the watch goes very good . The alarm watch for Lewis ! The watch runs , but the alarm is not good . Please explain him how to hand it . It is our believe that the person always took out the button too hard . But anyway it should not happen . We will repair it too . And that watch for Andy . With whii.h instrument ( lid he try to put down the bottoms ? Does he not know that he has to push twice to make going back the second hand wheel ? Please explain it to him . Otherways his watch runs never . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little machine which , .. ? ? ants to be treated carefully . Not with knifes and so on . You will get the watches soon and we hope you will like them again . Very truly yours , W APEX A.G. Talstrasse 39 , Zurich . Leterman Revisited HO UL I ) old acquaintance be for-kJ got ? Perish the thought , and hark to a report on Mr. Elmer G. Leterman , the master insurance salesman , whom we recently rebuttonbeled after a lapse of twenty years . We use this verb in a metaphorical sense , since Mr. Leterman 's lapels , unnotched and only an inch wide , have no buttonholes . When we joined him at The Four Seasons restaurant for lunch , he was wearing a gray suit , a narrow tic of light-gray silk , ruby cuff links , a ruby tic clip , and gray alligator-skin shoes . " I design my clothes myself , " he said . " They 've been very helpful to me in my work . They get me in places . They give me a curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons on the sleeves , no cuffs on the trousers . I handle group insurance for the Corset &; Brassiere Association of America , the National Knitted Outerwear Association , the National Shoe Retailers Association , and the New York Clothing Manufacturers Exchange , and I think that my clothing-industry clients like to see my lapels . I 'm the only person in New York with no outside pockets who wears a in around his hat at all times . I have a dozen fedoras with Iris , some of them made of the neck feathers of a hundred pheasants . When I see another man with a tri around his hat , I go up to him and say ' Aloha ! ' I met Henry Kaiser that way at an air-pi rrt . " Mr. Leterman , who was forty-two when we last encountered him , is still full of bounce as well as business , and still full of enthusiasm for Hawaii , which he visited last year for the twenty - fourth time . " I 've been made Honorary Life Mayor of Honolulu , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , I 'm thrilled to death to be anything that is the only one . Naturally , I have a certificate . C insure The Four Seasons  --  or , rather , the company that owns it and several other restaurants  --  for one hundred thousand dollars , and I lunch here every day . I used to lunch at a big round table at the Algonquin with Louis Nizer , Ben Bodne , Konrad Hercovici , and some others , and I miss it , but The Fnur Seasons is a terrific showcase to take clients and prospective clients to . I never talk insurance unless my companion does first . One day , I 'm waiting for a cab outside my office in Rockefeller Center , it 's raining , and out of the building steps this beautiful Jinx Falkenherg , looking for a cab . Tex comes down , we all take a cab together , Jinx mentions insurance , and by the time I 've dropped them off at Sixty-first Street , I 've insured Tex for a hundred thousand dollars . If only we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonnenberg told me he did n't think he could get any more insurance , because he was overweight , and I got him a hundred thousand dollars . How ? I sent him to a fat doctor ! " This resourceful man smiled , and advised us that last summer he took in a young lawyer , Norman N. Gortz , as an equal partner , and that his firm is now known as the Leterman-Gortz Corporation . " I 've produced three hooks in the last six years , " he said . " ' The Sale Begins When the Customer Says No , ' which was written by a ghostwriter  --  I forget his name  --  and Personal Power Through Creative Selling ' and ' The New Art of Selling , ' both of which I wrote with help from my staff and suggestions from such friends as Lou Nizer and Milton Biow . These two have been translated into French , German , Italian , Spanish , Swedish , and Japanese . ' Personal Power ' has sold over twenty thousand copies in West Germany under the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fallen Nicht vain Himmel . ' I 'm about to have ' The New Art ' translated into four different Indian languages and published in India . Harper 's brought it out here , and Bantam Books has just sold out a first printing of a hundred thousand copies . Take a look at these . " Leterman pulled a raft of fan letters from an inside coat pocket , which we gathered was commodious , and we noted among their enthusiastic signers Norman Vincent Peale , Nathan Ohrbach , Elmo Roper , and Dorothy Draper . " Is n't that a beautiful letter ? " he said of one . " Does n't he write beautiful ? I feel the good Lord gives me ideas that I can put down in book Form . I went to Europe for the first time in 1952 , and a year or so ago to the Far East , where I distributed a few cards , " He handed us a couple , printed in Japanese , which he told us read , " Elmer G. Leterman Says , ' I Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Away My New Car , ' " and " Elmer G. Leterman Says , ' The Easiest Way to Make Ends Meet Is to Get Off Your Own . ' " Then he gave us one in Eng lish , which read , " It 's NICE to Be Important . It 's More Important to he NICE . " We told him we agreed . Mixed ANOTHER account of an experience with an electric mixer has reached us . " Electric mixers arc wonderful for making a pat6 , " a lady who is rather a gourmet informed us , " but the recipes in the electric-mixer cookbook are a bit primitive . I decided to doctor up the basic recipe anti make something really special . I started with some leftover veal . I added garlic , shallots , stock , white wine , and all the interesting spices I could think of . It came along beautifully , and I put the p  --  t ? aside to cool , confident it would he a triumph . I took my first taste with high anticipation .

We were bound for Calcutta , With a load of Irish butter , When the wind began to blow us out to sea . Then up spoke Jack , who was a jolly old sailor . " At this point , we suggested that he take joll ) old Jack to some more appropriate haven , and inquired as to the source of his nautical mood . " The Motor Boat Show , at the Coliseum , " he said .
