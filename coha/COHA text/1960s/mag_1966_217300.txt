The scene in the Great Kremlin Palace amounted to an anticlimax before the show had even begun . On the rostrum before 1,517 obedient delegates to the Supreme Soviet , Russia 's puppet parliament , Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Aleksei Kosygin huddled and chatted with studied amiability . Then Brezhnev rose and nominated Kosygin for another term . <P> Thus was dissipated a wave of speculation about the possible retirement of the dry , dour Kosygin , regarded as a leading exponent of reform at home and restraint abroad . In recent months , Kremlinologists have professed to divine signs that the 62-year-old Premier might be in failing health and weary of the job . Instead , Kosygin was unanimously re-elected by the delegates on the first day , along with some of the other members of the collective leadership that took over from Nikita Khrushchev almost two years ago : among them President Nikolai Podgorny and First Deputy Premiers Kyrill Mazurov and Dmitry Poliansky . <P> Delay &; " Democracy . " Nor was there any hint of change in Soviet policies . The session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " democratized " by increasing the number of the Supreme Soviet 's standing committees from three to nine-which in substance meant nothing . Kosygin revealed no fresh policy to cope with Russia 's lagging economy ; instead , he disclosed that the new five-year plan , scheduled to have gone into effect last January , was still not ready , possibly because of wrangles over a new pricing structure designed to permit limited fluctuation in response to supply and demand , and to provide salary incentives for better work . It has long been suspected that old-style planners have been dragging their feet on Libermanism , and Kosygin confirmed it . Criticizing " a certain conservatism " by some officials , the Premier declared : " The new wholesale prices are to insure such conditions under which every normally operating enterprise will be able to develop on the basis of full self-accounting . " <P> Hot Hands . On Viet Nam , the Kremlin leader boasted that Russia " is rendering the gallant Vietnamese people steadily increasing economic and military , material and moral support , " ritually vowed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help drive out the American invaders . " But Kosygin added that Russia stands ready to " traverse our part of the road toward mutual understanding " and " will not be taken in by the provocations of those who would like to warm their hands over the hot beds of international tension " - which seemed aimed less at the U.S. than at Red China .
