txt Giovanni Martinelli , for many years the Metropolitan Opera 's leading dramatic tenor , and one of the last to carry on the ebullient tradition of Enrico Caruso , died at Roosevelt Hospital early yesterday . He was 83 years old . The world famous performer rose from rural choir ? boy , squeaked through a nearly ruinous audition with Arturo Toscanini , ' and went on to compile a record that few in opera have equaled . His name was legendary in the famous opera house when he retired in 1946 to become a voice coach . His death , at 5:30 A.M. , was attributed to a circulatory ailment occurring after a sudden illness . In recent years he had lived at the Buckingham Hotel , 101 West 57th Street . Mr. Martinelli 's singing career began lightly with overheard hijinks in the Italian army and ranged vigorously and jriumphantly through 33 years , with the Metropolitan Opera , cresting in a supreme , nearly indestructible ? tenor whom Caruso called his " Crown Prince ? ' It was a musical career un-11 flaggingly accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the shock of , flowing gray hair that Mr. Mar-1 tinelli referred to ? with char-1 acteristic flair ? as " platinum blond . " His record has few equals in American operatic annals . One of his major accomplishments was the enormously difficult title role of Verdi 's " Otello " ? described as the crown of his jubilee year in the United States , the 1938-39 Mct season . He sang the role four times that season . " On the stage , " Howard Taubman of The New York Times wrote , " there is no suggestion in the fresh voice that its possessor was 52 on Oct. 22 . The tenor 's face is unlined and his eyes are bright . If he has a little girth , tenors of all ages and in all climates have tended toward corpulence . " It , was , Mr. Taubman wrote , the tenor 's famous temperament , " as sunny as his native Italy , " that commended him to friends and colleagues . And it was his temperament that rescued him , in the formative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Toscanini . Mr. Martinelli had been before the public for less than six months , and had sung in just three operas , when he was engaged to sing in Puccini 's " The Girl of the Golden West " in Rome . Vetoed on First Notes When he began to sing at the first rehearsal , Toscanini glared at him , muttered something and finally banged the score ' shut ... " It is impossible , " the maestro told the young tenor : " You will not do ! " " Very well , " the 24-year-old from the provinces replied cheerfully to the angry maestro. least I can say that I have been in Rome and that I have worked with Toscanini . " The ' maestro ? looked up in surprise . Then he smiled . " Let us try again , " he said , " Per haps we can do something . " Mr. Martinelli sang in " The Girl of the Golden West " with success ? in Rome , and was then engaged to sing in the opera in various cities throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repertory of 57 roles , the tenor had thoroughly justified the maestro 's indulgence . He had made his debut at the Metropolitan on Nov. 20 , 1513 , when Caruso was in the ascendant . Mr. Martinelli had then a repertory of perhaps seven opera parts ? all roles that rthe incomparable Caruso sang . Many- tenors were called to the Met in those years , but no others were ' chosen to stay . Only , iMr . Martinelli survived the days of Caruso 's glory and emerged as an artist and personality in his own right . The ' auguries for such a fu ture-were ' only dimly visible in his boyhood . Giovanni Martinelli was born in Montagnana , ? taly , a little town ? in the province of Padua , on Oat. 22 , 1885 . His father , Antonino , was a cabinetmaker . At the age of 20 he went into The New York Times Giovanni Martinelli the army , as all Italian youths had to do , and found a soft job as a member of a regimental band , escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Saturday evening he and a friend rigged a French horn through a window and pretended they were playing a phonograph . Mr. Martinelli sang , while the friend played a mandolin accompaniment . " The next day , " Mr. Martinelli later recalled , " the bandmaster , a little man with a rough voice and a martinet 's glare , demanded to know who had sung the previous evening . " I feared that I would be punished for disturbing the peace , and hesitated to confess . When I. did confess . I learned that a singing teacher of the town had passed by that evening , and had been impressed by my voice . " The teacher gave the youngster an audition several days ' later , and told him that he must study . Eventually the young tenor went to Milan , where a group of managers financed him for a period of study . One of the friends he made in this period was Oresto Poli , ? manager of the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan , who was ' responsible for Mr. Martinelli 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ernani , " presented at the 1Teatro in 1910 . The youngster suffered such an acute attack of stage fright that he vowed 1. , e would never sing in an ' opera again . He forgot that vow the next morning . His notices were good , he had been enthusiastically received , and his long career had been launched . He next came to the attention of Giacomo Puccini . That 's how he got to Rome , Toscanini and " The Girl of the Golden West . " Also , it was in Rome that he met Giulio Gatti-Casazza , manager of La Scala in Milan , who was preparing to depart for America to begin his 32-year rule over the Met . In 1913 Mr. Gatti-Cassaza cabled an offer to the young tenor . Mr. Martinelli considered his fortune secure . He married Adele Previtali on Aug. 7 , 1913 , and then set sail for America . His first appearance at the Metropolitan was as Rodolfo in " La Boh ? me , " to Lucrezia Bori 's Mimi . From the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as comparable to that of Caruso , with whom he became fast friends . Among Mr. Martinelli 's most notable ' roles at the Met were Eleazar in " La Juive ; " Radames in " Aida " ; Manrico in " II Trovatore " ; Canio in Pagliacci " ; Cavaradossi in " Tosca " ; Gerald in " Lakme , " and Don Jose in " Carmen . " Of his performance in the title role of " Otello " which opened the season on Nov. 21 , 1938 , at the Met , Olin Downes wrote in The Times : " . .. Mr. Martinelli 's Otello was sung with the art of the veteran that he is , interpreted with a conviction , a nobility and pathos that wrung the heart . For this stands s-today as one of the finest impersonations that ? the Metropolitan stage ' now knows . " Mr. Martinelli , by carefully contrived proportion , nuance and thoughtfully prepared climax , made every moment of his presence on the stage significant , and , as before , delivered the great monologue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elemental nature riven with despair , that the audience interrupted the opera with applause . " His voice could justly be described as one of the glories of Italy , It was a " tenore di forza , " a tenor of unusual brillance , power and size . His singing method was unconventional , and he appeared to squeeze notes from his throat . For years there were gloomybredictions that anybody who sang this way would necessarily have a short career . Yet Mr. Martinelli went on , as brilliantly as ever , His appetites were lusty , and once in his career they led him to disaster . This was during a broadcast matinee of " Aida " in the late nineteen-thirties . Mr. Martinelli had had a surfeit of lobster the evening before , and reported to the opera house ill . He managed to struggle through the first aria , " Celeste Aida , " and then collapsed . It was one of the few times in Metropolitan Opera history that the curtain had to be brought down during a performance .

The program was devoted to music from , operas in which he had sung with the company , - and he was presented with a leatherbound , gold-stamped album containing programs for each of the 36 roles he had Sung for the Met . Four years Tater , in February , 1967 , Mr. Martinelli was suddenly pressed into service once more . He was in Seattle to give a lecture l when a member of the local opera company 's " Turandot " cast came down with laryngitis . Donning a false beard and the robe and miter of a Chinese emperor for his first opera- role since 1950 , Mr. Martinelli received a splendid reception .
