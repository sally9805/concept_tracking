No single event better illustrated the pre-eminence of the pitcher throughout the 1968 baseball season than the July All-Star game . The best batsmen in both leagues struck out 20 times and collected only eight hits as the National League eked out a soporific 1-0 victory . One disgusted spectator called the game " the biggest bore of my life . " <P> No one was bored by last week 's All-Star game . Held in Washington 's new Robert F. Kennedy Stadium , the contest clearly reflected the re-emergence of the crowd-pleasing " long ball . " In the second inning , Cincinnati 's Johnny Bench blasted a two-run homer off the New York Yankees ' Mel Stottlemyre , who was ultimately tagged with the loss . Washington 's Frank Howard sent a towering drive over the centerfield fence in the American League 's half of the inning . Then the Nationals sent nine men to the plate and scored five runs as San Francisco 's Willie McCovey belted the first of two home runs . Even St. Louis Pitcher Steve Carlton , the game 's eventual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freehan came back with a homer , but that still left the Americans on the short end of an 8-2 score . <P> American League Manager Mayo Smith of Detroit then rushed in the ace of his own mound staff , Denny McLain . The Tiger righthander had flown home in his personal Lear jet to have his deteriorating teeth examined , returned just in time to dress and warm up for the fourth inning . McCovey greeted McLain by rapping his third pitch over the rightfield fence for the fifth home run of the game . <P> There might have been a sixth but for Boston Leftfielder Carl Yastrzemski , who robbed Bench of his second homer with a leaping catch against the fence . <P> After that , Cleveland 's Sam McDowell and Boston 's Ray Culp combined to retire the next nine Nationals in a row . But the damage had already been done . The National League wound up with a 9-3 victory , its seventh straight in the series . <P> The real winners were the batsmen of both leagues , who collected 17 hits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season 's narrowed strike zone and lowered mounds have restored the balance between hitters and pitchers.
