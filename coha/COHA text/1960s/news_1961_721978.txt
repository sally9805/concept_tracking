txt President Kennedy disclosed today that he had made an agreement that Vice Presient Johnson would exercise the rights and duties of the President in the event of any period of Presidential incapacity . The agreement follows the example set by President Eisenhower and Vice President Nixon in 1958 . Their agreement was a product of concern generated by General Eisenhower 's several illnesses . President Kennedy made his disclosure in response to a question at his news conference , today . Question 4 , Page 6 . Pierre Salinger , the President 's press secretary , said later that Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Johnson had reached their agreement , similar to the Eisenhower-Nixon accord , prior to Inauguration Day last Jan. 20 . The agreement was subjected to a full study of constitutional questions by the Attorney General . No specific event or ailment led to the agreement , Mr. Salinger said . A forty-three-page opinion by Attorney general Robert F. Kennedy , also released today , endorsed the agreement . The procedures , identical language to those of the Eisenhower-Nixon agreement , are as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President would ? if possible ? so inform the Vice President , and the Vice President would serve as acting President , exercising the powers and duties of the office until the inability had ended . " ( 2 ) In the event of an inability which would prevent the President from so communicating with the Vice President , the Vice President , after such consultation as seems ti him appropriate under the circumstances , would decide upon the devolution of the powers and duties of the office and would serve as acting President until the inability had ended . " ( 3 ) The President , in either event , would determine when the , inability had ended and at that time would resume the full exercise of the powers and duties of the office . " This agreement was extended informally to one additional // point in the White House press statement . Referring to " consul- , Itation " in Point 2 , the statement ' said : " There is no provision of the Constitution or of law prescribing any procedure of consultation , but the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sound judgment , that the Vice President would wish to have the support of the Cabinet as to the necessity and desirability of " discharging the powers and duties of the Presidency as acting President as well as legal advice from the Attorney General that the circumstances would , under the Constitution . justify his doing so . " The understanding between the President and the Vice President authorizes the Vice President to consult . with these officials with a free mind that this is what the President .1-tended in the event of a crisis . " Constitution Not Clear The question of an acting President occurs because the Constitution is not clear about the rights and duties of the Vice President if the President , though living , is unable to function . Article II of the Constitution raises such questions as : " Does the office of President , or only the rights and duties of the office , devolve on the ' Vice President ? " Also , " If the office itself devolved on the Vice President , does that mean he would be President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully recovered ? " Further , " Who shall decide when a President is disabled , or what constitutes disability ? " ' Or , " Who shall decide when a President 's disability has ended and how he shall reclaim his power ? " The Constitution , contrary to popular notion , does not provide beyond . question that upon the death of a President the Vice President becomes President . However , succession to the Presidency , in case of death , resignation or removal , has been established by what scholars call " constitutional custom . " John Tyler established this precedent when William Henry Harrison died in 1841 . The principle laid down by him was followed by six other Vice Presidents upon the death of the President in office . Edward S. Corwin , a recognized authority , says in his book , " The President : Office ard Powers " : " That Tyler was wrong in his reading of the original i ; tention of the Constitution is certain . " It was clearly the intention of the framers , Mr. Corwin wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected President . ' Some Doubts Linger While custom has removed any real doubt about succession , in the event of death , resignation or removal , doubt remains about rights and duties in the , event of a President 's inability , and his subsequent recovery . President Garfield lingered for eighty days after he was shot in 1881 . He was able to : perform only one official act , the signing of an extraditions paper . The Cabinet wanted Vice 1 President Chester A. Arthur to act in Garfield 's place . But there was concern lest the President , should he recover , would have I no way of regaining the powers ' that the Vice President might . have exercised in place of the President . The most serious . period of Presidential disability followed ; the stroke suffered by President Wilson in 1919 . For six weeks , he was unable to act on legislation that Congress sent to him . Effective power devolved on his wife and his physician . The Eisenhower-Nixon agreement and the Kennedy-Johnson agreement appeared to clear up most constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of a President 's mental incompetence . Such a President might fail or refuse to inform his Vice President of his incapacity , or , having done so , might reclaim his powers before he had recovered . On this matter , a highly placed lawyer in the Justice Department said : " Nobody has come up with the ingenuity to answer that one . Obviously there is a possibility of conflict . " Legal Question Remains There is a legal question ' whether the President has the right to make an agreement as to who shall act for him if he is unable to function . The Attorney General 's opinion did not deal directly with the legality of such an agree ' ment . It dealt with the desirability of an agreement , with the Vice President 's powers in certain circumtances , and and who should decide when inability began and ended . The opinion touched peripherally on ? Executive versus Congressional rights in this context . It said : " Persuasive arguments have been raised in opposition to the theory that Congress has the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law a method for deciding such cases . One is that since the Constitution expressly provides in Article II for succession when BOTH the President and Vice President are disabled , it excludes the right of Congress to act in the case of / Presidential inability only . This ' is an application of the familiar maxim in statutory construe-1 tion , inelusio unius , exclusio alterius the inclusion of one is/ the exclusion of others . " It is an argument favored by former Attonreys General Brownell and Rogers , although ' the latter also stressed Prof. ' Arthur E. Sutherland 's Harvard Law School contention that ending the President 's duties by ordinary legislation would run counter to the doctrine of separation of powers ? ? * " Both of my immediate pre- ' decessors were , therefore , strongly opposed to- the legislative or judicial route for resolving the problem . " President Eisenhower , while making an agreement with his Vice President , endorsed at the same time a constitutional 's amendment that would clarify the Vice President 's position if the President could not act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House referred to the agreement as verbal , or oral . It was explained that , although the terms had been put in writing and made public , there was no state document with signature or seal to make it formal . General Eisenhower and Mr. Nixon did not make their agreement formal either .
