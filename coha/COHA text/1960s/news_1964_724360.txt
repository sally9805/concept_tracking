txt The European Economic Community won a race against the clock early today as ministers of the six member nations reached agreement on a common negotiating position for the Kennedy round of tariff discussions . The agreement came after an all-night session of hard bargaining . It had capped four days and nights of wrangling over which of the Common Market 's industrial imports should be excepted from the sweeping tariff cuts that are the goal of the Kennedy round . Some time later today , after a few technical points are cleared up , a courier will fly to Geneva to submit the European Community 's list of proposed exceptions tomorrow . Other Lists to Be Offered The list will be received by officials of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with lists of proposed exceptions prepared by the United States and by other major industrial powers in the non-Communist world . By observing the deadline , the negotiating nations will give great impetus to the trade-expansion effort , which has been virtually stalled since summer . The Kennedy round , named for the late President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress , is widely regarded as the most important liberalization effort in modern history . The act authorizes United States Participation in the negotiations . Big Expansion Foreseen The primary objective is to make simultaneous tariff cuts on all possible industrial products involved in world trade . The reductions are to be reciprocal , with the goal 50 per cent across the board . In previous negotiations the elimination of barriers has been most gradual , with reductions made on a product-by-product basis . Should the across-the-board reductions materialize , they would result in a few years in an expansion of trade that would amount to billions of dollars . Trade officials of West Germany , Italy , France , the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg have been working here in the unofficial capital of the community to condense their separate lists into a single list that will be representative of the bloc . The starting point for this intramural tug of war was a basic list prepared by the Common Market 's . Executive Commission . Of modest proportions , it embraced special imports that added up . to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear tariffs . This would have left 88 per cent of the Common Market 's industrial imports as candidates for the acrossthe-board cuts . However , France , Italy and Belgium offered separate lists of additional exceptions that , if all had been added to the original schedule , would have expanded it to unmanageable proportions . Another consideration that put pressure on the secret bargaining sessions was a realization that nations such as the United States and Britain would submit modest lists . A long  --  corrimunity list would have reflected adversely on the Common Market , and if there is one thing on which the European . Community has prided itself above all others , it has been its liberal approach to internaional trade . The consensus among analysts was that the Economic Community 's list would turn out to be about eight percentage points greater than the list recommended by the Executive Commission . This will mean ex. ceptions embrasing about 20 per cent of imports subject to tariffs . It was felt that this would make the list substantially longer than those of the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rejected by the Ministerial , Council of GATT , under the , auspices of which the Kennedy round is to be held . The Ministerial Council is in Charge of setting up the ground , rules that will govern the tariff-I cutting'procedures . The negotiators are scheduled to get down to business in January . It was generally agreed in ' the GATT Council last spring that only those imports that affected strategic or other vital ' national interests were to be acceptable as exceptions . Experienced observers concurred in the view that while the negotiators on the Kennedy round still had a long , hardl road to climb , the submission of exceptions lists by the chiefll missions would signal that a start had been made . Should the Kennedy round proceed to a successful conclusion , one minister remarked . ' the increase in trade that would result would do more to integrate the economies and , governments of the non-Communist nations than all other alliance plans combined .                    @
