Breakfast cereals used to come in boxes that contained nothing else , bearing a label with directions for cooking . Today , cereals hit the table ready to eat , bite-sized , sugar-toasted , cocoa-flavored or doughnut-shaped ; their sales appeal is gauged less by flavor and nutrition than by the servings of toy automobiles , plastic submarines , code-message rings and baseball cards buried among the flakes or offered on the label . This week . Cereal Giant General Mills moves to serve a better after-breakfast bonus . On 45 million boxes of nine " Big G " cereals . General Mills will offer juvenile crunchers a serious , 48-page " Nature 's Wonderland Stamp Album . " For one boxtop and 30 , a kid can be the first in his neighborhood to study 45 species of wildlife with the aid of fact-crammed texts and sets of six-color stamps to be pasted into the album . <P> " Nature 's Wonderland " is the creation of General Mills ' cereal-marketing manager , Cyril Plattes , 45 . A passionate woodsman who keeps a canoe stashed handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wild , Plattes dreamed of such a book all the time he was stuffing model cars and magic tricks into cereal boxes . " If we 're going to give the kids something , " says he , " let 's give them something to help them rather than , the usual old blah . " Forsaking blah . Plat tes commissioned Dr. Walter J. Breckenridge , director of Minnesota 's Natural History Museum , to compile an illustrated nature book . Breckenridge included pertinent facts about each animal ( horned toads are really lizards ; skunks are ac curate up to 12 ft. ) , tips on such field-trip essentials as avoiding snakebite , and a habitat map of U.S. wildlife . <P> Up to now , General Mills ' hottest box-topper has been a 15 radioactive polonium ring that drew 2,000,000 requests . <P> Hoping that his nature book , which sells at cost , may prove even hotter , Plattes has ordered a first printing of 1,000,000 . <P> If it moves well . General Mills will try other educational offers , may even - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry trend . Says Plattes hopefully : " The adults all seem to like it . The question is : Will the kids ?
