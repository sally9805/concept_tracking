PUBLIC POLICY <P> Banking is one area where Bobby Kennedy 's trustbusters have found the going rough . Legal interpretation has prevented them from blocking bank mergers that the U.S. Comptroller of Currency has approved - and over the years comptrollers have been reason ably permissive about mergers , partly to compensate for the fact that banks are strictly regulated by federal and state agencies . Last week the U.S. Supreme Court , which has been a vigorous trustbuster lately , opened the banks to Bobby . It ruled that the Justice Department may bring unlimited suits against banks under the Clayton Act 's broadly worded and controversial Section Seven , which bans mergers whose effect " may be substantially to lessen competition , or tend to create a monopoly . " Voting 5 to 2 , the court upheld the Justice Department 's protest against the previously approved merger of Philadelphia 's second and third largest banks , Philadelphia National and Girard Trust , which together would control 36% of the city 's banking assets . The Justice Department now hopes to block pending mergers in Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local banking business . It will also try - with some what less chance of success - to dissolve the proposed merger of three Milwaukee banks ( 20% of the city 's assets ) and the recent linkups that created the Continental Illinois National Bank ( with 25.5% of Chicago 's assets ) and Manhattan 's Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ( 13% of New York City 's assets ) . <P> The substantial effect of the court 's decision should be to reduce future attempts to merge by bankers everywhere .
