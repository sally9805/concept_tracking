MOST of the speculative money that flooded into West Germany last week came from a volatile and increasingly powerful segment of the world 's financial apparatus : the Eurodollar market . That market is a curious byproduct of two decades of U.S. balance of payments deficits . Eurodollars are nothing more than U.S. dollars on deposit in private banks abroad . The pool was organized in the late 1950s by London bankers who sensed that if they could marshal the billions of dollars already overseas , they could lend them out at a substantial profit . Business has been brisk ever since . <P> Today the Eurodollar market has expanded into a wholesale operation on a global scale . It involves roughly 500 banks in 40 countries . The banks accept deposits ( minimum : $25,000 ) and arrange loans ( usually from $100,000 up ) among one another and with their customers over a telephone and Telex network . Fed most years by continuing U.S. payments deficits , the pool of money has grown geometrically from $8 billion in 1964 to $16 billion in 1967 to $27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of benefits and headaches . On the plus side , they provide a vital source of private capital to finance world trade and the growth of international corporations . They bankroll oil exploration , highway construction and even occasional European government deficits . Without them , Europe would lack the investment capital to sustain its present Dace of economic growth . The Eurodollar pool has also become a leading haven for nervous money . Fearful of devaluation , individual speculators and treasurers of large corporations swap comparatively weak currencies like British pounds or French francs for Eurodollars . <P> No government controls the supply of Eurodollars ; nor is there any regulation of the interest rates on Eurodollar loans or the uses to which they are put . Thus the expatriate dollars are extraordinarily sensitive to the gyrations of monetary supply and demand . They race across national boundaries in response to tiny changes in interest rates , and their existence complicates government efforts to curb currency speculation . It is hardly surprising that European moneymen have come to regard the Eurodollar as a genie that has somehow escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurodollar amounts to a new and highly controversial form of international currency . Last week in Strasbourg , Vice President Raymond Barre of the Common Market warned the European Parliament that Eurodollars have become " one of our continent 's top-priority problems . " <P> Financial leaders are particularly worried because the interest rates on Eurodollars have been rising with alarming speed . They jumped from 7% in December to a record 10% last week on three-month loans . Economic policymakers complain that the rise is leading to an unwanted worldwide increase in interest costs . <P> The immediate reason for the jump to last week 's peak was the rush to borrow Eurodollars for conversion into German marks . Big-time speculators found it much easier to borrow on the Eurodollar market than to dig into their own pockets for the money .
