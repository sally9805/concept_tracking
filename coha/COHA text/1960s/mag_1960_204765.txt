AN extraordinary accomplishment , " said the President of the U.S. , and so saying , he pinned a Legion of Merit on the much-decorated chest of Navy Captain Edward Latimer Beach last week . Ned Beach , 42 , had just made the kind of history that even Presidents can envy : under his command the world 's largest submarine , the nuclear , 3O-knot-plus U.S.S. Triton , had completed the first underwater circumnavigation of the globe . <P> Nominally , the trip was a shakedown cruise , but in laying down the global underseas voyage , the Navy also prescribed a variety of psychological experiments for the crew , as well as hydrographic tests , drills in reconnaissance and evasion of detection ( Triton was never sighted by ship or plane ) . For good measure , and possibly for good public relations , Triton followed a course close to the one sailed by Magellan and his men in 1519-22 . <P> Triton is the first nuclear submarine designed for the submarine 's classic role of scouting . Her job is to roam out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning the skies with powerful radar . She carries the biggest crew ( about 150 ) , and , powered by twin reactors , can dive faster and cruise farther than any of her nuclear sisters . <P> Skipper Beach ( Annapolis ' 39 ) is the son of the late Captain Edward Beach , who commanded the battleship New York in 1918-19 and who wrote Navy stories for children . Ned Beach won the Navy Cross , Silver Stars and a chestful of other medals as a World War II submariner , recorded his adventures in two big-selling books , Submarine ! and Run Silent , Run Deep ( a novel that was made into a movie in 1958 ) . <P> With his flair for capturing mood and action on paper , Beach kept an expansive log at sea that recorded everything from depth soundings to " babygrams " - eight Stateside messages informing sailors that their wives had given birth .
