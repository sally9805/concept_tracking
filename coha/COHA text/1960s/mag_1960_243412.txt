Aboard a British Comet airliner , the parents of U-2 Pilot Francis Powers landed at a Moscow airport one foggy morning last week , a few days before the start of his trial on charges of espionage . Oliver and Ida Powers were visibly tired , looked around at their new surroundings with wary eyes . " They are only poor country folk , " the family doctor , Lewis K. Ingram of Norton , Va. , confided to newsmen . " All this has been a terrible strain on them . " <P> Holding a press conference at his Russian hotel , Oliver Powers , tears in his eyes , read from a prepared statement : " I appeal to Mr. Khrushchev as one father to another for the sake of my boy . I understand that he lost a son in the war against Nazi Germany , fighting alongside the U.S. for the same cause . " A few hours later Pilot Powers ' wife Barbara landed in Moscow , accompanied by her mother , a physician and two family lawyers . Said Barbara : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , and then Mr. Khrushchev . " <P> <P> Attorneys of the Virginia Bar Association had mapped out a defense , even passed on their thoughts to Powers ' court-assigned Russian counsel , without much hope that he would heed them . They argued that Powers was not really a spy : he had not been caught in espionage on Russian soil , but had merely been flying in the open skies at the command of his Government . Echoed Barbara Powers : " He should have been called a scout for our Government . " It was a verbal distinction not likely to go far in a Russian court . <P> Signs were evident that the Russians were planning to put the U.S. on trial rather than Powers , using him as a pretext for a propaganda spectacular . The Kremlin laid down a steady propaganda barrage designed to stir up anger and suspicion toward the U.S. among the Russian people ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Said a Soviet radio broadcast : " Not only Powers , the immediate executor of the aggressive actions of the U.S. Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington as well . " Once the Russians get full propaganda use of him . Powers himself might get off with a light sentence . " Mr. Khrushchev , " said Oliver Powers , " cabled me , promising to help me in this matter , and I am taking him at his word . "
