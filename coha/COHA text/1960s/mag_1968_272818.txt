There is no question that LSD is a dangerous drug , and President Johnson last month asked Congress to make possession of it a misdemeanor , punishable with a $1,000 fine and up to a year in prison . He had the firm support of the Justice Department , but the medical men of the Food and Drug Administration were opposed on the ground that an anti-LSD law would be about as enforceable as the Volstead Act . Chief adversary was FDA Commissioner James L. Goddard , who four months ago complained publicly about the harshness of existing antimarijuana laws . In a surprising turn last week , Dr. Goddard reluctantly endorsed the Johnson LSD bill during a congressional hearing before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce . <P> Goddard also supported Johnson 's companion request to increase penalties for manufacturing , distributing and selling LSD and such stimulants and depressants as methedrine ( speed ) and phenobarbital . Under the bill , possession of the drugs would become a federal offense for the first time ( some 24 states now have laws prohibiting possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdemeanors punishable by up to a year and a $1,000 fine , would become felonies with penalties of up to five years and $10,000 . <P> Goddard made it clear that , personally , he opposed such harsh measures . But law-enforcement officials had convinced him that without the increased penalties their hands were tied . Peddlers of LSD and other drugs , they had pointed out to him , could claim that drugs they possessed were for personal use rather than sale under present law . Still , Goddard reported , the use of LSD is already on the decline . " Not because of penalties , " he said , but because of increasing awareness that it causes chromosomal damage .
