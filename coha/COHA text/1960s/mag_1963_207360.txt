One day last week , three impatient shrieks of a locomotive whistle shattered the morning calm of Sanlucar de Barra-meda , a small Spanish city in the grape country around Cadiz . On the dusty railroad platform , the stationmaster nervously paced back and forth waiting for the expected passengers , seasonal workers who commute to their jobs in the vineyards . But scarcely a soul showed up at the station , for in Sanlucar and nearby Jerez de la Frontera 3,900 workers were out on strike for a $2.50 daily wage ( a 50 boost ) , portal-to-portal pay between the vineyard and home , and two-not one-daily cigars , the slang word for the workers ' traditional 20-minute siesta . <P> <P> The strike was the latest and biggest in a wave of labor unrest that has swept Dictator Francisco Franco 's Spain this spring . In Barcelona the Hispano Suiza airplane-engine plant recently laid off 150 employees following a series of work slowdowns , was forced to hire them back when j.ooo Olivetti factory employees threatened a sympathy walkout . Two sitdown strikes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six hundred Madrid metalworkers have been threatening similar trouble after stubbornly refusing to sign a new contract . <P> Aid from the Priests . The complaints are many , for the Spanish worker puts in longer hours for less pay than almost any other worker in Western Europe , and strikes are legally banned . When El Caudillo granted substantial wage boosts for the 60,000 striking Asturias coal miners last summer , he merely whetted the appetites of workers in the rest of the country ; another increase last Jan. i , raising unskilled laborers from a minimum 60 to $1 per day , did not help the millions of skilled workers above this meager floor . <P> Openly backing the latest wave of strikes are the priests of the Workers ' Brotherhoods of Catholic Action and sev eral small but effective Catholic lay organizations that regularly blast the Can-ditto 's tight controls on workers from beneath the sheltering wing of the church . One such group , the Young Christian Workers , publishes an uncensored and outspoken monthly bulletin , Juventud Obrera , that demands free , Western-style labor unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and wages throughout the country . Said journal Editor Francisco Guerrero , 25 , describing his mission last week : " Our work is God 's answer to the evil negation of all human values . It is the only salvation for Spain 's masses , oppressed from above by Franco and menaced from below by the Communists . " <P> A Trip to Cadiz . Such frank talk has the regime seriously worried , and a few of the more progressive members of Franco 's authoritarian regime are anxiously trying to improve labor conditions . The Labor Ministry is preparing a bill to legalize " labor " strikes ( as distinct from " political " strikes ) . Another measure of the regime 's concern was the swift settlement of last week 's trouble among the vineyard workers of Sanlucar and Jerez . As soon as word of the work stoppage was flashed to Madrid , a Labor Ministry official raced to Cadiz and pressured vineyard employers into bowing to most of the worker demands , including more centimes as well as the second cigar .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
