The squat , angular jet looks ugly as a beetle with quadruple goiters , but airmen on both sides of the Atlantic were studying its unusual shape last week with unusual interest . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara 's announcement that the U.S. will contribute some $35 million toward further development of Britain 's P-1127 airplane made it clear that the odd craft is well in front in the race to develop a VTOL ( Vertical Take-Off and Landing ) plane . <P> Under hurry-up development by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. since 1959 , the P-1127 has convinced Pentagon authorities that it is two years ahead of U.S. rivals . It is built around the Bristol Siddeley BS-53 Pegasus , a remarkable jet engine that discharges large volumes of comparatively slow-speed air through four swiveling nozzles that can point either front , back or down . When the VTOL is ready for vertical takeoff , the pilot points all the nozzles down , revs the engine , and the plane rises straight up on an even keel . When sufficiently clear of the ground , the pilot turns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The P-1127 , which made its full flight test last fall , can land on a runway like an ordinary airplane or ease itself to the ground like a helicopter-supported by its four down-pointing nozzles . While it is hovering , four small air jets directed downward from the nose , tail and the wing tips give accurate control . Pilots of standard jets have little trouble with the P-1127 ; most learn to fly it in less than an hour . <P> The present P-1127 model is a small fighter plane that can carry weapons of moderate weight only . An improved model will be assigned to interception of enemy aircraft and to tactical duty with NATO and U.S. ground forces . But there seems to be no reason why it could not be stepped up in size . Big-brother VTOLs carrying Skybolt air-to-ground ballistic missiles ( TIME , April 27 ) could be securely hidden on small fields in such small , crowded countries as England or The Netherlands . Taking off from any road or cow pasture , most of them would be full of fight after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
