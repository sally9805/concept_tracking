THE WAR <P> ( See Cover ) <P> Crawling out of his sandbagged bunker , the helmeted Marine blinks in the afternoon light , cocks his head for a moment , listening intently , and then starts jogtrotting down the hill . With frayed trousers flapping and a cumbersome flak jacket jiggling against his bare chest , he makes his way through the debris of cartridge boxes and C-ration cans . Deep , viscous red mud sucks at his boots and oozes up to his knees as he struggles down the slope . Suddenly , from high above , comes a familiar , chilling whine . " Incoming ! " someone yells , and the leatherneck flattens himself in the mud . The artillery shell bursts 50 yards from him , gouging out a small crater through the slime . A breeze wafts away the cloud of smoke and detritus , the rifleman listens for a moment and then stands up . " Man ! " he exclaims , scraping mud from his caked body . " This just must be the worst place in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the autumn of 1967 . <P> In Vietnamese , the name means approximately " place of angels . " To the 1,200 U.S. Marines guarding it and to Americans watching their ordeal , Con Thien has come to mean something more akin to hell . Since Sept. 1 , the outpost , less than two miles from the southern edge of the six-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Viet Nams , has been under relentless bombardment from Communist guns . In one barrage last week , the Communists sent 903 artillery , mortar , rocket and recoilless-rifle shells whistling into the perimeter around Con Thien 's three barren , red clay hills-probably the greatest single Red bombardment of the war . In August , the leathernecks took 388 casualties along the northern defense line that stretches from the South China Sea to Khe Sanh in the mountainous borderlands near Laos ; in September , more than 2,200 Marines were killed and wounded . <P> Dangerous Detonations . In the U.S. , 10,000 miles away , Con Thien dramatized all the cumulative frustrations of the painful war . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans as the bloody , muddy ordeal of Con Thien flickered across the TV screen . With total U.S. casualties nearing 100,000 since 1961 , with the war 's cost running at $24 billion a year and with rumors circulating on Capitol Hill that Lyndon Johnson may need $4 billion more before the end of 1967 , there was a measurable increase in American unease and impatience . <P> Most pressing reasons for disquiet : <P> &gt; Rightly or wrongly , most Americans believe that the bombing of the North , which has drawn pungent worldwide criticism , has fallen far short of its objectives , whether to crimp the Communist war effort or to bring Hanoi to the negotiating table . <P> &gt; The Administration 's preoccupation with the war has seriously distracted its attention from crucial domestic issues , chilled relations with many of its allies , and diminished the prospects for any realistic rapprochement with Russia . <P> &gt; While the war is hardly beyond the means of the world 's wealthiest nation , many Americans are beginning to begrudge such vast expenditures as disproportionate to the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Viet Nam conflict has divided and disconcerted the nation more than any other single issue since the pre-Pearl Harbor debate over U.S.
