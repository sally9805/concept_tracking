txt Observer Encounter on : tile Oregon Trail By RUSSELL BAKER PENDLETON , Ore. , July 6 ? Back down the road a piece , along the Snake River , there was a grizzled mirage standing in the sage brush . There was nothing to do but photograph him , . but he was obviously uneasy and it was necessary to jolly him along with small talk . ? " Hello , there , old-timer . You 're a mirage , are n't you ? " " Yup " he said . " Lost ? " " I 'm looking for the Oregon Trail , " he said . " You have n't seen the wagons along this way by any chance ? " " Well , you see , old-timer , we do n't travel by wagon train any more . Nowadays we have cars . " He looked nonplused . " See that box sitting over there on wheels ? That 's a car . It goes 600 miles a day . When you people wanted to get to Oregon it took you five months from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He whistled in disbeFood lief . " What 's it like ? " and he asked . " Traveling in Snapshots one of those cars , I mean . " " Why , man , it 's the only way to see the country . I get in this car in Denver the desert and zoom along at 80 , running down prairie dogs , birds , snakes , heifers  --  anything that gets between me and Oregon . " " That 's right clever , " the oldtimer said . " Kills your food for you as it goes along . " He was hopeIlessly out of touch . " No , it just kills these animals because they get in the way . When we want to eat we stop at a burgerama and have some dehydrated , frozen , sanitized beef patties with plenty of catsup and mustard to give them taste . " " It 's a miracle , " the old-timer said . " If we 'd had some of those cars and burgeramas in ' 18 and ' 43 , we could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old fellow clawed some dust out of his beard and eyed the camera . " What 's that iron box ? " " This makes pictures . Just like little paintings . We come roaring across the desert at 80 miles an hour and see a fine big mountain or a vast dust bowl , and we take its picture . See ? " " I ca n't see what you Not want with a picture . See , for ing things with your own Beaver eyes is better than having little pictures of them . " He was pure 19th century . " Look , when you 're going toward Oregon at 600 miles a day , you do n't have time to look at anything but the road so you take pictures all along the way . Then when you get to Oregon you have a record of what you did n't see . " The old man changed the subject . " What are you going to do in Oregon ? " he asked . " Farm or trap beaver ? I hear the beaver up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has gotten away from you , Nobody traps beaver any more , and not many people farm . Nowadays people go to Oregan to sell cars or go into the burgerama business , and a lot of people go just so they can come back home and say they 've been there . That 's what we call tourism . " " A strange business , " A Case the old-timer grumbled . of Weak " You mean that people are Vision hurrying out there at 80 miles an hour , taking those silly newfangled pictures , killing the wildlife , killing their gizzards with that dehydrated , frozen , sanitized beef and not seeing anything along the way  --  and going to all that misery just so they can go back home and say they 've been there ? " " That 's what we call tourism , oldtinier . It 's one of the things that make this country dynamic , powerful , prosperous . And we owe it all to you for opening up this territory . You ought to be mighty proud . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted was beaver . I never thought I was leading the country into any such idle silliness as this . If you take my advice , young man , you will get out of that car , put that camera away , quit eating those burgers and go back to living . " With that he vanished irascibly . That was the trouble with those old-timers . The beaver blotted out their vision of the American future .
