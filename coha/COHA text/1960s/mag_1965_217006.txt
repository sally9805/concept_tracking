TRESS <P> Brooklyn <P> <P> Historian Schlesinger <P> Sir : As another historian , I commend you for honoring the craft with your cover story on Arthur Schlesinger Dec. 17 . I , too , would plump for activism because of its merit to the interpreter of history . However , there is a factor in such associations that Schlesinger fails to emphasize . That is the gracious receptivity of men such as his President and my Governor to interloping historians . Access is the key to effective political participation and observation , and Kennedy and Scranton have literally opened their offices to public scrutiny . <P> GEORGE D. WOLF <P> Special Assistant to the Governor <P> Harrisburg , Pa . <P> <P> Sir : According to TIME , Rusk considered Schlesinger one of the " biggest gossips in Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw him every two or three weeks . In reading his book , I was amazed to find all he knew and the experiences he shared with the President and others . Never did he ever give me the slightest hint of these activities and discussions . Until last month , I thought he was just a friend of the President . <P> SEYMOUR E. HARRIS <P> Chairman <P> Department of Economics <P> University of California <P> San Diego <P> Sir : Concerning the historian as participant : In 1892 President Eliot of Harvard notified Henry Adams that he would be the recipient of an honorary degree in recognition of his History of the United States . Adams declined , and urged that the honor be conferred on Nicolay and Hay for their Abraham Lincoln , A History . Eliot replied : " Those gentlemen did not write history , but the historical biography of a man just dead . They were actors in many of the scenes they described , and , therefore , could not be historians . They have prepared invaluable materials for the subsequent historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I submit that they have not written history . " I do n't agree , but that 's what the man said . <P> PAUL M. ANGLE
