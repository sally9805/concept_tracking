Helping many nations back to financial health , the U.S. throughout the postwar era has been able to put across most of its economic policies to the rest of the free world . Lately it has run into a high tide of economic nationalism that challenges the U.S. on matters as diverse as tariffs , money , and airport landing rights . Notably in a couple of major countries , and to a growing degree in other nations , U.S. economic policies are being criticized or rejected . <P> The chief economic antagonist of the U.S. is , of course , Charles de Gaulle , whose goal is to make Europe look to France instead of to the U.S. Largely because of France 's intransigence , the Kennedy Round of tariff-cutting talks in Geneva is deadlocked , dormant , and hopelessly behind schedule . The Common Market delegation in Geneva can not complete its list of proposed tariff cuts because France has boycotted major meetings of the Six since July 5 . <P> Money Maneuvers . In a direct maneuver against the U.S. , France last week tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international summit meeting to reform the world 's monetary system ( TIME , July 16 ) . Said French Finance Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing : " The suggested procedure of calling an international conference on this subject does not appear opportune . " Though many experts interpreted this politely phrased jab as a flat rejection , the fact was that Giscard d'Estaing said much the same thing that Fowler had said-that considerable negotiating has to be done before a summit can be convened . The Frenchman put it in a negative and scary way to remind the world that France has the power to obstruct a meeting . Conclusion : France probably will not prevent a conference but will hold out for a lot of preconditions , and a meeting may be a long time in coming . <P> France is hardly alone in questioning U.S. economic primacy . The continental nations generally would like to see the role of the dollar reduced in international finance . Policymakers in West Germany , The Netherlands and Switzerland have proposed or supported measures that would reduce the ability of U.S. businessmen to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who oppose De Gaulle , believe that by building a united Europe they can create an effective counterbalance to U.S. economic power . <P> An Equal Partner . Not all of the troublesome economic currents are transatlantic . In Washington two weeks ago , a delegation of Japanese Cabinet members jolted U.S. Cabinet members by demanding , in effect , that the U.S. begin treating Japan as an equal partner in economic matters . The visitors stiffly turned down U.S. requests for a lowering of Japanese tariffs against U.S. goods and restrictions against U.S. investments . They also declined a U.S. invitation to contribute to a billion-dollar aid program for Southeast Asia , rejected the U.S. suggestion that they withhold long-term credits from Communist China .
