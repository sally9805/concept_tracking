LETTERS TO A FRIEND ( 382 pp. ) - Rose Macau/a/-Atheneum ( $5 ) . <P> <P> Rose Macaulay died in 1958 at the age of 77 , one of Britain 's most distinguished ladies of letters , with some three dozen sharp , perceptive books to her credit . A Dame Commander of the British Empire , she was a witty , brittle bird of a woman who spread panic in the streets with her ancient auto , regularly bicycled down to bathe in London 's Serpentine when she was in her 70s , and published a satirical bestseller ( The Towers of Trebizond ) when she was 75 . <P> She never married . But in 1917 , when she was 36 and had written eight novels whose leading characters had a somewhat sexless quality and a tendency to first names that were appropriate to either man or woman . Rose Macaulay fell in love with a married man . Their affair continued some 20 years , until his death ; but only her immediate family and a few intimate friends knew of it until the publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written to an Anglican priest stationed near Boston , Mass. , who had known her slightly many years before and had written her in 1950 to say he liked one of her books . <P> In the exchange of letters that followed ( they never again met ) , the Rev. John Hamilton Cowper Johnson of the order known as the Cowley Fathers helped her return to the sacraments of the Church of England , from which her conscience had kept her during her long adultery . Though she asked , and expected , that the letters be destroyed , here they all are , from 1950 to 1952 ( another volume is to come ) , edited and with an introduction by her third cousin , Constance Babington-Smith . Numerous notable literary lights were scandalized when Letters to a Friend was published in England last October . Said Author Rebecca West : " It made me want to vomit . " But according to Editor Babington-Smith , Father Johnson and Rose Macaulay 's spinster sister , Jean , felt that the letters might be " of inestimable value and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to see how . Their religious element is mostly discussion of erudite Anglican minutiae and spiritual snobbisms that are more likely to chill the unconverted than warm them . They are loaded with off-the-cuff comments that Rose Macaulay herself would have been distressed to see in print . And it is doubtful that many sinners will be changed by her moving repentance of her life 's love : " I told you once that I could n't really regret the past . But now I do regret it , very much . . . Not all the long years of happiness together , of love and friendship and almost perfect companionship ( in spite of its background ) was worth while , it cost too much , to us and to other people . I did n't know that before , but I do now . And he had no life after it to be different in , and I have lived the greater part of mine . If only I had refused and gone on refusing . " <P> " Letters should be burned , " she once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amusing , crotchety , churchy letters to Father Johnson ends : " I 'm glad you like to have my letters . Really 100 ? I think you 'd better get rid of them , of any you have kept , in that incinerator ! I own I have kept yours . . . but I will burn them before I die ; they 're not for other people to see .
