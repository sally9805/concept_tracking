TIME has had frequent occasion in the past few years to speculate on the future of France and the rest of the world aprs De Gaulle . When mirage became reality on the evening of April 27 , our correspondents were well-prepared to cover the cataclysm . Sensing in advance that France would say non to the general , Paris Bureau Chief William Rademaekers , a veteran European reporter , had assigned six correspondents-all French-speaking-to cover France 's leading politicians , four major provincial cities and news sources in the capital . <P> At 4:40 p.m. that Sunday , about 13 hours after TIME had closed in New York , Rademaekers called the editors to warn that , with a third of the vote counted , De Gaulle seemed likely to lose the election . With that , a crew of editors , writers and researchers set out to describe and dissect the fall of De Gaulle in a two-page report that appeared in last week 's TIME . No other newsmagazine carried a line on that epochal event . <P> This week 's cover story on Georges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present political turmoil within France to examine the reasons for the general 's defeat , the mood of France in 1969 and the prospects for change . The story was written by Contributing Editor William Doerner and edited by Senior Editor Jason McManus , who , as TIME 'S Paris-based Common Market correspondent from 1962 to 1964 , covered Britain 's first bid to join Europe and De Gaulle 's abrupt rejection of that effort . <P> For journalists , covering President De Gaulle was almost as arduous and frustrating an assignment as reporting on mainland China from Hong Kong . One of the most expert Gaullologists in the business is Curtis Prendergast , now TIME 'S London bureau chief , who contributed to this week 's cover . During a nine-year term in Paris , Prendergast accompanied the general on ten tours of France 's provinces and two dramatic descents on war-torn Algeria , as well as on ceremonial visits to Senegal , Mauritania , Greece , Mexico , the West Indies and Cambodia . <P> <P> TIME 'S first cover story on De Gaulle ran in the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure , if fractious , leader-in-exile of Nazi-occupied France . Since then he has been the subject of nine other TIME cover stories and appeared last when he said non to devaluation of the franc . His successor could hardly match the general 's flair for making news-or , for that matter , his disdain for the press . Reported Paris Bureau Chief Rademaekers : " One covered De Gaulle from a distance-like a moon shot . Journalists invited to visit the Elysee Palace always entered by the servants ' entrance . We still enter by the same door , but the mood and the attitude inside have noticeably changed . " As TIME 'S cover story suggests , Georges Pompidou , or any other aspirant to the 23rd presidency of France , may at least admit the world 's press by the front door .
